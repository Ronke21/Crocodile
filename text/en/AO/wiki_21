<text>Shalmaneser II (Salmānu-ašarēd II, inscribed md&quot;-ma-nu-&quot;/, meaning &quot;Being peaceful is foremost&quot;) was the king of Assyria in 1030–1019 BC, the 93rd to appear on the &quot;Khorsabad&quot; copy of the Assyrian Kinglist, although he has been apparently carelessly omitted altogether on the &quot;Nassouhi&quot; copy.

==Biography==

In recent years, there has been a trend towards reading the in his name as &quot;sal&quot; rather than &quot;šul&quot; on philological grounds. He succeeded his father, Aššur-nāṣir-apli I and ruled for 12 years according to the Assyrian Kingliest and confirmed by a heavily damaged fragment of an eponym list (pictured). Of the twelve limmu officials listed, only the names of the first two have been substantially preserved, that of Shalmaneser himself, who took the eponymy in his first year, and &quot;-mu-šab-&quot;[&quot;ši&quot;]. The twelfth entry &quot;ša ar&quot;[&quot;ki si&quot;...] indicates that the limmu &quot;which is after&quot; (the previous name) either suggesting that the original from which this list was copied was defective in this place or the gap in the office coincides with a period of turbulence.

In the &quot;Synchronistic Kingliest&quot; he is listed beside his Babylonian counterpart, Eulmash-shakin-shumi (1004–988 BC) of the Bῑt-Bazi dynasty, an unlikely pairing reflecting perhaps the isolation of the two kingdoms at the time. In all likelihood, he reigned concurrently with Nabu-shum-libur (1033–1026 BC) and Simbar-shipak (1025–1008 BC), whose reigns were characterized by droughts, crop failures and incursions by Arameans, migrating under the pressure from climate change. The later king, Aššur-dān II (935–912 BC), recalled Shalmaneser &#x27;s own losses to this tribal group:

Another retrospective reference can probably be found in an inscription of Ashurnasirpal II unless it refers to the earlier king by this name. It relates &quot;I repossessed the cities of Sinabu (and) Tidu—fortresses which Salmānu-ašarēd, king of Assyria, a prince who preceded me, had garrisoned against the land of Nairi (and) which the Arameans had captured by force.&quot;

There are few inscriptions which may be attributed for certainty to him as several may belong to the Shalmaneser I who preceded him, or to one of the three who followed. Of those that can be reliably attributed, a monumental stele (number 14) from Aššur, from the Stelenreihe, &quot;row of stelae,&quot; provides his genealogy thus permitting identification but nothing else. It reads: &quot;Shalmaneser , great king, king of the universe, king of Assyria, son of Aššur-nāṣir-apli (I), king of Assyria, son of Šamši-adad (IV), who was also king of Assyria&quot;. A temple endowment lists quantities of cedar balsam (&quot;dam erêni&quot;) donated by the king to the Assurtemple and its &quot;temples&quot; and includes the provision of a quantity of aromatics to Idiglat, the deified river Tigris. There is a long dedication inscription of Shalmaneser , II or III undetermined, to Ištar composed for the consecration of a temple. A gold and a silver disk are inscribed with the name &quot;Salmānu-ašarēd&quot; and could possibly represent this king or his predecessor.

He was succeeded by his son, the briefly reigning Ashur-nirari IV, and then his brother Ashur-rabi II.

<text>Boy Meets World is an American coming-of-age sitcom created by Michael Jacobs and April Kelly that aired on ABC for seven seasons between September1993 and May2000. The series centers on Cory Matthews (Ben Savage) and his friends and family, as he progresses from childhood to adulthood. Episodes chronicle the everyday events of Cory&#x27;s home and school life; his teacher and neighbor George Feeny (William Daniels) delivers life lessons as Cory learns to cope with social and personal issues of adolescence. Cory has strong relationships with his older brother Eric (Will Friedle), younger sister Morgan (Lily Nicksay), and parents, Amy (Betsy Randle) and Alan (William Russ). Cory&#x27;s friendship with Shawn Hunter (Rider Strong) and romantic interest in Topanga Lawrence (Danielle Fishel) serve as central focuses of episodes. Overarching themes include a focus on family and friendships as well as discovering one&#x27;s identity. Further characters were introduced in later seasons; Jonathan Turner (Anthony Tyler Quinn), Eli Williams (Alex Désert), Jack Hunter (Matthew Lawrence), Angela Moore (Trina McGee-Davis) and Rachel McGuire (Maitland Ward).

The Walt Disney Company commissioned the series for its youth-oriented TGIF programming block airing on ABC. Jacobs had previously produced &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; for the block and was asked to create a new series for a 12-to-14-year-old audience. Savage was under a contract with ABC at the time and Jacobs chose to include him as the central character. &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; was produced by Michael Jacobs Productions and Touchstone Television, and premiered on ABC on September 24, 1993. The series concluded on May 5, 2000, as a result of the aging cast and a shift in the network&#x27;s programming directives.

&quot;Boy Meets World&quot; experienced strong ratings for the teenage demographic throughout its seven seasons, and it was later syndicated on Disney Channel. Several cast members were nominated for Young Artist Awards. Savage and Fishel reprised their roles as series regulars in the spin-off &quot;Girl Meets World&quot;, which aired on Disney Channel from 2014 to 2017, and depicted Cory and Topanga as married parents.

==Plot==
Cory Matthews (Ben Savage) is a witty 11-year-old middle school student in Philadelphia, who speaks his mind and has an interest in sports. He shares a love-hate relationship with his sixth-grade teacher and neighbor George Feeny (William Daniels), and often finds himself in trouble during class. Cory&#x27;s relationship with his older brother Eric (Will Friedle) becomes strained when Eric&#x27;s obsession with dating girls, which is a foreign concept to Cory, begins to take precedence over the time they spend together. Cory shares a strong bond with his parents, Amy (Betsy Randle) and Alan (William Russ), and his younger sister Morgan (Lily Nicksay). His classmates include his best friend Shawn Hunter (Rider Strong), the intelligent Stuart Minkus (Lee Norris), and the nonconformist Topanga (Danielle Fishel), for whom he gradually begins to develop feelings.

In the second season, Cory, Shawn, and Topanga begin high school and are taught by Jonathan Turner (Anthony Tyler Quinn), an unorthodox English teacher, while Mr. Feeny becomes their principal. Cory and Topanga admit their feelings for each other and begin dating in the third season, while Eric is not accepted to any colleges or universities following his high school graduation. The fourth season includes Eric revisiting his studies and Alan opening a sporting goods store with Eric as his partner. Eric begins college in the fifth season and moves into an apartment with Jack (Matthew Lawrence), whom he learns is Shawn&#x27;s half-brother. Throughout the season, Shawn develops a relationship with a new student, Angela (Trina McGee), and Amy becomes pregnant. Topanga is accepted to Yale University, but rejects the offer to remain close to Cory, which leads her to propose to him at their graduation.

In the sixth season, Cory and his friends begin college, where Mr. Feeny is offered a teaching job. Rachel McGuire (Maitland Ward) moves in with Eric and Jack and they both develop feelings for her; Jack dates her. The new Matthews baby, Joshua, is born prematurely. Cory and Topanga get married in the seventh season and move into an apartment on campus. The series concludes with Cory, Topanga, Shawn, and Eric moving to New York City, when Topanga secures an internship at a law firm, while Jack and Rachel join the Peace Corps and Angela moves to Europe for a year with her dad.

==Production==
===Development and casting===
&quot;Boy Meets World&quot; was created to air on the TGIF programming block which had been airing on ABC since 1989. The series was created by Michael Jacobs, who produced &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; for the same block. Jacobs was approached by a Disney executive after the conclusion of &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;, to write a new series for the 12 to 14-year-old demographic. Jacobs noticed how other sitcoms focused on the oldest child of a family, which led him to create &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; with the middle child as the central character.

Ben Savage was already under a contract at ABC at 11 years old when Jacobs chose to include him in the series, which became known as &quot;The Ben Savage Project&quot;. Jacobs wanted to work with William Daniels, but Daniels was apprehensive about acting in a sitcom and initially rejected the offer before asking for the pilot to be re-written. Daniels had threatened to quit, and told Jacobs he did not want the role of Mr. Feeny to make fun of teachers, but knew the character would be respected when Jacobs stated it was based on a mentor of his. Rider Strong was the first actor to audition for the role of Shawn and was successful. Strong&#x27;s older brother Shiloh Strong was shortlisted to play Eric alongside Jason Marsden and Will Friedle; Friedle secured the role, however, a different actor portrayed Eric in the unaired pilot. Danielle Fishel was not the original actor cast as Topanga, but she assumed the role before the character&#x27;s first episode; Jacobs also threatened to fire Fishel during the filming week.

&quot;Boy Meets World&quot; was renewed for a fifth season in April 1997. In the fifth season, Matthew Lawrence joined the cast as Jack Hunter, Eric&#x27;s college roommate. Daniels&#x27; wife Bonnie Bartlett portrays the recurring role of Dean Bolander, the dean of the university, in the later seasons of the show.

===Writing and filming===
During the writing of the pilot, network executives removed the episode&#x27;s references to Shakespeare, considering these elements as too mature for the audience. The episode was poorly received at the table read, and Jacobs re-wrote the pilot overnight. Part of the rewrite was to ensure that Mr. Feeny was portrayed in a way that was respectful of teachers and did not make fun of them, at Daniels&#x27; request. Strong later commented on the difficult atmosphere of filming on-set, which he described as a &quot;damaging&quot; environment that was cultivated by Jacobs, who had high expectations of the cast. Director David Trainer stated that Jacobs used &quot;emotional manipulation&quot; on the younger cast.

The chemistry between Savage and Fishel led to producers developing a romantic relationship between Cory and Topanga. Jacobs was told by an ABC executive that marrying the pair would be irresponsible, before a favorable Internet poll led to the decision being approved. As the series progressed, Eric&#x27;s characterization became more foolish and unintelligent to accommodate Friedle&#x27;s comedic abilities.

Jeff Sherman, who was a producer and writer on the show, advocated to include issues such as vandalism and child abuse in the series, regardless of it being a comedy. An episode in the first season, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, discusses the idea of running away from home. Bob Tischler served as an executive producer alongside Jacobs towards the end of the show&#x27;s run.

===Conclusion===
&quot;Boy Meets World&quot; was renewed for a sixth season in April 1998. &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;, another series airing on Friday nights, was the only other show to be renewed that year. By this time, the ratings for &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; had decreased by 14% from the last season, and the TGIF ratings had decreased by 17% overall.

In 2000, &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;, moved from airing on ABC to the WB; by this stage, it was expected that &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; would also end its run, causing doubt about the future of the block. By April, production on the seventh season of &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; had concluded, and Savage was already planning on attending college. The series did not produce a &quot;large-scale&quot; series finale, and there was a possibility the show could return. In the same month, ABC officially announced that the seventh season would be the final season of the show. The hour-long series finale aired on May 5, 2000, in which Cory and Topanga consider moving to New York.

==Series overview==

==Broadcast==
===Syndication and streaming===
&quot;Boy Meets World&quot; reruns began airing on various Fox, WB, UPN, and independent affiliates from September 8, 1997 to September 1, 2000. During the latter month, Disney Channel assumed syndication rights, with the series running on the cable channel until 2007. ABC Family aired &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; from June 21, 2004 to August 31, 2007 and again from April 12, 2010 to December 2, 2015. The series also began airing on MTV2 since November 14, 2011. On May 5, 2014, the show temporarily returned to Disney Channel after a seven-year absence to promote &quot;Girl Meets World&quot;.

On September 29, 2017, &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; became available for streaming on Hulu along with fellow Disney–ABC television properties &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; and &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, in addition to fellow TGIF programs &quot;Family Matters&quot;, &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot;, &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;, and &quot;Step by Step&quot;. On April 11, 2019, it was confirmed that Disney+, a new streaming service owned by Disney, would be carrying the series upon its November 2019 launch.

== Reception ==
===Viewership===
&quot;Boy Meets World&quot; experienced strong ratings for the teenage demographic. During the airing of the fifth season in 1997–98, &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; was the winner of its timeslot among children, teenagers and adults aged 18–49, while placing second in its timeslot overall. The series was on average receiving a 14% decrease in ratings from the previous season. It was described as the number 2 series for children on primetime television. By the airing of the seventh season, the ratings had continued to decline as the audience for the TGIF block decreased.

===Cultural impact===
Angela&#x27;s interracial relationship with Shawn was a relative rarity for a major network television show targeting youths at the time. Trina McGee-Davis once remarked that the typical reaction she received from young fans regarding the relationship was overwhelmingly positive and encouraging, often inquiring as to when the characters would reconcile after a breakup. She expressed her personal wish that her character&#x27;s relationship would serve as an example of color blindness for the world, in lieu of a less positive reaction a similar relationship had received on &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; at the time.

Eric and Shawn both wore a popular 1990s hairstyle called curtained hair.

The show also addresses the cultural issues of child abuse (&quot;Dangerous Secret&quot;), sexual harassment (&quot;Chick Like Me&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves Stuart&quot;), and underage drinking/alcohol use (&quot;If You Can&#x27;t Be with the One You Love…&quot;).

===Awards and nominations===

<text>In mathematics, a ratio () shows how many times one number contains another. For example, if there are eight oranges and six lemons in a bowl of fruit, then the ratio of oranges to lemons is eight to six (that is, 8:6, which is equivalent to the ratio 4:3). Similarly, the ratio of lemons to oranges is 6:8 (or 3:4) and the ratio of oranges to the total amount of fruit is 8:14 (or 4:7).

The numbers in a ratio may be quantities of any kind, such as counts of people or objects, or such as measurements of lengths, weights, time, etc. In most contexts, both numbers are restricted to be positive.

A ratio may be specified either by giving both constituting numbers, written as &quot;&quot;a&quot; to &quot;b&quot; or &quot;a:b&quot;&quot;, or by giving just the value of their quotient Equal quotients correspond to equal ratios.
A statement expressing the equality of two ratios is called a proportion.

Consequently, a ratio may be considered as an ordered pair of numbers, a fraction with the first number in the numerator and the second in the denominator, or as the value denoted by this fraction. Ratios of counts, given by (non-zero) natural numbers, are rational numbers, and may sometimes be natural numbers. 

A more specific definition adopted in physical sciences (especially in metrology) for &quot;ratio&quot; is the dimensionless quotient between two physical quantities measured with the same unit. A quotient of two quantities that are measured with units may be called a &quot;rate&quot;.

== Notation and terminology ==
The ratio of numbers &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; can be expressed as:
*the ratio of &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;
*&quot;A:B&quot;
*&quot;A&quot; is to &quot;B&quot; (when followed by &quot;as &quot;C&quot; is to &quot;D&quot;&quot;; see below)
*a fraction with &quot;A&quot; as numerator and &quot;B&quot; as denominator that represents the quotient (i.e., &quot;A&quot; divided by &quot;B, or&quot; formula_1). This can be expressed as a simple or a decimal fraction, or as a percentage, etc.

When a ratio is written in the form &quot;A&quot;:&quot;B&quot;, the two-dot character is sometimes the colon punctuation mark. In Unicode, this is , although Unicode also provides a dedicated ratio character, .

The numbers &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are sometimes called &quot;terms of the ratio&quot;, with &quot;A&quot; being the &quot;antecedent&quot; and &quot;B&quot; being the &quot;consequent&quot;.

A statement expressing the equality of two ratios &quot;A&quot;:&quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot;:&quot;D&quot; is called a proportion, written as &quot;A&quot;:&quot;B&quot; = &quot;C&quot;:&quot;D&quot; or &quot;A&quot;:&quot;B&quot;∷&quot;C&quot;:&quot;D&quot;. This latter form, when spoken or written in the English language, is often expressed as
:(&quot;A&quot; is to &quot;B&quot;) as (&quot;C&quot; is to &quot;D&quot;).

&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are called the terms of the proportion. &quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are called its &quot;extremes&quot;, and &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; are called its &quot;means&quot;. The equality of three or more ratios, like &quot;A&quot;:&quot;B&quot; = &quot;C&quot;:&quot;D&quot; = &quot;E&quot;:&quot;F&quot;, is called a continued proportion.

Ratios are sometimes used with three or even more terms, e.g., the proportion for the edge lengths of a &quot;two by four&quot; that is ten inches long is therefore
:formula_2
:(unplaned measurements; the first two numbers are reduced slightly when the wood is planed smooth)

a good concrete mix (in volume units) is sometimes quoted as
:formula_3

For a (rather dry) mixture of 4/1 parts in volume of cement to water, it could be said that the ratio of cement to water is 4:1, that there is 4 times as much cement as water, or that there is a quarter (1/4) as much water as cement.

The meaning of such a proportion of ratios with more than two terms is that the ratio of any two terms on the left-hand side is equal to the ratio of the corresponding two terms on the right-hand side.

==History and etymology==
It is possible to trace the origin of the word &quot;ratio&quot; to the Ancient Greek (&quot;logos&quot;). Early translators rendered this into Latin as &#x27; (&quot;reason&quot;; as in the word &quot;rational&quot;). A more modern interpretation of Euclid&#x27;s meaning is more akin to computation or reckoning. Medieval writers used the word &#x27; (&quot;proportion&quot;) to indicate ratio and &quot;&quot; (&quot;proportionality&quot;) for the equality of ratios.

Euclid collected the results appearing in the Elements from earlier sources. The Pythagoreans developed a theory of ratio and proportion as applied to numbers. The Pythagoreans&#x27; conception of number included only what would today be called rational numbers, casting doubt on the validity of the theory in geometry where, as the Pythagoreans also discovered, incommensurable ratios (corresponding to irrational numbers) exist. The discovery of a theory of ratios that does not assume commensurability is probably due to Eudoxus of Cnidus. The exposition of the theory of proportions that appears in Book VII of The Elements reflects the earlier theory of ratios of commensurables.

The existence of multiple theories seems unnecessarily complex since ratios are, to a large extent, identified with quotients and their prospective values. However, this is a comparatively recent development, as can be seen from the fact that modern geometry textbooks still use distinct terminology and notation for ratios and quotients. The reasons for this are twofold: first, there was the previously mentioned reluctance to accept irrational numbers as true numbers, and second, the lack of a widely used symbolism to replace the already established terminology of ratios delayed the full acceptance of fractions as alternative until the 16th century.

===Euclid&#x27;s definitions===
Book V of Euclid&#x27;s Elements has 18 definitions, all of which relate to ratios. In addition, Euclid uses ideas that were in such common usage that he did not include definitions for them. The first two definitions say that a &quot;part&quot; of a quantity is another quantity that &quot;measures&quot; it and conversely, a &quot;multiple&quot; of a quantity is another quantity that it measures. In modern terminology, this means that a multiple of a quantity is that quantity multiplied by an integer greater than one—and a part of a quantity (meaning aliquot part) is a part that, when multiplied by an integer greater than one, gives the quantity.

Euclid does not define the term &quot;measure&quot; as used here, However, one may infer that if a quantity is taken as a unit of measurement, and a second quantity is given as an integral number of these units, then the first quantity &quot;measures&quot; the second. These definitions are repeated, nearly word for word, as definitions 3 and 5 in book VII.

Definition 3 describes what a ratio is in a general way. It is not rigorous in a mathematical sense and some have ascribed it to Euclid&#x27;s editors rather than Euclid himself. Euclid defines a ratio as between two quantities &quot;of the same type&quot;, so by this definition the ratios of two lengths or of two areas are defined, but not the ratio of a length and an area. Definition 4 makes this more rigorous. It states that a ratio of two quantities exists, when there is a multiple of each that exceeds the other. In modern notation, a ratio exists between quantities &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;, if there exist integers &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;mp&quot;&gt;&quot;q&quot; and &quot;nq&quot;&gt;&quot;p&quot;. This condition is known as the Archimedes property.

Definition 5 is the most complex and difficult. It defines what it means for two ratios to be equal. Today, this can be done by simply stating that ratios are equal when the quotients of the terms are equal, but such a definition would have been meaningless to Euclid. In modern notation, Euclid&#x27;s definition of equality is that given quantities &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot;, &quot;p&quot;:&quot;q&quot;∷&quot;r&quot;:&quot;s&quot; if and only if, for any positive integers &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, &quot;np&quot;&lt;&quot;mq&quot;, &quot;np&quot;=&quot;mq&quot;, or &quot;np&quot;&gt;&quot;mq&quot; according as &quot;nr&quot;&lt;&quot;ms&quot;, &quot;nr&quot;=&quot;ms&quot;, or &quot;nr&quot;&gt;&quot;ms&quot;, respectively. This definition has affinities with Dedekind cuts as, with &quot;n&quot; and &quot;q&quot; both positive, &quot;np&quot; stands to &quot;mq&quot; as stands to the rational number (dividing both terms by &quot;nq&quot;).

Definition 6 says that quantities that have the same ratio are &quot;proportional&quot; or &quot;in proportion&quot;. Euclid uses the Greek ἀναλόγον (analogon), this has the same root as λόγος and is related to the English word &quot;analog&quot;.

Definition 7 defines what it means for one ratio to be less than or greater than another and is based on the ideas present in definition 5. In modern notation it says that given quantities &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot;, &quot;p&quot;:&quot;q&quot;&gt;&quot;r&quot;:&quot;s&quot; if there are positive integers &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; so that &quot;np&quot;&gt;&quot;mq&quot; and &quot;nr&quot;≤&quot;ms&quot;.

As with definition 3, definition 8 is regarded by some as being a later insertion by Euclid&#x27;s editors. It defines three terms &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot; and &quot;r&quot; to be in proportion when &quot;p&quot;:&quot;q&quot;∷&quot;q&quot;:&quot;r&quot;. This is extended to four terms &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot; as &quot;p&quot;:&quot;q&quot;∷&quot;q&quot;:&quot;r&quot;∷&quot;r&quot;:&quot;s&quot;, and so on. Sequences that have the property that the ratios of consecutive terms are equal are called geometric progressions. Definitions 9 and 10 apply this, saying that if &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot; and &quot;r&quot; are in proportion then &quot;p&quot;:&quot;r&quot; is the &quot;duplicate ratio&quot; of &quot;p&quot;:&quot;q&quot; and if &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot; are in proportion then &quot;p&quot;:&quot;s&quot; is the &quot;triplicate ratio&quot; of &quot;p&quot;:&quot;q&quot;.

==Number of terms and use of fractions==
In general, a comparison of the quantities of a two-entity ratio can be expressed as a fraction derived from the ratio. For example, in a ratio of 2:3, the amount, size, volume, or quantity of the first entity is formula_4 that of the second entity.

If there are 2 oranges and 3 apples, the ratio of oranges to apples is 2:3, and the ratio of oranges to the total number of pieces of fruit is 2:5. These ratios can also be expressed in fraction form: there are 2/3 as many oranges as apples, and 2/5 of the pieces of fruit are oranges. If orange juice concentrate is to be diluted with water in the ratio 1:4, then one part of concentrate is mixed with four parts of water, giving five parts total; the amount of orange juice concentrate is 1/4 the amount of water, while the amount of orange juice concentrate is 1/5 of the total liquid. In both ratios and fractions, it is important to be clear what is being compared to what, and beginners often make mistakes for this reason.

Fractions can also be inferred from ratios with more than two entities; however, a ratio with more than two entities cannot be completely converted into a single fraction, because a fraction can only compare two quantities. A separate fraction can be used to compare the quantities of any two of the entities covered by the ratio: for example, from a ratio of 2:3:7 we can infer that the quantity of the second entity is formula_5 that of the third entity.

==Proportions and percentage ratios==
If we multiply all quantities involved in a ratio by the same number, the ratio remains valid. For example, a ratio of 3:2 is the same as 12:8. It is usual either to reduce terms to the lowest common denominator, or to express them in parts per hundred (percent).

If a mixture contains substances A, B, C and D in the ratio 5:9:4:2 then there are 5 parts of A for every 9 parts of B, 4 parts of C and 2 parts of D. As 5+9+4+2=20, the total mixture contains 5/20 of A (5 parts out of 20), 9/20 of B, 4/20 of C, and 2/20 of D. If we divide all numbers by the total and multiply by 100, we have converted to percentages: 25% A, 45% B, 20% C, and 10% D (equivalent to writing the ratio as 25:45:20:10).

If the two or more ratio quantities encompass all of the quantities in a particular situation, it is said that &quot;the whole&quot; contains the sum of the parts: for example, a fruit basket containing two apples and three oranges and no other fruit is made up of two parts apples and three parts oranges. In this case, formula_6, or 40% of the whole is apples and formula_7, or 60% of the whole is oranges. This comparison of a specific quantity to &quot;the whole&quot; is called a proportion.

If the ratio consists of only two values, it can be represented as a fraction, in particular as a decimal fraction. For example, older televisions have a 4:3 &quot;aspect ratio&quot;, which means that the width is 4/3 of the height (this can also be expressed as 1.33:1 or just 1.33 rounded to two decimal places). More recent widescreen TVs have a 16:9 aspect ratio, or 1.78 rounded to two decimal places. One of the popular widescreen movie formats is 2.35:1 or simply 2.35. Representing ratios as decimal fractions simplifies their comparison. When comparing 1.33, 1.78 and 2.35, it is obvious which format offers wider image. Such a comparison works only when values being compared are consistent, like always expressing width in relation to height.

==Reduction==
Ratios can be reduced (as fractions are) by dividing each quantity by the common factors of all the quantities. As for fractions, the simplest form is considered that in which the numbers in the ratio are the smallest possible integers.

Thus, the ratio 40:60 is equivalent in meaning to the ratio 2:3, the latter being obtained from the former by dividing both quantities by 20. Mathematically, we write 40:60 = 2:3, or equivalently 40:60∷2:3. The verbal equivalent is &quot;40 is to 60 as 2 is to 3.&quot;

A ratio that has integers for both quantities and that cannot be reduced any further (using integers) is said to be in simplest form or lowest terms.

Sometimes it is useful to write a ratio in the form 1:&quot;x&quot; or &quot;x&quot;:1, where &quot;x&quot; is not necessarily an integer, to enable comparisons of different ratios. For example, the ratio 4:5 can be written as 1:1.25 (dividing both sides by 4) Alternatively, it can be written as 0.8:1 (dividing both sides by 5).

Where the context makes the meaning clear, a ratio in this form is sometimes written without the 1 and the ratio symbol (:), though, mathematically, this makes it a factor or multiplier.

==Irrational ratios==
Ratios may also be established between incommensurable quantities (quantities whose ratio, as value of a fraction, amounts to an irrational number). The earliest discovered example, found by the Pythagoreans, is the ratio of the length of the diagonal to the length of a side of a square, which is the square root of 2, formally formula_8 Another example is the ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its diameter, which is called , and is not just an irrational number, but a transcendental number.

Also well known is the golden ratio of two (mostly) lengths and , which is defined by the proportion
: formula_9 or, equivalently formula_10
Taking the ratios as fractions and formula_11 as having the value , yields the equation
:formula_12 or formula_13
which has the positive, irrational solution formula_14
Thus at least one of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; has to be irrational for them to be in the golden ratio. An example of an occurrence of the golden ratio in math is as the limiting value of the ratio of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers: even though all these ratios are ratios of two integers and hence are rational, the limit of the sequence of these rational ratios is the irrational golden ratio.

Similarly, the silver ratio of and is defined by the proportion
:formula_15 corresponding to formula_16 
This equation has the positive, irrational solution formula_17 so again at least one of the two quantities &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; in the silver ratio must be irrational.

==Odds==

&quot;Odds&quot; (as in gambling) are expressed as a ratio. For example, odds of &quot;7 to 3 against&quot; (7:3) mean that there are seven chances that the event will not happen to every three chances that it will happen. The probability of success is 30%. In every ten trials, there are expected to be three wins and seven losses.

==Units==
Ratios may be unitless, as in the case they relate quantities in units of the same dimension, even if their units of measurement are initially different.
For example, the ratio can be reduced by changing the first value to 60 seconds, so the ratio becomes . Once the units are the same, they can be omitted, and the ratio can be reduced to 3:2.

On the other hand, there are non-dimensionless quotients, also known as &quot;rates&quot; (sometimes also as ratios).
In chemistry, mass concentration ratios are usually expressed as weight/volume fractions.
For example, a concentration of 3% w/v usually means 3 g of substance in every 100 mL of solution. This cannot be converted to a dimensionless ratio, as in weight/weight or volume/volume fractions.

==Triangular coordinates==

The locations of points relative to a triangle with vertices &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; and sides &quot;AB&quot;, &quot;BC&quot;, and &quot;CA&quot; are often expressed in extended ratio form as &quot;triangular coordinates&quot;.

In barycentric coordinates, a point with coordinates &quot;α, β, γ&quot; is the point upon which a weightless sheet of metal in the shape and size of the triangle would exactly balance if weights were put on the vertices, with the ratio of the weights at &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; being &quot;α&quot; : &quot;β&quot;, the ratio of the weights at &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; being &quot;β&quot; : &quot;γ&quot;, and therefore the ratio of weights at &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; being &quot;α&quot; : &quot;γ&quot;.

In trilinear coordinates, a point with coordinates &quot;x&quot;:&quot;y&quot;:&quot;z&quot; has perpendicular distances to side &quot;BC&quot; (across from vertex &quot;A&quot;) and side &quot;CA&quot; (across from vertex &quot;B&quot;) in the ratio &quot;x&quot;:&quot;y&quot;, distances to side &quot;CA&quot; and side &quot;AB&quot; (across from &quot;C&quot;) in the ratio &quot;y&quot;:&quot;z&quot;, and therefore distances to sides &quot;BC&quot; and &quot;AB&quot; in the ratio &quot;x&quot;:&quot;z&quot;.

Since all information is expressed in terms of ratios (the individual numbers denoted by &quot;α, β, γ, x, y,&quot; and &quot;z&quot; have no meaning by themselves), a triangle analysis using barycentric or trilinear coordinates applies regardless of the size of the triangle.

<text>Superdupont is a French comic strip created in 1972 by Marcel Gotlib and Jacques Lob. It is a spoof of American super-hero comics that sends up French national attitudes.

==Publication history==
&quot;Superdupont&quot; was initially published in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Pilote&quot; from September 21, 1972 and moved to Gotlib&#x27;s own magazine &quot;Fluide Glacial&quot; in 1975.

The series, published irregularly through the decades, was originally written by Lob and Gotlib (who teamed up after finding out they had both had the same idea independently) and drawn by Gotlib. Gotlib passed on the art duties to Alexis, who was succeeded after his 1977 death by Jean Solé. Episodes have been drawn by Daniel Goossens, Al Coutelis, François Bouck, Gotlib again and Neal Adams. After Lob died in 1990, the series was written again by Gotlib with co-writers Lefred-Thouron, Bouck, then Belkrouf. No Superdupont comics have been made since Gotlib&#x27;s death in 2016.

==The character==
Superdupont is the son of the Unknown Soldier buried under the Arc de Triomphe. He is caricaturally chauvinistic and gifted with superpowers that help him to defend his country against a secret terrorist organisation called &quot;Anti-France&quot;.

Anti-France agents are all foreigners and thus speak the fictional language &quot;Anti-Français&quot;, a mishmash of English, Spanish, Italian, Russian, and German.

The physical appearance of Superdupont is a superhero version of a caricatural Frenchman (specially, as seen by the Anglophone world): he wears a beret, a striped jersey, slippers, a tricolour belt held by a safety pin, a long blue cape. He also supports economic patriotism, as he smokes Gauloises cigarettes, drinks red wine, eats French cheese and refuses to be painted using China ink.

Like Superman, Superdupont is able to fly but seems less superpowered than Superman. Superdupont is a master at savate also known as boxe française (&quot;French boxing&quot;), which gives some superiority over his opponents.

<text>Bertram Harris Fields (March 31, 1929 – August 7, 2022) was an American lawyer noted for his work in the field of entertainment law. He represented many of the leading film studios, as well as numerous celebrities, and lectured at both Stanford and Harvard Law Schools. Fields was also a musician and an author of both fiction and non-fiction books.

==Early life and legal career==
Bertram Harris Fields was born on March 31, 1929, in Los Angeles, California, the only child of Mildred Arlyn Rubin, a former ballet dancer, and F. Maxwell Fields, an eye surgeon. His family was Jewish. 

He received his B.A. from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1949, and his LL.B. from Harvard Law School (&quot;magna cum laude&quot;) in 1952. He was a member of the California and New York Bars. Fields&#x27; notable clients included Michael Jackson, The Beatles, Warren Beatty, James Cameron, Mike Nichols, Joel Silver, Tom Cruise, Dustin Hoffman, Mario Puzo, and John Travolta.

Fields represented George Lucas in contract negotiations with The Walt Disney Company regarding Disney theme parks. He also represented Paramount Pictures in its appeal of the &quot;Buchwald v. Paramount&quot; case over &quot;Coming to America&quot;, and in other civil litigation. He represented Jeffrey Katzenberg in a landmark action against Disney, and also obtained a multimillion-dollar judgement for George Harrison against his former business manager. Representing DreamWorks SKG and Steven Spielberg, he defeated an application for an injunction against exhibition of &quot;Amistad&quot;.

Fields also represented Michael Jackson during contract talks with Sony Music, in the early 1990s and during the 1993 child molestation allegations made against Jackson.

Fields defended the Church of Scientology after many of its celebrity members, including Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and Chick Corea, were boycotted in Germany, where the religion is not legally recognized. He wrote an open letter to Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; comparing the boycotts to Nazi book burnings. 

Fields represented Bob and Harvey Weinstein through years of skirmishes between Miramax and its corporate owner, Disney, rarely making public statements until he arranged the brothers&#x27; departure, in 2005, without litigation.

In January 2008, Fields, representing Tom Cruise, stated that an unauthorized biography (by British author Andrew Morton) was full of &quot;tired old lies&quot; or &quot;sick stuff.&quot;

In June 2008, Drew Pinsky, in an interview for &quot;Playboy&quot;, mentioned his belief that for Tom Cruise to be &quot;drawn into a cultish kind of environment like Scientology,&quot; he was likely to have emotional problems. He said &quot;To me, that&#x27;s a function of a very deep emptiness and suggests serious neglect in childhood — maybe some abuse, but mostly neglect.&quot; Fields, representing Cruise, responded by calling Pinsky an &quot;unqualified television performer&quot; and likened him to Nazi Joseph Goebbels, saying, &quot;He seems to be spewing the absurdity that all Scientologists are mentally ill. The last time we heard garbage like this was from Joseph Goebbels.&quot; 

Pinsky, a licensed physician of Jewish ancestry, responded through his representative, &quot;Dr. Drew meant no harm to Mr. Cruise and apologizes if his comments were hurtful.&quot; The statement continued, &quot;Although Mr. Fields&#x27;s intent is clearly to slander and discredit Dr. Drew, under no circumstances is Dr. Drew making a blanket diagnosis about Scientology nor Mr. Cruise whom he does not know. Dr. Drew was simply using Mr. Cruise as an example of someone who is recognizable to help the public understand. Again, Dr. Drew meant him no harm.&quot;
On March 13, 2012, Fields, attorney for the estate of Mario Puzo, filed a counterclaim against Paramount Pictures, who sued the estate to stop the author&#x27;s son, Anthony Puzo, from publishing a new sequel to his father&#x27;s classic Mafia saga, &quot;The Godfather.&quot; Fields was quoted as saying, &quot;Mario Puzo brought vast wealth to Paramount at a time when they desperately needed it. Now that he&#x27;s gone, Paramount&#x27;s trying to deprive his children of the rights he specifically reserved. I promised Mario I&#x27;d protect his kids from this kind of reprehensible conduct. Paramount wanted a war, and they&#x27;re going to get one.&quot;

In April 2014, Harvard Law School announced that Fields made a gift of $5 million to endow the Bertram Fields Professorship of Law.

Fields continued to represent Bob Weinstein, who was accused of sexual harassment on October 17, 2017, by &quot;The Mist&quot; film producer Amanda Segel, who worked for Weinstein&#x27;s Dimension Films. Fields denied the accusations, stating that &quot;It is absolutely not true&quot; and &quot;What she is claiming is bogus&quot; and that &quot;There was nothing that came anywhere near sexual harassment&quot;. He further stated that &quot;That&#x27;s not Bob Weinstein. It&#x27;s Harvey Weinstein, but it sure as hell isn&#x27;t Bob Weinstein. I&#x27;ve known him for many years. It&#x27;s all because of what Harvey&#x27;s done&quot;.&quot; Fields and other attorneys from Greenberg Glusker represented The Weinstein Company from 2005 to December 2017 when it dropped them as a client over unpaid bills.

===&quot;Summing Up: A Professional Memoir&quot;===
In 2021, Fields published &quot;Summing Up: A Professional Memoir&quot; (), recounting his long career as an attorney. His insider&#x27;s look into the world of the famous is sometimes artfully revealing. For example, Fields was already one of Michael Jackson&#x27;s lawyers when the singer was accused of sexually abusing a child; he resigned due to what he saw as Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s interference. (In the book he says that he remains convinced that Jackson was innocent of the charges, however.) Other tales are much lighter in tone; for instance, Gore Vidal turned to Fields when a movie studio refused to credit his work on the screenplay for the 1987 film &quot;The Sicilian&quot;. Fields won his case, but then Vidal, after seeing the movie, exclaimed, &quot;Keep my name off that piece of s***!&quot;

===Novels and historical writing===

In 2018, Fields published &quot;Gloriana: Exploring The Reign Of Elizabeth I&quot;. () Elizabeth I, aka the Virgin Queen, was a colorful figure who still manages to stimulate the popular imagination more than 400 years after her death. Fields&#x27; wide-ranging biography spans the entire Tudor dynasty, with Elizabeth&#x27;s rise to power, her completion of England&#x27;s break from the Roman Catholic Church, the war with Spain, and her constantly evolving entourage of advisers, favorites, and paramours. Fields delves into the curios of Elizabeth&#x27;s life. Was she truly a virgin? Did she sanction the murder of the wife of nobleman Robert Dudley? What were her true thoughts on Roman Catholicism?

Fields introduces readers to aspects of the queen that they may not have heard before. He finds plenty of intrigues to challenge conventional notions of the queen. Beautiful, full-color portraits from the National Portrait Gallery in London and a timeline of the queen&#x27;s life round out this volume. Its 450-plus pages belie what a quick read it actually is, making it a perfect primer for those interested in the Good Queen Bess.

In September 2015, Fields published &quot;Shylock: His Own Story&quot; (). In &quot;The Merchant Of Venice&quot; Shakespeare gives us only a brief and limited view of Shylock, an enigmatic character who varies with each actor&#x27;s interpretation. Now, we&#x27;re given Shylock&#x27;s full story, his dangerous background, his life, loves and challenges as an educated Jew in 16th century Venice, the motivation for demanding his seemingly bizarre &#x27;bond,&#x27; as well as what occurred after his fateful confrontation with Portia and the Doge. The novel was published by Marmont Lane. It is dedicated to Fields&#x27; friend, the actor Dustin Hoffman.

In 2015, Fields published &quot;Destiny: A Novel Of Napoleon &amp; Josephine&quot;. () This historical novel tells the story of the Emperor and his beautiful Creole lover. The novel was published by Marmont Lane.

In 2011, Fields was awarded the Crystal Quill Award by the Shakespeare Center Of Los Angeles for his work on William Shakespeare. In 2005, he published the non-fiction book &quot;Players: The Mysterious Identity of William Shakespeare&quot;, which deals with the authorship of the plays and sonnets of William Shakespeare.

Having read English history for years as a hobby, and not satisfied with the books written about King Richard III, Fields spent four years researching and two years writing the non-fiction book &quot;Royal Blood: Richard III and the Mystery of the Princes&quot; (), which was published in 1998.

Although he started with a &quot;gut feeling&quot; that Richard was innocent of murdering his nephews, the Princes in the Tower; Fields claimed to have investigated the facts as he would have for a client he was representing, and he structured the book like a lawyer&#x27;s brief, identifying the evidence and then drew the logical implications from the facts. In the same way as in a brief, he discussed the weaknesses in earlier authors&#x27; treatments of the same subject, being particularly critical of Alison Weir and her book &quot;The Princes in the Tower&quot;.

The conclusion Fields reached is that the probability that the princes were, in fact, murdered is about 50% to 70%, and if they were, the probability that Richard did it is in the same range, so the logical probability that Richard is guilty is 25% to 49%, which is less than 50-50. Fields says DNA analyses of the bones dug up in the Tower of London in 1674 would change the odds on whether the princes were murdered but might not affect the odds on who did it, if anyone did, so this mystery may never be solved.

Fields penned two novels, published under the pseudonym &quot;D. Kincaid&quot;: &quot;The Sunset Bomber&quot; (1986, published by Corgi Books in London) which was also published under the name &quot;Final Verdict&quot; (1988), and &quot;The Lawyer&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1993).

===Open letter to the German chancellor===
In 1997, Fields conceived an open letter to then-German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, published as a newspaper advertisement in the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, which drew parallels between the &quot;organized oppression&quot; of Scientologists in Germany and Nazi policies espoused by Germany in the 1930s. The letter was signed by 34 prominent figures in the U.S. entertainment industry, including the top executives of MGM, Warner Bros., Paramount, Universal, and Sony Pictures Entertainment as well as actors Dustin Hoffman and Goldie Hawn, director Oliver Stone, writers Mario Puzo and Gore Vidal, and talk-show host Larry King.

===As a teacher===
Fields taught at Stanford Law School and lectured annually at Harvard Law School.

=== Musician ===
A serious music enthusiast, Fields performed with his good friend and client George Harrison. He performed and recorded professionally as a singer and vibraphonist with Les Deux Love Orchestra, led by Bobby Woods.

Celebrating his 92nd birthday, he released his first single, a cover of the Gene Autry classic, &quot;Back In The Saddle.&quot;

===Actor===
In 1967, Fields portrayed prosecutor &quot;Hal Davies&quot; on an episode of &quot;Dragnet&quot;. Fields was the real-life lawyer for the show&#x27;s creator and lead actor, Jack Webb.

== Personal life ==
Fields was noted as having &quot;cultivated a dapper and urbane image, based in part on his fondness for English tailoring and English history&quot;, according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

He married three times. After graduating from law school, Fields married his college sweetheart, Amy Markson, with whom he had one son, James Elder Fields (born 1955). In 1960, he married fashion model Lydia Minevitch (daughter of musician Borrah Minevitch) whose divorce he had handled two years prior. She died of lung cancer in 1986, after 27 years of marriage. He met his third wife, art expert Barbara Guggenheim, after she hired him to defend her when, in 1989, she was sued by Sylvester Stallone; they married in 1991.

Fields was survived by his son, James, and two grandchildren, Michael Lane Fields, and Annabelle Fields.

== Death ==
Fields died at his home in Malibu, California, from complications of Long COVID on August 7, 2022, at age 93.

He was buried at a private service at Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park and Mortuary in Los Angeles.

== Memorial ==
On October 2, 2022, a memorial was held for Bert Fields at The Eli and Edythe Broad Stage at the Santa Monica College Performing Arts Center. Speakers included Tom Cruise, Rich Eisen, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Susan Estrich, Dustin Hoffman and his daughter Ali Hoffman, Michael Ovitz, Elaine May, members of his family, and his wife, Barbara Guggenheim.

Walt Disney Studios case, in which Fields won a preliminary $200 million judgment but was forced to disqualify himself before the matter was heard at trial. The case was ruled in Disney&#x27;s favor 18 years after it was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, with aspects of it having gone to the U.S. Supreme Court. Fields&#x27; role in some of the key hearings is explored at length. According to the plaintiffs, Fields&#x27; fee (divided among many attorneys) reached $1 million a month before his recusal.

<doc id="87842" wikidata="Q126947" url="?curid=87842" title="Hardanger embroidery">
<text>Hardanger embroidery or &quot;Hardangersøm&quot; is a form of embroidery traditionally worked with white thread on white even-weave linen or cloth, using counted thread and drawn thread work techniques. It is sometimes called whitework embroidery.
Hardanger embroidery gets its name from the district of Hardanger in western Norway, where it was known simply as &quot;hvitsøm&quot; (whitework). Traditionally, this geometric embroidery and cutwork technique was worked in white linen thread on handwoven white linen fabric and used only as trim on garments.

==History==
In the period between 1650-1850 Hardangersom (meaning: &quot;work from Hardanger area&quot;) flourished in Norway. Flax was grown, carded, spun and woven into white fabric and thread which was used to make and decorate traditional Norwegian costume items called bunads (national costumes) as well as other items of clothing and household linens such as mats, curtains and bedspreads.

Hardanger is used on the bunad from the Hardanger region of Norway. It is usually found on the cuffs, collar and front yoke of the shirt, on the apron, and sometimes on a band around the pleated headdress.

==Materials and technique==

===Fabric===
Historically, Hardanger employed linen evenweave fabric of 36 count or higher. Modern Hardanger fabric is an evenweave cotton material woven with pairs of threads, typically 22 pairs per linear inch in both directions, referred to as &#x27;22-count&#x27;. The weave gives a squared appearance to the fabric (similar to Aida cloth), with distinct holes, making it easy to count and work on. There is no requirement to stitch on so-called Hardanger fabric: any evenweave linen, cotton or synthetic fabric of any count can be used.

===Threads===
Traditional Hardanger embroidery is worked with linen thread colour that matches the fabric, usually white or cream. Using self-coloured thread enhances both the sculptural nature of the stitches and the details in the intricate filling stitches.

Modern Hardanger can employ a large variety of threads. Two weights of Pearl (perlé) cotton are generally used. On 22-count Hardanger fabric this is usually Pearl cotton #5, a heavier weight used for satin stitch Kloster blocks and motifs, and Pearl cotton #8, a thinner thread used for more delicate filling stitches and other surface details. On finer, higher count fabrics the combination of #8 and #12 threads is often more suitable. Many contemporary designs, however, do make use of coloured, variegated and overdyed threads to great effect.

===Stitches and techniques===
Hardanger embroidery uses satin stitch blocks known as Kloster blocks, consisting of 5 parallel satin stitches, worked over a group of 4 x 4 ground threads. These blocks enclose areas of fabric where a number of warp and weft threads are cut and withdrawn, leaving a network of loose threads and large holes within the shape defined by the Kloster blocks. Various decorative filling stitches are then worked over the remaining loose threads and holes to create a lacy effect.

Some of the stitches and special techniques used are:
* Simple satin stitch surface motifs, often resembling stars, ships, crescents and crosses.
* Other decorative surface stitches such as fly stitch, running stitch, cable stitch and French knots.
* Woven bars: weaving the needle over and under four threads until they are completely covered, and wrapped bars (overcast bars) where the thread is wound around groups of four threads.
* Filling stitches resembling wheels, spider&#x27;s webs and dove&#x27;s eyes.
* Picot: twisting the thread once round the needle before inserting the needle to produce a decorative loop.
* Edging stitches such as four-sided stitch, buttonhole stitch and fancy hemstitching techniques for finishing items.

===Designs===
The traditional style of Hardanger work is very geometrical in form and based on several basic shapes such as squares, rectangles, triangles, diamonds, hearts, zig-zags and crosses. The combination and placement of these elements allow an unlimited number of beautiful patterns of all sizes to be created.

A wide range of patterns are available today for the modern needleworker to try, in both traditional and contemporary styles. Hardanger is still used to decorate cushions, table linen and other household items as well as items for display on a wall. Several modern needlework designers have incorporated elements of Hardanger cut work into their embroidery designs and samplers, often combining them with other needlework techniques, stitches, speciality threads and other embellishments to great effect.

===New uses===

Some Lutheran pastors of Norwegian descent in the United States have had stoles embroidered with Hardanger work made for their use. While altar paraments in Hardanger work have been traditional in Norwegian churches for a long time, their use in American Lutheran churches is becoming more common as an alternative to the more traditional machine-embroidered damask paraments. Even the traditional alternating cross and chalice motif of Norwegian Hardanger work is now found in American Lutheran churches.

<text>Shalmaneser III (&quot;Šulmānu-ašarēdu&quot;, &quot;the god Shulmanu is pre-eminent&quot;) was king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire from 859 BC to 824 BC.

His long reign was a constant series of campaigns against the eastern tribes, the Babylonians, the nations of Mesopotamia, Syria, as well as Kizzuwadna and Urartu. His armies penetrated to Lake Van and the Taurus Mountains; the Neo-Hittites of Carchemish were compelled to pay tribute, and the kingdoms of Hamath and Aram Damascus were subdued. It is in the annals of Shalmaneser III from the 850s BC that the Arabs and Chaldeans first appear in recorded history.

==Reign==

===Campaigns===
Shalmaneser began a campaign against Urartu and reported that in 858 BCE, he destroyed the city of Sugunia, and then in 853 BCE Araškun. Both cities are assumed to have been capitals of Urartu before Tushpa became a center for the Urartians. In 853 BC, a coalition was formed by eleven states, mainly by Hadadezer, King of Aram-Damascus; Irhuleni, king of Hamath; Ahab, king of Northern Israel; Gindibu, king of the Arabs; and some other rulers who fought the Assyrian king at the Battle of Qarqar. The result of the battle was not decisive, and Shalmaneser III had to fight his enemies several times again in the coming years, which eventually resulted in the occupation of the Levant, Jordan, and the Syrian Desert by the Assyrian Empire.

In 851 BC, following a rebellion in Babylon, Shalmaneser led a campaign against Marduk-bēl-ušate, younger brother of the king, Marduk-zakir-shumi I, who was an ally of Shalmaneser. In the second year of the campaign, Marduk-bēl-ušate was forced to retreat and was killed. A record of these events was made on the Black Obelisk:

===Against Israel===
In 841 BC, Shalmaneser campaigned against Hadadezer&#x27;s successor Hazael, forcing him to take refuge within the walls of his capital. While Shalmaneser was unable to capture Damascus, he devastated its territory, and Jehu of Israel (whose ambassadors are represented on the Black Obelisk now in the British Museum), together with the Phoenician cities, prudently sent tribute to him in perhaps 841 BC. Babylonia had already been conquered, including the areas occupied by migrant Chaldaean, Sutean and Aramean tribes, and the Babylonian king had been put to death.

===Against Tibareni===
In 836 BC, Shalmaneser sent an expedition against the Tibareni (Tabal) which was followed by one against Cappadocia, and in 832 BC came another campaign against Urartu. In the following year, age required the king to hand over the command of his armies to the Tartan (&quot;turtānu&quot; commander-in-chief) Dayyan-Assur, and six years later, Nineveh and other cities revolted against him under his rebel son Assur-danin-pal. Civil war continued for two years; but the rebellion was at last crushed by Shamshi-Adad V, another son of Shalmaneser. Shalmaneser died soon afterwards.

===Later campaigns===

Despite the rebellion later in his reign, Shalmanesar had proven capable of expanding the frontiers of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, stabilising its hold over the Khabur and mountainous frontier region of the Zagros, contested with Urartu.

==In Biblical studies==
His reign is significant to Biblical studies because two of his monuments name rulers from the Hebrew Bible. The Black Obelisk names Jehu son of Omri (although Jehu was misidentified as a son of Omri). The Kurkh Monolith names king Ahab, in reference to the Battle of Qarqar.

==Construction and the Black Obelisk==
He had built a palace at Kalhu (Biblical Calah, modern Nimrud), and left several editions of the royal annals recording his military campaigns, the last of which is engraved on the Black Obelisk from Calah.

The Black Obelisk is a significant artifact from his reign. It is a black limestone, bas-relief sculpture from Nimrud (ancient Kalhu), in northern Iraq. It is the most complete Assyrian obelisk yet discovered, and is historically significant because it displays the earliest ancient depiction of an Israelite. On the top and the bottom of the reliefs there is a long cuneiform inscription recording the annals of Shalmaneser III. It lists the military campaigns which the king and his commander-in-chief headed every year, until the thirty-first year of reign. Some features might suggest that the work had been commissioned by the commander-in-chief, Dayyan-Assur.

The second register from the top includes the earliest surviving picture of an Israelite: the Biblical Jehu, king of Israel. Jehu severed Israel&#x27;s alliances with Phoenicia and Judah, and became subject to Assyria. It describes how Jehu brought or sent his tribute in or around 841 BC. The caption above the scene, written in Assyrian cuneiform, can be translated:

&quot;The tribute of Jehu, son of Omri: I received from him silver, gold, a golden bowl, a golden vase with pointed bottom, golden tumblers, golden buckets, tin, a staff for a king [and] spears.&quot;

It was erected as a public monument in 825 BC at a time of civil war. It was discovered by archaeologist Sir Austen Henry Layard in 1846.

<text>Shalmaneser IV (Neo-Assyrian cuneiform: , meaning &quot;Salmānu is foremost&quot;) was the king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire from 783 BC to his death in 773 BC. Shalmaneser was the son and successor of his predecessor, Adad-nirari III, and ruled during a period of Assyrian decline from which few sources survive. As such his reign, other than broad political developments, is poorly known. Shalmaneser&#x27;s time was marked both by an increase in the power held by Assyrian officials relative to that of the king and Assyria&#x27;s enemies growing increasingly powerful. Most of Shalmaneser&#x27;s military efforts were spent warring against the Kingdom of Urartu in the north, which during this time was reaching the peak of its power.

== Biography ==

Shalmaneser IV was the son and successor of Adad-nirari III (811–783 BC), inheriting the throne upon his father&#x27;s death in 783 BC. The accession of Shalmaneser IV marks the beginning of an obscure period in Assyrian history, from which little information survives. This period also extends throughout the reigns of his two immediate successors, his brothers Ashur-dan III (773–755 BC) and Ashur-nirari V (755–745/744 BC). By the end of Adad-nirari III&#x27;s reign, the Neo-Assyrian Empire was declining. In particular, the power of the king himself was being threatened due to the emergence of extraordinarily powerful officials, whom while they accepted the authority of the Assyrian monarch in practice acted with supreme authority themselves and began to issue their own inscriptions, similar to those of the kings. This arrangement continued during the reign of Shalmaneser and his immediate successors, a time from which inscriptions from such officials are more common than inscriptions by the kings themselves. At the same time, the enemies of Assyria grew stronger and more serious. This period of Assyrian decline for instance coincided with the peak of the northern Kingdom of Urartu.

Only a small number of texts are known from Shalmaneser. No building projects are known from his time, though he is thought to have done some construction work in Assur, the first capital of Assyria. One inscription found near the city Marash in Turkey from 773 BC describes a border confirmation with Ušpilulume, king of Kummuh, made at some point after the conclusion of a campaign against Damascus. The inscription credits the influential general Shamshi-ilu with victory against Damascus and is ambiguous concerning whether it was Shamshu-ilu or Shalmaneser who negotiated with Ušpilulume. At Tell Abta, an archaeological site by Lake Tharthar, a stele has been found, written by the palace herald Bel-harran-beli-usur which describes the foundation of a new city in the desert. The stele unusually gives Bel-harran-beli-usur&#x27;s name before the name of the incumbent king and also credits the foundation of the new city to him, not to Shalmaneser, indicating great autonomy. Even more curiously, the inscription of the stele, which named the incumbent king as Shalmaneser, was at some point changed to instead refer to the later Tiglath-Pileser III (745–727 BC).

Shalmaneser&#x27;s queen was named Hama. They were married already during the reign of Adad-nirari, as an inscription by Adad-nirari identifies her as his daughter-in-law. Hama&#x27;s tomb was identified in 2017 by Tracy L. Spurrier at Nimrud, the capital in Shalmaneser&#x27;s time. Her skeleton indicates that she died very young, aged only 18–20, at some point during Shalmaneser&#x27;s reign, though the cause of death could not be determined. Buried alongside her were various treasures, including a golden crown, jewelry, gems, gold bowls, bracelets, rings, brooches, pots, stamps, caps, leaves, cups and cylinder seals.

Inscriptions from after Shalmaneser&#x27;s reign that mention him include the &quot;Assyrian King List&quot; (from which the length of his reign is known), a later royal decree, and a later list of eponyms (year names) that include the eponyms of Shalmaneser&#x27;s reign. From the list of eponyms, it is known that Shalmaneser campaigned against Urartu from 781 to 776 BC. It is possible that a letter written to the god of Assyria, Ashur, from a king in the obscure time initiated by Shalmaneser IV refers to this campaign but it might alternatively have been written in the reign of his successor. Other campaigns of Shalmaneser recorded in the eponyms include a campaign against Ituʾa, probably a Babylonian city, in 776 BC, a 775 BC campaign to &quot;the cedar mountain&quot;, a 774 BC campaign to Namri (in Urartu), and a final 774 BC campaign to Damascus. Though it appears that Shalmaneser&#x27;s wars against Urartu were not decisive, his western campaigns, such as those against Damascus and presumably the cedar mountain, as well as the border confirmation with Ušpilulume illustrate some success in the west. It is probable that some, or perhaps even all, of the campaigns were actually led by Shamshi-ilu, rather than the king. Shalmaneser died in 773 BC and was succeeded by his brother, Ashur-dan III.

<text>The stoat (Mustela erminea), also known as the Eurasian ermine or ermine, is a species of mustelid native to Eurasia and the northern regions of North America. Because of its wide circumpolar distribution, it is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.
The name ermine () is used especially in its pure white winter coat of the stoat or its fur. Ermine fur was used in the 15th century by Catholic monarchs, who sometimes used it as the mozzetta cape. It has long been used on the ceremonial robes of members of the United Kingdom House of Lords. It was also used in capes on images such as the Infant Jesus of Prague.

The stoat was introduced into New Zealand in the late 19th century to control rabbits, but had a devastating effect on native bird populations and was nominated as one of the world&#x27;s top 100 &quot;worst invaders&quot;.

==Etymology==

The root word for &quot;stoat&quot; is likely either the Dutch word (&quot;bold&quot;) or the Gothic word (, &quot;to push&quot;). According to John Guillim, in his &quot;Display of Heraldrie&quot;, the word &quot;ermine&quot; is likely derived from Armenia, the nation where it was thought the species originated, though other authors have linked it to the Norman French from the Teutonic (Anglo-Saxon ). This seems to come from the Lithuanian word . In Ireland (where the least weasel does not occur), the stoat is referred to as a weasel, while in North America it is called a short-tailed weasel. A male stoat is called a &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;hob&quot;, or &quot;jack&quot;, while a female is called a &quot;jill&quot;. The collective noun for stoats is either &quot;gang&quot; or &quot;pack&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
Formerly considered a single species with a very wide circumpolar range, a 2021 study split &quot;M. erminea&quot; into three species: &quot;M. erminea sensu stricto&quot; (Eurasia and northern North America), &quot;M. richardsonii&quot; (most of North America), and &quot;M. haidarum&quot; (several islands off the Pacific Northwest coast).

===Subspecies===
, 21 subspecies are recognized.

==Evolution==
The stoat&#x27;s direct ancestor was &quot;Mustela palerminea&quot;, a common carnivore in central and eastern Europe during the Middle Pleistocene, that spread to North America during the late Blancan or early Irvingtonian. The stoat is the product of a process that began 5–7 million years ago, when northern forests were replaced by open grassland, thus prompting an explosive evolution of small, burrowing rodents. The stoat&#x27;s ancestors were larger than the current form, and underwent a reduction in size as they exploited the new food source. The stoat first arose in Eurasia, shortly after the long-tailed weasel, which is in a different genus (&quot;Neogale&quot;), arose as its mirror image in North America 2 million years ago. The stoat thrived during the Ice Age, as its small size and long body allowed it to easily operate beneath snow, as well as hunt in burrows. The stoat and the long-tailed weasel remained separated until 500,000 years ago, when falling sea levels exposed the Bering land bridge.

Fossilised stoat remains have been recovered from Denisova Cave. Combined phylogenetic analyses indicate the stoat&#x27;s closest living relatives are the American ermine (&quot;M. richardsonii&quot;) and Haida ermine (&quot;M. haidarum&quot;), the latter of which partially descends from &quot;M. erminea&quot;. It is basal to most other members of &quot;Mustela&quot;, with only the yellow-bellied (&quot;M. kathia&quot;), Malayan (&quot;M. katiah&quot;), and back-striped (&quot;M. strigidorsa&quot;) weasels being more basal. The mountain weasel (&quot;Mustela altaica&quot;) was formerly considered its closest relative although more recent analyses have found it to be significantly more derived. It was also previously thought to be allied with members of the genus &quot;Neogale&quot; such as the long-tailed weasel, but as those species have since been separated into a new genus, this is likely not the case.

==Description==
===Build===

The stoat is similar to the least weasel in general proportions, manner of posture, and movement, though the tail is relatively longer, always exceeding a third of the body length, though it is shorter than that of the long-tailed weasel. The stoat has an elongated neck, the head being set exceptionally far in front of the shoulders. The trunk is nearly cylindrical, and does not bulge at the abdomen. The greatest circumference of body is little
more than half its length. The skull, although very similar to that of the least weasel, is relatively longer, with a narrower braincase. The projections of the skull and teeth are weakly developed, but stronger than those of the least weasel. The eyes are round, black and protrude slightly. The whiskers are brown or white in colour, and very long. The ears are short, rounded and lie almost flattened against the skull. The claws are not retractable, and are large in proportion to the digits. Each foot has five toes. The male stoat has a curved baculum with a proximal knob that increases in weight as it ages. Fat is deposited primarily along the spine and kidneys, then on gut mesenteries, under the limbs and around the shoulders. The stoat has four pairs of nipples, though they are visible only in females.
The dimensions of the stoat are variable, but not as significantly as the least weasel&#x27;s. Unusual among the Carnivora, the size of stoats tends to decrease proportionally with latitude, in contradiction to Bergmann&#x27;s rule. Sexual dimorphism in size is pronounced, with males being roughly 25% larger than females and 1.5-2.0 times their weight. On average, males measure in body length, while females measure . The tail measures in males and in females. In males, the hind foot measures , while in females it is . The height of the ear measures in males and . The skulls of males measure in length, while those of females measure . Males average in weight, while females weigh less than .

The stoat has large anal scent glands measuring in males and smaller in females. Scent glands are also present on the cheeks, belly and flanks. Epidermal secretions, which are deposited during body rubbing, are chemically distinct from the products of the anal scent glands, which contain a higher proportion of volatile chemicals. When attacked or being aggressive, the stoat secretes the contents of its anal glands, giving rise to a strong, musky odour produced by several sulphuric compounds. The odour is distinct from that of least weasels.

===Fur===

The winter fur is very dense and silky, but quite closely lying and short, while the summer fur is rougher, shorter and sparse. In summer, the fur is sandy-brown on the back and head and a white below. The division between the dark back and the light belly is usually straight, though this trait is only present in 13.5% of Irish stoats. The stoat moults twice a year. In spring, the moult is slow, starting from the forehead, across the back, toward the belly. In autumn, the moult is quicker, progressing in the reverse direction. The moult, initiated by photoperiod, starts earlier in autumn and later in spring at higher latitudes. In the stoat&#x27;s northern range, it adopts a completely white coat (save for the black tail-tip) during the winter period. Differences in the winter and summer coats are less apparent in southern forms of the species. In the species&#x27; southern range, the coat remains brown, but is denser and sometimes paler than in summer.

==Distribution and habitat==
The stoat has a circumboreal range throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. The stoat in Europe is found as far south as 41ºN in Portugal, and inhabits most islands with the exception of Iceland, Svalbard, the Mediterranean islands and some small North Atlantic islands. In Japan, it is present in central mountains (northern and central Japanese Alps) to northern part of Honshu (primarily above 1,200 m) and Hokkaido. Its vertical range is from sea level to . In North America, it is found throughout Alaska and western Yukon to most of Arctic Canada east to Greenland. Throughout the rest of North America, as well as parts of Nunavut, including Baffin Island and some islands in southeast Alaska, it is replaced by &quot;M. richardsonii&quot;.

===Introduction to New Zealand===

Stoats were introduced into New Zealand during the late 19th century to control rabbits and hares, but are now a major threat to native bird populations. The introduction of stoats was opposed by scientists in New Zealand and Britain, including the New Zealand ornithologist Walter Buller. The warnings were ignored and stoats began to be introduced from Britain in the 1880s, resulting in a noticeable decline in bird populations within six years. Stoats are a serious threat to ground- and hole-nesting birds, since the latter have very few means of escaping predation. The highest rates of stoat predation occur after seasonal gluts in southern beechmast (beechnuts), which enable the reproduction of rodents on which stoats also feed, enabling stoats to increase their own numbers. For instance, the endangered South Island takahē&#x27;s wild population dropped by a third between 2006 and 2007, after a stoat plague triggered by the 2005–06 mast wiped out more than half the takahē in untrapped areas.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Reproduction and development===

In the Northern Hemisphere, mating occurs in the April–July period. In spring, the male&#x27;s testes are enlarged, a process accompanied by an increase of testosterone concentration in the plasma. Spermatogenesis occurs in December, and the males are fertile from May to August, after which the testes regress. Female stoats are usually only in heat for a brief period, which is triggered by changes in day length. Copulation can last as long as 1 hour. Stoats are not monogamous, with litters often being of mixed paternity. Stoats undergo embryonic diapause, meaning that the embryo does not immediately implant in the uterus after fertilization, but rather lies dormant for a period of nine to ten months. The gestation period is therefore variable but typically around 300 days, and after mating in the summer, the offspring will not be born until the following spring – adult female stoats spend almost all their lives either pregnant or in heat. Females can reabsorb embryos and in the event of a severe winter they may reabsorb their entire litter. Males play no part in rearing the young, which are born blind, deaf, toothless and covered in fine white or pinkish down. The milk teeth erupt after three weeks, and solid food is eaten after four weeks. The eyes open after five to six weeks, with the black tail-tip appearing a week later. Lactation ends after 12 weeks. Prior to the age of five to seven weeks, kits have poor thermoregulation, so they huddle for warmth when the mother is absent. Males become sexually mature at 10–11 months, while females are sexually mature at the age of 2–3 weeks whilst still blind, deaf and hairless, and are usually mated with adult males before being weaned.

===Territorial and sheltering behaviour===

Stoat territoriality has a generally mustelid spacing pattern, with male territories encompassing smaller female territories, which they defend from other males. The size of the territory and the ranging behaviour of its occupants varies seasonally, depending on the abundance of food and mates. During the breeding season, the ranges of females remain unchanged, while males either become roamers, strayers or transients. Dominant older males have territories 50 times larger than those of younger, socially inferior males. Both sexes mark their territories with urine, feces and two types of scent marks; anal drags are meant to convey territorial occupancy, and body rubbing is associated with agonistic encounters.

The stoat does not dig its own burrows, instead using the burrows and nest chambers of the rodents it kills. The skins and underfur of rodent prey are used to line the nest chamber. The nest chamber is sometimes located in seemingly unsuitable places, such as among logs piled against the walls of houses. The stoat also inhabits old and rotting stumps, under tree roots, in heaps of brushwood, haystacks, in bog hummocks, in the cracks of vacant mud buildings, in rock piles, rock clefts, and even in magpie nests. Males and females typically live apart, but close to each other. Each stoat has several dens dispersed within its range. A single den has several galleries, mainly within of the surface.

===Diet===
As with the least weasel, mouse-like rodents predominate in the stoat&#x27;s diet. It regularly preys on larger rodent and lagomorph species, and takes individuals far larger than itself. In Russia, its prey includes rodents and lagomorphs such as European water voles, common hamsters, pikas and others, which it overpowers in their burrows. Prey species of secondary importance include small birds, fish, and shrews and, more rarely, amphibians, lizards, and insects. It also preys on lemmings.
In Great Britain, European rabbits are an important food source, with the frequency in which stoats prey on them having increased between the 1960s and mid 1990s since the end of the myxomatosis epidemic. Typically, male stoats prey on rabbits more frequently than females do, which depend to a greater extent on smaller rodent species. British stoats rarely kill shrews, rats, squirrels and water voles, though rats may be an important food source locally. In Ireland, shrews and rats are frequently eaten. In mainland Europe, water voles make up a large portion of the stoat&#x27;s diet. Hares are sometimes taken, but are usually young specimens. In New Zealand, the stoat feeds principally on birds, including the rare kiwi, kaka, mohua, yellow-crowned parakeet, and New Zealand dotterel. Cases are known of stoats preying on young muskrats. The stoat typically eats about of food a day, which is equivalent to 25% of the animal&#x27;s live weight.
The stoat is an opportunistic predator that moves rapidly and checks every available burrow or crevice for food. Because of their larger size, male stoats are less successful than females in pursuing rodents far into tunnels. Stoats regularly climb trees to gain access to birds&#x27; nests, and are common raiders of nest boxes, particularly those of large species. The stoat reputedly mesmerises prey such as rabbits by a &quot;dance&quot; (sometimes called the weasel war dance), though this behaviour could be linked to &quot;Skrjabingylus&quot; infections. The stoat seeks to immobilize large prey such as rabbits with a bite to the spine at the back of the neck. The stoat may surplus kill when the opportunity arises, though excess prey is usually cached and eaten later to avoid obesity, as overweight stoats tend to be at a disadvantage when pursuing prey into their burrows. Small prey typically die instantly from a bite to the back of the neck, while larger prey, such as rabbits, typically die of shock, as the stoat&#x27;s canine teeth are too short to reach the spinal column or major arteries.

===Communication===
The stoat is a usually silent animal, but can produce a range of sounds similar to those of the least weasel. Kits produce a fine chirping noise. Adults trill excitedly before mating, and indicate submission through quiet trilling, whining and squealing. When nervous, the stoat hisses, and will intersperse this with sharp barks or shrieks and prolonged screeching when aggressive.

Aggressive behavior in stoats is categorized in these forms:
* Noncontact approach, which is sometimes accompanied by a threat display and vocalization from the approached animal
* Forward thrust, accompanied by a sharp shriek, which is usually done by stoats defending a nest or retreat site
* Nest occupation, when a stoat appropriates the nesting site of a weaker individual
* Kleptoparasitism, in which a dominant stoat appropriates the killing of a weaker one, usually after a fight.

Submissive stoats express their status by avoiding higher-ranking animals, fleeing from them or making whining or squealing sounds.

===Predators===
Larger mammalian predators such as red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) and sables (&quot;Martes zibellina&quot;) are known to prey on stoats. Additionally, a wide range of birds of prey can take stoats, from small northern hawk-owls (&quot;Surnia ulula&quot;) and short-eared owls (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;) to various buzzards, kites, goshawks, and even Eurasian eagle-owls (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;) and golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;). Although not classified as birds of prey, grey herons (&quot;Ardea cinerea&quot;) are known to prey on stoats.

===Diseases and parasites===
Tuberculosis has been recorded in stoats inhabiting the former Soviet Union and New Zealand. They are largely resistant to tularemia, but are reputed to suffer from canine distemper in captivity. Symptoms of mange have also been recorded.

Stoats are vulnerable to ectoparasites associated with their prey and the nests of other animals on which they do not prey. The louse &quot;Trichodectes erminea&quot; is recorded in stoats living in Canada, Ireland and New Zealand. In continental Europe, 26 flea species are recorded to infest stoats, including &quot;Rhadinospylla pentacantha&quot;, &quot;Megabothris rectangulatus&quot;, &quot;Orchopeas howardi&quot;, &quot;Spilopsyllus ciniculus&quot;, &quot;Ctenophthalamus nobilis&quot;, &quot;Dasypsyllus gallinulae&quot;, &quot;Nosopsyllus fasciatus&quot;, &quot;Leptospylla segnis&quot;, &quot;Ceratophyllus gallinae&quot;, &quot;Parapsyllus n. nestoris&quot;, &quot;Amphipsylla kuznetzovi&quot; and &quot;Ctenopsyllus bidentatus&quot;. Tick species known to infest stoats are &quot;Ixodes canisuga&quot;, &quot;I. hexagonus&quot;, and &quot;I. ricinus&quot; and &quot;Haemaphysalis longicornis&quot;. Louse species known to infest stoats include &quot;Mysidea picae&quot; and &quot;Polyplax spinulosa&quot;. Mite species known to infest stoats include &quot;Neotrombicula autumnalis&quot;, &quot;Demodex erminae&quot;, &quot;Eulaelaps stabulans&quot;, &quot;Gymnolaelaps annectans&quot;, &quot;Hypoaspis nidicorva&quot;, and &quot;Listrophorus mustelae&quot;.

The nematode &quot;Skrjabingylus nasicola&quot; is particularly threatening to stoats, as it erodes the bones of the nasal sinuses and decreases fertility. Other nematode species known to infect stoats include &quot;Capillaria putorii&quot;, &quot;Molineus patens&quot; and &quot;Strongyloides martes&quot;. Cestode species known to infect stoats include &quot;Taenia tenuicollis&quot;, &quot;Mesocestoides lineatus&quot; and rarely &quot;Acanthocephala&quot;.

==In culture==
===Folklore and mythology===
In Irish mythology, stoats were viewed anthropomorphically as animals with families, which held rituals for their dead. They were also viewed as noxious animals prone to thieving, and their saliva was said to be able to poison a grown man. To encounter a stoat when setting out for a journey was considered bad luck, but one could avert this by greeting the stoat as a neighbour. Stoats were also supposed to hold the souls of infants who died before baptism. 

In the folklore of the Komi people of the Urals, stoats are symbolic of beautiful and coveted young women. In the Zoroastrian religion, the stoat is considered a sacred animal, as its white winter coat represented purity. Similarly, Mary Magdalene was depicted as wearing a white stoat pelt as a sign of her reformed character. 

One popular European legend had it that a white stoat would die before allowing its pure white coat to be besmirched. When it was being chased by hunters, it would supposedly turn around and give itself up to the hunters rather than risk soiling itself. 

The former nation (now region) of Brittany in France uses a stylized ermine-fur pattern in forming the coat of arms and flag of Brittany. Gilles Servat&#x27;s song &quot;La Blanche Hermine&quot; (&quot;The White Ermine&quot;) became an anthem for Bretons (and is popular among French people in general).

In the 16th century Chinese novel &quot;Investiture of the Gods&quot;, Erlang Shen transforms into an ermine to demonstrate his shapeshifting abilities.

===Fur use===
Stoat skins are prized by the fur trade, especially in winter coat, and used to trim coats and stoles. The fur from the winter coat is referred to as ermine and is the traditional ancient symbol of the Duchy of Brittany, forming its earliest flag. There is also a design called ermine inspired by the winter coat of the stoat and painted onto other furs, such as rabbit. In Europe these furs are a symbol of royalty and high status. The ceremonial robes of members of the United Kingdom House of Lords and the academic hoods of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge are traditionally trimmed with ermine. In practice, rabbit or fake fur is now often used due to expense or animal rights concerns. Prelates of the Catholic Church still wear ecclesiastical garments featuring ermine (a sign of their status equal to that of the nobility). Cecilia Gallerani is depicted holding an ermine in her portrait, &quot;Lady with an Ermine&quot;, by Leonardo da Vinci. Henry Peacham&#x27;s &quot;Emblem 75&quot;, which depicts an ermine being pursued by a hunter and two hounds, is entitled &quot;Cui candor morte redemptus&quot; (&quot;Purity Bought with His Own Death&quot;). Peacham goes on to preach that men and women should follow the example of the ermine and keep their minds and consciences as pure as the legendary ermine keeps its fur.

Ermine (both &quot;M. erminea&quot; and &quot;M. richardsonii&quot;, both of which inhabited the Tlingit&#x27;s territory) were also valued by the Tlingit and other indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. They could be attached to traditional regalia and cedar bark hats as status symbols, or they were also made into shirts.

The stoat was a fundamental item in the fur trade of the Soviet Union, with no less than half the global catch coming from within its borders. The Soviet Union also contained the highest grades of stoat pelts, with the best grade North American pelts being comparable only to the 9th grade in the quality criteria of former Soviet stoat standards. Stoat harvesting never became a specialty in any Soviet republic, with most stoats being captured incidentally in traps or near villages. Stoats in the Soviet Union were captured either with dogs or with box-traps or jaw-traps. Guns were rarely used, as they could damage the pelt.

<text>The transputer is a series of pioneering microprocessors from the 1980s, intended for parallel computing. To support this, each transputer had its own integrated memory and serial communication links to exchange data with other transputers. They were designed and produced by Inmos, a semiconductor company based in Bristol, United Kingdom.

For some time in the late 1980s, many considered the transputer to be the next great design for the future of computing. While the transputer did not achieve this expectation, the transputer architecture was highly influential in provoking new ideas in computer architecture, several of which have re-emerged in different forms in modern systems.

== Background ==
In the early 1980s, conventional central processing units (CPUs) appeared to have reached a performance limit. Up to that time, manufacturing difficulties limited the amount of circuitry that could fit on a chip. Continued improvements in the fabrication process had largely removed this restriction. Within a decade, chips could hold more circuitry than the designers knew how to use. Traditional complex instruction set computer (CISC) designs were reaching a performance plateau, and it wasn&#x27;t clear it could be overcome.

It seemed that the only way forward was to increase the use of parallelism, the use of several CPUs that would work together to solve several tasks at the same time. This depended on such machines being able to run several tasks at once, a process termed multitasking. This had generally been too difficult for prior microprocessor designs to handle, but more recent designs were able to accomplish it effectively. It was clear that in the future, this would be a feature of all operating systems (OSs).

A side effect of most multitasking design is that it often also allows the processes to be run on physically different CPUs, in which case it is termed multiprocessing. A low-cost CPU built for multiprocessing could allow the speed of a machine to be raised by adding more CPUs, potentially far more cheaply than by using one faster CPU design.

The first transputer designs were due to computer scientist David May and telecommunications consultant Robert Milne. In 1990, May received an Honorary DSc from University of Southampton, followed in 1991 by his election as a Fellow of The Royal Society and the award of the Patterson Medal of the Institute of Physics in 1992. Tony Fuge, then a leading engineer at Inmos, was awarded the Prince Philip Designers Prize in 1987 for his work on the T414 transputer.

== Design ==
The transputer was the first general purpose microprocessor designed specifically to be used in parallel computing systems. The goal was to produce a family of chips ranging in power and cost that could be wired together to form a complete parallel computer. The name, from &quot;&quot;trans&quot;istor&quot; and &quot;com&quot;puter&quot;&quot;, was selected to indicate the role the individual transputers would play: numbers of them would be used as basic building blocks in a larger integrated system, just as transistors had been used in earlier designs.

Originally the plan was to make the transputer cost only a few dollars per unit. Inmos saw them being used for practically everything, from operating as the main CPU for a computer to acting as a channel controller for disk drives in the same machine. In a traditional machine, the processing capability of a disk controller, for instance, would be idle when the disk was not being accessed. In contrast, in a transputer system, spare cycles on any of these transputers could be used for other tasks, greatly increasing the overall performance of the machines.

The transputer had large on-chip memory, making it essentially a processor-in-memory. Even one transputer would have all the circuitry needed to work by itself, a feature more commonly associated with microcontrollers. The intent was to allow transputers to be connected together as easily as possible, with no need for a complex bus, or motherboard. Power and a simple clock signal had to be supplied, but little else: random-access memory (RAM), a RAM controller, bus support and even a real-time operating system (RTOS) were all built in. In this way, the last of the transputers were single Reusable Micro Cores (RMC) in the then emerging SoC market.

=== Architecture ===
The original transputer used a very simple and rather unusual architecture to achieve a high performance in a small area. It used microcode as the main method to control the data path, but unlike other designs of the time, many instructions took only one cycle to execute. Instruction opcodes were used as the entry points to the microcode read-only memory (ROM) and the outputs from the ROM were fed directly to the data path. For multi-cycle instructions, while the data path was performing the first cycle, the microcode decoded four possible options for the second cycle. The decision as to which of these options would actually be used could be made near the end of the first cycle. This allowed for very fast operation while keeping the architecture generic.

The clock rate of 20 MHz was quite high for the era and the designers were very concerned about the practicality of distributing such a fast clock signal on a board. A slower external clock of 5 MHz was used, and this was multiplied up to the needed internal frequency using a phase-locked loop (PLL). The internal clock actually had four non-overlapping phases and designers were free to use whichever combination of these they wanted, so it could be argued that the transputer actually ran at 80 MHz. Dynamic logic was used in many parts of the design to reduce area and increase speed. Unfortunately, these methods are difficult to combine with automatic test pattern generation scan testing so they fell out of favour for later designs.

Prentice-Hall published a book on the general principles of the transputer.

=== Links ===
The basic design of the transputer included serial links known as &quot;os-link&quot;s that allowed it to communicate with up to four other transputers, each at 5, 10, or 20 Mbit/s – which was very fast for the 1980s. Any number of transputers could be connected together over links (which could run tens of metres) to form one computing &quot;farm&quot;. A hypothetical desktop machine might have two of the &quot;low end&quot; transputers handling input/output (I/O) tasks on some of their serial lines (hooked up to appropriate hardware) while they talked to one of their larger cousins acting as a CPU on another.

There were limits to the size of a system that could be built in this fashion. Since each transputer was linked to another in a fixed point-to-point layout, sending messages to a more distant transputer required that messages be relayed by each chip in the line. This introduced a delay with every &quot;hop&quot; over a link, leading to long delays on large nets. To solve this problem Inmos also provided a zero-delay switch that connected up to 32 transputers (or switches) into even larger networks.

=== Booting ===
Transputers could boot from memory, as is the case for most computers, but could also be booted over its network links. A special pin on the chips, BootFromROM, indicated which method it should use. If BootFromROM was asserted when the chip was reset, it would begin processing at the instruction two bytes from the top of memory, which was normally used to perform a backward jump into the boot code. If this pin was not asserted, the chip would instead wait for bytes to be received on any network link. The first byte to be received was the length of the code to follow. Following bytes were copied into low memory and then jumped into once that number of bytes had been received.

The general concept for the system was to have one transputer act as the central authority for booting a system containing a number of connected transputers. The selected transputer would have the BootFromROM permanently asserted, which would cause it to begin running a booter process from ROM on startup. The other transputers would have the BootFromROM tied low, and would simply wait. The loader would boot the central transputer, which would then begin sending boot code to the other transputers in the network, and could customize the code sent to each one, for instance, sending a device driver to the transputer connected to the hard drives.

The system also included the &#x27;special&#x27; code lengths of 0 and 1 which were reserved for PEEK and POKE. This allowed inspection and changing of RAM in an unbooted transputer. After a peek, followed by a memory address, or a poke, with an address and single word of data, the transputer would return to waiting for a bootstrap. This mechanism was generally used for debugging.

=== Scheduler ===
Added circuitry scheduled traffic over the links. Processes waiting for communications would automatically pause while the networking circuitry finished its reads or writes. Other processes running on the transputer would then be given that processing time. It included two priority levels to improve real-time and multiprocessor operation. The same logical system was used to communicate between programs running on one transputer, implemented as &quot;virtual network links&quot; in memory. So programs asking for any input or output automatically paused while the operation completed, a task that normally required an operating system to handle as the arbiter of hardware. Operating systems on the transputer did not need to handle scheduling; the chip could be considered to have an OS inside it.

=== Instruction set ===
To include all this function on one chip, the transputer&#x27;s core logic was simpler than most CPUs. While some have called it reduced instruction set computer (RISC) due to its rather sparse nature, and because that was then a desirable marketing buzzword, it was heavily microcoded, had a limited register set, and complex memory-to-memory instructions, all of which place it firmly in the CISC camp. Unlike register-heavy load/store RISC CPUs, the transputer had only three data registers, which behaved as a stack. In addition a workspace pointer pointed to a conventional memory stack, easily accessible via the instructions codice_1 and codice_2. This allowed for very fast context switching by simply changing the workspace pointer to the memory used by another process (a method used in a number of contemporary designs, such as the TMS9900). The three register stack contents were not preserved past certain instructions, like Jump, when the transputer could do a context switch.

The transputer instruction set consisted of 8-bit instructions assembled from opcode and operand nibbles. The &quot;upper&quot; nibble contained the 16 possible primary instruction codes, making it one of the very few commercialized minimal instruction set computers. The &quot;lower&quot; nibble contained the one immediate constant operand, commonly used as an offset relative to the workspace (memory stack) pointer. Two prefix instructions allowed construction of larger constants by prepending their lower nibbles to the operands of following instructions. Further instructions were supported via the instruction code &quot;Operate&quot; (codice_3), which decoded the constant operand as an extended zero-operand opcode, providing for almost endless and easy instruction set expansion as newer implementations of the transputer were introduced.

The 16 &#x27;primary&#x27; one-operand instructions were:

All these instructions take a constant, representing an offset or an arithmetic constant. If this constant was less than 16, all these instructions coded to one byte.

The first 16 &#x27;secondary&#x27; zero-operand instructions (using the OPR primary instruction) were:
=== Development ===

To provide an easy means of prototyping, constructing and configuring multiple-transputer systems, Inmos introduced the &quot;TRAM&quot; (TRAnsputer Module) standard in 1987. A TRAM was essentially a building block daughterboard comprising a transputer and, optionally, external memory and/or peripheral devices, with simple standardised connectors providing power, transputer links, clock and system signals. Various sizes of TRAM were defined, from the basic Size 1 TRAM (3.66 in by 1.05 in) up to Size 8 (3.66 in by 8.75 in). Inmos produced a range of TRAM motherboards for various host buses such as Industry Standard Architecture (ISA), MicroChannel, or VMEbus. TRAM links operate at 10 Mbit/s or 20 Mbit/s.

== Software ==
Transputers were intended to be programmed using the programming language occam, based on the communicating sequential processes (CSP) process calculus. The transputer was built to run Occam specifically, more than contemporary CISC designs were built to run languages like Pascal or C. Occam supported concurrency and channel-based inter-process or inter-processor communication as a fundamental part of the language. With the parallelism and communications built into the chip and the language interacting with it directly, writing code for things like device controllers became a triviality; even the most basic code could watch the serial ports for I/O, and would automatically sleep when there was no data.

The initial Occam development environment for the transputer was the Inmos D700 &quot;Transputer Development System&quot; (TDS). This was an unorthodox integrated development environment incorporating an editor, compiler, linker and (post-mortem) debugger. The TDS was a transputer application written in Occam. The TDS text editor was notable in that it was a folding editor, allowing blocks of code to be hidden and revealed, to make the structure of the code more apparent. Unfortunately, the combination of an unfamiliar programming language and equally unfamiliar development environment did nothing for the early popularity of the transputer. Later, Inmos would release more conventional Occam cross-compilers, the &quot;Occam 2 Toolsets&quot;.

Implementations of more mainstream programming languages, such as C, FORTRAN, Ada, Forth, and Pascal were also later released by both Inmos and third-party vendors. These usually included language extensions or libraries providing, in a less elegant way, Occam-like concurrency and channel-based communication.

The transputer&#x27;s lack of support for virtual memory inhibited the porting of mainstream variants of the Unix operating system, though ports of Unix-like operating systems (such as Minix and Idris from Whitesmiths) were produced. An advanced Unix-like distributed operating system, Helios, was also designed specifically for multi-transputer systems by Perihelion Software.

== Implementations ==
The first transputers were announced in 1983 and released in 1984.

In keeping with their role as microcontroller-like devices, they included on-board RAM and a built-in RAM controller which enabled more memory to be added with no added hardware. Unlike other designs, transputers did not include I/O lines: these were to be added with hardware attached to the existing serial links. There was one &#x27;Event&#x27; line, similar to a conventional processor&#x27;s interrupt line. Treated as a channel, a program could &#x27;input&#x27; from the event channel, and proceed only after the event line was asserted.

All transputers ran from an external 5 MHz clock input; this was multiplied to provide the processor clock.

The transputer did not include a memory management unit (MMU) or a virtual memory system.

Transputer variants (except the cancelled T9000) can be categorised into three groups: the 16-bit &quot;T2&quot; series, the 32-bit &quot;T4&quot; series, and the 32-bit &quot;T8&quot; series with 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point support.

=== T2: 16-bit ===
The prototype 16-bit transputer was the &quot;S43&quot;, which lacked the scheduler and DMA-controlled block transfer on the links. At launch, the &quot;T212&quot; and &quot;M212&quot; (the latter with an on-board disk controller) were the 16-bit offerings. The T212 was available in 17.5 and 20 MHz processor clock speed ratings. The T212 was superseded by the &quot;T222&quot;, with on-chip RAM expanded from 2 KB to 4 KB, and, later, the &quot;T225&quot;. This added debugging-breakpoint support (by extending the instruction &quot;&lt;samp&gt;J 0&lt;/samp&gt;&quot;) plus some extra instructions from the T800 instruction set. Both the T222 and T225 ran at 20 MHz.

=== T4: 32-bit ===
Launched in October 1985, the &quot;T414&quot; employed the equivalent of 900,000 transistors and was fabricated with a feature size. It was a 32-bit design, able to process 32-bit units of data and to address up to 4 GB of main memory. Originally, the first 32-bit variant was to be the &quot;T424&quot;, but fabrication difficulties meant that this was redesigned as the T414 with 2 KB on-board RAM instead of the intended 4 KB. The T414 was available in 15 and 20 MHz varieties. The RAM was later reinstated to 4 KB on the &quot;T425&quot; (in 20, 25, and 30 MHz varieties), which also added the &lt;samp&gt;J 0&lt;/samp&gt; breakpoint support and extra T800 instructions. The &quot;T400&quot;, released in September 1989, was a low-cost 20 MHz T425 derivative with 2 KB and two instead of four links, intended for the embedded systems market.

=== T8: floating point ===
The second-generation &quot;T800&quot; transputer, introduced in 1987, had an extended instruction set. The most important addition was a 64-bit floating-point unit (FPU) and three added registers for floating point, implementing the IEEE 754-1985 floating point standard. It also had 4 KB of on-board RAM and was available in 20 or 25 MHz versions. Breakpoint support was added in the later &quot;T801&quot; and &quot;T805&quot;, the former featuring separate address and data buses to improve performance. The T805 was also later available as a 30 MHz part.

An enhanced &quot;T810&quot; was planned, which would have had more RAM, more and faster links, extra instructions, and improved microcode, but this was cancelled around 1990.

Inmos also produced a variety of support chips for the transputer processors, such as the &quot;C004&quot; 32-way link switch and the &quot;C011&quot; and &quot;C012&quot; &quot;link adapters&quot; which allowed transputer links to be interfaced to an 8-bit data bus.

=== T400 ===
Part of the original Inmos strategy was to make CPUs so small and cheap that they could be combined with other logic in one device. Although a &quot;system on a chip&quot; (SoC) as they are commonly termed, are ubiquitous now, the concept was almost unheard of back in the early 1980s. Two projects were started in around 1983, the &quot;M212&quot; and the &quot;TV-toy&quot;. The M212 was based on a standard T212 core with the addition of a disk controller for the ST 506 and ST 412 Shugart standards. TV-toy was to be the basis for a video game console and was joint project between Inmos and Sinclair Research.

The links in the T212 and T414/T424 transputers had hardware DMA engines so that transfers could happen in parallel with execution of other processes. A variant of the design, termed the T400, not to be confused with a later transputer of the same name, was designed where the CPU handled these transfers. This reduced the size of the device considerably since 4 link engines were approximately the same size as the whole CPU. The T400 was intended to be used as a core in what were then called &quot;systems on silicon&quot; (SOS) devices, now termed and better known as &quot;system on a chip&quot; (SoC). It was this design that was to form part of TV-toy. The project was canceled in 1985.

=== T100 ===
Although the prior SoC projects had had only limited success (the M212 was sold for a time), many designers still firmly believed in the concept and in 1987, a new project, the T100 was started which combined an 8-bit version of the transputer CPU with configurable logic based on state machines. The transputer instruction set is based on 8-bit instructions and can easily be used with any word size which is a multiple of 8 bits. The target market for the T100 was to be bus controllers such as Futurebus, and an upgrade for the standard link adapters (C011 etc.). The project was stopped when the T840 (later to become the basis of the T9000) was started.

=== TPCORE ===
TPCORE is an implementation of the transputer, including the os-links, that runs in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA).

=== T9000 ===

Inmos improved on the performance of the T8 series transputers with the introduction of the &quot;T9000&quot; (code-named &quot;H1&quot; during development). The T9000 shared most features with the T800, but moved several pieces of the design into hardware and added several features for superscalar support. Unlike the earlier models, the T9000 had a true 16 KB high-speed cache (using random replacement) instead of RAM, but also allowed it to be used as memory and included MMU-like functionality to handle all of this (termed the &quot;PMI&quot;). For more speed the T9000 cached the top 32 locations of the stack, instead of three as in earlier versions.

The T9000 used a five-stage pipeline for even more speed. An interesting addition was the &quot;grouper&quot; which would collect instructions out of the cache and group them into larger packages of up to 8 bytes to feed the pipeline faster. Groups then completed in one cycle, as if they were single larger instructions working on a faster CPU.

The link system was upgraded to a new 100 MHz mode, but unlike the prior systems, the links were no longer downwardly compatible. This new packet-based link protocol was called &quot;DS-Link&quot;, and later formed the basis of the IEEE 1355 serial interconnect standard. The T9000 also added link routing hardware called the &quot;VCP&quot; (Virtual Channel Processor) which changed the links from point-to-point to a true network, allowing for the creation of any number of &quot;virtual channels&quot; on the links. This meant programs no longer had to be aware of the physical layout of the connections. A range of DS-Link support chips were also developed, including the &quot;C104&quot; 32-way crossbar switch, and the &quot;C101&quot; link adapter.

Long delays in the T9000&#x27;s development meant that the faster load/store designs were already outperforming it by the time it was to be released. It consistently failed to reach its own performance goal of beating the T800 by a factor of ten. When the project was finally cancelled it was still achieving only about 36 MIPS at 50 MHz. The production delays gave rise to the quip that the best host architecture for a T9000 was an overhead projector.

This was too much for Inmos, which did not have the funding needed to continue development. By this time, the company had been sold to SGS-Thomson (now STMicroelectronics), whose focus was the embedded systems market, and eventually the T9000 project was abandoned. However, a comprehensively redesigned 32-bit transputer intended for embedded applications, the &quot;ST20&quot; series, was later produced, using some technology developed for the T9000. The ST20 core was incorporated into chipsets for set-top box and Global Positioning System (GPS) applications.

=== ST20 ===
Although not strictly a transputer, the ST20 was heavily influenced by the T4 and T9 and formed the basis of the T450, which was arguably the last of the transputers. The mission of the ST20 was to be a reusable core in the then emerging SoC market. The original name of the ST20 was the Reusable Micro Core (RMC). The architecture was loosely based on the original T4 architecture with a microcode-controlled data path. However, it was a full redesign, using VHDL as the design language and with an optimized (and rewritten) microcode compiler. The project was conceived as early as 1990 when it was realized that the T9 would be too big for many applications. Actual design work started in mid-1992. Several trial designs were done, ranging from a very simple RISC-style CPU with complex instructions implemented in software via traps to a rather complex superscalar design similar in concept to the Tomasulo algorithm. The final design looked very similar to the original T4 core although some simple instruction grouping and a &quot;workspace cache&quot; were added to help with performance.

== Adoption ==

While the transputer was simple but powerful compared to many contemporary designs, it never came close to meeting its goal of being used universally in both CPU and microcontroller roles. In the microcontroller market, the market was dominated by 8-bit machines where cost was the most serious consideration. Here, even the T2s were too powerful and costly for most users.

In the computer desktop and workstation field, the transputer was fairly fast (operating at about 10 million instructions per second (MIPS) at 20 MHz). This was excellent performance for the early 1980s, but by the time the floating-point unit (FPU) equipped T800 was shipping, other RISC designs had surpassed it. This could have been mitigated to a large extent if machines had used multiple transputers as planned, but T800s cost about $400 each when introduced, which meant a poor price/performance ratio. Few transputer-based workstation systems were designed; the most notable likely being the Atari Transputer Workstation.

The transputer was more successful in the field of massively parallel computing, where several vendors produced transputer-based systems in the late 1980s. These included Meiko Scientific (founded by ex-Inmos employees), Floating Point Systems, Parsytec, and Parsys. Several British academic institutions founded research activities in the application of transputer-based parallel systems, including Bristol Polytechnic&#x27;s Bristol Transputer Centre and the University of Edinburgh&#x27;s Edinburgh Concurrent Supercomputer Project. Also, the Data Acquisition and Second Level Trigger systems of the High Energy Physics ZEUS Experiment for the Hadron Elektron Ring Anlage (HERA) collider at DESY was based on a network of over 300 synchronously clocked transputers divided into several subsystems. These controlled both the readout of the custom detector electronics and ran reconstruction algorithms for physics event selection.

The parallel processing abilities of the transputer were put to use commercially for image processing by the world&#x27;s largest printing company, RR Donnelley &amp; Sons, in the early 1990s. The ability to quickly transform digital images in preparation for print gave the firm a significant edge over their competitors. This development was led by Michael Bengtson in the RR Donnelley Technology Center. Within a few years, the processing ability of even desktop computers ended the need for custom multi-processing systems for the firm.

The German company Jäger Messtechnik used transputers for their early ADwin real-time data acquisition and control products.

A French company built the Archipel Volvox Supercomputer with up to 144 T800 and T400 Transputers. It was controlled by a Silicon Graphics Indigo2 running UNIX and a special card that interfaced to the Volvox backplanes.

Transputers also found use in protocol analysers such as the Siemens/Tektronix K1103 and in military applications where the array architecture suited applications such as radar and the serial links (that were high speed in the 1980s) served well to save cost and weight in sub-system communications.

The transputer also appeared in products related to virtual reality such as the ProVision 100 system made by Division Limited of Bristol, featuring a combination of Intel i860, 80486/33 and Toshiba HSP processors, together with T805 or T425 transputers, implementing a rendering engine that could then be accessed as a server by PC, Sun SPARCstation or VAX systems.

Myriade, a European miniaturized satellite platform developed by Astrium Satellites and CNES and used by satellites such as the Picard, is based on the T805 yielding around 4 MIPS and is scheduled to stay in production until about 2015.

The asynchronous operation of the communications and computation allowed the development of asynchronous algorithms, such as Bane&#x27;s &quot;Asychronous Polynomial Zero Finding&quot; algorithm. The field of asynchronous algorithms, and the asynchronous implementation of current algorithms, is likely to play a key role in the move to exascale computing.

The High Energy Transient Explorer 2 (HETE-2) spacecraft used 4× T805 transputers and 8× DSP56001 yielding about 100 million instructions per second (MIPS) of performance.

== Legacy ==
Growing internal parallelism has been one driving force behind improvements in conventional CPU designs. Instead of explicit thread-level parallelism (as is used in the transputer), CPU designs exploited implicit parallelism at the instruction-level, inspecting code sequences for data dependencies and issuing multiple independent instructions to different execution units. This is termed superscalar processing. Superscalar processors are suited for optimising the execution of sequentially constructed fragments of code. The combination of superscalar processing and speculative execution delivered a tangible performance increase on existing bodies of code – which were mostly written in Pascal, Fortran, C and C++. Given these substantial and regular performance improvements to existing code there was little incentive to rewrite software in languages or coding styles which expose more task-level parallelism.

Nevertheless, the model of cooperating concurrent processors can still be found in cluster computing systems that dominate supercomputer design in the 21st century. Unlike the transputer architecture, the processing units in these systems typically use superscalar CPUs with access to substantial amounts of memory and disk storage, running conventional operating systems and network interfaces. Resulting from the more complex nodes, the software architecture used for coordinating the parallelism in such systems is typically far more heavyweight than in the transputer architecture.

The fundamental transputer motive remains, yet was masked for over 20 years by the repeated doubling of transistor counts. Inevitably, microprocessor designers finally ran out of uses for the greater physical resources, almost at the same time when technology scaling began to hit its limits. Power consumption, and thus heat dissipation needs, render further clock rate increases unfeasible. These factors led the industry towards solutions little different in essence from those proposed by Inmos.

Some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, based on designs from Columbia University and built as IBM Blue Gene, are real-world incarnations of the transputer dream. They are vast assemblies of identical, relatively low-performance SoCs.

Recent trends have also tried to solve the transistor dilemma in ways that would have been too futuristic even for Inmos. On top of adding components to the CPU die and placing multiple dies in one system, modern processors increasingly place multiple cores in one die. The transputer designers struggled to fit even one core into its transistor budget. Today designers, working with a 1000-fold increase in transistor densities, can now typically place many. One of the most recent commercial developments has emerged from the firm XMOS, which has developed a family of embedded multi-core multi-threaded processors which resonate strongly with the transputer and Inmos. There is an emerging class of multicore/manycore processors taking the approach of a &quot;network on a chip&quot; (NoC), such as the Cell processor, Adapteva Epiphany architecture, Tilera, etc.

The transputer and Inmos helped establish Bristol, UK, as a hub for microelectronic design and innovation.

<text>Posidonius (; , &quot;of Poseidon&quot;) &quot;of Apameia&quot; (ὁ Ἀπαμεύς) or &quot;of Rhodes&quot; (ὁ Ῥόδιος) (), was a Greek politician, astronomer, astrologer, geographer, historian, mathematician, and teacher native to Apamea, Syria. He was considered the most learned man of his time and, possibly, of the entire Stoic school. After a period learning Stoic philosophy from Panaetius in Athens, he spent many years in travel and scientific researches in Spain, Africa, Italy, Gaul, Liguria, Sicily and on the eastern shores of the Adriatic. He settled as a teacher at Rhodes where his fame attracted numerous scholars. Next to Panaetius he did most, by writings and personal lectures, to spread Stoicism to the Roman world, and he became well known to many leading men, including Pompey and Cicero.

His works are now lost, but they proved a mine of information to later writers. The titles and subjects of more than twenty of them are known. In common with other Stoics of the middle period, he displayed syncretic tendencies, following not just the earlier Stoics, but making use of the works of Plato and Aristotle. A polymath as well as a philosopher, he took genuine interest in natural science, geography, natural history, mathematics and astronomy. He sought to determine the distance and magnitude of the Sun, to calculate the diameter of the Earth and the influence of the Moon on the tides.

==Life==
===Early life and education===
Posidonius, nicknamed &quot;the Athlete&quot; (Ἀθλητής), was born around 135 BC. He was born into a Greek family in Apamea, a Hellenistic city on the river Orontes in northern Syria. As historian Philip Freeman puts it: &quot;Posidonius was Greek to the core&quot;. Posidonius expressed no love for his native city, Apamea, in his writings and he mocked its inhabitants.

As a young man he moved to Athens and studied under Panaetius, the leading Stoic philosopher of the age, and the last undisputed head (scholarch) of the Stoic school in Athens. When Panaetius died in 110 BC, Posidonius would have been around 25 years old. Rather than remain in Athens, he instead settled in Rhodes, and gained citizenship. In Rhodes, Posidonius maintained his own school which would become the leading institution of the time.

===Travels===
Around the 90s BC Posidonius embarked on a series of voyages around the Mediterranean gathering scientific data and observing the customs and people of the places he visited. He traveled in Greece, Hispania, Italy, Sicily, Dalmatia, Gaul, Liguria, North Africa, and on the eastern shores of the Adriatic.

In Hispania, on the Atlantic coast at Gades (the modern Cadiz), Posidonius could observe tides much higher than in his native Mediterranean. He wrote that daily tides are related to the Moon&#x27;s orbit, while tidal heights vary with the cycles of the Moon, and he hypothesized about yearly tidal cycles synchronized with the equinoxes and solstices.

In Gaul, he studied the Celts. He left descriptions of customs such as nailing skulls to doorways as trophies, which he witnessed, and vivid legends told to him by the Celts, such as a story that in the past, men were paid to allow their throats to be slit for public amusement. But he noted that the Celts honored the Druids, whom Posidonius saw as philosophers, and concluded that, even among the barbaric, &quot;pride and passion give way to wisdom, and Ares stands in awe of the Muses.&quot; Posidonius wrote a geographic treatise on the lands of the Celts which has since been lost, but which is referred to extensively (both directly and otherwise) in the works of Diodorus of Sicily, Strabo, Caesar and Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Germania&quot;.

===Political offices===
In Rhodes, Posidonius actively took part in political life, and he attained high office when he was appointed as one of the Prytaneis. This was the most important political office in Rhodes, combining presidential and executive functions, of which there were five (or possibly six) men holding the office for a six-month period.

He was chosen for at least one embassy to Rome in 87/86, during the Marian and Sullan era. Although the purpose of the embassy is unknown, this was at the time of the First Mithridatic War when Roman rule over the Greek cities was being challenged by Mithridates VI of Pontus and the political situation was delicate.

===The Stoic school on Rhodes===
Under Posidonius, Rhodes eclipsed Athens to become the new centre for Stoic philosophy in the 1st century BC. This process may have already have begun under Panaetius, who was a native of Rhodes, and may have fostered a school there. Ian Kidd remarks that Rhodes &quot;was attractive, not only as an independent city, commercially prosperous, go-ahead and with easy links of movement in all directions, but because it was welcoming to intellectuals, for it already had a strong reputation particularly for scientific research from men like Hipparchus.&quot;

Although little is known of the organization of his school, it is clear that Posidonius had a steady stream of Greek and Roman students, as demonstrated by the eminent Romans who visited it. Pompey sat in on a lecture in 66 and did so again in 62 on return from campaigning in the East. On this latter occasion the subject of the lecture was &quot;There is no good but moral good&quot;. Posidonius was probably in his seventies at this time and was suffering from gout. He illustrated the theme of his lecture by pointing to his painful leg and declaring &quot;It is no good, pain; bothersome you may be, but you will never persuade me that you are an evil.&quot;

When Cicero was in his late twenties, he attended a course of Posidonius&#x27; lectures, and later invited Posidonius to write a monograph on Cicero&#x27;s own consulship (Posidonius politely refused). In his later writings Cicero repeatedly refers to Posidonius as &quot;my teacher&quot; and &quot;my dear friend&quot;. Posidonius died in his eighties in 51 BC; his grandson, Jason of Nysa, succeeded him as head of the school on Rhodes.

==Partial scope of writings==
Posidonius was celebrated as a polymath throughout the Graeco-Roman world because he came near to mastering all the knowledge of his time, similar to Aristotle and Eratosthenes. He attempted to create a unified system for understanding the human intellect and the universe which would provide an explanation of and a guide for human behavior.

Posidonius wrote on physics (including meteorology and physical geography), astronomy, astrology and divination, seismology, geology and mineralogy, hydrology, botany, ethics, logic, mathematics, history, natural history, anthropology, and tactics. His studies were major investigations into their subjects, although not without errors.

None of his works survives intact. All that have been found are fragments, although the titles and subjects of many of his books are known. Writers such as Strabo and Seneca provide most of the information about his life and works.

==Philosophy==
For Posidonius, philosophy was the dominant master art and all the individual sciences were subordinate to philosophy, which alone could explain the cosmos. All his works, from scientific to historical, were inseparably philosophical.

He accepted the Stoic categorization of philosophy into physics (natural philosophy, including metaphysics and theology), logic (including dialectic), and ethics. These three categories for him were, in Stoic fashion, inseparable and interdependent parts of an organic, natural whole. He compared them to a living being, with physics the flesh and blood, logic the bones and tendons holding the organism together, and finally ethics—the most important part—corresponding to the soul.

Although a firm Stoic, Posidonius was syncretic like Panaetius and other Stoics of the middle period. He followed not only the earlier Stoics, but made use of the writings of Plato and Aristotle. Posidonius studied Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot;, and seems to have written a commentary on it emphasizing its Pythagorean features. As a creative philosopher, Posidonius would however be expected to create innovations within the tradition of the philosophical school to which he belonged. David Sedley remarks:

===Ethics===
Ethics, Posidonius taught, is about practice not just theory. It involves knowledge of both the human and the divine, and a knowledge of the universe to which human reason is related.

It was once the general view that Posidonius departed from the monistic psychology of the earlier Stoics. Chrysippus had written a work called &quot;On Passions&quot; in which he affirmed that reason and emotion were not separate and distinct faculties, and that destructive passions were instead rational impulses which were out-of-control. According to the testimony of Galen (an adherent of Plato), Posidonius wrote his own &quot;On Passions&quot; in which he instead adopted Plato&#x27;s tripartition of the soul which taught that in addition to the rational faculties, the human soul had faculties that were spirited (anger, desires for power, possessions, etc.) and desiderative (desires for sex and food). Although Galen&#x27;s testimony is still accepted by some, more recent scholarship argues that Galen may have exaggerated Posidonius&#x27; views for polemical effect, and that Posidonius may have been trying to clarify and expand on Chrysippus rather than oppose him. Other writers who knew the ethical works of Posidonius, including Cicero and Seneca, grouped Chrysippus and Posidonius together and saw no opposition between them.

===Physics===
The philosophical grand vision of Posidonius was that the universe itself was interconnected as an organic whole, providential and organised in all respects, from the development of the physical world to the behaviour of living creatures. Panaetius had doubted both the reality of divination and the Stoic doctrine of the future conflagration (ekpyrosis), but Posidonius wrote in favour of these ideas. As a Stoic, Posidonius was an advocate of cosmic &quot;sympathy&quot; (συμπάθεια, &quot;sympatheia&quot;)—the organic interrelation of all appearances in the world, from the sky to the Earth, as part of a rational design uniting humanity and all things in the universe. He believed valid predictions could be made from signs in nature—whether through astrology or prophetic dreams—as a kind of scientific prediction.

===Mathematics===
Posidonius was one of the first to attempt to prove Euclid&#x27;s fifth postulate of geometry. He suggested changing the definition of parallel straight lines to an equivalent statement that would allow him to prove the fifth postulate. From there, Euclidean geometry could be restructured, placing the fifth postulate among the theorems instead.

In addition to his writings on geometry, Posidonius was credited for creating some mathematical definitions, or for articulating views on technical terms, for example &#x27;theorem&#x27; and &#x27;problem&#x27;.

===Astronomy and meteorology===
Some fragments of his writings on astronomy survive through the treatise by Cleomedes, &quot;On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies&quot;, the first chapter of the second book appearing to have been mostly copied from Posidonius.

Posidonius advanced the theory that the Sun emanated a vital force that permeated the world.

He attempted to measure the distance and size of the Sun. In about 90 BC, Posidonius estimated the distance from the Earth to the Sun (see astronomical unit) to be 9,893 times the Earth&#x27;s radius. This was still too small by half. In measuring the size of the Sun, however, he reached a figure larger and more accurate than those proposed by other Greek astronomers and Aristarchus of Samos.

Posidonius also calculated the size and distance of the Moon.

Posidonius constructed an orrery, possibly similar to the Antikythera mechanism. Posidonius&#x27;s orrery, according to Cicero, exhibited the diurnal motions of the Sun, Moon, and the five known planets.

Posidonius in his writings on meteorology followed Aristotle. He theorized on the causes of clouds, mist, wind, and rain as well as frost, hail, lightning, and rainbows. He also estimated that the boundary between the clouds and the heavens lies about 40 stadia above the Earth.

=== Geography, ethnology, and geology ===

Posidonius&#x27;s fame beyond specialized philosophical circles had begun, at the latest, in the eighties with the publication of the work &quot;&quot;. This work was not only an overall representation of geographical questions according to current scientific knowledge, but it served to popularize his theories about the internal connections of the world, to show how all the forces had an effect on each other and how the interconnectedness applied also to human life, to the political just as to the personal spheres.

In this work, Posidonius detailed his theory of the effect on a people&#x27;s character by the climate, which included his representation of the &quot;geography of the races&quot;. This theory was not solely scientific, but also had political implications—his Roman readers were informed that the climatic central position of Italy was an essential condition of the Roman destiny to dominate the world. As a Stoic, he did not, however, make a fundamental distinction between the civilized Romans as masters of the world and the less civilized peoples. Posidonius&#x27;s writings on the Jews were probably the source of Diodorus Siculus&#x27;s account of the siege of Jerusalem and possibly also for Strabo&#x27;s. Some of Posidonius&#x27;s arguments are contested by Josephus in &quot;Against Apion&quot;.

Like Pytheas, Posidonius believed the tide is caused by the Moon. Posidonius was, however, wrong about the cause. Thinking that the Moon was a mixture of air and fire, he attributed the cause of the tides to the heat of the Moon, hot enough to cause the water to swell but not hot enough to evaporate it.

He recorded observations on both earthquakes and volcanoes, including accounts of the eruptions of the volcanoes in the Aeolian Islands, north of Sicily.

====Earth&#x27;s circumference====

Posidonius calculated the Earth&#x27;s circumference by the arc measurement method, by reference to the position of the star Canopus. As explained by Cleomedes, Posidonius observed Canopus on but never above the horizon at Rhodes, while at Alexandria he saw it ascend as far as 7½ degrees above the horizon (the meridian arc between the latitude of the two locales is actually 5 degrees 14 minutes). Since he thought Rhodes was 5,000 stadia due north of Alexandria, and the difference in the star&#x27;s elevation indicated the distance between the two locales was 1/48 of the circle, he multiplied 5,000 stadia by 48 to arrive at a figure of 240,000 stadia for the circumference of the Earth.

His estimate of the latitude difference of these two points, 360 degrees/48=7.5 degrees, is rather erroneous. (The modern value is approximately 5 degrees.) In addition, they are not quite on the same meridian as they were assumed to be. The longitude difference of the points, slightly less than 2 degrees, is not negligible compared with the latitude difference.

Translating stadia into modern units of distance can be problematic, but it is generally thought that the stadion used by Posidonius was almost exactly 1/10 of a modern statute mile. Thus Posidonius&#x27;s measure of 240,000 stadia translates to compared to the actual circumference of .
Posidonius was informed in his approach to finding the Earth&#x27;s circumference by Eratosthenes, who a century earlier arrived at a figure of 252,000 stadia; both men&#x27;s figures for the Earth&#x27;s circumference were uncannily accurate.

Strabo noted that the distance between Rhodes and Alexandria is 3,750 stadia, and reported Posidonius&#x27;s estimate of the Earth&#x27;s circumference to be 180,000 stadia or . Pliny the Elder mentions Posidonius among his sources and without naming him reported his method for estimating the Earth&#x27;s circumference. He noted, however, that Hipparchus had added some 26,000 stadia to Eratosthenes&#x27;s estimate. The smaller value offered by Strabo and the different lengths of Greek and Roman stadia have created a persistent confusion around Posidonius&#x27;s result. Ptolemy used Posidonius&#x27;s lower value of 180,000 stades (about 33% too low) for the Earth&#x27;s circumference in his &quot;Geography&quot;. This was the number used by Christopher Columbus to underestimate the distance to India as 70,000 stades.

===History and tactics===
In his &quot;Histories&quot;, Posidonius continued the &quot;World History&quot; of Polybius. His history of the period 146–88 BC is said to have filled 52 volumes. His &quot;Histories&quot; continue the account of the rise and expansion of Roman dominance, which he appears to have supported. Posidonius did not follow Polybius&#x27;s more detached and factual style, for Posidonius saw events as caused by human psychology; while he understood human passions and follies, he did not pardon or excuse them in his historical writing, using his narrative skill in fact to enlist the readers&#x27; approval or condemnation.

For Posidonius &quot;history&quot; extended beyond the earth into the sky; humanity was not isolated each in its own political history, but was a part of the cosmos. His &quot;Histories&quot; were not, therefore, concerned with isolated political history of peoples and individuals, but they included discussions of all forces and factors (geographical factors, mineral resources, climate, nutrition), which let humans act and be a part of their environment. For example, Posidonius considered the climate of Arabia and the life-giving strength of the sun, tides (taken from his book on the oceans), and climatic theory to explain people&#x27;s ethnic or national characters.

Of Posidonius&#x27;s work on tactics, &quot;The Art of War&quot;, the Greek historian Arrian complained that it was written &#x27;for experts&#x27;, which suggests that Posidonius may have had first hand experience of military leadership or, perhaps, used knowledge he gained from his acquaintance with Pompey.

==Reputation and influence==

In his own era, his writings on almost all the principal divisions of philosophy made Posidonius a renowned international figure throughout the Graeco-Roman world and he was widely cited by writers of his era, including Cicero, Livy, Plutarch, Strabo (who called Posidonius &quot;the most learned of all philosophers of my time&quot;), Cleomedes, Seneca the Younger, Diodorus Siculus (who used Posidonius as a source for his &quot;Bibliotheca Historia&quot; [&quot;Historical Library&quot;]), and others. Although his ornate and rhetorical style of writing passed out of fashion soon after his death, Posidonius was acclaimed during his life for his literary ability and as a stylist.

Posidonius was the major source of materials on the Celts of Gaul and was profusely quoted by Timagenes, Julius Caesar, the Sicilian Greek Diodorus Siculus, and the Greek geographer Strabo.

Posidonius appears to have moved with ease among the upper echelons of Roman society as an ambassador from Rhodes. He associated with some of the leading figures of late republican Rome, including Cicero and Pompey, both of whom visited him in Rhodes. In his twenties, Cicero attended his lectures (77 BC) and they continued to correspond. Cicero in his &quot;De Finibus&quot; closely followed Posidonius&#x27;s presentation of Panaetius&#x27;s ethical teachings.

Posidonius met Pompey when he was Rhodes&#x27;s ambassador in Rome and Pompey visited him in Rhodes twice, once in 66 BC during his campaign against the pirates and again in 62 BC during his eastern campaigns, and asked Posidonius to write his biography. As a gesture of respect and great honor, Pompey lowered his &quot;fasces&quot; before Posidonius&#x27;s door. Other Romans who visited Posidonius in Rhodes were Velleius, Cotta, and Lucilius.

Ptolemy was impressed by the sophistication of Posidonius&#x27;s methods, which included correcting for the refraction of light passing through denser air near the horizon. Ptolemy&#x27;s approval of Posidonius&#x27;s result, rather than Eratosthenes&#x27;s earlier and more correct figure, caused it to become the accepted value for the Earth&#x27;s circumference for the next 1,500 years.

Posidonius fortified the Stoicism of the middle period with contemporary learning. Next to his teacher Panaetius, he did most, by writings and personal contacts, to spread Stoicism in the Roman world. A century later, Seneca referred to Posidonius as one of those who had made the largest contribution to philosophy.

His influence on Greek philosophical thinking lasted until the Middle Ages, as is demonstrated by the large number of times he is cited as a source in the &quot;Suda&quot; (a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia).

Wilhelm Capelle traced most of the doctrines of the popular philosophic treatise &quot;De Mundo&quot; to Posidonius. Today, Posidonius seems to be recognized as having had an inquiring and wide-ranging mind, not entirely original, but with a breadth of view that connected, in accordance with his underlying Stoic philosophy, all things and their causes and all knowledge into an overarching, unified world view.

The crater Posidonius on the Moon is named after him.

<text>The antiproton, , (pronounced &quot;p-bar&quot;) is the antiparticle of the proton. Antiprotons are stable, but they are typically short-lived, since any collision with a proton will cause both particles to be annihilated in a burst of energy.

The existence of the antiproton with electric charge of , opposite to the electric charge of of the proton, was predicted by Paul Dirac in his 1933 Nobel Prize lecture. Dirac received the Nobel Prize for his 1928 publication of his Dirac equation that predicted the existence of positive and negative solutions to Einstein&#x27;s energy equation (formula_1) and the existence of the positron, the antimatter analog of the electron, with opposite charge and spin.

The antiproton was first experimentally confirmed in 1955 at the Bevatron particle accelerator by University of California, Berkeley physicists Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain, for which they were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics.

In terms of valence quarks, an antiproton consists of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark (). The properties of the antiproton that have been measured all match the corresponding properties of the proton, with the exception that the antiproton has electric charge and magnetic moment that are the opposites of those in the proton, which is to be expected from the antimatter equivalent of a proton. The questions of how matter is different from antimatter, and the relevance of antimatter in explaining how our universe survived the Big Bang, remain open problems—open, in part, due to the relative scarcity of antimatter in today&#x27;s universe.

==Occurrence in nature==
Antiprotons have been detected in cosmic rays beginning in 1979, first by balloon-borne experiments and more recently by satellite-based detectors. The standard picture for their presence in cosmic rays is that they are produced in collisions of cosmic ray protons with atomic nuclei in the interstellar medium, via the reaction, where A represents a nucleus:

 + A → + + + A

The secondary antiprotons () then propagate through the galaxy, confined by the galactic magnetic fields. Their energy spectrum is modified by collisions with other atoms in the interstellar medium, and antiprotons can also be lost by &quot;leaking out&quot; of the galaxy.

The antiproton cosmic ray energy spectrum is now measured reliably and is consistent with this standard picture of antiproton production by cosmic ray collisions. These experimental measurements set upper limits on the number of antiprotons that could be produced in exotic ways, such as from annihilation of supersymmetric dark matter particles in the galaxy or from the Hawking radiation caused by the evaporation of primordial black holes. This also provides a lower limit on the antiproton lifetime of about 1–10 million years. Since the galactic storage time of antiprotons is about 10 million years, an intrinsic decay lifetime would modify the galactic residence time and distort the spectrum of cosmic ray antiprotons. This is significantly more stringent than the best laboratory measurements of the antiproton lifetime:

* LEAR collaboration at CERN: 
* Antihydrogen Penning trap of Gabrielse et al.: 
* BASE experiment at CERN: 
* APEX collaboration at Fermilab: for → + anything
* APEX collaboration at Fermilab: for → + 

The magnitude of properties of the antiproton are predicted by CPT symmetry to be exactly related to those of the proton. In particular, CPT symmetry predicts the mass and lifetime of the antiproton to be the same as those of the proton, and the electric charge and magnetic moment of the antiproton to be opposite in sign and equal in magnitude to those of the proton. CPT symmetry is a basic consequence of quantum field theory and no violations of it have ever been detected.

===List of recent cosmic ray detection experiments===

* BESS: balloon-borne experiment, flown in 1993, 1995, 1997, 2000, 2002, 2004 (Polar-I) and 2007 (Polar-II).
* CAPRICE: balloon-borne experiment, flown in 1994 and 1998.
* HEAT: balloon-borne experiment, flown in 2000.
* AMS: space-based experiment, prototype flown on the Space Shuttle in 1998, intended for the International Space Station, launched May 2011.
* PAMELA: satellite experiment to detect cosmic rays and antimatter from space, launched June 2006. Recent report discovered 28 antiprotons in the South Atlantic Anomaly.

==Modern experiments and applications==
=== Production ===
Antiprotons were routinely produced at Fermilab for collider physics operations in the Tevatron, where they were collided with protons. The use of antiprotons allows for a higher average energy of collisions between quarks and antiquarks than would be possible in proton–proton collisions. This is because the valence quarks in the proton, and the valence antiquarks in the antiproton, tend to carry the largest fraction of the proton or antiproton&#x27;s momentum.

Formation of antiprotons requires energy equivalent to a temperature of 10 trillion K (1013 K), and this does not tend to happen naturally. However, at CERN, protons are accelerated in the Proton Synchrotron to an energy of 26 GeV and then smashed into an iridium rod. The protons bounce off the iridium nuclei with enough energy for matter to be created. A range of particles and antiparticles are formed, and the antiprotons are separated off using magnets in vacuum.

=== Measurements ===
In July 2011, the ASACUSA experiment at CERN determined the mass of the antiproton to be times that of the electron. This is the same as the mass of a proton, within the level of certainty of the experiment.

In October 2017, scientists working on the BASE experiment at CERN reported a measurement of the antiproton magnetic moment to a precision of 1.5 parts per billion. It is consistent with the most precise measurement of the proton magnetic moment (also made by BASE in 2014), which supports the hypothesis of CPT symmetry. This measurement represents the first time that a property of antimatter is known more precisely than the equivalent property in matter.

In January 2022, by comparing the charge-to-mass ratios between antiproton and negatively charged hydrogen ion, the BASE experiment has determined the antiproton&#x27;s charge-to-mass ratio is identical to the proton&#x27;s, down to 16 parts per trillion.

=== Possible applications ===
Antiprotons have been shown within laboratory experiments to have the potential to treat certain cancers, in a similar method currently used for ion (proton) therapy. The primary difference between antiproton therapy and proton therapy is that following ion energy deposition the antiproton annihilates, depositing additional energy in the cancerous region.

<text>Drawn thread work is one of the earliest forms of open work embroidery, and has been worked throughout Europe. Originally it was often used for ecclesiastical items and to ornament shrouds. It is a form of counted-thread embroidery based on removing threads from the warp and/or the weft of a piece of even-weave fabric. 
The remaining threads are grouped or bundled together into a variety of patterns. The more elaborate styles of drawn thread work use a variety of other stitches and techniques, but the drawn thread parts are their most distinctive element. It is also grouped with whitework embroidery because it was traditionally done in white thread on white fabric and is often combined with other whitework techniques.

== History ==
Drawn thread embroidery is a very early form of open work embroidery, and is the basis of lace. Drawn thread work from the 12th century was known as Opus Tiratum and Punto Tirato from the Arab Tiraz workshops in Palermo. Forms of drawn thread work were known and created throughout Europe, often for ecclesiastical purposes or to decorate shrouds. Early examples have been found in which the work is done on linen so fine that magnification is needed to see the work.

==Techniques==


===Basic hemstitching===
The simplest kind of drawn thread work is hemstitching, which is often used to decorate the trimmings of clothes or household linens. The transition from elaborate hemstitching to more advanced styles of drawn thread work is not clearly defined.

===Needle-weaving===
This relatively easy type of drawn thread work is created by weaving (or darning) the embroidering thread into the laid warp or weft threads to create patterns of light-colored threads and dark openings in the drawn-thread cloth. Needleweaving is most often used for decorative borders. It is nearly always used in combination with other types of embroidery stitches. Together they create a complete design and, historically, in ethnic embroidery, distinctive embroidery styles, also known as &quot;needle-darning.&quot;
===Other drawn-thread===
A form of double-drawnwork, where both warp and weft are removed at regular intervals, creating voided areas. These areas can be left as is or filled with needlelace or other elements.

===Styles===
====Hardanger====

Hardanger embroidery is a style of drawn thread work that is most popular today. It originally comes from Norway, from the traditional district of Hardanger. The backbone of Hardanger designs consists of satin stitches. In geometrical areas both warp and weft threads are removed and the remaining mesh is secured with simple weaving or warping or with a limited number of simple filling patterns. The designs tend to be geometric, if they include flowers or such they are very stylized due to the nature of the technique. Hardanger never includes Buttonhole stitches, except for securing the edges of a piece of fabric. It is usually executed using rather coarse fabric and thread.

====Ukrainian ====
There are many styles of Ukrainian drawn thread. In &quot;merezhka&quot; (drawn-work), threads of the ground cloth are cut only vertically. Vyrizuvannya (&quot;cutwork&quot;) is often drawn in two directions. 
&quot;Poltava-style&quot; &quot;merezhka&quot; might be translated into English as &quot;layerings&quot;.The technique for doing Poltava-style basically involves withdrawing sets of parallel threads of weft while leaving others in place, then using the antique hem-stitch (called &quot;prutyk&quot;) and this special &quot;layerings&quot; technique to create both the openwork &quot;net&quot; and areas of solid needle-weaving 

====Drawn-thread work with Needlelace====
Reticella lace is a form of embroidery in which typical techniques of needlelace are used to embellish drawn thread work. It was first used in 16th century Italy. Needlelace evolved from this when the lacemakers realized that they can do the same things without any supporting fabric. High quality reticella is done with thread almost as thin as sewing silk. Ruskin lace is in fact a near-modern form of it. Warp and weft threads are removed, and the remaining threads are overcast with buttonhole stitches, as in needlelace.

Another embroidery style that combines drawn thread work with needlelace techniques is Hedebo from Denmark, which originates from the area around Copenhagen and Roskilde. It uses techniques that are clearly distinct from reticella and traditional Italian needlelace on the one hand and Hardanger on the other. It does make extensive use of buttonhole stitches, but they are done slightly differently than in Italian embroidery.

<text>Michael Jecks (born 1960, Surrey) is an English writer of historical mystery novels.

==Early life==
The son of an actuary, and the fourth of four brothers, Jecks worked in the computer industry before becoming a novelist full-time in 1994 after he was fired from his last position. He, his wife, daughter and son live in northern Dartmoor.

==Career==
Jecks has written a series of novels featuring Sir Baldwin Furnshill, a former Knight Templar, and his friend Simon Puttock, Bailiff of Lydford Castle. He founded &quot;The Medieval Murderers&quot;, a speaking and entertainment group of historical writers including Bernard Knight, Ian Morson, Susanna Gregory, Phillip Gooden and CJ Sansom. The group has developed to collaborate on their books written as linked novellas, each book with a consistent theme, under the brand of &quot;The Medieval Murderers&quot;. More recently he helped create the &quot;Historical Writers&#x27; Association&quot;.

A member of the Society of Authors and Royal Literary Society, Jecks was the Chairman of the Crime Writers&#x27; Association in 2004–05. In 2005 he became a member of the Detection Club. From 1998 he organised the CWA Debut Dagger competition for two years, helping unpublished authors to win their first contracts. He was shortlisted for the Theakston&#x27;s Old Peculiar Best Novel of the Year prize in 2007. He also judged the CWA/Ian Fleming Steel Dagger Award for three years.

Jecks speaks at literary festivals and historical meetings, at which he talks with Ian Mortimer, the historian, as well as Medieval Murderers. He helped create the Conway Stewart Detection Collection with a pen named for him. In 2014 he was the Grand Master of the Krewe of Little Rascals parade, the first parade of the New Orleans Mardi Gras. In the same year he was invited to be the International Guest of Honour at the Toronto Bloody Words Festival.

Jecks has embarked on a trilogy of Hundred Years&#x27; War stories with Simon and Schuster UK. The first, &quot;Fields of Glory&quot;, was published in 2014. The second, &quot;Blood on the Sand&quot;, was published in June 2015. He also has a modern spy thriller published with Kindle, &quot;Act of Vengeance&quot;, and two short story collections: &quot;No One Can Hear You Scream&quot; and &quot;For The Love of Old Bone&quot;s.

<text>The Wandering Jew (occasionally referred to as the Eternal Jew, an antisemitic calque from German ) is a mythical immortal man whose legend began to spread in Europe in the 13th century. In the original legend, a Jew who taunted Jesus on the way to the Crucifixion was then cursed to walk the Earth until the Second Coming. The exact nature of the wanderer&#x27;s indiscretion varies in different versions of the tale, as do aspects of his character; sometimes he is said to be a shoemaker or other tradesman, while sometimes he is the doorman at the estate of Pontius Pilate.

==Joseph==
An early extant manuscript containing the legend is the &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot; by Roger of Wendover, where it appears in the part for the year 1228, under the title &quot;Of the Jew Joseph who is still alive awaiting the last coming of Christ&quot;. The central figure is named &quot;Cartaphilus&quot; before being baptized later by Ananias as &quot;Joseph&quot;. The root of the name &quot;Cartaphilus&quot; can be divided into and , which can be translated roughly as &quot;dearly&quot; and &quot;loved&quot;, connecting the legend of the Wandering Jew to &quot;the disciple whom Jesus loved&quot;.

At least from the 17th century, the name &quot;Ahasver&quot; has been given to the Wandering Jew, apparently adapted from Ahasuerus (Xerxes), the Persian king in the Book of Esther, who was not a Jew, and whose very name among medieval Jews was an of a fool. This name may have been chosen because the Book of Esther describes the Jews as a persecuted people, scattered across every province of Ahasuerus&#x27; vast empire, similar to the later Jewish diaspora in countries whose state and/or majority religions were forms of Christianity.
A variety of names have since been given to the Wandering Jew, including &quot;Matathias&quot;, &quot;Buttadeus&quot; and &quot;Isaac Laquedem&quot;, which is a name for him in France and the Low Countries in popular legend as well as in a novel by Dumas. The name &quot;Paul Marrane&quot; (an anglicized version of Giovanni Paolo Marana, the alleged author of &quot;Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy&quot;) was incorrectly attributed to the Wandering Jew by a 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; article, yet the mistake influenced popular culture. The name given to the Wandering Jew in the spy&#x27;s Letters is &quot;Michob Ader&quot;.

The name &quot;Buttadeus&quot; (&quot;Botadeo&quot; in Italian; &quot;Boutedieu&quot; in French) most likely has its origin in a combination of the Vulgar Latin version of (&quot;to beat or strike&quot;) with the word for God, . Sometimes this name is misinterpreted as &quot;Votadeo&quot;, meaning &quot;devoted to God&quot;, drawing similarities to the etymology of the name &quot;Cartaphilus&quot;.

Where German or Russian is spoken, the emphasis has been on the perpetual character of his punishment, and thus he is known there as and (), the &quot;Eternal Jew&quot;. In French and other Romance languages, the usage has been to refer to the wanderings, as in (French), (Spanish) or (Italian), and this has been followed in English from the Middle Ages as the &quot;Wandering Jew&quot;. In Finnish, he is known as (&quot;Shoemaker of Jerusalem&quot;), implying he was a cobbler by his trade. In Hungarian, he is known as the (&quot;Wandering Jew&quot; but with a connotation of aimlessness).

==Origin and evolution==
===Biblical sources===

The origins of the legend are uncertain; perhaps one element is the story in Genesis of Cain, who is issued with a similar punishment—to wander the Earth, scavenging and never reaping, although without the related punishment of endlessness. According to Jehoshua Gilboa, many commentators have pointed to Hosea 9:17 as a statement of the notion of the &quot;eternal/wandering Jew&quot;. The legend stems from Jesus&#x27; words given in Matthew :

A belief that the disciple whom Jesus loved would not die was apparently popular enough in the early Christian world to be denounced in the Gospel of John:

Another passage in the Gospel of John speaks about a guard of the high priest who slaps Jesus (John 18:19–23). Earlier, the Gospel of John talks about Simon Peter striking the ear from Malchus, a servant of the high priest (John 18:10). Although this servant is probably not the same guard who struck Jesus, Malchus is nonetheless one of the many names given to the wandering Jew in later legend.

===Early Christianity===

The later amalgamation of the fate of the specific figure of legend with the condition of the Jewish people as a whole, well established by the 18th century, had its precursor even in early Christian views of Jews and the diaspora. Extant manuscripts have shown that as early as the time of Tertullian (), some Christian proponents were likening the Jewish people to a &quot;new Cain&quot;, asserting that they would be &quot;fugitives and wanderers (upon) the earth&quot;.

Aurelius Prudentius Clemens (b. 348) writes in his &quot;Apotheosis&quot; (c. 400): &quot;From place to place the homeless Jew wanders in ever-shifting exile, since the time when he was torn from the abode of his fathers and has been suffering the penalty for murder, and having stained his hands with the blood of Christ whom he denied, paying the price of sin.&quot;

A late 6th and early 7th century monk named Johannes Moschos records an important version of a Malchean figure. In his &quot;Leimonarion&quot;, Moschos recounts meeting a monk named Isidor who had purportedly met a Malchus-type of figure who struck Christ and is therefore punished to wander in eternal suffering and lament:

===Medieval legend===
Some scholars have identified components of the legend of the Eternal Jew in Teutonic legends of the Eternal Hunter, some features of which are derived from Odin mythology.

&quot;In some areas the farmers arranged the rows in their fields in such a way that on Sundays the Eternal Jew might find a resting place. Elsewhere they assumed that he could rest only upon a plough or that he had to be on the go all year and was allowed a respite only on Christmas.&quot;

Most likely drawing on centuries of unwritten folklore, legendry, and oral tradition brought to the West as a product of the Crusades, a Latin chronicle from Bologna, , contains the first written articulation of the Wandering Jew. In the entry for the year 1223, the chronicle describes the report of a group of pilgrims who meet &quot;a certain Jew in Armenia&quot; () who scolded Jesus on his way to be crucified and is therefore doomed to live until the Second Coming. Every hundred years the Jew returns to the age of 30.

A variant of the Wandering Jew legend is recorded in the by Roger of Wendover around the year 1228. An Armenian archbishop, then visiting England, was asked by the monks of St Albans Abbey about the celebrated Joseph of Arimathea, who had spoken to Jesus, and was reported to be still alive. The archbishop answered that he had himself seen such a man in Armenia, and that his name was Cartaphilus, a Jewish shoemaker, who, when Jesus stopped for a second to rest while carrying his cross, hit him, and told him &quot;Go on quicker, Jesus! Go on quicker! Why dost Thou loiter?&quot;, to which Jesus, &quot;with a stern countenance&quot;, is said to have replied: &quot;I shall stand and rest, but thou shalt go on till the last day.&quot; The Armenian bishop also reported that Cartaphilus had since converted to Christianity and spent his wandering days proselytizing and leading a hermit&#x27;s life.
Matthew Paris included this passage from Roger of Wendover in his own history; and other Armenians appeared in 1252 at the Abbey of St Albans, repeating the same story, which was regarded there as a great proof of the truth of the Christian religion. The same Armenian told the story at Tournai in 1243, according to the &quot;Chronicles of Phillip Mouskes&quot; (chapter ii. 491, Brussels, 1839). After that, Guido Bonatti writes people saw the Wandering Jew in Forlì (Italy), in the 13th century; other people saw him in Vienna and elsewhere.

There were claims of sightings of the Wandering Jew throughout Europe and later the Americas, since at least 1542 in Hamburg up to 1868 in Harts Corners, New Jersey. Joseph Jacobs, writing in the 11th edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (1911), commented, &quot;It is difficult to tell in any one of these cases how far the story is an entire fiction and how far some ingenious impostor took advantage of the existence of the myth&quot;. 

Another legend about Jews, the so-called &quot;Red Jews&quot;, was similarly common in Central Europe in the Middle Ages.

==In literature==
===17th and 18th centuries===

The legend became more popular after it appeared in a 17th-century pamphlet of four leaves, (&quot;Short Description and Tale of a Jew with the Name Ahasuerus&quot;). &quot;Here we are told that some fifty years before, a bishop met him in a church at Hamburg, repentant, ill-clothed and distracted at the thought of having to move on in a few weeks.&quot; As with urban legends, particularities lend verisimilitude: the bishop is specifically Paulus von Eitzen, General Superintendent of Schleswig. The legend spread quickly throughout Germany, no less than eight different editions appearing in 1602; altogether forty appeared in Germany before the end of the 18th century. Eight editions in Dutch and Flemish are known; and the story soon passed to France, the first French edition appearing in Bordeaux, 1609, and to England, where it appeared in the form of a parody in 1625. The pamphlet was translated also into Danish and Swedish; and the expression &quot;eternal Jew&quot; is current in Czech, Slovak, and German, . Apparently the pamphlets of 1602 borrowed parts of the descriptions of the wanderer from reports (most notably by Balthasar Russow) about an itinerant preacher called Jürgen.

In France, the Wandering Jew appeared in Simon Tyssot de Patot&#x27;s (1720).

In Britain, a ballad with the title &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot; was included in Thomas Percy&#x27;s &quot;Reliques&quot; published in 1765.

In England, the Wandering Jew makes an appearance in one of the secondary plots in Matthew Lewis&#x27;s Gothic novel &quot;The Monk&quot; (1796). The Wandering Jew is depicted as an exorcist whose origin remains unclear. The Wandering Jew also plays a role in &quot;St. Leon&quot; (1799) by William Godwin. The Wandering Jew also appears in two English broadside ballads of the 17th and 18th centuries, &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot;, and &quot;The Wandering Jew&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;. The former recounts the biblical story of the Wandering Jew&#x27;s encounter with Christ, while the latter tells, from the point of view of the titular character, the succession of English monarchs from William the Conqueror through either King Charles II (in the 17th-century text) or King George II and Queen Caroline (in the 18th-century version).

In 1797, the operetta &quot;The Wandering Jew, or Love&#x27;s Masquerade&quot; by Andrew Franklin was performed in London.

===19th century===
====Britain====

In 1810, Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote a poem in four cantos with the title &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot; but it remained unpublished until 1877. In two other works of Shelley, Ahasuerus appears, as a phantom in his first major poem &quot;Queen Mab: A Philosophical Poem&quot; (1813) and later as a hermit healer in his last major work, the verse drama &quot;Hellas&quot;.

John Galt published a book in 1820 called &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot;.
Thomas Carlyle, in his &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; (1833–34), compares its hero Diogenes Teufelsdröckh on several occasions to the Wandering Jew (also using the German wording ).

In Chapter 15 of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1861) by Charles Dickens, the journeyman Orlick is compared to the Wandering Jew.

George MacDonald includes pieces of the legend in &quot;Thomas Wingfold, Curate&quot; (London, 1876).

====United States====

Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s stories &quot;A Virtuoso&#x27;s Collection&quot; and &quot;Ethan Brand&quot; feature the Wandering Jew serving as a guide to the stories&#x27; characters.

In 1873, a publisher in the United States (Philadelphia, Gebbie) produced &quot;The Legend of the Wandering Jew, a series of twelve designs by Gustave Doré (Reproduced by Photographic Printing) with Explanatory Introduction&quot;, originally made by Doré in 1856 to illustrate a short poem by Pierre-Jean de Béranger. For each one, there was a couplet, such as &quot;Too late he feels, by look, and deed, and word, / How often he has crucified his Lord&quot;.

Eugene Field&#x27;s short story &quot;The Holy Cross&quot; (1899) features the Jew as a character.

In 1901, a New York publisher reprinted, under the title &quot;Tarry Thou Till I Come&quot;, George Croly&#x27;s &quot;Salathiel&quot;, which treated the subject in an imaginative form. It had appeared anonymously in 1828.

In Lew Wallace&#x27;s novel &quot;The Prince of India&quot; (1893), the Wandering Jew is the protagonist. The book follows his adventures through the ages, as he takes part in the shaping of history. An American rabbi, H. M. Bien, turned the character into the &quot;Wandering Gentile&quot; in his novel &quot;Ben-Beor: A Tale of the Anti-Messiah&quot;; in the same year John L. McKeever wrote a novel, &quot;The Wandering Jew: A Tale of the Lost Tribes of Israel&quot;.

A humorous account of the Wandering Jew appears in chapter 54 of Mark Twain&#x27;s 1869 travel book &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot;.

====Germany====

The legend has been the subject of German poems by Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart, , Wilhelm Müller, Nikolaus Lenau, Adelbert von Chamisso, August Wilhelm von Schlegel, Julius Mosen (an epic, 1838), and Ludwig Köhler; of novels by Franz Horn (1818), , and Levin Schücking; and of tragedies by Ernst August Friedrich Klingemann (&quot;, 1827) and Joseph Christian Freiherr von Zedlitz (1844). It is either the Ahasuerus of Klingemann or that of Achim von Arnim in his play, &quot;, to whom Richard Wagner refers in the final passage of his notorious essay .

There are clear echoes of the Wandering Jew in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;, whose plot line is adapted from a story by Heinrich Heine in which the Dutchman is referred to as &quot;the Wandering Jew of the ocean&quot;, and his final opera features a woman called Kundry who is in some ways a female version of the Wandering Jew. It is alleged that she was formerly Herodias, and she admits that she laughed at Jesus on his route to the Crucifixion, and is now condemned to wander until she meets with him again (cf. Eugene Sue&#x27;s version, below).

Robert Hamerling, in his (Vienna, 1866), identifies Nero with the Wandering Jew. Goethe had designed a poem on the subject, the plot of which he sketched in his .

====Denmark====

Hans Christian Andersen made his &quot;Ahasuerus&quot; the Angel of Doubt, and was imitated by Heller in a poem on &quot;The Wandering of Ahasuerus&quot;, which he afterward developed into three cantos. Martin Andersen Nexø wrote a short story named &quot;The Eternal Jew&quot;, in which he also refers to Ahasuerus as the spreading of the Jewish gene pool in Europe.

The story of the Wandering Jew is the basis of the essay &quot;The Unhappiest One&quot; in Søren Kierkegaard&#x27;s &quot;Either/Or&quot; (published 1843 in Copenhagen). It is also discussed in an early portion of the book that focuses on Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;.

In the play (&quot;The Residents&quot;) by Jens Christian Hostrup (1844), the Wandering Jew is a character (in this context called &quot;Jerusalem&#x27;s shoemaker&quot;) and his shoes make the wearer invisible. The protagonist of the play borrows the shoes for a night and visits the house across the street as an invisible man.

====France====
The French writer Edgar Quinet published his prose epic on the legend in 1833, making the subject the judgment of the world; and wrote his in 1844, in which the author connects the story of Ahasuerus with that of Herodias. Grenier&#x27;s 1857 poem on the subject may have been inspired by &#x27;s designs, which were published the preceding year. One should also note &#x27;s (1864), which combines several fictional Wandering Jews, both heroic and evil, and Alexandre Dumas&#x27; incomplete (1853), a sprawling historical saga. In Guy de Maupassant&#x27;s short story &quot;Uncle Judas&quot;, the local people believe that the old man in the story is the Wandering Jew.

In the late 1830&#x27;s, the epic novel &quot;The Wandering Jew,&quot; written by Eugene Sue was published in serialized form.

====Russia====

In Russia, the legend of the Wandering Jew appears in an incomplete epic poem by Vasily Zhukovsky, &quot;Ahasuerus&quot; (1857) and in another epic poem by Wilhelm Küchelbecker, &quot;Ahasuerus, a Poem in Fragments&quot;, written between 1832 and 1846 but not published until 1878, long after the poet&#x27;s death. Alexander Pushkin also began a long poem on Ahasuerus (1826) but later abandoned the project, completing fewer than thirty lines.

====Other literature====

The Wandering Jew makes a notable appearance in the gothic masterpiece of the Polish writer Jan Potocki, &quot;The Manuscript Found in Saragossa&quot;, written about 1797.

Brazilian writer and poet Machado de Assis often used Jewish themes in his writings. One of his short stories, (&quot;To Live!&quot;), is a dialog between the Wandering Jew (named as Ahasverus) and Prometheus at the end of time. It was published in 1896 as part of the book (&quot;Several stories&quot;).

Castro Alves, another Brazilian poet, wrote a poem named &quot;&quot; (&quot;Ahasverus and the genie&quot;), in a reference to the Wandering Jew.

The Hungarian poet János Arany also wrote a ballad called (&quot;The Eternal Jew&quot;).

The Slovenian poet Anton Aškerc wrote a poem called (&quot;Ahasverus&#x27; Temple&quot;).

The Spanish military writer José Gómez de Arteche&#x27;s novel (&quot;A Spanish soldier of twenty centuries&quot;) (1874–1886) depicts the Wandering Jew as serving in the Spanish military of different periods.

===20th century===
====Latin America====
In Mexican writer Mariano Azuela&#x27;s 1920 novel set during the Mexican Revolution, &quot;The Underdogs&quot; (), the character Venancio, a semi-educated barber, entertains the band of revolutionaries by recounting episodes from &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot;, one of two books he had read.

In Argentina, the topic of the Wandering Jew has appeared several times in the work of Enrique Anderson Imbert, particularly in his short-story (&quot;The Grimoire&quot;), included in the eponymous book.

Chapter XXXVII, , in the collection of short stories, , by the Argentine writer Manuel Mujica Láinez also centres round the wandering of the Jew.

The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges named the main character and narrator of his short story &quot;The Immortal&quot; Joseph Cartaphilus (in the story he was a Roman military tribune who gained immortality after drinking from a magical river and dies in the 1920s).

In &quot;Green Mansions&quot;, W. H. Hudson&#x27;s protagonist Abel references Ahasuerus, as an archetype of someone, like himself, who prays for redemption and peace, while condemned to walk the earth.

In 1967, the Wandering Jew appears as an unexplained magical realist townfolk legend in Gabriel García Márquez&#x27;s &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;. In his short story, “One Day After Saturday,” the character Father Anthony Isabel claims to encounter the Wandering Jew again in the mythical town of Macondo.

Colombian writer Prospero Morales Pradilla, in his novel (&quot;The sins of Ines de Hinojosa&quot;), describes the famous Wandering Jew of Tunja that has been there since the 16th century. He talks about the wooden statue of the Wandering Jew that is in Santo Domingo church and every year during the holy week is carried around on the shoulders of the Easter penitents around the city. The main feature of the statue are his eyes; they can express the hatred and anger in front of Jesus carrying the cross.

====Brazil====

In 1970, Polish-Brazilian writer Samuel Rawet published (&quot;Travels of Ahasverus to foreign lands in search of a past that does not exist because it is a future and a future that has already passed because it was dreamed&quot;), a short story in which the main character, Ahasverus, or The Wandering Jew, is capable of transforming into various other figures.

====France====

Guillaume Apollinaire parodies the character in in his
collection (&quot;Heresiarch &amp; Co.&quot;, 1910).

Jean d&#x27;Ormesson wow in (1991).

In Simone de Beauvoir&#x27;s novel (&quot;All Men are Mortal&quot;, 1946), the leading figure Raymond Fosca undergoes a fate similar to the wandering Jew, who is explicitly mentioned as a reference.

====Germany====

In both Gustav Meyrink&#x27;s &quot;The Green Face&quot; (1916) and Leo Perutz&#x27;s &quot;The Marquis of Bolibar&quot; (1920), the Wandering Jew features as a central character.
The German writer Stefan Heym in his novel (translated into English as &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot;) maps a story of Ahasuerus and Lucifer ranging between ancient times, the Germany of Luther and socialist East Germany. In Heym&#x27;s depiction, the Wandering Jew is a highly sympathetic character.

====Belgium====

The Belgian writer August Vermeylen published in 1906 a novel called (&quot;The Wandering Jew&quot;).

====Romania====

Mihai Eminescu, an influential Romanian Romantic writer, depicts a variation in his 1872 fantasy novella Poor Dionysus (). A student named Dionis goes on a surreal journey through the book of Zoroaster, which seemingly grants him godlike abilities. The book is given to him by Ruben, his Jewish master who is a philosopher. Dionis awakens as Friar Dan, and is eventually tricked by Ruben, being sentenced by God to a life of insanity. This he can only escape by resurrection or metempsychosis.

Similarly, Mircea Eliade presents in his novel &quot;Dayan&quot; (1979) a student&#x27;s mystic and fantastic journey through time and space under the guidance of the Wandering Jew, in the search of a higher truth and of his own self.

====Russia====

The Soviet satirists Ilya Ilf and Yevgeni Petrov had their hero Ostap Bender tell the story of the Wandering Jew&#x27;s death at the hands of Ukrainian nationalists in &quot;The Little Golden Calf&quot;. In Vsevolod Ivanov&#x27;s story &quot;Ahasver&quot; a strange man comes to a Soviet writer in Moscow in 1944, introduces himself as &quot;Ahasver the cosmopolite&quot; and claims he is Paul von Eitzen, a theologian from Hamburg, who concocted the legend of the Wandering Jew in the 16th century to become rich and famous but then turned himself into a real Ahasver against his will. The novel &quot;Overburdened with Evil&quot; (1988) by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky involves a character in modern setting who turns out to be Ahasuerus, identified at the same time in a subplot with John the Divine. In the novel &quot;Going to the Light&quot; (, 1998) by Sergey Golosovsky, Ahasuerus turns out to be Apostle Paul, punished (together with Moses and Mohammed) for inventing false religion.

The 1979 Korean novel &quot;Son of Man&quot; by Yi Mun-yol (introduced and translated into English by Brother Anthony, 2015), is framed within a detective story. It describes the character of Ahasuerus as a defender of humanity against unreasonable laws of the Jewish god, Yahweh. This leads to his confrontations with Jesus and withholding of aid to Jesus on the way to Calvary. The unpublished manuscript of the novel was written by a disillusioned theology student, Min Yoseop, who has been murdered. The text of the manuscript provides clues to solving the murder. There are strong parallels between Min Yoseop and Ahasuerus, both of whom are consumed by their philosophical ideals.

====Sweden====

In Pär Lagerkvist&#x27;s 1956 novel &quot;The Sibyl&quot;, Ahasuerus and a woman who was once the Delphic Sibyl each tell their stories, describing how an interaction with the divine damaged their lives. Lagerkvist continued the story of Ahasuerus in (&quot;The Death of Ahasuerus&quot;, 1960).

====Ukraine====
In Ukrainian legend, there is a character of Marko Pekelnyi (Marko of Hell, Marko the Infernal) or Marko the Accursed. This character is based on the archetype of the Wandering Jew. The origin of Marko&#x27;s image is also rooted in the legend of the traitor Mark, who struck Christ with an iron glove before his death on the cross, for which God punished him by forcing him to eternally walk underground around a pillar, not stopping even for a minute; he bangs his head against a pillar from time to time, disturbs even hell and its master with these sounds and complains that he cannot die. Another explanation for Mark&#x27;s curse is that he fell in love with his own sister, then killed her along with his mother, for which he was punished by God.

Ukrainian authors Oleksa Storozhenko, Lina Kostenko, Ivan Malkovych and others have written prose and poetry about Marko the Infernal. Also, Les Kurbas Theatre made a stage performance &quot;Marko the Infernal, or the Easter Legend&quot; based on the poetry of Vasyl Stus.

====United Kingdom====

Bernard Capes&#x27; story &quot;The Accursed Cordonnier&quot; (1900) depicts the Wandering Jew as a figure of menace.

Robert Nichols&#x27; novella &quot;Golgotha &amp; Co.&quot; in his collection &quot;Fantastica&quot; (1923) is a satirical tale where the Wandering Jew is a successful businessman who subverts the Second Coming.

In Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Helena&quot;, the Wandering Jew appears in a dream to the protagonist and shows her where to look for the Cross, the goal of her quest.

J. G. Ballard&#x27;s short story &quot;The Lost Leonardo&quot;, published in &quot;The Terminal Beach&quot; (1964), centres on a search for the Wandering Jew. The Wandering Jew is revealed to be Judas Ischariot, who is so obsessed with all known depictions of the crucifixion that he travels all around the world to steal them from collectors and museums, replacing them with forged duplicates. The story&#x27;s first German translation, published the same year as the English original, translates the story&#x27;s title as &quot;Wanderer durch Zeit und Raum&quot; (&quot;Wanderer through Time and Space&quot;), directly referencing the concept of the &quot;eternally Wandering&quot; Jew.

The horror novel &quot;Devil Daddy&quot; (1972) by John Blackburn features the Wandering Jew.

The Wandering Jew appears as a sympathetic character in Diana Wynne Jones&#x27;s young adult novel &quot;The Homeward Bounders&quot; (1981). His fate is tied in with larger plot themes regarding destiny, disobedience, and punishment.

In Ian McDonald&#x27;s 1991 story &quot;Fragments of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria&quot; (originally published in &quot;Tales of the Wandering Jew&quot;, ed. Brian Stableford), the Wandering Jew first violates and traumatizes a little girl during the Edwardian era, where her violation is denied and explained away by Sigmund Freud analyzing her and coming to the erroneous conclusion that her signs of abuse are actually due to a case of hysteria or prudishness. A quarter of a century later, the Wandering Jew takes on the guise of a gentile éminence grise who works out the genocidal ideology and bureaucracy of the Holocaust and secretly incites the Germans into carrying it out according to his plans. In a meeting with one of the victims where he&#x27;s gloatingly telling her that she and millions of others will die, he reveals that he did it out of self-hatred.

====United States====

In O. Henry&#x27;s 1911 story &quot;The Door of Unrest&quot;, a drunk shoemaker Mike O&#x27;Bader comes to a local newspaper editor and claims to be the Jerusalem shoemaker Michob Ader who did not let Christ rest upon his doorstep on the way to crucifixion and was condemned to live until the Second Coming. However, Mike O&#x27;Bader insists he is a Gentile, not a Jew.

&quot;The Wandering Jew&quot; is the title of a short poem by Edwin Arlington Robinson which appears in his 1920 book &quot;The Three Taverns&quot;. In the poem, the speaker encounters a mysterious figure with eyes that &quot;remembered everything&quot;. He recognizes him from &quot;his image when I was a child&quot; and finds him to be bitter, with &quot;a ringing wealth of old anathemas&quot;; a man for whom the &quot;world around him was a gift of anguish&quot;. The speaker does not know what became of him, but believes that &quot;somewhere among men to-day / Those old, unyielding eyes may flash / And flinch—and look the other way.&quot;

George Sylvester Viereck and Paul Eldridge wrote a trilogy of novels &quot;My First Two Thousand Years: an Autobiography of the Wandering Jew&quot; (1928), in which Isaac Laquedem is a Roman soldier who, after being told by Jesus that he will &quot;tarry until I return&quot;, goes on to influence many of the great events of history. He frequently encounters Solome (described as &quot;The Wandering Jewess&quot;), and travels with a companion, to whom he has passed on his immortality via a blood transfusion (another attempt to do this for a woman he loved ended in her death).

&quot;Ahasver&quot;, a cult leader identified with the Wandering Jew, is a central figure in Anthony Boucher&#x27;s classic mystery novel &quot;Nine Times Nine&quot; (originally published 1940 under the name H. Holmes).

Written by Isaac Asimov in October 1956, the short story &quot;Does a Bee Care?&quot; features a highly influential character named Kane who is stated to have spawned the legends of the Walking Jew and the Flying Dutchman in his thousands of years maturing on Earth, guiding humanity toward the creation of technology which would allow it to return to its far-distant home in another solar system. The story originally appeared in the June 1957 edition of &quot;If: Worlds of Science Fiction&quot; magazine and is collected in the anthology &quot;Buy Jupiter and Other Stories&quot; (Isaac Asimov, Doubleday Science Fiction, 1975).

A Jewish Wanderer appears in &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot;, a post-apocalyptic science fiction novel by Walter M. Miller, Jr. first published in 1960; some children are heard saying of the old man, &quot;What Jesus raises up STAYS raised up&quot;, and introduces himself in Hebrew as Lazarus, implying that he is Lazarus of Bethany, whom Christ raised from the dead. Another possibility hinted at in the novel is that this character is also Isaac Edward Leibowitz, founder of the (fictional) Albertian Order of St. Leibowitz (and who was martyred for trying to preserve books from burning by a savage mob). The character speaks and writes in Hebrew and English, and wanders around the desert, though he has a tent on a mesa overlooking the abbey founded by Leibowitz, which is the setting for almost all the novel&#x27;s action. The character appears again in three subsequent novellas which take place hundreds of years apart, and in Miller&#x27;s 1997 follow-up novel, &quot;Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman&quot;.

Ahasuerus must remain on Earth after space travel is developed in Lester del Rey&#x27;s &quot;Earthbound&quot; (1963). The Wandering Jew also appears in Mary Elizabeth Counselman&#x27;s story &quot;A Handful of Silver&quot; (1967). Barry Sadler has written a series of books featuring a character called Casca Rufio Longinus who is a combination of two characters from Christian folklore, Saint Longinus and the Wandering Jew. Jack L. Chalker wrote a five-book series called &quot;The Well World Saga&quot; in which it is mentioned many times that the creator of the universe, a man named Nathan Brazil, is known as the Wandering Jew. The 10th issue of DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Secret Origins&quot; (January 1987) gave The Phantom Stranger four possible origins. In one of these explanations, the Stranger confirms to a priest that he is the Wandering Jew. Angela Hunt&#x27;s novel &quot;The Immortal&quot; (2000) features the Wandering Jew under the name of Asher Genzano.

Although he does not appear in Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s novel &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; (1973), the central character, Lazarus Long, claims to have encountered the Wandering Jew at least once, possibly multiple times, over the course of his long life. According to Lazarus, he was then using the name Sandy Macdougal and was operating as a con man. He is described as having red hair and being, in Lazarus&#x27; words, a &quot;crashing bore&quot;.

The Wandering Jew is revealed to be Judas Iscariot in George R. R. Martin&#x27;s distant-future science fiction parable of Christianity, the 1979 short story &quot;The Way of Cross and Dragon&quot;.

In the first two novels of science fiction author Dan Simmons&#x27; &quot;Hyperion Cantos&quot; (1989-1997), a central character is referred to as the Wandering Jew as he roams the galaxy in search of a cure for his daughter&#x27;s illness. In his later novel &quot;Ilium&quot; (2003), a woman who is addressed as the Wandering Jew also plays a pivotal role, acting as witness and last remaining Jew during a period where all other Jewish people have been locked away.

The Wandering Jew encounters a returned Christ in Deborah Grabien&#x27;s 1990 novel &quot;Plainsong&quot;.

===21st century===

In order to avoid eternal damnation, he must fully repent of his crime. The book of memoirs Domingos dictates in the 21st century to an anonymous transcriber narrates his own saga throughout 500 years of Brazilian history. At the end, Domingos indicates he is finally giving in as he senses the arrival of the Son of Man.

====Ireland====
Local history and legends have made reference to &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot; having haunted an abandoned watermill on the edge of Dunleer town.

====United Kingdom====

English writer Stephen Gallagher uses the Wandering Jew as a theme in his 2007 novel &quot;The Kingdom of Bones&quot;. The Wandering Jew is a character, a theater manager and actor, who turned away from God and toward depravity in exchange for long life and prosperity. He must find another person to take on the persona of the wanderer before his life ends or risk eternal damnation. He eventually does find a substitute in his protégé, Louise. The novel revolves around another character&#x27;s quest to find her and save her from her assumed damnation.

Sarah Perry&#x27;s 2018 novel &quot;Melmoth&quot; is part-inspired by the Wandering Jew and makes several references to the legend in discussing the origin of its titular character.

J. G. Ballard&#x27;s short story &quot;The Lost Leonardo&quot; features the Wandering Jew as a mysterious art thief.

====United States====

====Uzbekistan====

Uzbek writer Isajon Sulton published his novel &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot; in 2011. In this novel, the Jew does not characterize a symbol of curse; however, they appear as a human being, who is aware of God&#x27;s presence, after being cursed by Him. Moreover, the novel captures the fortune of present-day wandering Jews, created by humans using high technology.

==In art==
===19th century===

Nineteenth-century works depicting the legendary figure as the Wandering (or Eternal) Jew or as Ahasuerus (Ahasver) include:

* 1846, Wilhelm von Kaulbach, &quot;Titus destroying Jerusalem&quot;. Neue Pinakothek Munich. Commissioned from Kaulbach in 1842 and completed in 1866, it was destroyed by war damage during World War II. 
** 1836 Kaulbach&#x27;s work initially commissioned by Countess Angelina Radzwill.
** 1840 Kaulbach published a booklet of Explanations identifying the main figures. 
** 1846 finished work purchased by King Ludwig I of Bavaria for the royal collections; 1853 installed in Neue Pinakothek, Munich. 
** 1842 Kaulbach&#x27;s replica for the stairway murals of the Neues Museum, Berlin commissioned by King Frederick William IV of Prussia.
** 1866 completed.
** 1943 destroyed by war damage.
* 1848–1851, Théophile Schuler&#x27;s monumental painting &quot;The Chariot of Death&quot; features a prominent depiction of the Wandering Jew (who is driven away by Death).
* 1852, a coloured caricature was used as a cover design for the June number of the satirical , published by Charles Philipon.

* 1899, Samuel Hirszenberg, &quot;The Eternal Jew&quot;. Exhibited in Łódź, Warsaw and Paris in 1899, now in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem.

===20th century===
In another artwork, exhibited at Basel in 1901, the legendary figure with the name &quot;Der ewige Jude&quot;, &quot;The Eternal Jew&quot;, was shown redemptively bringing the Torah back to the Promised Land.

Among the paintings of Marc Chagall having a connection with the legend, one has the explicit title &quot;Le Juif Errant&quot; (1923–1925).

In his painting &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot; (1983) Michael Sgan-Cohen depicts a man with bird&#x27;s head wearing a Jewish hat, with the Hand of God pointing down from the heaven to the man. The empty chair in the foreground of the painting is a symbol of how the figure cannot settle down and is forced to keep wandering.

==In ideology (19th century and after)==

By the beginning of the eighteenth century, the figure of the &quot;Wandering Jew&quot; as a legendary individual had begun to be identified with the fate of the Jewish people as a whole. After the ascendancy of Napoleon Bonaparte at the end of the century and the emancipating reforms in European countries connected with the policy of Napoleon and the Jews, the &quot;Eternal Jew&quot; became an increasingly &quot;symbolic... and universal character&quot; as the continuing struggle for Jewish emancipation in Prussia and elsewhere in Europe in the course of the nineteenth century gave rise to what came to be referred to as &quot;the Jewish Question&quot;.

Before Kaulbach&#x27;s mural replica of his painting &quot;Titus destroying Jerusalem&quot; had been commissioned by the King of Prussia in 1842 for the projected Neues Museum, Berlin, Gabriel Riesser&#x27;s essay &quot;Stellung der Bekenner des mosaischen Glaubens in Deutschland&quot; (&quot;On the Position of Confessors of the Mosaic Faith in Germany&quot;) had been published in 1831 and the journal &quot;Der Jude, periodische Blätter für Religions und Gewissensfreiheit&quot; (&quot;The Jew, Periodical for Freedom of Religion and Thought&quot;) had been founded in 1832. In 1840 Kaulbach himself had published a booklet of Explanations identifying the main figures for his projected painting, including that of the Eternal Jew in flight as an outcast for having rejected Christ. In 1843 Bruno Bauer&#x27;s book &quot;The Jewish Question&quot; was published, where Bauer argued that religious allegiance must be renounced by both Jews and Christians as a precondition of juridical equality and political and social freedom. to which Karl Marx responded with an article by the title &quot;On the Jewish Question&quot;.

A caricature which had first appeared in a French publication in 1852, depicting the legendary figure with &quot;a red cross on his forehead, spindly legs and arms, huge nose and blowing hair, and staff in hand&quot;, was co-opted by anti-Semites. It was shown at the Nazi exhibition &quot;Der ewige Jude&quot; in Germany and Austria in 1937–1938. A reproduction of it was exhibited at Yad Vashem in 2007 (shown here).

The exhibition had been held at the Library of the German Museum in Munich from 8 November 1937 to 31 January 1938 showing works that the Nazis considered to be &quot;degenerate art&quot;. A book containing images of these works was published under the title &quot;The Eternal Jew&quot;. It had been preceded by other such exhibitions in Mannheim, Karlsruhe, Dresden, Berlin and Vienna. The works of art displayed at these exhibitions were generally executed by avant-garde artists who had become recognized and esteemed in the 1920s, but the objective of the exhibitions was not to present the works as worthy of admiration but to deride and condemn them.

==Portrayal in popular media==
===Stage===

Fromental Halévy&#x27;s opera &quot;Le Juif errant&quot;, based on the novel by Sue, was premiered at the Paris Opera (Salle Le Peletier) on 23 April 1852, and had 48 further performances over two seasons. The music was sufficiently popular to generate a &quot;Wandering Jew Mazurka&quot;, a &quot;Wandering Jew Waltz&quot;, and a &quot;Wandering Jew Polka&quot;.

A Hebrew-language play titled &quot;The Eternal Jew&quot; premiered at the Moscow Habimah Theatre in 1919 and was performed at the Habima Theatre in New York in 1926.

Donald Wolfit made his debut as the Wandering Jew in a stage adaptation in London in 1924. The play &quot;Spikenard&quot; (1930) by C. E. Lawrence, has the Jew wander an uninhabited Earth along with Judas and the Impenitent thief. Glen Berger&#x27;s 2001 play &quot;Underneath the Lintel&quot; is a monologue by a Dutch librarian who delves into the history of a book that is returned 113 years overdue and becomes convinced that the borrower was the Wandering Jew.

===Film===

There have been several films on the topic of &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot;:
* 1904 silent film called &quot;Le Juif Errant&quot; by Georges Méliès
* 1923 saw &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot;, a British silent film by Maurice Elvey from the basis of E. Temple Thurston&#x27;s play, starring Matheson Lang. The play had been produced both in Twickenham, London and on Broadway in 1921, the latter co-produced by David Belasco. The play, as well as the two films based upon it, attempts to tell the legend literally, taking the Jew from Biblical times to the Spanish Inquisition.
* Elvey also directed the sound remake &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot; (1933), with Conrad Veidt in the title role; the film was so popular it broke box office records at the time.
* In 1933, the Jewish Talking Picture Company released a Yiddish-language film entitled &quot;The Eternal Jew&quot;.
* In 1940, a propaganda pseudo-documentary film was made in Nazi Germany entitled &quot;Der ewige Jude&quot; (&quot;The Eternal Jew&quot;), reflecting Nazism&#x27;s antisemitism, linking the legend with alleged Jewish malpractices over the ages.
* Another film version of the story, made in Italy in 1948, starred Vittorio Gassman.
* In 1986 film &quot;Prison Ship: Star Slammer - The Escape - Adventures of Taura, Part 1&quot;, it begins with the wandering priest &quot;Zaal&quot;, obviously appearing like the Wandering Jew who gets killed by fascist bounty hunters.
* In 1988 film &quot;The Seventh Sign&quot; the Wandering Jew appears as Father Lucci, who identifies himself as the centuries-old Cartaphilus, Pilate&#x27;s porter, who took part in the scourging of Jesus before his crucifixion.
*The 1993 film &quot;Needful Things&quot;, based on the 1991 novel of the same name by Stephen King, has elements of the Wandering Jew legend.
* The 2000 horror film &quot;Dracula 2000&quot; and its sequels equate the Wandering Jew with Judas Iscariot.
* A 2007 science fiction film &quot;The Man from Earth&quot; is similar to the Wandering Jew story in many aspects.
* The 2009 film &quot;An Education&quot; described both Graham and David Goldman this way, though Lynn Barber&#x27;s original memoirs it was based on did not.

===Television===
* In the third episode of the first season of &quot;The Librarians&quot;, the character Jenkins mentions the Wandering Jew as an &quot;immortal creature that can be injured, but never killed&quot;.
* In the third season of the FX series &quot;Fargo&quot;, a character named Paul Murrane (played by Ray Wise) appears to three major characters. He acts as a source of counsel to two of them (one of whom he provides a chance at redemption), while forcing the third to confront his past involvement in numerous killings. Though the character is widely believed to represent the Wandering Jew, the name is associated with a historical mistake: it is an anglicized version of &quot;Paolo Marana&quot; (Giovanni Paolo Marana allegedly authored &quot;Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy&quot; whose second volume features the Wandering Jew), rather than a known alias of the legendary figure.
* In the Japanese manga and accompanying anime series &quot;The Ancient Magus&#x27; Bride&quot;, the Wandering Jew is represented in the antagonist of Cartaphilus. In his search to end his eternal suffering, Cartaphilus serves as a nuisance to the progression of Chise&#x27;s training.
* In the television series &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;, Jewish gangster Alfie Solomons (played by Tom Hardy), described himself as &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot;.
* In &quot;Lagrimas&quot;, an episode of the second season of &quot;Witchblade&quot;, he is portrayed by Jeffrey Donovan as a mysterious drifter who develops a romantic relationship with protagonist Sara Pezzini. His true identity is later revealed to be the cursed Roman soldier Cartaphilus, who hopes the Witchblade can finally bring an end to his suffering.
* In the television series &quot;Rawhide&quot; the Wandering Jew features in the episode &quot;Incident of the Wanderer&quot; (Season 6, episode 21).
* In the television adaptation of &quot;The Sandman&quot;, in reference to a meeting of the characters Morpheus and Hob Gadling, Johanna Constantine remarks on a rumor that the Devil (Morpheus) and the Wandering Jew (Hob) meet once every hundred years in a tavern.

===Comics===

In Arak: Son of Thunder issue 8, the titular character encounters the Wandering Jew. Arak intervenes on behalf of a mysterious Jewish man who is about to be stoned by the people of a village. Later on, that same individual serves as a guide through the Catacombs of Rome as they seek out the lair of the Black Pope, who holds Arak&#x27;s allies hostage. His name is given as Josephus and he tells Arak that he is condemned to wander the Earth after mocking Christ en route to the crucifixion.

The DC Comics character Phantom Stranger, a mysterious hero with paranormal abilities, was given four possible origins in an issue of &quot;Secret Origins&quot; with one of them identifying him as the Wandering Jew. He now dedicates his time to helping mankind, even declining a later offer from God to release him from his penance.

In Deitch&#x27;s &quot;A Shroud for Waldo&quot;, serialized in weekly papers such as &quot;New York Press&quot; and released in book form by Fantagraphics, the hospital attendant who revives Waldo as a hulking demon so he can destroy the AntiChrist, is none other than the Wandering Jew. For carrying out this mission, he is awarded a normal life and, it is implied, marries the woman he just rescued. Waldo, having reverted to cartoon cat form, is also rewarded, finding it in a freight car.

In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot; comic series, the character Hob Gadling represents the archetypal Wandering Jew.

In Kore Yamazaki&#x27;s manga &quot;The Ancient Magus&#x27; Bride&quot;, the character Cartaphilus, also known as Joseph, is a mysterious being that looks like a young boy, but is much older. He is dubbed &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot; and is said to have been cursed with immortality for throwing a rock at the Son of God. It is later revealed that Joseph and Cartaphilus used to be two different people until Joseph fused with Cartaphilus in an attempt to remove his curse, only to become cursed himself.

In chapter 24 (titled &quot;Immortality&quot;) of Katsuhisa Kigitsu&#x27;s manga &quot;Franken Fran&quot;, the main character Fran discovers a man who can&#x27;t die. Once the man is allowed to write he reveals he is in fact The Wandering Jew.

In &quot;Raqiya: The New Book of Revelation Series&quot; by Masao Yajima and Boichi, the main character has multiple encounters with a man who is seeking to die but unable to. Initially called Mr Snow, he later reveals his identity as The Wandering Jew.

In the Wildstorm comic book universe, a man named Manny Weiss is revealed to be The Wandering Jew. He is one of a handful of sentient beings still alive billions of years in the future to witness the heat death of the universe.

==Plants==
Various types of plants are called by the common name &quot;wandering Jew&quot;, apparently because of these plants&#x27; ability to resist gardener&#x27;s attempt to prevent them from &quot;wandering over the earth until the second coming of Christ&quot; (see ). In 2016, to avoid anti-Semitism, the name &quot;wandering dude&quot; to describe &quot;Tradescantia&quot; has been proposed in an online plant community by Pedram Navid, instead of &quot;Wandering Jew&quot; and &quot;silver inch plant&quot;.

<text>Dagr (Old Norse &#x27;day&#x27;) is the divine personification of the [[day]] in Norse mythology. He appears in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, Dagr is stated to be the son of the god Dellingr and is associated with the bright-maned horse Skinfaxi, who &quot;draw[s] day to mankind&quot;. Depending on manuscript variation, the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; adds that Dagr is either Dellingr&#x27;s son by Nótt, the personified night, or Jörð, the personified Earth. Otherwise, Dagr appears as a common noun simply meaning &quot;day&quot; throughout Old Norse works. Connections have been proposed between Dagr and other similarly named figures in Germanic mythology.

==Eddaic Dagr==

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
Dagr is mentioned in stanzas 12 and 25 of the poem &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;. In stanza 24, the god Odin (disguised as &quot;Gagnráðr&quot;) asks the jötunn Vafþrúðnir from where the day comes, and the night and its tides. In stanza 25, Vafþrúðnir responds:

:Delling hight he who the day&#x27;s father is,
:but night was of Nörvi born;
:the new and waning moons the beneficent powers created,
:to count the years for men.
In stanza 12, the horse Skinfaxi, his mane gleaming, is stated by Vafþrúðnir as &quot;drawing day to mankind&quot;.

In &quot;Sigrdrífumál&quot;, after the valkyrie Sigrdrífa is woken from her sleep curse by the hero Sigurd, Sigurd asks her name, and she gives him a &quot;memory-drink&quot; of a drinking horn full of mead, and then Sigrdrifa says a prayer. The first verse of this prayer features a reference to the &quot;sons of Dagr&quot; and the &quot;female relative&quot; (&quot;nipt&quot;, &quot;niece&quot; or &quot;daughter&quot;) of Nótt.

In the poem &quot;Hrafnagaldr Óðins&quot;, the appearance of Dagr and his horse and chariot are described:

:The son of Delling
:urged on his horse
:adorned with
:precious jewels.
:Over Mannheim shines
:the horse&#x27;s mane,
:the steed Dvalin&#x27;s deluder
:dew in his chariot.
===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Dagr is again personified. In chapter 10, the enthroned figure of High states that Dagr is the son of the couple of Dellingr of the Æsir and his wife Nótt (&quot;night&quot;). Dagr is described as &quot;as bright and beautiful as his father&#x27;s people&quot;. Odin took Dagr and his mother Nótt, gave them each a chariot and a horse — Dagr receiving the horse Skinfaxi, whose mane illuminates all the sky and the Earth — and placed them in the sky to ride around the Earth every 24 hours.

Dagr is again personified in chapter 24 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, where he is stated as a brother of Jörð. As a common noun, Dagr appears in chapter 58, where &quot;Skinfaxi or Glad&quot; is stated as pulling forth the day, and chapter 64, where Dagr is stated as one of various words for time.

However, scholar Haukur Thorgeirsson points out that the four manuscripts of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; vary in their descriptions of the family relations between Nótt, Jörð, Dagr, and Dellingr. In other words, depending on the manuscript, either Jörð or Nótt is the mother of Dagr and partner of Dellingr. Haukur details that &quot;the oldest manuscript, U, offers a version where Jǫrð is the wife of Dellingr and the mother of Dagr while the other manuscripts, R, W and T, cast Nótt in the role of Dellingr&#x27;s wife and Dagr&#x27;s mother&quot;, and argues that &quot;the version in U came about accidentally when the writer of U or its antecedent shortened a text similar to that in RWT. The results of this accident made their way into the Icelandic poetic tradition&quot;.

==Svipdagr==

Otto Höfler theorized that Dagr may be related to (or may be the same figure as) the hero Svipdagr (whose name means &quot;the suddenly dawning day&quot;) who is attested in various texts. Among other sources, this figure is found in two poems compiled together and known as &quot;Svipdagsmál&quot; in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, the Prologue to the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, and by the name Swæfdæg in the mythical genealogies of the Anglian houses of Anglo-Saxon England. Otto Höfler also proposed that Svipdagr may have been a &quot;Dagr of the Suebi&quot;, and because of the names of his family members, Sólbjartr (&quot;the sun-light&quot;, indicating a potential god of the skies) and Gróa (&quot;growth&quot;, indicating a possible goddess of growth), and his wooing of Menglöð (often identified with the goddess Freyja), he further suggested that Svipdagr may have been a fertility god.

<text>A talk show is a television programming, radio programming or podcast genre structured around the act of spontaneous conversation. A talk show is distinguished from other television programs by certain common attributes. In a talk show, one person (or group of people or guests) discusses various topics put forth by a talk show host. This discussion can be in the form of an interview or a simple conversation about important social, political or religious issues and events. The personality of the host shapes the tone and style of the show. A common feature or unwritten rule of talk shows is to be based on &quot;fresh talk&quot;, which is talk that is spontaneous or has the appearance of spontaneity.

The history of the talk show spans back from the 1950s to the present.

Talk shows can also have several different subgenres, which all have unique material and can air at different times of the day via different avenues.

== Attributes ==
Beyond the inclusion of a host, a guest(s), and a studio or call-in audience, specific attributes of talk shows may be identified:
* Talk shows focus on the viewers—including the participants calling in, sitting in a studio or viewing from online or on TV.
* Talk shows center around the interaction of guests with opposing opinions and/or differing levels of expertise, which include both experts and non-experts.
* Although talk shows include guests of various expertise levels, they often cater to the credibility of one&#x27;s life experiences as opposed to educational expertise.
* Talk shows involve a host responsible for furthering the agenda of the show by mediating, instigating and directing the conversation to ensure the purpose is fulfilled. The purpose of talk shows is to either address or bring awareness to conflicts, to provide information, or to entertain.
* Talk shows consist of evolving episodes that focus on differing perspectives in respect to important issues in society, politics, religion or other popular areas.
* Talk shows are produced at low cost and are typically not aired during prime time.
* Talks shows are either aired live or are recorded live with limited post-production editing.

==Subgenres==

There are several major formats of talk shows. Generally, each subgenre predominates during a specific programming block during the broadcast day.

* Breakfast chat or early morning shows that generally alternate between news summaries, political coverage, feature stories, celebrity interviews, and musical performances.
* Late morning chat shows that feature two or more hosts or a celebrity panel and focus on entertainment and lifestyle features.
* Daytime tabloid talk shows that generally feature a host, a guest or a panel of guests, and a live audience that interacts extensively with the host and guests. These shows may feature celebrities, political commentators, or &quot;ordinary&quot; people who present unusual or controversial topics.
* &quot;Lifestyle&quot; or self-help programs that generally feature a host or hosts of medical practitioners, therapists, or counselors and guests who seek intervention, describe medical or psychological problems, or offer advice. An example of this type of subgenre is &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, although it can easily fit into other categories as well.
* Evening panel discussion shows that focus on news, politics, or popular culture (such as the former British series &quot;After Dark&quot; which was broadcast &quot;late-night&quot;).
* Late-night talk shows that focus primarily on topical comedy and variety entertainment. Most traditionally open with a monologue by the host, with jokes relating to current events. Other segments typically include interviews with celebrity guests, recurring comedy sketches, as well as performances by musicians or other stand-up comics.
* Sunday morning talk shows are a staple of network programming in North America and generally focus on political news and interviews with elected political figures and candidates for office, commentators, and journalists.
* Aftershows that feature in-depth discussion about a program on the same network that aired just before (for example, &quot;Talking Dead&quot;).
* Spoof talk shows, such as &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, &quot;Tim and Eric Nite Live&quot;, &quot;Comedy Bang! Bang!&quot;, and &quot;The Eric Andre Show&quot;, that feature interviews that are mostly scripted, shown in a humorous and satirical way, or engages in subverting the norms of the format (particularly that of late-night talk shows).

These formats are not absolute; some afternoon programs have similar structures to late-night talk shows. These formats may vary across different countries or markets. Late night talk shows are especially significant in the United States. Breakfast television is a staple of British television. The daytime talk format has become popular in Latin America as well as the United States.

These genres also do not represent &quot;generic&quot; talk show genres. &quot;Generic&quot; genres are categorized based on the audiences&#x27; social views of talks shows derived through their cultural identities, fondness, preferences and character judgements of the talk shows in question. The subgenres listed above are based on television programming and broadly defined based on the TV guide rather than on the more specific categorizations of talk show viewers. However, there is a lack of research on &quot;generic&quot; genres, making it difficult to list them here. According to Mittell, &quot;generic&quot; genres is of significant importance in further identifying talk show genres because with such differentiation in cultural preferences within the subgenres, a further distinction of genres would better represent and target the audience. 

Talk-radio host Howard Stern also hosted a talk show that was syndicated nationally in the US, then moved to satellite radio&#x27;s Sirius. The tabloid talk show genre, pioneered by Phil Donahue in 1967 but popularized by Oprah Winfrey, was extremely popular during the last two decades of the 20th century. 

Politics are hardly the only subject of American talk shows, however. Other radio talk show subjects include &quot;Car Talk&quot; hosted by NPR and &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; hosted by Art Bell and George Noory which discusses topics of the paranormal, conspiracy theories, and fringe science. Sports talk shows are also very popular ranging from high-budget shows like &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot; to Max Kellerman&#x27;s original public-access television cable TV show &quot;Max on Boxing&quot;.

==History==
Talk shows have been broadcast on television since the earliest days of the medium. Joe Franklin, an American radio and television personality, hosted the first television talk show. The show began in 1951 on WJZ-TV (later WABC-TV) and moved to WOR-TV (later WWOR-TV) from 1962 to 1993.

NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; is the world&#x27;s longest-running talk show; having debuted in 1954, it continues to this day. The show underwent some minor title changes until settling on its current title in 1962, and despite a brief foray into a more news-style program in 1957 and then reverting that same year, it has remained a talk show. Ireland&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; is the second-longest running talk show in television history, and the longest running talk show in Europe, having debuted in 1962.

Steve Allen was the first host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, which began as a local New York show, being picked up by the NBC network in 1954. It in turn had evolved from his late-night radio talk show in Los Angeles. Allen pioneered the format of late night network TV talk shows, originating such talk show staples as an opening monologue, celebrity interviews, audience participation, and comedy bits in which cameras were taken outside the studio, as well as music, although the series&#x27; popularity was cemented by second host Jack Paar, who took over after Allen had left and the show had ceased to exist.
TV news pioneer Edward R. Murrow hosted a talk show entitled &quot;Small World&quot; in the late 1950s and since then, political TV talk shows have predominantly aired on Sunday mornings.

Syndicated daily talk shows began to gain more popularity during the mid-1970s and reached their height of popularity with the rise of the tabloid talk show. Morning talk shows gradually replaced earlier forms of programming — there were a plethora of morning game shows during the 1960s and early to mid-1970s, and some stations formerly showed a morning movie in the time slot that many talk shows now occupy.

Current late night talk shows such as &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Conan&quot; and &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; have aired featuring celebrity guests and comedy sketches. Syndicated daily talk shows range from tabloid talk shows, such as &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; and &quot;Maury,&quot; to celebrity interview shows, like &quot;Live with Kelly and Ryan&quot;, &quot;Tamron Hall&quot;, &quot;Sherri&quot;, &quot;Steve Wilkos&quot;, &quot;The Jennifer Hudson Show&quot; and &quot;The Kelly Clarkson Show,&quot; to industry leader &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show,&quot; which popularized the former genre and has been evolving towards the latter. On November 10, 2010, Oprah Winfrey invited several of the most prominent American talk show hosts - Phil Donahue, Sally Jessy Raphael, Geraldo Rivera, Ricki Lake, and Montel Williams - to join her as guests on her show. The 1990s in particular saw a spike in the number of &quot;tabloid&quot; talk shows, most of which were short-lived and are now replaced by a more universally appealing &quot;interview&quot; or &quot;lifestyle TV&quot; format.

Talk shows have more recently started to appear on Internet radio. Also, several Internet blogs are in talk show format including the Baugh Experience.

The current world record for the longest talk show is held by Rabi Lamichhane from Nepal by staying on air
for 62 hours from April 11 to 13, 2013 breaking the previous record set by two Ukrainians by airing the show for 52 hours in 2011.

In 2020, the fear of the spread of the coronavirus led to large changes in the operation of talk shows, with many being filmed without live audiences to ensure adherence to the rules of social distancing. The inclusion of a live, participating audience is one of the attributes that contribute to the defining characteristics of talk shows. Operating without the interaction of viewers created difficult moments and awkward silences to hosts who usually used audience responses to transition conversations.

==Talk shows around the world==

===Japan===

 is a talk show hosted by Tetsuko Kuroyanagi and broadcast on TV Asahi from February 2, 1976, every Monday to Friday from 13:00 to 13:30 (JST). It is a long-lived program, and as of 2022, it has been broadcast for 47 years and more than 11,000 times, repeatedly winning Guinness World Records. Other talk shows include Nichiyō Tōron (1994 onwards), Ametalk! (2003 onwards) and Takeda Tetsuya no Shōwa wa kagayaiteita (2013 onwards).

In Japan, panel shows called &quot;tōku bangumi&quot; (トーク番組) are very commonplace, accounting for about 30% of daytime and prime-time programming on the four main television stations. Due to language and cultural differences, Japanese TV stations could not freely use syndicated programs (mostly from Europe and North America) and therefore turned to panel shows, which could be produced cheaply and easily, to fill time during daytime programming.

Japanese panel shows are distinct in generally not employing regular panelists but instead having a panel made up of different freelance comedians and celebrities each program, although the program is generally hosted by the same compere. Talk shows evolved in tandem with the Japanese variety show and it is very common for talk shows to borrow variety elements, typically by having celebrity guests attempt some kind of amusingly incongruous activity. Often, one of the guests will be a &quot;gaijin tarento&quot; (foreign talent) in order to provide comedy or to comment on matters related to Western culture. Comedic material is commonly written and rehearsed before tapings with or without a live audience.

===South Korea and Taiwan===
Korean and Taiwanese talk shows have used the panel format similar to Japanese programs and rely on famous celebrities and comedic banter than topics. Their programs often shorten interviews from lengthy tapings.

===Nepal===

Rabi Lamichhane from Nepal previously held the Guinness World Record for longest talk show, continuously broadcasting for 62 hours in April 2013.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, Jô Soares inaugurated the genre with Jô Soares Onze e Meia (&quot;Jô Soares Eleven Thirty&quot;) from 1988 to 1999 on SBT. In 2000, Soares took his show&#x27;s format to TV Globo, where it was then called Programa do Jô, and was broadcast until 2016. Jô&#x27;s main competitors at the time were Danilo Gentili and Fábio Porchat.

=== China ===
In 1999, &quot;Speak Up&quot;, hosted by Ma Dong, son of the famous Chinese comedian Ma Ji, was born as an early talk show &quot;chatting&quot; about a variety of sharp topics related to people&#x27;s livelihoods, the state system, and power structures. The show was eventually taken off the air as a direct result of the last episode of &quot;Approaching Homosexuality.&quot;

In 2012, Dragon Television created a new high-end cultural, American-style talk show called &quot;Tonight 80&#x27;s Talk Show&quot;; it is hosted by the comedian Wang Zijian, showing young people&#x27;s attitudes and thoughts on social hotspots, cultural events, and fashion trends.

<text>In Norse mythology, Skinfaxi (Old Norse: ) and Hrímfaxi are the horses of Dagr (day) and Nótt (night). The names Skinfaxi and Hrímfaxi mean &quot;shining mane&quot; and &quot;frost mane&quot;, respectively. Skinfaxi pulls Dagr&#x27;s chariot across the sky every day and his mane lights up the sky and earth below. Similarly, &quot;froth&quot; is believed to fall from Hrímfaxi&#x27;s bit to the earth and become dew.

<text>In Norse mythology, Dellingr (Old Norse possibly &quot;the dayspring&quot; or &quot;shining one&quot;) is a god. Dellingr is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, Dellingr is described as the father of Dagr, the personified day. The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; adds that, depending on manuscript variation, he is either the third husband of Nótt, the personified night, or the husband of Jörð, the personified earth. Dellingr is also attested in the legendary saga &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot;. Scholars have proposed that Dellingr is the personified dawn and his name may appear both in an English surname and place name.

==Attestations==

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
Dellingr is referenced in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poems &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot; and &quot;Hávamál&quot;. In stanza 24 of &quot;Vafþrúðnismá&quot;, the god Odin (disguised as &quot;Gagnráðr&quot;) asks the jötunn Vafþrúðnir from where the day comes, and the night and its tides. In stanza 25, Vafþrúðnir responds:

:Delling hight he who the day&#x27;s father is, but
:night was of Nörvi born; the new and waning moons the
:beneficent powers created, to count the years for men.

In &quot;Hávamál&quot;, the dwarf Þjóðrœrir is stated as having recited an unnamed spell &quot;before Delling&#x27;s doors&quot;:

:For the fifteenth I know what the dwarf Thiodreyrir
:sang before Delling&#x27;s doors.
:Strength he sang to the Æsir, and to the Alfar prosperity,
:wisdom to Hroptatyr.

In the poem &quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot;, Svipdagr asks &quot;What one of the gods has made so great the hall I behold within?&quot; Fjölsviðr responds with a list of names, including &quot;Dellingr&quot;. In a stanza of the poem &quot;Hrafnagaldr Óðins&quot;, the appearance of Dagr, horse, and chariot are described, and Dagr himself is referred to as &quot;the son of Delling.&quot;

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
In chapter 10 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, the enthroned figure of High states that Dellingr is a god and the third husband of Nótt. The couple have Dagr, who carries the features of his &quot;father&#x27;s people&quot;, which are described as &quot;bright and beautiful&quot;. Odin placed both Dellingr&#x27;s son, Dagr, and Dellingr&#x27;s wife, Nótt, in the sky, so that they may ride across it with their horses and chariots every 24 hours.

However, scholar Haukur Thorgeirsson points out that the four manuscripts of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; vary in their descriptions of the family relations between Nótt, Jörð, Dagr, and Dellingr. In other words, depending on the manuscript, either Jörð or Nótt is the mother of Dagr and partner of Dellingr. Haukur details that &quot;the oldest manuscript, U, offers a version where Jǫrð is married to Dellingr and the mother of Dagr while the other manuscripts, R, W and T, cast Nótt in the role of Dellingr&#x27;s wife and Dagr&#x27;s mother&quot;, and argues that &quot;the version in U came about accidentally when the writer of U or its antecedent shortened a text similar to that in RWT. The results of this accident made their way into the Icelandic poetic tradition&quot;.

===&quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot;===
Five riddles found in the poem &quot;Heiðreks gátur&quot; contained in the legendary saga &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot; employ the phrase &quot;Delling&#x27;s doors&quot; (Old Norse &quot;Dellings durum&quot;) once each. As an example, in one stanza where the phrase is used Gestumblindi (Odin in disguise) poses the following riddle:

:What strange marvel
:did I see without,
:in front of Delling&#x27;s door;
:its head turning
:to Hel downward,
:but its feet ever seek the sun?
:This riddle ponder,
:O prince Heidrek!
&#x27;Your riddle is good, Gestumblindi,&#x27; said the king; &#x27;I have guessed it. It is the leek; its head is fast in the ground, but it forks as it grows up.&#x27;
==Theories==
Jacob Grimm states that Dellingr is the assimilated form of &quot;Deglingr&quot;, which includes the name of Dellingr&#x27;s son Dagr. Grimm adds that if the &quot;-ling&quot; likely refers to descent, and that due to this Dellingr may have been the &quot;progenitor Dagr before him&quot; or that the succession order has been reversed, which Grimm states often occurs in old genealogies. Benjamin Thorpe says that Dellingr may be dawn personified, similarly to his son Dagr, the personified day.

Regarding the references to &quot;Delling&#x27;s door&quot; as used in &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot;, Christopher Tolkien says that:

:What this phrase meant to the maker of these riddles is impossible to say. In &quot;Hávamál&quot; 160 it is said that the dwarf Thjódrørir sang before Delling&#x27;s doors, which (as Delling is the father of Dag (Day) in &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot; 25) may mean that he gave warning to his people that the sun was coming up, and they must return to their dark houses; the phrase would then virtually mean &#x27;at sunrise.&#x27; As regarding &quot;dǫglings&quot; for &quot;Dellings&quot; in &quot;H&quot;, and &quot;Dǫglingar&quot; were the descendants of &quot;Dagr&quot; (according to &quot;SnE&quot;. 183).
John Lindow says that some confusion exists about the reference to Dellingr in &quot;Hávamál&quot;. Lindow says that &quot;Dellingr&#x27;s doors&quot; may either be a metaphor for sunrise or the reference may refer to the dwarf of the same name.

The English family name &quot;Dallinger&quot; has been theorized as deriving from &quot;Dellingr&quot;. The English place name Dalbury (south of Derbyshire) derives from &quot;Dellingeberie&quot;, which itself derives from &quot;Dellingr&quot;.

<text>In Norse mythology, Nótt (Old Norse: , &quot;night&quot;) is personification of the [[night]]. In both the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, composed in the 13th century, Nótt is listed as the daughter of a figure by the name of Nörvi (with variant spellings) and is associated with the horse Hrímfaxi, while the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; features information about Nótt&#x27;s ancestry, including her three marriages. Nótt&#x27;s third marriage was to the god Dellingr and this resulted in their son Dagr, the personified day (although some manuscript variations list Jörð as Dellingr&#x27;s wife and Dagr&#x27;s mother instead). As a proper noun, the word &quot;nótt&quot; appears throughout Old Norse literature.

==Attestations==

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
In stanza 24 of the poem &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, the god Odin (disguised as &quot;Gagnráðr&quot;) asks the jötunn Vafþrúðnir from where the day comes, and the night and its tides. In stanza 25, Vafþrúðnir responds:

:Delling hight he who the day&#x27;s father is,
:but night was of Nörvi born;
:the new and waning moons the beneficent powers created,
:to count the years for men.

In stanza 14 of the &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, Odin states that the horse Hrímfaxi &quot;draws every night to the beneficent gods&quot; and that he lets foam from his bit fall every morning, from which dew comes to the valleys. In stanza 30 of the poem &quot;Alvíssmál&quot;, the god Thor asks the dwarf Alvíss to tell him what night is called in each of the nine worlds, whom &quot;Nórr&quot; birthed. Alvíss responds that night is referred as &quot;night&quot; by mankind, &quot;darkness&quot; by the gods, &quot;the masker&quot; by the mighty Powers, &quot;unlight&quot; by the jötunn, &quot;joy-of-sleep&quot; by the elves, while dwarves call her &quot;dream-Njörun&quot; (meaning &quot;dream-goddess&quot;).

In &quot;Sigrdrífumál&quot;, after the valkyrie Sigrdrífa is woken from her sleep curse by the hero Sigurd, Sigurd asks her name, and she gives him a &quot;memory-drink&quot; of a drinking horn full of mead, and then Sigrdrifa says a prayer. The first verse of this prayer features a reference to the &quot;sons of Dagr&quot; and the &quot;daughter of Nótt&quot;:

:Hail to the Day! Hail to the sons of Day!
:To Night and her daughter hail!
:With placid eyes behold us here,
:and here sitting give us victory.

:Hail to the Æsir! Hail to the Asyniur!
:Hail to the bounteous earth!
:Words and wisdom give to us noble twain,
:and healing hands while we live!
===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Nótt is again personified. In chapter 10, the enthroned figure of High states that Nótt is the daughter of a jötunn from Jötunheimr by the name of &quot;Norfi or Narfi&quot;. Nótt is described as &quot;black and swarthy&quot;, and has had three marriages. Her first marriage was with Naglfari, and the two produced a son by the name of Auðr. Nótt&#x27;s second marriage was to Annar, resulting in their daughter Jörð, the personified earth. Finally, Nótt marries the god Dellingr, and the couple have Dagr, who takes after his &quot;father&#x27;s people&quot; in brightness and fairness. Odin took Nótt and her son Dagr, placed them into the sky with a chariot and a horse each, and they ride around the Earth every 24 hours. Nótt rides before Dagr, and foam from her horse Hrímfaxi&#x27;s bit sprinkles the Earth.

However, scholar Haukur Thorgeirsson points out that the four manuscripts of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; vary in their descriptions of the family relations between Nótt, Jörð, Dagr, and Dellingr. In other words, depending on the manuscript, either Jörð or Nátt is the mother of Dagr and partner of Dellingr. Haukur details that &quot;the oldest manuscript, U, offers a version where Jǫrð is married to Dellingr and the mother of Dagr while the other manuscripts, R, W and T, cast Nótt in the role of Dellingr&#x27;s wife and Dagr&#x27;s mother&quot;, and argues that &quot;the version in U came about accidentally when the writer of U or its antecedent shortened a text similar to that in RWT. The results of this accident made their way into the Icelandic poetic tradition&quot;.

In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, means of referring to Jörð are provided, including &quot;daughter of Nótt&quot;. Chapter 58 states that &quot;Hrimfaxi or Fiorsvartnir draw the night&quot;, and in chapter 64, &quot;nótt&quot; is stated as one of various words for time and a version of the &quot;Alvíssmál&quot; passage is cited.

<text>In Norse mythology, according to the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Annar (Old Norse Annarr &#x27;second, another&#x27;) is the father of Jörð (Mother Earth) by Nótt (the Night). The form Ónar (Old Norse Ónarr &#x27;gaping&#x27;) is found as a variant. 

Annar/Ónar is also the name of a dwarf in the catalogue of dwarfs in the &quot;Völuspá&quot; that is repeated in the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;. 

==Attestations==
In the pseudo-historical genealogy of Odin&#x27;s ancestors in the introduction to Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, a certain Athra is said to be he &quot;whom we call Annar&quot;. What this refers to is unknown. (See Sceafa for discussion of the section of this genealogy in which Annar appears.)

In the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; Snorri writes of Nótt:
She was given to the man named Naglfari; their son was Aud. Afterward she was wedded to him that was called Annar; Jörð [&#x27;Earth&#x27;] was their daughter.

Snorri might have been using a source in which &quot;annar&quot; &#x27;second, another&#x27; was intended to mean Odin, for he himself had just previously written of Odin: &quot;The earth was his daughter and his wife...&quot;.

But in the &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; Snorri uses the form &quot;Ónar&quot; instead, giving &quot;daughter of Ónar&quot; as one of the kennings for Jörð. Snorri also cites from Hallfreðr vandræðaskáld:
In council it was determined&lt;br&gt;
That the King&#x27;s friend, wise in counsel,&lt;br&gt;
Should wed the Land, sole daughter&lt;br&gt;
Of Ónar, greenly wooded.

<doc id="87900" wikidata="Q191346" url="?curid=87900" title="Pahang">
<text>Pahang (; Pahang Hulu Malay: &quot;Paha&quot;, Pahang Hilir Malay: &quot;Pahaeng&quot;, Ulu Tembeling Malay: &quot;Pahaq&quot;), officially Pahang Darul Makmur with the Arabic honorific &quot;Darul Makmur&quot; (&quot;The Abode of Tranquility&quot;) is a sultanate and a federal state of Malaysia. It is the third largest state in the country and the largest state in Peninsular Malaysia, and the ninth most populous. The state occupies the basin of the Pahang River, and a stretch of the east coast as far south as Endau. The state borders the Malaysian states of Kelantan and Terengganu to the north, Perak, Selangor and Negeri Sembilan to the west and Johor to the south, with the South China Sea is to the east. Pahang is separated from the west coast states by the Titiwangsa Mountains that forms a natural divider between the peninsula&#x27;s east and west coasts from north to south, and from Terengganu in the east by the Pantai Timur Range. The state&#x27;s highest elevation culminates at Mount Tahan in the eponymous Tahan Range, which is high. Although two thirds of the state is covered by dense rain forest, its central plains are intersected by numerous rivers, and along the coast there is a wide expanse of alluvial soil that includes the deltas and estuarine plains of the Kuantan, Pahang, Rompin, Endau, and Mersing Rivers.

The state is divided into 11 districts () – Pekan, Rompin, Maran, Temerloh, Jerantut, Bentong, Raub, Lipis, Cameron Highlands and Bera. The largest district is Jerantut, which is the main gateway to the Taman Negara national park. Pahang&#x27;s capital and largest city, Kuantan, is the eighth largest urban area by population in Malaysia. The royal capital and the official seat of the Sultan of Pahang is located at Pekan. Pekan was also the old state capital and its name translates literally into &#x27;the town&#x27;, it was known historically as &#x27;Inderapura&#x27;. Other major towns include Temerloh, Raub, Bentong, Jerantut, Kuala Lipis and its hill resorts of Genting Highlands, Bukit Tinggi, and Cameron Highlands. The head of state is the Sultan of Pahang, while the head of government is the &quot;Menteri Besar&quot;. The government system is closely modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system. The state religion of Pahang is Islam, but allows other religions in its territory.

Archaeological evidence shows that humans have inhabited the area that is now Pahang since as early as the Paleolithic age. The early settlements gradually developed into an ancient maritime trading state by the 3rd century. In the 5th century, the Old Pahang Kingdom sent envoys to the Liu Song court. During the time of Langkasuka, Srivijaya and Ligor, Pahang was one of the outlying dependencies. In the 15th century, the Pahang Sultanate became an autonomous kingdom within the Malacca Sultanate. Pahang entered into a dynastic union with the Johor Sultanate in the early 17th century and later emerged as an autonomous kingdom in the late 18th century. Following the bloody Pahang Civil War that concluded in 1863, the state under Tun Ahmad of the Bendahara dynasty, was eventually restored as a sultanate in 1881. In 1895, Pahang became a British protectorate along with Perak, Selangor and Negeri Sembilan. During the World War II, Pahang and other states of Malaya were occupied by the Empire of Japan from 1941 to 1945. After the war, Pahang became part of the Malayan Union before being absorbed into the Federation of Malaya which gained full independence from the British.

Modern Pahang is an economically important state with main activities in the services, manufacturing and agricultural sectors. As part of the East Coast Economic Region, it is a key region for the manufacturing sector, with the local logistics support network serving as a hub for the east coast region of Peninsular Malaysia. Over the years, the state has attracted much investment, both local and foreign, in the mineral sector. Important mineral exports include iron ore, gold, tin and bauxite. Malaysia&#x27;s substantial oil and natural gas fields lie offshore in the South China Sea. At one time, timber resources also brought much wealth to the state. Large-scale development projects have resulted in the clearing of hundreds of square miles of land for oil palm and rubber plantations and the resettling of several hundred thousand people in new villages under federal agencies and institutions like FELDA, FELCRA and RISDA.

== Etymology ==
The Khmer word for tin is pāhang (ប៉ាហាំង) and it is phonetically identical to (note that the Jawi spelling, literally, &quot;phŋ&quot;, deviates from modern Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka rules although its sound is unmistakably /paahaŋ/, note that the long ā sound is not explicitly rendered or stressed in old Jawi, just like ڤد). Since the tin mines at Sungai Lembing had been known since ancient times and that the Malay Peninsula was within the sphere of influence of Khmer civilisation, William Linehan hypothesized that the name of the state was named after the Khmer word for tin (note that tin-rich Perak is also etymologically linked to tin). 

This lexemic starting point can be used to explain other derivatives terms such as the Pahang River, Mahang the place (name given to Pahang by Jakuns), Mahang the tree (&quot;Macaranga&quot;, a common tree species in secondary forests, likely named after the toponym of the same phoneme). The Proto-Malays of Sungai Bebar who interacted with Trito-Malays likely acquired the term from their city counterparts. The theories that the state was named after the river or tree are unsatisfactory as they do not explain how the river or the tree got their names. 

There were many variations of the name Pahang outside the Malay world. For examples, Song dynasty author Zhao Rukuo 趙汝适 wrote in Zhufanzhi 諸蕃志 (circa 1225) that Phong-hong (蓬豐 romanised according to Southern Min dialect since Zhao was from Quanzhou) was a dependency of Srivijaya. The transition from Inderapura to Pahang, approximately around the Song period indicates that Khmer influence on the state was weakened and displaced by that of Srivijaya and Majapahit.

During the Yuan dynasty, Pahang was known as Phenn-Khenn 彭坑 in Daoyi Zhilue 島夷志略 (circa 1349), and in Ming Shilu 明實錄 (circa 1378), it was transliterated as Pen-Heng 湓亨, and in Haiguo Wenjianlu 海國聞見錄 (circa 1730), compiled in the Qing period, Pahang was transliterated as 邦項 (Pang-hang).

Arabs and Europeans, transliterated Pahang to &quot;Pam, Pan, Paam, Paon, Phaan, Phang, Paham, Pahan, Pahaun, Phaung, Phahangh.&quot;

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
Archaeological evidence shows that humans have inhabited the area that is now Pahang since as early as the Paleolithic. Relics of a of Mesolithic civilisation that used using paleolithic implements have been found at Gunung Senyum. Chipped Paleolithic artefacts without traces of polishing have been discovered at Sungai Lembing, Kuantan, from the remains of a 6,000 years old civilisation. Traces of Hoabinhian culture are represented by a number of limestone cave sites. Late Neolithic relics are abundant, including polished tools, quoit discs, stone ear pendants, stone bracelets and cross-hatched bark pounders. By around 400 BCE, the development of bronze casting led to the flourishing of the Đông Sơn culture, notably for its elaborate bronze war drums.

The early iron civilisation in Pahang that began around the beginning of Common Era is associated by prehistorians with the late neolithic culture. Relics from this era, found along the rivers are particularly numerous in the Tembeling Valley, which served as the old main northern highway of communication. Ancient gold workings in Pahang are thought to date back to this early Iron Age as well.

=== Hindu-Buddhist Era ===

The Kra Isthmus region of the Malay Peninsula and its peripheries are recognised by historians as the cradle of Malayic civilisations. Primordial Malayic kingdoms are described as tributaries to Funan by the 2nd century Chinese sources. Ancient settlements in Pahang can be traced from Tembeling to as far south as Merchong. Their tracks can also be found in the deep hinterland of Jelai, along the Chini Lake, and up to the head-waters of the Rompin. One such settlement was identified as &quot;Koli&quot; in &quot;Geographia&quot; or &quot;Kiu-Li&quot;, centred on the estuary of Pahang River south of Langkasuka, that flourished in the 3rd century CE. It possessed an important international port, where many foreign ships stopped to barter and resupply. In common with most of the states in the Malay Peninsula during that time, Kiu-Li was in contact with Funan. The Chinese records mention that an embassy sent to Funan by the Indian King Murunda sailed from Kiu-Li&#x27;s port (between 240 and 245 CE). Murunda presented to the Funanese King Fan Chang four horses from the Yuezhi (Kushan) stud farms.

By the middle of the 5th century, a polity suggested to be ancient Pahang, was described in the &quot;Book of Song&quot; as &quot;Pohuang&quot; or &quot;Panhuang&quot; (婆皇). The king of Pohuang, &quot;She-li Po-luo-ba-mo&quot; (&#x27;Sri Bhadravarman&#x27;), was recorded to have sent an envoy to the Liu Song court in 449–450. In 456–457, another envoy of the same country arrived at the Chinese capital, Jiankang. This ancient Pahang is believed to had been established later as a mueang to the mandala of Langkasuka-Kedah centred in modern-day Patani region that rose to prominence with the regression of Funan from the 6th century. By the beginning of the 8th century, Langkasuka-Kedah came under the military and political hegemony of Srivijaya. In the 11th century, the power vacuum left by the collapse of Srivijaya was filled by the Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom, commonly known in Malay tradition as &#x27;Ligor&#x27;. During this period, Pahang, designated as &quot;Muaeng Pahang&quot; was established as one of the twelve naksat city states of Ligor.

In the 14th century, Pahang began consolidating its influence in the southern part of the Malay Peninsula. The kingdom, described by Portuguese historian, Manuel Godinho de Erédia as &quot;Pam&quot;, was one of the two kingdoms of &quot;Malayos&quot; in the peninsula, in succession to Pattani, that flourished before the establishment of the Malacca Sultanate. The Maharaja of Pahang, was also the overlord of countries of &quot;Ujong Tanah&quot; (&#x27;land&#x27;s end&#x27;), on the southern part of the peninsula including Temasek. The Majapahit chronicle, &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot; even used the name Pahang to designate the Malay Peninsula, an indication of the importance of this kingdom. The &quot;History of Ming&quot; records several envoy missions from Pahang to the Ming court in the 14th and 15th centuries. In 1378, Maharaja Tajau sent envoys with a letter on a gold leaf and sent six foreign slaves and products of the country as tribute. In 1411, during the reign of Maharaja &quot;Pa-la-mi-so-la-ta-lo-si-ni&quot; (transliterated by historian as &#x27;Parameswara Teluk Chini&#x27;), he also sent envoys carrying tribute.

=== Old sultanate ===
The Old Pahang Sultanate centred in modern-day Pekan was established in the 15th century. At the height of its influence, the sultanate was an important power in Southeast Asia and controlled the entire Pahang basin, bordering the Pattani Sultanate to the north and the Johor Sultanate to the south. To the west, its jurisdiction extended over parts of modern-day Selangor and Negeri Sembilan.

The sultanate has its origin as a vassal to the Malacca Sultanate, with its first sultan, Muhammad Shah having been a Malaccan prince, and was the grandson of Dewa Sura, the last pre-Malaccan ruler of Pahang. Over the years, Pahang grew independent from Malaccan control and at one point even established itself as a rival to Malacca until the latter&#x27;s demise in 1511. In 1528, the last Sultan of Malacca, Mahmud Shah died. Pahang joined forces with his successor, Alauddin Riayat Shah II who established himself in Johor to expel the Portuguese from the Malay Peninsula. Two attempts were made in 1547 at Muar and in 1551 at Portuguese Malacca. However, in the face of superior Portuguese arms and vessels, the Pahang and Johor forces were forced to retreat on both occasions.

During the reign of Sultan Abdul Kadir, Pahang enjoyed a brief period of cordial relations with the Portuguese. However, this relationship was discontinued by his successor, Sultan Ahmad II. The next ruler, Sultan Abdul Ghafur attacked the Portuguese and simultaneously challenged the Dutch presence in the Strait of Malacca. Nevertheless, in 1607, Pahang not only tolerated the Dutch, but, following a visit by Admiral Matelief de Jonge, even cooperated with them in an attempt to get rid of the Portuguese.

The Sultan tried to reforge the Johor-Pahang alliance to assist the Dutch. However, a quarrel which erupted between Sultan Abdul Ghafur and Alauddin Riayat Shah III of Johor, resulted in Johor declaring war on Pahang in 1612. With the aid of Sultan Abdul Jalilul Akbar of Brunei, Pahang eventually defeated Johor in 1613. Sultan Abdul Ghafur&#x27;s son, Alauddin Riyat Shah ascended to the throne in 1614. In 1615, the Acehnese under Iskandar Muda invaded Pahang, forcing Alauddin Riayat Shah to retreat into the interior. He nevertheless continued to exercise some ruling powers. His reign in exile is considered to have officially ended after the installation of a distant relative, Raja Bujang to the Pahangese throne in 1615, with the support of the Portuguese following a pact between the Portuguese and Sultan of Johor.

Raja Bujang who reigned as Abdul Jalil Shah was eventually deposed in the Acehnese invasion in 1617, but restored to the Pahangese throne and also installed as the new Sultan of Johor following the death of his uncle, Abdullah Ma&#x27;ayat Shah in 1623. This event led to the union of the crown of Pahang and Johor, and the formal establishment of the Johor Empire.

=== Modern history ===
The modern Pahang kingdom came into existence with the consolidation of power by the Bendahara family in Pahang, following the gradual disintegration of Johor Empire. Self-rule was established in Pahang in the late 18th century, with Tun Abdul Majid declared as the first raja bendahara. The area around Pahang formed a part of the hereditary domains attached to this title and administered directly by the raja bendahara. The weakening of the Johor Sultanate and the disputed succession to the throne was coupled with the increasing independence of the Bendahara in Pahang, the Temenggong in Johor and Singapore, and the Yamtuan Muda in Riau.

In 1853, the fourth raja bendahara Tun Ali, renounced his allegiance to the Sultan of Johor and became the independent ruler of Pahang. He was able to maintain peace and stability during his reign. After his death in 1857 his younger son Wan Ahmad challenged the succession of his half-brother Tun Mutahir, in a dispute that escalated into a civil war. Supported by the neighbouring Terengganu Sultanate and the Siamese, Wan Ahmad emerged victorious, establishing control over important towns and expelled his brother in 1863. He served as the last raja bendahara, and was proclaimed Sultan of Pahang by his chiefs in 1881.

Due to internal strife within Pahang, the British pressured Sultan Ahmad to agree to the presence of a British adviser. Aided by Sultan Abu Bakar of Johor and William Fraser of the Pahang Mining Company, they succeeded in convincing Sultan Ahmad to accept a British agent, Hugh Clifford, in December 1887. In October 1888, Sultan Ahmad reluctantly accepted John Pickersgill Rodger as Pahang&#x27;s first Resident. Following the intervention, Sultan Ahmad became a Ruler-in-Council and acted in accordance with the advice of the British Resident and the State Council, except in matters pertaining Islam and Malay customs. Taxes were to be collected in the name of the sultan by the Resident, with the assistance of European officers.

Between 1890 and 1895, Dato&#x27; Bahaman, the Orang Kaya Setia Perkasa Pahlawan of Semantan, and Imam Perang Rasu, the Orang Kaya Imam Perang Indera Gajah of Pulau Tawar, led a revolt against the British encroachment. Sultan Ahmad appeared to be co-operating with the British, but he was known to be sympathetic to the dissidents. By 1895 the revolt was suppressed by the British and many of the dissidents surrendered. In July 1895, Sultan Ahmad signed the Federation Agreement, which made Pahang, along with Perak, Selangor and Negeri Sembilan, one of the Federated Malay States, a protectorate of the British Empire. This had effectively reduced the Sultan&#x27;s powers and authority, as did the creation of Federal Council in 1909. The executive and legislative functions of the State Council became increasingly nominal.

Like other Malay States, Pahang suffered during the Japanese occupation of Malaya until 1945. During the Japanese Occupation, the reigning Sultan Abu Bakar opened a large potato plantation behind the Terentang Palace to help ease the food shortage and he personally approved proposals to form the &quot;Askar Wataniah&quot;, an underground Malay resistance force. The Sultan spent the final days of the occupation in a jungle hideout with members of Force 136, resistance fighters and refugees. In late 1945, to mark the decommissioning of the Askar Wataniah, the troops paraded through Pekan and submitted to a royal inspection, after which they were honoured at the Sa&#x27;adah Palace with what has been called &#x27;the first &quot;ronggeng&quot; of the liberation&#x27;.

During his reign, Sultan Abu Bakar revived the office of State Mufti and established the Pahang Islamic and Malay Customs Council. The state&#x27;s administrative capital, which was established in Kuala Lipis during British intervention, was moved to Kuantan.

After World War II, Pahang formed the Federation of Malaya with the other eight Malay States and two British Crown Colonies, Malacca and Penang in 1948. The semi-independent Malaya was granted independence in 1957, and was then reconstituted as Malaysia with the inclusion the states of Singapore (left the federation in 1965), Sabah and Sarawak in 1963.

== Geography ==

Pahang covers an area of , and is the third largest state in Malaysia after Sabah and Sarawak, and the largest in Peninsular Malaysia. Geographically diverse, Pahang occupies the vast Pahang River basin, which is enclosed by the Titiwangsa Range to the west and the eastern highlands to the north. Although about two thirds of the state is dense jungle, its central plains are intersected by numerous rivers, joining to form the Pahang River which dominates the drainage system. Pahang is divided into three ecoregions, the freshwater systems, the lowlands and highlands rainforests and the coastline.

The Pahang River basin connects with Malaysia&#x27;s two largest natural freshwater lakes, Bera and Chini. Described as wetland of international importance, Bera Lake was accepted as Malaysia&#x27;s first Ramsar site in 1994.

The highest peak, Mount Tahan, reaches in elevation, which is also the highest point in Peninsular Malaysia. The climate is temperate enough to have distinct temperature variations year round, and much of the highlands are covered with tropical rainforest. Pahang is home to two of Malaysia&#x27;s national parks, Taman Negara and Endau-Rompin, both located in the north and south of the state respectively. These large primary rainforests are extensive, and are home to many rare or endangered animals, such as the tapir, mouse-deer, tigers, elephants and leopards. Ferns are also extremely common, mainly due to the high humidity and fog that permeates the area. Popular hill resorts located along these main highland areas are Cameron Highlands, Genting Highlands, Fraser&#x27;s Hill and Bukit Tinggi. The Cameron Highlands is home to extensive tea plantations and also a major supplier of legumes and vegetables to both Malaysia and Singapore. The largest of Felda&#x27;s palm oil plantations in Malaysia are located in the Jengka Triangle centred around the Bandar Tun Razak in Maran district.
Pahang&#x27;s long, coastline has sandy beaches like Cherating, Teluk Cempedak, Beserah, Batu Hitam and Tanjung Sepat. Also located along the coastal plain, is a wide expanse of alluvial soil that includes the deltas and estuarine plains of the Kuantan, Pahang, Rompin, Endau, and Mersing Rivers. Important economic centres can be found along the coastline, where both capital and royal capital of the state, Kuantan and Pekan, are located. About 58 km off the coast of Pahang lies Tioman Island, in the South China Sea, acclaimed as one of the best island getaways in the world.

Pahang has a tropical geography with an equatorial climate and a year-round of humidity of no less than 75%. It is warm and humid throughout the year with temperatures ranging from 21 °C to 33 °C. The rainfall here averages 200 mm monthly, a large proportion of which occurs during the northeast monsoon. Precipitation is the lowest in March, with an average of 22.25 mm. In October and November, the precipitation reaches its peak, with an average of 393 mm. The hottest month in Pahang is May when the average maximum temperature is 33°, average temperature is 28° and average minimum temperature is 24°. At highland areas, the temperature can vary from during daytime to during night time.

Pahang experiences two monsoon seasons: a northeast monsoon and a southwest monsoon. The tropical storms of the northeast monsoon wash ashore from the end of October until the beginning of March ever year, bringing heavy rainfall, powerful currents and unpredictable tempest of the monsoon season coming in from the South China Sea. The southwest monsoon, which occurs beginning March every year, brings somewhat less rainfall, with sunny and tropical weather up until the end of October.

=== Biodiversity ===
Malaysia, as a nation, is considered one of the most biodiverse on earth. Pahang maintains a protected network of managed areas rich in flora, fauna, and natural resources, in spite of deforestation, rapid industrialisation and an ever-growing population. In Pahang, there are some 74 forest reserves, including ten virgin-jungle reserves and 13 different amenity forests, wildlife reserves, national parks and offshore marine parks. There are many examples of nationally- and internationally-relevant areas, including the Krau Wildlife Reserve, Bera Lake Ramsar Site, Tioman Island Marine Park and Cameron Highlands Wildlife Sanctuary.

Total forest in Pahang is about 2,367,000 ha (66% of the land area), of which 89% is a dryland forest, 10% peat swamp forest, and 1% mangroves. About 56% of the total forest is within the Permanent Forest Estate. This includes almost the full range of forest types found in Malaysia, although some of the more unique environments (such as heath forest or forest on ultrabasic rocks) exist only in fragmented areas of Pahang. The protected forest within Taman Negara and Krau Wildlife Reserve includes small areas of extreme lowland alluvial plains. Elsewhere, most of the dryland forest in Pahang is on steep slopes, therefore benefiting from both catchment protection and slope protection functions. Virtually every species of bird and mammal found in Peninsular Malaysia has been recorded in Pahang, other than a few confined to the north of the country or the west coast. There are a large number of montane species. Peaks within Taman Negara, Mount Benom, and peaks along the Titiwangsa Range, with different endemic species in each of these montane regions are located in Pahang. The large forest blocks of the west and northeast support nationally important populations of big mammals and other fauna, and act as a unit with Taman Negara.
The Pahang River is the longest river on the peninsula, and from its headwaters to the estuary it includes virtually all of the natural river types. These range from montane streams, saraca streams and neram rivers to rasau and nipah tidal reaches. Water catchments have been defined as covering 81% of the state and more than half of this is forested. The huge network of rivers in Pahang is home to freshwater aquatic biodiversity, important to the economy of the state. Connecting to this riverine systems are a number of natural freshwater lakes, most notably Bera and Chini lakes. Surrounded by a patchwork of dry lowland dipterocarp forests, the lake environment stretches its tentacles into islands of peat swamp forests. Rich in wildlife and vegetation, the lakes provide an ecosystem which supports not only a diversity of animal and plant life, but sustains the livelihood of the Orang Asal, the aboriginal people inhabiting the wetlands.

Most of the coastline is sandy, with rocky headlands at intervals. Mangroves and nipah swamps are confined to estuaries and do not occur along the exposed coast. These estuaries can be seasonally important to fishermen when rough weather prevents fishing at sea. There are limited areas of hard and soft coral offshore, which have been mapped together with coastal features. There are many islands off the east coast, the largest being Tioman and Seri Buat islands. Besides the island populations of fauna and flora, which sometimes differ genetically from mainland forms of the same species, these islands are of value for the reefs and other bottom features which support marine biological diversity. The reefs in particular are sensitive to sedimentation from activities on land. These features are related to the maintenance of marine fisheries, an important sector of the coastal economy. Tioman, Chebeh, Tulai, Sembilang and Seri Buat islands constitute the Tioman group of islands within the Marine Parks system of Peninsular Malaysia.

== Politics and government ==



The modern constitution of Pahang, the &quot;Undang-Undang Tubuh Kerajaan Pahang&quot;, was first drafted on 1 February 1948. It was formally adopted on 25 February 1959. The constitution proclaims that Pahang is a constitutional monarchy. The constitutional head is the Sultan, who is described as &quot;the fountain head of justice and of all authority of government&quot; in the state. He who is vested with the power as a monarch of the state, is also the Head of Islam and the source of all titles and dignities, honours and awards. The current Sultan belong to the male line of the Bendahara dynasty who have been ruling the state since the 17th century. Since 2019, the reigning monarch has been Abdullah. He was proclaimed as Sultan on 15 January 2019, succeeding his father, Ahmad Shah, whose abdication was decided at a Royal Council meeting on 11 January. On 24 January 2019, days after his accession to the throne of Pahang, he was elected as the 16th Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia, succeeding Muhammad V who abdicated from the throne on 6 January. Succession order to the throne of Pahang is generally determined roughly by agnatic primogeniture. No female may become ruler, and female line descendants are generally excluded from succession. In Pahang traditional political structure, the offices of &quot;Orang Besar Berempat&quot; (&#x27;four major chiefs&#x27;) are the most important positions after the Sultan himself. The four hereditary territorial magnates are; Orang Kaya Indera Pahlawan, Orang Kaya Indera Perba Jelai, Orang Kaya Indera Segara and Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar. Next in the hierarchy were the &quot;Orang Besar Berlapan&quot; (&#x27;eight chiefs&#x27;) and &quot;Orang Besar Enam Belas&quot; (&#x27;sixteen chiefs&#x27;) who were subordinated to the principal nobles.

The Sultan headed two institutions, the State Legislative Assembly and State Executive Council. The legislative branch of the state is the unicameral &quot;Dewan Undangan Negeri&quot; (&#x27;State Legislative Assembly&#x27;) whose 42 members are elected from single-member constituencies. The assembly has the power to enact the state laws. State government is led by a Menteri Besar, who is a member of the State Legislative Assembly from the majority party. According to the constitution of Pahang, the Menteri Besar is required to be a Malay and a Muslim, appointed by the ruler from the party that commands the majority of the State Legislative Assembly. By convention, state elections are held concurrently with the federal election, held at least once every five years, the most recent of which took place in May 2018. Registered voters of age 21 and above may vote for the members for the state legislative chamber.

Executive power is vested in the State Executive Council as per 1959 constitution. It consists of the Mentri Besar, who is its chairman, and 13 other members. The Sultan of Pahang appoints the Mentri Besar and the rest of the council from the members of the State Assembly. The Mentri Besar is both the head of the Executive Council and the head of the State Government. The incumbent, Dato&#x27; Seri Wan Rosdy Wan Ismail from the United Malays National Organisation, a major component party of the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, appointed in 2018, is the 15th Mentri Besar.

As a federal state, Pahang is subjected to Malaysia&#x27;s legal system which is based on English Common Law. The highest court in the judicial system is the Federal Court, followed by the Court of Appeal and the High Court of Malaya. Malaysia also has a special court to hear cases brought by or against royalty. The death penalty is in use for serious crimes such as murder, terrorism, drug trafficking, and kidnapping. Separate from and running parallel to the civil courts, are the Syariah Court, which apply Sharia law to Muslims in the areas of family law and religious observances. As provided in Article 3 of the Federal Constitution, Syariah or Islamic law is a matter of state law, passed in the State Legislative Assembly. Matters related to the enforcement of the Syariah law falls under the jurisdiction of the &quot;Jabatan Agama Islam Pahang&quot; (&#x27;Pahang Islamic Religious Department&#x27;). Pahang&#x27;s constitution empowers the Sultan as the head of Islam and Malay customs in the state. State council known as &quot;Majlis Ugama Islam dan Adat Resam Melayu Pahang&quot; (&#x27;Council of Islam and Malay Customs of Pahang&#x27;) is responsible in advising the ruler as well as regulating both Islamic affairs and adat.

=== Subdivisions ===

Pahang is divided into 11 administrative districts, which in turn is divided into 66 mukims. Currently, there are also 4 subdistricts in Pahang, which is Genting, Gebeng, Jelai and Muadzam Shah. For each district, the state government appoints a district officer who heads lands and district office. An administrative district can be distinguished from a local government area where the former deals with land administration and revenue while the latter deals with the planning and delivery of basic infrastructure to its inhabitants. Administrative district boundaries are usually coextensive with local government area boundaries but may sometimes differ especially in urbanised areas. Local governments in Pahang consist of 3 municipal councils and 8 district councils.

The administrative divisions in Pahang are originated from the time of the old Pahang Sultanate, whereby territorial magnates appointed by the Sultan to administer the historical divisions of the state. The largest historical divisions were; Jelai (corresponds to modern day Lipis District), Temerloh, Chenor (corresponds to modern day Maran District) and Pekan, each administered by the four major chiefs (&quot;Orang Besar Berempat&quot;). Next in the hierarchy were the &quot;Orang Besar Berlapan&quot; (&#x27;eight chiefs&#x27;) and then &quot;Orang Besar Enam Belas&quot; (&#x27;sixteen chiefs&#x27;) who were subordinated to their respective principal nobles. The lowest of this traditional hierarchy are the &quot;Tok Empat&quot; or village headmen who were subordinated to &quot;Tok Mukim&quot;, who in turn subordinated to &quot;Tok Penghulu&quot;, who in turn subordinated to one of the sixteen chiefs.

In modern times, the &quot;Tok Empat&quot; became formally known as &quot;Ketua Kampung&quot; (literally &#x27;village headman&#x27;), although continued to be referred as such informally. He is subordinated to a Penghulu, the head of the mukim, who in turn subordinated to the district officer.

== Economy ==
As a federal state of Malaysia, Pahang is a relatively open state-oriented market economy. The Pahang State Government Development Corporation, established in 1965, carries the responsibility to drive the economic and social development, by attracting investments, promoting industrial, property and entrepreneurial development, and setting up new commercial hubs and townships. The federal government, through a series development initiatives and programs, the most recent is the East Coast Economic Region introduced in 2007, is also credited for the robust economic growth in recent years. With GDP growing an average 5.6 per cent annually from 1971 to 2000, Pahang is considered a developing state. In 2015, the state economy grew by 4.5%, the tenth highest among 15 states and federal territories of Malaysia, but later reduced to 2% in 2016. The GDP per capita is recorded at $7,629.39 in 2016, while the unemployment rate was maintained below 3% from 2010 to 2016. The economy of Pahang in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) at purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2016 was $12.414 billion, the eight largest in Malaysia. The amount constitutes 4.5% contribution to the national GDP, and largely driven by three main economic activities; Services (49%), Agriculture (23%), and Manufacturing (22.1%).

Historically, by the 19th century, Pahang&#x27;s economy, like in ancient times, was still heavily dependent on the export of gold. Gold mines can be found from Bera to Jelai River river basin. Systematic mining started in 1889 during British protectorate, when the Raub Australian Gold mine was established. Extensive underground mining took place in the area and this continued until 1985 during which time the mine at Raub produced nearly 1 million ounces, 85% of the production of Peninsular Malaysia. Another important article of export was tin, which was also mined in a large scale. The tin ore production was primarily concentrated at Sungai Lembing, where during its heyday, the operations saw the excavation of deep shaft mines that were among the largest, longest and deepest in the world. The growth of the mining industry had a significant impact on Pahang&#x27;s society and economy towards the end of the 19th century. Thousands of people were at work in the mines which places had, in consequence, become an important trading centres in the state. Once an important industry, the mining industry along with quarrying, now accounts only 1.6% of the total state GDP in 2016. Modern mining industry also include other minerals, in particular iron ore and bauxite. Pahang accounts for more than 70% of the Malaysia&#x27;s estimated 109.1 million tonnes of bauxite reserves. Mining of the ore, used to make aluminium, surged in 2015 after neighbouring Indonesia prohibited the raw material from being sold overseas. China, instead, bought almost 21 million tonnes from Malaysia, valued at US$955.3 million. Pahang iron ore production is concentrated at small-scale mines scattered across the state. The low grade iron ores were consumed by the pipe-coating industry that supplied the oil and gas sector and cement plants, while the high grades were exported.


The services sector, which constitutes 49% of the total Pahang GDP, is predominantly stimulated by the Wholesale and Retail Trade, Food and Beverage and Accommodation, which amounts to $1.8 billion in 2016. This sub sector, on the other hand, is the main driving factor for the growth of the tourism industry. With its richness in biodiversity, Pahang is offering ecotourism to its hill resorts, beaches and national parks. In 2014, the state attracted 9.4 million visitors, and the figure grew to 12 million in 2016. The agricultural sector is another key economic sector of the state. Historically an agrarian economy, Pahang&#x27;s agriculture was dominated by the production of vegetables, rice, yams and tubers in the past. With extensive support by the federal agencies and institutions like FELDA, FELCRA and RISDA, the agricultural sector was rapidly expanding, with the inclusion of products like rubber and palm oil as the main agricultural produce, The state is home to the largest FELDA settlement known as &#x27;Jengka Triangle&#x27; centred in Bandar Tun Razak, Maran District. Pahang was historically a primary exporter of forestry products like sandalwood, damar and rattans. In modern times, the forestry remains the main sub-sector with tropical timber is an important produce, as large swaths of forest supported massive production of wood products. Yet a decline in mature trees due to intensive harvesting lately has caused a slowdown and the practice of more sustainable forestry. Fishery and aquaculture products are also a main source of income especially for the communities on the long coastline and large network of rivers of the state. Today, agriculture is the second largest component of the state economy which constitutes 23% of the total state GDP. It contributes approximately 12.3% of the federal GDP, the fourth largest after Sarawak, Sabah and Johor. Under East Coast Economic Region (ECER) masterplan, introduced in 2007, the agro-businesses in the state is set to move up further the value chain, with the introduction of agricultural initiatives like Nucleus Cattle Breeding and Research Centre at Muadzam Shah, Rompin Integrated Pineapple Plantation, Kuantan-Maran Agrovalley for leafy vegetables and maize, as well as Pekan-Rompin-Mersing Agrovalley for watermelon, vegetables, roselle, and maize.

The third largest component of Pahang economy is the manufacturing sector. It forms 22.1% of the state economy and its growth is mainly driven by the many resource-based industries, including the processing of rubber, wood, palm oil, petrochemicals and other halal products. Pahang automotive industry, which is rapidly developing, is centred in Peramu Jaya Industrial Park in Pekan. Home to well known automotive players including DefTech, Isuzu HICOM Malaysia, Mercedes-Benz and Suzuki, the industrial park is expected to expand into the 217ha Pekan Automotive Park, scheduled to complete in 2020. The expansion plan is expected to transform the area into a national and regional hub for car assembly, manufacturing of automotive parts and components, as well as automotive research and development activities. This would be part of the manufacturing initiatives under East Coast Economic Region (ECER) masterplan, that would also involve development of other manufacturing industrial parks including Gebeng Integrated Petrochemical Complex (GIPC), Malaysia-China Kuantan Industrial Park (MCKIP), Pahang Technology Park (PTP), Kuantan Integrated Bio Park (KIBP), and Gambang Halal Park (GHP). Most of these industrial parks are located within the ECER Special Economic Zone that stretches from district of Kerteh, Terengganu in the north to the district of Pekan, Pahang in the south. Envisioned to be the key engine of economic growth in the ECER, the economic zone is expected to attract $23 billion of Foreign Direct Investment and create 120,000 new jobs by 2020.

== Infrastructure ==
Infrastructure in Pahang, like the rest of the east coast region of Peninsular Malaysia, is still relatively underdeveloped compared to the west coast. To reduce the development gap, the federal government, have been investing heavily in high impact development as well as in upgrading the existing infrastructures. Development grant to the state government amounts to $24.82 million in 2017. In federal budget 2017, about $958 million allocation was announced for Malaysian states to improve the public infrastructures. About 46% of the state annual budget are also allocated for the improvement of the state infrastructure. Pahang also financed much of its infrastructure projects under the privatisation concept, through 13 state statutory bodies including Pahang Development Corporation, Pahang State Foundation, Development Authority of Pahang Tenggara, Tioman Development Authority and Fraser&#x27;s Hill Development Corporation. Under the Tenth Malaysia Plan (2011-2015), $493 million has been allocated for 351 infrastructure projects in the state. While under the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (2016-2020), $547 million has been allocated to Pahang, with infrastructure in the rural areas was given attention with the increase of rural water, electricity supply and road coverage.

Peninsular Malaysia as a whole including Pahang, has almost 100% electrification. Transmission and distribution of electricity in the state of Pahang lie under the responsibility of the national utility company, Tenaga Nasional. The main power plant in Pahang is located in Cameron Highlands with installed capacity 250 MW that generates about 643 GWh of hydroelectricity. Transmission voltages are at 500 kV, 275 kV and 132 kV while distribution voltages are 33 kV, 22 kV, 11 kV and 415 V three-phase or 240 V single-phase. System frequency is 50 Hz 1%. Under its Total Energy Solution, Tenaga Nasional also offers electricity packaged with steam and chilled water for the benefit of certain industries that require multiple forms of energy for their activities.

Access to improved water source in Malaysia is 100%. The water supply in Pahang is managed by the Pahang Water Management Berhad or &quot;Pengurusan Air Pahang Berhad&quot; (PAIP). The department is also responsible for the planning, development, management of water supply as well as billing and collection of payment. In Pahang, water supply comes mainly from rivers and streams and there are about 79 water treatment plants located in various districts. Pahang abundant water sources are also significant to the growing demand of water supply in Greater Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, the industrial heartland of Malaysia. The federal government initiated Pahang-Selangor Raw Water Transfer Project that includes the construction of the Kelau dam on the Pahang river, as well as the transfer of water via a tunnel through the Titiwangsa Mountains.

=== Internet and telecommunication ===
In 2016, the household internet broadband penetration per 100 inhabitants in Pahang was relatively high among states of the east coast, but was lower than Malaysian national figure, 71.7 versus 99.8. Extensive efforts to increase internet access, have been undertaken by the government since 2007 to bridge the digital divide, focusing especially the rural areas. Since 2013, the programs have been expanded to include underserved urban communities as well. As of 2015, 89 internet centres have been established in Pahang, in addition to 11 Mini Community Broadband centres and 1 Community Broadband Library. Community WiFi (WK) initiative has also been implemented by the government since 2011 to provide free internet access through Wifi hotspots. In Pahang alone, a total number of 199 Community Wi-Fi have been set up. In terms of fixed line broadband, suburban broadband initiatives were outlined in the Eleventh Malaysia Plan to increase broadband accessibility in suburban and rural areas. By 2016, the number of ports in Pahang was growing up to 7,936 ports, the fourth highest in Malaysia after Selangor, Johor and Perak.

The mobile telecommunication penetration, although increasingly popular, was lower compared to the national figure per 100 inhabitants, 130.9 against national figure 143.8. Cellular coverage expansion in Pahang is served by 207 communication towers, with 3G mobile broadband coverage has been expanded to 150 sites and LTE mobile broadband to 42 sites respectively. To accommodate the demand for high-speed mobile broadband, the core network capacity has been upgraded, with fibre-optic network has been expanded in 2015 to a total 45.6 km. In 2015, an initiative was announced by the federal government to connect the Peninsular and the East Malaysia states, Sabah and Sarawak with submarine fibre optic cable network bringing 4 terabits per second capacity with a total distance of approximately 3,800 kilometres. The planned submarine cable will connect the state of Pahang and Sabah through connecting points in Cherating and Kota Kinabalu respectively.

=== Transportation ===

Much like many former British protectorates, Pahang uses a dual carriageway with the left-hand traffic rule. As of 2013, Pahang had a total of of connected roadways, with being paved state routes, of dirt tracks, of gravel roads, and of paved federal road. The primary route in Pahang is the East Coast Expressway, which is the extension of Kuala Lumpur–Karak Expressway, that connects the east coast and the west coast of the Peninsular Malaysia. The expressway passes through 3 states of the peninsular; Pahang, Terengganu and Selangor, connects Kuantan Port to the national grid and links many important town and cities of the east coast to the industrial heartland of Malaysia in the west. Another important route, the Central Spine Road which was laid out in the Eleventh Malaysian Plan, is an alternative road to the east coast, connecting Kuala Krai in Kelantan and Bentong District in Pahang.

The main railway line is the KTM East Coast Railway Line, nicknamed the &#x27;Jungle Railway&#x27; for its route that passes through the sparsely populated and heavily forested interior. It is operated by Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad, a federal government-linked company. The 526 km long single track metre gauge that runs between Gemas in Negeri Sembilan and Tumpat in Kelantan, was historically used during British protectorate to transport Tin. A more advanced railway line, the double-track and electrified MRL East Coast Rail Link (ECRL), was announced in 2016 as a project under ECER&#x27;s master plan, to transport both passengers and cargo. The planned 688 km long new railway line is set to form the backbone of ECER&#x27;s multimodal transport infrastructure, linking the existing transportation hub in ECER Special Economic Zone (SEZ) with the west coast region.

The Special Economic Zone that centred at Kuantan, is the main transportation hub for bus services, air routes and sea routes for the entire east coast region. Terminal Kuantan Sentral serves as the land transportation hub, offering intrastate services that connects all districts of Pahang, as well as interstate services that links the state to the rest of the Peninsular, including Singapore and Thailand. In 2012, the government announced that Prasarana, which runs Rapid KL, would take over all public bus services in Kuantan under a new entity, Rapid Kuantan. The only airport in Pahang is Sultan Ahmad Shah Airport, also known as Kuantan Airport. Located 15 km from Kuantan, it serves both domestic and international flights. Direct international flights connect the state with Singapore. The airport serves the national carrier Malaysia Airlines and its low-cost subsidiary Firefly. It also houses the 6th Squadron and 19th Squadron of the Royal Malaysian Air Force. Kuantan is also home to Pahang&#x27;s only seaport, the Kuantan Port. The multipurpose seaport, that handles both intermodal containers and bulk cargo, is an important gateway of the international sea trading routes for the entire east coast region of Peninsular Malaysia. Since 2013, the port embarked on massive expansion program with the development of New Deep Water Terminal consisting 2 km berth extension, to be fully integrated with the Malaysia-China Kuantan Industrial Park (MCKIP) and other neighbouring industrial parks within the Special Economic Zone. This expansion plan, along with other high impact development projects are in tandem with the escalating economic development of the Eastern Industrial Corridor.

=== Healthcare ===
Pahang population has benefited from a well- developed Malaysian health care system, good access to clean water and sanitation, and strong social and economic programmes. Health care services consist of tax-funded and federal government-run primary health care centres and hospitals, and fast-growing private services mainly located in physician clinics and hospitals in urban areas. Infant mortality rate per 1000 live births, a standard in determining the overall efficiency of healthcare, in 2010 was 7.6. As of national figure, infant mortality fell from 75 per 1000 live births in 1957 to 7 in 2013. Life expectancy at birth in 2016 was 70.8 years for male and 76.3 years for female.

The public healthcare system in Pahang is provided by five specialist government hospitals; Tengku Ampuan Afzan Hospital, Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Hospital, Bentong Hospital, Kuala Lipis Hospital and Pekan Hospital, as well as other district hospitals, public health clinics, 1Malaysia clinics, and rural clinics. There are several private hospitals in Pahang, including Kuantan Medical Centre, KPJ Pahang Specialist Hospital, Darul Makmur Medical Centre, PRKMUIP Specialist Hospital and KCDC Hospital. The IIUM Medical Centre located in Bandar Indera Mahkota, is a government-funded teaching hospital managed by Kulliyyah of Medicine, International Islamic University Malaysia. For outpatient treatment, general practitioners are available at private-owned clinics which are easily accessible in most housing estates. The availability of affordable advanced medical services had benefited the state directly from the booming Malaysian medical tourism.

Public health system is financed mainly through general revenue and taxation collected by the federal government, while the private sector is funded principally through out-of-pocket payments from patients and some private health insurance. There is still, however, a significant shortage in the medical workforce, especially of highly trained specialists; thus, certain medical care and treatment are available only in large towns. Recent efforts to bring many facilities to other towns have been hampered by lack of expertise to run the available equipment. As a result, secondary care is offered in smaller public medical facilities in suburbs and rural areas, while more complex tertiary care is available in regional and national hospitals in urban areas like Temerloh and Kuantan.

=== Education ===

Education in Pahang is overseen by two federal ministries, the Ministry of Education responsible for primary and secondary education, and Ministry of Higher Education that is responsible for universities, polytechnic and community colleges. Although public education is the responsibility of the Federal Government, Pahang has an Education Department to co-ordinate educational matters in its territory. The main legislation governing education is the Education Act 1996. The education system features a non-compulsory kindergarten education followed by six years of compulsory primary education, and five years of optional secondary education. Schools in the primary education system are divided into two categories: national primary schools, which teach in Malay, and vernacular schools, which teach in Chinese or Tamil. Secondary education is conducted for five years. In the final year of secondary education, students sit for the Malaysian Certificate of Education examination. Since the introduction of the matriculation programme in 1999, students who completed the 12-month programme in matriculation colleges can enroll in local universities. By Malaysian law, primary education is compulsory. Early childhood education is not directly controlled by the Ministry of Education as it does with primary and secondary education. However, the ministry does oversee the licensing of private kindergartens, the main form of early childhood education, in accordance with the National Pre-School Quality Standard, which was launched in 2013.

Around the time of independence in 1957, overall adult literacy of Malaya in general was quite low at 51%. By the year 2000, adult literacy had increased significantly in Pahang to 92.5% and further increased to 95% ten years later in 2010 census. From these figures, urban literacy was recorded at 95% in 2000 and increased to 97.5 in 2010, while rural literacy was recorded at 90% in 2000 and increased to about 93.5% in 2010.

As of 2017, there are 736 schools in Pahang, which 540 are primary and 196 are secondary schools. Included in this figure are 8 technical/vocational schools and 18 state religious secondary schools managed by Pahang Islamic Religious Department. In addition to federal and state government-funded schools, there are a number of international private schools in Pahang. Garden International School, International School of Kuantan, and International Islamic School Malaysia are the three main international schools serving primary and secondary levels. Another notable international school is Highlands International Boarding School located in Genting Highlands that caters secondary education.

Tertiary education in the state offers certificate, diploma, first degree and higher degree qualifications. The higher learning institutions consist of two major groups, public and private institutions. Public institutions includes universities, polytechnics, community colleges and teacher training institutes. While the private institutions includes private universities, university colleges, foreign branch campus universities and private colleges. Among notable public universities are Universiti Malaysia Pahang, International Islamic University Malaysia Kuantan Campus, one state campus of Universiti Teknologi MARA in Jengka, and two satellite campuses in Kuantan and Raub. Pahang is also home to private universities like DRB-Hicom University of Automotive Malaysia and Universiti Tenaga Nasional Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Campus.

== Demography ==

According to the latest national census in 2010, Pahang population stood at 1.5 million including non-Malaysian citizens, making it Malaysia&#x27;s ninth most populous state. In 2017, with average annual population growth at 1.61%, the population number is projected to increase to 1.65 million. Pahang population is distributed over a large area resulting in the state having the second lowest population density in the country after Sarawak, with only 42people per km2. In terms of age group, overall population is relatively young, people within the 0-14 age group constitute to 29.4% of the total population; the 14-64 age group corresponds to 65.4%; while senior citizens aged 65 or older make up 5.2%. The ratio of males to female is the highest in Malaysia at 113, with male population was recorded at 0.809 million compared to female population figure at 0.615 million. As of 2010, the crude birth rate in Pahang was 17.3 per 1000 individuals, the crude death rate was 5.1 per 1000 population, and the infant mortality rate was 7.6 per 1000 live births.

About 95% of the population are Malaysian citizens. Malaysian citizens are divided along ethnic lines, with 75% considered &quot;bumiputera&quot;. The largest group of &quot;bumiputera&quot; that make up 70% of Pahang population, are Malays, who are defined in the constitution as Muslims who practice Malay customs and culture. They play a dominant role politically. &quot;Bumiputera&quot; status is also accorded to certain non-Malay indigenous peoples that make up 5% of the population, in particular the aboriginal groups known as Orang Asli. Other non-Malay indigenous peoples also include ethnic Thais, Khmers, Chams and the natives of Sabah and Sarawak. 15.3% of the population are of Chinese descent, while those of Indian descent comprise 4% of the population. The presence of Chinese miner-merchants was recorded since the time of the old Pahang Sultanate, and the community have historically been dominant in the business and commerce community. Immigrants from India, the majority of them Tamils and began arriving in large numbers during British protectorate at the end of the 19th century. Every citizen is issued a biometric smart chip identity card known as &quot;MyKad&quot; at the age of 12, and must carry the card at all times.

In 1957, a large majority of the population resided in rural areas with urbanisation rate stood at only 22.2%. The urbanisation had increased significantly but relatively at a lower rate compared to other states, owing to its large agricultural lands. The state had the second lowest urbanisation rate after Kelantan in 2010 census, with 50.5% of the population resided in urban areas and the remainder are rural dwellers. By 2020, it has been targeted that the urbanisation rate would reach 58.8%. Major urban centres are Kuantan, Temerloh, Bentong and Pekan, serving as Pahang main commercial and financial centres. Due to the rise in labour-intensive industries, the state has over 74 thousands migrant workers; about 5% of the population, mainly employed in agriculture and industrial sectors.

=== Ethnicity ===

As a multiracial country, Malaysia is home to many ethnic groups. In 2016, it is ranked 59th most ethnically diverse countries in the world with index at 0.596. However, ethnic diversity is not equally distributed among its states and territories. Pahang is categorised as medium ethnically diverse state with 0.36 of ethnic diversity index in 2010. It is ranked 5th least diverse among Malaysian states and territories, after Terengganu, Kelantan, Malacca and Perlis. The least ethnically diverse districts are Pekan, Rompin and Temerloh (index between 0.1 and 0.39), and the most ethnically diverse districts are Bentong and Raub (index between 0.49 and 0.59) where minorities form significant proportion of the population. Ethnic diversity in Pahang was historically high, at an index between 0.5 and 0.6 in the 1970s, but showing a downward trend decades later, largely caused by outward migration, high birth rate of the majority population and the opening up of new agricultural lands particularly the FELDA settlements, that attract many immigrants from other Malaysian states.

The most dominant ethnic group are Malays that make up 70% of Pahang population, who are defined in the constitution as Muslims who practice Malay customs and culture. The Malays in turn, can be further divided into several sub-ethnic groups, of which the most dominant are the Pahang Malays. Historically, the community can be found in the vast riverine systems of Pahang and are prominently featured in the state&#x27;s history. There are also small Pahang Malay communities in the valley of the Lebir River in Kelantan and the upper portions of several rivers near the Perak and Selangor boundaries, descendants of fugitives from the civil war that ravaged their homeland in the 19th century. The Terengganuan Malays, another east coast sub-ethnicity, are native to narrow strip of sometimes discontiguous fishermen villages and towns along the coastline of Pahang. Other important Malay sub-ethnicities include the Kelantanese and Kedahans, that migrated from Kelantan and Kedah respectively, and can be found in major urban centres and agricultural settlements.

The Malays are collectively referred as &quot;bumiputera&quot; along with other non-Malay indigenous people that constitutes about 5% of the state&#x27;s population. The community of Orang Asli form the most dominant non-Malay indigenous group. According to 2010 census, Pahang has the largest Orang Asli population in Malaysia with 64,000 people, followed by Perak with 42,841 people. The Orang Asli in Pahang is grouped into 3 large groups; Negrito, Senoi and Proto Malay. Approximately 40% of them live close to or within forested areas, and engage in swiddening as well as hunting and gathering of forest products. Some also practise permanent agriculture and manage their own rubber, oil palm, or cocoa farms. A very small number, especially among the Negrito groups, are still semi-nomadic and depend on the seasonal bounties of the forest. Due to sweeping modernisation, a fair number of them are to be found in urban areas surviving on their waged or salaried jobs. The three groups of Orang Asli can be divided further into several smaller tribes that traditionally domiciled in certain geographical part of Pahang. The Bateq tribe of Negrito group can be found in northern part of Pahang. Two Senoi tribes, Semaq Beri and Semai are also domiciled in northern Pahang. Two other Senoi tribes, Chewong and Jah Hut communities can be found in central Pahang. Meanwhile, the southern part of the state is dominated by Proto Malay tribes of Jakun, Temoq, Semelai and Temuan.

The minorities consist of Chinese and Indians form collectively about 19.5% of the population. They are descendants of immigrants from China and India that came in large numbers during British protectorate to work in the mines, rubber plantations and various services sector. They are primarily concentrated in the western districts of Raub and Bentong and other urban areas.

=== Religion ===
The constitution of Pahang established Islam as a state religion, but grants freedom to manifest other religions in its territory. In the areas of family law and religious observances, the Sharia law are applied to the Muslims and came under the jurisdiction of the Sharia court. The jurisdiction of Syariah courts is limited to Muslims in matters such as marriage, inheritance, divorce, apostasy, religious conversion, and custody among others. No other criminal or civil offences are under the jurisdiction of the Shariah courts, which have a similar hierarchy to the Civil Courts. Despite being the supreme courts of the land, the Civil Courts do not hear matters related to Islamic practices. Matters related to the enforcement of the Syariah law falls under the jurisdiction of the &quot;Jabatan Agama Islam Pahang&quot; (&#x27;Pahang Islamic Religious Department&#x27;). Pahang&#x27;s constitution empowers the Sultan as the head of Islam and Malay customs in the state. State council known as &quot;Majlis Ugama Islam dan Adat Resam Melayu Pahang&quot; (&#x27;Council of Islam and Malay Customs of Pahang&#x27;) is responsible in advising the ruler as well as regulating both Islamic affairs and &quot;adat&quot;. Sunni Islam of Shafi&#x27;i school of jurisprudence is the dominant branch of Islam, and became the basis of Sharia court rulings and Sharia law passed in the Pahang State Legislative Assembly.

According to the Population and Housing Census 2010 figures, ethnicity and religious beliefs correlate highly. Approximately 74.9% of the population practice Islam, 14.4% practice Buddhism, 4% Hinduism, 2.7% non-religious, 1.9% Christianity.

The Malaysian constitution defines a &quot;Malay&quot;, as someone who is a Muslim, speaks Malay regularly, practises Malay customs, and lives in or have ancestors from Malaysia and Singapore. All Malays are therefore necessarily Muslim. Statistics from the 2010 Census indicate that 89.4% of the Chinese population identify as Buddhists, with significant minorities of adherents identifying as Christians (6.7%), Chinese folk religions (2.8%) and Muslims (0.4%). The majority of the Indian population identify as Hindus (90.3%), with a significant minorities of numbers identifying as Muslims (3.6%), Christians (2.5%) and Buddhists (2.3%). The non-Malay &quot;bumiputera&quot; community are predominantly Atheists (51.9%), with significant minorities identifying as Muslims (11.8%) and Christians (11.7%).

=== Languages ===
The official and state language of Pahang is Malaysian, a standardised form of the Malay language. The terminology as per federal government policy is &quot;Bahasa Malaysia&quot; (literally &quot;Malaysian language&quot;) but in the federal constitution continues to refer to the official language as &quot;Bahasa Melayu&quot; (literally &quot;Malay language&quot;). The National Language Act 1967 specifies the Latin (Rumi) script as the official script of the national language, but allow the use of the traditional Jawi script. Jawi is still used in the official documents of state Islamic religious department and council, on road and building signs, and also taught in primary and religious schools. In 2018, the then Regent of Pahang in a royal decree, expressed his wish for a wider use of Jawi on road signs, business premises, office signs, government agencies and all state education offices in the state. Among the earliest response to the royal decree was by Kuantan Municipal Council that announced enforcement by 2019. English remains an active second language, with its use allowed for some official purposes under the National Language Act of 1967.

The Malay language spoken in Pahang can be further divided into several varieties of Malay dialects. Pahang Malay is the most dominant Malay dialect spoken along the vast riverine systems of Pahang, but it co-exists with other Malay dialects traditionally spoken in the state. Along the coastline of Pahang, Terengganu Malay is spoken in a narrow strip of sometimes discontiguous fishermen villages and towns. Another dialect spoken in Tioman Island is a distinct Malay variant and most closely related to Riau Archipelago Malay subdialect spoken in Natuna and Anambas islands in the South China Sea, together forming a dialect continuum between the Bornean Malay with the Mainland Peninsular/Sumatran Malay. Kelantanese and Kedahan, along with other Malay dialects are also spoken by immigrants from other Malaysian states.

Pahang is also home to majority of Orang Asli languages, mostly belong to Aslian branch of Austroasiatic such as Semai, Batek, Semoq Beri, Jah Hut, Temoq, Che Wong, Semelai (although recognised as &quot;Proto-Malay&quot;), Temiar and Mendriq. Besides Austroasiatic, Proto-Malay languages that is a branch of Austronesian are also spoken, mostly Temuan and Jakun.

Malaysian Chinese predominantly speak Chinese dialects from the southern provinces of China. The more common Chinese varieties in the country are Mandarin, Hokkien, Hakka, Cantonese, Hainanese and Fuzhou.

Tamil is used predominantly by Tamils, who form a majority of Malaysian Indians.

== Culture ==

As a less ethnically diverse state, the traditional culture of Pahang is largely predominated by the indigenous culture, of both Malays and Orang Asli. Both cultures trace their origin from the early settlers in the state that consist primarily from both various Malayic speaking Austronesians and Mon-Khmer speaking Austroasiatic tribes. Around the opening of the common era, Mahayana Buddhism was introduced to the region, where it flourished with the establishment of a Buddhist state from the 5th century. Malayic cultures flourished during Srivijayan era, and Malayisation intensified after Pahang was established as a Malay-Muslim Sultanate in 1470. The development of many Malay-dominated centres in the state, drew some of the natives to embrace Malayness by converting to Islam, emulating the Malay speech and their dress. Pahang Malays share similar cultural traits with other sub-groups of Malay people native to the Malay Peninsula. They are in particular closely affiliated to peoples of the east coast of the peninsula like Thai Malays, Terengganuan Malays and Kelantanese Malays.

Unlike the relatively homogeneous Malay culture, the cultural features Orang Asli are represented by significantly diverse tribal identities. Prior to the 1960, the various indigenous groups did not consciously adopt a common ethnic marker to differentiate themselves from the Malays. The label &#x27;Orang Asli&#x27; itself was historically came from the British. Each tribe has its own language and culture, and perceives itself as different from the others. This micro identity was largely derived spatially, from geographical area they traditionally settled. Their cultural distinctiveness was relative only to other Orang Asli communities, and these perceived differences were great enough for each group to regard itself as unique from the other.

In 1971, the government created a &quot;National Cultural Policy&quot;, defining Malaysian culture. It stated that Malaysian culture must be based on the culture of the indigenous peoples of Malaysia, that it may incorporate suitable elements from other cultures, and that Islam must play a part in it. It also promoted the Malay language above others. This government intervention into culture has caused resentment among immigrant communities who feel their cultural freedom was lessened. Both Chinese and Indian associations have submitted memorandums to the government, accusing it of formulating an undemocratic culture policy.

=== Arts ===
Traditional visual arts was mainly centred on the areas of carving, weaving, and silversmithing, and ranges from handwoven baskets from rural areas to the silverwork of the Malay courts. The Malays had traditionally adorned their monuments, boats, weapons, tombs, musical instrument, and utensils by motives of flora, calligraphy, geometry and cosmic feature. Common artworks included ornamental kris, beetle nut sets, and woven batik and songket fabrics. The Malay handloom industry traced its origin since the 13th century when the eastern trade route flourished under Song dynasty. By the 16th century, the silk weaving industry in Pahang had perfected a style called &quot;Tenun Pahang&quot;, a special clothing fabric used in the special traditional Malay costumes and attires of Pahang rulers and palace officials. In addition to silk weaving, Batik weaving has been part of the small cottage industry in the state. Although not as popular, Pahang batik has, nevertheless, thrived as a small industry in the periphery of the fame of the Terengganu and Kelantan batik. Over the centuries, a distinctive style of Baju Kurung was developed in Pahang, commonly known as Baju Kurung Pahang or Baju Riau-Pahang, or sometimes called &quot;Baju Turki&quot;. This is a long gown styled dress, cut at the front with 7 or more buttons and worn with a sarong.

Traditional Malay music is based around percussion instruments, the most important of which is the gendang (drum). There are at least 14 types of traditional drums. Drums and other traditional percussion instruments and are often made from natural materials. Pahang traditional music may be classified as a type of old oral literature in poetic forms, which exist in several different genres. The most notable one is a set of 36 songs in &quot;Indung&quot; dance. Another significant genre is a set of healing songs in &quot;Saba&quot; dance commonly performed using shamanistic charms There are other genres exist, among others are songs from traditional dances of &quot;Mayang&quot;&#x27;, &quot;Limbung&quot; and &quot;Lukah&quot;, songs from &quot;Dikir Rebana&quot;, &quot;Berdah&quot;, &quot;Main Puteri&quot; and &quot;Ugam&quot; performances, as well as &quot;Lagu dodoi&quot; (lullabies), &quot;Lagu bercerita&quot; (story telling songs) and &quot;Lagu Permainan&quot; (children game songs). Other popular Pahang folk songs included; &quot;Walinung Sari&quot;, &quot;Burung Kenek-Kenek&quot;, &quot;Pak Sang Bagok&quot;, &quot;Lagu Zikir&quot;, &quot;Lagu Orang Muda&quot;, &quot;Pak Sendayung&quot;, &quot;Anak Ayam Turun Sepuluh&quot;, &quot;Cung-Cung Nai&quot;, &quot;Awang Belanga&quot;, &quot;Kek Nong&quot; or &quot;Dayang Kek Nong&quot;, &quot;Camang Di Laut&quot;, &quot;Datuk Kemenyan Tunggal&quot;, &quot;Berlagu Ayam&quot;, &quot;Walida Sari&quot;, &quot;Raja Donan&quot;, &quot;Raja Muda&quot;, &quot;Syair Tua&quot;, &quot;Anak Dagang&quot;, &quot;Puteri Bongsu&quot;, &quot;Raja Putera&quot;, &quot;Puteri Mayang Mengurai&quot;, &quot;Puteri Tujuh&quot;, &quot;Pujuk Lebah&quot;, &quot;Ketuk Kabung&quot; (&quot;Buai Kangkong&quot;) and &quot;Tebang Tebu&quot;.

Forms of ritual theatre among the Pahang Malays include the &quot;Main Puteri&quot;, &quot;Saba&quot; and many forms of &quot;Ugam&quot; performances. There are &quot;Ugam Mayang&quot;, &quot;Ugam Lukah&quot;, &quot;Ugam Kukur&quot; and &quot;Ugam Serkap&quot;, all of which involve trance and serve as agents of healing by a Bomoh. &quot;Ugam Mayang&quot; is also popularly known in Terengganu and the rest of Malaysia as &quot;Ulek Mayang&quot;. One of the most popular dance theatre is Mak Yong, which is also performed in Kelantan and Terengganu. Popular dance forms also include &quot;Joget Pahang&quot;( a local style of &quot;Joget&quot;), &quot;Zapin Pekan&quot; and &quot;Zapin Raub&quot; (local styles of &quot;Zapin&quot;), and &quot;Dikir Pahang&quot; or &quot;Dikir Rebana&quot; (a modified and secularised form of dhikr or religious chanting, also performed in Kelantan as Dikir barat). &quot;Dikir Rebana&quot; which is further divided into &quot;Dikir Maulud&quot; and &quot;Dikir Berdah&quot;, has many songs played by a group of 5 to 7 people and was historically performed in the royal court. Pahang performing arts also include some native dance forms like &quot;Limbung&quot;, &quot;Labi-Labi&quot;, &quot;Pelanduk&quot; and &quot;Indung&quot;. A distinct form of &quot;gamelan&quot; adopted from the Javanese culture during the time of Johor Empire, known as Malay Gamelan or &quot;Gamelan Pahang&quot;, forms the main musical ensemble heritage in the state and patronised by royal court of Pahang since the 19th century.

Pahang has a strong oral tradition that has existed since before the arrival of writing, and continues today. Prominent Malay folklore of Pahang origin, includes such bardic tales as the legends of Putri Walinong Sari, Sang Kelembai, &quot;Seri Gumum&quot; of Chini Lake, and the white crocodile &quot;Seri Pahang&quot; of Pahang River. In addition to oral literature, the literary tradition in Pahang traced back to the time of the old Pahang Sultanate. Contribution into the rich Classical Malay literature is attested in the form of legal literature like &quot;Hukum Kanun Pahang&quot; and historical literature like &quot;Hikayat Pahang&quot;.

=== Cuisine ===
Traditional Pahang cuisine features a lot of seafood, similar to the traditional cuisine of other states. From its rivers and lakes come the fresh water fish such as the &quot;patin&quot; (Pangasius). Certain dishes are shared with other Malay groups, like &quot;Singgang&quot;, &quot;Tembosa&quot;, &quot;Satak&quot; and &quot;Lempeng Nyiur&quot; which also commonly found in Kelantan and Terengganu.

The dish consists of juicy, tender patin fish cooked in curry made of &quot;tempoyak&quot; (fermented durian). Other notable Pahang &quot;gulai&quot; are &quot;Gulai Patin Asam Rebus&quot; (a dish similar to the &quot;Gulai Tempoyak Patin&quot; but the watery soup or gravy, tastes a little sour and spicy) and &quot;Asam Rong&quot; (a sour and slightly bitter taste gulai made of processed rubber tree fruits).

<text>In Nordic mythology, Naglfari is the father of Auðr by the personified night, Nótt. Naglfari is attested in a single mention in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; (written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson) book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, where he is described as one of a series of three husbands of Nótt, and that the couple produced a son, Auðr. No additional information is provided about Naglfari.

Rudolf Simek theorizes that Snorri invented Naglfari but states that his reason for doing so is unknown.

<text>In Norse mythology, Dvalinn (Old Norse: ) is a dwarf (Hjort) who appears in several Old Norse tales and kennings. The name translates as &quot;the dormant one&quot; or &quot;the one slumbering&quot; (akin to the Danish and Norwegian &quot;dvale&quot; and Swedish &quot;dvala&quot;, meaning &quot;sleep&quot;, &quot;unconscious condition&quot; or &quot;hibernation&quot;). Dvalinn is listed as one of the four stags of Yggdrasill in both &quot;Grímnismál&quot; from the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; from the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;.

==Attestation==

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, Dvalinn is mentioned as a name in the listing of dwarves, and again in a later stanza as a leader taking a host of dwarfs from the mountains to find a new dwelling place:

:&quot;The rocks they left, and through wet lands
:They sought a home, in the fields of sand&quot;

In &quot;Hávamál&quot;, Dvalinn is said to have introduced the writing of runes to the dwarfs, as Dáinn had done for the elves and Odin for the gods.

In &quot;Alvíssmál&quot;, a kenning for the sun is listed as the &quot;deceiver of Dvalinn&quot;, referring to the sun&#x27;s power of turning dwarfs into stone. In skaldic poetry, &quot;Dvalinn&#x27;s drink&quot; is used as a kenning for poetry, since the mead of poetry was originally created by the dwarfs.

In &quot;Fáfnismál&quot;, during a discussion between Sigurd and Fafnir concerning the minor Norns (apart from the three great Norns), those who govern the lives and destinies of dwarfs are also known as &quot;Dvalinn&#x27;s daughters&quot;.

===Sagas===
In &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, Dvalinn is one of a pair of dwarves (including Durin) who forged the magic sword Tyrfing.

===Sörla þáttr===
In the &quot;Sörla þáttr&quot;, an Icelandic short story written by two Christian priests in the 15th century, Dvalinn is the name of one of the four dwarves (including Alfrigg, Berling and Grer) who fashioned a necklace which was later acquired by a woman called Freyja, who is King Odin&#x27;s concubine, after she agreed to spend a night with each of them.

===Kálfsvísa===
In the &quot;Kálfsvísa&quot;, Dvalinn is mentioned in a list of Norse heroes and their horses. Dvalinn rides a horse named Móðnir (&quot;Spirited&quot;).

==Modern influence==
J. R. R. Tolkien took the name as Dwalin for one of the dwarves in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.
Rich Burlew has Dvalin as the first king of the Dwarves, an ascended demigod of the Northern Pantheon in &quot;The Order of the Stick&quot;. In Joanne Harris&#x27; &quot;The Gospel of Loki&quot;, Dvalin is the name of one of the Sons of Ivaldi. In &quot;Genshin Impact&quot;, Dvalin is the name of one of the Four Winds in Mondstadt chosen by the God of the wind, Barbatos.

<text>John Andrew Roth is a Canadian retired business executive. He was the chief executive officer and chairman of Nortel Networks between 1997 and 2001. While he was called &quot;the most successful businessman in modern Canadian history&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine and named Canada&#x27;s CEO of the Year by a Bay Street panel in the fall of 2000, by the ignominious end of his career it became clear that his mismanagement destroyed the company.

==Career at Nortel==
Roth joined Northern Telecom in 1969 as a design engineer, rising to become CEO after a long career. Nortel, once one of the most highly regarded Canadian companies in history, fell into severe financial difficulties under his tenure and filed for bankruptcy shortly after Mr. Roth was forced out. Although he had in the past received much praise from a credulous business press, it became clear that his mismanagement led to the destruction of a once great company. The Toronto Star, reporting on January 14, 2013 on the trial of Mr. Roth&#x27;s successor as CEO reported &quot;... the real force behind Nortel’s demise — [was]the reckless conduct of ... former Nortel CEO John Roth...Roth emerged from the wreckage with more than $100 million in stock-option proceeds.&quot;

Nortel eventually filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada and the United States. The bankruptcy case was the largest in Canadian history and left pensioners, shareholders and former employees with enormous losses. Total losses to those stakeholders amounted to $54 billion, the tenth largest such loss in the history of capitalism.

Between 1993 and 1995, Roth served as president of Nortel&#x27;s North American operations.
He was named Northern Telecom Limited&#x27;s CEO in 1995 and was elected to the board of directors in 1996. In February 1997, he was named president of the corporation, in addition to continuing to serve as CEO. In October 1997, Roth became president and CEO of the company which became known as Nortel Networks.

Under Roth&#x27;s control, Nortel became the leading engine of Canada&#x27;s 1990s high-tech boom. Nortel became the most important stock traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and became one of Canada&#x27;s leading employers. Roth used his success and high popularity to lobby the government for tax cuts, but he did not support Clive Allen&#x27;s statement to threaten to move Nortel to the United States if taxes were not lowered.

Network World, on January 4, 1999, referred to Roth as one of the 25 most powerful people in networking, a &quot;man of boldness and vision, one who would rather strike than be stricken.&quot;

&quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, on December 13, 2000, referred to Roth as having &quot;engineered some 16 acquisitions while putting the pedal to the metal internally to transform Nortel from a simple telecom equipment provider into a global brand name identified with the Internet.&quot;

&quot;We were a slow company and we had to work very hard to become a fast one,&quot; says Roth, who began his tenure as CEO with a letter to employees in which he told them the time had come for the century-old company to &quot;get off its duff&quot; and join the new economy.

&quot;Time Europe&quot;, on December 25, 2000, noted that &quot;The change [in Canadian government policies] marked the triumph of ideas forcefully argued by the most successful businessman in modern Canadian history: Nortel Networks CEO John Roth, 58. Mr. Roth warned that &#x27;the country (Canada) risked becoming a second-rank economic power unless it changed its wealth-crimping tax policies and supported high-tech winners (like Nortel)&quot;. Roth urged the government of Canada to provide &quot;better tax treatment of stock options&quot;, saying, &quot;Policies and business strategies that worked well in the industrial era are a recipe for stagnation and decline in the new economy.&quot; Roth invested heavily in fiber-optic communication technology which was seen as the key infrastructure technology for the new network.

==Retirement==

In November 2001, Roth was replaced as CEO of Nortel Networks by Frank Dunn.

<text>Adamari López Torres (born May 18, 1971) is a Puerto Rican actress known for participating in several Puerto Rican and Mexican soap operas. She was a host on the Telemundo morning show &quot;Hoy Día&quot; and its predecessor &quot;Un Nuevo Día&quot; for 11 years, and is a Latina ambassador for WW, formerly Weight Watchers.

==Early career==
The daughter of an undertaker, Luis López, Adamari started her career at the age of six in the Telemundo Canal 2 production of the &quot;Cristina Bazán&quot; soap opera, alongside legendary Puerto Rican actress Johanna Rosaly and Venezuelan singer José Luis Rodríguez, &quot;El Puma&quot;.

Her talent indicated a future superstar. WAPA-TV next chose her to play Iris Chacón and Daniel Guerrero&#x27;s daughter &quot;Jenny&quot; in &quot;Yo sé que mentía&quot;. She was a child actress playing an important supporting role in the story, thus she became a household name.

A short, two chapter appearance on &quot;Vivir Para Ti&quot; followed in 1983, and after that, López decided to dedicate herself to her studies. She holds a B.A. in communications from the University of the Sacred Heart.

==Adulthood and fame==
After reaching the age of maturity, she came back, participating in several plays at Puerto Rico&#x27;s Teatro Tapia, San Juan&#x27;s premier and oldest theater, and getting the attention of Mexican producers.

She traveled to Mexico next, after the invitation by the producers to try out there, and became a superstar in that country as well, working in many top soap operas, including &quot;Camila&quot; and the national super hit &quot;Amigas y Rivales&quot;. López also participated in &quot;Mujer, Casos de la Vida Real&quot;, where she played a victim of rape that later turned lesbian.

==Recent years==
In 2004, López participated in the soap opera &quot;Mujer de Madera&quot;. During the recording of that soap opera, her father, Luis, a respected and successful undertaker, suffered a heart attack and had to be hospitalized and operated on. López was given immediate permission to travel to Puerto Rico and be with her father for as long as she needed. Her father recovered, but with only five percent of his heart working. López had to return to Mexico after her father was released from the hospital, but she flew back to Puerto Rico every time that the filming schedule allowed her to. In 2011, she participated in the second season of Univision&#x27;s dancing show Mira Quien Baila where she was one of the top dancers and won the competition.

López was one of the original hosts of the Telemundo morning show &quot;Un Nuevo Día&quot;, which was relaunched as &quot;Hoy Día&quot; in 2021. On April 6, 2023, it was announced that she would be leaving the show after 11 years on the network.

==Personal life and relationships==
López was married to fellow Puerto Rican, singing super star Luis Fonsi. In 2006, López and Fonsi announced they would be getting married during the summer of that year. They were married on June 3, 2006, in Puerto Rico. On November 8, 2009, Adamari López and Luis Fonsi released a joint statement where they announced they were separating. They were divorced on November 8, 2010. In January 2013 López published a tell-all book, &quot;Viviendo&quot;. She met Toni Costa while participating in a dance contest called (Look who&#x27;s dancing) and on September 20, 2014, announced that she was expecting her first child with Costa, who was now her fiancé. She gave birth to a girl, Alaïa, on March 4, 2015. In 2019 she and Costa celebrated 8 years together, as a couple. On May 27, 2021, Maria Celeste Arrarás announced in her social media sites that in an interview, Adamari López stated she and Costa, her partner of 10 years, had separated.

==Health==
On March 22, 2005, López held a press conference in San Juan announcing she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Her then-boyfriend, Luis Fonsi, announced at the same press conference that he was cancelling his 2005 international tour to be by her side. She was expected to recover, as her cancer was caught at &quot;stage 1,&quot; which is a very early stage, and it had not spread to other areas of her body.

She underwent cancer surgery. In 2006, it was reported that she was in remission. Since being diagnosed, she has campaigned for breast cancer awareness.

In 2020, López was a Weight Watchers ambassador. Oprah Winfrey welcomed her into the WW community during her 2020 Vision: Your Life in Focus tour in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

<doc id="87917" wikidata="Q187315" url="?curid=87917" title="Mount Tahan">
<text>Mount Tahan (), is the highest point in Peninsular Malaysia with an elevation of above sea level, on the border between the states of Pahang and Kelantan, with the peak lying on the Pahangese side. It is part of the Taman Negara that straddles Jerantut District in Pahang, Gua Musang District in Kelantan and Hulu Terengganu District in Terengganu. The mountain is part of the Tahan Range in the Tenasserim Hills and is popular with local climbers.

Gunung Tahan is considered by many to be one of the toughest treks in Peninsular Malaysia.

==Trails==

There are three trails to the summit, commonly referred to as:

* Kuala Tahan-Kuala Tahan
* Merapoh-Kuala Tahan or Kuala Tahan-Merapoh
* Merapoh-Merapoh

The Kuala Tahan classic trail is the oldest and most scenic trail. A return trip on this trail typically takes seven days. Climbers have to trek across undulating ridges and make several river crossings before finally reaching the foot of the mountain to make the final ascent. Climbers without adequate physical fitness or training are not advised to attempt Gunung Tahan.

The other two trails are from Merapoh (Sungai Relau). The Merapoh-Merapoh trail is significantly shorter than the other two. A return trip on the Merapoh trail takes 3–4 days. A traverse from Kuala Tahan to Merapoh (or the other way around) takes around 5 days.

==Temperature==
Mount Tahan can be very cold at night. Temperatures can range from 4 °C to 18 °C between December and January, and 7 °C to 27 °C between June and September. Frost can sometimes appear at the summit.

== 1905 Expedition by Federated Malay States Museums ==
In 1905, the director of the Federated Malay States Museums, Leonard Wray Jnr, and Selangor Museum curator Herbert Robinson led a museum collecting expedition to Gunung Tahan.

The expedition involved sixty-five men and lasted five months. Dato’ To Muntri Idin and Penghulu Panglima Kakap Husin laid the groundwork before the main party arrived. On July 15, Bulang, Che Nik, Mat Aris, Mu’min and Robinson were the first to reach the summit.

<text>Conon of Samos (, &quot;Konōn ho Samios&quot;; c. 280 – c. 220 BC) was a Greek astronomer and mathematician. He is primarily remembered for naming the constellation Coma Berenices.

==Life and work==
Conon was born on Samos, Ionia, and possibly died in Alexandria, Ptolemaic Egypt, where he was court astronomer to Ptolemy III Euergetes. He named the constellation Coma Berenices (&quot;Berenice&#x27;s Hair&quot;) after Ptolemy&#x27;s wife Berenice II. She sacrificed her hair in exchange for her husband&#x27;s safe return from the Third Syrian War, which began in 246 BC. When the lock of hair disappeared, Conon explained that the goddess had shown her favor by placing it in the sky. Not all Greek astronomers accepted the designation. In Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;, Coma Berenices is not listed as a distinct constellation. However, Ptolemy does attribute several seasonal indications (&quot;parapegma&quot;) to Conon. Conon was a friend of the mathematician Archimedes whom he probably met in Alexandria.

===Astronomical work===
In astronomy, Conon wrote in seven books his &quot;De astrologia&quot;, including observations on solar eclipses. Ptolemy further attributes seventeen &quot;signs of the seasons&quot; to Conon, although this may not have been given in &quot;De astrologia&quot;. Seneca writes that &quot;Conon was a careful observer&quot; and that he &quot;recorded solar eclipses observed by the Egyptians&quot;, although the accuracy of this statement is doubted. The Roman Catullus writes that Conon &quot;discerned all the lights of the vast universe, and disclosed the risings and settings of the stars, how the fiery brightness of the sun is darkened, and how the stars retreat at fixed times.&quot;
===Mathematical work===
Pappus states that the spiral of Archimedes was discovered by Conon. Apollonius of Perga reported that Conon worked on conic sections, and his work became the basis for Apollonius&#x27; fourth book of the &quot;Conics&quot;. Apollonius further reports that Conon sent some of his work to Thrasydaeus, but that it was incorrect. Since this work has not survived it is impossible to assess the accuracy of Apollonius&#x27; comment.

==Namesake==
* Conon (crater), named in his honor

<doc id="87921" wikidata="Q729140" url="?curid=87921" title="List of counties in Arizona">
<text>There are 15 counties in the U.S. state of Arizona. Four counties (Mohave, Pima, Yavapai and Yuma) were created in 1864 following the organization of the Arizona Territory in 1862. The now defunct Pah-Ute County was split from Mohave County in 1865, but merged back in 1871. All but La Paz County were created by the time Arizona was granted statehood in 1912. La Paz County was established in 1983 after many years of pushing for independence from Yuma County.

Eight of Arizona&#x27;s fifteen counties are named after various Native American groups that are resident in parts of what is now Arizona, with another (Cochise County) being named after a native leader. Four other counties, Gila County, Santa Cruz County, Pinal County, and Graham County, are named for physical features of Arizona&#x27;s landscape: the Gila River, the Santa Cruz River, Pinal Peak, and Mount Graham, respectively. Another county, La Paz County, is named after a former settlement, while the final county, Greenlee County, is named after one of the state&#x27;s early pioneers.

Under Arizona laws, a county shall not be formed or divided by county initiative unless each proposed county would have all of the following characteristics: (1) at least three-fourths of one percent of the total state assessed valuation and at least the statewide per capita assessed valuation; (2) a population of at least three-fourths of one percent of the total state population according to the most recent United States decennial census; (3) at least one hundred square miles of privately owned land; (4) common boundaries with either (a) at least three other existing or proposed counties; or (b) at least two other existing or proposed counties and the state boundary. A county formation commission is required to be formed to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed county. A proposal to divide a county must be approved by a majority of the votes cast in each proposed new county.

Under the Arizona Constitution, counties are politically and legally creatures of the state, and do not have charters of their own. Counties are governed by boards of supervisors which act in the capacity of executive authority for the county within the statutes and powers prescribed by Arizona state law. With few exceptions, these powers are narrowly construed. The state legislature devotes considerable time to local matters, with limited discretion granted to the Board of Supervisors on minor ordinance, zoning, and revenue collection issues.

Arizona&#x27;s postal abbreviation is AZ and its FIPS code is 04.

<text>In Norse mythology, Gullinkambi (Old Norse &quot;golden comb&quot;) is a rooster who lives in Valhalla. In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, Gullinkambi is one of the three roosters whose crowing is foretold to signify the beginning of the events of Ragnarök. The other two roosters are Fjalar in the wood Gálgviðr, and an unnamed soot-red rooster in Hel:


It has been suggested that the central tree depicted in the Överhogdal tapestries is the world tree Yggdrasil and that the bird at the top is Gullinkambi.

<doc id="87924" wikidata="Q337168" url="?curid=87924" title="Einherjar">
<text>In Norse mythology, the einherjar (singular einheri; literally &quot;army of one&quot;, &quot;those who fight alone&quot;) are those who have died in battle and are brought to Valhalla by valkyries. In Valhalla, the einherjar eat their fill of the nightly resurrecting beast Sæhrímnir, and valkyries bring them mead from the udder of the goat Heiðrún. The einherjar prepare daily for the events of Ragnarök, when they will advance for an immense battle at the field of Vígríðr.

The einherjar are attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, the poem &quot;Hákonarmál&quot; (by the 10th century skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir) as collected in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, and a stanza of an anonymous 10th century poem commemorating the death of Eric Bloodaxe known as &quot;Eiríksmál&quot; as compiled in &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;.

An etymological connection exists between the einherjar and the Harii, a Germanic people or figures from early Germanic folklore attested in the 1st century AD, and scholars have connected the einherjar to the eternal battle of Hjaðningavíg and the Wild Hunt. The einherjar have been the subject of works of art and poetry.

==Attestations==
===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===

In the poem &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, Óðinn engages the wise jötunn Vafþrúðnir in a game of wits. Disguised as &quot;Gagnráðr&quot;, Óðinn asks Vafþrúðnir &quot;where men fight in courts every day.&quot; Vafþrúðnir responds that (here &quot;einherjar&quot; is translated as &quot;einheriar&quot;):

In the poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, Óðinn (disguised as &quot;Grímnir&quot;) tells the young Agnarr Geirröðsson that the cook Andhrímnir boils the beast Sæhrímnir, which he refers to as &quot;the best of pork&quot;, in the container Eldhrímnir, yet adds that &quot;but few know by what the einheriar are nourished.&quot; Further into &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, Odin gives a list of valkyries (Skeggjöld, Skögul, Hildr, Þrúðr, Hlökk, Herfjötur, Göll, Geirahöð, Randgríð, Ráðgríð, and Reginleif), and states that they bear ale to the einherjar. Towards the end of the poem, another reference to the einherjar appears when Óðinn tells the king Geirröd (unaware that the man he has been torturing is Óðinn) that Geirröd is drunk, and that Geirröd loses much when he loses his favor and the favor of &quot;all the Einherjar.&quot;

In the poem &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana I&quot;, the hero Sinfjötli flyts with Guðmundur. Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundur of having once been a female, including that he was &quot;a witch, horrible, unnatural, among Odin&#x27;s valkyries&quot; and that all of the einherjar &quot;had to fight, headstrong women, on your account&quot;.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===

In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, the einherjar are introduced in chapter 20. In chapter 20, Third tells Gangleri (described as king Gylfi in disguise) that Óðinn is called &quot;Valföðr&quot; (Old Norse &quot;father of the slain&quot;) &quot;since all those who fall in battle are his adopted sons,&quot; and that Óðinn assigns them places in Valhalla and Vingólf where they are known as einherjar. In chapter 35, High quotes the &quot;Grímnismál&quot; valkyrie list, and says that these valkyries wait in Valhalla, and there serve drink, and look after tableware and drinking vessels in Valhalla. In addition, High says that Óðinn sends valkyries to every battle, that they allot death to men, and govern victory.

In chapter 38, High provides more detail about the einherjar. Gangleri says that &quot;you say that all those men that have fallen in battle since the beginning of the world have now come to Odin in Val-hall. What has he got to offer them food? I should have thought that there must be a pretty large number there.&quot; High replies that it is true there are a pretty large number of men there, adding many more have yet to arrive, yet that &quot;there will seem too few when the wolf comes.&quot; However, High adds that food is not a problem because there will never be too many people in Valhalla that the meat of Sæhrímnir (which he calls a boar) cannot sufficiently feed. High says that Sæhrímnir is cooked every day by the cook Andhrímnir in the pot Eldhrimnir, and is again whole every evening. High then quotes the stanza of &quot;Grímnismál&quot; mentioning the cook, meal, and container in reference.

Further into chapter 38, Gangleri asks if Óðinn consumes the same meals as the einherjar. High responds that Óðinn gives the food on his table to his two wolves Geri and Freki, and that Óðinn himself needs no food, for Óðinn gains sustenance from wine as if it were drink and meat. High then quotes another stanza from &quot;Grímnismál&quot; in reference. In chapter 39, Gangleri asks what the einherjar drink that is as plentiful as their food, and if they drink water. High responds that it is strange that Gangleri is asking if Óðinn, the All-Father, would invite kings, earls, and other &quot;men of rank&quot; to his home and give them water to drink. High says that he &quot;swears by his faith&quot; that many who come to Valhalla would think that he paid a high price for a drink of water if there were no better beverages there, after having died of wounds and in agony. High continues that atop Valhalla stands the goat Heiðrún, and it feeds on the foliage of the tree called Læraðr. From Heiðrún&#x27;s udders flow mead that fills a vat a day. The vat is so large that all of the einherjar are able to drink to their fullness from it.

In chapter 40, Gangleri says that Valhalla must be an immense building, yet it must often be crowded around the doorways. High responds that there are plenty of doors, and that crowding doesn&#x27;t occur around them. In support, High again quotes a stanza from &quot;Grímnismál&quot;. In chapter 41, Gangleri notes that there are very many people in Valhalla, and that Óðinn is a &quot;very great lord when he commands such a troop&quot;. Gangleri then asks what entertainment the einherjar have when they&#x27;re not drinking. High responds that every day, the einherjar get dressed and &quot;put on war-gear and go out into the courtyard and fight each other and fall upon each other. This is their sport.&quot; High says that when dinner time arrives, the einherjar ride back to Valhalla and sit down to drink. In reference, High quotes a stanza from &quot;Grímnismál&quot;.

In chapter 51, High foretells the events of Ragnarök. After the god Heimdallr awakens all the gods by blowing his horn Gjallarhorn, they will assemble at a thing, Óðinn will ride to the well Mímisbrunnr and consult Mímir on behalf of himself and his people, the world tree Yggdrasil will shake, and then the Æsir and the einherjar will don their war gear. The Æsir and einherjar will ride to the field Vígríðr while Óðinn rides before them clad in a golden helmet, mail, and holding his spear Gungnir, and heading towards the wolf Fenrir. 

In chapter 52, Gangleri asks what will happen after the heavens, earth, and all of the world are burned and the gods, einherjar and all of mankind have died, noting that he had previously been told that &quot;everyone will live in some world or other for ever and ever.&quot; High replies with a list of locations, and then describes the re-emerging of the world after Ragnarök. The einherjar receive a final mention in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; in chapter 2 of the book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, where a quote from the anonymous 10th century poem &quot;Eiríksmál&quot; is provided (see the &quot; Fagrskinna&quot; section below for more detail and another translation from another source):

===&quot;Heimskringla&quot;===

At the end of the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; saga &quot;Hákonar saga góða&quot;, the poem &quot;Hákonarmál&quot; (by the 10th century skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir) is presented. The saga relates that king Haakon I of Norway died in battle, and yet though he is Christian, he requests that since he has died &quot;among heathens, then give me such burial place as seems most fitting to you.&quot; The saga relates that, shortly after, Haakon died on the same slab of rock that he was born upon, that he was greatly mourned by friend and foe alike, and that his friends moved his body northward to Sæheim in North Hordaland. Haakon was there buried in a large burial mound in full armor and his finest clothing, yet with no other valuables. Further, &quot;words were spoken over his grave according to the custom of heathen men, and they put him on the way to Valhalla.&quot; The poem &quot;Hákonarmál&quot; is then provided.

In &quot;Hákonarmál&quot;, Óðinn sends forth the two valkyries Göndul and Skögul to &quot;choose among the kings&#x27; kinsmen&quot; and who in battle should dwell with Óðinn in Valhalla. A battle rages with great slaughter. Haakon and his men die in battle, and they see the valkyrie Göndul leaning on a spear shaft. Göndul comments that &quot;groweth now the gods&#x27; following, since Hákon has been with host so goodly bidden home with holy godheads.&quot; Haakon hears &quot;what the valkyries said,&quot; and the valkyries are described as sitting &quot;high-hearted on horseback,&quot; wearing helmets, carrying shields and that the horses wisely bore them. A brief exchange follows between Haakon and the valkyrie Skögul:

Skögul says that they shall now ride forth to the &quot;green homes of the godheads&quot; to tell Óðinn that the king will come to Valhalla. In Valhalla, Haakon is greeted by Hermóðr and Bragi. Haakon expresses concern that he shall receive Óðinn&#x27;s hate (Lee Hollander theorizes this may be due to Haakon&#x27;s conversion to Christianity from his Norse religion), yet Bragi responds that he is welcome:

===&quot;Fagrskinna&quot;===
In chapter 8 of &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;, a prose narrative states that, after the death of her husband Eric Bloodaxe, Gunnhild Mother of Kings had a poem composed about him. The composition is by an anonymous author from the 10th century and is referred to as &quot;Eiríksmál&quot;, and describes Eric Bloodaxe and five other kings arriving in Valhalla after their death. The poem begins with comments by Óðinn:

The god Bragi asks where a thundering sound is coming from, and says that the benches of Valhalla are creaking—as if the god Baldr had returned to Valhalla—and that it sounds like the movement of a thousand. Óðinn responds that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe, who will soon arrive in Valhalla. Óðinn tells the heroes Sigmund and Sinfjötli to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall, if it is indeed he.

Sigmund asks Óðinn why he would expect Eric more than any other king, to which Óðinn responds that Eric has reddened his gore-drenched sword with many other lands. Eric arrives, and Sigmund greets him, tells him that he is welcome to come into the hall, and asks him what other lords he has brought with him to Valhalla. Eric says that with him are five kings, that he will tell them the name of them all, and that he, himself, is the sixth.

==Theories and proposed etymological connections==
According to John Lindow, Andy Orchard, and Rudolf Simek, scholars have commonly connected the einherjar to the Harii, a Germanic tribe attested by Tacitus in his 1st-century AD work &quot;Germania&quot;.
Tacitus writes:
:As for the Harii, quite apart from their strength, which exceeds that of the other tribes I have just listed, they pander to their innate savagery by skill and timing: with black shields and painted bodies, they choose dark nights to fight, and by means of terror and shadow of a ghostly army they cause panic, since no enemy can bear a sight so unexpected and hellish; in every battle the eyes are the first to be conquered.
Lindow says that &quot;many scholars think there may be basis for the myth in an ancient Odin cult, which would be centered on young warriors who entered into an ecstatic relationship with Odin and that the name &quot;Harii&quot; has been etymologically connected to the &quot;-herjar&quot; element of &quot;einherjar&quot;. Simek says that since the connection has become widespread, &quot;one tends to interpret these obviously living armies of the dead as religiously motivated bands of warriors, who led to the formation of the concept of the &quot;einherjar&quot; as well as the Wild Hunt [...]&quot;. Simek continues that the notion of an eternal battle and daily resurrection appears in book I of Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; and in reports of the eternal battle of Hjaðningavíg.

According to Guðbrandur Vigfússon (1874), the concept of the einherjar links directly to the Old Norse name &quot;Einarr&quot;. Vigfússon comments that &quot;the name Einarr is properly = einheri&quot;, and points to a relation to the term with the Old Norse common nouns &quot;einarðr&quot; (meaning &quot;bold&quot;) and &quot;einörð&quot; (meaning &quot;valour&quot;).

<doc id="87927" wikidata="Q58771" url="?curid=87927" title="Apache County, Arizona">
<text>Apache County is a county in the northeast corner of the U.S. state of Arizona. Shaped in a long rectangle running north to south, as of the 2020 census, its population was 66,021. The county seat is St. Johns.

Most of the county is occupied by part of the federally recognized Navajo Nation and the Fort Apache Indian Reservation.

==History==
The United States acquired this territory following its victory in the Mexican–American War in 1848. It was originally part of the New Mexico Territory established at the time. In 1863, during the American Civil War, Congress established the Arizona Territory to improve regional administration. It operated until 1912 when it was admitted as a state.

In 1879 the Tenth Territorial Legislature organized Apache County from the eastern section of Yavapai County; officially all land east of 109°45′ W was included in the new county. As population increased in the area, by 1895, the legislature divided this county to create Navajo County and assigned some of the lands to the newly organized Graham, Greenlee and Gila counties. The county seat was first designated as the town of Snowflake, but a year later it was moved to St. Johns. From 1880 to 1882, the county seat was temporarily in Springerville, before being returned to St. Johns.

An 1896 history of the area described the county by the following:
Apache County was created in 1879 and lies in the northeastern corner of the Territory. Until March, 1895, it also embraced what is now Navajo County, but at that date the latter was set apart and established as a separate county. Apache County is justly noted for its great natural resources and advantages. It is destined some day in the early future to have a large agricultural population. Now, immense herds of cattle and flocks of sheep roam over its broad mesas and its fertile valleys. The Navajo Indians occupy the northern part of the county-in fact, occupy much of the remainder of the county, as they refuse to remain on their reservation, preferring to drive their sheep and cattle on lands outside their reservation, where the grazing is better. The southern part is a fine grazing country, while the northern part is cut up into picturesque gorges and canyons by the floods of past centuries.

In the late 1880s, the county sheriff was Commodore Perry Owens, a legendary Old West gunfighter. At that time, the county covered more than in territory. In September 1887, near Holbrook in what is now Navajo County, Owens was involved in a famous gunfight: he killed three men and wounded a fourth while serving a warrant on outlaw Andy Blevins/Andy Cooper, a participant in a raging range war, later dubbed the Pleasant Valley War.

In 2015, Apache County had the highest rate of deaths due to motor vehicles in the United States, with 82.5 deaths per 100,000 people.

The Fort Apache Indian Reservation occupies part of the county, as does the Navajo Nation, whose territory extends well beyond it. The Apache and Navajo Nation are federally recognized tribes that long occupied territory here.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.2%) is water. The county is the third-largest county by area in Arizona and the sixth-largest in the United States (excluding boroughs and census areas in Alaska).

Apache County contains parts of each of the Navajo Indian Reservation and the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, and landholdings of the Zuni Indian Reservation that are not contiguous to their main territory. It also contains part of Petrified Forest National Park. Canyon de Chelly National Monument is entirely within the county and within the boundaries of the Navajo Nation.

Apache County is one of three U.S. counties (the others being Wayne County, West Virginia and Cook County, Illinois) to border two counties of the same name, neither of which is in the same state as the county itself (San Juan County, Utah and San Juan County, New Mexico).

===Indian reservations===
Apache County has the most land designated as Indian reservation of any county in the United States. (Coconino County and Navajo County are a close second and third.) The county has of reservation territory, or 68.34 percent of its total area. The reservations are, in descending order of area within the county, the Navajo Nation, the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, and the Zuni Indian Reservation, all of which are partly located within the county.

==Politics==
Apache County has been a Democratic stronghold for over 40 years; prior to this, it was a swing county. The Navajo Nation, as well as part of the Fort Apache Reservation, both lie within the county and traditionally support Democratic candidates, overruling St. Johns, Springerville-Eagar, and Alpine which are all Republican-leaning. No Republican presidential nominee has won Apache County since Ronald Reagan in 1980, when incumbent President Jimmy Carter was viewed as extremely weak on issues pertaining to the West, especially water development. During most of the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, Apache was the most Democratic county in Arizona. In 2024, however, Apache County shifted heavily to the right alongside most other majority Native American counties in the country. The strongest Republican trends in the county lay in the Navajo and Fort Apache Reservations, which in some areas shifted by as much as 10 percentage points. After failing to narrow his margin in 2020, Donald Trump achieved the best result for a Republican since 1984, holding the Democrat&#x27;s vote share below 60% for the first time since that same year and cutting his margin of loss nearly in half.

Coconino County has trended towards the Democratic Party in modern times after being a Republican stronghold between the 1950s and 1980s. It was won by every Republican presidential nominee between 1952 and 1988; however, no Republican since George H. W. Bush in 1988 has managed to come within 6% of reclaiming the county. It is the only county from any state west of the Mississippi Riverapart from Black Belt Madison Parish, which is directly adjacent to that riverthat voted for Barry Goldwater in 1964 but has since voted for the Democratic nominee in the eight most recent presidential elections.
The Flagstaff area is a Democratic stronghold, along with all the Indian Reservations (though some of these saw Republican trends in 2024), and the city of Sedona also leans Democratic. The Havasupai Reservation is the most Democratic area in the county, having voted close to 90% Democratic in the 2024 election. The cities of Williams and Page and surrounding areas, on the other hand, trend Republican.

<text>Cochise County ( ) is a county in the southeastern corner of the U.S. state of Arizona. It is named after Cochise, a Chiricahua Apache who was a key war leader during the Apache Wars.

The population was 125,447 at the 2020 census. The county seat is Bisbee and the most populous city is Sierra Vista.

Cochise County includes the Sierra Vista-Douglas, Arizona Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county borders southwestern New Mexico and the northwestern Mexican state of Sonora.

==History==

In 1528, Spanish explorers Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, Estevanico, and Fray Marcos de Niza survived a shipwreck off the Texas coast. Captured by Native Americans, they spent eight years finding their way back to Mexico City, via the San Pedro Valley. Their journals, maps, and stories led to the Cibola, seven cities of gold myth. The Expedition of Francisco Vásquez de Coronado in 1539 using it as his route north through what they called the Guachuca Mountains of Pima (Tohono O&#x27;odham) lands and later part of the mission routes north, but was actually occupied by the Sobaipuri descendants of the Hohokam. They found a large Pueblo (described as a small city) between modern Benson and Whetstone, and several smaller satellite villages and smaller pueblos including ones on Fort Huachuca, Huachuca City and North Eastern Fry. About 1657 Father Kino visited the Sobaipuris just before the Apache forced most from the valley, as they were struggling to survive due to increasing Chiricahua Apache attacks as they moved into the area of Texas Canyon of the Dragoon Mountains. In 1775, Presidio Santa Cruz de Terrenate was founded on the west bank of the San Pedro River to protect the natives as well as the Spanish settlers who supplied the mission stations. The presidio was chronically short on provisions due to raids, however, and lacked personnel to adequately patrol the eastern route due to wars with France and England, so the main route north shifted west to the Santa Cruz valley, farther from the range of the Chiricahua Apache who almost exclusively controlled the area by 1821.
Cochise County was created on February 1, 1881, out of the eastern portion of Pima County. It took its name from the Chiricahua Apache war chief Cochise. The county seat was Tombstone until 1929 when it moved to Bisbee. Notable men who once held the position of County Sheriff were Johnny Behan, who served as the first sheriff of the new county, and who was one of the main characters during the events leading to and following the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Later, in 1886, Texas John Slaughter became sheriff. Lawman Jeff Milton and lawman/outlaw Burt Alvord both served as deputies under Slaughter.

A syndicated television series which aired from 1956 to 1958, &quot;The Sheriff of Cochise&quot; starring John Bromfield, was filmed on location in Cochise County. The Jimmy Stewart movie &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; and subsequent television show of the same name starring John Lupton, which also aired from 1956 to 1958, were set in Cochise County but filmed at other locations.

J.A. Jance&#x27;s Joanna Brady mystery series takes place in Cochise County, where Brady is sheriff.

Beginning in the late 1950s, the small community of Miracle Valley was the site of a series of bible colleges and similar religious organizations, founded by television evangelist A. A. Allen. In 1982, Miracle Valley and neighboring Palominas were the site of a series of escalating conflicts between a newly arrived black religious community and the county sheriff and deputies that culminated in the Miracle Valley shootout.

==Politics==
Cochise County leans strongly towards the Republican Party in presidential elections. Although Bill Clinton carried the county narrowly in 1992, it has supported the Republican nominee by large margins in every other election since 1968, except for 1996 and 1976 when Clinton and Jimmy Carter each lost only narrowly. Although the county includes the relatively liberal town of Bisbee, as well as the city of Douglas which has a large Latino population, this is outweighed by the heavily Republican tilt of the more populous Sierra Vista, which is adjacent to Fort Huachuca and thus has a heavy military presence.

 










In the United States House of Representatives, the county is mostly part of Arizona&#x27;s 6th congressional district, which is represented by Republican Juan Ciscomani. In the Arizona Legislature, the county is part of the 19th district and is represented by Republican David Gowan in the State Senate and Republicans Gail Griffin and Lupe Diaz in the State House of Representatives. This district also includes the entirety of Greenlee County, as well as portions of Pima County, Graham County, and Santa Cruz County.

<text>Gila County ( ) is a county in the central part of the U.S. state of Arizona. As of the 2020 census, the population was 53,272. The county seat is Globe.

Gila County comprises the Payson, Arizona micropolitan statistical area which is included in the greater Phoenix–Mesa, AZ combined statistical area.

Gila County contains parts of Fort Apache Indian Reservation and San Carlos Indian Reservation.

==History==
The county was formed from parts of Maricopa and Pinal counties on February 8, 1881. The boundary was then extended eastward to the San Carlos River by public petition in 1889. The original county seat was in the mining community of Globe City, now Globe.

Popular theory holds that the word &quot;Gila&quot; was derived from a Spanish contraction of Hah-quah-sa-eel, a Yuma word meaning &quot;running water which is salty&quot;.

In the 1880s, a long range war broke out in Gila County that became the most costly feud in American history, resulting in an almost complete annihilation of the families involved. The &quot;Pleasant Valley War&quot; (also sometimes called the &quot;Tonto Basin Feud&quot; or &quot;Tonto Basin War&quot;) matched the cattle-herding Grahams against the sheep-herding Tewksburys. Once partisan feelings became tense and hostilities began, Frederick Russell Burnham, who later became a celebrated scout and the inspiration for the boy scouts, was drawn into the conflict on the losing side.

Burnham shot many men in the feud, and was himself nearly killed by a bounty hunter. Tom Horn, an infamous assassin, was known to have taken part as a killer for hire, but it is unknown which side employed him. Both sides suffered fatalities. No one was ever charged or prosecuted.

In the 1960s, it was home of Gerald Gault, who was the subject of the 1967 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, &quot;in re Gault&quot;, that stated juveniles have the same rights as adults when arrested to be notified of the charges against them, the rights to attorneys, for family members to be notified of their arrests and to confront their accusers and to not be punished more harshly than adults who are convicted of the same crime, especially if an adult&#x27;s penalty for the crime would be less than that accorded a juvenile convict.

==Politics==
Historically, Gila County was a Democratic-leaning county in largely-Republican Arizona – for example, it voted for Adlai Stevenson II in 1952, Hubert Humphrey in 1968 and (very narrowly in a three-way contest) for John W. Davis in 1924. In much of the &quot;dealignment&quot; period from 1960 to 1980, when Arizona was the only state never carried by a Democrat, Gila was the second most-Democratic county in Arizona, behind massively unionized Greenlee. Only during very large Presidential landslides was Gila County carried by Republicans before 2000: indeed, apart from Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Richard Nixon in 1972, no Republican before 2000 ever carried the county by more than seven percentage points.

Since 2000, however, like Greenlee County, Gila County has trended heavily towards the Republican Party, and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 performance was the worst ever by a Democratic presidential nominee. Moreover, Barack Obama did worse here in 2008 than John Kerry did in 2004, one of a few non-Ozark or non-Appalachian counties where this occurred (possibly due to Arizona Senator John McCain&#x27;s presence on the ballot).

Gila County was covered in the papers as the site of a confluence between politics and public health as the conservatism of the county (with Democrat Joe Biden losing by 34 points in the 2020 presidential election) was considered one reason for vaccine skepticism, allowing the county to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to all adults well before other areas in the US.

The county was one of two in Arizona to vote against 2024 Arizona Proposition 139, which established a right to abortion in the state&#x27;s constitution, along with neighboring Graham County.

==History==
Joseph Knight Rogers, an early settler in the area, and a member of the Arizona Territorial Legislature, is known as the father of Graham County: he introduced the bill in the territorial legislature creating it. The new county was created from southern Apache County and eastern Pima County on March 10, 1881. Initially, the county seat was located in the city of Safford but was later moved to Solomonville in 1883. This change was undone in 1915, returning the county seat to Safford.

Graham County is named after the mountain of the same name which was, in turn, named after Lt. Col James Duncan Graham. The county was the first in Arizona to break the tradition of naming counties for Native Americans.

==Politics==
In its early days Graham County was a solidly Democratic county. It voted for the Democratic nominee in every presidential election from 1912 to 1952, being one of only four Western counties outside New Mexico to support James M. Cox in 1920, and one of only five to support John W. Davis in 1924. Since the 1950s, however, Graham has become a reliable Republican county, usually rivaling Mohave and Yavapai as the most Republican in Arizona, and sometimes, as in 2004 and 2000, being the “reddest” of all the state&#x27;s counties. No Democratic presidential nominee has carried Graham County since Lyndon B. Johnson – against Arizona native Barry Goldwater – did so in 1964, though Bill Clinton, who carried significant national rural appeal as a Democrat in the 1990s, came close in 1996.

The county was one of two in Arizona to vote against 2024 Arizona Proposition 139, which established a right to abortion in the state&#x27;s constitution, along with neighboring Gila County.

==Politics==
Greenlee County used to be the most reliably Democratic county in Arizona, owing to the presence of the copper mining industry. As the county was heavily unionized and the Democratic Party was generally the party of organized labor, Greenlee County voted for the Democratic nominee in every presidential election from the state&#x27;s admission to the Union in 1912 to 1996, being one of only seven Mountain State counties to support George McGovern in his landslide defeat against Republican Richard Nixon in 1972. Even Ronald Reagan was unable to win it in his 49 state landslide in 1984. However, in 2000, George W. Bush became the first Republican presidential candidate to win the county, and it has voted for the Republican nominee in the five elections since, giving Donald Trump 66% of the vote in 2020. The county&#x27;s turn to the GOP can likely be explained by the Democratic Party&#x27;s modern platform of environmentalism that has been perceived as anti-mining (for example, Bush&#x27;s 2000 opponent, Al Gore, was staunchly against coal mining). Greenlee County continued to shift right in 2024, with Kamala Harris becoming the first Democrat in history to fail to break 30%.











The county is located in Arizona&#x27;s 6th congressional district, which has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+3 and is represented by Republican Congressman Juan Ciscomani. In the Arizona House of Representatives it is represented by Republican Becky Nutt and Republican Drew John. In the Arizona Senate it is represented by Republican Gail Griffin.

<text>La Paz County () is the 15th county in the U.S. state of Arizona, located in the western part of the state. As of the 2020 census, its population was 16,557, making it the second-least populous county in Arizona. The county seat is Parker. The name of the county is the Spanish word for &quot;the peace&quot;, and is taken from the early settlement (now ghost town) of La Paz along the Colorado River.

==History==

La Paz County was established in 1983 after voters approved separating the northern portion of Yuma County, making it the only county to be established after Arizona became a state in 1912, and currently the second youngest county in the United States (behind the consolidated city-county of Broomfield, Colorado, which was established in 2001). The county did not have a large enough tax base to begin supporting a separate county government immediately and had to rely on state money at first. As a result, the Arizona State Legislature changed Arizona laws to make splitting other existing counties much more difficult.

Under the revised Arizona laws, a county shall not be formed or divided by county initiative unless each proposed county would have all of the following characteristics: (1) at least three-fourths of one percent of the total state assessed valuation and at least the statewide per capita assessed valuation; (2) a population of at least three-fourths of one percent of the total state population according to the most recent United States decennial census; (3) at least one hundred square miles of privately owned land; (4) common boundaries with either (a) at least three other existing or proposed counties; or (b) at least two other existing or proposed counties and the state boundary. A county formation commission is required to be formed to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed county. A proposal to divide a county must be approved by a majority of the votes cast in each proposed new county. Yet in 2022 a group of Republican state legislators, motivated largely by partisan considerations, proposed dividing Maricopa County into four counties.

The Colorado River Indian Reservation is located in the western portion of the county. Part of the reservation extends westward into San Bernardino and Riverside counties in California.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.3%) is water.

The area that now makes up La Paz County was formerly part of Yuma County.

<text>Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent ( , ; – before 5 May 1243) was an English nobleman who served as Chief Justiciar of England (1215–1232) and Justiciar of Ireland (1232) during the reigns of King John and his son and successor King Henry III and, as Regent of England (1219–1227) during Henry&#x27;s minority, was one of the most influential and powerful men in English politics in the thirteenth century.

==Origins==
Hubert de Burgh was born of unknown parents of Burgh-next-Aylsham, Norfolk. A case has been made for Hubert&#x27;s father being Walter de Burgh, and his mother was named Alice. The family were minor landholders in Norfolk and Suffolk, from whom Hubert inherited at least four manors. His elder brother was William de Burgh (d. 1206), founder of the de Burgh/Burke/Bourke dynasty in Ireland, and his younger brothers were Geoffrey (Archdeacon of Norwich and later Bishop of Ely), and Thomas (castellan of Norwich). 

==Appointments by King John==
Hubert de Burgh had entered the service of Prince John by 1198, and rose in importance in John&#x27;s administration: he served successively as chamberlain of John&#x27;s household, Ambassador to Portugal, Sheriff first of Dorset and Somerset (1200–04) and then of Berkshire (1202–04) and Cornwall (1202), custodian of the castles of Dover, Launceston and Windsor, and then of the Welsh Marches. For these services, he was granted a series of manors, baronies, and other castles, and became a powerful figure in John&#x27;s administration.
In 1202, de Burgh was sent to France by King John, to assist in the defense of Poitou against King Philip II of France. He was appointed castellan of the great castle of Chinon in Touraine. During this time, he served as guard of the captured Arthur I, Duke of Brittany. After almost all of Poitou had fallen to the French king, de Burgh held the castle for an entire year, until he was captured during the ultimately successful storming of the castle in 1205. He was held captive until 1207, during which time his royal appointments and grants of land passed to other men. Following his return to England, de Burgh did, however, acquire other offices in John&#x27;s administration. He also acquired lands scattered throughout East Anglia, South-West England, and elsewhere, making him once again an important baron in England.

In 1212, de Burgh returned to France at first as deputy seneschal of Poitou and then as seneschal (1212–1215). He served John in his efforts to recover dominions lost to Philip II of France, until the signing of a truce between John and Philip following John&#x27;s failed military campaign in France in 1214.

==Chief Justiciar of England==
Hubert de Burgh remained loyal to King John during the barons&#x27; rebellion in the last years of his reign. In the early stages of that rebellion, John sent de Burgh to London with the Bishop of Coventry, in an unsuccessful attempt to command the people of London to resist the Barons&#x27; military advance. De Burgh and Philip d&#x27;Aubigny brought together the king&#x27;s troops at Rochester, but then John made peace with the rebels. In &quot;Magna Carta&quot; (1215) de Burgh is listed as one of those who advised the king to sign, and his brother, Geoffrey (Bishop of Ely), was a witness. Hubert de Burgh is also listed as the person who would act on the king&#x27;s behalf if the king were out of the country. Soon after the issuing of &quot;Magna Carta&quot;, de Burgh was officially declared Chief Justiciar of England and Ireland.

During the First Barons&#x27; War (1215–17), Hubert de Burgh served John as sheriff of Kent (1216–25) and Surrey (1215–16), as well as castellan of Canterbury and Dover. He successfully defended Dover Castle during a siege that lasted until John died (in October 1216), and the infant King Henry III was crowned. He denied Louis VIII of France possession of the castle later in 1216. On 24 August 1217, a French fleet arrived off the coast of Sandwich in Kent, in order to provide Prince (later King) Louis of France, then ravaging England, with soldiers, siege engines and fresh supplies. Claiming command of the English fleet raised in response, Hubert intercepted the French fleet at the Battle of Sandwich, where he scattered the French and captured their flagship &quot;The Great Ship of Bayonne&quot; under Eustace the Monk, who was promptly executed. (This command has sometimes led to Hubert being included anachronistically on lists of the lord high admirals.) When the news reached Louis, he entered into fresh peace negotiations.

==Regent to Henry III==

When Henry III came of age in 1227 Hubert de Burgh was appointed Governor of Rochester Castle, lord of Montgomery Castle in the Welsh Marches, and created Earl of Kent. He remained one of the most influential people at court. On 27 April 1228, he was named Justiciar for life. He was appointed Justiciar of Ireland on 16 June 1232 but never visited Ireland and he retired from this post in August 1232.

However, in 1232, his enemies&#x27; plots finally succeeded and he was removed from office and was soon imprisoned at Devizes Castle. When Richard Marshal, 3rd Earl of Pembroke rebelled against the king in 1233, the men holding Hubert de Burgh captive released him and he subsequently joined the rebellion. In 1234, Edmund Rich, Archbishop of Canterbury, effected a reconciliation. Hubert officially resigned the Justiciarship (about 28 May 1234) and no longer exercised the power of the office after September 1232. This judgment was reversed by William de Raley (alias Raleigh) in 1234, which, for a time, restored the earldom.

==Trouble with the king==
The marriage of Hubert de Burgh&#x27;s daughter, Margaret (or Megotta as she was also known), to the young Richard of Clare, Earl of Gloucester, brought de Burgh into some trouble in 1236, for the earl was still a minor and in the king&#x27;s wardship, and the marriage had been celebrated without the royal licence. Hubert, however, protested that the match was not of his making, and promised to pay the king some money, so the matter passed by for the time. Eventually the marriage came to an end, by way of her death.

==Lands acquired==

In 1206, he purchased the manor of Tunstall in Kent (from Robert de Arsic) which was later inherited by his eldest son, John de Burgh.

Hubert was appointed Constable of Dover Castle and was also given charge of Falaise, in Normandy. At Falaise he was the gaoler of Arthur I, Duke of Brittany, the nephew of King John and boy claimant to the English throne. Arthur may or may not have been murdered after leaving de Burgh&#x27;s custody; his fate is unknown.

At some time before 1215, Hubert de Burgh is cited as having been appointed Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports (1215–20), which position later (after the Barons&#x27; War) included the ex officio constableship of Dover Castle. In the case of de Burgh, however, a rather long period seems to have elapsed between the two appointments.

Sometime after 1215, De Burgh started building a castle in Hadleigh having been awarded the lands by King John. A licence to crenellate was retrospectively given in 1230, at which point that original castle had been completed. After falling out with King Henry III, De Burgh was stripped of Hadleigh Castle. The castle was claimed by the monarchy and stayed in royal hands until being sold (with much of the stonework dismantled and sold) in 1551. The castle later suffered from several landslips, and the ruins are currently owned by English Heritage.

==Marriages==
Hubert was initially betrothed to Joan de Redvers (daughter of William de Redvers, 5th Earl of Devon), but the marriage never took place and she later married William Brewer II (d. 1232), eldest surviving son and heir of William Brewer (d. 1226), who was a prominent administrator and judge during the reigns of Richard I, John and Henry III.

Hubert de Burgh married three times:
* Firstly, Beatrice (daughter of William de Warrenne) with whom he had two sons: Sir John (whose descendant, Margaret, married Richard Óg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster) and Sir Hubert (ancestor of Thomas Burgh of Gainsborough).
* Secondly (September 1217), Isabella, Countess of Gloucester (daughter and heiress of William FitzRobert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester).
* Thirdly, Princess Margaret (sister of King Alexander II of Scotland) with whom he had a daughter, Margaret, who married Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester.

== Death ==
Hubert de Burgh died in Banstead, Surrey, in 1243, and was buried in the Church of the Friars Preachers (commonly called Black Friars) in Holborn, London.

His sons did not inherit his earldom, as the inheritance of the earldom was restricted to descendants of Hubert and his third wife, possibly because Henry III granted the title on account of Hubert marrying a Scottish princess.

==Fictional portrayals==
Hubert is a character in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;King John&quot;. On screen, he has been portrayed by Franklyn McLeay in the silent short &quot;King John&quot; (1899), which recreates John&#x27;s death scene; by Jonathan Adams in the BBC TV drama series &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Crown&quot; (1978); and by John Thaw in the BBC Shakespeare version of &quot;The Life and Death of King John&quot; (1984). The story of his daughter&#x27;s marriage is told in Edith Pargeter&#x27;s novel &quot;The Marriage of Meggotta&quot; (1979).

==Government, policing, and politics==
===Government===
The governing body of Maricopa County is its board of supervisors. The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors consists of five members chosen by popular vote within their own districts. the board consists of four Republicans and one Democrat. Each member serves a four-year term, with no term limits.

===Maricopa County sheriff===
The Maricopa County Sheriff&#x27;s Office provides court protection, administers the county jail, and patrols the unincorporated areas of the county plus incorporated towns by contract.

===Politics===
For much of the time after World War II, Maricopa County was one of the more conservative urban counties in the United States. While the city of Phoenix has historically leaned Republican, most of the rest of the county was more conservative. Until 2020, every Republican presidential candidate since 1952 had carried Maricopa County. This includes the 1964 presidential run of native son Barry Goldwater, who would not have carried his own state had it not been for a 21,000-vote margin in Maricopa County. Until 2020, it was the largest county in the country to vote Republican. From 1968 to 2016, Democrats held the margin within single digits only three times–in 1992, 1996, and 2016. In 2020, Joe Biden became the first Democrat in 72 years to win the county, which flipped Arizona to the Democratic column for the first time since 1996 and only the second time since 1948. Furthermore, Biden became the first presidential candidate to win more than one million votes in the county. This makes Maricopa County the third county in American history to cast more than one million votes for a presidential candidate. The county is also a statewide bellwether, voting for the statewide winning candidate in all elections except 1996. In 2024 however, Trump was able to flip the county back as he carried Arizona in that election due to his increase in support among Hispanics in Phoenix and its suburbs.

Despite its consistent Republican allegiance since 1952, its fast-growing Hispanic population and influx of conservative retirees and Mormons, which were traditionally conservative voting blocs but were increasingly skeptical of President Donald Trump, signaled that it was a crucial bellwether in the 2020 election.












Despite its political leanings at the time, Maricopa County voted against Proposition 107 in the 2006 election. This referendum, designed to ban gay marriage and restrict domestic partner benefits, was rejected by a 51.6–48.4% margin within the county, and statewide by a similar margin. Two years later, however, a majority of county residents voted to pass a more limited constitutional amendment Proposition 102 to ban same-sex marriage but not state-recognized civil unions or domestic partnerships. The amendment was later invalidated by the Supreme Court&#x27;s 2015 ruling in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, which declared that same-sex marriage is a fundamental right in the United States.

Unlike cities and towns in Arizona, counties are politically and legally subordinate to the state and do not have charters of their own. The county Board of Supervisors acts under powers delegated by state law, mainly related to minor ordinances and revenue collection. With few exceptions, these powers are narrowly construed. The chairperson of the board presides for a one-year term, selected by the board members during a public hearing.

The county sheriff, county attorney, county assessor, county treasurer, superintendent of schools, county recorder, constables, justices of the peace, and clerk of the Superior Court are elected by the people. Retention of Superior Court judges is also determined by popular vote.

The county&#x27;s dominant political figure for over two decades (from 1993 to 2017) was Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who called himself &quot;America&#x27;s Toughest Sheriff&quot; and gained national notoriety for his flamboyant and often controversial practices and policies.

Maricopa County is home to 62 percent of the state&#x27;s population and therefore dominates Arizona&#x27;s politics. For example, in the 2018 Senate election, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema carried the county en route to becoming the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in Arizona since 1988. She won the county by over 60,000 votes, more than enough for the victory; she won statewide by 55,900 votes. All but one of the state&#x27;s nine congressional districts include part of the county, and five of the districts have their population center located there. Most of the state&#x27;s prominent elected officials live in the county. Further underlining Maricopa County&#x27;s political dominance, Biden&#x27;s margin of 45,109 votes was more than enough to carry the state; he only won Arizona by 10,457 votes.

Conversely, in the 2024 General Election, former president Donald Trump won Maricopa County by 71,515 votes and won the state of Arizona by 187,382 votes, making the 5.5 percent statewide victory the largest percentage win of any of the seven 2024 swing states.

<text>A terminator or twilight zone is a moving line that divides the daylit side and the dark night side of a planetary body. The terminator is defined as the locus of points on a planet or moon where the line through the center of its parent star is tangent. An observer on the terminator of such an orbiting body with an atmosphere would experience twilight due to light scattering by particles in the gaseous layer.

==Earth&#x27;s terminator==
On Earth, the terminator is a circle with a diameter that is approximately that of Earth. The terminator passes through any point on Earth&#x27;s surface twice a day, at sunrise and at sunset, apart from polar regions where this only occurs when the point is not experiencing midnight sun or polar night. The circle separates the portion of Earth experiencing daylight from that experiencing darkness (night). While a little over one half of Earth is illuminated at any point in time (with exceptions during eclipses), the terminator path varies by time of day due to Earth&#x27;s rotation on its axis. The terminator path also varies by time of year due to Earth&#x27;s orbital revolution around the Sun; thus, the plane of the terminator is nearly parallel to planes created by lines of longitude during the equinoxes, and its maximum angle is approximately 23.5° to the pole during the solstices.

===Surface transit speed===

At the equator, under flat conditions (without obstructions like mountains or at a height above any such obstructions), the terminator moves at approximately . This speed can appear to increase when near obstructions, such as the height of a mountain, as the shadow of the obstruction will be cast over the ground in advance of the terminator along a flat landscape. The speed of the terminator decreases as it approaches the poles, where it can reach a speed of zero (full-day sunlight or darkness).

Supersonic aircraft like jet fighters or Concorde and Tupolev Tu-144 supersonic transports are the only aircraft able to overtake the maximum speed of the terminator at the equator. However, slower vehicles can overtake the terminator at higher latitudes, and it is possible to walk faster than the terminator at the poles, near to the equinoxes. The visual effect is that of seeing the sun rise in the west, or set in the east.

===Grey-line radio propagation===
Strength of radio propagation changes between day- and night-side of the ionosphere. This is primarily because the D layer, which absorbs high frequency signals, disappears rapidly on the dark side of the terminator, whereas the E and F layers above the D layer take longer to form. This time-difference puts the ionosphere into a unique intermediate state along the terminator, called the &quot;grey line&quot;.

Amateur radio operators take advantage of conditions along the terminator to perform long-distance communications. Called &quot;gray-line&quot; or &quot;grey-line&quot; propagation, this signal path is a type of skywave propagation. Under good conditions, radio waves can travel along the terminator to antipodal points.

==Lunar terminator==


The lunar terminator is the division between the illuminated and dark hemispheres of the Moon. It is the lunar equivalent of the division between night and day on the Earth spheroid, although the Moon&#x27;s much lower rate of rotation means it takes longer for it to pass across the surface. At the equator, it moves at , as fast as an athletic human can run on earth.

Due to the angle at which sunlight strikes this portion of the Moon, shadows cast by craters and other geological features are elongated, thereby making such features more apparent to the observer. This phenomenon is similar to the lengthening of shadows on Earth when the Sun is low in the sky. For this reason, much lunar photographic study centers on the illuminated area near the lunar terminator, and the resulting shadows provide accurate descriptions of the lunar terrain.

===Lunar terminator illusion===
The lunar terminator (or tilt) illusion is an optical illusion arising from the expectation of an observer on Earth that the direction of sunlight illuminating the Moon (i.e. a line perpendicular to the terminator) should correspond with the position of the Sun, but does not appear to do so. The illusion results from misinterpreting the arrangement of objects in the sky according to intuition based on planar geometry.

==Scientific significance==
Examination of a terminator can yield information about the surface of a planetary body; for example, the presence of an atmosphere can create a fuzzier terminator. As the particles within an atmosphere are at a higher elevation, the light source can remain visible even after it has set at ground level. These particles scatter the light, reflecting some of it to the ground. Hence, the sky can remain illuminated even after the sun has set. Images showing a planetary terminator can be used to map topography: the position of the tip of a mountain behind the terminator line is measured when the Sun still or already illuminates it while the base of the mountain remains in shadow. 

Low Earth orbit satellites take advantage of the fact that certain polar orbits set near the terminator do not suffer from eclipse, therefore their solar cells are continuously lit by sunlight. Such orbits are called dawn-dusk orbits, a type of Sun-synchronous orbit. This prolongs the operational life of a LEO satellite, as onboard battery life is prolonged. It also enables specific experiments that require minimum interference from the Sun, as the designers can opt to install the relevant sensors on the dark side of the satellite.

<text>Mohave County occupies the northwestern corner of the U.S. state of Arizona, one of 15 counties in the state. As of the 2020 census, its population was 213,267. The county seat is Kingman, and the largest city is Lake Havasu City. It is the fifth largest county in the United States (by area).

Mohave County makes up the Lake Havasu City–Kingman, Arizona Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Mohave County contains parts of Grand Canyon National Park and Lake Mead National Recreation Area and all of the Grand Canyon–Parashant National Monument. The Kaibab, Fort Mojave and Hualapai Indian Reservations also lie within the county.

==History==
Mohave County was the one of four original Arizona Counties created by the 1st Arizona Territorial Legislature. The county territory was originally defined as being west of longitude 113° 20&#x27; and north of the Bill Williams River. Pah-Ute County was created from it in 1865 and was merged back into Mohave County in 1871 when much of its territory was ceded to Nevada in 1866. The county&#x27;s present boundaries were established in 1881. The county is also notable for being home to a large polygamous Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints sect located in Colorado City.

Mohave County has had five county seats: Mohave City (1864–1867), Hardyville (1867–1873), Cerbat (1873–1877), Mineral Park (1877–1887), and Kingman (1887–present).

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.1%) is water. It is the second-largest county by area in Arizona and the fifth-largest in the contiguous United States.

The county consists of two sections divided by the Grand Canyon, with no direct land connection between them. The northern section, smaller and less populated, forms the western part of the Arizona Strip, bordering Utah and Nevada. The larger southern section borders Nevada and California across the Colorado River, which forms most of the county&#x27;s western boundary. The southern section includes Kingman, the county seat, and other cities, as well as part of the Mojave Desert.

===Adjacent counties===
* Washington County, Utah – north
* Kane County, Utah – northeast
* Coconino County – east
* Yavapai County – east
* La Paz County – south
* San Bernardino County, California – southwest
* Clark County, Nevada – west
* Lincoln County, Nevada – northwest

Mohave County and its adjacent counties form the largest such block of counties outside of Alaska. Their combined land area is , or larger than that of the state of Idaho. They include the #1 (San Bernardino), #2 (Coconino), #5 (Mohave), and #7 (Lincoln) largest counties outside of Alaska. If Nye County, Nevada- which is #3 for total county area that does not border Mohave but borders neighboring Lincoln and Clark counties is included, then the combined land area would be 107,726.34 squard miles or larger than the state of Colorado.

===National protected areas===
* Bill Williams River National Wildlife Refuge (part)
* Grand Canyon National Park (part)
* Grand Canyon–Parashant National Monument
* Havasu National Wildlife Refuge (part)

==Politics, government, and infrastructure==
Since 2008, Mohave has taken over from Graham and Yavapai as the “reddest” county in the state, and in 2024, it stood as such by twenty-one percentage points. No Democratic presidential nominee has carried Mohave County since Lyndon Johnson, who, despite the home state advantage of Arizona native Barry Goldwater, did so in 1964, by a margin of only 152 votes. In the 1990s, Bill Clinton came very close to winning this county, if not because of a combination of significant nationwide rural appeal and third-party candidate Ross Perot&#x27;s Western appeal himself. In 1992, Clinton only lost the county by fewer than 430 votes. Four years later, he lost by just over 1,200 votes; no Democrat since then has managed even 40 percent of the county&#x27;s vote.

In recent elections it has become common for Democratic nominees to receive less than thirty percent of the county&#x27;s vote, with Kamala Harris in 2024 received less than 22 percent of the vote. In 2024, Donald Trump received 77.4% of the vote in Mohave County. 

According to Ballotpedia, Mohave County makes up 2.98% of Arizona&#x27;s voting percentage. 











The Mohave County Administration Building is located in downtown Kingman at 700 West Beale Street.

<text>In mathematics, Sharkovskii&#x27;s theorem (also spelled Sharkovsky, Sharkovskiy, Šarkovskii or Sarkovskii), named after Oleksandr Mykolayovych Sharkovsky, who published it in 1964, is a result about discrete dynamical systems. One of the implications of the theorem is that if a discrete dynamical system on the real line has a periodic point of period 3, then it must have periodic points of every other period.

==Statement==
For some interval formula_1, suppose that
formula_2
is a continuous function. The number formula_3 is called a &quot;periodic point of period formula_4&quot; if formula_5, where formula_6 denotes the iterated function obtained by composition of formula_4 copies of formula_8. The number formula_3 is said to have &quot;least period formula_4&quot; if, in addition, formula_11 for all formula_12. Sharkovskii&#x27;s theorem concerns the possible least periods of periodic points of formula_8. Consider the following ordering of the positive integers, sometimes called the Sharkovskii ordering:
formula_14

It consists of:
* the odd numbers &quot;excluding&quot; formula_15 formula_16 in &quot;increasing&quot; order,
* 2 times the odd numbers formula_17 in &quot;increasing&quot; order,
* 4 times the odd numbers formula_18 in &quot;increasing&quot; order,
* 8 times the odd numbers formula_19,
* etc. formula_20
* finally, the powers of two formula_21 in &quot;decreasing&quot; order.

This ordering is a total order: every positive integer appears exactly once somewhere on this list. However, it is not a well-order. In a well-order, every subset would have an earliest element, but in this order there is no earliest power of two.

Sharkovskii&#x27;s theorem states that if formula_8 has a periodic point of least period formula_4, and formula_4 precedes formula_25 in the above ordering, then formula_8 has also a periodic point of least period formula_25.

One consequence is that if formula_8 has only finitely many periodic points, then they must all have periods that are powers of two. Furthermore, if there is a periodic point of period three, then there are periodic points of all other periods.

Sharkovskii&#x27;s theorem does not state that there are &quot;stable&quot; cycles of those periods, just that there are cycles of those periods. For systems such as the logistic map, the bifurcation diagram shows a range of parameter values for which apparently the only cycle has period 3. In fact, there must be cycles of all periods there, but they are not stable and therefore not visible on the computer-generated picture.

The assumption of continuity is important. Without this assumption, the discontinuous piecewise linear function formula_29 defined as:
formula_30
for which every value has period 3, would be a counterexample. Similarly essential is the assumption of formula_8 being defined on an interval. Otherwise formula_32, which is defined on real numbers except the one: formula_33 and for which every non-zero value has period 3, would be a counterexample.

==Generalizations and related results==

Sharkovskii also proved the converse theorem: every upper set of the above order is the set of periods for some continuous function from an interval to itself. In fact all such sets of periods are achieved by the family of functions formula_34, formula_35 for formula_36, except for the empty set of periods which is achieved by formula_37, formula_38.

On the other hand, with additional information on the combinatorial structure of the interval map acting on the points in a periodic orbit, a period-n point may force period-3 (and hence all periods). Namely, if the orbit type (the cyclic permutation generated by the map acting on the points in the periodic orbit) has a so-called stretching pair, then this implies the existence of a periodic point of period-3. It can be shown (in an asymptotic sense) that almost all cyclic permutations admit at least one stretching pair, and hence almost all orbit types imply period-3.

Tien-Yien Li and James A. Yorke showed in 1975 that not only does the existence of a period-3 cycle imply the existence of cycles of all periods, but in addition it implies the existence of an uncountable infinitude of points that never map to any cycle (chaotic points)—a property known as period three implies chaos.

Sharkovskii&#x27;s theorem does not immediately apply to dynamical systems on other topological spaces. It is easy to find a circle map with periodic points of period 3 only: take a rotation by 120 degrees, for example. But some generalizations are possible, typically involving the mapping class group of the space minus a periodic orbit. For example, Peter Kloeden showed that Sharkovskii&#x27;s theorem holds for triangular mappings, i.e., mappings for which the component depends only on the first components .
