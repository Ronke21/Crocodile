<text>In European academic traditions, fine art (or, fine arts) is made primarily for aesthetics or creative expression, distinguishing it from popular art, decorative art or applied art, which also either serve some practical function (such as pottery or most metalwork) or is generally of limited artistic quality in order to appeal to the masses. In the aesthetic theories developed in the Italian Renaissance, the highest art was that which allowed the full expression and display of the artist&#x27;s imagination, unrestricted by any of the practical considerations involved in, say, making and decorating a teapot. It was also considered important that making the artwork did not involve dividing the work between different individuals with specialized skills, as might be necessary with a piece of furniture, for example. Even within the fine arts, there was a hierarchy of genres based on the amount of creative imagination required, with history painting placed higher than still life.

Historically, the five main fine arts were painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and poetry. Other &quot;minor or subsidiary arts&quot; were also included, especially performing arts such as theatre and dance, which were counted as &quot;among the most ancient and universal.&quot; In practice, outside education, the concept is typically only applied to the visual arts. The old master print and drawing were included as related forms to painting, just as prose forms of literature were to poetry. Today, the range of what would be considered fine arts (in so far as the term remains in use) is commonly includes additional modern forms, such as film, photography, and video production/editing, as well as traditional forms made in a fine art setting, such as studio pottery and studio glass, with equivalents in other materials.

One definition of &quot;fine art&quot; is &quot;a visual art considered to have been created primarily for aesthetic and intellectual purposes and judged for its beauty and meaningfulness, specifically, painting, sculpture, drawing, watercolor, graphics, and architecture.&quot; In that sense, there are conceptual differences between the fine arts and the decorative arts or applied arts (these two terms covering largely the same media). As far as the consumer of the art was concerned, the perception of aesthetic qualities required a refined judgment usually referred to as having good taste, which differentiated fine art from popular art and entertainment.

The word &quot;fine&quot; does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional European canons. Except in the case of architecture, where a practical utility was accepted, this definition originally excluded the &quot;useful&quot; applied or decorative arts, and the products of what were regarded as crafts. In contemporary practice, these distinctions and restrictions have become essentially meaningless, as the concept or intention of the artist is given primacy, regardless of the means through which it is expressed.

The term is typically only used for Western art from the Renaissance onwards, although similar genre distinctions can apply to the art of other cultures, especially those of East Asia. The set of &quot;fine arts&quot; are sometimes also called the &quot;major arts&quot;, with &quot;minor arts&quot; equating to the decorative arts. This would typically be for medieval and ancient art.

== Origins, history and development ==
According to some writers, the concept of a distinct category of fine art is an invention of the early modern period in the West. Larry Shiner in his &quot;The Invention of Art: A Cultural History&quot; (2003) locates the invention in the 18th century:
&quot;There was a traditional &quot;system of the arts&quot; in the West before the eighteenth century. (Other traditional cultures still have a similar system.) In that system, an artist or artisan was a skilled maker or practitioner, a work of art was the useful product of skilled work, and the appreciation of the arts was integrally connected with their role in the rest of life. &quot;Art&quot;, in other words, meant approximately the same thing as the Greek word &quot;techne&quot;, or in English &quot;skill&quot;, a sense that has survived in phrases like &quot;the art of war&quot;, &quot;the art of love&quot;, and &quot;the art of medicine&quot;.
Similar ideas have been expressed by Paul Oskar Kristeller, Pierre Bourdieu, and Terry Eagleton (e.g. &quot;The Ideology of the Aesthetic&quot;), though the point of invention is often placed earlier, in the Italian Renaissance; Anthony Blunt notes that the term &quot;arti di disegno&quot;, a similar concept, emerged in Italy in the mid-16th century.

But it can be argued that the classical world, from which very little theoretical writing on art survives, in practice had similar distinctions. The names of artists preserved in literary sources are Greek painters and sculptors, and to a lesser extent the carvers of engraved gems. Several individuals in these groups were very famous, and copied and remembered for centuries after their deaths. The cult of the individual artistic genius, which was an important part of the Renaissance theoretical basis for the distinction between &quot;fine&quot; and other art, drew on classical precedent, especially as recorded by Pliny the Elder. Some other types of object, in particular Ancient Greek pottery, are often signed by their makers or the owner of the workshop, probably partly to advertise their products.

The decline of the concept of &quot;fine art&quot; is dated by George Kubler and others to around 1880. When it &quot;fell out of fashion&quot; as, by about 1900, folk art was also coming to be regarded as significant. Finally, at least in circles interested in art theory, &quot;&quot;fine art&quot; was driven out of use by about 1920 by the exponents of industrial design ... who opposed a double standard of judgment for works of art and for useful objects&quot;. This was among theoreticians; it has taken far longer for the art trade and popular opinion to catch up. However, over the same period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the movement of prices in the art market was in the opposite direction, with works from the fine arts drawing much further ahead of those from the decorative arts.

In the art trade the term retains some currency for objects from before roughly 1900 and may be used to define the scope of auctions or auction house departments and the like. The term also remains in use in tertiary education, appearing in the names of colleges, faculties, and courses. In the English-speaking world this is mostly in North America, but the same is true of the equivalent terms in other European languages, such as &quot;beaux-arts&quot; in French or &quot;bellas artes&quot; in Spanish.

== Cultural perspectives ==

The conceptual separation of arts and decorative arts or crafts that have often dominated in Europe and the US is not shared by all other cultures. But traditional Chinese art had comparable distinctions, distinguishing within Chinese painting between the mostly landscape literati painting of scholar gentlemen and the artisans of the schools of court painting and sculpture. Although high status was also given to many things that would be seen as craft objects in the West, in particular ceramics, jade carving, weaving, and embroidery, this by no means extended to the workers who created these objects, who typically remained even more anonymous than in the West. Similar distinctions were made in Japanese and Korean art. In Islamic art, the highest status was generally given to calligraphy, architects and the painters of Persian miniatures and related traditions, but these were still very often court employees. Typically they also supplied designs for the best Persian carpets, architectural tiling and other decorative media, more consistently than happened in the West.

Latin American art was dominated by European colonialism until the 20th-century, when indigenous art began to reassert itself inspired by the Constructivist Movement, which reunited arts with crafts based upon socialist principles. In Africa, Yoruba art often has a political and spiritual function. As with the art of the Chinese, the art of the Yoruba is also often composed of what would ordinarily be considered in the West to be craft production. Some of its most admired manifestations, such as textiles, fall in this category.

== Visual arts ==
=== Two-dimensional works ===

==== Painting and drawing ====

Painting as a fine art means applying paint to a flat surface (as opposed for example to painting a sculpture, or a piece of pottery), typically using several colours. Prehistoric painting that has survived was applied to natural rock surfaces, and wall painting, especially on wet plaster in the fresco technique was a major form until recently. Portable paintings on wood panel or canvas have been the most important in the Western world for several centuries, mostly in tempera or oil painting. Asian painting has more often used paper, with the monochrome ink and wash painting tradition dominant in East Asia. Paintings that are intended to go in a book or album are called &quot;miniatures&quot;, whether for a Western illuminated manuscript or in Persian miniature and its Turkish equivalent, or Indian paintings of various types. Watercolour is the western version of painting in paper; forms using gouache, chalk, and similar mediums without brushes are really forms of drawing.

Drawing is one of the major forms of the visual arts, and painters need drawing skills as well. Common instruments include: graphite pencils, pen and ink, inked brushes, wax color pencils, crayons, charcoals, chalk, pastels, markers, stylus, or various metals like silverpoint. There are a number of subcategories of drawing, including cartooning and creating comics.

==== Mosaics ====

Mosaics are images formed with small pieces of stone or glass, called &quot;tesserae&quot;. They can be decorative or functional. An artist who designs and makes mosaics is called a mosaic artist or a mosaicist. Ancient Greeks and Romans created realistic mosaics. Mythological subjects, or scenes of hunting or other pursuits of the wealthy, were popular as the centrepieces of a larger geometric design, with strongly emphasized borders. Early Christian basilicas from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics. The most famous Byzantine basilicas decorated with mosaics are the Basilica of San Vitale from Ravenna (Italy) and Hagia Sophia from Istanbul (Turkey).

==== Printmaking ====
Printmaking covers the making of images on paper that can be reproduced multiple times by a printing process. It has been an important artistic medium for several centuries, in the West and East Asia. Major historic techniques include engraving, woodcut and etching in the West, and woodblock printing in East Asia, where the Japanese ukiyo-e style is the most important. The 19th-century invention of lithography and then photographic techniques have partly replaced the historic techniques. Older prints can be divided into the fine art Old Master print and popular prints, with book illustrations and other practical images such as maps somewhere in the middle.

Except in the case of monotyping, the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece, which is called a print. Each print is considered an original, as opposed to a copy. The reasoning behind this is that the print is not a reproduction of another work of art in a different medium – for instance, a painting – but rather an image designed from inception as a print. An individual print is also referred to as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, known technically as a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric in the case of screen-printing. But there are many other kinds. Multiple nearly identical prints can be called an edition. In modern times each print is often signed and numbered forming a &quot;limited edition&quot;. Prints may also be published in book form, as artist&#x27;s books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.

==== Calligraphy ====

Calligraphy is a type of visual art. A contemporary definition of calligraphic practice is &quot;the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious and skillful manner&quot;. Modern calligraphy ranges from functional hand-lettered inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the abstract expression of the handwritten mark may or may not compromise the legibility of the letters. Classical calligraphy differs from typography and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may create all of these; characters are historically disciplined yet fluid and spontaneous, improvised at the moment of writing.

==== Photography ====

&quot;Fine art photography&quot; refers to photographs that are created to fulfill the creative vision of the artist. Fine art photography stands in contrast to photojournalism and commercial photography. Photojournalism visually communicates stories and ideas, mainly in print and digital media. Fine art photography is created primarily as an expression of the artist&#x27;s vision, but has also been important in advancing certain causes.
Depiction of nudity has been one of the dominating themes in fine-art photography.

=== Three-dimensional works ===
==== Architecture ====

Architecture is frequently considered a fine art, especially if its aesthetic components are spotlighted – in contrast to structural-engineering or construction-management components. Architectural works are perceived as cultural and political symbols and works of art. Historical civilizations often are known primarily through their architectural achievements. Such buildings as the pyramids of Egypt and the Roman Colosseum are cultural symbols, and are important links in public consciousness, even when scholars have discovered much about past civilizations through other means. Cities, regions, and cultures continue to identify themselves with, and are known by, their architectural monuments.

==== Pottery ====

With some modern exceptions, pottery is not considered as fine art, but &quot;fine pottery&quot; remains a valid technical term, especially in archaeology. &quot;Fine wares&quot; are high-quality pottery, often painted, moulded or otherwise decorated, and in many periods distinguished from &quot;coarse wares&quot;, which are basic utilitarian pots used by the mass of the population, or in the kitchen rather than for more formal purposes.

Even when, as with porcelain figurines, a piece of pottery has no practical purpose, the making of it is typically a collaborative and semi-industrial one, involving many participants with different skills.

==== Sculpture ====

Sculpture is three-dimensional artwork created by shaping hard or plastic material, commonly stone (either rock or marble), metal, or wood. Some sculptures are created directly by ; others are assembled, built up and fired, welded, molded, or cast. Because sculpture involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated, it is considered one of the plastic arts. The majority of public art is sculpture. Many sculptures together in a garden setting may be referred to as a sculpture garden.

Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials, and often represents the majority of the surviving works (other than pottery) from ancient cultures; conversely, traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely. However, most ancient sculpture was brightly painted, and this has been lost.

=== Conceptual art ===
Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns.
The inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of &quot;idea-based art&quot; that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text. However, through its association with the Young British Artists and the Turner Prize during the 1990s, its popular usage, particularly in the UK, developed as a synonym for all contemporary art that does not practice the traditional skills of painting and sculpture.

== Performing arts ==
=== Music ===
Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the &quot;color&quot; of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. 

Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. 

The word derives from Greek μουσική (&quot;mousike&quot;, &quot;art of the Muses&quot;).
=== Dance ===

Dance is an art form that generally refers to movement of the body, usually rhythmic, and to music, used as a form of expression, social interaction or presented in a spiritual or performance setting.
Dance is also used to describe methods of nonverbal communication (see body language) between humans or animals (bee dance, patterns of behaviour such as a mating dance), motion in inanimate objects (&quot;the leaves danced in the wind&quot;), and certain musical genres. In sports, gymnastics, figure skating and synchronized swimming are dance disciplines while the &quot;kata&quot; of the martial arts are often compared to dances.

=== Theatre ===
Modern Western theatre is dominated by realism, including drama and comedy. Another popular Western form is musical theatre. Classical forms of theatre, including Greek and Roman drama, classic English drama (Shakespeare and Marlowe included), and French theater (Molière included), are still performed today. In addition, performances of classic Eastern forms such as Noh and Kabuki can be found in the West, although with less frequency.

=== Film ===
&quot;Fine arts film&quot; is a term that encompasses motion pictures and the field of film as a fine art form. A &quot;fine arts movie theater&quot; is a venue, usually a building, for viewing such movies. Films are produced by recording images from the world with cameras, or by creating images using animation techniques or special effects. Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures, which reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of popular entertainment and a powerful method for educating – or indoctrinating – citizens. The visual elements of cinema give motion pictures a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using dubbing or subtitles that translate the dialogue.

Cinematography is the discipline of making lighting and camera choices when recording photographic images for the cinema. It is closely related to the art of still photography, though many additional issues arise when both the camera and elements of the scene may be in motion.

Independent filmmaking often takes place outside of Hollywood, or other major studio systems. An independent film (or &quot;indie film)&quot; is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a major movie studio. Creative, business, and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st century.

== Poetry ==
Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term ποίησις (&quot;poiesis&quot;, &quot;to make&quot;) is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as sound symbolism, phonaesthetics and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.

== Other ==
* Avant-garde music is frequently considered both a performing art and a fine art.
* Electronic media – perhaps the newest medium for fine art, since it utilizes modern technologies such as computers from production to presentation. Includes, amongst others, video, digital photography, digital printmaking and interactive pieces.
* Textiles, including quilt art and &quot;wearable&quot; or &quot;pre-wearable&quot; creations, frequently reach the category of fine art objects, sometimes like part of an art display.
* Western art (or Classical) music is a performing art frequently considered to be fine art.
* Origami – The last century has witnessed a renewed interest in understanding the behavior of folding matter with contributions from artists and scientists. Origami is different from other arts: while painting requires the addition of matter, and sculpture involves subtraction, origami does not add or subtract: it transforms. Origami artists are pushing the limits of an art increasingly committed to its time, with a bloodline ending in technology and spacecraft. Its computational aspect and shareable quality (empowered by social networks) are parts of the puzzle that is making origami a paradigmatic art of the 21st century.

<text>&#x27; () (&quot;Two-God&quot;) is a name used to refer to the pair of Aztec deities &#x27; and , also known as and . translates as &quot;two&quot; or &quot;dual&quot; in Nahuatl and translates as &quot;Divinity&quot;.Ometeotl was one as the first divinity, and Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl when the being became two to be able to reproduce all creation.

==Definition==
Multiple Nahuatl sources, notably the &quot;Florentine Codex&quot;, name the highest level of heaven or &quot;place of duality&quot; ( specifically terms it &quot;in in &quot; or &quot;the place of duality, above the nine-tiered heavens).&quot; In the , Franciscan priest translated a Nahuatl source reporting that in this layer of heaven there existed &quot;a god named , which means two-gods, and one of them was a goddess.&quot; The &quot;History of the Mexicans as Told by Their Paintings&quot; () names the inhabitants of the uppermost heaven and (Lord and Lady of Abundance). concurs that these are epithets of &quot;in in &quot;, giving as another name of &quot;in &quot; (&quot;the mansion of the Lord of Abundance&quot;).

There is some evidence that these two gods were considered aspects of a single being, as when a singer in the asks where he can go given that &quot; &quot; (&quot;they, God, stand double&quot;). The reports of the two that &quot;&quot; (&quot;they were raised and had always been in the thirteenth heaven; nothing was ever known of their beginning, just their dwelling and creation, which were in the thirteenth heaven&quot;).

As a result of these references, many scholars (most notably ) interpret the rare name as &quot;Dual God&quot; or &quot;Lord of the Duality&quot;. further argues that was the supreme creator deity of the Aztecs, and that the Aztecs envisioned this deity as a mystical entity with a dual nature.

==Critique==
Other scholars however, notably Richard Haly (1992), argue that there was no , or among the Aztecs. Instead, he claims, the names should be interpreted using the Nahuatl root (&quot;bone&quot;), rather than (&quot;two&quot;). Haly further contends that was another name for and , both gods related to the creation of humans from dead bones. He argues that, of the five sources used by to argue in favor of the existence of a single creator god among the Aztecs, none contains a clear reference to a god of duality.

First, cites the Franciscan , who affirms in his chronicle that the &quot;Indians wanted the divine Nature shared by two gods&quot;. In his translation of the introduces a reference to the &quot;God of duality&quot; where it is not explicitly found in the original text, which reads &quot;&quot;. Haly argues that erroneously unites &quot;stands dual&quot; with the Spanish loanword (&quot;God&quot;) to invent this dual deity. Another example given by is from the : &quot;&quot;, literally &quot;two-god, creator of humanity.&quot; Haly, reading the interjection as part of a longer (and similarly unattested) , argues that this should rather be translated as &quot;juicy maguey God&quot; as the text talks about the imbibing of pulque. The has a representation of a god labelled  — iconographic analysis shows the deity to be identical to . The fifth source is the &quot;History of the Mexicans as Told by Their Paintings&quot; which Haly shows does not in fact read , but rather &quot;, (&quot;bone-lord&quot;) who is also called &quot; and is explicitly stated to be identical to .

James Maffie in his book &quot;Aztec Philosophy&quot; poses the argument that Aztec religion was pantheistic, centered on the entity Teotl. As a result of the pantheism proposed by Maffie that he claims was practiced by the Aztecs, it is by definition not possible that Ometeotl can be a “God of Duality” that is separate from Teotl, which is contradictory to the way in which Leon-Portilla talks about Ometeotl as a transcendental creator god.

<text>Opochtli () was one of the gods of the Aztec pantheon. He was considered the god of fishing and hunting, and commonly seen riding a dolphin as well as one of the representatives of the rain god Tlaloc. In Nahuatl, his name means &quot;The Left&quot; or &quot;The Left-Handed&quot;. He was the god who threw his spear with his left hand. Since the Aztecs saw the west as the primary cardinal point, the south was on the left according to their orientation. Opochtli was therefore also associated with the south. He is said to have invented the atlatl, the , the canoe pole, and the bird .

<text>Tlālōcān (; &quot;place of Tlāloc&quot;) is described in several Aztec codices as a paradise, ruled over by the rain deity Tlāloc and his consort Chalchiuhtlicue. It absorbed those who died through drowning or lightning, or as a consequence of diseases associated with the rain deity. Tlālōcān has also been recognized in certain wall paintings of the much earlier Teotihuacan culture. Among modern Nahua-speaking peoples of the Gulf Coast, Tlālōcān survives as an all-encompassing concept embracing the subterranean world and its denizens.

==Aztecs==
In the Florentine Codex, a set of eighteenth-century volumes which form one of the prime sources of information about the beliefs and history of Postclassic central Mexico, Tlālōcān is depicted as a realm of unending Springtime, with an abundance of green foliage and edible plants of the region.

Tlālōcān is also the first level of the upper worlds, or the Aztecs&#x27; Thirteen Heavens, that has four compartments according to the mythic cosmographies of the Nahuatl-speaking peoples of pre-Columbian central Mexico, noted particularly in Conquest-era accounts of Aztec mythology. To the Aztec there were thirteen levels of the Upper Worlds, and nine of the Underworld; in the conception of the Afterlife the manner of a person&#x27;s death determined which of these layers would be their destination after dying. As the place of Tlālōc, 9th Lord of the Night, Tlālōcān was also reckoned as the 9th level of the Underworld, which in the interpretation by Eduard Seler was the uppermost underworld in the east.

As a destination in the Afterlife, the levels of heaven were reserved mostly for those who had died violent deaths, and Tlālōcān was reserved for those who had drowned or had otherwise been killed by manifestations of water, such as by flood, by diseases associated with water, or in storms by strikes of lightning. It was also the destination after death for others considered to be in Tlālōc&#x27;s charge, most notably the physically deformed.

Many different gods are said to inhabit this location, them being: Meztli, moon goddess (Moon), Tlazolteotl, goddess of lust and illicit affairs, patron of sexual incontinence, adultery, sex, passions, carnality and moral transgression, Tiacapan, one of the goddesses of sex, Ixcuina, one of the goddesses of sex, Tecotzin or Teicu, one of the goddesses of sex, Tlaloc, god of thunder, rain and the earth. In this layer he pierces the &quot;clouds&#x27; bellies&quot; to make them rain, Ehecatl, god of the wind. In this layer he blows the clouds with his breath (breezes) to make them move, The Ehecatotontli, gods of the breezes, Mictlanpachecatl, god of the north wind, Cihuatecayotl, god of the west wind, Tlalocayotl, god of the east wind, Huitztlampaehecatl, god of the south wind.

==Contemporary Nahuas==
In areas of contemporary Mexico, such as in the Sierra Norte de Puebla region, some communities continue to incorporate the concept of Tlālōcān as a netherworld and shamanic destination in their modern religious practices. As described by Knab, shamanic entry into Tlālōcān, always achieved during dreams and often with the objective of curing a patient, is via underground waterways, commonly a whirlpool (&quot;the water was whirling there and it took me in and down into the darkness around and around&quot;). Upon awakening, the shaman-dreamer will recount, to the audience during a curing-session, the itinerary traveled in Tlālōcān; to which will be added (only when instructing a trainee or in speaking to other practicing shamans, never to an audience of general public) a description of the itinerary in term of numerically counted rivers, highways, and hills : as counted in series of 14, &quot;There are thus thirteen of each type of feature located between the center and the edges of the underworld and one of each type (p. 120) of feature located in the center of the underworld.&quot;

Here is a description of the sections of Tlālōcān, as arranged in cardinal directions :-
*In the North &quot;are the , the lord of the winds, and the , the lord of death. They are the ones that care for souls for the first year after death. Both of the lords live in great caves. ... there are two caves, one on top of the other, and ... death lives in the lowest realm. The dead enter the underworld from the cemetery, where the lord death and his minions keep their souls. The role of the lord of the winds is to seek out more souls on the surface of the earth with which to populate the regions of the dead.&quot;
*&quot;From the cave of the winds in the northern reaches of t[l]alocan issue the or evil winds, the feared , the or shadow of death, the , and the , the , &#x27;the winds of death&#x27;.&quot; &quot;The cave of the winds ... is where the lord of the winds resides with his various assistants who guard the cooking pots [&quot;According to numerous tales, the assistants are toads who keep the pots.&quot; (p. 163, n. 4:9)] where the ingredients for storms are kept, the winds, mists, rains, thunder, and lightning. Other assistants of the lord of winds are the or lightning bolts, the thunderclaps or , and the smoke ones, who make the or smoke of death that issues forth onto the surface of the earth, in , along with the winds of death.&quot;
*In the South &quot;is a spring of boiling water shrouded in mist and clouds. This spring is found in the depths of a cave illuminated by the fires of the . In the depths of this boiling spring, ... lives ... a giant worm, the . The eats the earth and fashions the caverns ... Its fiery breath and boiling saliva eat away the earth as it crawls beneath the surface.&quot;
*In the East &quot;is the place known as , the waters ... . is a great lake or sea in the underworld that is united in its depths with all the waters of the surface of the world. In its depths live and , the lord and lady of the waters. The is often identified with the or weeping woman {&quot;in the Telleriano-Remensis and the Tonalamatl Aubin, her eyes are filled with tears&quot;} of folklore, who ... is always found near sources of water weeping”. ... In the depths of are cities ..., and ... souls – once they have passed out of the north at the end of the first year of death – seek out ... this region.&quot;
*In the West &quot;is actually a cave inhabited only by truly dangerous women such as , &#x27;death woman,&#x27; and the , &#x27;wind woman&#x27;.&quot; &quot;the women from this side of the underworld ... went in search of the souls of men, especially lascivious men who couple with various women. They would also take the souls of women waiting on the paths, in the gardens, or in the fields for their illicit lovers.&quot;

<text>In Aztec mythology, Tepēyōllōtl (; &quot;heart of the mountains&quot;; also Tepeyollotli) was the god of darkened caves, earthquakes, echoes and jaguars. He is the god of the Eighth Hour of the Night, and is depicted as a jaguar leaping towards the Sun. In the calendar, Tepeyollotl rules over both the third day, Calli (house), and the third trecena, 1-Mazatl (deer).

The word is derived as a compound of the Nahuatl words &#x27; (&quot;mountain&quot;), and&#x27; (&quot;heart&quot; or &quot;interior&quot;). Tepeyollotl is usually depicted as cross-eyed holding the typical white staff with green feathers. Sometimes Tezcatlipoca wore Tepeyollotl for an animal skin or disguise to trick other gods into not knowing who he was.

<text>Tlaltecuhtli (Classical Nahuatl &quot;Tlāltēuctli&quot;, ) is a pre-Columbian Mesoamerican deity worshipped primarily by the Mexica (Aztec) people. Sometimes referred to as the &quot;earth monster,&quot; Tlaltecuhtli&#x27;s dismembered body was the basis for the world in the Aztec creation story of the fifth and final cosmos. In carvings, Tlaltecuhtli is often depicted as an anthropomorphic being with splayed arms and legs. Considered the source of all living things, she had to be kept sated by human sacrifices which would ensure the continued order of the world.

According to a source, in the creation of the Earth, the gods did not tire of admiring the liquid world, no oscillations, no movements, so Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl thought that the newly created world should be inhabited. And for this, they made Tlalcihuatl, &#x27;Lady of the earth&#x27;, come down from heaven, and Tlaltecuhtli, &#x27;Lord of the earth&#x27;, would be her consort. Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl create the Earth from the body of Cipactli, a giant alligator/crocodile self-created in the Omeyocan.

Tlaltecuhtli is known from several post-conquest manuscripts that surveyed Mexica mythology and belief systems, such as the &quot;Histoyre du méchique&quot;, Florentine Codex, and Codex Bodley, both compiled in the sixteenth century.

== Representations in art ==

Tlaltecuhtli is typically depicted as a squatting toad-like creature with massive claws, a gaping mouth, and crocodile skin, which represented the surface of the earth. In carvings, her mouth is often shown with a river of blood flowing from it or a flint knife between her teeth, a reference to the human blood she thirsted for. Her elbows and knees are often adorned with human skulls, and she sometimes appears with multiple mouths full of sharp teeth all over her body. In some images, she wears a skirt made of human bones and a star border, a symbol of her primordial sacrifice.

Many sculptures of Tlaltecuhtli were meant only for the gods and were not intended to be seen by humans. She was often carved onto the bottom of sculptures where they made contact with the earth, or on the undersides of stone boxes called &quot;cuauhxicalli&quot; (&quot;eagle box&quot;), which held the sacrificial hearts she was so partial to. In reference to her mythological function as the support of the earth, Tlaltecuhtli was sometimes carved onto the cornerstones of temples, such as the pyramid platform at El Tajin.

Tlaltecuhtli&#x27;s importance in the Mexica pantheon is demonstrated by her inclusion in major works of art. A representation of the goddess can be found on each side of the 1503 CE Coronation Stone of the Aztec ruler Moctezuma II, alongside the glyphs for fire and water — traditional symbols of war. Historian Mary Miller even suggests that Tlaltecuhtli may be the face in the center of the famous Aztec Calendar Stone (Piedra del Sol), where she symbolizes the end of the 5th and final Aztec cosmos.

Tlaltecuhtli appears in the Aztec calendar as the 2nd of the 13 deity days, and her date glyph is 1 Rabbit.

== Creation narrative ==
According to Alfonso Caso, there were four earth gods — Tlaltecuhtli, Coatlicue, Cihuacoatl and Tlazolteotl.

In the Mexica creation story, Tlaltecuhtli is described as a sea monster (sometimes called Cipactli) who dwelled in the ocean after the fourth Great Flood. She was an embodiment of the chaos that raged before creation. One day, the gods Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca descended from the heavens in the form of serpents and found the monstrous Tlaltecuhtli (Cipactli) sitting on top of the ocean with giant fangs, crocodile skin, and gnashing teeth calling for flesh to feast on. The two gods decided that the fifth cosmos could not prosper with such a horrible creature roaming the world, and so they set out to destroy her. To attract her, Tezcatlipoca used his foot as bait, and Tlaltecuhtli ate it. In the fight that followed, Tezcatlipoca lost his foot and Tlaltecuhtli lost her lower jaw, taking away her ability to sink below the surface of the water. After a long struggle, Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl managed to rip her body in two — from the upper half came the sky, and from the lower came the earth. She remained alive, however, and demanded human blood as repayment for her sacrifice.

The other gods were angered to hear of Tlaltecuhtli&#x27;s treatment and decreed that the various parts of her dismembered body would become the features of the new world. Her skin became grasses and small flowers, her hair the trees and herbs, her eyes the springs and wells, her nose the hills and valleys, her shoulders the mountains, and her mouth the caves and rivers.

According to a source, all the deities of the earth are female, except the advocation of Tezcatlipoca, which is Tepeyollotl, &#x27;heart of the hill&#x27;, and Tlaltecuthli, &#x27;lord earth&#x27;, which the latter is formed by the center of the body of Cipactli, which is It owes its other name, Tlalticpaque, &#x27;lord of the world&#x27;. Tlaltecuhtli meets Coatlicue as a consort as the devourer, and Coatlicue as the one who gives continuous birth to new beings, men and animals.

Since Tlaltecuhtli&#x27;s body was transformed into the geographical features, the Mexica attributed strange sounds from the earth as either the screams of Tlaltecuhtli in her dismembered agony, or her calls for human blood to feed her. As a source of life, it was thought necessary to appease Tlaltecuhtli with blood sacrifices, especially human hearts. The Aztecs believed that Tlaltecuhtli&#x27;s insatiable appetite had to be satisfied or the goddess would cease her nourishment of the earth and crops would fail.

The Mexica believe Tlaltecuhtli to swallow the sun between her massive jaws at dusk, and regurgitate it the next morning at dawn. The fear that this cycle could be interrupted, like during solar eclipses, was often the cause of uneasiness and increased ritual sacrifice. Tlaltecuhtli&#x27;s connection to the sun ensured that she was included in the prayers offered to Tezcatlipoca before Aztec military campaigns.

Finally, because of Tlaltecuhtli&#x27;s association with fertility, midwives called on her aid during difficult births—when an &quot;infant warrior&quot; threatened to kill the mother during labor.

== Gender debate ==

One of the largest modern debates surrounding Tlaltecuhtli is over the deity&#x27;s gender. In English, &quot;tlal-&quot; translates to &quot;earth,&quot; and &quot;tecuhtli&quot; is usually rendered &quot;lord.&quot; However, &quot;teuctli&quot; (like most words in Nahuatl) has no gender, despite normally being used to describe men or male gods. There are notable exceptions—for example, the goddesses Ilamatecuhtli and Chalmecatecuhtli. In the Huehuetlahtolli collected by Horacio Carochi in the early 17th century (known as &quot;The Bancroft Dialogues&quot;), it is clear that &quot;tēuctli&quot; does not mean &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;señor.&quot; Those are just approximations to the genderless Nahuatl title. A better rendering is &quot;esteemed personage&quot; or &quot;noble.&quot; In fact, in &quot;The Bancroft Dialogues,&quot; older women are addressed as &quot;notēcuiyo&quot; or &quot;my noble&quot; several times. 

While Tlaltecuhtli&#x27;s name may be interpreted as masculine, the deity is most often depicted with female characteristics and clothing. According to Miller, &quot;Tlaltecuhtli literally means &#x27;Earth Lord,&#x27; but most Aztec representations clearly depict this creature as female, and despite the expected male gender of the name, some sources call Tlaltecuhtli a goddess. [She is] usually in a &quot;hocker&quot;, or birth-giving squat, with head flung backwards and her mouth of flint blades open.&quot;

Other scholars, like Alfonso Caso, interpret this pose as a male Tlaltecuhtli crouching under the earth with his mouth wide open, waiting to devour the dead. While Tlaltecuhtli is usually portrayed as female, some depictions are clearly male (though these distinctions may at times arise from the Spanish-language gendering process). H.B. Nicholson writes, &quot;most of the available evidence suggests that... the earth monster in the &quot;mamazouhticac&quot; position was conceived to be female and depicted wearing the costume proper to that sex. A male aspect of that deity was also recognized and occasionally represented in appropriate garb—but was apparently quite subordinate to the more fundamental and pervasive female conception.&quot;

This ambiguity has prompted some scholars to argue that Tlaltecuhtli may have possessed a dual gender like several other Mesoamerican primordial deities. In Bernardino Sahagún&#x27;s Florentine Codex, for example, Tlaltecuhtli is invoked as &quot;in tonan in tota&quot; —&quot;our mother, our father&quot;—and the deity is described as both a god and a goddess. Rather than signal hermaphroditism or androgyny, archaeologist Leonardo Lopez Lujan suggests that these varying embodiments are a testament to the deity&#x27;s importance in the Mexica pantheon.

== Monolith ==

In 2006, a massive monolith of Tlaltecuhtli was discovered in an excavation at the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan (modern-day Mexico City). The sculpture measures approximately 13.1 x 11.8 feet (4 x 3.6 meters) and weighs nearly 12 tons, making it one of the largest Aztec monoliths ever discovered—larger even than the Calendar Stone. The sculpture, carved in a block of pink andesite, presents the goddess in her typical squatting position and is vividly painted in red, white, black, and blue. The stone was found by archaeologists broken into 4 pieces. Reassembled, Tlaltecuhtli&#x27;s skull and bones skirt, and the river of blood flowing from her mouth, can be seen.

Though most renderings of Tlaltecuhtli were placed face down, this monolith was found face up. Clutched in her lower right claw is the year glyph for 10 rabbit (1502 CE). Lopez Lujan noted that according to the surviving codices, 1502 was the year that one of the empire&#x27;s most feared rulers, Ahuitzotl, was laid to rest. Just below this monument, Offering 126 was found, a huge dedicatory deposit containing 12 thousand objects.

After several years of excavation and restoration, the monolith can be seen on display at the Museum of the Templo Mayor in Mexico City.

<text>Tlillan-Tlapallan &#x27;Place of the black and red colour&#x27; is a legendary place or region on the Gulf Coast of Mexico where king Quetzalcoatl went on his flight from Tollan in order to burn himself and change into the Morning Star.

The tale can be found in an important 16th-century manuscript (the Codex Chimalpopoca) containing the Annals of Quauhtitlan. Written in Nahua, the text basically translates a pre-Spanish book. The tale also occurs in Bernardino de Sahagún&#x27;s &quot;General History of the Things of New Spain&quot;.

<text>In Aztec mythology, Tloquenahuaque, Tloque Nahuaque () or Tloque Naoaque (&quot;Lord of the Near and the Nigh&quot;) was one of the epithets of Tezcatlipoca. Miguel Leon Portilla argues that Tloque Nahuaque was also used as an epithet of Ometeotl, the hypothetical duality creator God of the Aztecs. Tloquenahuaque, also referred to as Tloque Nahuaque or Tloque Naoaque, is a creator god in Aztec mythology. Meso-Americans knew this god by other names as well, &quot;Moyocoyani or Hunab Ku&quot;.

Alonso de Molina&#x27;s Nahuatl-Spanish dictionary, published in 1571, defines &quot;Tloque Nauaque&quot; as, &quot;next to whom is the being of all things, conserving them and sustaining them&quot;. The original Spanish is &quot;cabe quien esta el ser de todas las cosas, conservándolas y sustentándolas&quot;.

<text>In Aztec mythology,  () was a creator and goddess of fertility, worshiped for peopling the earth and making it fruitful. Most Colonial-era manuscripts equate her with . was the consort of . She is also referred to as Ilhuicacihuātl or &quot;Heavenly Lady.&quot;

Tonacacihuatl is depicted in the Codex Telleriano-Remensis.

==Etymology==
The god&#x27;s name is a compound of two Nahuatl words: and . While can be translated &quot;woman&quot; or &quot;lady&quot;, presents several possible interpretations. Some read this root as (without the long &#x27;o&#x27;), consisting of , meaning &quot;human flesh&quot; or &quot;food&quot;, with the possessive prefix (&quot;our&quot;). By this etymology, would mean &quot;Lady of Our Food&quot; or &quot;Lady of Our Flesh&quot;, most commonly rendered &quot;Lady of Our Sustenance.&quot; The word simply means &quot;abundance&quot;, giving the alternate reading &quot;Lady of Abundance.&quot;

==Origin and role==
 was the Central Mexican form of the creator goddess common to Mesoamerican religions. According to the &quot;Codex Ríos&quot;, the &quot;History of the Mexicans as Told by Their Paintings&quot;, the , and the &quot;Florentine Codex&quot;, and her counterpart resided in , the 13th, highest heaven, from which human souls descended to earth. is associated with procreation, appearing in pre-Columbian art near copulating humans. In the &quot;Florentine Codex&quot;, relates that Aztec midwives would tell newborns after bathing them, &quot;You were created in the place of duality, the place above the nine heavens. Your mother and father— and , the heavenly lady—formed you, created you.&quot;

In 1629, also reported the use of the goddess&#x27;s name in ritual planting prayers, in which a seed of corn is entrusted to the earth deity by a shaman who calls the kernel (&quot;my sister, the Lady of Abundance&quot;).

In the &quot;Codex Chimalpopoca&quot;, and are listed as one of several pairs of gods to whom Quetzalcoatl prays.

== Nauhtzonteteo ==
Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl, or Tonacatecuhtli and Tonacacihuatl govern the divine nature divided into two gods (it is convenient to know man and woman; the man, who created and governed everything that is of the masculine gender and the woman everything that belonged to the feminine gender). Omecihuatl, for her part, gave birth to many children on the Thirteen Heavens with Ometecuhtli, and after all these births she had given birth to a flint, which in their language they call tecpatl, from which the other gods were amazed and frightened, their children agreed to throw it out of the heavens to the said flint, and thus they put into action, and that it fell in a certain part of the earth, called Chicomoztoc, which means &#x27;Seven Caves&#x27;, and that then one thousand and six hundred gods and goddesses came out of it, the Nauhtzonteteo that spread over the face of the earth, the sea, the underworld, and the heavens.

<doc id="90337" wikidata="Q2476532" url="?curid=90337" title="Tonantzin">
<text>Tonantzin ( ) is a Nahuatl title composed of &quot;to-&quot; &quot;our&quot; + &quot;nān&quot; &quot;mother&quot; + &quot;-tzin&quot; &quot;(honorific suffix)&quot;. When addressing Tonantzin directly, men use the suffixed vocative form &quot;Tonāntziné&quot; [], and women use the unsuffixed vocative form &quot;Tonāntzín&quot; [].

==Aspects==
Such Goddesses as &quot;Mother Earth&quot;, the &quot;Goddess of Sustenance&quot;, &quot;Honored Grandmother&quot;, &quot;Snake&quot;, &quot;Bringer of Maize&quot; and &quot;Mother of Corn&quot; can all be called Tonantzin, as it is an honorific title comparable to &quot;Our Lady&quot; or &quot;Our Great Mother&quot;. Other indigenous (Nahuatl) names include &quot;Chicōmexōchitl&quot; [] (literally &quot;Seven Flower&quot;) and &quot;Chālchiuhcihuātl&quot; [] (literally &quot;Emerald/Jade Woman&quot;). A &quot;Tonāntzin&quot; was honored during the movable feast of &quot;Xōchilhuitl&quot; [].

Some have claimed that upon the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe in the hill of Tepeyac where Tonantzin&#x27;s temple had been destroyed by the Spanish priests, the natives recognized Our Lady of Guadalupe as Tonantzin Coatlaxopeuh (Meaning &quot;Our Lady&quot; who emerges from the region of light like the Eagle from fire).

==Alleged syncretism==
Mexico City&#x27;s 17th-century Basilica of Guadalupe—built in honor of the Blessed Virgin and perhaps Mexico&#x27;s most important religious building—was constructed at the base of the hill of Tepeyac. 16th century Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún wrote in his Florentine Codex that Indians traveled to Tepeyac to worship Tonantzin. In her book &quot;Goddesses and the Divine Feminine: A Western Religious History&quot;, Rosemary Radford Ruether wrote:

&quot;Sahagún’s protests have been understood in modern times to mean that an Aztec Goddess named Tonantzin had a temple on the hill of Tepeyac, but this has been questioned. Tonantzin was a title for the maternal aspect of any Aztec goddess, not the name of a particular goddess. When it was used as a title for Mary, the maternal aspect of the Aztec Goddess could be read into the Spanish Marian cult by Nahua Christians. This seems to be what happened, rather than the cult of Guadalupe intentionally replacing an earlier temple or cult of an Aztec Mother Goddess at this particular site.” 

It has been asserted that the word &quot;Guadalupe&quot; in this appellation may derive from Coatlaxopeuh, meaning &quot;the one who crushes the serpent&quot;, and perhaps referring to Quetzalcoatl . The name really came about because the Spanish remembered the Virgin of Guadalupe in Extremadura, Spain, and they realized that by giving this apparition the same name as the one from their homeland, the etymological slippage between their term and the Nahuatl term would further contribute toward their project of conquest through cultural colonization. Of note here is the historical fact that La Virgen de Guadalupe is of tremendous significance in Mexico, reflecting a pre-Columbian understanding on the part of colonized people that Guadalupe must be understood in relation to Coatlaxopeuh, despite ongoing effort by colonizing forces to erase this historical context.

In her book, Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, Gloria E. Anzaldúa notes that &quot;lopeuh&quot; is a Nahuatl word meaning &quot;the one who is at one with the beasts&quot;, and &quot;coatl&quot; is the Nahuatl word for serpent. In the story of the virgin&#x27;s apparition to Juan Diego, Guadalupe tells Juan Diego that her name is &quot;María Coatlalopeuh&quot;. Anzaldúa suggests this name equates to &quot;the one who is at one with the beasts&quot;.

==Modern usage==
Tonantzin is sometimes used as a female given name; Native Californian actress Tonantzin Carmelo is an example. Tona, Tonzi, Toni, Nantzin, and Nancy are possible nicknames.

Tonantzín (spelled with an accent on the final syllable) plays an inspirational role in the Sandra Cisneros short story &quot;Little Miracles, Kept Promises&quot;, from her collection &quot;Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories&quot; (1991). The story includes Cisneros&#x27;s portrait of the artist as a young Chicana. 

In the comic series Love and Rockets by Gilbert Hernandez and Jaime Hernandez, Tonantzin is the name of a central character in Gilbert&#x27;s world of Palomar. The character is often linked to the Aztec goddess.

<text>A Tzitzimītl (plural Tzitzimīmeh) is a type of celestial deity associated with stars in Aztec mythology. They were depicted as skeletal female figures wearing skirts often with skull and crossbones designs. In post-conquest descriptions they are often described as &quot;demons&quot; or &quot;devils&quot;, but this does not necessarily reflect their function in the prehispanic belief system of the Aztecs. 
The Tzitzimimeh were female deities and related to fertility. They were associated with the Cihuateteo and other female deities such as Tlaltecuhtli, Cōātlīcue, Citlālicue and Cihuacōātl, and they were worshipped by midwives and parturient women. The leader of the tzitzimimeh was the goddess Itzpapalotl, who was the ruler of Tamoanchan, the paradise where the Tzitzimimeh resided.

The Tzitzimimeh were also associated with the stars and especially the stars that can be seen around the Sun during a solar eclipse. This was interpreted as the Tzitzimimeh attacking the Sun, thus causing the belief that during a solar eclipse, the &quot;tzitzimime&quot; would descend to the earth and possess men. It was said that if the Tzitzimimeh could not start a bow fire in the empty chest cavity of a sacrificed human at the end of a 52-year calendar round, the fifth sun would end and they would descend to devour the last of men. The Tzitzimimeh were also feared during other ominous periods of the Aztec world, such as during the five unlucky days called Nemontemi which marked an unstable period of the xiuhpōhualli (solar year count) and during the New Fire ceremony marking the beginning of a new calendar round; both were periods associated with the fear of change.

The Tzitzimimeh had a double role in Aztec religion: they were protectresses of the feminine and progenitresses of mankind. They were also powerful and dangerous, especially in periods of cosmic instability.

==In popular culture==
*Tzitzimitl was one of 8 monsters from around the globe to appear as antagonists in the &quot;Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!&quot; episode titled &quot;Mysteries On The Disorient Express.&quot;

*Tzitzimitl is depicted as a high-level demon in the roguelike game &quot;Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup&quot;.

*Tzitzimitl is also what the Warlady Skyy Appletini is referred to in the popular webcomic Erfworld.

*In the tabletop RPG Pathfinder, the Tzitzimitl are powerful undead creatures associated with outer space.

*Tzitzimitl are featured on the Cartoon Network series &quot;Victor and Valentino&quot; as recurring antagonists. In the episode &quot;A New Don&quot;, they are depicted as tall black figures with multiple heads, a constellation style texture, and also have the ability to enter a person&#x27;s body and control them with sunlight being their weakness. They reappear in &quot;Starry Night&quot; where they take over the bodies of Vic and Val&#x27;s friends and try to glean information about their grandmother from them. In &quot;Carmelita&quot; it is revealed that they can also take over inanimate objects as one took over a car. They also appear to be in league with the series&#x27; main antagonist Tez. It is revealed in season 3&#x27;s episode &quot;Another Don&quot; that prominent character Isabella has been Tzitzimitl in disguise since the beginning of the series.

*The tzitzimimeh are antagonists in &quot;Onyx Equinox&quot;, though they are associated with Mictecacihuatl. Though mostly highly aggressive and murderous, an allusion to their role in childbirth can be seen when they calm down the still infant goddess.

*Tzitzimilitl are demons that can be summoned by the player in numerous video games of the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; franchise, including &quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse&quot;, &quot;Persona 4&quot; and its upgraded version &quot;Persona 4 Golden&quot;, and the PSP version of &quot;Persona 2: Innocent Sin&quot;. They are depicted in Kazuma Kaneko&#x27;s artwork as red-robed female figures with countless arms sprouting from their skull, their many hands catching stars from the sky, while their bodies end at a distended belly containing the stars they have devoured.

<text>In Aztec mythology, Xipe Totec (; ) or Xipetotec (&quot;Our Lord the Flayed One&quot;) was a life-death-rebirth deity, god of agriculture, vegetation, the east, spring, goldsmiths, silversmiths, liberation, deadly warfare, the seasons, and the earth. The female equivalent of Xipe Totec was the goddess Xilonen-Chicomecoatl.

Xipe Totec connected agricultural renewal with warfare. He flayed himself to give food to humanity, symbolic of the way maize seeds lose their outer layer before germination and of snakes shedding their skin. He is often depicted as being red beneath the flayed skin he wears, likely referencing his own flayed nature. Xipe Totec was believed by the Aztecs to be the god that invented war. His insignia included the pointed cap and rattle staff, which was the war attire for the Mexica emperor. He had a temple called Yopico within the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan. Xipe Totec is associated with pimples, inflammation and eye diseases, and possibly plague. Xipe Totec has a strong relation to diseases such as smallpox, blisters and eye sickness and if someone suffered from these diseases offerings were made to him.

This deity is of uncertain origin. Xipe Totec was widely worshipped in central Mexico at the time of the Spanish Conquest, and was known throughout most of Mesoamerica. Representations of the god have been found as far away as Tazumal in El Salvador. The worship of Xipe Totec was common along the Gulf Coast during the Early Postclassic. The deity probably became an important Aztec god as a result of the Aztec conquest of the Gulf Coast in the middle of the fifteenth century.

In January 2019, Mexican archaeologists from the National Institute of Anthropology and History confirmed that they had discovered the first known surviving temple dedicated to Xipe Totec in the state of Puebla. The temple was found while examining ruins of the Popoluca peoples indigenous to Mexico. The Popolucas built the temple in an area called Ndachjian-Tehuacan between AD 1000 and 1260 prior to Aztec invasion of the area.

==Etymology==
Xipe Totec or Xipetotec (&quot;Our Lord the Flayed One&quot;) was also known by various other names, including Tlatlauhca (), Tlatlauhqui Tezcatlipoca () (&quot;Red Smoking Mirror&quot;) and Yohuallahuan () (&quot;the Night Drinker&quot;), and Yaotzin (&quot;revered enemy&quot;). The Tlaxcaltecs and the Huexotzincas worshipped a version of the deity under the name of Camaxtli, and the god has been identified with Yopi, a Zapotec god represented on Classic Period urns. 

Originally the name of the first son of the creative couple Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl is Tlatlauhca or Tlatlauhaqui Tezcatlipoca, &quot;Smoking red mirror.&quot; Of obscure origin, this god is honored by the Tlaxcalans and Huejocinas with the name of Camaxtli, and apparently a deity of Zapotlan, Xalisco, is widely known in almost all of Mesoamerica with the name of Xipetotec, &#x27;Our Lord Flayed&#x27;. His body is dyed yellow on one side and lined on the other, his face is carved, superficially divided into two parts by a narrow strip that runs from the forehead to the jawbone. His head wears a kind of hood of different colors with tassels that hang down his back. The Tlaxcala myth that refers to Camaxtle, a god identified as Xipe-Totec himself

It&#x27;s difficult to discern if Camaxtle is the same Tlatlauhqui Tezcatlipoca-Xipetotec or Yayauhqui Tezcatlipoca who changes his name to Mixcoatl; or Huitzilopochtli himself as identified by some informants and authors. The truth is that he is related to fire and hunting. After the destruction of the earth by water, came chaos. Everything was desolation. Humanity had died and the heavens were over the Earth. When the gods saw that the heavens had fallen, they resolved to reach the center of the Earth, opening four subterranean paths for this, and to enter these paths to lift them up. To reward such a great action, Tonacacihuatl and Tonacatecuhtli made their children the lords of the heavens and the stars, and the path that Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl traveled was marked by the Milky Way. And this great nebula was also called Mixcoatl or Iztac-Mixcoatl, &#x27;white cloud snake&#x27;

Jerónimo de Mendieta determines that Iztac-Mixcoatl is the personification of the Milky Way, the inhabitant of Chicomoztoc that the Nahuas call ‘White Cloud Serpent’, since such is the shape of the great nebula in the sky. And Ilancueye is nothing more than the personification of the Earth.

==Attributes==

Xipe Totec appears in codices with his right hand upraised and his left hand extending towards the front. Xipe Totec is represented wearing flayed human skin, usually with the flayed skin of the hands falling loose from the wrists. His hands are bent in a position that appears to possibly hold a ceremonial object. His body is often painted yellow on one side and tan on the other. His mouth, lips, neck, hands and legs are sometimes painted red. In some cases, some parts of the human skin covering is painted yellowish-gray. The eyes are not visible, the mouth is open and the ears are perforated. He frequently had vertical stripes running down from his forehead to his chin, running across the eyes. He was sometimes depicted with a yellow shield and carrying a container filled with seeds. One Xipe Totec sculpture was carved from volcanic rock, and portrays a man standing on a small pedestal. The chest has an incision, made in order to extract the heart of the victim before flaying. It is likely that sculptures of Xipe Totec were ritually dressed in the flayed skin of sacrificial victims and wore sandals. In most of Xipe Totec sculptures, artists always make emphasis in his sacrificial and renewal nature by portraying the different layers of skin.

==Symbolism==
Xipe Totec emerging from rotting, flayed skin after twenty days symbolised rebirth and the renewal of the seasons, the casting off of the old and the growth of new vegetation. New vegetation was represented by putting on the new skin of a flayed captive because it symbolized the vegetation the earth puts on when the rain comes. The living god lay concealed underneath the superficial veneer of death, ready to burst forth like a germinating seed. The deity also had a malevolent side as Xipe Totec was said to cause rashes, pimples, inflammations and eye infections.

The flayed skins were believed to have curative properties when touched and mothers took their children to touch such skins in order to relieve their ailments. People wishing to be cured made offerings to him at Yopico.

==Annual festival==
The annual festival of Xipe Totec was celebrated on the spring equinox before the onset of the rainy season; it was known as &quot;Tlacaxipehualiztli&quot; (; lit. &quot;flaying of men&quot;). This festival took place in March at the time of the Spanish Conquest. Forty days before the festival of Xipe Totec, a slave who was captured at war was dressed to represent the living god who was honored during this period. This occurred in every ward of the city, which resulted in multiple slaves being selected. The central ritual act of &quot;Tlacaxipehualiztli&quot; was the gladiatorial sacrifice of war prisoners, which both began and culminated the festival. On the next day of the festival, the game of canes was performed in the manner of two bands. The first band were those who took the part of Xipe Totec and went dressed in the skins of the war prisoners who were killed the previous day, so the fresh blood was still flowing. The opposing band was composed of daring soldiers who were brave and fearless, and who took part in the combat with the others. After the conclusion of this game, those who wore the human skins went around throughout the whole town, entering houses and demanding that those in the houses give them some alms or gifts for the love of Xipe Totec. While in the houses, they sat down on sheaves of leaves and put on necklaces which were made of ears of corn and flowers. They had them put on garlands and give them pulque to drink, which was their wine. Annually, slaves or captives were selected as sacrifices to Xipe Totec. After having the heart cut out, the body was carefully flayed to produce a nearly whole skin which was then worn by the priests for twenty days during the fertility rituals that followed the sacrifice. This act of putting on new skin was a ceremony called &#x27;Neteotquiliztli&#x27; translating to &quot;impersonation of a god&quot;. The skins were often adorned with bright feathers and gold jewellery when worn. During the festival, victorious warriors wearing flayed skins carried out mock skirmishes throughout Tenochtitlan, they passed through the city begging alms and blessed whoever gave them food or other offerings. When the twenty-day festival was over, the flayed skins were removed and stored in special containers with tight-fitting lids designed to stop the stench of putrefaction from escaping. These containers were then stored in a chamber beneath the temple.

The goldsmiths also participated in &quot;Tlacaxipehualizti&quot;. They had a feast called &quot;Yopico&quot; every year in the temple during the month of &quot;Tlacaxipehualizti&quot;. A satrap was adorned in the skin taken from one of the captives in order to appear like Xipe Totec. On the dress, they put a crown made of rich feathers, which was also a wig of false hair. Gold ornaments were put in the nose and nasal septum. Rattles were put in the right hand and a gold shield was put in the left hand, while red sandals were put on their feet decorated with quail-feathers. They also wore skirts made of rich feathers and a wide gold necklace. They were seated and offered Xipe Totec an uncooked tart of ground maize, many ears of corn that had been broken apart in order to get to the seeds, along with fruits and flowers. The deity was honored with a dance and ended in a war exercise.

==Human sacrifice==
Various methods of human sacrifice were used to honour this god. The flayed skins were often taken from sacrificial victims who had their hearts cut out, and some representations of Xipe Totec show a stitched-up wound in the chest.

&quot;Gladiator sacrifice&quot; is the name given to the form of sacrifice in which an especially courageous war captive was given mock weapons, tied to a large circular stone and forced to fight against a fully armed Aztec warrior. As a weapon he was given a &quot;macuahuitl&quot; (a wooden sword with blades formed from obsidian) with the obsidian blades replaced with feathers. A white cord was tied either around his waist or his ankle, binding him to the sacred &quot;temalacatl&quot; stone. At the end of the &quot;Tlacaxipehualiztli&quot; festival, gladiator sacrifice (known as &quot;tlauauaniliztli&quot;) was carried out by five Aztec warriors; two jaguar warriors, two eagle warriors and a fifth, left-handed warrior.

&quot;Arrow sacrifice&quot; was another method used by the worshippers of Xipe Totec. The sacrificial victim was bound spread-eagled to a wooden frame, he was then shot with many arrows so that his blood spilled onto the ground. The spilling of the victim&#x27;s blood to the ground was symbolic of the desired abundant rainfall, with a hopeful result of plentiful crops. After the victim was shot with the arrows, the heart was removed with a stone knife. The flayer then made a laceration from the lower head to the heels and removed the skin in one piece. These ceremonies went on for twenty days; meanwhile the votaries of the god wore the skins.

Another instance of sacrifice was done by a group of metalworkers who were located in the town of Azcapotzalco, who held Xipe Totec in special veneration. Xipe was a patron to all metalworkers (&quot;teocuitlapizque&quot;), but he was particularly associated with the goldsmiths. Among this group, those who stole gold or silver were sacrificed to Xipe Totec. Before this sacrifice, the victims were taken through the streets as a warning to others.

Other forms of sacrifice were sometimes used; at times the victim was cast into a firepit and burned, others had their throats cut.

<text>In Aztec religion, Xiuhcōātl was a mythological serpent, regarded as the spirit form of Xiuhtecuhtli, the Aztec fire deity sometimes represented as an atlatl or a weapon wielded by Huitzilopochtli. Xiuhcoatl is a Classical Nahuatl word that translates as &quot;turquoise serpent&quot; and also carries the symbolic and descriptive translation of &quot;fire serpent&quot;.

Xiuhcoatl was a common subject of Aztec art, including illustrations in Aztec codices, and was used as a back ornament on representations of both Xiuhtecuhtli and Huitzilopochtli. Xiuhcoatl is interpreted as the embodiment of the dry season and was the weapon of the sun. Apparently, the royal diadem (or &quot;xiuhuitzolli&quot;, &quot;pointed turquoise thing&quot;) of the Aztec emperors represented the tail of the Xiuhcoatl, the fire serpent.

==Attributes==

Typically, Xiuhcoatl was depicted with a sharply back-turned snout and a segmented body. Its tail resembled the trapeze-and-ray year sign and probably does represent that symbol. In Nahuatl, the word &quot;xihuitl&quot; means &quot;year&quot;, &quot;turquoise&quot;, and &quot;grass&quot;. Often, the tail of Xiuhcoatl is marked with the Aztec symbol for &quot;grass&quot;. The body of the Xiuhcoatl was wrapped with knotted strips of paper, linking the serpent to bloodletting and sacrifice.

In the Postclassic period, the Xiuhcoatl fire serpent was associated with the three concepts associated with its tail-sign: turquoise, grass, and the solar year. All three of these concepts were associated with fire in central Mexico during the Postclassic, with dry grass and the solar year being closely identified with fire and solar heat. Page 46 of the pre-Columbian Codex Borgia depicts four smoking Xiuhcoatl serpents arranged around a burning turquoise mirror. A turquoise-rimmed mirror has been found at the Maya city of Chichen Itza, with four fire serpents encircling the rim. The archaeological site of Tula has warrior columns on Mound B that bear mirrors on their backs, also surrounded by four Xiuhcoatl fire serpents.

Although the Fire Serpent easily may be traced back to the Early Postclassic period in Tula, its ultimate origins are unclear. During the Classic Period, the War Serpent of Teotihuacan was probably a forerunner of Xiuhcoatl, it was also depicted with the grass symbol, flames, and the trapeze-and-ray year symbol.

==Mythology==

Xiuhcoatl was considered to be the nahual, or spirit form, of the Aztec fire deity Xiuhtecuhtli. It was a lightning-like weapon borne by Huitzilopochtli. With it, soon after his birth, he pierced his sister Coyolxauhqui, destroying her, and also defeated the Centzon Huitznahua. This incident is illustrated on a fragment of broken sculpture excavated from the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan. The fragment was originally a part of a large stone disk that depicted the fallen Coyolxauhqui with the Xiuhcoatl fire serpent penetrating her chest. This Xiuhcoatl wielded by Huitzilopochtli symbolizes the forces of darkness being driven out by the fiery rays of the sun.

Tonatiuh, the sun god, was guided across the sky by Xiuhcoatl and was used by him as a weapon against his underworld enemies, the stars, and the moon.

==Ritual==
During the Panquetzaliztli ceremony, Xiuhcoatl was represented by a paper serpent with red feathers emerging from its open maw to represent flames. During the ceremony, burning torches also symbolized Xiuhcoatl and a serpent dance was performed.

<text>In Aztec mythology, Yacatecuhtli () was a patron god of commerce and travelers, especially business travelers. His symbol is a bundle of sticks. Merchants would carry a cane as they moved from village to village peddling their wares, and at night-time would tie them together into a neat bundle before sprinkling them with blood from their ears. It was believed that this ritual in Yacatecuhtli&#x27;s honor would guarantee success in future business ventures, not to mention protection from vicious beasts and robbers on their journeys.

His name means &quot;lord of the nose&quot; (Nahuatl &quot;yacatl&quot;, nose and &quot;tecuhtli&quot;, lord), or more figuratively “lord of the vanguard,” as a vanguard goes ahead of the main body similar to how a nose is always in front of one’s body.

<text>Phycology () is the scientific study of algae. Also known as algology, phycology is a branch of life science.

Algae are important as primary producers in aquatic ecosystems. Most algae are eukaryotic, photosynthetic organisms that live in a wet environment. They are distinguished from the higher plants by a lack of true roots, stems or leaves. They do not produce flowers. Many species are single-celled and microscopic (including phytoplankton and other microalgae); many others are multicellular to one degree or another, some of these growing to large size (for example, seaweeds such as kelp and &quot;Sargassum&quot;).

A number of microscopic algae also occur as symbionts in lichens.

Phycologists typically focus on either freshwater or ocean algae, and further within those areas, either diatoms or soft algae.

==History of phycology==
While both the ancient Greeks and Romans knew of algae, and the ancient Chinese even cultivated certain varieties as food, the scientific study of algae began in the late 18th century with the description and naming of &quot;Fucus maximus&quot; (now &quot;Ecklonia maxima&quot;) in 1757 by Pehr Osbeck. This was followed by the descriptive work of scholars such as Dawson Turner and Carl Adolph Agardh, but it was not until later in the 19th century that efforts were made by J.V. Lamouroux and William Henry Harvey to create significant groupings within the algae. Harvey has been called &quot;the father of modern phycology&quot; in part for his division of the algae into four major divisions based upon their pigmentation.

It was in the late 19th and early 20th century, that phycology became a recognized field of its own. Men such as Friedrich Traugott Kützing continued the descriptive work. In Japan, beginning in 1889, Kintarô Okamura not only provided detailed descriptions of Japanese coastal algae, he also provided comprehensive analysis of their distribution. Although R. K. Greville published his &quot;Algae Britannicae&quot; as early as 1830, it was not until 1902 with the publication of &quot;A Catalogue of the British Marine Algae&quot; by Edward Arthur Lionel Batters that the systematic correlation of records, extensive distribution mapping and the development of identification keys began in earnest. In 1899–1900, Anna Weber-Van Bosse, a Dutch Phycologist travelled on the Siboga expedition and later in 1904, published &quot;The Corallinaceae of the Siboga-expedition&quot;.

As early as 1803 Jean Pierre Étienne Vaucher had published on the isogamy (sexual conjugation) in the algae, but it was in the early 20th century that reproduction and development began to be extensively studied. The 1935 and 1945 comprehensive volumes of Felix Eugen Fritsch consolidated what was then known about the morphology and reproduction of the algae. This was followed in the 1950s by the development of area checklists, led by Mary Parke with her 1931 &quot;Manx Algae&quot; and followed in 1953 by her &quot;A preliminary check-list of British marine algae&quot; Although Lily Newton&#x27;s 1931 &quot;Handbook&quot; provided the first identification key for the algae of the British Isles, it was the 1960s before the development of such keys became routine. The 1980s with the new emphasis on ecology saw increased study of algal communities, and the place of algae in larger plant communities, and provided an additional tool for explaining geographical variation.

The continent with the richest diversity of seaweeds is Australia, which has 2,000 species.

<text>The Swan River () is a major river in the southwest of Western Australia. The river runs through the metropolitan area of Perth, Western Australia&#x27;s capital and largest city.

==Course of river==
The Swan River estuary flows through the city of Perth. Its lower reaches are relatively wide and deep, with few constrictions, while the upper reaches are usually quite narrow and shallow.

The Swan River drains the Avon and coastal plain catchments, which have a total area of about . It has three major tributaries, the Avon River, Canning River and Helena River. The latter two have dams (Canning Dam and Mundaring Weir) which provide a sizeable part of the potable water requirements for Perth and the surrounding regions. The Avon River contributes the majority of the freshwater flow. The climate of the catchment is Mediterranean, with mild wet winters, hot dry summers, and the associated highly seasonal rainfall and flow regime.

The Avon rises near Yealering, southeast of Perth: it meanders north-northwest to Toodyay about northeast of Perth, then turns southwest in Walyunga National Park – at the confluence of the Wooroloo Brook, it becomes the Swan River.

The Canning River rises from North Bannister, southeast of Perth and joins the Swan at Applecross, opening into Melville Water. The river then narrows into Blackwall Reach, a narrow and deep stretch leading the river through Fremantle Harbour to the sea.

The estuary is subject to a microtidal regime, with a maximum tidal amplitude of about , although water levels are also subject to barometric pressure fluctuations.

==Geology==
Before the Tertiary, when the sea level was much lower than at present, the Swan River curved around to the north of Rottnest Island, and disgorged itself into the Indian Ocean slightly to the north and west of Rottnest. In doing so, it carved a gorge about the size of the Grand Canyon. Now known as Perth Canyon, this feature still exists as a submarine canyon near the edge of the continental shelf.

==Geography==

The Swan River drains the Swan Coastal Plain, a total catchment area of over in area. The river is located in a Mediterranean climate, with hot dry summers and cool wet winters, although this balance appears to be changing due to climate change. The Swan is located on the edge of the Darling Scarp, flowing downhill across the coastal plain to its mouth at Fremantle.

===Sources===
The Swan begins as the Avon River, rising near Yealering in the Darling Range, approximately from its mouth at Fremantle. The Avon flows north, passing through the towns of Brookton, Beverley, York, Northam and Toodyay. It is joined by tributaries including the Dale River, the Mortlock River and the Brockman River. The Avon becomes the Swan as Wooroloo Brook enters the river near Walyunga National Park.

===Tributaries===
More tributaries including Ellen Brook, Jane Brook, Henley Brook, Wandoo Creek, Bennett Brook, Blackadder Creek, Limestone Creek, Susannah Brook, and the Helena River enter the river between Wooroloo Brook and Guildford; however, most of these have either dried up or become seasonally flowing due to human impacts such as land clearing and development.

===Swan coastal plain===

Between Perth and Guildford the river goes through several loops. Originally, areas including the Maylands Peninsula, Ascot and Burswood, through Claise Brook and north of the city to Herdsman Lake were swampy wetlands. Most of the wetlands have since been reclaimed for land development. Heirisson Island, upon which The Causeway passes over, was once a collection of small islets known as the Heirisson Islands.

===Perth Water and Melville Water===
Perth Water, between the city and South Perth, is separated from the main estuary by the Narrows, over which the Narrows Bridge was built in 1959. The river then opens up into the large expanse of the river known as Melville Water. The Canning River enters the river at Canning Bridge in Applecross from its source south-east of Armadale. The river is at its widest here, measuring more than from north to south. Point Walter has a protruding spit that extends up to into the river, forcing river traffic to detour around it.

===Narrowing and Fremantle===

The river narrows between Chidley Point and Blackwall Reach, curving around Point Roe and Preston Point before narrowing into the harbour. Stirling Bridge and the Fremantle Traffic Bridge cross the river north of the rivermouth. The Swan River empties into the Indian Ocean at Fremantle Harbour.

==History==


The river was named &quot;Swarte Swaene-Revier&quot; by Dutch explorer, Willem de Vlamingh in 1697, after the famous black swans of the area. Vlamingh sailed with a small party up the river to around Heirisson Island.

A French expedition under Nicholas Baudin also sailed up the river in 1801.

Governor Stirling&#x27;s intention was that the name &quot;Swan River&quot; refer only to the watercourse upstream of the Heirisson Islands. All of the rest, including Perth Water, he considered estuarine and which he referred to as &quot;Melville Water&quot;. The Government notice dated 27 July 1829 stated &quot;... the first stone will be laid of a new town to be called &#x27;Perth&#x27;, near the entrance to the estuary of the Swan River.&quot;

Almost immediately after the Town of Perth was established, a systematic effort was underway to reshape the river. This was done for many reasons:
* to alleviate flooding in winter periods;
* improve access for boats by having deeper channels and jetties;
* removal of marshy land which created a mosquito menace;
* enlargement of dry land for agriculture and building.

Perth streets were often sandy bogs which caused Governor James Stirling in 1837 to report to the Secretary of State for Colonies:

At the present time it can scarcely be said that any roads exist, although certain lines of communication have been improved by clearing them of timber and by bridging streams and by establishing ferries in the broader parts of the Swan River ...

Parts of the river required dredging with the material dumped onto the mud flats to raise the adjoining land. An exceptionally wet winter in 1862 saw major flooding throughout the area – the effect of which was exacerbated by the extent of the reclaimed lands. The first bucket dredge in Western Australia was the &quot;Black Swan&quot;, used between 1872 and 1911 for dredging channels in the river, as well as reclamation.

===Notable features===
A number of features of the river, particularly around the city, have reshaped its profile since European settlement in 1829:

*Claise Brook – named &quot;Clause&#x27;s Brook&quot; on early maps, after Frederick Clause. This was a fresh water creek which emptied the network of natural lakes north of the city. Before an effective sewerage system was built, it became an open sewer which dumped waste directly into the river for many years during the 1800s and early 1900s. The area surrounding has been mainly industrial for most of the period of European settlement and it has a long history of neglect. Since the late 1980s, the East Perth redevelopment has dramatically tidied up the area and works include a landscaped inlet off the river large enough for boats. The area is now largely residential and the &quot;brook&quot; exists in name only with the lakes having been either removed or managed by artificial drainage systems.
*Point Fraser – early maps showed this as a major promontory on the northern side of the river west of the Causeway. It disappeared between 1921 and 1935 when land fill was added on both sides, straightening the irregular foreshore and forming the rectangular &#x27;The Esplanade&#x27;.
*The Esplanade – the northern riverbank originally ran close to the base of the escarpment generally a single block width south of St Georges Terrace. Houses built on the southern side of St Georges Terrace included market gardens which ran to the waters edge.
*Heirisson Islands – a series of mudflats that were slightly more upstream from today&#x27;s single artificial island which has deep channels on each side.
*Burswood – early in the settlement the Perth flats restricted the passage of all but flat bottom boats travelling between Perth and Guildford. It was decided that a canal be built to bypass these creating Burswood Island. In 1831 it took seven men 107 days to do the work. Once completed, it measured about in length by an average top width of nearly which tapered to at the bottom; the depth varied between nearly . Further improvements were made in 1834. The area on the south side of the river upstream from the causeway was filled throughout the 1900s, reclaiming an area five-times the area of the Mitchell Interchange/Narrows Bridge works.
*Point Belches – later known as Mill Point, South Perth. Originally existed as a sandy promontory surrounding a deep semi-circular bay. This was later named Millers Pool and was eventually filled in and widened to become the present-day South Perth peninsula to which the Narrows Bridge and Kwinana Freeway adjoin.
*Point Lewis (also known as &#x27;One-Tree Point&#x27; after a solitary tree that stood on the site for many years) – the northern side of the Narrows Bridge site, and now beneath the interchange.
*Mounts Bay – a modest reclamation was done between 1921 and 1935. In the 1950s works involving the Narrows Bridge started and in 1957 the bay was dramatically reduced in size with works related to the Mitchell Interchange and the northern approaches to the Narrows. An elderly Bessie Rischbieth famously protested against the project by standing in the shallows in front of the bulldozers for a whole day in 1957. She succeeded in halting progress – for that one day.
*Bazaar Terrace/Bazaar Street – in the early days of the settlement this waterfront road between William Street and Mill Street was an important commercial focus with port facilities including several jetties adjoining. It is now approximately where Mounts Bay Road is today and set well back from the foreshore. It had a prominent limestone wall and promenade built using material quarried from Mount Eliza.
*River mouth at Fremantle – the harbour was built in the 1890s and the limestone reef blocking the river was removed at the same time, after 70 years of demands. The dredging of the area to build the Harbour effectively changed the river dynamics from a winter flushing flow to a tidal flushing estuary. It was also at this time that the Helena River was dammed as part of C. Y. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s ambitious and successful plan to provide water to the Kalgoorlie Goldfields.

===Environmental issues===
The river has been used for the disposal all kinds of waste. Even well into the 1970s, various local councils had rubbish tips on the mud flats along the edge of the river. Heavy industry also contributed its share of waste into the river from wool scouring plants in Fremantle to fertiliser and foundries sited in the Bayswater – Bassendean area. Remedial sites works are still ongoing in these areas to remove the toxins left to leach into the river.

During the summer months there are problems with algal blooms killing fish and caused by nutrient run-off from farming activities as well as the use of fertilisers in the catchment areas. The occasional accidental spillage of sewage and chemicals has also caused sections of the river to be closed to human access. The river has survived all this and is in relatively good condition considering on-going threats to its ecology.

In 2010 the Western Australian government imposed restrictions on phosphorus levels in fertilisers due to concerns about the health of the Swan and Canning river system.

===Flood events===
Data collection of flood events in the estuary has been performed since European arrival in 1829. In July 1830, barely a year after the establishment of the colony, the river rose above its normal level. New settlers were still arriving in steady numbers and few permanent buildings had been constructed, with most living in tents and other temporary accommodation. These included caves along the river&#x27;s edge and many found their belongings washed away and livestock drowned. Other abnormal flooding events occurred in the winters of 1847 and 1860, while the most recent flooding occurred in 2017. Later events have since been assessed for probability of recurrence:

The largest recorded flood event was in July 1872 which had a calculated ARI of 100. This approximately equates to a 100-year flood event. At the Helena River, the 1872 flood level was higher than the 1862 event (ARI=60). An account in &quot;The Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal&quot; on 26 July 1872 reported
In and about Perth, the water owing to the force of the incoming seas at the mouth of the river presented a scene of a great lake, all the jetties were submerged, the high roads to Fremantle covered, and passage traffic rendered impossible quantities of sandalwood lying along the banks of river were washed away, and the inhabitants of the suburban villas on the slopes of Mount Eliza obliged to scramble up the hill sides to get into Perth.

The flood of July 1926 (ARI=30) resulted in the washing away of the Upper Swan Bridge and a section of the Fremantle Railway Bridge. The Fremantle bridge partially collapsed on 22 July 1926, five minutes after a train containing schoolchildren had passed over. No one was injured in the collapse; however, it created major disruption to commerce for several months. Repairs were completed and the bridge reopened on 12 October 1926.
==Governance==
The Swan River Trust was a state government body, within the ambit of the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia) – that was constituted in 1989 after legislation passed the previous year, that reports to the Minister for the Environment. It brings together eight representatives from the community, State and local government authorities with an interest in the Swan and Canning rivers to form a single body responsible for planning, protecting and managing Perth&#x27;s river system.

The functions of the Trust have been absorbed by the subsequent Western Australian Environmental protection authorities, the most recent change being in 2017, to the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.

==Human uses==

===Transport===
In the earliest days of the Swan River Settlement, the river was used as the main transport route between Perth and Fremantle. This continued until the establishment of the Government rail system between Fremantle and Guildford via Perth. 
===Bridges===

There are currently 22 road and railway bridges crossing the Swan River. These are (from Fremantle, heading upstream):
* Fremantle Railway Bridge, North Fremantle to Fremantle (Fremantle line)
* Fremantle Traffic Bridge, North Fremantle to Fremantle
* Stirling Bridge (Stirling Highway), North Fremantle to East Fremantle

* Yagan Bridge, Belhus to Upper Swan (Great Northern Highway; formerly called the Upper Swan Bridge)
* Upper Swan railway bridge, Upper Swan (unnamed)
* Bells Rapids bridge, Upper Swan to Brigadoon (unnamed)

===Rowing clubs===
The earliest club was the West Australian Rowing Club. The Swan River Rowing Club started in 1887. The Fremantle Rowing Club had started by the 1890s.

===Yacht clubs===

There are currently fifteen yacht clubs along the Swan River, with most on Melville Water, Freshwater Bay and Matilda Bay. Royal Perth Yacht Club, on Pelican Point in Matilda Bay, staged the unsuccessful 1987 America&#x27;s Cup defence, the first time in 132 years it had been held outside of the United States. Royal Perth Yacht Club and the Royal Freshwater Bay Yacht Club are the only two clubs to be granted a royal charter. There are also many anchorages and marinas along the lower reaches near Fremantle.

==Cultural significance==
The river is a significant part of Perth culture, with many water sports such as rowing, sailing, and swimming all occurring in its waters.

There have been some &quot;north of the river&quot; or &quot;south of the river&quot; distinctions in the Perth metropolitan region over time, especially in the time up to the completion of the Causeway and Narrows bridges, due to the time and distances to cross the river.

The river was the site of the City of Perth Skyworks, a fireworks show held each year on Australia Day from 1985 until 2022, with spectators crowding the foreshore, Kings Park, and on boats on the river to watch the event.

=== Aboriginal ===
The Noongar people believe that the Darling Scarp represents the body of a Wagyl (also spelt Waugal) – a snakelike being from Dreamtime that meandered over the land creating rivers, waterways and lakes. It is thought that the Wagyl/Waugal created the Swan River.

<text>A code duello is a set of rules for a one-on-one combat, or duel. Codes duello regulate dueling and thus help prevent vendettas between families and other social factions. They ensure that non-violent means of reaching agreement are exhausted and that harm is reduced, both by limiting the terms of engagement and by providing medical care. Finally, they ensure that the proceedings have a number of witnesses. The witnesses could assure grieving members of factions of the fairness of the duel, and could help provide testimony if legal authorities become involved.

==From the Roman Empire to Middle Ages==
In Rome, the most famous duel was fought between three Horatii brothers and three Curiatii brothers, respecting precise rules during the 7th century BC. Marc Antony and Octavian also challenged each other to a duel which never came to fruition. The Lombards had dueling rituals too, often controlled by local judges. The Norse sagas give accounts of the rules of dueling in the Viking Age holmganga. The 1409 AD &#x27;Flos Duellatorum&#x27; of Italy is the earliest example of an actual code duello in Europe. Fechtbücher of Hans Talhoffer and other fifteenth century masters give rules for judicial duels and &quot;tournament rules&quot;, with varying degrees of detail.

==From the Renaissance to the 19th century==
A morally acceptable duel would start with the challenger issuing a traditional, public, personal grievance, based on an insult, directly to the single person who offended the challenger.

The challenged person had the choice of a public apology or other restitution, or choosing the weapons for the duel. The challenger would then propose a place for the &quot;field of honor&quot;. The challenged person had to either accept the site or propose an alternative. The location had to be a place where the opponents could duel without being arrested. It was common for the constables to set aside such places and times and spread the information, so that bystanders could avoid the location and stay out of harm&#x27;s way. 

At the field of honor, each side would bring a doctor and seconds. The seconds would try to reconcile the parties by acting as go-betweens to attempt to settle the dispute with an apology or restitution. If reconciliation succeeded, all parties considered the dispute to be honorably settled, and went home.

Each side would have at least one second; three was the traditional number.

If one party failed to appear, he was considered to be a coward and the appearing party would win by default. The seconds (and sometimes the doctor) would bear witness to the cowardice. The resulting reputation for cowardice would often considerably affect the individual&#x27;s standing in society, perhaps even extending to his family also.

The sword, with or without a companion weapon, was the customary dueling weapon until around 1800, by which time the custom of wearing the sword in civilian life had largely died out and the pistol had taken its pride of place in both dueling and self-defense. Nevertheless, sword duels continued until the extinction of dueling itself.

When using swords, the two parties would start on opposite sides of a square twenty paces wide. Usually, the square was marked at the corners with dropped handkerchiefs. Leaving the square was accounted cowardice.

The opponents agreed to duel to an agreed condition. While many modern accounts dwell heavily on &quot;first blood&quot; as the condition, manuals of honour from the day universally deride the practice as dishonorable and unmanly. Far more common was a duel until either one party was physically unable to fight or the physician called a halt. While explicit or sustained duels &quot;to the death&quot; were rare, many duels nonetheless resulted in the death of one or both combatants, because of the wounds sustained and the limited capacities of doctors of the time to treat such wounds effectively; it was not uncommon for wounded participants to succumb to infection, later.

When the condition was achieved, the matter was considered settled with the winner proving their point and the loser keeping their reputation for courage.

==Irish Code Duello==

Dueling with firearms grew in popularity in the 18th century, especially with the adoption of the Irish Code Duello in 1777 at the Clonmel Summer Assizes. The Code consists of 25 rules and several footnotes. Rule #16 gives the choice of weapons to the challenged party, but the use of swords can be avoided if the challenger swears on his honor not to be a swordsman, making it easier and more practical to duel.

Typical weapons were cased dueling pistols, tuned for identical appearance, reliability and accuracy. In America, the Irish code eventually supplanted the usual method of brutal hand-to-hand combat and gave the combat a respectable feel. However, since the combatants could not control guns as precisely as swords, gun duels had a greater chance of being fatal. Some duels miscarried because both opponents did not hear or see the starting signal. Agreeing to a signal was helpful.

The Irish code banned the custom of deloping or deliberately discharging one&#x27;s firearm into the ground (usually, well away from the opponent). This custom was used when one or both duelists wished to end a dispute without inflicting bodily harm or appearing cowardly; the Irish code forbade the practice because it often resulted in accidental injury.

In 1838, former governor of South Carolina John Lyde Wilson published &quot;The Code of Honor; or Rules for the Government of Principals and Seconds in Dueling&quot;. The author later stated that at the time of writing, he had never seen the Irish code.

==Marquess of Queensberry==

Just a few years after it was promulgated, many people wrote rather forcefully that the Irish Code was far too deadly for the necessary business of discovering social positions among the military gentry. Those objecting to the &#x27;Code Duello&#x27; included Benjamin Franklin and Queen Victoria, in whose day and realm the duel was already nearly extinct.

Pugilism had been growing in popularity and technique in Venice since 12th century, and in England since 1615, when a London armsmaster began offering public lessons in fisticuffs to the gentry. After many years, and several attempts by other men to write acceptable rules, John Graham Chambers wrote the &quot;Marquess of Queensberry rules&quot; in 1865. They were published in 1867.

He intended them solely for &quot;amateur matches,&quot; a thinly veiled reference to bouts of fisticuffs between gentlemen. The authorities began to allow prize matches and amateur boxing under this new rule system when John Sholto Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry, endorsed its use.

The new rules had a three-minute limit on rounds, required gloves, and forbade grappling and wrestling. The rules prevented permanent mutilation: They did not permit punches to the temples, neck or below the belt. They also forbade kicking, biting and eye gouging.

The result was a viscerally satisfying fight with far less actual hazard than either a sword or gunfight. In other words, it became a nearly perfect vehicle for addressing matters of pride and insult.

As a practical matter, the legal sport of pugilism replaced dueling for most English gentlemen near this time. Only the involved gentlemen ever needed to know the points of honor at stake.

Dueling thereby moved underground and to &#x27;sport&#x27; and has stayed there.

==Southern U.S. code of honor==

Southern duels persisted through the 1840s even after dueling in the United States was outlawed. Commonly held on sand bars in rivers where jurisdiction was unclear, they were rarely prosecuted. States such as South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Louisiana and others had their own dueling customs and traditions. Most duels occurred between adult members of the upper classes, but teenage duels and those in the middle-classes also existed. Duels offered the promise of esteem and status, and they also served as a form of scapegoating for unresolved personal problems.

===Western U.S. code duello===
The stereotypical quick draw duel seen in many Western films were, in part, from the traditional code duello of the South brought by Southern emigrants. Duels in the Old West were fought for personal honor, though the quick-draw duels of popular legend were in actuality rare. Typical Western duels were a crude form of Southern code duello; they were highly formalized means of solving disputes between gentlemen, with swords or guns, that had their origins in European chivalry. The first known quick-draw duel was conducted by a Southern man named Davis Tutt against Wild Bill Hickok on July 21, 1865. Other more formal duels, like those typical in Europe, were also fought, like the Anderson–McCluskie duel.

<text>Mario Luis Kreutzberger Blumenfeld (; born 28 December 1940), better known by his stage name as Don Francisco (), is a Chilean television host, and a popular personality on the Univision network reaching Spanish-speaking viewers in the United States. He is best known for hosting the former variety shows &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot;, &quot;Don Francisco Presenta&quot; and Don Francisco Te Invita.

==Biography==
Mario Luis Kreutzberger Blumenfeld was born in Talca, Chile on 28 December 1940, to Anna Blumenfeld Neufeld and Erick Kreutzberger, of German Jewish ancestry who fled to Chile to escape from World War II. He has always been fluent in both Spanish and German; the latter, which was used with his parents at home when he was growing up, was his first language. He is of Jewish faith.

==Career==
Kreutzberger started a TV show in 1962, and he named it &quot;Show Dominical&quot; (&quot;Sunday&#x27;s Show&quot;) on Canal 13; the program&#x27;s broadcasts were subsequently moved to Saturdays, and henceforth, was renamed &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot;. In it, he adapted many of the formulas he had seen in American television to the Chilean public. The show became an instant hit that lasted over 53 years. In 1986, the show began to be produced by SIN in Miami, Florida, with the same formula used in Chile, with the slightly different name of &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot; to KMEX-DT channel 34 Los Angeles.

For the next six years, Kreutzberger developed a three-hour-long variety show, which included contests, comedy, interviews and a &quot;traveling camera&quot; section. The traveling camera, or &quot;Cámara Viajera&quot; (originally &quot;La Película Extranjera&quot;, The Foreign Movie), has taken &quot;Don Francisco&quot; to over 185 countries worldwide, many of them more than once. Kreutzberger in his show has interviewed many celebrities, including Roberto Durán, Cristina Saralegui, Sussan Taunton, Charytín, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Bill Gates and many others. Through a talent partnership with Memo Flores of Jugaremos en Familia, &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot; has helped launch the careers of many famous entertainers, such as Lili Estefan, Sissi Fleitas, and numerous others. Kreutzberger appeared as himself in the movie &quot;The 33&quot;, about the 2010 Copiapó mining accident.

Immediately after the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état the military sought after Kreutzberger. They took him to the vandalized house of Salvador Allende, where corpses of guards were still on the floor. The soldiers asked him to report on the events. Kreutzberger declined the offer, encouraging the captain who had approached him to take the role of reporter himself.

==Television career==
Kreutzberger has also hosted Chilean versions of &quot;¿Quién merece ser millonario?&quot; (which is based on the original British format of the international &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; franchise), &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, and &quot;Atrapa los Millones&quot; (which is based on the American format of the international Money Drop franchise). He hosted the first three seasons of &quot;Atrapa los Millones&quot; before retiring from the program in 2014; Diana Bolocco became the host for the program&#x27;s fourth season in 2015, and would eventually remain with the show until its cancellation.

He voiced Governor Bernardo de Galvez in a 2003 episode, &quot;The Great Galvez&quot;, of a PBS Kids show &quot;Liberty&#x27;s Kids&quot;.

On 18 April 2015, Don Francisco announced his show would come to an end in September after 53 years on air; &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot; aired its final episode called &quot;Hasta Siempre&quot; on 19 September 2015.

On 1 March 2016, Don Francisco announced his return to the television and signed a multi-year deal with Telemundo. His first show on the network titled &quot;Don Francisco Te Invita&quot;, a Sunday night talk show considered to be a spiritual successor to both &quot;Don Francisco Presenta&quot; and &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot;, debuted on 9 October 2016. The Telemundo show was canceled in late 2018 after the airing of 100 episodes.

==False death reports==
On April Fool&#x27;s Day, 2003, a rumor arose that Kreutzberger had died, the rumor appearing around the New York and New Jersey area. The rumor proved false, but distressed many of his fans until it was revealed that it was a joke and Francisco had not actually died.

==Personal life==
Kreutzberger promoted and hosted the Teletón, a TV charity show for disabled Chilean children between 1978 and 2021; there have been 22 telethons over 30 years. He is also the Hispanic spokesperson for the U.S. Muscular Dystrophy Association, in which he also appears in a pre-recorded piece on its annual telethon, to appeal to Hispanics to donate. He retired from hosting the show in 2021, at the end of that year&#x27;s airing of the program.

Kreutzberger was also the first host of the &quot;Teletón USA&quot; telethon, which was introduced in December 2012 on the Univision network; the event and charity is based on the popular Teleton (Chile) the Chilean Teleton.

==Honors==
His show was in world&#x27;s longest running TV variety show, according to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;.

Kreutzberger has received numerous awards and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (on 7018 Hollywood Blvd.).

On 1 March 2012, Kreutzberger was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame.

On 8 September 2015, the city of New York named a street in the Washington Heights district in honor of Kreutzberger, named &quot;Don Francisco Boulevard&quot;.

On 11 April 2018, the Jewish Community of Chile recognized Mario Kreutzberger as &quot;Javer Olam&quot; (friend of the world)

==Celebrity advertising==
Don Francisco has been in commercials for La Curaçao Department Stores. He was even present for the opening of La Curaçao&#x27;s South Gate, California and Arizona locations.

He also appears in TV spots for the Mexican telecom company &quot;Claro&quot;.

In 2010, the U.S. Social Security Administration enlisted Don Francisco to appear in a series of public service announcements to reach out to American Hispanics about the benefits of Social Security.

==Lawsuit==
In 1992, Kreutzberger was sued by one of his models for sexual harassment, but the suit was settled out of court.

<text>The Hastings Embroidery was commissioned by Group Captain Ralph Ward and made by the Royal School of Needlework in 1965 to celebrate the 900th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings the following year.

Intended to be a modern-day equivalent of the Bayeux Tapestry, the embroidery consists of 27 panels, each , and shows 81 great events in British history during the 900 years from 1066 to 1966. It took 22 embroiderers 10 months to finish.

The Embroidery is worked in appliqué by hand, with the addition of couched threads and cords, tweed from Scotland, fabrics from the Victoria and Albert Museum, and feathers from London Zoo.
It was on public display in Hastings, firstly in the Town Hall and then on the pier in a dome-shaped building.

It is currently in storage, and apart from two panels on permanent display in the Town Hall, cannot be viewed, despite local protests. It has been said that to preserve the cloth and appliqué, special display facilities would have to be constructed, and that the cost of this would be prohibitive.

In March 2018 Hastings Borough Council announced that it would be &quot;very happy for any organization to have it free of charge to display&quot;, provided they have the space and appropriate conditions for preservation.

Between May and October 2019 all 27 panels of the Hastings Embroidery were displayed to the public in Rye, East Sussex, for the first time since it was locked up in storage. The exhibition was accompanied by an immersive media installation by Tim Hopkins and newly commissioned music piece entitled &quot;Stitched&quot; by Robert Thomas.

<doc id="90407" wikidata="Q249679" url="?curid=90407" title="Collingwood Football Club">
<text>The Collingwood Football Club, nicknamed the Magpies or colloquially the Pies, is a professional Australian rules football club based in Melbourne, Victoria that competes in the Australian Football League (AFL), the sport&#x27;s elite competition. Founded in 1892 in the Melbourne suburb of Collingwood, the club played in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) before joining seven other teams in 1896 to form the breakaway Victorian Football League (VFL), known today as the Australian Football League (AFL). Originally based at Victoria Park, Collingwood now plays home games at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and has its headquarters and training facilities at Olympic Park Oval and the AIA Centre.

Collingwood has played in a record 45 VFL/AFL Grand Finals (including rematches), winning 16 (tied with and ), drawing two and losing 27 (also a record). Regarded as one of Australia&#x27;s most popular sports teams, Collingwood, as of 2013, attracted the highest attendance figures and television ratings of any professional football club in the nation, across all codes. In 2023, it topped the AFL membership ladder with 106,470 members.
The club&#x27;s song, &quot;Good Old Collingwood Forever&quot;, dates back to 1906, making it the oldest team song currently used in the AFL. Its home guernsey consists of black and white stripes, based on the colours of the Australian magpie. Historically, the club&#x27;s biggest rivals have been neighbouring clubs Carlton and Richmond. Collingwood has also enjoyed a healthy Anzac Day rivalry with Essendon since 1995.

Collingwood fields a reserves team in the Victorian Football League (formerly the VFA) and women&#x27;s teams in the AFL Women&#x27;s and VFL Women&#x27;s competitions. It also owned and operated a netball team in the National Netball League from 2017 to 2023.

==History==

===Formation and early years===

The Collingwood Football Club was established on 12 February 1892.

Collingwood played its first game in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) against Carlton on 7 May 1892. The club won the VFA Premiership in 1896.

In 1897, Collingwood, along with fellow VFA clubs Fitzroy, Melbourne, St Kilda, Carlton, Essendon, South Melbourne and Geelong split from the VFA and formed the Victorian Football League (VFL).

Collingwood won its first premiership in 1902, defeating Essendon by 33 points in the 1902 VFL Grand Final.

===1920s and 1930s: Four consecutive premierships===

Collingwood was the most successful Victorian club of the 1920s and 1930s, appearing in 13 out of a possible 20 Grand Finals during the period. Collingwood were premiers six times during this time, including four consecutive premierships between 1927 and 1930, a VFL record, and two consecutive premierships in 1935 and 1936. The club&#x27;s coach during this period was Jock McHale, who served as coach from 1912 to 1949. Collingwood also had three Brownlow Medallists during the period, with Syd Coventry winning in 1927, Albert Collier in 1929 and Harry Collier in 1930. The club&#x27;s ruthlessly successful period later earned the club the nickname &quot;The Machine&quot;. American journalist and author Sam Walker included the Machine team in his book &quot;The Captain Class&quot;, which listed some the author&#x27;s greatest teams in the history of world sport.

The Collingwood team of 1927–30 not only achieved four straight premierships, but did so with a winning percentage of around 86% across the four seasons, and an average winning margin of about five goals. In 1929 they also became the only team in history to go through a home-and-away season undefeated. Collingwood remains the only club in the history of the VFL/AFL to have been declared premiers on four successive occasions.

=== 1950s: Two premierships ===

In the 1950s, the Melbourne Football Club enjoyed an era of unprecedented success, winning five premierships in six years (the last coming in 1960, and having been runner up in 1954). Collingwood lost two Grand Finals to Melbourne in this decade, but bounced back to win premierships in 1953 and 1958. Collingwood&#x27;s 1958 premiership is much cherished by the club as it prevented Melbourne from equalling Collingwood&#x27;s record four premierships in a row.

The 1958 premiership was however to be Collingwood&#x27;s last for 32 years, as the club was to suffer a string of Grand Final defeats in coming decades.

===1959–89: &quot;Colliwobbles&quot;===

A string of eight Grand Final losses, often by narrow margins, between 1960 and 1981 gave rise to a perception that the club was prone to &quot;choking&quot;, a phenomenon wittily dubbed &quot;Colliwobbles&quot;. Whether this perception is accurate remains a subject of debate; having only won one and drawn one of its last six Grand Finals. Lou Richards ceremoniously buried the Colliwobbles at Victoria Park after the club&#x27;s 1990 premiership.

===1990–99: Long-awaited premiership and struggles===
The 1990 premiership team, coached by Leigh Matthews and captained by Tony Shaw, had a one-sided grand final win against Essendon, the Magpies recording a 48-point victory and ending a 32-year premiership drought which included eight grand final losses and one draw. The sight of club great Darren Millane, who died in a car-crash one year later, holding the ball aloft in triumph at the final siren is one of the indelible images of the match.

After the drought-breaking premiership, the club lapsed into a state of decline for the remainder of the decade, culminating with the club&#x27;s second wooden spoon in 1999. The Magpies returned to finals, though were quickly eliminated, in the 1992 season against St Kilda and in the 1994 AFL season against West Coast. Matthews left as head coach at the end of the 1995 season and was replaced at the start of the following year by 1990 premiership captain Tony Shaw, who had only retired from football 18 months earlier. Mid-table finishes under Shaw were achieved for the next two seasons, before poor results in 1998 and 1999 saw Shaw announce his resignation.

===2000–11: The Malthouse era===
Media personality, sports journalist and administrator Eddie McGuire was elected President in October 1998. He oversaw the installation of new head coach Michael Malthouse in October 1999, whose appointment proved to be a masterstroke in reviving the club on-field. Under Malthouse, the acquisition and emergence of players such as Paul Licuria, Alan Didak, Anthony Rocca and Nathan Buckley resulted in Collingwood quickly moving up the ladder in the 2000 AFL season and in the 2001 AFL season, only narrowly missing the finals in the latter year. Collingwood met reigning premiers Brisbane in the 2002 Grand Final and were regarded as massive underdogs, eventually falling just 9 points short of an improbable premiership. Buckley, the captain, became just the third player to win the Norm Smith Medal as best afield in the Grand Final despite being a member of the losing side. Despite a very successful home-and-away next season, they were again defeated by the Lions in the 2003 Grand Final, this time in thoroughly convincingly fashion.

Following those Grand Final losses, Collingwood struggled for the next two years, finishing 13th in 2004 and second-last in 2005; the latter meant Collingwood was eligible for a priority pick which the club used to recruit Dale Thomas. Collingwood made a return to the finals in 2006, finishing fifth, but were defeated by the Western Bulldogs by 41 points in its elimination final. A loss to (who were on the bottom of the ladder at the time) late in the season ultimately cost them the double chance. The 2007 season saw them finish sixth on the ladder at season&#x27;s conclusion, and in the finals they knocked out the grand finalists of the past two years, Sydney, in the elimination final and then West Coast in overtime at Subiaco Oval in the semi-final. Having earned a preliminary final against , Collingwood lost to the eventual premiers, by five points in one of the most memorable preliminary finals in over a decade. Nathan Buckley would announce his retirement at season&#x27;s end after playing just five games in 2007 due to injury.

Collingwood finished eighth in the 2008 AFL season and were assigned an away final against at AAMI Stadium. After at one point trailing in the match, Collingwood went on to end Adelaide&#x27;s season and earn a semi-final meeting against . Having defeated the Saints in both their regular season meetings, Collingwood lost convincingly, ending their 2008 season. The 2009 season saw Collingwood finish inside the top-four for the first time since 2003, but in the qualifying final were beaten by minor premiers St Kilda convincingly. Having won a second chance, Collingwood struggled against Adelaide for the second year in a row before John Anthony kicked the match-winning goal with a minute left to send them into another preliminary final meeting with Geelong. But the season ended abruptly for the Magpies, with a 73-point loss to Geelong.

In 2010, Collingwood finished as minor premiers, and after wins in the qualifying and preliminary finals, reached the first Grand Final against . The match finished as a draw, forcing the first grand final replay in 33 years. Collingwood won the replay by 56 points. Key defensive player Nick Maxwell captained the club to victory and midfielder Scott Pendlebury (who had already won his first of eventually three Anzac medals earlier in the year) was awarded the Norm Smith Medal. The club won a second consecutive minor premiership in 2011, and qualified for the Grand Final after a three-point victory against Hawthorn in the preliminary final. However, Collingwood was then beaten by Geelong by 38 points in the decider, after trailing by seven points at three-quarter time. Following the Grand Final loss, which also marked the end of the club&#x27;s 2011 AFL season, Malthouse left Collingwood after deciding not to stay on as &quot;director of coaching&quot;. Star midfielder Dane Swan won the 2011 Brownlow Medal with a then-record 34 votes. Malthouse would leave having coached the club to eight finals series and four grand finals in 12 years.

===2012–2021: Coach Nathan Buckley===
Nathan Buckley, regarded as one of Collingwood&#x27;s greatest players, was appointed assistant coach under Malthouse for the 2010 and 2011 seasons, before assuming the head coaching position at the start of the 2012 season. Malthouse, who had been contracted to take on a &quot;head of coaching&quot; role, elected to leave the club rather than put Buckley in what he regarded as an awkward position. Under Buckley, Collingwood continued to be successful in the short term, qualifying inside the top-four in the 2012 season, before falling 26 points short in a preliminary final to eventual premiers the Sydney Swans at ANZ Stadium. The club qualified for finals once more in 2013, though were surprisingly eliminated in the first week by underdogs Port Adelaide at home. The result prompted the Magpies coaching staff to begin making radical changes to the club&#x27;s playing list, which saw premiership players Heath Shaw, Sharrod Wellingham, Heritier Lumumba among others leave for other clubs or retire. Over the next four years, younger talent was drafted but the club&#x27;s win–loss recorded continued to deteriorate. Collingwood failed to make finals from 2014 through to the end of the 2017 season, progressively sliding down the ladder each year. Buckley came under intense media pressure to resign or be sacked from his position, though club administrators elected to grant him a two-year extension to his contract in October 2017 after a broad-ranging internal review.

The emergence of new-generation players such as Taylor Adams, Adam Treloar and Jordan De Goey, alongside key talls Brodie Grundy and Mason Cox mixed well with veterans Pendlebury and Steele Sidebottom. Collingwood jumped from 13th in 2017 to 3rd in 2018, sensationally knocking out reigning premiers in the preliminary final before falling five points short after leading for most of the match against West Coast in the 2018 Grand Final, the senior team&#x27;s 27th defeat in a Grand Final. Buckley&#x27;s growth as a coach was partially credited for the rapid improvement. In 2019, Collingwood had another strong season, finishing fourth on the ladder, but they were unable to return to the Grand Final after a shattering four-point defeat to in the first preliminary final. In 2020, Collingwood finished 8th at the end of the home-and-away season.

The club made significant on-field and administrative changes in the late 2010s. It was a foundation member of the inaugural AFL Women&#x27;s competition in 2017 and in the same year established the Collingwood Magpies Netball team, a division of the club competing in the professional National Netball League. Collingwood unveiled a new permanent logo at the end of the 2017 season, which was the club&#x27;s 125th anniversary year.

====&quot;Do Better&quot; report====
In 2020, the club commissioned an independent review into claims of racism at the club. In February 2021, the report was leaked to journalists and revealed that &quot;while claims of racism have been made across the AFL, there is something distinct and egregious about Collingwood&#x27;s history&quot; and that &quot;what is clear is that racism at the club has resulted in profound and enduring harm to First Nations and African players. The racism affected them, their communities, and set dangerous norms for the public.&quot; Collingwood President Eddie McGuire suggested that the report signalled &quot;A historic and proud day&quot; for the media and club which was working towards addressing racism and that it &quot;was not a racist club&quot;. Many criticised McGuire&#x27;s response, including AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan, Héritier Lumumba, former Indigenous Collingwood player Tony Armstrong and a Victorian Senator, among others. McGuire later apologised for the remarks. On 4 February, 150 Collingwood players from the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams penned an open letter apologising &quot;to anyone who, through their association with our club, has been marginalised, hurt or discriminated against due to their race.&quot; First-grade footballer Darcy Moore said that the players were &quot;humiliated and shocked&quot; by the report&#x27;s findings. McGuire stood down as President of the Collingwood Football Club on 9 February 2021, although he had initially wanted to see the year through for a seamless transition until being compelled to step down.

Buckley stepped down after Round 13 of the 2021 AFL season, and assistant coach Robert Harvey took over as the caretaker coach until the end of the season. Harvey focused on developing youth and letting them play, with Collingwood winning 2 out of their 9 remaining games.

===2022–present: Coach Craig McRae===
In September 2021, Craig McRae was appointed as head coach of the club for the 2022 season and onwards. In his first season as Senior Coach, McRae led the club from a 17th place finish in the previous year, to 4th place on the ladder at the conclusion of the 2022 regular season, which included an 11 game winning streak and an AFL record of 11 separate wins by under 12 points. Collingwood would go on to lose two of their three Finals games in 2022 by a goal or less, losing to Geelong by 6 points in the Qualifying Final, and Sydney by 1 point in the Preliminary Final. McRae was awarded the Monjon Allan Jeans Senior Coach of the Year Award by the AFL Coaches Association for the 2022 season.

The 2023 season marked a shift in the club&#x27;s leadership, as long-time team captain Scott Pendlebury stepped down from the role he had held from 2014 to 2022. Darcy Moore was voted as the club&#x27;s new captain for the 2023 season and beyond.

The Magpies entered the 2023 season with the aim to build upon their strong performance in the 2022 season. Key offseason additions included Tom Mitchell (from Hawthorn), Bobby Hill (from GWS), and Billy Frampton (from Adelaide) through trades, and signing Dan McStay to the club as a free agent. Collingwood had a successful second season under Craig McRae, securing a total of 18 wins and 5 losses, and ultimately finishing first overall on the ladder. In the first Qualifying Final of the 2023 AFL Finals, Collingwood (9.6.60) defeated Melbourne (7.11.53) by 7 points. In the preliminary final, Collingwood (8.10.58) defeated the Giants (8.9.57) by 1 point, to secure a spot in the 2023 AFL Grand Final. In a closely contested match, Collingwood (12.18.90) defeated Brisbane (13.8.86) by 4 points to win the 2023 AFL Premiership, equalling the league-record of 16 VFL/AFL premierships for the club.

The 2024 season would prove to be a disappointment for the reigning premiers. Collingwood started the year poorly, losing the first three matches of their flag defence before recovering strongly to lose just once in the following eleven games. Despite this, the Magpies finished the season in indifferent fashion, winning just four of their last nine matches. 
They ultimately finished ninth with a record of 12 wins, nine losses and two draws, with percentage separating them from eighth-placed arch-rival Carlton. In doing so, Collingwood became the third reigning premier in four years (after Richmond in 2021 and Geelong in 2023) to miss the finals.

==Club symbols and identity==
===Guernsey===
Throughout the club&#x27;s history, Collingwood has worn a guernsey of black and white vertical stripes. The all white jumper, with the three black vertical stripes is the iconic strip that the club is most associated with. The current incarnation of the guernsey is mostly black, with white stripes on the front and lower half of the back, and white numbers. The main clash guernsey is the reverse of this: mostly white, with black stripes and black numbers, worn in away matches against clubs with a predominantly dark guernsey such as Fremantle and Port Adelaide. A secondary clash guernsey was introduced in 2011 and is used only in matches against North Melbourne due to similarity between the two uniforms. The alternate uniform is black with only two white stripes on each side instead of three.

Traditionally, Collingwood has worn a white guernsey with black stripes. The club switched to the black guernsey with white stripes in 2001.

Nike is the current manufacturer of the Magpies&#x27; apparel.

Collingwoods cultural reach and impact is far reaching as evidence by memberships, crowds, broadcast ratings and more recently, the emergence of influential digital media, such as the Pie Hard podcast.

===Song===

&quot;Good Old Collingwood Forever&quot; is the team song of the Collingwood Football Club. The lyrics were written by player Tom Nelson during Collingwood&#x27;s 1906 tour of Tasmania, making it the oldest of the team songs currently used in the AFL. It is sung to the tune of &quot;Goodbye, Dolly Gray&quot;, originally a song written in connection with the Spanish–American War, then a popular Boer War and First World War anthem. It is the only AFL team song to reference the barracker, an Australian rules football term for fan.

The current version of the song played at the ground during game day was recorded in 1972 by the Fable Singers. The lyrics are as follows:

: &quot;Good old Collingwood forever,&quot;
: &quot;They know how to play the game.&quot;
: &quot;Side by side, they stick together,&quot;
: &quot;To uphold the Magpies name.&quot;
: &quot;See, the barrackers are shouting,&quot;
: &quot;As all barrackers should.&quot;
: &quot;Oh, the premiership&#x27;s a cakewalk,&quot;
: &quot;For the good old Collingwood.&quot;
In 1983, the line &quot;Oh, the premiership&#x27;s a cakewalk&quot; was briefly changed to &quot;there is just one team we favour&quot; as it was felt to be embarrassing due to the long period the club had been without a premiership. However, the change was unpopular and was quickly reverted.

===Rivalries===

Carlton is considered to be the club&#x27;s most bitter arch-rival (for full details see Carlton–Collingwood AFL rivalry), with Richmond close behind.

Collingwood has also enjoyed a healthy Anzac Day rivalry with Essendon since 1995.

Collingwood&#x27;s two opponents in the themed Rivalry Rounds staged to date have been Carlton (2005–2006, 2009) and Richmond (2007–2008).

==== Richmond ====
Arising from the fact that the two areas neighbour each other, Richmond and Collingwood were both highly successful in the late 1920s to the early 1930s; the clubs played against each other in five grand finals between 1919 and 1929 (Collingwood won in 1919, 1927, 1928 and 1929, while Richmond won in 1920). In the 1980 Grand Final, Richmond handed Collingwood an 81-point defeat, a record at the time, causing Collingwood to lose an 8th Grand Finals in a row.

Both clubs continue to draw large crowds to their meetings in each season, and the two were the subject of a &#x27;recruiting war&#x27; throughout the 1970s and 1980s, with David Cloke, Geoff Raines, Brian Taylor, Wally Lovett, Phillip Walsh, Steven Roach, Gerald Betts, Neil Peart, Peter McCormack, Kevin Morris, Craig Stewart, Ross Brewer, Michael Lockman, Rod Oborne, Allan Edwards, John Annear, Noel Lovell and Bob Heard all exchanging clubs, as well as coach Tom Hafey (moving to Collingwood in 1977 following four flags at Punt Road).

Melees have been fought between the teams in two recent matches—Round 20, 2009, and Round 2, 2012—with almost all players from both teams involved in the altercations.

Both teams played each other 3 times during 2018, with all three games attracting massive crowds. Crowds of 72,157 and 88,180 were recorded between both home-and-away games, with Richmond winning both times, until Collingwood unexpectedly pulled off a massive upset in their finals game, smashing Richmond in the preliminary final in front of a crowd of 94,959, which caused the rivalry to reach its highest point since 1980. Games between these two clubs regularly attract large crowds regardless of whether they are in finals contention or not.

==== Essendon ====
Collingwood has enjoyed an Anzac Day rivalry with the Essendon Football Club since 1995, when the first Anzac Day clash took place. After the 2024 match, Collingwood have won this contest 17 times and Essendon 11 times, with the first and most recent match in 2024 ending in draws respectively.

==== Melbourne ====
The rivalry between Collingwood and Melbourne was at its peak between 1955 and 1964, when the two played off in the grand final on five occasions. This included the 1958 Grand Final where Collingwood&#x27;s victory prevented Melbourne from equalling Collingwood&#x27;s record of four premierships in succession (1927–1930). The old rivalry with Melbourne has faded in recent decades due to Melbourne not enjoying the same level of on-field success, however, it remains strong and is an annual scheduled fixture on the Kings Birthday public holiday.

===Headquarters, training and administration base===
Collingwood Football Club had its original training and administration base at Victoria Park from 1892 until 2004. In 2004, Collingwood Football Club moved its primary administrative and training base to the purpose-built Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Centre at the Olympic Park Complex. The Collingwood Football Club also used Olympic Park Stadium being adjacent to Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Centre as its outdoor training ground from 2004 until 2012, when it was demolished. After this occurred, Collingwood Football Club moved its outdoor training ground to the newly developed Olympic Park Oval that replaced the space of the stadium after demolition.

===Home Grounds===
The club&#x27;s original primary home ground, where they played their AFL home games was at Victoria Park 
from 1892 until 1999. Since 2000, The club&#x27;s primary home ground has been the Melbourne Cricket Ground, even though the club had already experimented playing home games at the venue since 1993, where in the period between 1994 and 1999, the club would play seven of its home games at the MCG, while retaining three at Victoria Park. Additionally, the club has played two home games a year at Marvel Stadium since 2014.

===Supporters===

Collingwood is a working-class suburb and the Collingwood Football Club supporter base traditionally came from the working class (though its supporter base today goes far beyond). Many of the club&#x27;s supporters who regularly attend games still come from the working class or from lower socio-economic groups, leading to jokes from supporters of other clubs which typically stereotype their Collingwood counterparts as poor, crude and ignorant.

Collingwood is traditionally reviled by non-Collingwood supporters (&quot;You either love &#x27;em or you hate &#x27;em&quot;). The dislike of the club by outsiders is said to have originated during the 1920s and 1930s, a period of great success for the club which drew the envy and resentment of other clubs. In this period, Collingwood was also perceived as a Catholic and Irish club, at a time when these groups were looked down upon by the rest of Australian society and subjected to a considerable degree of social exclusion.

According to a 2001 study, Collingwood″s old home ground of Victoria Park had a reputation as one of the worst venues for racial vilification, though it has also been said that the problem was similar at all grounds. Collingwood has however been involved in several high-profile incidents of this type, such as those involving indigenous players Nicky Winmar in 1993 and Adam Goodes in 2013. Michael Long″s accusation of racial vilification against Collingwood ruckman Damian Monkhorst in 1995 also led directly to the establishment of the AFL&#x27;s racial vilification regulations. In support of more inclusive sporting cultures, in 2010 the Australian fashion designer Shanaaz Copeland developed a Collingwood-inspired hijab for Muslim women.

==Corporate==

===Membership===
In 2011, Collingwood reached 70,000 members for the first time, creating a new AFL record, beating their own previous record of 58,249 set in 2010.

In 2023 (the year Collingwood won their 16th premiership), they broke the AFL membership record figure again with 106,470 members.

The club&#x27;s extensive membership base tends to be a large crowd-pulling power, which has caused the AFL to be accused of favouring Collingwood when scheduling to maximise the league&#x27;s attendance figures. However, the AFL states that this is due to other clubs requesting home games at the MCG against Collingwood.

===Off-field===
Collingwood was one of the last clubs to abandon its traditional stadium, Victoria Park. Collingwood now plays home games at the MCG. It now also has its headquarters situated in the former Glasshouse Entertainment Centre. Due to a sponsorship deal, this facility is known as &#x27;The AIA Centre&#x27;, and has been previously known by other names such as &#x27;The Lexus Centre&#x27;, &#x27;The Westpac Centre&#x27; and &#x27;The Holden Centre&#x27;, all due to sponsorship agreements.

On 9 March 2007, former Collingwood and Fitzroy defender Gary Pert was appointed the Magpies&#x27; CEO, seven weeks after Greg Swann departed for Carlton. In accepting the key Magpie post, Pert quit as a club director and as managing director of Channel 9 in Melbourne. In a press conference, it was stated that Collingwood has budgeted to turn over about $50 million that year and McGuire hoped the new administration would soon double that figure. &quot;A finance administration review has come up with how we are going to turn Collingwood in to its next phase of its life&quot;, McGuire said. &quot;What do we do to make ourselves go from a $45 million a year turnover business to a $100 million turnover business? &quot;They sound like big figures but in 1999 we turned over $13 million, so that is where we are heading as a football club.&quot;

On 24 July 2017, Pert resigned from his position as CEO of the club, with Peter Murphy replacing him as an interim CEO. In January 2023, former Collingwood player and 1990 premiership hero Craig Kelly took over from Mark Anderson as CEO of the club.

In July 2024, Collingwood was sued by its former head of First Nations strategy, Mark Cleaver, alleging that Collingwood CEO Craig Kelly had made offensive jokes and slurs about Indigenous culture.

===Sponsorship===
The Collingwood guernsey is the most valuable sports sponsorship in Australia. Collingwood has different guernsey sponsors for home and away matches, generating an estimated $6.3 million worth of media exposure for the primary sponsor and $5.7 million for the secondary sponsor. These sponsorships are ranked first and second in Australia. High-profile sponsors have included Emirates, Holden, CGU Insurance, and Westpac.

===Presidents===
There have been twelve presidents of the Collingwood Football Club. The first and founding president of Collingwood was former Collingwood Mayor and Victorian MP William Beazley. Beazley was president of Collingwood from the founding of the club in 1892 until 1911. The second president of Collingwood was Alfred Cross. However, Cross was only president for a brief period of time. Third was former Fitzroy and Collingwood player Jim Sharp. Sharp was president for ten years (1913–1923). The fourth president of Collingwood was another former player, Harry Curtis. Curtis currently is the longest serving president of Collingwood. Curtis served as president for twenty-six years. Another former player of Collingwood, Syd Coventry was the fifth president for Collingwood, serving twelve years between 1950 and 1962.

Tom Sherrin was the sixth president of Collingwood, serving from 1963 to 1974. Ern Clarke, president for one year, was the seventh president. John Hickey, Ranald Macdonald and Allan MacAlister all served as president during 1977 through to 1995. Eleventh president and former player, Kevin Rose, was the second most recent president of Collingwood. The twelfth, and second-longest serving president of Collingwood, is radio and television presenter, commentator and journalist Eddie McGuire. McGuire was president of Collingwood between 1998 and 2021. Club board members Mark Korda and Peter Murphy were interim co-presidents, following McGuire&#x27;s tenure. In April 2021, Korda was appointed the thirteenth president of Collingwood.

==Current playing squad==

==Reserves team==
The Collingwood reserves are the reserves team of the club. The latest iteration of the Collingwood reserves was created in 2008, and compete in the Victorian Football League.

===History===
The VFL/AFL operated a reserves competition from 1919 to 1991, and a &quot;de facto&quot; AFL reserves competition was run by the Victorian State Football League from 1992 to 1999. Collingwood fielded a reserves team in both of these competitions, allowing players who were not selected for the senior team to play for Collingwood in the lower grade. Initially, the Collingwood District Football Club operated as its official reserves side, however the Districts remained a stand-alone club. It was not until the end of the 1938 season that Collingwood took control over the Districts and formally made them the Collingwood reserves.

After the AFL reserves competition was disbanded at the end of 1999, the club fielded its reserves team in the Victorian Football League during the 2000 season.

In 2001, Collingwood reserves team was dissolved and the club entered into an affiliation with the VFL&#x27;s Williamstown Football Club, such that Williamstown served as a feeder team and reserves players for Collingwood played senior football for Williamstown. Williamstown won one VFL premiership during this time, in 2003.

Collingwood ended its affiliation with Williamstown after the 2007 season. The reserves team was re-established, and has competed in the VFL since 2008. Collingwood&#x27;s standalone reserves team&#x27;s best VFL result to date was a preliminary final appearance in the 2016 VFL season, in which it lost to eventual premiers Footscray by 119 points.

The reserves team currently splits home games between Olympic Park Oval and Victoria Park, although they do occasionally play at the MCG as a curtain raiser to Collingwood home matches, and uses the AFL team&#x27;s clash guernsey as its primary guernsey. The Collingwood VFL team is composed of both reserves players from the club&#x27;s primary and rookie AFL lists, and a separately maintained list of players eligible only for VFL matches.

==Women&#x27;s teams==

===AFL Women&#x27;s team===

In April 2016, the club launched a bid to enter a team in the inaugural AFL Women&#x27;s season in 2017. Meg Hutchins was appointed Women&#x27;s Football Operations Manager some weeks prior, and given the responsibility of crafting the bid.

The club was granted a license in June 2016, becoming one of eight teams to compete in the league&#x27;s first season.

In addition to her role off-field, Hutchins would become one of the club&#x27;s first players, along with marquees Moana Hope and Emma King. Collingwood selected a further 19 players in October&#x27;s inaugural draft as well as three non-drafted players and two first time footballing rookies. Dandenong Stingrays assistant and Victorian Metro Youth Girls head coach Wayne Siekman was appointed the team&#x27;s inaugural head coach in July 2016.

The AFL Women&#x27;s team is based at the club&#x27;s training and administration at Olympic Park, though often shares matches between the venue and the club&#x27;s spiritual home Victoria Park.

===VFL Women&#x27;s team===
The club began fielding its own team in the revamped VFL Women&#x27;s league from the start of the 2018 season. Many of the club&#x27;s AFLW athletes play for the VFLW team, though the majority of the team is made up of players who haven&#x27;t been drafted to an AFLW club. The VFL Women&#x27;s competition runs from May to September (after the AFL Women&#x27;s season has concluded) and Collingwood achieved success quickly in the league, claiming their first VFLW premiership in 2019.

==Cultural influence==
* David Williamson&#x27;s 1977 stage play, &quot;The Club&quot;, was inspired by the backroom dealings and antics of the Collingwood Football Club; although Collingwood is never mentioned by name. The 1980 film version of the play – directed by Bruce Beresford and starring John Howard, Jack Thompson, Graham Kennedy and Frank Wilson – is set at Collingwood and featured Collingwood players in speaking and non-speaking roles. The film was almost entirely shot on location at Victoria Park, both inside and on the actual oval.
* Judd Apatow&#x27;s 2009 film, &quot;Funny People&quot;, starring Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen, featured a scene with Australian actor Eric Bana trying to explain the rules of Australian rules football. During this scene Bana&#x27;s character, a St Kilda supporter, voices his dislike for Collingwood while watching a televised game.
* Adam Elliot&#x27;s 2009 clay-animated film, &quot;Mary and Max&quot;, features a scene with a school-yard bully, named Bernie Clifford, who wears a 1970s VFL-style Collingwood guernsey. A Collingwood garden gnome can also be seen in the film.
* In the 2010 independent Australian film &quot;&quot;, Joffa Corfe and Shane McRae star as a couple of knockabout handymen with a passion for the Collingwood Football Club.
*John Brack&#x27;s 1953 painting &quot;Three of the Players&quot; depicts three Collingwood players. The players are thought by some to be Lou Richards, Jack Regan and Phonse Kyne.
* The Melbourne-based architectural firm Edmond and Corrigan included Collingwood&#x27;s black and white stripes in the designs of many of their buildings, including the VCA Theatre and Niagara Galleries.

==Activism==
===Same Sex Marriage===
During the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey, Collingwood supported the Yes vote.

===Voice to Parliament===

<text>The Offspring is an American rock band formed in Garden Grove, California, in 1984. Originally formed under the name Manic Subsidal, the band consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Bryan &quot;Dexter&quot; Holland, lead guitarist Kevin &quot;Noodles&quot; Wasserman, bassist Todd Morse, multi-instrumentalist Jonah Nimoy and drummer Brandon Pertzborn. The Offspring is often credited (alongside fellow California punk bands Green Day, NOFX, Bad Religion, Rancid, Pennywise and Blink-182) for reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the 1990s. During their -year career, the Offspring has recorded eleven studio albums and sold more than 40 million records, making them one of the best-selling punk rock bands.

The Offspring&#x27;s longest-serving drummer was Ron Welty, who replaced original drummer James Lilja in 1987. He was replaced by Adam &quot;Atom&quot; Willard in 2003, who was replaced four years later by Pete Parada. Parada parted ways with the band in 2021 after he refused to be vaccinated against COVID-19, and was replaced two years later by Pertzborn. Gregory &quot;Greg K.&quot; Kriesel (one of the Offspring&#x27;s co-founders) was the band&#x27;s bassist until he was fired in 2018; this left Holland as the sole remaining original member. Kriesel was replaced by Todd Morse, who had been the Offspring&#x27;s touring guitarist since 2009. Morse&#x27;s position as touring member was filled by Jonah Nimoy, who became an official member in 2023.

After achieving a local following with their early releases, including their 1989 self-titled debut album and the vinyl-only EP &quot;Baghdad&quot; (1991), the Offspring signed with independent label Epitaph Records and released two albums: &quot;Ignition&quot; (1992) and &quot;Smash&quot; (1994). &quot;Smash&quot;, which contained the band&#x27;s first major hit &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;, is one of the best-selling albums released on an independent record label, selling over 11 million copies worldwide and helping to propel punk rock into the mainstream. The success of &quot;Smash&quot; attracted attention from major labels including Columbia Records, with whom the Offspring signed in 1996; their first album for the label, &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; (1997), did not match its predecessor&#x27;s success, but received favorable reviews and gold and platinum RIAA certifications. The band reached further success with its fifth album &quot;Americana&quot; (1998), from which three of the singles − &quot;Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)&quot;, &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Get a Job?&quot; and &quot;The Kids Aren&#x27;t Alright&quot; − became mainstream radio and MTV staples, while the album managed to sell over five million units in the US. Though their next two albums, &quot;Conspiracy of One&quot; (2000) and &quot;Splinter&quot; (2003), were not as successful as those from the previous decade, they were both critically acclaimed, with the former going platinum and the latter being certified gold. The Offspring&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace&quot; (2008), cemented their comeback on the strength of its second single &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Go Far, Kid&quot;, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; rock charts for eleven weeks and has since obtained platinum status. The band released no new studio albums between &quot;Days Go By&quot; (2012) and &quot;Let the Bad Times Roll&quot; (2021), but continued touring and released a series of one-off songs in the interim. Their latest studio album, &quot;Supercharged&quot;, was released on October 11, 2024.

==History==
===Early years (1984–1993)===

The foundations for the Offspring began with guitarist/vocalist Bryan &quot;Dexter&quot; Holland (who was a drummer at the time) and bassist Gregory &quot;Greg K.&quot; Kriesel playing music together in a garage in Cypress, California, in 1983. After hearing the T.S.O.L. album &quot;Change Today?&quot; at a party, and following a riot at a 1984 Social Distortion show, they decided to form a band called Manic Subsidal with Holland changing his role from drums to vocals and guitar. Holland recruited drummer James Lilja, on an agreement that Lilja would play in Manic Subsidal, if Holland joined Lilja&#x27;s band Clowns of Death. After Holland played with Clowns of Death, he asked the band&#x27;s guitarist Kevin &quot;Noodles&quot; Wasserman to join their band. This lineup played the band&#x27;s first show, taking a road trip to Santa Cruz to open for White Flag and Scared Straight, then playing a matinee the next day at Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco.

In 1986, after changing their name to the Offspring, the band released their first single; the 7-inch &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Waiting&quot;. They released the single on their self-made Black Label record company, named after the brand of beer. An earlier version of &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Waiting&quot; (then known as &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;) appeared on the long-out of print &quot;Subject to Blackout&quot; compilation tape released the same year. The Offspring also recorded a demo tape in 1986, which received a positive review in &quot;Maximum Rocknroll&quot; magazine. Lilja left the Offspring in 1987 to pursue a medical career in oncology and was replaced by Ron Welty, who was 16 years old at the time.

After recording another demo in 1988, the Offspring signed a record deal with small-time label Nemesis Records. In March 1989, the band teamed up with producer Thom Wilson (who had worked with the Adolescents, Dead Kennedys, Social Distortion, the Vandals, and Youth Brigade) to record their first album, titled &quot;The Offspring&quot;. Nemesis released the album in limited numbers and only on the 12-inch vinyl and cassette formats; the album was not released on CD until 1995. A six-week national tour followed. Noodles was stabbed during a performance at a Hollywood anti-nuclear benefit.

In 1991, the Offspring teamed up with Wilson again to produce the &quot;Baghdad&quot; 7-inch EP and a third demo tape. This EP and demo were instrumental to the band&#x27;s signing with Epitaph Records. In 1992, Thom Wilson and the Offspring returned to the studio to record their second album &quot;Ignition&quot;, which was released in October of that year. The band went on U.S. tours with Pennywise and Lunachicks, and a European tour with NOFX.

===Mainstream success with &quot;Smash&quot; (1994–1995)===
When the Offspring returned to the studio in January 1994 to record their third album, the band&#x27;s relations with producer Thom Wilson had begun to strain. Three months later, the Offspring released what would become their biggest selling album, titled &quot;Smash&quot;. The album was initially released to little mainstream attention until its lead single &quot;Come Out and Play&quot; received airplay from the Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM, helping to raise the band&#x27;s profile and eventually hitting number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; rock charts for two weeks in the summer of 1994.

The success of &quot;Come Out and Play&quot; not only propelled &quot;Smash&quot; to peak at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and receive simultaneous gold and platinum certification four months after its release, but it also helped bring punk rock into the mainstream and is often considered a breakthrough album for the then-underground pop-punk and skate punk scenes. The album&#x27;s next two singles, &quot;Self Esteem&quot; and &quot;Gotta Get Away&quot;, had similar success to &quot;Come Out and Play&quot; in both chart performance and radio airplay. &quot;Smash&quot; has continued to sell consistently well in the years since its release, setting an all-time record for most units sold by an independent label band at over 11 million records and having sold over six million copies in the U.S. by 2000. The album also sold very well outside of the U.S., particularly in Australia, where it debuted No. 1 on the ARIA Charts, and remained in that position for three weeks in 1995.

The Offspring toured extensively throughout 1994 and 1995 in support of &quot;Smash&quot;. In addition to opening for bands like Pennywise, Bad Religion, and SNFU, the band had already graduated to headliner status by the summer of 1994, when they toured North America with Guttermouth and Big Drill Car; toured Europe with Desaster Area, and then toured the US in the fall with Rancid.

Touring for &quot;Smash&quot; continued throughout the first half of 1995, playing their first shows in Japan and Australia (including appearances at Big Day Out) and headlining tour dates with bands like Weezer, Quicksand, No Use for a Name, the Vandals, and Lunachicks. By the end of the album&#x27;s supporting tour, the Offspring had started playing at larger venues such as theaters and arenas as opposed to the clubs and smaller venues they were previously accustomed to.

Also in 1995, the band bought out the rights to their first album. Holland and Kriesel had created their own record label Nitro Records and started signing bands. One of their first releases was a re-release of the band&#x27;s 1989 debut album, &quot;The Offspring&quot;. The label also signed a number of punk bands including the Vandals, Guttermouth, Jughead&#x27;s Revenge, and AFI. Soon after, Nitro Records became solely Holland&#x27;s responsibility.

===&quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot;, &quot;Americana&quot;, and &quot;Conspiracy of One&quot; (1996–2002)===

In 1996, after the success of &quot;Smash&quot;, the Offspring left Epitaph and signed with Columbia Records. Epitaph retained its rights to release the next album in Europe, while Columbia had it for all other territories. The band&#x27;s attorney Peter Paterno had issued a letter to Epitaph stating that the band had &quot;substantial and fundamental reasons&quot; for wanting to leave the label and that Epitaph had &quot;breached its contract&quot;.

The band began writing and recording their fourth album, titled &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot;, in 1996. The album was released on February 4, 1997, which was also Noodles&#x27; 34th birthday. This album was not as successful as &quot;Smash&quot;, although it did sell four million units and spawned five singles. The album saw the band move away from the political-punk themes common to many Epitaph bands and more into mainstream rock with songs like &quot;Gone Away&quot; and &quot;I Choose&quot;; the video for the latter was directed by Holland himself. Dexter commented that &quot;Ixnay&quot; was probably not as well received as &quot;Smash&quot; because it was such a departure, and that many fans probably were expecting &quot;Smash Part Two&quot;.

In 1998, the Offspring released &quot;Americana&quot;. Three of the album&#x27;s singles, &quot;Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)&quot;; &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Get a Job?&quot;; and &quot;The Kids Aren&#x27;t Alright&quot;, became the band&#x27;s biggest hits and made the album the peak of the Offspring&#x27;s mainstream popularity. The former song topped the charts in nine countries including Australia, Japan, Norway, and the United Kingdom. &quot;She&#x27;s Got Issues&quot; was also released as a single and was a minor hit.

In 1999, the band appeared as themselves in the film &quot;Idle Hands&quot;. They played a cover version of &quot;I Wanna Be Sedated&quot; (originally by the Ramones) and &quot;Beheaded&quot; at a school dance before Holland&#x27;s character is killed. They also appeared at the infamous Woodstock &#x27;99, where their performance was broadcast live on pay-per-view television.

2000 saw the band release their sixth album, &quot;Conspiracy of One&quot;. The band intended to release the entire album online through their website to show their support for downloading music on the internet. However, under threat of legal action by Columbia through their parent company Sony, only the first single &quot;Original Prankster&quot; was released on their website (the rest of the record was leaked to fan sites). The band also sold T-shirts on their website with the Napster logo on it and donated money to Napster creator Shawn Fanning with the profits.

The band also released a single &quot;Defy You&quot; exclusively for the film &quot;Orange County&quot;.

===Ron Welty&#x27;s departure, &quot;Splinter&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (2003–2005)===

Longtime drummer Ron Welty left the group in 2003 to play in Steady Ground, a band in which he played drums and co-produced (they broke up in 2007). It was later revealed that Welty was fired by Holland and Noodles &quot;without any prior notice&quot;. That same year, the band released their seventh album, &quot;Splinter&quot;. The Offspring recruited Josh Freese to record the drums for &quot;Splinter&quot; and later announced that former Rocket from the Crypt drummer Atom Willard would be the replacement for Welty. The first single, &quot;Hit That&quot;, had moderate success on MTV. &quot;Hit That&quot; used a variety of electronic samples, different from what the Offspring has done in the past.

In 2005, the band released a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album in both DualDisc and regular CD editions. &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; contains 14 of the band&#x27;s hits between &quot;Smash&quot; and &quot;Splinter&quot;, and two previously unreleased songs, &quot;Can&#x27;t Repeat&quot; and &quot;Next to You&quot; (a cover of the Police song available as a hidden track). The compilation does not include any songs from the band&#x27;s first two albums. The DualDisc contains video of Dexter and Noodles discussing the band&#x27;s history and a bonus acoustic version of the song &quot;Dirty Magic&quot;. About a month later, the band released a video DVD with all of their music videos and some videos from a live show.

During the summer of 2005, the band played the Vans Warped Tour for the first time and followed that with a European and Japanese tour. After the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; world tour, the band took a break from writing, recording, and touring. During the hiatus, Willard was recruited by Tom DeLonge for his band Angels &amp; Airwaves and released an album, &quot;We Don&#x27;t Need to Whisper&quot;, in 2006.

===&quot;Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace&quot; (2006–2009)===

In November 2006, it was reported that the Offspring were back in the studio recording their eighth studio album &quot;Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace&quot; with producer Bob Rock and &quot;a fistful of demos&quot;. In July 2007, Dexter announced that the band had finished two more songs and the album was being recorded in Orange County, California.

It was announced on July 27, 2007, that former Saves the Day drummer Pete Parada had been chosen to be the Offspring&#x27;s new drummer, replacing Atom Willard, who went to focus on Angels and Airwaves. The band&#x27;s first shows with Parada were at the Summer Sonic festival in Japan in August 2007. It was during these shows that the band debuted &quot;Hammerhead&quot;, which would become the first single from the new album. Parada did not record on the new album due to contract issues however; Josh Freese once again handled drum duties as he did with &quot;Splinter&quot;.

The Offspring co-headlined the Australian Soundwave Festival during February and May 2008 alongside Incubus and Killswitch Engage.
On April 9, 2008, Dexter announced that the album would be called &quot;Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace&quot; and would be released on June 17. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Hammerhead&quot;, went to radio on May 6. Additionally, the Offspring&#x27;s website provided an MP3 download of the song to the general public on May 5. The second single from the album, &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Go Far, Kid&quot;, had topped the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart and stayed there for 11 weeks, a record for the band. It was also the Offspring&#x27;s only RIAA Gold song, proving it to be one of the most successful singles the band had released in their over 20-year career. Despite this, &quot;Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace&quot; has never received any RIAA certifications.

Also in April 2008, Epitaph Records announced that the label would be reissuing &quot;Ignition&quot; and &quot;Smash&quot;; both albums were remastered and &quot;Smash&quot; contained a new 24-page booklet. The reissues were released on the same day as &quot;Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace&quot;, coinciding with the new album&#x27;s release.

The supporting tour for the album began on May 16 with a performance at the X-Fest festival in California. On May 28, it was announced on the band&#x27;s website that Scott Shiflett (from Face to Face) would replace bassist Greg K. on current tour dates due to a birth in the family. Kriesel returned in mid-June. In October, with the addition of touring guitarist Andrew Freeman, the band embarked on a three-week Japanese tour followed by a South American tour.

On December 13, 2008, the Offspring headlined the nineteenth annual KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas. In an interview at the Almost Acoustic Christmas show, guitarist Noodles stated that the Offspring would be taking a break for a month or two and promised a US tour to kick off in 2009. They toured North America on their &quot;Shit is Fucked Up&quot; tour from May through July with Dropkick Murphys, Alkaline Trio, Street Dogs, Pennywise, Shiny Toy Guns, Sum 41, and Frank Turner.

===&quot;Days Go By&quot; (2010–2013)===
In May 2010, the band started doing preliminary work for what would be the ninth Offspring album with Bob Rock in Hawaii. They recorded sporadically throughout the next year. In June 2010 the Offspring headlined two dates in Western Canada. The Offspring took a break from the studio in order to join 311 on their summer 2010 Unity Tour. The 19-date tour was held in amphitheaters around the U.S. and also featured Pepper as a special guest. Before the 311 and Pepper tour, the Offspring played four West Coast dates in June, which were supported by Terrible Things. In January 2011, session drummer Josh Freese (who recorded drum tracks for the band&#x27;s last two albums) mentioned on his website that he was in the studio working with the Offspring again. Ronnie King had also confirmed that he would appear as the album’s keyboardist after performing the same role on &quot;Splinter&quot;. The band interrupted their work in 2011 in order to tour and took the main stage at the 2011 Reading and Leeds Festivals.

After the tour, the band started recording in earnest and it was later announced that the album was in the mixing stage. They headlined the PunkSpring Festival in Japan on March 31, 2012, in Tokyo and on April 1, 2012, in Osaka with Sum 41, New Found Glory, and All Time Low. At one of the shows, the Offspring performed a new song called &quot;The Future Is Now&quot;. They were also confirmed to play at the Rock am Ring/im Park and Novarock festivals in the summer 2012. Prior to that, the band would be playing at the 20th annual KROQ Weenie Roast, which was to take place at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre in Irvine, California, on May 5, 2012.

In March 2012, the band announced on their Twitter page that the album was finished. On April 20, 2012, Kevin and Bean announced that the Offspring&#x27;s new single &quot;Days Go By&quot; would be premiered on April 27. Three days later, the band announced on their website that &quot;Days Go By&quot; would be the name of their ninth studio album, which was eventually released on June 26, 2012. On April 30, 2012, the band released another song from &quot;Days Go By&quot;, &quot;Cruising California (Bumpin&#x27; in My Trunk)&quot;.

In early fall 2012, the Offspring toured with Neon Trees and Dead Sara. They were co-headliners of the Soundwave in Australia in 2013 alongside Metallica and Linkin Park. After this, they performed at the 20th annual WJRR Earthday Birthday on April 13, 2013, and at the Gulfport Music Festival a month later. The Offspring spent much of the spring, summer, and fall of 2013 playing shows in Europe, the United States, and South America. In November and December 2013, they played the Warped Tour for the first time in eight years, this time in Australia.

On June 20, 2013, it was reported that the Offspring was working on a live album with engineer Ian Charbonneau. Instead of a standard release, the live album (which was recorded in Warsaw, Poland at the Orange Warsaw Festival held at Narodowy Stadium) would have had been released online but to date has not come to fruition.

===Touring and Round Hill Music (2014–2016)===
The Offspring spent the summer of 2014 on tour commemorating the of their third album &quot;Smash&quot;. They headlined the Summer Nationals 2014 tour from July to September with support from their former labelmates Bad Religion and Pennywise as well as the Vandals, Stiff Little Fingers, and Naked Raygun. To coincide with the Summer Nationals tour, the Offspring released cover versions of Pennywise&#x27;s &quot;No Reason Why&quot; and Bad Religion&#x27;s &quot;Do What You Want&quot; and &quot;No Control&quot; on their YouTube account. These cover versions were released on the EP &quot;Summer Nationals&quot;, which was released digitally in August 2014. On December 24, 2014, Radio Contraband announced on their Facebook page that they would premiere the Offspring&#x27;s new single, &quot;Coming for You&quot;, on January 30, 2015. The Offspring toured in support of the &quot;Coming for You&quot; single and performed their 1998 album &quot;Americana&quot; in its entirety at the Amnesia Rockfest on June 19, 2015, in Montebello, Canada.

The Offspring reclaimed the rights to their Columbia Records albums in 2014. The band started auctioning off the rights to those albums in August 2015 (as well as their songwriting credits) for around $30 million. Sony Music Entertainment (the owner of Columbia Records) and Round Hill Music were allegedly interested in bidding for the Offspring&#x27;s music. In January 2016, Round Hill acquired the band&#x27;s Columbia Records catalogue and their career-long music publishing rights for $35 million. In December 2016, Round Hill signed a distribution deal with Universal Music Enterprises for the Offspring&#x27;s Columbia catalog (including the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album). By September 2015, the band had finished two to three tracks. On July 20, 2016, a new Offspring song &quot;Sharknado&quot; premiered, which was recorded for the film &quot;&quot;.

===&quot;Let the Bad Times Roll&quot; and split with Greg K. and Pete Parada (2017–2021)===
Noodles was absent from the Offspring&#x27;s 2017 tour with Sublime with Rome due to a &quot;sudden family matter&quot;; filling in for him on dates were Tom Thacker and Jonah Nimoy. That year, Holland earned a PhD in molecular biology from the University of Southern California.

On June 9, 2018, the Offspring debuted one song expected to appear on the new album, &quot;It Won&#x27;t Get Better&quot;, while performing at the Greenfield Festival in Switzerland. On July 20, 2018, it was announced the Offspring would release a cover of 311&#x27;s &quot;Down&quot; and 311 would release a &quot;reggaefied&quot; cover of the Offspring&#x27;s &quot;Self Esteem&quot;, which 311&#x27;s lead singer Nick Hexum referred to as &quot;probably [his] favorite song of theirs;&quot; the cover versions coincided with the co-headlining Never Ending Summer tour.

On November 11, 2018, founding bassist Greg K. was fired from the Offspring. He was replaced on the band’s headline Australian and Japan tours by No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal. After the tours ended, touring rhythm guitarist Todd Morse became a full-time member, replacing Kriesel. In August, Greg K. filed a lawsuit against Holland and Wasserman following an alleged decision by the two in November 2018 to ban Kriesel from the band&#x27;s activities, including studio recordings and live performances. Holland and Noodles later sued Kriesel back, stating that &quot;Kriesel&#x27;s arguments have no basis in fact&quot; and that &quot;there could be no such thing as an oral, permanent partnership, or a partnership which required two people to perform in perpetuity&quot;. Holland and Noodles also claimed that Kriesel apparently was asked and agreed to leave the band after &quot;differences developed between how both parties viewed the band&#x27;s present and future.&quot; They further claimed that they attempted to &quot;negotiate in good faith&quot; to purchase his shares in the band and present him his chunk of the band&#x27;s assets and those assets included The Offspring trademark and various royalty payments. Kriesel allegedly refused that deal, suing the band instead. The case was settled out of court in 2023.

On April 21, 2020, the Offspring released a rock cover of Joe Exotic&#x27;s country song &quot;Here Kitty Kitty&quot; popularized by the 2020 Netflix documentary &quot;Tiger King&quot;. It was recorded while the band was in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a June 2020 interview with Download TV, Holland confirmed that the new album was &quot;basically done&quot; but added that its release was &quot;on hold at the moment&quot; because of the pandemic. 

In September 2020, Welty filed a lawsuit against the Offspring for unpaid royalties. Welty claimed he was owed millions more profits from the Offspring’s $35 million catalog sale and that former bandmate Dexter Holland tried to “erase” his contributions to the band&#x27;s career by failing to pay him his rightful cut of the sale of the band’s rights to Round Hill Music in 2015. Welty lost the case in March 2023 with the judge stating that some of Welty’s allegations were “completely illogical.”

On November 4, 2020, the Offspring released a Christmas song, a cover of Darlene Love&#x27;s &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot;. A physical version was released as a 7-inch vinyl single on December 11, 2020. On November 13, the Offspring uploaded a lyric video for their song &quot;Huck It!&quot; and announced a vinyl re-release of &quot;Conspiracy of One&quot; for its 20th anniversary. On February 23, 2021, the Offspring announced their tenth album, &quot;Let the Bad Times Roll&quot;, and released the title track as its lead single through streaming services; the album was released on April 16.

On August 2, 2021, Parada announced he had been fired from the Offspring as he had declined to be vaccinated against COVID-19. He said he acted on the advice of his doctor, as he suffers from Guillain–Barré syndrome. In an interview published in November 2021, Holland and Wasserman denied that Parada had been fired and instead said they had been forced to hire other drummers for the safety of their crew on tour. In an interview on March 4, 2023, Parada confirmed that he was no longer a member of the Offspring. He formed a new band, the Defiant. Parada was replaced on tour by Josh Freese.

===&quot;Supercharged&quot; and Brandon Pertzborn&#x27;s arrival (2022–present)===

In a September 2022 interview with Brazilian radio station 89FM A Rádio Rock, Holland confirmed that the Offspring had begun working on new material for their eleventh studio album: &quot;...[W]e wanna keep things rolling. We had to take time off in the pandemic and we feel like, &#x27;We&#x27;re back at it. Let&#x27;s make the most of it right now.&#x27;&quot; Holland told &quot;Times Colonist&quot; in November that the band would begin recording their new album in January 2023 with Bob Rock.

On May 12, 2023, former Black Flag, Suicidal Tendencies and Marilyn Manson drummer Brandon Pertzborn announced that he had joined the Offspring as their new drummer to replace Josh Freese, who was unable to perform with the band because of commitments with the Foo Fighters as a replacement for Taylor Hawkins, who died in 2022. After Pertzborn&#x27;s arrival, touring member Jonah Nimoy became an official member. On August 6, 2023, the original Offspring drummer, James Lilja, joined the Offspring on stage for the first time in 36 years and performed, &quot;Beheaded&quot;, which he co-wrote with Holland.

In a May 2024 interview with Atlanta&#x27;s 99X radio station, Holland and guitarist Noodles confirmed that the band&#x27;s eleventh studio album was finished and that they were working on the cover art and album title. The following month, it was announced that the album was titled &quot;Supercharged&quot; and would be released on October 11. The first single from the album, &quot;Make It All Right&quot;, was released on June 7.

==Style and influences==
The Offspring has been labeled primarily as punk rock, and punk subgenres including hardcore punk, melodic hardcore, pop-punk, and skate punk. They have also been labeled as alternative rock. In the &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; (1995), Chuck Eddy writes: &quot;If Green Day Americanizes the Buzzcocks&#x27; heartfelt late-&#x27;70s pop-punk love-songs-for-British-birds, the Offspring Americanize Sham 69&#x27;s heavy rock-punk fight-songs-for-blokes. But biology-Ph.D.-candidate singer Dexter Holland cheerfully bounces around the &#x27;luded-out metal riffs instead of just gobbing out hardcorps spitballs.&quot; A signature style of the Offspring are their chorused &quot;whoas&quot;, &quot;heys&quot;, and/or &quot;yeahs&quot;. The band&#x27;s former labelmates NOFX poked fun at them for this in their song &quot;Whoa on the Whoas&quot;. Several tracks also incorporate elements of Eastern music, which can be heard on the likes of &quot;Tehran&quot;, &quot;Me &amp; My Old Lady&quot;, &quot;Pay the Man&quot;, &quot;Dividing By Zero&quot;, and the verse hook from &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;. Their lyrics cover a wide range of topics, like personal relationships, such as in their songs &quot;She&#x27;s Got Issues&quot;, &quot;Self Esteem&quot; and &quot;Spare Me the Details&quot;, and the degradation of the United States, politics, and society in general with songs like &quot;It&#x27;ll Be a Long Time&quot;, &quot;Americana&quot; and &quot;Stuff Is Messed Up&quot;. The lyrics generally reflect a sarcastic viewpoint, which, along with the language, can be offensive to some. This is acknowledged in the opening track from their fourth album &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot;, &quot;Disclaimer&quot;, which is sarcastic itself. Like &quot;Disclaimer&quot;, the first track of most of the Offspring&#x27;s albums are an introduction of some sort; &quot;Time to Relax&quot; (from &quot;Smash&quot;), &quot;Welcome&quot; (from &quot;Americana&quot;), &quot;Intro&quot; (from &quot;Conspiracy of One&quot;), and &quot;Neocon&quot; (from &quot;Splinter&quot;) are also examples of this.

The Offspring has cited various punk bands as influences, including the Dickies, the Sex Pistols, the Misfits, T.S.O.L., Agent Orange, the Adolescents, the Ramones, the Clash, the Dead Kennedys, Bad Religion, the Circle Jerks, the Descendents, GBH, Hüsker Dü, Social Distortion, Suicidal Tendencies, and the Vandals. The band&#x27;s other influences and inspirations are classic rock bands Creedence Clearwater Revival, Kiss and Led Zeppelin, new wave acts the B-52s, the Cars and Devo, and British Invasion groups, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Who.

==Impact and legacy==
With the mainstream success of &quot;Smash&quot;, going six times multi-platinum and earning worldwide airplay, the Offspring&#x27;s impact persists to this day. As one of the most popular punk bands of the 1990s, they are credited with reviving popular interest in punk rock and bringing the genre back into the mainstream, and have influenced younger artists such as Avril Lavigne and Simple Plan. The Los Angeles modern rock radio station KROQ listed the Offspring at No. 21 in &quot;The KROQ Top 106.7 Artists of 1980–2008&quot; Countdown by Year memorial, with 30 appearances on the station&#x27;s year-end countdowns as of 2008.

The Offspring&#x27;s music has appeared in movies, such as &quot;The Chase&quot;, &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, &quot;The Faculty&quot;, &quot;Varsity Blues&quot;, &quot;Wanted&quot;, &quot;Idle Hands&quot; (which also features a cameo by the band), &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot;, &quot;Loser&quot;, &quot;Tomcats&quot;, &quot;Bubble Boy&quot;, &quot;The Animal&quot;, &quot;American Pie 2&quot;, &quot;Orange County&quot;, &quot;The New Guy&quot;, &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;, &quot;Pauly Shore Is Dead&quot;, &quot;Click&quot;, &quot;How to Eat Fried Worms&quot; (for the trailer), &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. &quot;Mota&quot;, &quot;Amazed&quot;, &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; (all from &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot;) were featured in Warren Miller&#x27;s 1997 documentary &quot;Snowriders II&quot;.

&quot;Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)&quot; can be heard in the &quot;King of the Hill&quot; episode &quot;Escape From Party Island&quot;. &quot;Original Prankster&quot; was featured in &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; episode &quot;American Prankster&quot;. &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Go Far, Kid&quot; was featured in the &quot;90210&quot; episode &quot;We&#x27;re Not in Kansas Anymore&quot;, while &quot;Kristy, Are You Doing Okay?&quot; appeared in the episode &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot;. In the &quot;Close Enough&quot; episode &quot;The Weird Kid&quot;, a subplot concerned a character accidentally wishing to become obsessed with the Offspring; various references to their work can be heard throughout. Self Esteem can also be heard on the TV Show: Daria when she visits university with her parents.

In video games, the Offspring&#x27;s songs have appeared in &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot;, &quot;Crazy Taxi 2&quot;, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot; and &quot;SingStar Rocks!&quot;. &quot;Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)&quot; appears in &quot;Guitar Hero: Van Halen&quot;. &quot;Hammerhead&quot;, &quot;Gone Away&quot;, &quot;Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)&quot;, &quot;Self Esteem&quot;, &quot;All I Want&quot;, &quot;The Kids Aren&#x27;t Alright&quot;, &quot;A Lot Like Me&quot; and &quot;Days Go By&quot; are downloadables for the &quot;Rock Band&quot; series. &quot;Hammerhead&quot; was also featured in the football video game &quot;Madden NFL 09&quot;. &quot;Days Go By&quot; was featured in &quot;NHL 13&quot;. From September 20 to October 7, 2019, the band performed a virtual concert in World of Tanks, with a limited-edition tank. The tank has instruments (and skateboards) stacked on top of its hull, &quot;Pretty fly&quot; painted on the side armour, and band members acting as the crew.

&quot;Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)&quot; received a parody treatment by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic as &quot;Pretty Fly for a Rabbi&quot;.

<text>Mystic Records is an American record label and music production company specializing in hardcore punk, crossover thrash, underground music, vintage and cult records. It is owned and operated by Doug Moody. The label was first established in Hollywood, California, and subsequently moved its operations to Oceanside, California. Mystic Records is an independent label and is a member of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

==History==
===Background===
Mystic Records is closely associated with the personality of its founder, Doug Moody, regarded as a pioneer of the independent rock and roll industry. Moody&#x27;s father, Walter Moody, was himself an influential figure in the music industry, running EMI Studios (Abbey Road Studios) in London during the 1930s. In 1953 the family moved to the United States.

Moody decided to himself become involved in the music business, first working in the A&amp;R department of Silvertone Records in New Jersey. A series of music industry jobs followed throughout the decades of the 1960s and 1970s, including stints in various capacities at Kama Sutra Records, 20th Century Fox, and A&amp;M Records.

===Studio and label===
Seeking another place in the music industry outside of the major record labels, Moody opened a recording studio in Hollywood, California, at the location of the old Mustang Studios, made famous as a facility used by the Bobby Fuller Four. Moody changed out the studio&#x27;s superannuated 2 track mono recording gear and replaced it with state of the art 8-track stereo gear, leaving the recording rooms otherwise largely unaltered.

In tandem with the studio was launched the Mystic Records label. During the label&#x27;s peak period of activity, from 1982 through 1990, Mystic released over 200 records, many of which were multi-band compilations, involving the work of several hundred artists. Emerging as a prominent force in the Southern California punk rock music scene, Mystic put out an array of alternative bands, with an emphasis on the hardcore punk, crossover thrash, and speed metal styles in vogue during this period.

Moody claimed to have invested $70,000 in the label in 1983 alone, but taking into account recording costs and sales figures averaging about 2,000 copies per record, found the operation with about $40,000 left to recover at the end of that year. Bands would purchase studio time, with Mystic recouping its investment against royalties due, which in 1984 Moody claimed was approximately 40 cents per record.

In conjunction with the label, Moody and Mystic established its own wholesale record distribution branch, MD Distributing. This distributorship handled not only Mystic releases but those of other labels as well.

===Bands===
Some of the best known artists on Mystic Records include NOFX, RKL, Battalion of Saints, Ill Repute, Agression, and The Mentors. Mystic Records has also released vinyl compilations featuring Suicidal Tendencies, Love Canal, New Regime, Black Flag, False Alarm, Duct Tape Hostage, SIN 34, Government Issue, The Minutemen, Burning Image, Habeas Corpus, and Bad Religion.

===Importance===
Mystic Records has been credited with several innovations in the independent record industry of the 1980s. It introduced Super Sevens (7-inch 33rpm extended play records featuring seven songs) and helped popularize the manufacture of limited edition records on colored vinyl. one of the most interesting releases was from the band titled “The Sharks” (later Shark Island). This custom shaped single, executive producer Jeff Willmitt, had 3 outer edge “shark fins” that when inserted into the sleeve appeared to cut through the water. The label was also influential through its release of multi-band compilation albums, such as its &quot;The Sound of Hollywood&quot; series, and promotional label samplers making use of album tracks, typified by its &quot;Mystic Sampler&quot; series.

Additionally, Moody worked to define new genres of music such as &quot;METALCORE,&quot; which he described in 1984 Press Release as &quot;a mixture of hardcore, fast paced thrash music with double drumming &amp; Heavy Metal screaming guitars.&quot;

Moody&#x27;s key collaborators on the Mystic Records project included producer and engineer Phillip &quot;Philco&quot; Raves, sales and distribution Randy Boyd of Cobraside Distribution, promotion director Mark Wilkins, and Candace D&#x27;Andrea who is Chief Operating Officer.

<text>Joseph Vernon &quot;Big Joe&quot; Turner Jr. (May 18, 1911 – November 24, 1985) was an American blues shouter from Kansas City, Missouri. According to songwriter Doc Pomus, &quot;Rock and roll would have never happened without him&quot;. Turner&#x27;s greatest fame was due to his rock and roll recordings in the 1950s, particularly &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot;, but his career as a performer endured from the 1920s into the 1980s.

Turner was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, with the Hall lauding him as &quot;the brawny voiced &#x27;Boss of the Blues. AllMusic called Turner &quot;the premier blues shouter of the postwar era&quot;.

==Career==
===Early days===
Turner was born May 18, 1911, in Kansas City, Missouri, United States. His father was killed in a train accident when Turner was four years old. He sang in his church, and on street corners for money. He left school at age fourteen to work in Kansas City&#x27;s nightclubs, first as a cook and later as a singing bartender. He became known as &quot;The Singing Barman&quot;, and worked in such venues as the Kingfish Club and the Sunset, and would frequently perform at these venues alongside his friend Pete Johnson on piano. The Sunset was managed by Piney Brown. It featured &quot;separate but equal&quot; facilities for white patrons. Turner wrote &quot;Piney Brown Blues&quot; in his honor and sang it throughout his career.

At that time Kansas City nightclubs were subject to frequent raids by the police; Turner said, &quot;The Boss man would have his bondsmen down at the police station before we got there. We&#x27;d walk in, sign our names and walk right out. Then we would cabaret until morning.&quot;

His partnership with Johnson proved fruitful. Together they went to New York City in 1936, where they appeared on a playbill with Benny Goodman, but as Turner recounted, &quot;After our show with Goodman, we auditioned at several places, but New York wasn&#x27;t ready for us yet, so we headed back to K.C.&quot; Eventually they were seen by the talent scout John Hammond in 1938, who invited them back to New York to appear in one of his &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot; concerts at Carnegie Hall, which were instrumental in introducing jazz and blues to a wider American audience.

In part because of their appearance at Carnegie Hall, Turner and Johnson had a major success with the song &quot;Roll &#x27;Em Pete&quot;. The track was basically a collection of traditional blues lyrics. It was a song that Turner recorded many times, with various musicians, over the ensuing years.

===1939 to 1950===
In 1939, along with the boogie-woogie pianists Albert Ammons and Meade Lux Lewis, Turner and Johnson began a residency at Café Society, a nightclub in New York City, where they appeared on the same playbill as Billie Holiday and Frankie Newton&#x27;s band. Besides &quot;Roll &#x27;Em, Pete&quot;, Turner&#x27;s best-known recordings from this period are probably &quot;Cherry Red&quot;, &quot;I Want a Little Girl&quot; and &quot;Wee Baby Blues&quot;. &quot;Cherry Red&quot; was recorded in 1939 for the Vocalion label, with Hot Lips Page on trumpet and a full band in attendance. During the next year Turner contracted with Decca and recorded &quot;Piney Brown Blues&quot; with Johnson on piano.

In 1941, he went to Los Angeles and performed in Duke Ellington&#x27;s revue &quot;Jump for Joy&quot; in Hollywood. He appeared as a singing policeman in a comedy sketch, &quot;He&#x27;s on the Beat&quot;. Los Angeles was his home for a time, and during 1944 he worked in Meade Lux Lewis&#x27;s Soundies musical movies. He sang on the soundtrack recordings but was not present for filming, and his vocals were mouthed by the comedian Dudley Dickerson for the camera. In 1945 Turner and Pete Johnson established the Blue Moon Club, a bar in Los Angeles.

In 1945, he also signed a recording contract with National Records, for which he recorded under the supervision of Herb Abramson. His first hit single was a cover of Saunders King&#x27;s &quot;S.K. Blues&quot; (1945). He recorded the songs &quot;My Gal&#x27;s a Jockey&quot; and the risqué &quot;Around the Clock&quot; the same year, and Aladdin Records released &quot;Battle of the Blues&quot;, a duet with Wynonie Harris. Turner stayed with National until 1947, but none of his recordings were big sellers. In 1950, he recorded the song &quot;Still in the Dark&quot;, released by Freedom Records. Joe Turner also played at the Cavalcades of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles which was produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. on September 23, 1945, to a crowd of 15,000. Count Basie, the Honeydrippers, The Peters Sisters, Slim and Bam and Valaida Snow were also featured artists. Turner also performed alongside Dizzy Gillespie at the fourth annual Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, on September 12, 1948. Also on the program that day were Frankie Laine, The Sweethearts of Rhythm, The Honeydrippers, Little Miss Cornshucks, Jimmy Witherspoon, The Blenders, and The Sensations.

Turner was a significant figure in the development of rhythm and blues. According to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, Turner and Louis Jordan laid the foundation for R&amp;B in the 1940s, &quot;cutting one swinging rhythm &amp; blues masterpiece after another&quot;.

Turner made many albums with Johnson, Art Tatum, Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith, Sammy Price, and other jazz groups. He recorded for several record companies. He also performed with the Count Basie Orchestra. During his career, Turner was part of the transition from big bands to jump blues to rhythm and blues to rock and roll. He was a master of traditional blues verses, and at Kansas City jam sessions he could swap choruses with instrumental soloists for hours.

===Success during the 1950s===

In 1951, while performing with the Count Basie Orchestra at Harlem&#x27;s Apollo Theater as a replacement for Jimmy Rushing, he was spotted by Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun, who contracted him to their new recording company, Atlantic Records. Turner recorded a number of successes for them, including the blues standards, &quot;Chains of Love&quot; and &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot;. Many of his vocals are punctuated with shouts to the band members, as in &quot;Boogie Woogie Country Girl&quot; (&quot;That&#x27;s a good rockin&#x27; band!&quot;, &quot;Go ahead, man! Ow! That&#x27;s just what I need!&quot; ) and &quot;Honey Hush&quot; (he repeatedly sings, &quot;Hi-yo, Silver!&quot;, a famous command used by the Lone Ranger on his popular radio show, to his horse named Silver). Turner&#x27;s records reached the top of the rhythm-and-blues charts. Some of his songs were so risqué that some radio stations refused to play them, but they received much play on jukeboxes.

Turner had great success during 1954 with &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot;, which significantly boosted his career, turning him into a teenage favorite, and also helped to transform popular music. During the song, Turner yells at his woman to &quot;get outta that bed, wash yo&#x27; face an&#x27; hands&quot; and comments that she&#x27;s &quot;wearin&#x27; those dresses, the sun comes shinin&#x27; through! I can&#x27;t believe my eyes, all that mess belongs to you.&quot; He sang it on film for the 1955 theatrical feature &quot;Rhythm and Blues Revue&quot;.

Although the cover version of the song by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets, with the risqué lyrics partly omitted, was a greater sales success, many listeners sought out Turner&#x27;s version and were introduced thereby to rhythm and blues. Elvis Presley&#x27;s version of &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot; combined Turner&#x27;s lyrics with Haley&#x27;s arrangement, but was not a successful single.

&quot;The Chicken and the Hawk&quot;, &quot;Flip, Flop and Fly&quot;, &quot;Hide and Seek&quot;, &quot;Morning, Noon and Night&quot;, and &quot;Well All Right&quot; were successful recordings from this period. He performed on the television program &quot;Showtime at the Apollo&quot; and in the movie &quot;Shake Rattle &amp; Rock!&quot; (1956).

The song &quot;Corrine, Corrina&quot; was another great seller during 1956. In addition to the rock music songs, he released &quot;Boss of the Blues&quot; album in 1956. &quot;(I&#x27;m Gonna) Jump for Joy&quot;, his last hit, reached the US R&amp;B record chart on May 26, 1958.

He toured Australia in 1957 with Lee Gordon&#x27;s Big Show sharing the bill with Bill Haley and the Comets, LaVern Baker and Freddie Bell and the Bellboys.

===Awards===
He won the &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine award for male vocalist in 1945.

He won the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; award for best &quot;new&quot; vocalist of 1956.

===Returning to Jazz===

After a number of successes in popular music, Turner resumed singing with small jazz combos, recording numerous albums in that style during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1966, Bill Haley helped revive Turner&#x27;s career by lending him the Comets for a series of popular recordings for the Orfeón label in Mexico. 

During the 1960s and 1970s he resumed performing jazz and blues music, performing at many music festivals and recording for Norman Granz&#x27;s Pablo Records. He also worked with Axel Zwingenberger. Turner also participated in a &quot;Battle of the Blues&quot; with Wynonie Harris and T-Bone Walker.

In 1965, he toured in England with the trumpeter Buck Clayton and the trombonist Vic Dickenson, accompanied by Humphrey Lyttelton and his band. Part of a studio concert was televised by the BBC and later issued on DVD. A sound recording of a club appearance made during this tour is not thought of sufficient sound quality to justify commercial issue. He also toured Europe with Count Basie and his orchestra. He won the British &quot;Jazz Journal&quot; award as top male singer of 1965. 

In 1977, Turner recorded a cover version of Guitar Slim&#x27;s song &quot;The Things That I Used to Do&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter&quot;, for Spivey Records, with Lloyd Glenn on piano. 

Turner received top billing with Count Basie in the Kansas City jazz reunion movie &quot;The Last of the Blue Devils&quot; (1979), featuring Jay McShann, Jimmy Forrest, and other players from the city.

In 1983, two years before his death, Turner was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame. That same year, the album &quot;Blues Train&quot; was released by Muse Records; the album featured Turner with the band Roomful of Blues. 

Turner&#x27;s career endured from the barrooms of Kansas City in the 1920s (when at the age of twelve he performed with a pencilled moustache and his father&#x27;s hat) to European jazz festivals of the 1980s.

==Death and tributes==
Turner died of heart failure in November 1985, at the age of 74, in Inglewood, California, having suffered from effects of arthritis, a stroke and diabetes. His funeral included musical tributes from Etta James and Barbara Morrison. He was buried at Roosevelt Memorial Park in Gardena, California.

He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; music critic Robert Palmer wrote of &quot;his voice, pushing like a Count Basie solo, rich and grainy as a section of saxophones, which dominated the room with the sheer sumptuousness of its sound.&quot; In announcing Turner&#x27;s death, the British music magazine &quot;NME&quot;, in its December 1985 issue, described him as &quot;the grandfather of rock and roll&quot;.

According to the Blues Hall of Fame, Turner &quot;was a king of the jump blues genre, a boogie woogie belter, progenitor of rhythm &amp; blues and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, and a respected performer in jazz circles.

Dave Alvin wrote a song about an evening he spent with Turner, entitled &quot;Boss of the Blues&quot;, for his 2009 album, &quot;Dave Alvin and the Guilty Women&quot;. Alvin discussed the song in issue 59 of the &quot;Blasters Newsletter&quot;. Alvin later collaborated with his brother and former Blaster Phil Alvin on a second reunion album, &quot;Lost Time&quot;, released in 2015, containing four covers of songs by Turner, including &quot;Cherry Red&quot;, &quot;Wee Baby Blues&quot; and &quot;Hide and Seek&quot;. The brothers met Turner in Los Angeles, where he was playing in clubs on Central Avenue and living in the Adams district between tours in the 1960s. Phil Alvin opened for Turner a few times with his first band, Delta Pacific. Turner continued mentoring the Alvin brothers until his death in 1985. He is pictured on the back cover of &quot;Lost Time&quot;.

The biographical film &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot; refers to Turner and his contemporaries Little Richard and Fats Domino as major influences on Holly, who is portrayed collecting their vinyl recordings.

A biography and discography, &quot;Big Joe Turner Feel So Fine&quot;, written by Derek Coller was published by Hardinge Simpole in 2023 ().

<doc id="90435" wikidata="Q14103" url="?curid=90435" title="Champagne-Ardenne">
<text>Champagne-Ardenne () is a former administrative region of France, located in the northeast of the country, bordering Belgium. Mostly corresponding to the historic province of Champagne, the region is known for its sparkling white wine of the same name.

==History==
The administrative region was formed in 1956, consisting of the four departments Aube, Ardennes, Haute-Marne, and Marne. On 1 January 2016, it merged with the neighboring regions of Alsace and Lorraine to form the new region Grand Est, thereby ceasing to exist as an independent entity.

==Geography==
Its rivers, most of which flow west, include the Seine, the Marne, and the Aisne. The Meuse flows north.
==Transportation==

===Highways===
* A4 connecting Paris and Strasbourg and serving the Reims metropolitan area
* A5 connecting Paris and Dijon and serving Troyes and Chaumont
* A26 connecting Calais and Troyes and serving Reims and Châlons-en-Champagne
* A34 connecting Reims and the Belgian border and serving Charleville-Mézières

===Rail===
The rail network includes the Paris–Strasbourg line, which follows the Marne Valley and serves Épernay, Châlons-en-Champagne, and Vitry-le-François. The LGV Est TGV line also connecting Paris and Strasbourg opened in 2007 and serves Reims with a train station in the commune of Bezannes.

===Water===
The region&#x27;s canals include the Canal latéral à la Marne and Marne-Rhine Canal, the latter connecting to the Marne at Vitry-le-François. These are &quot;petit gabarit&quot; canals.

===Air===
The Vatry International Airport, primarily dedicated to air freight, has a runway long. The airport is in a sparsely populated area just from Paris.

==Economy==

* 61.4% of its land is dedicated to agriculture
* 1st in France for the production of barley and alfalfa
* 2nd in France for the production of beets, onions, and peas
* 3rd in France for the production of tender wheat and rapeseed.
* 282.37 km2 of vineyards
* Champagne sales in 2001: 263 million bottles (4% increase from 2000) of which 37.6% were exported.
* 25% of French hosiery production
* 3rd metallurgic region in France

===Businesses===
* Verreries Mécaniques de Champagne
* Produits Métallurgiques à Reims
* Vallou

===Food processing===
* Champagne-Céréales
* France-Luzerne
* Béghin-Say

==Demographics==
The population of Champagne-Ardenne has been in steady decrease since 1982 due to a rural exodus. With 1.3 million people and a density of 52/km2, it is one of France&#x27;s least populated regions. After a brief period of stabilization in the 1990s, the region&#x27;s population is now among the fastest &quot;dying&quot; in Europe, with several municipalities losing people at a faster rate than many Eastern European areas, especially in the department of Haute-Marne. The region is among the oldest in France, has a weak fertility rate, and its immigrant population is minimal compared to the national average.

<text>Zea is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family. The best-known species is &quot;Z. mays&quot; (variously called maize, corn, or Indian corn), one of the most important crops for human societies throughout much of the world. The four wild species are commonly known as teosintes and are native to Mesoamerica.

==Etymology==
&quot;Zea&quot; is derived from the Greek name () for another cereal grain (possibly spelt).

==Recognized species==

The five accepted species names in the genus are: 
Maize (&quot;Zea mays&quot;) is further divided into four subspecies: &quot;Z. m. huehuetenangensis&quot;, &quot;Z. m. mexicana&quot;, &quot;Z. m. parviglumis&quot; (Balsas teosinte, the ancestor of maize), and &quot;Z. m. mays&quot;. The first three subspecies are teosintes; the last is maize, or corn, the only domesticated taxon in the genus &quot;Zea&quot;.

The genus is divided into two sections: &quot;Luxuriantes&quot;, with &quot;Z. diploperennis&quot;, &quot;Z. luxurians&quot;, &quot;Z. nicaraguensis&quot;, &quot;Z. perennis&quot;; and &quot;Zea&quot; with &quot;Z. mays&quot;. The former section is typified by dark-staining knobs made up of heterochromatin that are terminal on most chromosome arms, while most subspecies of section &quot;Zea&quot; may have none to three knobs between each chromosome end and the centromere and very few terminal knobs (except &quot;Z. m. huehuetenangensis&quot;, which has many large terminal knobs).

==Description==
Both annual and perennial teosinte species occur. &quot;Z. diploperennis&quot; and &quot;Z. perennis&quot; are perennial, while all other species are annual. All species are diploid (n=10) with the exception of &quot;Z. perennis&quot;, which is tetraploid (n=20). The different species and subspecies of teosinte can be readily distinguished based on morphological, cytogenetic, protein, and DNA differences and on geographic origin. The two perennials are sympatric and very similar and some consider them to be one species. What many consider to be the most puzzling teosinte is &quot;Z. m. huehuetenangensis&quot;, which combines a morphology rather like &quot;Z. m. parviglumis&quot; with many terminal chromosome knobs and an isozyme position between the two sections. Considered to be phenotypically the most distinctive, as well as the most threatened, teosinte is &quot;Zea nicaraguensis&quot;. This teosinte thrives in flooded conditions along 200 m of a coastal estuarine river in northwest Nicaragua.

Teosintes strongly resemble maize in many ways, notably their tassel (male inflorescence) morphology. Teosintes are distinguished from maize most obviously by their numerous branches each bearing bunches of distinctive, small female inflorescences. These spikes mature to form a two-ranked &#x27;ear&#x27; of five to 10 triangular or trapezoidal, black or brown disarticulating segments, each with one seed. Each seed is enclosed by a very hard fruitcase, consisting of a cupule or depression in the rachis and a tough lower glume. This protects them from the digestive processes of ruminants that forage on teosinte and aid in seed distribution through their droppings. Teosinte seed exhibits some resistance to germination, but will quickly germinate if treated with a dilute solution of hydrogen peroxide.

==Origin of maize and interaction with teosintes==

Maize is a grass, related to sorghum and more distantly to rice and wheat. The genus &quot;Zea&quot; is closely related to &quot;Tripsacum&quot;, gamagrass.

Teosintes are critical components of maize domestication, but opinions vary about which taxa were involved. According to the most widely held evolutionary model, the crop was derived directly from &quot;Z. m. parviglumis&quot; by selection of key mutations; but in some varieties up to 20% of its genetic material came from &quot;Z. m. mexicana&quot; through introgression.

All but the Nicaraguan species of teosinte may grow in or very near corn fields, providing opportunities for introgression between teosinte and maize. First, and later-generation hybrids are often found in the fields, but the rate of gene exchange is quite low. Some populations of &quot;Z. m. mexicana&quot; display Vavilovian mimicry within cultivated maize fields, having evolved a maize-like form as a result of the farmers&#x27; selective weeding pressure. In some areas of Mexico, teosintes are regarded by maize farmers as a noxious weed, while in a few areas, farmers regard it as a beneficial companion plant, and encourage its introgression into their maize.

===Early dispersal of maize in the Americas===

According to Matsuoka et al., the available early maize gene pool can be divided into three clusters:
* An Andean group, that includes the hand-grenade-shaped ear types and some other Andean maize (35 plants);
* All other South American and Mexican maize (80 plants);
* U.S. maize (40 plants)

Also, some other intermediate genomes, or admixtures of these clusters occur.

According to these authors, &quot;The maize of the Andes Mountains with its distinctive hand grenade-shaped ears was derived from the maize of lowland South America, which in turn came from maize of the lowlands of Guatemala and southern Mexico.&quot;

==Ecology==
&quot;Zea&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae (caterpillars) of some Lepidopteran species including (in the Americas) the fall armyworm (&quot;Spodoptera frugiperda&quot;), the corn earworm (&quot;Helicoverpa zea&quot;), and the stem borers &quot;Diatraea&quot; and &quot;Chilo&quot;; in the Old World, it is attacked by the double-striped pug, the cutworms heart and club and heart and dart, &quot;Hypercompe indecisa&quot;, the rustic shoulder-knot, the setaceous Hebrew character and turnip moths, and the European corn borer (&quot;Ostrinia nubilalis&quot;), among many others.

Virtually all populations of teosintes are either threatened or endangered: &quot;Z. diploperennis&quot; exists in an area of only a few square miles; &quot;Z. nicaraguensis&quot; survives as about 6000 plants in an area of 200 × 150 m. The Mexican and Nicaraguan governments have taken action in recent years to protect wild teosinte populations, using both &quot;in situ&quot; and &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation methods. Currently, a large amount of scientific interest exists in conferring beneficial teosinte traits, such as nitrogen fixation, insect resistance, perennialism, and flood tolerance, to cultivated maize lines, although this is very difficult due to linked deleterious teosinte traits.

==Genomics==
Gene flow from genetically modified maize to teosinte weeds has only been observed to produce a GM teosinte with the same trait but this may not always be the outcome. Teosinte with a different insertion of the transgene may result and functionally different outcomes may be produced.

<text>Pyrénées-Atlantiques (; Gascon Occitan: &quot;Pirenèus Atlantics&quot;; ) is a department located in the region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine in the southwest corner of metropolitan France. Named after the Pyrenees mountain range and the Atlantic Ocean, it covers the French Basque Country and the Béarn. It is divided in three arrondissements and its prefecture is Pau. In 2019, it had a population of 682,621.

==History==
Originally named Basses-Pyrénées, it was one of the 83 departments of France created during the French Revolution, on 4 March 1790. It comprised the territories of Labourd and Soule (in the provinces of Guyenne and Gascony), as well as Lower Navarre (still, at least nominally, part of the Kingdom of Navarre) and the Béarn. It was initially divided in six districts, with the prefecture at Navarrenx, before being moved to Pau on 14 October 1790.
The 1790 administrative reform brought about the end of native institutions and laws. All Basque estates representatives from Labourd overtly opposed the new administrative layout since it suppressed their institutions and laws. The representatives of Lower Navarre refused to vote in Paris arguing that they were not part of the Kingdom of France; those of Soule voted against. The brothers Garat, representing Labourd, eventually voted yes, thinking that it would give them a say in upcoming political decisions.

In 1800, during the Consulate, the six initial districts were replaced by five arrondissements: Pau, Orthez, Bayonne, Mauléon and Oloron.

In 1926, as part of a vast reform launched by the government of Raymond Poincaré, the arrondissements of Orthez and Mauléon were abolished, resulting in the three current arrondissements.

In the 1950s, the Basses-Pyrénées were one of the departments composing the newly created region of Aquitaine.

In 1969, the name of the department was changed to &quot;Pyrénées-Atlantiques&quot;, because the inhabitants of the department found the name of the Basses-Pyrénées pejorative compared to that of the Hautes-Pyrénées.

On January 1, 2016, the regions of Aquitaine, Poitou-Charentes and Limousin merged to form the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region.

==Geography==
The southernmost department of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, it is bordered by the departments of Landes, Hautes-Pyrénées and Gers (to the north, east and northeast, respectively), by the Bay of Biscay to the west and by the Spanish provinces of Huesca, Navarre and Gipuzkoa to the south. Lac Gentau is located in Pyrénées-Atlantiques, as are the Lacs de Carnau.d

The Pyrenees mountain range crosses the department from east to west from the Col d&#x27;Aubisque to the mouth of the Bidasoa at Hendaye. The border with Spain follows the Pyrenean chain.

The highest point is at the Pic Palas (commune of Laruns), in the Balaïtous massif, on the Franco-Spanish border, at 2,974 meters.

The summit of La Rhune (900 m) is particularly well-known because of its proximity to the coast (about ten kilometers) and its ancient tourist tradition.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Pau, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 11 communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants:

==Demographics==
There does not seem to be a particular name to designate the inhabitants of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques. The western part is mainly inhabited by the Basques and the eastern part by the Béarnais, who since the Revolution and the creation of the department have shared the same department. However, from 1790 to 1969, the inhabitants were called &quot;Bas-Pyrénéens&quot;. The Pyrénées-Atlantiques have a fertility rate below the French average with 1.7 children per woman.

Population development since 1801:
==Economy==
===Urban areas===
Pyrénées-Atlantiques, a border department, has cultivated a number of economic and cultural links with Spain.

Two urban concentrations exist in the east and west of the department: Pau, which has 145,000 inhabitants and 344,000 workers in the local area; and Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz which has 166,400 inhabitants and 235,000 workers in the local area.

===Tourism===
The department is known for its tourism industry:
==Culture==
The parts of the department that were part of Guyenne and Gascony, as well as Béarn, have a culture heavily influenced by the Basques, but clearly different identities.

Both the Gascon Bearnese variant and Basque language are indigenous to the region in their respective districts. Gascon in turn is a dialect of Occitan, formerly the main language of southern France. It is more closely related to Catalan than it is to French. Basque is a language isolate, not related to any known language. Today, French, the sole official language of the French Republic, is the predominant native language and is spoken by virtually all inhabitants.

Pyrénées-Atlantiques is also home to a number of professional sports teams, including rugby union football clubs Aviron Bayonnais, Biarritz Olympique and Section Paloise; basketball club Élan Béarnais Pau-Orthez; and association football club Pau FC.

The Pau Grand Prix, an auto race first held in 1901, has hosted the World Touring Car Championship, British Formula Three, Formula 3 Euro Series and FIA European Formula 3 Championship.

==Politics==

Pyrénées-Atlantiques is a stronghold of the centrist Democratic Movement (MoDem). Its founder and president, François Bayrou, has served as Mayor of Pau since 2014.

===Departmental politics===
The Departmental Council of Pyrénées-Atlantiques has 54 seats. Its president has been Jean-Jacques Lasserre of the Democratic Movement since 2015.

===National representation===
In the 2024 legislative election, Pyrénées-Atlantiques elected the following members of the National Assembly:

In the Senate, the department is represented by three members: Frédérique Espagnac (since 2011), Max Brisson (since 2017) and Denise Saint-Pé (since 2017).

==Heraldry==

The coat of arms of Pyrénées-Atlantiques combines those of four traditional provinces:

# Lower Navarre
# Béarn
# Labourd
# Soule

==Twinning and cooperation==
Pyrénées-Atlantiques is twinned with:
* Misiones Province, Argentina (since 2012)

<doc id="90444" wikidata="Q105285" url="?curid=90444" title="House of York">
<text>The House of York was a cadet branch of the English royal House of Plantagenet. Three of its members became kings of England in the late 15th century. The House of York descended in the male line from Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, the fourth surviving son of Edward III. In time, it also represented Edward III&#x27;s senior line, when an heir of York married the heiress-descendant of Lionel, Duke of Clarence, Edward III&#x27;s second surviving son. It is based on these descents that they claimed the English crown. Compared with its rival, the House of Lancaster, it had a superior claim to the throne of England according to cognatic primogeniture, but an inferior claim according to agnatic primogeniture. The reign of this dynasty ended with the death of Richard III of England at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. It became extinct in the male line with the death of Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick, in 1499.

== Descent from Edward III ==

The fourth surviving legitimate son of Edward III and Philippa of Hainault, Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, was created earl of Cambridge in 1362 and the first duke of York in 1385. Edmund&#x27;s first marriage was to Isabella of Castile, Duchess of York, daughter of Peter of Castile and María de Padilla, and sister of Constance of Castile, second wife of Edmund&#x27;s older brother John of Gaunt. Through this marriage Edmund had two sons, Edward, 2nd duke of York and the younger Richard of Conisburgh. His second marriage was to Joan Holland, whose sister Alianore Holland was mother to Anne Mortimer, the great-great-granddaughter of Edward III via Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, second surviving son of Edward III, and the elder brother of John of Gaunt. Richard of Conisburgh married Anne Mortimer, the marriage producing two children, Isabel of Cambridge and Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York. It was through Anne Mortimer&#x27;s lineage that the Yorkists derived their main claim to the throne.

Following Edmund of Langley&#x27;s death in 1402, his son Edward succeeded to the dukedom but had no issue before he was killed at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. His other son Richard had been executed for treason earlier in the same year following his involvement in the Southampton Plot to depose Henry V in favour of Edmund Mortimer, Richard&#x27;s brother-in-law. The dukedom therefore passed to Richard&#x27;s son, who became Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York. Being descended from Edward III in both the maternal and the paternal line gave Richard a significant claim to the throne if the Lancastrian line should fail, and by cognatic primogeniture arguably a superior claim. He emphasised the point by being the first to assume the Plantagenet surname in 1448. Having inherited the March and Ulster titles, he became the wealthiest and most powerful noble in England, second only to the king himself. Richard married Cecily Neville, a granddaughter of John of Gaunt, and had thirteen or possibly fifteen children:

* Anne of York (1439–1476)(Mitochondrial DNA taken from a descendant of her second daughter, Anne St Leger, Baroness de Ros, was used in the identification of the remains of Richard III, which were found in 2012.)
* Henry (b. 1441; died as a child)
* Edward (1442–1483)
* Edmund (1443–1460)
* Elizabeth (1444–1503)married John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk; she was the mother of several claimants to the throne.
* Margaret (1446–1503)married Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy.
* William (b. 1447; died as a child)
* John (b. 1448; died as a child)
* George (1449–1478)
* Thomas (b. 1450/51; died as a child)
* Richard (1452–1485)
* Ursula (b. 1455; died as a child)
* In her will, Cecily stated that Katherine and Humphrey were her children, but they may have been her grandchildren through de la Pole.

== Wars of the Roses ==

Despite his elevated status, Richard Plantagenet was denied a position in government by the advisers of the weak Henry VI, particularly John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset, and the queen consort, Margaret of Anjou. Although he served as protector of the realm during Henry VI&#x27;s period of incapacity in 1453–54, his reforms were reversed by Somerset&#x27;s party once the king had recovered.

The Wars of the Roses began the following year, with the First Battle of St Albans. Initially, Richard aimed only to purge his Lancastrian political opponents from positions of influence over the king. It was not until October 1460 that he claimed the throne for the House of York. In that year the Yorkists had captured the king at the battle of Northampton, but victory was short-lived. Richard and his second son Edmund were killed at the battle of Wakefield on 30 December.

Richard&#x27;s claim to the throne was inherited by his son Edward. With the support of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (&quot;The Kingmaker&quot;), Edward, already showing great promise as a leader of men, defeated the Lancastrians in a succession of battles. While Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou were campaigning in the north, Warwick gained control of the capital and had Edward declared king in London in 1461. Edward strengthened his claim with a decisive victory at the Battle of Towton in the same year, in the course of which the Lancastrian army was virtually wiped out.

== Reigns of the Yorkist Kings ==

The early reign of Edward IV was marred by Lancastrian plotting and uprisings in favour of Henry VI. Warwick himself changed sides, and supported Margaret of Anjou and the king&#x27;s jealous brother George, Duke of Clarence, in briefly restoring Henry in 1470–71. However, Edward regained his throne, and the House of Lancaster was wiped out with the death of Henry VI himself, in the Tower of London in 1471. In 1478, the continued trouble caused by Clarence led to his execution in the Tower of London; popularly he is thought to have been drowned in a butt of malmsey wine.

On Edward&#x27;s death in 1483, the crown passed to his twelve-year-old son Edward V. Edward IV&#x27;s younger brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was appointed Protector, and the young king, and his brother Richard, were accommodated into the Tower of London. The famous Princes in the Tower&#x27;s fate remains a mystery. As today it is unknown whether they were killed or who might have killed them. Parliament declared, in the document &quot;Titulus Regius&quot;, that the two boys were illegitimate, on the grounds that Edward IV&#x27;s marriage was invalid, and as such Richard was heir to the throne. He was crowned Richard III in July 1483.

== Defeat of the House of York ==

Though the House of Lancaster&#x27;s claimants were now the Royal Houses of Portugal and Castile through the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s two legitimate daughters, who had married into those houses, Henry Tudor, a descendant of the Beauforts, a legitimized branch of the House of Lancaster put forward his claim. Furthermore, some Edwardian loyalists were undeniably opposed to Richard, dividing his Yorkist power base. A coup attempt failed in late 1483, but in 1485 Richard met Henry Tudor at the battle of Bosworth Field. During the battle, some of Richard&#x27;s important supporters switched sides or withheld their retainers from the field. Richard himself was killed. He was the last of the Plantagenet kings, as well as the last English king to die in battle.

Henry Tudor declared himself king, took Elizabeth of York, eldest child of Edward IV, as his wife, claiming to have united the surviving houses of York and Lancaster, and acceded to the throne as Henry VII, founder of the Tudor dynasty which reigned until 1603.

===Later claimants===
At the point Henry VII of England seized the throne there were eighteen Plantagenet descendants who might today be thought to have a stronger hereditary claim. By 1510 this number increased with the birth of sixteen Yorkist children. However, Henry VII married Elizabeth of York the eldest daughter of Edward IV. This made their children his cognatic heirs. Margaret of York, Duchess of BurgundyEdward&#x27;s sister and Elizabeth&#x27;s auntand members of the de la Pole familychildren of Edward&#x27;s sister Elizabeth and John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk continued in attempts to restore a Yorkist line. Margaret&#x27;s nephew Edward, Earl of Warwick, the son of her brother George, was imprisoned in the Tower of London, but in 1487 Margaret financed a rebellion led by Lambert Simnel pretending to be Warwick, or &quot;Edward VI&quot;. John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln, joined the revolt and was killed in the suppression of the uprising at the Battle of Stoke Field in 1487. Warwick was implicated in further failed invasions supported by Margaret by Perkin Warbeck claiming to be Edward IV&#x27;s son Richard of Shrewsbury and executed on 28 November 1499. With this both the houses of Plantagenet and York went extinct in the legitimate male line.

<doc id="90446" wikidata="Q842346" url="?curid=90446" title="Equality (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, equality is a relationship between two quantities or expressions, stating that they have the same value, or represent the same mathematical object. Equality between and is written , and pronounced &quot; equals &quot;. In this equality, and are distinguished by calling them &quot;left-hand side&quot; (&quot;LHS&quot;), and &quot;right-hand side&quot; (&quot;RHS&quot;). Two objects that are not equal are said to be distinct.

Equality is often considered a kind of primitive notion, meaning, it is not formally defined, but rather informally said to be &quot;a relation each thing bears to itself and nothing else&quot;. This characterization is notably circular (&quot;nothing &quot;else&quot;). This makes equality a somewhat slippery idea to pin down.

Basic properties about equality like reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity have been understood intuitively since at least the ancient Greeks, but weren&#x27;t symbolically stated as general properties of relations until the late 19th century by Giuseppe Peano. Other properties like substitution and function application weren&#x27;t formally stated until the development of symbolic logic.

There are generally two ways that equality is formalized in mathematics: through logic or through set theory. In logic, equality is a primitive predicate (a statement that may have free variables) with the reflexive property (called the Law of identity), and the substitution property. From those, one can derive the rest of the properties usually needed for equality. Logic also defines the principle of extensionality, which defines two objects of a certain kind to be equal if they satisfy the same external property (See the example of sets below).

After the foundational crisis in mathematics at the turn of the 20th century, set theory (specifically Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory) became the most common foundation of mathematics in order to resolve the crisis. In set theory, any two sets are defined to be equal if they have all the same members. This is called the Axiom of extensionality. Usually set theory is defined within logic, and therefore uses the equality described above, however, if a logic system does not have equality, it is possible to define equality within set theory.

==Etymology==

In English, the word &quot;equal&quot; is derived from the Latin (&#x27;like&#x27;, &#x27;comparable&#x27;, &#x27;similar&#x27;), which itself stems from (&#x27;level&#x27;, &#x27;just&#x27;). The word entered Middle English around the 14th century, borrowed from Old French (modern ). More generally, the interlingual synonyms of &quot;equal&quot; have been used more broadly throughout history (see ).

Before the 16th century, there was no common symbol for equality, and equality was usually expressed with a word, such as &quot;aequales, aequantur, esgale, faciunt, ghelijck,&quot; or &quot;gleich,&quot; and sometimes by the abbreviated form &quot;aeq&quot;, or simply and . Diophantus&#x27;s use of , short for ( &#x27;equals&#x27;), in &quot;Arithmetica&quot; () is considered one of the first uses of an equals sign.

The sign , now universally accepted in mathematics for equality, was first recorded by Welsh mathematician Robert Recorde in &quot;The Whetstone of Witte&quot; (1557). The original form of the symbol was much wider than the present form. In his book, Recorde explains his design of the &quot;Gemowe lines&quot;, from the Latin (&#x27;twin&#x27;), using two parallel lines to represent equality because he believed that &quot;no two things could be more equal.&quot; 

Recorde&#x27;s symbol was not immediately popular. After its introduction, it wasn&#x27;t used again in print until 1618 (61 years later), in an anonymous Appendix in Edward Wright&#x27;s English translation of &quot;Descriptio&quot;, by John Napier. It wasn&#x27;t until 1631 that it received more than general recognition in England, being adopted as the symbol for equality in a few influential works. Later used by several influential mathematicians, most notably, both Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibnitz, and due to the prevalence of calculus at the time, it quickly spread throughout the rest of Europe.

== Basic properties ==
; Reflexivity
:: For every , one has .
; Symmetry
:: For every and , if , then .
; Transitivity
:: For every , , and , if and , then .
; Substitution
:: Informally, this just means that if , then can replace in any mathematical expression or formula without changing its meaning. (For a formal explanation, see ) For example:
; Operation application
:: For every and , with some operation formula_1, if , then formula_2. For example:
The first three properties are generally attributed to Giuseppe Peano for being the first to explicitly state these as fundamental properties of equality in his &#x27; (1889). However, the basic notions have always existed; for example, in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; (), he includes &#x27;common notions&#x27;: &quot;Things that are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another&quot; (transitivity), &quot;Things that coincide with one another are equal to one another&quot; (reflexivity), along with some operation-application properties for addition and subtraction. The operation-application property was also stated in Peano&#x27;s &#x27;, however, it had been common practice in algebra since at least Diophantus (). The substitution property is generally attributed to Gottfried Leibniz ().

==Equations==
An equation is a symbolic equality of two mathematical expressions connected with an equals sign (=). Algebra is the branch of mathematics concerned with equation solving: the problem of finding values of some variable, called , for which the specified equality is true. Each value of the unknown for which the equation holds is called a of the given equation; also stated as the equation. For example, the equation formula_3 has the values formula_4 and formula_5 as its only solutions. The terminology is used similarly for equations with several unknowns. The set of solutions to an equation or system of equations is called its solution set. For example, the set of all solution pairs formula_6 of the equation formula_7 forms the unit circle in analytic geometry; therefore, this equation is called .

In mathematical logic and computer science, an equation may described as a binary formula or Boolean-valued expression, which may be true for some values of the variables (if any) and false for other values. More specifically, an equation represents a binary relation (i.e., a two-argument predicate) which may produce a truth value (&quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;) from its arguments. In computer programming, the computation from the two expressions is known as comparison.

=== Identities ===
An identity is an equality that is true for all values of its variables in a given domain. An &quot;equation&quot; may sometimes mean an identity, but more often than not, it a subset of the variable space to be the subset where the equation is true. An example is formula_8, which is true for each real number formula_9. There is no standard notation that distinguishes an equation from an identity, or other use of the equality relation: one has to guess an appropriate interpretation from the semantics of expressions and the context. Sometimes, but not always, an identity is written with a triple bar: formula_10 This notation was introduced by Bernhard Riemann in his 1857 &quot;Elliptische Funktionen&quot; lectures (published in 1899). 

Alternatively, identities may be viewed as an equality of functions, where instead of writing formula_11, one may simply write formula_12. This is called the extensionality of functions. Viewed like this, the operation-application property still applies, but here, the operations are operators on a function space (a function acting on functions) like composition and the derivative, or functionals like function evaluation or the integral.

=== Definitions ===
Equations are often used to introduce new terms or symbols for constants, assert equalities, and introduce shorthand for complex expressions, which is called &quot;equal by definition&quot;, and often denoted with (formula_13). It is similar to the concept of assignment of a variable in computer science. For example, formula_14 defines Euler&#x27;s number, and formula_15 is the defining property of the imaginary number formula_16.

In mathematical logic, this is called an extension by definition (by equality) which is a conservative extension to a formal system. This is done by taking the equation defining the new constant symbol as a new axiom of the theory.

The first recorded symbolic use of &quot;Equal by definition&quot; appeared in &quot;Logica Matematica&quot; (1894) by Cesare Burali-Forti, an Italian mathematician. Burali-Forti, in his book, used the notation (formula_17).

=== History ===

Equality (or identity) is often considered a primitive notion, informally said to be &quot;a relation each thing bears to itself and to no other thing&quot;. This tradition can be traced back to at least 350 BC by Aristotle: in his &quot;Categories&quot;, he defines the notion of &quot;quantity&quot; in terms of a more primitive &quot;equality&quot; (distinct from identity or similarity), stating:
&quot;The most distinctive mark of quantity is that equality and inequality are predicated of it. Each of the aforesaid quantities is said to be equal or unequal. For instance, one solid is said to be equal or unequal to another; number, too, and time can have these terms applied to them, indeed can all those kinds of quantity that have been mentioned. That which is not a quantity can by no means, it would seem, be termed equal or unequal to anything else. One particular disposition or one particular quality, such as whiteness, is by no means compared with another in terms of equality and inequality but rather in terms of similarity. Thus it is the distinctive mark of quantity that it can be called equal and unequal.&quot; ― (Translated by E. M. Edghill)
Aristotle had separate categories for quantities (number, length, volume) and qualities (temperature, density, pressure), now called intensive and extensive properties. The Scholastics, particularly Richard Swineshead and other Oxford Calculators in the 14th century, began seriously thinking about kinematics and quantitative treatment of qualities, a major development in the quantification of physics, and which broadened the scope of mathematical objects beyond numbers and magnitudes.

Around the 19th century, with the growth of modern logic, it became necessary to have a more concrete description of equality. With the rise of predicate logic due to the work of Gottlob Frege, logic shifted from being focused on classes of objects to being property-based. This was followed by a movement for describing mathematics in logical foundations, called logicism. This trend lead to the axiomatization of equality through the law of identity and the substitution property especially in mathematical logic and analytic philosophy.

The precursor to the substitution property of equality was first formulated by Gottfried Leibniz in his &quot;Discourse on Metaphysics&quot; (1686), stating, roughly, that &quot;No two distinct things can have all properties in common.&quot; This has since broken into two principles, the substitution property (if formula_18, then any property of formula_9 is a property of formula_20), and its converse, the identity of indiscernibles (if formula_9 and formula_20 have all properties in common, then formula_18). Its introduction to logic, and first symbolic formulation is due to Bertrand Russell and Alfred Whitehead in their &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; (1910), who claim it follows from their axiom of reducibility, but credit Leibniz for the idea.

=== Axioms ===

&quot;Law of identity&quot;: Stating that each thing is identical with itself, without restriction. That is, for every formula_24, formula_25. It is the first of the traditional three laws of thought. Stated symbolically as:formula_26&quot;Substitution property&quot;: Sometimes referred to as &quot;Leibniz&#x27;s law&quot;, generally states that if two things are equal, then any property of one must be a property of the other. It can be stated formally as: for every and , and any formula formula_27 (with a free variable ), if formula_28, then formula_29 implies formula_30. Stated symbolically as:formula_31Function application is also sometimes included in the axioms of equality, but isn&#x27;t necessary as it can be deduced from the other two axioms, and similarly for symmetry and transitivity. (See )

In first-order logic, these are axiom schemas (usually, see below), each of which specify an infinite set of axioms. If a theory has a predicate that satisfies the Law of Identity and Substitution property, it is common to say that it &quot;has equality,&quot; or is &quot;a theory with equality.&quot; The use of &quot;equality&quot; here is a misnomer in that an arbitrary binary predicate that satisfies those properties may not be true equality, and there is no property or list of properties one could add to correct for this. If, however, one is given that a predicate is true equality, then those properties are enough, since if formula_9 has all the same properties as formula_20, and formula_9 has the property of being equal to formula_9, then formula_20 has the property of being equal to formula_9.

As axioms, one can deduce from the first using universal instantiation, and the from second, given formula_38 and formula_39, by using modus ponens twice. Alternatively, each of these may be included in logic as rules of inference. The first called &quot;equality introduction&quot;, and the second &quot;equality elimination&quot; (also called paramodulation), used by some theoretical computer scientists like John Alan Robinson in their work on resolution and automated theorem proving.

==== Objections ====
As mentioned above, these axioms don&#x27;t explicitly define equality, in the sense that we still don&#x27;t know if two objects are equal, only that &quot;if&quot; they&#x27;re equal, &quot;then&quot; they have the same properties. If these axioms were to define a &quot;complete axiomatization&quot; of equality, meaning, if they were to define equality, then the converse of the second statement must be true. This is because any reflexive relation satisfying the substitution property within a given theory would be considered an &quot;equality&quot; for that theory. The converse of the Substitution property is &quot;the identity of indiscernibles&quot;, which states that two distinct things cannot have all their properties in common. Stated symbolically as:

formula_40

In mathematics, the &quot;identity of indiscernibles&quot; is usually rejected since indiscernibles in mathematical logic are not necessarily forbidden. Outside of pure math, the &quot;identity of indiscernibles&quot; has attracted much controversy and criticism, especially from corpuscular philosophy and quantum mechanics.

===Derivations of basic properties===
* Reflexivity of Equality: Given some set with a relation induced by equality (formula_41), assume formula_42. Then formula_43 by the Law of identity, thus formula_44.
* Symmetry of Equality: Given some set with a relation induced by equality (formula_41), assume there are elements formula_46 such that formula_47. Then, take the formula formula_48. So we have formula_49. Since formula_28 by assumption, and formula_44 by Reflexivity, we have that formula_52.
* Transitivity of Equality: Given some set with a relation induced by equality (formula_41), assume there are elements formula_54 such that formula_47 and formula_56. Then take the formula formula_57. So we have formula_58. Since formula_59 by symmetry, and formula_56 by assumption, we have that formula_61.
* Function application: Given some function formula_1, assume there are elements and from its domain such that , then take the formula formula_63. So we have &lt;br&gt;formula_64 &lt;br&gt;Since formula_28 by assumption, and formula_66 by reflexivity, we have that formula_2.

== In set theory ==

Set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets, which can be informally described as &quot;collections of objects.&quot; Although objects of any kind can be collected into a set, set theory – as a branch of mathematics – is mostly concerned with those that are relevant to mathematics as a whole. 
Sets are uniquely characterized by their elements; this means that two sets that have precisely the same elements are equal (they are the same set). In a formalized set theory, this is usually defined by an axiom called the Axiom of extensionality.

For example, using set builder notation, 
:formula_68
Which states that &quot;The set of all integers greater than 0 but not more than 3 is equal to the set containing only 1, 2, and 3&quot;, despite the differences in notation.

José Ferreirós credits Richard Dedekind for being the first to explicitly state the principle, (although he does not assert it as a definition):
&quot;It very frequently happens that different things a, b, c ... considered for any reason under a common point of view, are collected together in the mind, and one then says that they form a system S; one calls the things a, b, c ... the elements of the system S, they are contained in S; conversely, S consists of these elements. Such a system S (or a collection, a manifold, a totality), as an object of our thought, is likewise a thing; it is completely determined when, for every thing, it is determined whether it is an element of S or not.&quot; ― Richard Dedekind, 1888 (Translated by José Ferreirós)

=== Background ===

Around the turn of the 20th century, mathematics faced several paradoxes and counter-intuitive results. For example, Russell&#x27;s paradox showed a contradiction of naive set theory, it was shown that the parallel postulate cannot be proved, the existence of mathematical objects that cannot be computed or explicitly described, and the existence of theorems of arithmetic that cannot be proved with Peano arithmetic. The result was a foundational crisis of mathematics.

The resolution of this crisis involved the rise of a new mathematical discipline called mathematical logic, which studies formal logic within mathematics. Subsequent discoveries in the 20th century then stabilized the foundations of mathematics into a coherent framework valid for all mathematics. This framework is based on a systematic use of axiomatic method and on set theory, specifically Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, developed by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel. This set theory (and set theory in general) is now considered the most common foundation of mathematics.

=== Extensionality ===
The term &quot;extensionality&quot;, as used in &quot;&#x27;Axiom of Extensionality&quot;&#x27; has its roots in logic. An intensional definition describes the necessary and sufficient conditions for a term to apply to an object. For example: &quot;An even number is an integer which is divisible by 2.&quot; An extensional definition instead lists all objects where the term applies. For example: &quot;An even number is any one of the following integers: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8..., -2, -4, -8...&quot; In logic, the extension of a predicate is the set of all things for which the predicate is true.

The logical term was introduced to set theory in 1893, Gottlob Frege attempted to use this idea of an extension formally in his &quot;Foundations of Arithmetic&quot;, where, if formula_69 is a predicate, its extension formula_70, is the set of all objects satisfying formula_69. For example if formula_72 is &quot;x is even&quot; then formula_70 is the set formula_74. In his work, he defined his infamous &quot;Basic Law V&quot; as:formula_75Stating that if two predicates have the same extensions (they are satisfied by the same set of objects) then they are logically equivalent, however, it was determined later that this axiom led to Russell&#x27;s paradox. The first explicit statement of the modern Axiom of Extensionality was in 1908 by Ernst Zermelo in a paper on the well-ordering theorem, where he presented the first axiomatic set theory, now called Zermelo set theory, which became the basis of modern set theories. The specific term for &quot;Extensionality&quot; used by Zermelo was &quot;Bestimmtheit&quot;.The specific English term &quot;extensionality&quot; only became common in mathematical and logical texts in the 1920s and 1930s, particularly with the formalization of logic and set theory by figures like Alfred Tarski and John von Neumann.

=== Set equality based on first-order logic with equality ===
In first-order logic with equality (See ), the axiom of extensionality states that two sets that &quot;contain&quot; the same elements are the same set.
* Logic axiom: formula_76
* Logic axiom: formula_77
* Set theory axiom: formula_78

The first two are given by the substitution property of equality from first-order logic; the last is a new axiom of the theory. Incorporating half of the work into the first-order logic may be regarded as a mere matter of convenience, as noted by Azriel Lévy.
: &quot;The reason why we take up first-order predicate calculus &quot;with equality&quot; is a matter of convenience; by this, we save the labor of defining equality and proving all its properties; this burden is now assumed by the logic.&quot;

=== Set equality based on first-order logic without equality ===
In first-order logic without equality, two sets are &quot;defined&quot; to be equal if they contain the same elements. Then the axiom of extensionality states that two equal sets &quot;are contained in&quot; the same sets.
* Set theory definition: formula_79
* Set theory axiom: formula_77
Or, equivalently, one may choose to define equality in a way that mimics, the substitution property explicitly, as the conjunction of all atomic formuals:

* Set theory definition: formula_81formula_82formula_83
* Set theory axiom: formula_78

In either case, the Axiom of Extensionality based on first-order logic without equality states:

* formula_85

=== Proof of basic properties ===

* Reflexivity: Given a set formula_86, assume formula_87, it follows trivially that formula_87, and the same follows in reverse, therefore formula_89 , thus formula_90.
* Symmetry: Given sets formula_91, such that formula_92, then formula_93, which implies formula_94, thus formula_95.
* Transitivity: Given sets formula_96, such that (1) formula_97 and (2) formula_98, assume formula_87, then formula_100 by (1), which implies formula_101 by (2), and similarly for the reverse, therefore formula_102, thus formula_103.
* Function application: Given formula_38 and formula_105, then formula_106. It can be proven that formula_107, using Kuratowski&#x27;s definition: formula_108 Then, since formula_109 by the Axiom of Extensionality, they must belong to the same sets, so, since formula_110 we have formula_111 or formula_112 Thus formula_113

== Similar relations ==

=== Approximate equality ===
Numerical approximation is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation (as opposed to symbolic manipulations) for the problems of mathematical analysis.

Calculations are likely to involve rounding errors and other approximation errors. Log tables, slide rules, and calculators produce approximate answers to all but the simplest calculations. The results of computer calculations are normally an approximation, expressed in a limited number of significant digits, although they can be programmed to produce more precise results.

If viewed as a binary relation, (denoted by the symbol formula_114) between real numbers or other things, if precisely defined, is not an equivalence relation since it&#x27;s not transitive, even if modeled as a fuzzy relation.

In computer science, equality is given by some relational operator. Real numbers are often approximated by floating-point numbers (A sequence of some fixed number of digits of a given base, scaled by an integer exponent of that base), thus it is common to store an expression that denotes the real number as to not lose precision. However, the equality of two real numbers given by an expression is known to be undecidable (specifically, real numbers defined by expressions involving the integers, the basic arithmetic operations, the logarithm and the exponential function). In other words, there cannot exist any algorithm for deciding such an equality (see Richardson&#x27;s theorem).

A questionable equality under test may be denoted using the formula_115 symbol.

=== Equivalence relation ===
An equivalence relation is a mathematical relation that generalizes the idea of similarity or sameness. It is defined on a set formula_86 as a binary relation formula_117 that satisfies the three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. Reflexivity means that every element in formula_86 is equivalent to itself (formula_119 for all formula_120). Symmetry requires that if one element is equivalent to another, the reverse also holds (formula_121). Transitivity ensures that if one element is equivalent to a second, and the second to a third, then the first is equivalent to the third (formula_122 and formula_123). These properties are enough to partition a set into disjoint equivalence classes. Conversely, every partition defines an equivalence class.

The equivalence relation of equality is a special case, as, if restricted to a given set formula_124, it is the strictest possible equivalence relation on formula_124; specifically, equality partitions a set into equivalence classes consisting of all singleton sets. Other equivalence relations, while less restrictive, often generalize equality by identifying elements based on shared properties or transformations, such as congruence in modular arithmetic or similarity in geometry.

==== Congruence relation ====

In abstract algebra, a congruence relation extends the idea of an equivalence relation to include the operation-application property. That is, given a set formula_86, and a set of operations on formula_86, then a congruence relation formula_117 has the property that formula_129 for all operations formula_130 (here, written as unary to avoid cumbersome notation, but formula_130 may be of any arity). A congruence relation on an algebraic structure such as a group, ring, or module is an equivalence relation that respects the operations defined on that structure.

=== Isomorphism ===
In mathematics, especially in abstract algebra and category theory, it is common to deal with objects that already have some internal structure. An isomorphism describes a kind of structure-preserving correspondence between two objects, establishing them as essentially identical in their structure or properties.

More formally, an isomorphism is a bijective mapping (or morphism) formula_130 between two sets or structures formula_133 and formula_134 such that formula_130 and its inverse formula_136 preserve the operations, relations, or functions defined on those structures. This means that any operation or relation valid in formula_133 corresponds precisely to the operation or relation in formula_134 under the mapping. For example, in group theory, a group isomorphism formula_139 satisfies formula_140 for all elements formula_141, where formula_142 denotes the group operation.

When two objects or systems are isomorphic, they are considered indistinguishable in terms of their internal structure, even though their elements or representations may differ. For instance, all cyclic groups of order formula_143 are isomorphic to the integers, formula_144, with addition. Similarly, in linear algebra, two vector spaces are isomorphic if they have the same dimension, as there exists a linear bijection between their elements.

The concept of isomorphism extends to numerous branches of mathematics, including graph theory (graph isomorphism), topology (homeomorphism), and algebra (group and ring isomorpisms), among others. Isomorphisms facilitate the classification of mathematical entities and enable the transfer of results and techniques between similar systems. Bridging the gap between isomorphism and equality was one motivation for the development of category theory, as well as for homotopy type theory and univalent foundations.

=== Geometry ===

In geometry, formally, two figures are equal if they contain exactly the same points. However, historically, geometric-equality has always been taken to be much broader. Euclid and Archimedes used &quot;equal&quot; (ἴσος isos) often referring to figures with the same area or those that could be cut and rearranged to form one another. For example, Euclid stated the Pythagorean theorem as “the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the squares on the sides, taken together”; and Archimedes said that “a circle is equal to the rectangle whose sides are the radius and half the circumference.”

This notion persisted until Adrien-Marie Legendre, who introduced the term &quot;equivalent&quot; to describe figures of equal area and restricted &quot;equal&quot; to what we now call “congruent”—the same shape and size, or if one has the same shape and size as the mirror image of the other. Euclid&#x27;s terminology continued in the work of David Hilbert in his &quot;Grundlagen der Geometrie&quot;, who further refined Euclid&#x27;s ideas by introducing the notions of polygons being &quot;divisibly equal&quot; (&quot;zerlegungsgleich&quot;) if they can be cut into finitely many triangles which are congruent, and &quot;equal in content&quot; (&quot;inhaltsgleichheit&quot;) if one can add finitely many divisibly equal polygons to each such that the resulting polygons are divisibly equal.

After the rise of set theory, around the 1960s, there was a push for a reform in mathematics education called New Math, following Andrey Kolmogorov, who, in an effort to restructure Russian geometry courses, proposed presenting geometry through the lens of transformations and set theory. Since a figure was seen as a set of points, it could only be equal to itself, as a result of Kolmogorov, the term &quot;congruent&quot; became standard in schools for figures that were previously called &quot;equal&quot;, which popularized the term.

While Euclid addressed proportionality and figures of the same shape, it wasn’t until the 17th century that the concept of similarity was formalized in the modern sense. Similar figures are those that have the same shape but can differ in size; they can be transformed into one another by scaling and congruence. Later a concept of equality of directed line segments, equipollence, was advanced by Giusto Bellavitis in 1835.

<doc id="90447" wikidata="Q203229" url="?curid=90447" title="François-André Danican Philidor">
<text>François-André Danican Philidor (7 September 1726 – 31 August 1795), often referred to as André Danican Philidor during his lifetime, was a French composer and chess player. He contributed to the early development of the &quot;opéra comique&quot;. He is widely regarded as the best chess player of his age; his book &quot;Analyse du jeu des Échecs&quot; was considered a standard chess manual for at least a century. A well-known chess opening, an endgame position, and a checkmate method are all named after him.

==Musical family==
François-André Danican Philidor came from the well-known musical Philidor family. The original name of his family was Danican, but François-André&#x27;s grandfather, Jean Danican Philidor, was given the nickname of Philidor by Louis XIII because his oboe playing reminded the king of an Italian virtuoso oboist named Filidori.

==Music career==

Philidor joined the royal choir of Louis XV in 1732 at the age of 6, and made his first attempt at the composition of a song at the age of 11. It was said that Louis XV wanted to listen to the choir almost every day, and the singers, while waiting for the king to arrive, played chess to relieve their boredom; this may have sparked Philidor&#x27;s interest in chess.

Starting in about 1740, he lived and worked in Paris as a performer, teacher and music copyist. He was the teacher of the Bohemian composer and pianist Ludwig Wenzel Lachnith. During this time he met Diderot, who called him &#x27;Philidor le subtil&#x27; in &quot;Le neveu de Rameau&quot;. He spent much of the period 1745–1754 in London after a concert tour of the Netherlands collapsed, and moved in the same circles as Dr Johnson and Dr Burney. He returned to the French capital in 1754, resolving to devote himself seriously to musical composition, although his music was found by some to be too Italianate (as a result of his travels). However he scored several triumphs at the fair theatres, starting with &quot;Blaise le savetier&quot; in 1759. His three most successful works were &quot;Le sorcier&quot; (1764), &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (after Henry Fielding, 1765), and &quot;Ernelinde, princesse de Norvège&quot; (1767).

For a time Philidor was among the leading opera composers in France, and during his musical career produced over 20 &quot;opéras comiques&quot; and two &quot;tragédies lyriques&quot;. He also wrote secular cantatas and motets.

Philidor also wrote music for masonic rituals. The first performance of his &quot;Carmen Saeculare&quot; was performed at Freemasons&#x27; Hall in London in 1779. He was a member of the renowned Parisian Lodge &quot;Les Neuf Soeurs&quot;. This Lodge had an allied society for musicians, called the &quot;Société Apollonienne&quot;.

==Chess career==
Philidor started playing regularly around 1740 at the chess Mecca of France, the Café de la Régence. It was also there that he famously played with a friend from New England, Benjamin Franklin. The best player in France at the time, Legall de Kermeur, taught him. At first, Legall could give Philidor rook odds, a handicap in which the stronger player starts without one of his rooks, but in only three years, Philidor equaled and then surpassed him.

Philidor visited England in 1747 and decisively beat the Syrian Philipp Stamma in a match, although Philidor let Stamma have the first move in every game and scored all draws as wins for Stamma. The same year, Philidor played many games with another strong player, Sir Abraham Janssen, who was then the best player in England, and with the exception of Legall, probably the best player Philidor ever encountered. He could win on an average one game in four from Philidor at even terms, and Philidor himself declared that he could only give to Janssen one-pawn odds in exchange for making the first move with the white pieces.

In 1754, Philidor returned to France, after nine years of absence, spent mostly in the Netherlands and England. He was now a much stronger player, having successfully played opponents of the calibre of Philip Stamma and Abraham Janssen, but, as G. Allen reports in &quot;The life of Philidor&quot;, it was not until his match with Legall (also known as de Legal) in 1755 that he can be considered the strongest player in the world.
When Philidor left Paris, in 1745, although he had for some time been playing even games with M. de Legal ... he had not ceased to recognize his old master as still his master and superior. But nine years of practice, with a great variety of players, had authorized him to look for neither superior nor equal; and when, in 1755, a match was arranged between the pupil and his master, who was still at the height of his strength, the result placed the crown firmly and indisputably upon the head of Philidor.
In 1771 and 1773, Philidor briefly stayed in London to play at the Salopian coffee house, Charing Cross and at the St. James Chess Club. In 1774, Parloe&#x27;s chess club, on St. James Street in London, was created, and Philidor obtained remuneration as a chess master every year for a regular season from February to June. Philidor stayed faithful to this agreement until the end of his life, and he was replaced by Verdoni only after his death. Here, Philidor encountered George Atwood, a famous mathematician, physician and lecturer at Cambridge University. In an article by J. J. O&#x27;Connor and E. F. Robertson, devoted to George Atwood, there is the following passage: &quot;Atwood was a renowned amateur chess-player and among other opponents played games against the famous French player Philidor, who was regarded as the unofficial world champion.&quot;

Henry Bird records:

Of the players who encountered Philidor, Sir Abraham Janssens, who died in 1775, seems to have been the best. Atwood, one of Pitt&#x27;s secretaries, came next; he was of a class which we should call third or two grades of odds below Philidor, a high standard of excellence to which but few amateurs attained. One of the most interesting features of Atwood as a chess player is that he recorded and preserved some of his games, an unusual practice at that time. These records have survived, among them the last games that Philidor played, which were against Atwood at Parsloe&#x27;s Club in London on 20 June 1795.
In England, Philidor astounded his peers by playing three blindfold chess games simultaneously in the chess club of St. James Street on 9 May 1783. Philidor let all three opponents play white, and gave up a pawn to the third player. Some affidavits were signed, because those persons who were involved doubted that future generations would believe that such a feat was possible. Today, three simultaneous blindfold games would be fairly unremarkable among many chess masters. Even when he was 67 years old, he played and won two blindfold games simultaneously in London in 1793.

Philidor, both in England and France, was largely recognized in each of his fields and had a lot of admirers, protectors and friends, such as the French philosophers Voltaire, Rousseau and the famous English actor David Garrick (1717–1779).

In December 1792, however, when he was 65, Philidor was forced to leave France for England. He fled the French Revolution (1789–1799) because his name was on the Revolutionary banishment list, established by the &quot;Convention nationale&quot;. This was not probably due to his ideas (indeed it seems Philidor was rather reserved about his opinions apart from music and chess), but very likely in view of the traditional attachment of his family to the King&#x27;s family service.

Andrew Soltis writes that Philidor &quot;was the best player in the world for 50 years. In fact, he was probably about 200 rating points better than anyone else yet alive—set apart by the mysteries of the game he had solved.&quot;

Also interesting is GM Boris Alterman&#x27;s opinion on Philidor&#x27;s play:

Five hundred years ago, chess was different from today. Pawns didn&#x27;t cost as much as they do today. The best players started games with the gambits. Pawns were only a small price to: Open a file or diagonal; Create an immediate attack on an opponent&#x27;s king. It was the Italian style of chess. All positions of the King&#x27;s Gambit were very popular. ... The best chess player of his day was Francois Andre Danican-Philidor. ... His published chess strategy stood for a hundred years without significant addition or modification. He preached the value of a strong pawn center, an understanding of the relative value of the pieces, and correct pawn formations. ...
In the same article, Alterman also noticed, analyzing the game Count Brühl–Philidor, F, , London 1783, that Philidor understood very well modern concepts like the power of passed pawns, bad and good pieces, space advantage, open files, pawn structure and the importance of center.

Jacques François Mouret, one of the best French players of the early 19th century, was Philidor&#x27;s great-nephew.

===&quot;l&#x27;Analyse du jeu des Échecs&quot;===
In 1749, Philidor published his famous book &quot;Analyse du jeu des Échecs&quot;. He printed a second edition in 1777 and a third in 1790. The book was such an advance in chess knowledge that, by 1871, it had gone through about 70 editions and had been translated into English, Spanish, German, Russian and Italian. In it, Philidor analyzed nine different types of game openings. Most of the openings of Philidor are designed to strengthen and establish a strong defensive center using pawns. He is the first one to realize the new role of the pawn in the chess game, and his most famous advice was the saying &quot;The pawns are the soul of chess.&quot;
More precisely Philidor said:

Mon but principal est de me rendre recommandable par une nouveauté dont personne ne s&#x27;est avisé, ou peut-être n&#x27;a été capable; c&#x27;est celle de bien jouer les pions; ils sont l&#x27;âme des Echecs : ce sont eux-mêmes qui forment uniquement l&#x27;attaque et la défense et de leur bon ou mauvais arrangement dépend entièrement le gain ou la perte de la partie.
Translation: My main purpose is to gain recognition for myself by means of a new idea of which no one has conceived, or perhaps has been unable to practice; that is, good play of the pawns; they are the soul of chess: it is they alone that determine the attack and the defense, and the winning or losing of the game depends entirely on their good or bad arrangement.

He also included analysis of certain positions of rook and bishop versus rook, such analysis being still current theory even today. He demonstrated an important drawing technique with a rook and pawn versus rook endgame in what is known as the Philidor position. The Philidor Defense (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6) is named for him. Philidor&#x27;s book was the very first to give detailed annotations on how to play the middlegame, present chess strategy as a whole, and present the concepts of the blockade, prophylaxis, positional sacrifice and mobility of the pawn formation.

Early critics of the &quot;Analyse du jeu des Échecs&quot; include those of the Modenese School (Ercole del Rio, Lolli or Ponziani), who in contrast to the French, advocated a free piece play, gambit openings and tactical complications; they also found some of the variations reported in the &quot;Analyse&quot; to be unsound (in particular those related with ...f7–f5 push in the Philidor Defence: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 f5). Some of Philidor&#x27;s disciples—Bernard, Carlier, Leger, and Verdoni, who met at the Café de la Régence under the name of the &quot;Société des Amateurs&quot;—also criticized his work. In their book, &quot;Traité des Amateurs&quot;, they expressed many criticisms and comments on his earlier printed book, arguing that the variations reported in Philidor&#x27;s &quot;Analyse&quot; are more instructive than correct. Nevertheless, the games in the &quot;Traité&quot; can be regarded, together of those of Philidor, as typical examples of the understanding of chess during the Enlightenment, and the &quot;Société des Amateurs&quot; was much closer to Philidor than to the Modenese school.

=== Notable games ===
*Captain Smith vs. François André Philidor, London, England 1790, Bishop&#x27;s Opening: Berlin Defense (C24), . A good sample of Philidor&#x27;s ideas about pawns; plus a nice mating at the end.
*François André Philidor vs. , Unknown 1749, Bishop&#x27;s Opening: Boi Variation (C23), . This game—possibly a by Philidor—demonstrates the value of passed pawns.
*François André Philidor vs &quot;The Turk&quot;.

==Final years==
Philidor was stuck in England when the French Revolution occurred. Because of many of his social connections mentioned above, the Revolutionary Government put him on the banned list. He died on 31 August 1795 in London, and was buried in St James, Piccadilly. A few days later, his relatives succeeded in getting his name removed from the list.

==Chess topics named after him==
Philidor&#x27;s name is used for three well-known chess topics:
*The Philidor Defence, an opening he advocated;
*&quot;Philidor&#x27;s Legacy&quot;, a type of smothered mate (in fact discovered centuries before Philidor);
*Philidor&#x27;s position, several endgame positions.

==&quot;Battez Philidor!&quot;==
A one-act &quot;opéra-comique&quot; with music by Amédée Dutacq and libretto by Abraham Dreyfus entitled &quot;Battez Philidor !&quot; (&quot;Beat Philidor!&quot;) was premiered on 13 November 1882 at the Opéra-Comique. Set in 1777, a poor musician is required to beat Philidor at chess before he can win the hand of his sweetheart. Although Philidor agrees to lose the match to help out, by distraction he nonetheless wins the game, although all turns out well for the lovers in the end. &quot;Battez Philidor !&quot; also features Philidor&#x27;s sometime collaborator A A H Poinsinet.

<doc id="90448" wikidata="Q191594" url="?curid=90448" title="Fifth column">
<text>A fifth column is a group of people who undermine a larger group or nation from within, usually in favor of an enemy group or another nation. The activities of a fifth column can be overt or clandestine. Forces gathered in secret can mobilize openly to assist an external attack. The term is also applied to organized actions by military personnel. Clandestine fifth column activities can involve acts of sabotage, disinformation, espionage or terrorism executed within defense lines by secret sympathizers with an external force.

==History==
===Internal Enemy in Antiquity===
The distinction between internal and external enemies to a people or government was a topic of discussion in antiquity, mentioned most notably in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;.

===Origin of Modern Term===
The term &quot;fifth column&quot; originated in Spain (originally ) during the early phase of the Spanish Civil War. It gained popularity in the Republican faction media in early October 1936 and immediately started to spread abroad.

The exact origins of the term are not clear. Its first known appearance is in a secret telegram dated 30 September 1936, that was sent to Berlin by the German chargé d&#x27;affaires in Alicante, . In the telegram, he referred to an unidentified &quot;supposed statement by Franco&quot; that &quot;is being circulated&quot; (apparently in the Republican zone or in the Republican-held Levantine zone). This &quot;supposed statement&quot; held that Franco had claimed that there were four Nationalist columns approaching Madrid, and a fifth column waiting to attack from the inside. The telegram was part of the secret German diplomatic correspondence and was discovered long after the civil war.

The first identified public use of the term is in the 3 October 1936 issue of the Madrid Communist daily &quot;Mundo Obrero&quot;. In a front-page article, the party propagandist Dolores Ibárruri referred to a statement very similar (or identical) to the one that Völckers had referred to in his telegram, but attributed it to General Emilio Mola rather than to Franco. On the same day, the PCE activist Domingo Girón made a similar claim during a public rally. During the next few days, various Republican papers repeated the story, but with differing detail; some attributed the phrase to General Queipo de Llano, while later some Soviet propagandists would claim it was coined by General Varela. By mid-October, the media was already warning of the &quot;famous fifth column&quot;.

Historians have never identified the original statement referred to by Völckers, Ibárruri, Girón, de Jong, and others. The transcripts of Francisco Franco&#x27;s, Gonzalo Queipo de Llano&#x27;s, and Emilio Mola&#x27;s radio addresses have been published, but they do not contain the term, and no other original statement containing this phrase has ever surfaced. Australian journalist Noel Monks, who took part in Mola&#x27;s press conference on 28 October 1936, claimed that Mola referred to on that day, but by that time the term had already been in use in the Republican press for more than three weeks.

Historiographic works offer differing perspectives on authorship of the term. Many scholars have no doubt about Mola&#x27;s role and refer to &quot;fifth column&quot; as &quot;a term coined in 1936 by General Emilio Mola&quot;, though they acknowledge that his exact statement cannot be verified. In some sources, Mola is named as a person who had used the term during an impromptu press interview, and different—though detailed—versions of the exchange are offered. Probably the most popular version describes the theory of Mola&#x27;s authorship with a grade of doubt, either noting that it is presumed but has never been proven, or that the phrase &quot;is attributed&quot; to Mola, who &quot;apparently claimed&quot; so, or else noting that (the famous fifth column that General Mola seems to have referred to) Some authors consider it possible if not likely that the term has been invented by the Communist propaganda with the purpose of either raising morale or providing justification for terror and repression; initially it might have been part of the whispering campaign, but was later openly floated by Communist propagandists. There are also other theories afloat.

Some writers, mindful of the origin of the phrase, use it only in reference to military operations rather than the broader and less well-defined range of activities that sympathizers might engage in to support an anticipated attack.

===Second World War===
By the late 1930s, as American involvement in the war in Europe became more likely, the term &quot;fifth column&quot; was commonly used to warn of potential sedition and disloyalty within the borders of the United States. The fear of betrayal was heightened by the rapid fall of France in 1940, which some blamed on internal weakness and a pro-German &quot;fifth column&quot;. A series of photos run in the June 1940 issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine warned of &quot;signs of Nazi Fifth Column Everywhere&quot;. In a speech to the House of Commons that same month, Winston Churchill reassured MPs that &quot;Parliament has given us the powers to put down Fifth Column activities with a strong hand.&quot; In July 1940, &quot;Time&quot; magazine referred to talk of a fifth column as a &quot;national phenomenon&quot;.

In August 1940, &quot;The New York Times&quot; mentioned &quot;the first spasm of fear engendered by the success of fifth columns in less fortunate countries&quot;. One report identified participants in Nazi &quot;fifth columns&quot; as &quot;partisans of authoritarian government everywhere&quot;, citing Poland, Czechoslovakia, Norway, and the Netherlands. During the Nazi invasion of Norway, the head of the Norwegian fascist party, Vidkun Quisling, proclaimed the formation of a new fascist government in control of Norway, with himself as Prime Minister, by the end of the first day of fighting. The word &quot;quisling&quot; soon became a byword for &quot;collaborator&quot; or &quot;traitor&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; on 11 August 1940, featured three editorial cartoons using the term. John Langdon-Davies, a British journalist who covered the Spanish Civil War, wrote an account called &quot;The Fifth Column&quot; which was published the same year. In November 1940, Ralph Thomson, reviewing Harold Lavine&#x27;s &quot;Fifth Column in America&quot;, a study of Communist and fascist groups in the US, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, questioned his choice of that title: &quot;the phrase has been worked so hard that it no longer means much of anything&quot;.
Immediately following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, US Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox issued a statement that &quot;the most effective Fifth Column work of the entire war was done in Hawaii with the exception of Norway&quot;. In a column published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, dated 12 February 1942, the columnist Walter Lippmann wrote of imminent danger from actions that might be taken by Japanese Americans. Titled &quot;The Fifth Column on the Coast&quot;, he wrote of possible attacks that could be made along the West Coast of the United States that would amplify damage inflicted by a potential attack by Japanese naval and air forces. Suspicion about an active fifth column on the coast led eventually to the internment of Japanese Americans.

During the Japanese invasion of the Philippines, an article in the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; in December 1941 said the indigenous Moro Muslims were &quot;capable of dealing with Japanese fifth columnists and invaders alike&quot;. Another in the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; the following month alleged that the large population of Japanese immigrants in Davao in the Philippines welcomed the invasion: &quot;the first assault on Davao was aided by numbers of Fifth Columnists–residents of the town&quot;. However, postwar analysis of both Japanese and American military records, including the interrogation of surviving Japanese officers, fail to support the claims of a Japanese fifth column existing in the Philippines prior to the outbreak of hostilities.

===Later usage===
* German minority organizations in Czechoslovakia formed the Sudeten German Free Corps, which aided Nazi Germany. Some claimed they were &quot;self-defense formations&quot; created in the aftermath of World War I and unrelated to the German invasion two decades later. More often their origins were discounted and they were defined by the role they played in 1938–39: &quot;The same pattern was repeated in Czechoslovakia. Henlein&#x27;s Free Corps played in that country the part of fifth column&quot;.
* The United Front Work Department has been used by the Chinese government to influence elite individuals and organizations especially among Taiwanese and overseas Chinese communities around the world. UFWD has been accused of promoting pro-unification sentiment in Taiwan as well as election interference in some countries. On September 2024, Linda Sun, a staffer for New York governor Kathy Hochul was arrested for accusation of being a foreign agent due to her affiliation with UFWD affiliated organization that is Henan Association of Eastern America.
* In 1945, a document produced by the US Department of State compared the earlier efforts of Nazi Germany to mobilize the support of sympathizers in foreign nations to the superior efforts of the international communist movement at the end of World War II: &quot;a communist party was in fact a fifth column as much as any [German] Bund group, except that the latter were crude and ineffective in comparison with the Communists&quot;. Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., wrote in 1949: &quot;the special Soviet advantage—the warhead—lies in the fifth column; and the fifth column is based on the local Communist parties&quot;.
* In 1979, Saddam Hussein, the President of Iraq, orchestrated a purge of political dissidents within the Ba&#x27;ath Party. Hussein claimed that he had uncovered a fifth column within the organization and ordered Muhyi Abdul-Hussein Mashhadi to confess his alleged involvement and that of 68 other politicians, who were promptly arrested. Twenty-two of the arrested, including Mashhadi, were executed.
* Zainichi Koreans living in Japan, particularly those affiliated with the organization Chongryun (which is itself affiliated with the government of North Korea) are sometimes seen as a &quot;fifth column&quot; by some Japanese, and have been the victims of verbal and physical attacks. These have occurred more frequently since the government of Kim Jong Il acknowledged it had abducted Japanese citizens from Japan and tested ballistic missiles near the waters of and over mainland Japan.
* A significant number of Israeli Arabs, who compose approximately 20% of Israel&#x27;s population, identify more with the Palestinian cause than with the State of Israel or Zionism. As a result, many Israeli Jews, including politicians, rabbis, journalists, and historians, view them (and/or the main Israeli Arab political group, the Joint List) as a fifth column.
* Counter-jihad literature has sometimes portrayed Western Muslims as a &quot;fifth column&quot;, collectively seeking to destabilize Western nations&#x27; identity and values for the benefit of an international Islamic movement intent on the establishment of a caliphate in Western countries. Following the 2015 attack by French-born Muslims on the offices of &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; in Paris, the leader of the UK Independence Party Nigel Farage said that Europe had &quot;a fifth column living within our own countries&quot;. In 2001, Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn talked about Muslim immigrants being a &quot;fifth column&quot;, on the night he was dismissed as leader of Liveable Netherlands.

* In 2022, Russian president Vladimir Putin called Russian citizens who are against the Russian invasion of Ukraine as fifth columnists and &quot;national traitors&quot;.
* Members of the American and European far-right have been widely described as fifth columnists in light of Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election and presidency of Donald Trump and leading up to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. American conservative journalist Tucker Carlson, in particular, has faced allegations of fifth columnist behavior, especially after he decided to visit Russia and interview Vladimir Putin.
* In 2024, following claims that taxpayer funds were improperly given to the UNRWA due to family interests in Gaza during the Israel–Hamas war, Humza Yousaf, the First Minister of Scotland, revealed that he had been subjected to &quot;smears&quot; throughout his political life including allegations he was a &quot;fifth columnist&quot; because of his faith and race.

==In popular culture==
The title of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s only play &quot;The Fifth Column&quot; (1938) is a translation of General Mola&#x27;s phrase In early 1937, Hemingway had been in Madrid, reporting the war from the loyalist side, and helping make the film &quot;The Spanish Earth&quot;. He returned to the US to publicize the film and wrote the play, in the Hotel Florida in Madrid, on his next visit to Spain later that year.

In the US, an Australian radio play, &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, proved to be very popular, though this popularity was due to the belief that the stories of fifth column activities were based on real events. In December 1940, the Australian censors had the series banned.

British reviewers of Agatha Christie&#x27;s 1941 novel &quot;N or M?&quot; used the term to describe the plot&#x27;s depiction of two British turncoats working on behalf the German government in Britain during World War II.

In Frank Capra&#x27;s film &quot;Meet John Doe&quot; (1941), newspaper editor Henry Connell warns the politically naïve protagonist, John Doe, about a businessman&#x27;s plans to promote his own political ambitions using the apolitical John Doe Clubs. Connell says to John: &quot;Listen, pal, this fifth-column stuff is pretty rotten, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;, identifying the businessman with anti-democratic interests in the United States. When Doe agrees, he adds: &quot;And you&#x27;d feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn&#x27;t you?&quot;

In the film &quot;All Through the Night&quot; (1942), &quot;Gloves&quot; Donahue (Humphrey Bogart) tries to stop a secret nazi fifth column trying to sink a battleship in New York.

Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Saboteur&quot; (1942) features Robert Cummings asking for help against &quot;fifth columnists&quot; conspiring to sabotage the American war effort. The film was also released under the name &quot;Fifth Column&quot; in Dutch (), Finnish () and French (). Soon the term was being used in popular entertainment.

Several World War II–era animated shorts include the term. Cartoons of Porky Pig asked any &quot;fifth columnists&quot; in the audience to leave the theater immediately. In Looney Tunes&#x27; &quot;Foney Fables&quot;, the narrator of a comic fairy tale described a wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing as a &quot;fifth columnist&quot;. There was a Merrie Melodies cartoon released in 1943 titled &quot;The Fifth-Column Mouse.&quot; Comic books also contained references to the fifth column.

Graham Greene, in &quot;The Quiet American&quot; (1955), uses the phrase &quot;Fifth Column, Third Force, Seventh Day&quot; in the second chapter.

In the 1959 British action film &quot;Operation Amsterdam&quot;, the term &quot;fifth columnists&quot; is used repeatedly to refer to Nazi-sympathizing members of the Dutch Army.

The &quot;V&quot; franchise is a set of TV shows, novels and comics about an alien invasion of Earth. A group of aliens opposed to the invasion and assist the human Resistance Movement is called The Fifth Column.

In the episode &quot;Flight Into the Future&quot; from the 1960s TV show &quot;Lost In Space&quot;, Dr. Smith is referred to as the fifth columnist of the Jupiter 2 expedition. In the first episode, he was a secret agent sent to sabotage the mission who got caught on board at liftoff.

There is an American weekly news podcast called &quot;The Fifth Column&quot;, hosted by Kmele Foster, Matt Welch, Michael C. Moynihan, and Anthony Fisher.

Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1941 story &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;, originally titled &quot;Sixth Column&quot;, refers to a fictional fifth column that 
In &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot;, series 2 episode 3, &quot;War Games&quot;, one line reads: &quot;It&#x27;s the Second salvage collection I&#x27;ve missed, they&#x27;ve got me down as a fifth columnist.&quot;

In &quot;&quot;, a total conversion mod for the 2015 Bethesda Softworks action role-playing game &quot;Fallout 4&quot;, there is a populist faction known as the &quot;5th Column&quot; whose declared aim is to tear down the existing government and rebuild it. Their propaganda style and black uniforms are a likely reference to the British Union of Fascists, which was founded in 1932 by Sir Oswald Mosley and banned by the British government in 1940 after the start of World War II amid suspicion that its supporters might form a pro-Nazi &quot;fifth column&quot;.

<text>The Seminole Wars (also known as the Florida Wars) were a series of three military conflicts between the United States and the Seminoles that took place in Florida between about 1816 and 1858. The Seminoles are a Native American nation which coalesced in northern Florida during the early 1700s, when the territory was still a Spanish colonial possession. Tensions grew between the Seminoles and American settlers in the newly independent United States in the early 1800s, mainly because enslaved people regularly fled from Georgia into Spanish Florida, prompting slaveowners to conduct slave raids across the border. A series of cross-border skirmishes escalated into the First Seminole War, when American General Andrew Jackson led an incursion into the territory over Spanish objections. Jackson&#x27;s forces destroyed several Seminole, Mikasuki and Black Seminole towns, as well as captured Fort San Marcos and briefly occupied Pensacola before withdrawing in 1818. The U.S. and Spain soon negotiated the transfer of the territory with the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819.

The United States gained possession of Florida in 1821 and coerced the Seminoles into leaving their lands in the Florida panhandle for a large Indian reservation in the center of the peninsula per the Treaty of Moultrie Creek. In 1832 by the Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing, however, the federal government under United States President Andrew Jackson demanded that they leave Florida altogether and relocate to Indian Territory (modern day Oklahoma) as per the Indian Removal Act of 1830. A few bands reluctantly complied but most resisted violently, leading to the [[Second Seminole War]] (1835–1842), which was by far the longest and most wide-ranging of the three conflicts. Initially, less than 2000 Seminole warriors employed hit-and-run guerilla warfare tactics and knowledge of the land to evade and frustrate a combined U.S. Army and Marine force that grew to over 30,000. Instead of continuing to pursue these small bands, American commanders eventually changed their strategy and focused on seeking out and destroying hidden Seminole villages and crops, putting increasing pressure on resisters to surrender or starve with their families.

Most of the Seminole population had been relocated to Indian Territory or killed by the mid-1840s, though several hundred settled in central and southern Florida, where they were allowed to remain in an uneasy truce. Tensions over new settlement in the state under the Armed Occupation Act of 1842 south of Tampa led to renewed hostilities, and the Third Seminole War broke out in 1855. By the cessation of active fighting in 1858, the few remaining bands of Seminoles in Florida had fled deep into the Everglades to land unwanted by American settlers.

Taken together, the Seminole Wars were the longest, most expensive, and most deadly of all American Indian Wars.

==Overview==
===Background===

Spanish Florida was established in the 1500s, when Spain laid claim to land explored by several expeditions across the future southeastern United States. The introduction of diseases to the indigenous peoples of Florida caused a steep decline in the original native population over the following century, and most of the remaining Apalachee and Tequesta peoples settled in a series of missions spread out across north Florida. Spain never established real control over its vast claim outside of the immediate vicinity of its scattered missions and the towns of St. Augustine and Pensacola, however, and British settlers established several colonies along the Atlantic coast during the 1600s. After the establishment of the Province of Carolina in the late 17th century, a series of raids by British settlers from the Carolinas and their Indian allies into Spanish Florida devastated both the mission system and the remaining native population.

British settlers repeatedly came into conflict with Native Americans as the colonies expanded further westward, resulting in a stream of refugees relocating to depopulated areas of Florida. A majority of these refugees were Muscogee (Creek) Indians from Georgia and Alabama, and during the 1700s, they came together with other native peoples to establish independent chiefdoms and villages across the Florida panhandle as they coalesced into a new culture which became known as the Seminoles.

Beginning in the 1730s, Spain established a policy of providing refuge to runaway slaves in an attempt to weaken the British Southern Colonies. Hundreds of Black people escaped slavery to Florida over the ensuing decades, with most settling near St. Augustine at Fort Mose and a few living amongst the Seminole, who treated them with varying levels of equality. Their numbers increased during and after the American War of Independence, and it became common to find settlements of Black Seminoles either near Seminole towns or living independently, such as at Negro Fort on the Apalachicola River. The presence of a nearby refuge for free Africans was considered a threat to the institution of chattel slavery in the southern United States, and settlers in the border states of Mississippi and Georgia in particular accused the Seminoles of inciting slaves to escape and then stealing their human property. In retaliation, plantation owners organized repeated raids into Spanish Florida in which they captured Africans they accused of being escaped slaves and harassed the Seminole villages near the border, resulting in bands of Seminoles crossing into U.S. territory to stage reprisal attacks.

===First Seminole War (overview)===
The increasing border tensions came to a head on 26 December 1817, as the U.S. War Department wrote an order directing General Andrew Jackson to take command in person and bring the Seminoles under control, precipitating the First Seminole War. The war preceded with the destruction of the Negro Fort in July 1816, and subsequently Jackson&#x27;s forces destroyed several Seminole/Creek and Miccosukee settlements including Fowltown pursuing them and Black Seminoles and allied Maroons across northern Florida in 1818. Jackson&#x27;s expedition culminated in April 1818 with the Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident. The Spanish government expressed outrage over Jackson&#x27;s &quot;punitive expeditions&quot; into their territory and his brief occupation of Pensacola the capital of their colony of West Florida. But as was made clear by several local uprisings and other forms of &quot;border anarchy&quot;, Spain was no longer able to defend nor control Florida and eventually agreed to cede it to the United States per the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819, with the transfer taking place in 1821. According to the terms of the Treaty of Moultrie Creek (1823) between the United States and Seminole Nation, the Seminoles were removed from Northern Florida to a reservation in the center of the Florida peninsula, and the United States constructed a series of forts and trading posts along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts to enforce the treaty.

===Second Seminole War (overview)===
The Second Seminole War (1835–1842) began as a result of the United States unilaterally voiding the Treaty of Moultrie Creek and demanding that all Seminoles relocate to Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma under the Indian Removal Act (1830). After several ultimatums and the departure of a few Seminole clans per the Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing (1832), hostilities commenced in December 1835 with the Dade battle and continued for the next several years with a series of engagements throughout the peninsula and extending to the Florida Keys. Though the Seminole fighters were at a tactical and numerical disadvantage, Seminole military leaders effectively used guerrilla warfare to frustrate United States military forces, which eventually numbered over 30,000 regulars, militiamen and volunteers. General Thomas Sidney Jesup was sent to Florida to take command of the campaign in 1836. Instead of futilely pursuing parties of Seminole fighters through the territory as previous commanders had done, Jesup changed tactics and engaged in finding, capturing or destroying Seminole homes, livestock, farms, and related supplies, thus starving them out; a strategy which would be duplicated by General W. T. Sherman in his march to the sea during the American Civil War. Jesup also authorized the controversial abduction of Seminole leaders Osceola and Micanopy by luring them under a false flag of truce. General Jesup clearly violated the rules of war, and spent 21 years defending himself over it, &quot;Viewed from the distance of more than a century, it hardly seems worthwhile to try to grace the capture with any other label than &quot;.&quot;&quot; By the early 1840s, many Seminoles had been killed, and many more were forced by impending starvation to surrender and be removed to Indian Territory. Though there was no official peace treaty, several hundred Seminoles remained in central and southern Florida after active conflict wound down.

===Third Seminole War (overview)===
The Third Seminole War (1855–1858) was precipitated as an increasing number of settlers in central and southern Florida led to increasing tension with Seminoles and Miccosukees living in the area. In December 1855, U.S. Army personnel located and destroyed a large Seminole plantation west of the Everglades, perhaps to deliberately provoke a violent response that would result in the removal of the remaining Seminole citizens from the region. Holata Micco, a Seminole leader known as Billy Bowlegs by whites, responded with a raid near Fort Myers, leading to a series of retaliatory raids and small skirmishes with no large battles fought. Once again, the United States military strategy was to target Seminole civilians by destroying their food supply. By 1858, most of the remaining Seminoles, war weary and facing starvation, acquiesced to being removed to the Indian Territory in exchange for promises of safe passage and cash payments. An estimated 200 to 500 Seminoles in small family bands still refused to leave and retreated deep into the Everglades and the Big Cypress Swamp to live on land considered unsuitable by American settlers.

==Background==
===Colonial Florida===
====Decline of indigenous cultures====
The original indigenous peoples of Florida declined significantly in number after the arrival of European explorers in the early 1500s, mainly because the Native Americans had little resistance to diseases newly introduced from Europe. Spanish suppression of native revolts further reduced the population in northern Florida until the early 1600s, at which time the establishment of a series of Spanish missions improved relations and stabilized the population.

Beginning in the late-17th century, raids by British settlers from the colony of Carolina and their Indian allies began another steep decline in the indigenous population. By 1707, settlers based in Carolina and their Yamasee Indian allies had killed, carried off, or driven away most of the remaining native inhabitants during a series of raids across the Florida panhandle and down the full length of the peninsula. In the first decade of the 18th century. 10,000–12,000 Indians were taken as slaves according to the governor of La Florida and by 1710, observers noted that north Florida was virtually depopulated. The Spanish missions all closed, as without natives, there was nothing for them to do. The few remaining natives fled west to Pensacola and beyond or east to the vicinity of St. Augustine. When Spain ceded Florida to Great Britain as part of the Treaty of Paris in 1763, the majority of Florida&#x27;s Indians travelled with the Spanish to Cuba or New Spain.

====Origin of the Seminoles====
During the mid-1700s, small bands from various Native American tribes from the southeastern United States began moving into the unoccupied lands of Florida. In 1715, the Yamasee moved into Florida as allies of the Spanish, after conflicts with colonists from the Province of Carolina. Creek people, at first primarily the Lower Creek but later including Upper Creek, also started moving into Florida from the area of Georgia. The Mikasuki, &quot;Hitchiti&quot;-speakers, settled around what is now Lake Miccosukee near Tallahassee. (Descendants of this group have maintained a separate tribal identity as today&#x27;s Miccosukee.)

Another group of Hitchiti speakers, led by Cowkeeper, settled in what is now Alachua County, an area where the Spanish had maintained cattle ranches in the 17th century. Because one of the best-known ranches was called &quot;la Chua&quot;, the region became known as the &quot;Alachua Prairie&quot;. The Spanish in Saint Augustine began calling the Alachua Creek &quot;Cimarrones&quot;, which roughly meant &quot;wild ones&quot; or &quot;runaways&quot;. This was the probable origin of the term &quot;Seminole&quot;. This name was eventually applied to the other groups in Florida, although the Indians still regarded themselves as members of different tribes. Other Native American groups in Florida during the Seminole Wars included the Choctaw, Yuchi, Spanish Indians (so called because it was believed that they were descended from Calusas), and &quot;rancho Indians&quot;, who lived at Spanish/Cuban fishing camps (ranchos) on the Florida coast.

In 1738, the Spanish governor of Florida, Manuel de Montiano, had Fort Mose built and established as a free Black settlement. Fugitive African and African American slaves who could reach the fort were essentially free. Many were from Pensacola; some were free citizens, though others had escaped from United States territory. The Spanish offered the slaves freedom and land in Florida. They recruited former slaves as militia to help defend Pensacola and Fort Mose. Other fugitive slaves joined Seminole bands as free members of the tribe.

Most of the former slaves at Fort Mose went to Cuba with the Spanish when they left Florida in 1763, while others lived with or near various bands of Indians. Fugitive slaves from the Carolinas and Georgia continued to make their way to Florida, as the Underground Railroad ran south. The Blacks who stayed with or later joined the Seminoles became integrated into the tribes, learning the languages, adopting the dress, and inter-marrying. The blacks knew how to farm and served as interpreters between the Seminole and the whites. Some of the Black Seminoles, as they were called, became important tribal leaders.

===Early conflict===

During the American Revolutionary War, the British, who controlled Florida, recruited Seminoles to raid Patriot-aligned settlements on the Georgia frontier. The confusion of war allowed American slaves to escape to Florida, where local British authorities promised them their freedom for in exchange for military service. These events made the new United States enemies of the Seminoles. In 1783, as part of the treaty ending the Revolutionary War, Florida, was returned to Spain. Spain&#x27;s grip on Florida was light, as it maintained only small garrisons at St. Augustine, St. Marks and Pensacola. They did not control the border between Florida and the United States and were unable to act against the State of Muskogee established in 1799, envisioned as a single nation of American Indians independent of both Spain and the United States, until 1803 when both nations conspired to entrap its founder. Mikasukis and other Seminole groups still occupied towns on the United States side of the border, while American squatters moved into Spanish Florida.

The British had divided Florida into East Florida and West Florida in 1763, a division retained by the Spanish when they regained Florida in 1783. West Florida extended from the Apalachicola River to the Mississippi River. Together with their possession of Louisiana, the Spanish controlled the lower reaches of all of the rivers draining the United States west of the Appalachian Mountains. It prohibited the US from transport and trade on the lower Mississippi. In addition to its desire to expand west of the mountains, the United States wanted to acquire Florida. It wanted to gain free commerce on western rivers, and to prevent Florida from being used a base for possible invasion of the U.S. by a European country.

===The Louisiana Purchase===
In order to obtain a port on the Gulf of Mexico with secure access for Americans, United States diplomats in Europe were instructed to try to purchase the Isle of Orleans and West Florida from whichever country owned them. When Robert Livingston approached France in 1803 about buying the Isle of Orleans, the French government offered to sell it and all of Louisiana as well. While the purchase of Louisiana exceeded their authorization, Livingston and James Monroe (who had been sent to help him negotiate the sale) in the deliberations with France pursued a claim that the area east of the Mississippi to the Perdido River was part of Louisiana. As part of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase treaty, France repeated verbatim Article 3 of its 1800 treaty with Spain, thus expressly subrogating the United States to the rights of France and Spain.p. 288–291

The ambiguity in this third article lent itself to the purpose of U.S. envoy James Monroe, although he had to adopt an interpretation that France had not asserted, nor Spain allowed.p 83 Monroe examined each clause of the third article and interpreted the first clause as if Spain since 1783 had considered West Florida as part of Louisiana. The second clause only served to render the first clause clearer. The third clause referred to the treaties of 1783 and 1795 and was designed to safeguard the rights of the United States. This clause then simply gave effect to the others.p 84–85 According to Monroe, France never dismembered Louisiana while it was in her possession. (He regarded 3 November 1762, as the termination date of French possession, rather than 1769, when France formally delivered Louisiana to Spain).

President Thomas Jefferson had initially believed that the Louisiana Purchase included West Florida and gave the United States a strong claim to Texas. President Jefferson asked U.S. officials in the border area for advice on the limits of Louisiana, the best informed of whom did not believe it included West Florida.p 87-88 Later, in an 1809 letter, Jefferson virtually admitted that West Florida was not a possession of the United States.p 46–47

During his negotiations with France, U.S. envoy Robert Livingston wrote nine reports to Madison in which he stated that West Florida was not in the possession of France.p 43–44 In November 1804, in response to Livingston, France declared the American claim to West Florida absolutely unfounded.p 113–116 Upon the failure of Monroe&#x27;s later 1804–1805 mission, Madison was ready to abandon the American claim to West Florida altogether.p 118 In 1805, Monroe&#x27;s last proposition to Spain to obtain West Florida was absolutely rejected, and American plans to establish a customs house at Mobile Bay in 1804 were dropped in the face of Spanish protests.p 293

The United States also hoped to acquire all of the Gulf coast east of Louisiana, and plans were made to offer to buy the remainder of West Florida (between the Perdido and Apalachicola rivers) and all of East Florida. It was soon decided, however, that rather than paying for the colonies, the United States would offer to assume Spanish debts to American citizens in return for Spain ceding the Floridas. The American position was that it was placing a lien on East Florida in lieu of seizing the colony to settle the debts.

In 1808, Napoleon invaded Spain, forced Ferdinand VII, King of Spain, to abdicate, and installed his brother Joseph Bonaparte as King. Resistance to the French invasion coalesced in a national government, the Cortes of Cádiz. This government then entered into an alliance with Britain against France. This alliance raised fears in the United States that the British would establish military bases in Spanish colonies, including the Floridas, and as such potentially compromise the security of the southern frontiers of the U.S.

===West Florida===

By 1810, during the Peninsular War, Spain was largely overrun by the French army. Rebellions against the Spanish authorities broke out in many of its American colonies. Settlers in West Florida and in the adjacent Mississippi Territory started organizing in the summer of 1810 to seize Mobile and Pensacola, the last of which was outside the part of West Florida claimed by the United States.

Residents of westernmost West Florida (between the Mississippi and Pearl rivers) organized a convention at Baton Rouge in the summer of 1810. The convention was concerned about maintaining public order and preventing control of the district from falling into French hands; at first it tried to establish a government under local control that was nominally loyal to Ferdinand VII. After discovering that the Spanish governor of the district had appealed for military aid to put down an &quot;insurrection&quot;, residents of the Baton Rouge District overthrew the local Spanish authorities on 23 September by seizing the Spanish fort in Baton Rouge. On 26 September, the convention declared West Florida to be independent.

Pro-Spanish, pro-American, and pro-independence factions quickly formed in the newly proclaimed republic. The pro-American faction appealed to the United States to annex the area and to provide financial aid. On 27 October 1810, U.S. President James Madison proclaimed that the United States should take possession of West Florida between the Mississippi and Perdido Rivers, based on the tenuous claim that it was part of the Louisiana Purchase.

Madison authorized William C. C. Claiborne, governor of the Territory of Orleans, to take possession of the territory. He entered the capital of St. Francisville with his forces on 6 December 1810, and Baton Rouge on 10 December 1810. The West Florida government opposed annexation, preferring to negotiate terms to join the Union. Governor Fulwar Skipwith proclaimed that he and his men would &quot;surround the Flag-Staff and die in its defense&quot;. Claiborne refused to recognize the legitimacy of the West Florida government, however, and Skipwith and the legislature eventually agreed to accept Madison&#x27;s proclamation. Claiborne only occupied the area west of the Pearl River (the current eastern boundary of Louisiana).

Juan Vicente Folch y Juan, governor of West Florida, hoping to avoid fighting, abolished customs duties on American goods at Mobile, and offered to surrender all of West Florida to the United States if he had not received help or instructions from Havana or Veracruz by the end of the year.

Fearing that France would overrun all of Spain, with the presumed result being that Spanish colonies would either fall under French control or be seized by the British, in January 1811, Madison requested the U.S. Congress pass legislation authorizing the United States to take &quot;temporary possession&quot; of any territory adjacent to the United States east of the Perdido River, i.e., the balance of West Florida and all of East Florida. The United States would be authorized to either accept transfer of territory from &quot;local authorities&quot; or occupy territory to prevent it falling into the hands of a foreign power other than Spain. Congress debated and passed, on 15 January 1811, the requested resolution in closed session, and provided that the resolution could be kept secret until as late as March 1812.

American forces occupied most of the Spanish territory between the Pearl and Perdido rivers (today&#x27;s coastal Mississippi and Alabama), with the exception of the area around Mobile, in 1811. Mobile was occupied by United States forces in 1813.

Madison sent George Mathews to deal with the disputes over West Florida. When Vicente Folch rescinded his offer to turn the remainder of West Florida over to the U.S., Mathews traveled to East Florida to engage the Spanish authorities there. When that effort failed, Mathews, in an extreme interpretation of his orders, schemed to incite a rebellion similar to that in the Baton Rouge District.

===Patriot War of East Florida (1812)===

In 1812, General George Mathews was commissioned by President James Madison to approach the Spanish governor of East Florida in an attempt to acquire the territory. His instructions were to take possession of any part of the territory of the Floridas upon making &quot;arrangement&quot; with the &quot;local authority&quot; to deliver possession to the U.S. Barring that or invasion by another foreign power, they were not to take possession of any part of Florida. Most of the residents of East Florida were happy with the status quo, so Mathews raised a force of volunteers in Georgia with a promise of arms and continued defense. On 16 March 1812, this force of &quot;Patriots&quot;, with the aid of nine U.S. Navy gunboats, seized the town of Fernandina on Amelia Island, just south of the border with Georgia, approximately 50 miles north of St. Augustine.

On 17 March, the Patriots and the town&#x27;s Spanish authorities signed articles of capitulation. The next day, a detachment of 250 regular United States troops were brought over from Point Peter, Georgia, and the Patriots surrendered the town to Gen. George Mathews, who had the U.S. flag raised immediately. As agreed, the Patriots held Fernandina for only one day before turning authority over to the U.S. military, an event that soon gave the U.S. control of the coast to St. Augustine. Within several days the Patriots, along with a regiment of regular Army troops and Georgian volunteers, moved toward St. Augustine. On this march the Patriots were slightly in advance of the American troops. The Patriots would proclaim possession of some ground, raise the Patriot flag, and as the &quot;local authority&quot; surrender the territory to the United States troops, who would then substitute the American flag for the Patriot flag. The Patriots faced no opposition as they marched, usually with Gen. Mathews. Accounts of witnesses state that the Patriots could have made no progress but for the protection of the U.S. forces and could not have maintained their position in the country without the aid of the U.S. troops. The American troops and Patriots acted in close concert, marching, camping, foraging and fighting together. In this way, the American troops sustained the Patriots, who, however, were unable to take the Castillo de San Marcos in St. Augustine.

As soon as the U.S. government was notified of these events, Congress became alarmed at the possibility of being drawn into war with Spain, and the effort fell apart. Secretary of State James Monroe promptly disavowed the actions and relieved Gen. Mathews of his commission on 9 May, on the grounds that neither of the instructed contingencies had occurred. However, peace negotiations with the Spanish authorities were protracted and slow. Through the summer and autumn, the U.S. and Patriot troops foraged and plundered almost every plantation and farm, most of them having been abandoned by their owners. The troops helped themselves to everything they could find. Stored food was used up, growing crops destroyed or fed to horses, all types of movable property plundered or destroyed, buildings and fences burned, cattle and hogs killed or stolen for butchering, and slaves often dispersed or abducted. This continued until May 1813 and left the formerly inhabited parts in a state of desolation.

In June 1812, George Mathews met with King Payne and other Seminole leaders. After the meeting, Mathews believed that the Seminoles would remain neutral in the conflict. Sebastián Kindelán y O&#x27;Regan, the governor of East Florida, tried to induce the Seminoles to fight on the Spanish side. Some of the Seminoles wanted to fight the Georgians in the Patriot Army, but King Payne and others held out for peace. The Seminoles were not happy with Spanish rule, comparing their treatment under the Spanish unfavorably with that received from the British when they held Florida. Ahaya, or Cowkeeper, King Payne&#x27;s predecessor, had sworn to kill 100 Spaniards, and on his deathbed lamented having killed only 84. At a second conference with the Patriot Army leaders, the Seminoles again promised to remain neutral.

The blacks living in Florida outside of St. Augustine, many of whom were former slaves from Georgia and South Carolina, were not disposed to be neutral. Often slaves in name only to Seminoles, they lived in freedom and feared loss of that freedom if the United States took Florida away from Spain. Many blacks enlisted in the defense of St. Augustine, while others urged the Seminoles to fight the Patriot Army. In a third meeting with Seminole leaders, the Patriot Army leaders threatened the Seminoles with destruction if they fought on the side of the Spanish. This threat gave the Seminoles favoring war, led by King Payne&#x27;s brother Bolek (also known as Bowlegs) the upper hand. Joined by warriors from Alligator (near present-day Lake City) and other towns, the Seminoles sent 200 Indians and 40 blacks to attack the Patriots.

In retaliation for Seminole raids, in September 1812, Colonel Daniel Newnan led 117 Georgia militiamen in an attempt to seize the Alachua Seminole lands around Payne&#x27;s Prairie. Newnan&#x27;s force never reached the Seminole towns, losing eight men dead, eight missing, and nine wounded after battling Seminoles for more than a week. A contingent of about 165 expansionist Tennesseans led by Colonel John Williams of Knoxville marched south beginning in December 1812, headed for the Georgia–Florida border of St. Mary&#x27;s River. Four months later Lt. Colonel Thomas Adams Smith led 220 U.S. Army regulars and the Tennessee volunteers in a raid on Payne&#x27;s Town, the chief town of the Alachua Seminoles. Smith&#x27;s force found a few Indians, but the Alachua Seminoles had abandoned Payne&#x27;s Town and moved southward. After burning Payne&#x27;s Town, Smith&#x27;s force returned to American held territory. 

Negotiations concluded for the withdrawal of U.S. troops in 1813. On 6 May 1813, the army lowered the flag at Fernandina and crossed the St. Marys River to Georgia with the remaining troops.

===District of Elotchaway===

After the United States government disavowed support of the Territory of East Florida and withdrew American troops and ships from Spanish territory, most of the Patriots in East Florida either withdrew to Georgia or accepted the offer of amnesty from the Spanish government. Some of the Patriots still dreamed of claiming land in Florida. One of them, Buckner Harris, had been involved in recruiting men for the Patriot Army and was the President of the Legislative Council of the Territory of East Florida. Harris became the leader of a small band of Patriots who roamed the countryside threatening residents who had accepted pardons from the Spanish government.

Buckner Harris developed a plan to establish a settlement in the Alachua Country with financial support from the State of Georgia, the cession of land by treaty from the Seminoles, and a land grant from Spain. Harris petitioned the governor of Georgia for money, stating that a settlement of Americans in the Alachua Country would help keep the Seminoles away from the Georgia border, and would be able to intercept runaway slaves from Georgia before they could reach the Seminoles. Unfortunately for Harris, Georgia did not have funds available. Harris also hoped to acquire the land around the Alachua Prairie (Paynes Prairie) by treaty from the Seminoles but could not persuade the Seminoles to meet with him. The Spanish were also not interested in dealing with Harris.

In January 1814, 70 men led by Buckner Harris crossed from Georgia into East Florida, headed for the Alachua Country. More men joined them as they traveled through East Florida, with more than 90 in the group when they reached the site of Payne&#x27;s Town, which had been burned in 1812. The men built a 25-foot square, two-story blockhouse, which they named Fort Mitchell, after David Mitchell, former governor of Georgia and a supporter of the Patriot invasion of East Florida. By the time the blockhouse was completed, there were reported to be more than 160 men present in Elotchaway. On 25 January 1814, the settlers established a government, titled &quot;The District of Elotchaway of the Republic of East Florida&quot;, with Buckner Harris as Director. The Legislative Council then petitioned the United States Congress to accept the District of Elotchaway as a territory of the United States. The petition was signed by 106 &quot;citizens of Elotchaway.&quot; The Elotchaway settlers laid out farm plots and started planting crops. Some of the men apparently had brought families with them, as a child was born in Elotchaway on 15 March 1814.

Buckner Harris hoped to expand American settlement in the Alachua Country and rode out alone to explore the area. On 5 May 1814, he was ambushed and killed by Seminoles. Without Harris, the District of Elotchaway collapsed. Fort Mitchell was abandoned, with all the settlers gone within two weeks. Some of the men at Fort Mitchell who signed the petition to Congress settled again in the Alachua Country after Florida was transferred to the United States in 1821.

===The Creek War, the War of 1812 and the Negro Fort===


During the Creek War (1813–1814), Colonel Andrew Jackson became a national hero with his victory over the Creek Red Sticks at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. After this victory, Jackson forced the Treaty of Fort Jackson on the Creek, resulting in the loss of much Creek territory in what is today southern Georgia and central and southern Alabama. As a result, many Creek left Alabama and Georgia, and moved to Spanish West Florida. The Creek refugees joined the Seminole of Florida.

In 1814, Britain was still at war with the United States, and in May, a British force entered the mouth of the Apalachicola River, and moved upriver to begin building a fort at Prospect Bluff. This British Post at Prospect Bluff harbored Native American refugees from the Creek War following their demise at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. A company of Royal Marines, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Nicolls, was to subsequently arrive, but was invited to relocate to Pensacola in late August 1814. It was estimated, by Captain Nicholas Lockyer of , that in August 1814 there were 1,000 Indians at Pensacola, of whom 700 were warriors. Two months after the British and their Indian allies were beaten back from an attack on Fort Bowyer near Mobile, a U.S. force led by General Jackson drove the British and Spanish out of Pensacola, and back to the Apalachicola River. They managed to continue work on the fort at Prospect Bluff.

When the War of 1812 ended, all British forces left the Gulf of Mexico except for Nicolls and his forces in Spanish West Florida. He directed the provisioning of the fort at Prospect Bluff with cannon, muskets, and ammunition. He told his Native American allies that the Treaty of Ghent guaranteed the return of all Indian lands lost to the United States during the War of 1812, including the Creek lands in Georgia and Alabama. Before Nicolls left in the spring of 1815, he turned the fort over to the maroons and Native American allies whom he had originally recruited for possible incursions into U.S. territory during the war. (see Corps of Colonial Marines). As word spread in the American Southeast about the fort, white Americans called it the &quot;Negro Fort.&quot; Americans worried that it would inspire their slaves to escape to Florida or revolt.

Acknowledging that it was in Spanish territory, in April 1816, Jackson informed Governor José Masot of West Florida that if the Spanish did not eliminate the fort, he would. The governor replied that he did not have the forces to take the fort.

Jackson assigned Brigadier General Edmund Pendleton Gaines to take control of the fort. Gaines directed Colonel Duncan Lamont Clinch to build Fort Scott on the Flint River just north of the Florida border. Gaines said he intended to supply Fort Scott from New Orleans via the Apalachicola River. As this would mean passing through Spanish territory and past the Negro Fort, it would allow the U.S. Army to keep an eye on the Seminole and the Negro Fort. If the fort fired on the supply boats, the Americans would have an excuse to destroy it.

In July 1816, a supply fleet for Fort Scott reached the Apalachicola River. Clinch took a force of more than 100 American soldiers and about 150 Lower Creek warriors, including the chief Tustunnugee Hutkee (White Warrior), to protect their passage. The supply fleet met Clinch at the Negro Fort, and its two gunboats took positions across the river from the fort. The inhabitants of the fort fired their cannon at the invading U.S. soldiers and the Creek but had no training in aiming the weapon. The American military fired back, and the gunboats&#x27; ninth shot, a &quot;hot shot&quot; (a cannonball heated to a red glow), landed in the fort&#x27;s powder magazine. The explosion leveled the fort and It has been called &quot;the single deadliest cannon shot in American history.&quot; Of the 320 people known to be in the fort, including women and children, more than 250 died instantly, and many more died from their injuries soon after. Once the US Army destroyed the fort, it withdrew from Spanish Florida.

American squatters and outlaws raided the Seminole, killing villagers and stealing their cattle. Seminole resentment grew and they retaliated by stealing back the cattle. On 24 February 1817, a raiding party killed Mrs. Garrett, a woman living in Camden County, Georgia, and her two young children.
===Fowltown and the Scott Massacre===
Fowltown was a Mikasuki (Creek) village in southwestern Georgia, about east of Fort Scott. Chief Neamathla of Fowltown got into a dispute with the commander of Fort Scott over the use of land on the eastern side of the Flint River, essentially claiming Mikasuki sovereignty over the area. The land in southern Georgia had been ceded by the Creeks in the Treaty of Fort Jackson, but the Mikasukis did not consider themselves Creek, did not feel bound by the treaty which they had not signed, and did not accept that the Creeks had any right to cede Mikasuki land. On 21 November 1817, General Gaines sent a force of 250 men to seize Fowltown. The first attempt was beaten off by the Mikasukis. The next day, 22 November 1817, the Mikasukis were driven from their village. Some historians date the start of the war to this attack on Fowltown. David Brydie Mitchell, former governor of Georgia and Creek Indian agent at the time, stated in a report to Congress that the attack on Fowltown was the start of the First Seminole War.

A week later a boat carrying supplies for Fort Scott, under the command of Lieutenant Richard W. Scott, was attacked on the Apalachicola River. There were forty to fifty people on the boat, including twenty sick soldiers, seven wives of soldiers, and possibly some children. (While there are reports of four children being killed by the Seminoles, they were not mentioned in early reports of the massacre, and their presence has not been confirmed.) Most of the boat&#x27;s passengers were killed by the Indians. One woman was taken prisoner, and six survivors made it to the fort.

While General Gaines had been under orders not to invade Florida, he later decided to allow short intrusions into Florida. When news of the Scott Massacre on the Apalachicola reached Washington, Gaines was ordered to invade Florida and pursue the Indians but not to attack any Spanish installations. However, Gaines had left for East Florida to deal with pirates who had occupied Fernandina. Secretary of War John C. Calhoun then ordered Andrew Jackson to lead the invasion of Florida.

==First Seminole War==
There is no consensus about the beginning and ending dates for the First Seminole War. The U.S. Army Infantry indicates that it lasted from 1814 until 1819. The U.S. Navy Naval Historical Center gives dates of 1816–1818. Another Army site dates the war as 1817–1818. Finally, the unit history of the 1st Battalion, 5th Field Artillery describes the war as occurring solely in 1818.

=== East Florida (east side of Apalachicola River) ===
Jackson gathered his forces at Fort Scott in March 1818, including 800 U.S. Army regulars, 1,000 Tennessee volunteers, 1,000 Georgia militia, and about 1,400 friendly Lower Creek warriors (under command of Brigadier General William McIntosh, a Creek chief). On 15 March, Jackson&#x27;s army entered Florida, marching down the banks of the Apalachicola River. When they reached the site of the Negro Fort, Jackson had his men construct a new fort, Fort Gadsden. The army then set out for the Mikasuki villages around Lake Miccosukee. The Indian town of Anhaica (today&#x27;s Tallahassee) was burned on 31 March, and the town of Miccosukee was taken the next day. More than 300 Indian homes were destroyed. Jackson then turned south, reaching Fort St. Marks (&quot;San Marcos&quot;) on 6 April.
Upon reaching St. Marks, Jackson wrote to the commandant of the fort, Don Francisco Caso y Luengo, to tell him that he had invaded Florida at the President&#x27;s instruction. He wrote that after capturing the wife of Chief Chennabee, she had testified to the Seminoles retrieving ammunition from the fort. He explained that, because of this, the fort had already been taken over by the people living in the Mekasukian towns he had just destroyed and to prevent that from happening again, the fort would have to be guarded by American troops. He justified this on the &quot;principal of self defense.&quot; By claiming that through this action he was a &quot;Friend of Spain&quot;, Jackson was attempting to take possession of St. Marks by convincing the Spanish that they were allies with the American army against the Seminoles. Luengo responded, agreeing that he and Jackson were allies but denying the story that Chief Chennabee&#x27;s wife had told, claiming that the Seminoles had not taken ammunition from or possession of the fort. He expressed to Jackson that he was worried about the challenges he would face if he allowed American troops to occupy the fort without first getting authorization from Spain. Despite Leungo asking him not to occupy the fort, Jackson seized St. Marks on 7 April. There he found Alexander George Arbuthnot, a Scottish trader based out of the Bahamas. He traded with the Indians in Florida and had written letters to British and American officials on behalf of the Indians. He was rumored to be selling guns to the Indians and to be preparing them for war. He probably was selling guns, since the main trade item of the Indians was deer skins, and they needed guns to hunt the deer. Two Indian leaders, Josiah Francis (Hillis Hadjo), a Red Stick Creek also known as the &quot;Prophet&quot; (not to be confused with Tenskwatawa), and Homathlemico, had been captured when they had gone out to an American ship flying the Union Flag that had anchored off of St. Marks. As soon as Jackson arrived at St. Marks, the two Indians were brought ashore and hanged without trial.

Jackson left Fort St. Marks to attack the Native American Bolek&#x27;s (aka &quot;Bowlegs&quot;) old town and maroon villages (Nero&#x27;s town) along the Suwannee River near the current Old Town, FL. On 12 April, en route to the Suwannee the U.S. army and allied Native Americans led by William McIntosh, found and attacked a Red Stick village led by Peter McQueen on the Econfina River. Close to 40 Red Sticks were killed, and about 100 women and children were captured.[citation needed] In the village, they found Elizabeth Stewart, the woman who had been captured in the attack (the Scott Massacre) on the supply boat on the Apalachicola River the previous November near modern Chattahochee, Florida. Having destroyed the major Seminole and black villages, Jackson declared victory and sent the Georgia militiamen and the Lower Creeks home. The remaining army then returned to Fort St. Marks.

About this time, Robert Ambrister, a former officer in the Corps of Colonial Marines, was captured by Jackson&#x27;s troops. At St. Marks a military tribunal was convened, and Ambrister and Arbuthnot were charged with aiding the Seminoles and the Spanish, inciting them to war and leading them against the United States. Ambrister threw himself on the mercy of the court, while Arbuthnot maintained his innocence, saying that he had only been engaged in legal trade. The tribunal sentenced both men to death but then relented and changed Ambrister&#x27;s sentence to fifty lashes and a year at hard labor. Jackson, however, reinstated Ambrister&#x27;s death penalty. Ambrister was executed by a firing squad of American troops on 29 April 1818. Arbuthnot was hanged from the yardarm of his own ship.

Jackson left a garrison at Fort St. Marks and returned to Fort Gadsden. Jackson had first reported that all was peaceful and that he would be returning to Nashville, Tennessee.

=== West Florida (west of the Apalachicola River) ===
General Jackson later reported that Indians were gathering and being supplied by the Spanish, and he left Fort Gadsden with 1,000 men on 7 May, headed for Pensacola. The governor of West Florida protested that most of the Indians at Pensacola were women and children and that the men were unarmed, but Jackson did not stop. Jackson also stated (in a letter to George W. Campbell) that the seizure of supplies meant for Fort Crawford gave additional reason for his march on Pensacola. When he reached Pensacola on 23 May, the governor and the 175-man Spanish garrison retreated to Fort Barrancas, leaving the city of Pensacola to Jackson. The two sides exchanged cannon fire for a couple of days, and then the Spanish surrendered Fort Barrancas on 28 May. Jackson left Colonel William King as military governor of West Florida and went home.

===Consequences===
There were international repercussions to Jackson&#x27;s actions. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams had just started negotiations with Spain for the purchase of Florida. Spain protested the invasion and seizure of West Florida and suspended the negotiations. Spain did not have the means to retaliate against the United States or regain West Florida by force, so Adams let the Spanish officials protest, then issued a letter (with 72 supporting documents) claiming that the United States was defending her national interests against the British, Spanish and Native Americans. In the letter he also apologized for the seizure of West Florida, said that it had not been American policy to seize Spanish territory, and offered to give St. Marks and Pensacola back to Spain. This notably did not include the return of Fort Gadsden.
The British government protested the execution of two of its subjects who had never entered United States territory. A number of British commentators discussed the possibility of demanding reparations and taking reprisals. At the end, Britain refused to risk another war with the United States due to a variety of factors, including the increasing importance of British trade with the United States, particularly in grain and cotton. British foreign secretary Lord Castlereagh chose not to let the incident interfere with the warming relations between the two countries, and continued on with plans for the Anglo-American Convention of 1818.

Spain, seeing that the British would not join them in making a strong denouncement of the Florida invasion, accepted and eventually resumed negotiations for the sale of Florida. Defending Jackson&#x27;s actions as necessary, and sensing that they strengthened his diplomatic standing, Adams demanded Spain either control the inhabitants of East Florida or cede it to the United States. An agreement was then reached whereby Spain ceded East Florida to the United States and renounced all claim to West Florida.

There were also repercussions in America. Congressional committees held hearings into the irregularities of the Ambrister and Arbuthnot trials. While most Americans supported Jackson, some worried that Jackson could become a &quot;man on horseback&quot;, a second Napoleon, and transform the United States into a military dictatorship. When Congress reconvened in December 1818, resolutions were introduced condemning Jackson&#x27;s actions. Jackson was too popular, and the resolutions failed, but the Ambrister and Arbuthnot executions left a stain on his reputation for the rest of his life, although it was not enough to keep him from becoming president. Jackson was accused of having initiated the war on his own authority, possibly for corrupt purpose, such as a land speculation in Pensacola. When the charges followed him through his later presidential campaigns he started lying that he had actually been authorized to invade by a secret message sent to him and him alone by James Monroe through congressman John Rhea, and that he had later burned secret message on orders of Monroe during the Congressional investigation. The so-called Rhea letter has been proven multiple times to have been a bit of extended trickery upon which Jackson constructed later feuds; the consensus of historians remains that &quot;not only did [the Rhea letter] not exist, but could not have existed.&quot;

==First Interbellum==
Spain ceded Florida to the United States in 1819 with the Adams–Onís Treaty, and the United States took possession in 1821. Effective government was slow in coming to Florida. General Andrew Jackson was appointed military governor in March 1821, but he did not arrive in Pensacola until July. He resigned the post in September and returned home in October, having spent just three months in Florida. His successor, William P. Duval, was not appointed until April 1822, and he left for an extended visit to his home in Kentucky before the end of the year. Other official positions in the territory had similar turn-over and absences.

The Seminoles were still a problem for the new government. In early 1822, Capt. John R. Bell, provisional secretary of the Florida territory and temporary agent to the Seminoles, prepared an estimate of the number of Indians in Florida. He reported about 22,000 Indians, and 5,000 slaves held by Indians. He estimated that two-thirds of them were refugees from the Creek War, with no valid claim (in the U.S. view) to Florida. Indian settlements were located in the areas around the Apalachicola River, along the Suwannee River, from there south-eastwards to the Alachua Prairie, and then south-westward to a little north of Tampa Bay.

Officials in Florida were concerned from the beginning about the situation with the Seminoles. Until a treaty was signed establishing a reservation, the Indians were not sure of where they could plant crops and expect to be able to harvest them, and they had to contend with white squatters moving into land they occupied. There was no system for licensing traders, and unlicensed traders were supplying the Seminoles with liquor. However, because of the part-time presence and frequent turnover of territorial officials, meetings with the Seminoles were canceled, postponed, or sometimes held merely to set a time and place for a new meeting.

===Treaty of Moultrie Creek===

In 1823, the government decided to settle the Seminole on a reservation in the central part of the territory. A meeting to negotiate a treaty was scheduled for early September 1823 at Moultrie Creek, south of St. Augustine. About 425 Seminole attended the meeting, choosing &quot;Neamathla&quot; to be their chief representative or Speaker. Under the terms of the treaty negotiated there, the Seminole were forced to go under the protection of the United States and give up all claim to lands in Florida, in exchange for a reservation of about four million acres (16,000 km2). The reservation would run down the middle of the Florida peninsula from just north of present-day Ocala to a line even with the southern end of Tampa Bay. The boundaries were well inland from both coasts, to prevent contact with traders from Cuba and the Bahamas. Neamathla and five other chiefs were allowed to keep their villages along the Apalachicola River.

Under the Treaty of Moultrie Creek, the US was obligated to protect the Seminole as long as they remained law-abiding. The government was supposed to distribute farm implements, cattle and hogs to the Seminole, compensate them for travel and losses involved in relocating to the reservation, and provide rations for a year, until the Seminoles could plant and harvest new crops. The government was also supposed to pay the tribe US$5,000 per year for twenty years and provide an interpreter, a school and a blacksmith for twenty years. In turn, the Seminole had to allow roads to be built across the reservation and had to apprehend and return to US jurisdiction any runaway slaves or other fugitives.

Implementation of the treaty stalled. Fort Brooke, with four companies of infantry, was established on the site of present-day Tampa in early 1824, to show the Seminole that the government was serious about moving them onto the reservation. However, by June James Gadsden, who was the principal author of the treaty and charged with implementing it, was reporting that the Seminole were unhappy with the treaty and were hoping to renegotiate it. Fear of a new war crept in. In July, Governor DuVal mobilized the militia and ordered the Tallahassee and Miccosukee chiefs to meet him in St. Marks. At that meeting, he ordered the Seminole to move to the reservation by 1 October 1824.

The move had not begun, but DuVal began paying the Seminole compensation for the improvements they were having to leave as an incentive to move. He also had the promised rations sent to Fort Brooke on Tampa Bay for distribution. The Seminole finally began moving onto the reservation, but within a year some returned to their former homes between the Suwannee and Apalachicola rivers. By 1826, most of the Seminole had gone to the reservation, but were not thriving. They had to clear and plant new fields, and cultivated fields suffered in a long drought. Some of the tribe were reported to have starved to death. Both Col. George M. Brooke, commander of Fort Brooke, and Governor DuVal wrote to Washington seeking help for the starving Seminole, but the requests got caught up in a debate over whether the people should be moved to west of the Mississippi River. For five months, no additional relief reached the Seminole.

The Seminoles slowly settled into the reservation, although they had isolated clashes with whites. Fort King was built near the reservation agency, at the site of present-day Ocala, and by early 1827 the Army could report that the Seminoles were on the reservation and Florida was peaceful. During the five-year peace, some settlers continued to call for removal. The Seminole were opposed to any such move, and especially to the suggestion that they join their Creek relations. Most whites regarded the Seminole as simply Creeks who had recently moved to Florida, while the Seminole claimed Florida as their home and denied that they had any connection with the Creeks.

The Seminoles and slave catchers argued over the ownership of slaves. New plantations in Florida increased the pool of slaves who could escape to Seminole territory. Worried about the possibility of an Indian uprising and/or a slave rebellion, Governor DuVal requested additional Federal troops for Florida, but in 1828 the US closed Fort King. Short of food and finding the hunting declining on the reservation, the Seminole wandered off to get food. In 1828, Andrew Jackson, the old enemy of the Seminoles, was elected President of the United States. In 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act he promoted, which was to resolve the problems by moving the Seminole and other tribes west of the Mississippi.

===Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing===

In the spring of 1832, the Seminoles on the reservation were called to a meeting at Payne&#x27;s Landing on the Oklawaha River. The treaty negotiated there called for the Seminoles to move west, if the land were found to be suitable. They were to settle on the Creek reservation and become part of the Creek tribe. The delegation of seven chiefs who were to inspect the new reservation did not leave Florida until October 1832. After touring the area for several months and conferring with the Creeks who had already been settled there, the seven chiefs signed a statement on 28 March 1833, that the new land was acceptable. Upon their return to Florida, however, most of the chiefs renounced the statement, claiming that they had not signed it, or that they had been forced to sign it, and in any case, that they did not have the power to decide for all the tribes and bands that resided on the reservation. The villages in the area of the Apalachicola River were more easily persuaded, however, and went west in 1834.

The United States Senate finally ratified the Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing in April 1834. The treaty had given the Seminoles three years to move west of the Mississippi. The government interpreted the three years as starting 1832 and expected the Seminoles to move in 1835. Fort King was reopened in 1834. A new Seminole agent, Wiley Thompson, had been appointed in 1834, and the task of persuading the Seminoles to move fell to him. He called the chiefs together at Fort King in October 1834 to talk to them about the removal to the west. The Seminoles informed Thompson that they had no intention of moving and that they did not feel bound by the Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing. Thompson then requested reinforcements for Fort King and Fort Brooke, reporting that, &quot;the Indians after they had received the Annuity, purchased an unusually large quantity of Powder &amp; Lead.&quot; General Clinch also warned Washington that the Seminoles did not intend to move and that more troops would be needed to force them to move. In March 1835, Thompson called the chiefs together to read a letter from Andrew Jackson to them. In his letter, Jackson said, &quot;Should you ... refuse to move, I have then directed the Commanding officer to remove you by force.&quot; The chiefs asked for thirty days to respond. A month later, the Seminole chiefs told Thompson that they would not move west. Thompson and the chiefs began arguing, and General Clinch had to intervene to prevent bloodshed. Eventually, eight of the chiefs agreed to move west but asked to delay the move until the end of the year, and Thompson and Clinch agreed.

Five of the most important of the Seminole chiefs, including Micanopy of the Alachua Seminoles, had not agreed to the move. In retaliation, Thompson declared that those chiefs were removed from their positions. As relations with the Seminoles deteriorated, Thompson forbade the sale of guns and ammunition to the Seminoles. Osceola, a young warrior beginning to be noticed particularly by the white settlers, was particularly upset by the ban, feeling that it equated Seminoles with slaves and said, &quot;The white man shall not make me black. I will make the white man red with blood; and then blacken him in the sun and rain ... and the buzzard live upon his flesh.&quot; In spite of this, Thompson considered Osceola to be a friend and gave him a rifle. Later, though, when Osceola was causing trouble, Thompson had him locked up at Fort King for a night. The next day, in order to secure his release, Osceola agreed to abide by the Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing and to bring his followers in.

The situation grew worse. On 19 June 1835, a group of whites searching for lost cattle found a group of Indians sitting around a campfire cooking the remains of what they claimed was one of their herd. The whites disarmed and proceeded to whip the Indians, when two more arrived and opened fire on the whites. Three whites were wounded, and one Indian was killed and one wounded, at what became known as the skirmish at Hickory Sink. After complaining to Indian Agent Thompson and not receiving a satisfactory response, the Seminoles became further convinced that they would not receive fair compensations for their complaints of hostile treatment by the settlers. Believed to be in response for the incident at Hickory Sink, in August 1835, Private Kinsley Dalton (for whom Dalton, Georgia, is named) was killed by Seminoles as he was carrying the mail from Fort Brooke to Fort King.

Throughout the summer of 1835, the Seminole who had agreed to leave Florida were gathered at Fort King, as well as other military posts. From these gathering places, they would be sent to Tampa Bay where transports would then take them to New Orleans, destined eventually for reservations out west. However, the Seminole ran into issues getting fair prices for the property they needed to sell (chiefly livestock and slaves). Furthermore, there were issues with furnishing the Seminole with proper clothing. These issues led many Seminoles to think twice about leaving Florida.

In November 1835 Chief Charley Emathla, wanting no part of a war, agreed to removal and sold his cattle at Fort King in preparation for moving his people to Fort Brooke to emigrate to the west. This act was considered a betrayal by other Seminoles who months earlier declared in council that any Seminole chief who sold his cattle would be sentenced to death. Osceola met Charley Emathla on the trail back to his village and killed him, scattering the money from the cattle purchase across his body.

==Second Seminole War==

As Florida officials realized the Seminole would resist relocation, preparations for war began. Settlers fled to safety as Seminole attacked plantations and a militia wagon train. Two companies totaling 110 men under the command of Major Francis L. Dade were sent from Fort Brooke to reinforce Fort King in mid-December 1835. On the morning of 28 December, the train of troops was ambushed by a group of Seminole warriors under the command of Alligator near modern-day Bushnell, Florida. The entire command and their small cannon were destroyed, with only two badly wounded soldiers surviving to return to Fort Brooke. Over the next few months Generals Clinch, Gaines and Winfield Scott, as well as territorial governor Richard Keith Call, led large numbers of troops in futile pursuits of the Seminoles. In the meantime, the Seminoles struck throughout the state, attacking isolated farms, settlements, plantations and Army forts, even burning the Cape Florida lighthouse. Supply problems and a high rate of illness during the summer caused the Army to abandon several forts.

On 28 December 1835, Major Benjamine A. Putnam with a force of soldiers occupied the Bulow Plantation and fortified it with cotton bales and a stockade. Local planters took refuge with their slaves. The Major abandoned the site on 23 January 1836, and the Bulow Plantation was later burned by the Seminoles. Now a State Park, the site remains a window into the destruction of the conflict; the massive stone ruins of the huge Bulow sugar mill stand little changed from the 1830s. By February 1836 the Seminole and black allies had attacked 21 plantations along the river.

Major Ethan Allen Hitchcock was among those who found the remains of the Dade party in February. In his journal he wrote of the discovery and expressed his discontent:

The government is in the wrong, and this is the chief cause of the persevering opposition of the Indians, who have nobly defended their country against our attempt to enforce a fraudulent treaty. The natives used every means to avoid a war, but were forced into it by the tyranny of our government.

On 21 November 1836, at the Battle of Wahoo Swamp, the Seminole fought against American allied forces numbering 2500, successfully driving them back.; among the American dead was Major David Moniac, the first Native American graduate of West Point. The skirmish restored Seminole confidence, showing their ability to hold their ground against their old enemies the Creek and white settlers.

Late in 1836, Major General Thomas Jesup, US Quartermaster, was placed in command of the war. Jesup brought a new approach to the war. He concentrated on wearing the Seminoles down rather than sending out large groups who were more easily ambushed. He needed a large military presence in the state to control it, and he eventually brought a force of more than 9,000 men into the state under his command. &quot;Letters went off to the governors of the adjacent states calling for regiments of twelve-months volunteers. In stressing his great need, Jesup did not hesitate to mention a fact harrowing to his correspondents. &quot;This is a negro not an Indian war.&quot; Resulting in about half of the force volunteering as volunteers and militia. It also included a brigade of Marines, and Navy and Revenue-Marine personnel patrolling the coast and inland rivers and streams.
In January 1837, the Army began to achieve more tangible successes, capturing or killing numerous Indians and blacks. At the end of January, some Seminole chiefs sent messengers to Jesup, and arranged a truce. In March a &quot;Capitulation&quot; was signed by several chiefs, including Micanopy, stipulating that the Seminole could be accompanied by their allies and &quot;their negroes, their &quot;bona fide&quot; property&quot;, in their removal to the West. By the end of May, many chiefs, including Micanopy, had surrendered. Two important leaders, Osceola and Sam Jones (a.k.a. Abiaca, Ar-pi-uck-i, Opoica, Arpeika, Aripeka, Aripeika), had not surrendered, however, and were known to be vehemently opposed to relocation. On 2 June these two leaders with about 200 followers entered the poorly guarded holding camp at Fort Brooke and led away the 700 Seminoles who had surrendered. The war was on again, and Jesup decided against trusting the word of an Indian again. On Jesup&#x27;s orders, Brigadier General Joseph Marion Hernández commanded an expedition that captured several Indian leaders, including Coacoochee (Wild Cat), John Horse, Osceola and Micanopy when they appeared for conferences under a white flag of truce. Coacoochee and other captives, including John Horse, escaped from their cell at Fort Marion in St. Augustine, but Osceola did not go with them. He died in prison, probably of malaria.

Jesup organized a sweep down the peninsula with multiple columns, pushing the Seminoles further south. On Christmas Day 1837, Colonel Zachary Taylor&#x27;s column of 800 men encountered a body of about 400 warriors on the north shore of Lake Okeechobee. The Seminole were led by Sam Jones, Alligator and the recently escaped Coacoochee; they were well positioned in a hammock surrounded by sawgrass with half a mile of swamp in front of it. On the far side of the hammock was Lake Okeechobee. Here the saw grass stood five feet high. The mud and water were three feet deep. Horses would be of no use. The Seminole had chosen their battleground. They had sliced the grass to provide an open field of fire and had notched the trees to steady their rifles. Their scouts were perched in the treetops to follow every movement of the troops coming up. As Taylor&#x27;s army came up to this position, he decided to attack.

At about half past noon, with the sun shining directly overhead and the air still and quiet, Taylor moved his troops squarely into the center of the swamp. His plan was to attack directly rather than try to encircle the Indians. All his men were on foot. In the first line were the Missouri volunteers. As soon as they came within range, the Seminoles opened fire. The volunteers broke, and their commander Colonel Gentry, fatally wounded, was unable to rally them. They fled back across the swamp. The fighting in the saw grass was deadliest for five companies of the Sixth Infantry; every officer but one, and most of their noncoms, were killed or wounded. When those units retired a short distance to re-form, they found only four men of these companies unharmed. The US eventually drove the Seminoles from the hammock, but they escaped across the lake. Taylor lost 26 killed and 112 wounded, while the Seminoles casualties were eleven dead and fourteen wounded. The US claimed the Battle of Lake Okeechobee as a great victory.

At the end of January, Jesup&#x27;s troops caught up with a large body of Seminoles to the east of Lake Okeechobee. Originally positioned in a hammock, the Seminoles were driven across a wide stream by cannon and rocket fire and made another stand. They faded away, having inflicted more casualties than they suffered, and the Battle of Loxahatchee was over. In February 1838, the Seminole chiefs Tuskegee and Halleck Hadjo approached Jesup with the proposal to stop fighting if they could stay in the area south of Lake Okeechobee, rather than relocating west. Jesup favored the idea but had to gain approval from officials in Washington for approval. The chiefs and their followers camped near the Army while awaiting the reply. When the secretary of war rejected the idea, Jesup seized the 500 Indians in the camp, and had them transported to the Indian Territory.

In May, Jesup&#x27;s request to be relieved of command was granted, and Zachary Taylor assumed command of the Army in Florida. With reduced forces, Taylor concentrated on keeping the Seminole out of northern Florida by building many small posts at twenty-mile (30 km) intervals across the peninsula, connected by a grid of roads. The winter season was fairly quiet, without major actions. In Washington and around the country, support for the war was eroding. Many people began to think the Seminoles had earned the right to stay in Florida. Far from being over, the war had become very costly. President Martin Van Buren sent the Commanding General of the Army, Alexander Macomb, to negotiate a new treaty with the Seminoles. On 19 May 1839, Macomb announced an agreement. In exchange for a reservation in southern Florida, the Seminoles would stop fighting.

As the summer passed, the agreement seemed to be holding. However, on 23 July, some 150 Indians attacked a trading post on the Caloosahatchee River; it was guarded by a detachment of 23 soldiers under the command of Colonel William S. Harney. He and some soldiers escaped by the river, but the Seminoles killed most of the garrison, as well as several civilians at the post. Many blamed the &quot;Spanish&quot; Indians, led by Chakaika, for the attack, but others suspected Sam Jones, whose band of Mikasuki had agreed to the treaty with Macomb. Jones, when questioned, promised to turn the men responsible for the attack over to Harney in 33 days. Before that time was up, two soldiers visiting Jones&#x27; camp were killed.

The Army turned to bloodhounds to track the Indians, with poor results. Taylor&#x27;s blockhouse and patrol system in northern Florida kept the Seminoles on the move but could not clear them out. In May 1839, Taylor, having served longer than any preceding commander in the Florida war, was granted his request for a transfer and replaced by Brig. Gen. Walker Keith Armistead. Armistead immediately went on the offensive, actively campaigning during the summer. Seeking hidden camps, the Army also burned fields and drove off livestock: horses, cattle and pigs. By the middle of the summer, the Army had destroyed of Seminole crops.

The Navy sent its sailors and Marines up rivers and streams, and into the Everglades. In late 1839 Navy Lt. John T. McLaughlin was given command of a joint Army-Navy amphibious force to operate in Florida. McLaughlin established his base at Tea Table Key in the upper Florida Keys. Traveling from December 1840 to the middle of January 1841, McLaughlin&#x27;s force crossed the Everglades from east to west in dugout canoes, the first group of whites to complete a crossing. The Seminoles kept out of their way.

===Indian Key===
Indian Key is a small island in the upper Florida Keys. In 1840, it was the county seat of the newly created Dade County, and a wrecking port. Early in the morning of 7 August 1840, a large party of &quot;Spanish&quot; Indians snuck onto Indian Key. By chance, one man was up and raised the alarm after spotting the Indians. Of about fifty people living on the island, forty were able to escape. The dead included Dr. Henry Perrine, former United States Consul in Campeche, Mexico, who was waiting at Indian Key until it was safe to take up a 36-square mile (93 km2) grant on the mainland that Congress had awarded to him.

The naval base on the Key was manned by a doctor, his patients, and five sailors under a midshipman. They mounted a couple of cannons on barges to attack the Indians. The Indians fired back at the sailors with musket balls loaded in cannon on the shore. The recoil of the cannon broke them loose from the barges, sending them into the water, and the sailors had to retreat. The Indians looted and burned the buildings on Indian Key. In December 1840, Col. Harney at the head of ninety men found Chakaika&#x27;s camp deep in the Everglades. His force killed the chief and hanged some of the men in his band.

===War winds down===
Armistead received US$55,000 to use for bribing chiefs to surrender. Echo Emathla, a Tallahassee chief, surrendered, but most of the Tallahassee, under Tiger Tail, did not. Coosa Tustenuggee finally accepted US$5,000 for bringing in his 60 people. Lesser chiefs received US$200, and every warrior got US$30 and a rifle. By the spring of 1841, Armistead had sent 450 Seminoles west. Another 236 were at Fort Brooke awaiting transportation. Armistead estimated that 120 warriors had been shipped west during his tenure and that no more than 300 warriors remained in Florida.

In May 1841, Armistead was replaced by Col. William Jenkins Worth as commander of Army forces in Florida. Worth had to cut back on the unpopular war: he released nearly 1,000 civilian employees and consolidated commands. Worth ordered his men out on &quot;search and destroy&quot; missions during the summer and drove the Seminoles out of much of northern Florida.

The Army&#x27;s actions became a war of attrition; some Seminole surrendered to avoid starvation. Others were seized when they came in to negotiate surrender, including, for the second time, Coacoochee. A large bribe secured Coacoochee&#x27;s cooperation in persuading others to surrender.

In the last action of the war, General William Bailey and prominent planter Jack Bellamy led a posse of 52 men on a three-day pursuit of a small band of Tiger Tail&#x27;s braves who had been attacking settlers, surprising their swampy encampment and killing all 24. William Wesley Hankins, at sixteen the youngest of the posse, accounted for the last of the kills and was acknowledged as having fired the last shot of the Second Seminole War.

After Colonel Worth recommended early in 1842 that the remaining Seminoles be left in peace, he received authorization to leave the remaining Seminoles on an informal reservation in southwestern Florida and to declare an end to the war., He announced it on 14 August 1842. In the same month, Congress passed the Armed Occupation Act, which provided free land to settlers who improved the land and were prepared to defend themselves from Indians. At the end of 1842, the remaining Indians in Florida living outside the reservation in southwest Florida were rounded up and shipped west. By April 1843, the Army presence in Florida had been reduced to one regiment. By November 1843, Worth reported that only about 95 Seminole men and some 200 women and children living on the reservation were left, and that they were no longer a threat.

===Aftermath===
The Second Seminole War may have cost as much as $40,000,000. More than 40,000 regular U.S. military, militiamen and volunteers served in the war. This Indian war cost the lives of 1,500 soldiers, mostly from disease. It is estimated that more than 300 regular U.S. Army, Navy and Marine Corps personnel were killed in action, along with 55 volunteers. There is no record of the number of Seminole killed in action, but many homes and Indian lives were lost. A great many Seminole died of disease or starvation in Florida, on the journey west, and after they reached Indian Territory. An unknown but apparently substantial number of white civilians were killed by Seminole during the war.

==Second Interbellum==
Peace had come to Florida. The Indians were mostly staying on the reservation. Groups of ten or so men would visit Tampa to trade. Squatters were moving closer to the reservation, however, and in 1845 President James Polk established a wide buffer zone around the reservation. No land could be claimed within the buffer zone, no title would be issued for land there, and the U.S. Marshal would remove squatters from the buffer zone upon request. In 1845, Thomas P. Kennedy, who operated a store at Fort Brooke, converted his fishing station on Pine Island into a trading post for the Indians. The post did not do well, however, because whites who sold whiskey to the Indians told them that they would be seized and sent west if they went to Kennedy&#x27;s store.

The Florida authorities continued to press for removal of all Indians from Florida. The Indians for their part tried to limit their contacts with whites as much as possible. In 1846, Captain John T. Sprague was placed in charge of Indian affairs in Florida. He had great difficulty in getting the chiefs to meet with him. They were very distrustful of the Army since it had often seized chiefs while under a flag of truce. He did manage to meet with all of the chiefs in 1847, while investigating a report of a raid on a farm. He reported that the Indians in Florida then consisted of 120 warriors, including seventy Seminoles in Billy Bowlegs&#x27; band, thirty Mikasukis in Sam Jones&#x27; band, twelve Creeks (Muscogee speakers) in Chipco&#x27;s band, 4 Yuchis and 4 Choctaws. He also estimated that there were 100 women and 140 children.

===Indian attacks===
The trading post on Pine Island had burned down in 1848, and in 1849 Thomas Kennedy and his new partner, John Darling, were given permission to open a trading post on what is now Paynes Creek, a tributary of the Peace River. One band of Indians was living outside the reservation at this time. Called &quot;outsiders&quot;, it consisted of twenty warriors under the leadership of Chipco, and included five Muscogees, seven Mikasukis, six Seminoles, one Creek and one Yuchi. On 12 July 1849, four members of this band attacked a farm on the Indian River just north of Fort Pierce, killing one man and wounding another man and a woman. The news of this raid caused much of the population of the east coast of Florida to flee to St. Augustine. On 17 July, four of the &quot;outsiders&quot; who had attacked the farm on the Indian River, plus a fifth man who had not been at Indian River, attacked the Kennedy and Darling store. Two workers at the store, including a Captain Payne, were killed, and another worker and his wife were wounded as they escorted their child into hiding.

The U.S. Army was not prepared to engage the Indians. It had few men stationed in Florida and no means to move them quickly to where they could protect the white settlers and capture the Indians. The War Department began a new buildup in Florida, placing Major General David E. Twiggs in command, and the state called up two companies of mounted volunteers to guard settlements. Captain John Casey, who was in charge of the effort to move the Indians west, was able to arrange a meeting between General Twiggs and several of the Indian leaders at Charlotte Harbor. At that meeting, Billy Bowlegs promised, with the approval of other leaders, to deliver the five men responsible for the attacks to the Army within thirty days. On 18 October, Bowlegs delivered three of the men to Twiggs, along with the severed hand of another who had been killed while trying to escape. The fifth man had been captured but had escaped.

After Bowlegs had delivered the three murderers, General Twiggs told the Indians, much to their dismay, that he had been ordered to remove them from Florida. The government would apply three tactics to carry out the removal. The Army in Florida was increased to 1,500 men. One hundred thousand dollars was appropriated for bribing Indians to move. Finally, a delegation of Seminole chiefs was brought from the Indian Territory to negotiate with their counterparts in Florida. Eventually a Mikasuki sub-chief, Kapiktoosootse, agreed to lead his people west. In February 1850, 74 Indians boarded ship for New Orleans. They were paid a total of US$15,953 in bribes and compensation for property left behind in Florida. There were a couple of incidents that soured relations after that. A Muskogee and a Mikasuki who had gone in to trade at the same time as Kapiktoosootse and his band were surrendering were involuntarily shipped off to New Orleans with them. Then, in March a mounted detachment of the Seventh Infantry penetrated far in the reservation. As a result, the other Indians broke off contact with the negotiators. By April, Twiggs was reporting to Washington that there was no hope of convincing any more Indians to move.

In August 1850, an orphan boy living on a farm in north central Florida was apparently killed by Indians. Eventually enough complaints about the incident had reached Washington to cause the secretary of war to order the surrender of the Indians responsible, or the president would hold the whole tribe responsible. Captain Casey was able to get word to Bowlegs and arrange a meeting in April. Bowlegs promised to deliver the men responsible, although they apparently were members of Chipco&#x27;s band, over whom Bowlegs had no authority. Chipco decided to surrender three men as the possible killers, and they were arrested when they showed up to trade in Fort Myers. Once in custody, the three protested their innocence, saying that Chipco did not like them and that other men in Chipco&#x27;s band were the actual killers, and Captain Casey believed them. The three men tried to escape from the jail in Tampa but were caught and chained up in their cell. They were later found hanging from the bars in their cell. One was still alive when found but was not cut down until the next day, after he had died. It was noted in the community that the constable who had chained the three men in their cell was the father-in-law of a brother of one of the men killed at the Kennedy and Darling store in 1849 (the Paynes Creek Massacre).

===Further Indian removal===
In 1851, General Luther Blake was appointed by the Secretary of the Interior Thomas McKean Thompson McKennan to move the Indians west. Blake had successfully removed the Cherokee from Georgia and was presumed capable of the task of removing the Seminole. He had funding to pay every adult male $800 and every woman and child $450. He went to the Indian Territory to find interpreters and returned to Florida in March 1852. Traveling into the field to meet with all of the Indian leaders, by July he had found sixteen Seminole to send west. Finding Billy Bowlegs insistent on staying in Florida, Blake took Bowlegs and several other chiefs to Washington. President Millard Fillmore presented Bowlegs with a medal, and he and three other chiefs were persuaded to sign an agreement promising to leave Florida. The chiefs were taken on a tour that included Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York City. Upon returning to Florida, the chiefs repudiated the agreement they had signed in Washington. Blake was fired in 1853, and Captain Casey was put back in charge of Indian removal.

In January 1851, the Florida Legislature created the position of commander of the Florida Militia, and Governor Thomas Brown appointed General Benjamin Hopkins to it in January 1853 after the Seminole refused to appear for a meeting in Washington. The Florida Militia pursued Seminole who were outside the reservation boundaries. In the period prior to the Third Seminole War, the militia captured one man and a few women, and 140 hogs. One Seminole woman elder committed suicide while being held by the militia, after the rest of her family had escaped. The whole operation cost the state US$40,000.

Pressure from Florida officials pushed the federal government to take action. Captain Casey continued to try to persuade the Seminole to move west without success. He sent Billy Bowlegs and others to Washington again, but the chiefs refused to agree to move. In August 1854, Secretary of War Jefferson Davis initiated a program to force the Seminole into a final conflict. The plan included a trade embargo against them, the survey and sale of land in southern Florida to European-American settlers, and a stronger Army presence to protect the new settlers. Davis said that if the Seminole did not agree to leave, the Army would use force.

==Third Seminole War==

===Increased Army presence and Indian attacks===
By late 1855, there were more than 700 Army troops stationed on the Florida peninsula. In fall of 1855, a group of Seminole gathered near Taylor Creek, on the north-east side of Lake Okeechobee. There it was generally agreed that they would strike back at the increasing pressure being put on them and attack when an opportunity presented itself. According to one account, a warrior named Tiger, possibly Thlocklo Tustenuggee (Tom Tiger), argued in favor of military action while another leader, named Chipco, opposed war. On 7 December 1855, First Lieutenant George Hartsuff, who had led previous patrols into the reservation, left Fort Myers with ten men and two wagons. They found no Seminoles but did pass corn fields and three deserted villages, including Billy Bowlegs&#x27; village. On the evening of 19 December, Hartsuff told his men that they would be returning to Fort Myers the next day. As the men were loading the wagons and saddling their horses the next morning (20 December 1855), forty Seminoles led by Billy Bowlegs attacked the camp. Several soldiers were shot, including Lieutenant Hartsuff, who managed to hide himself. The Seminoles killed and scalped four men in the camp, killed the wagon mules, looted and burned the wagons and took several horses. Seven men, four of them wounded, made it back to Fort Myers.

When the news of the attack reached Tampa, the men of the city elected militia officers and organized companies. The newly formed militia marched to the Peace River valley, recruited more men, and manned some forts along the river. Governor James Broome started organizing as many volunteer companies as he could. Because the state had limited funds, he tried to have the Army accept the volunteers. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis accepted two infantry companies and three mounted companies, about 260 men. Governor Broome kept another 400 men mobilized under state control. The state troops, both those accepted by the Army and those remaining under state control, had been partly armed and supplied by private donations. General Jesse Carter was appointed by Governor Broome as &quot;special agent ... without military rank&quot; to lead the state troops. Carter set half of the state troops to growing crops, and so only 200 of his men were available for patrols. A Tampa newspaper noted that the mounted patrols preferred to patrol in open country, which was easier for the horses, but it allowed the Seminoles to see them coming.

On 6 January 1856, two men gathering coontie south of the Miami River were killed. The settlers in the area promptly fled to Fort Dallas and Key Biscayne. A party of some twenty Seminoles under Ocsen Tustenuggee attacked a wood-cutting patrol outside of Fort Denaud, killing five of the six men. Despite the positioning of militia units to defend the area, the Seminoles also raided along the coast south of Tampa Bay. They killed one man and burned a house in what is now Sarasota, and on 31 March 1856, they tried to attack the &quot;Braden Castle&quot;, the plantation home of Dr. Joseph Braden, in what is now Bradenton. The &quot;Castle&quot; was too strong for them, but they led away seven slaves and three mules. Burdened with prisoners and loot, the Seminoles did not move fast. While they were stopped at Big Charley Apopka Creek eating barbecued beef from a cow they had found and slaughtered, the militia caught up with them. The militiamen killed two of the Seminoles and recaptured the slaves and mules taken from Dr. Braden&#x27;s plantation. The scalp of one of the dead Seminoles was displayed in Tampa, the other in Manatee.

During April, regular Army and militiamen patrolled around and into the reservation but made little contact with the Seminoles. One six-hour battle was fought near Bowlegs Town in April, with four regulars killed and three wounded before the Seminoles withdrew. The Seminoles continued to carry out small raids around the state. On 14 May 1856, fifteen Seminoles attacked the farmhouse of Captain Robert Bradley north of Tampa, killing two of his young children. One Seminole was killed by Bradley. Bradley may have been targeted because he had killed Tiger Tail&#x27;s brother during the Second Seminole War. On 17 May, Seminoles attacked a wagon train in central Florida, killing three men. Mail and stagecoach service in and out of Tampa was suspended until the military could provide protection.

On 14 June 1856, Seminoles attacked the farm of Willoughby Tillis from Fort Meade. All of the household made it safely into the house, and they were able to hold the Seminoles at bay. The gunfire was heard at Fort Meade, and seven mounted militiamen under Lt. Alderman Carlton responded. Three of the militiamen—Lt. Alderman Carlton, Lott Whidden, and William Parker—were killed and two others wounded. More militiamen pursued the Seminoles but had to retreat when a sudden rain wet their powder. On 16 June, twenty militiamen from Fort Fraser surprised a group of Seminoles along the Peace River, killing some of the Seminoles. The militiamen withdrew after losing two dead—Robert F. Prine, and George Howell—and three others wounded. They claimed to have killed as many as twenty Seminoles, but the Indians admitted to only four dead and two wounded. However, one of the dead was Ocsen Tustenuggee, who seems to have been the only chief who would actively lead attacks against settlements.

The citizens of Florida were becoming disenchanted with the militia. There were complaints that the militiamen would pretend to patrol for a day or two and then go home to work their fields, and that they were given to idleness, drunkenness, and thievery. The officers were reported to be unwilling to submit required paperwork. Most importantly, the militia had failed to prevent attacks against settlers.

===New strategy===
In September 1856, Brigadier General William S. Harney returned to Florida as commander of the federal troops. Remembering lessons he had learned in the Second Seminole War, Harney set up a system of forts in a line across Florida, and patrols moved deep into Seminole territory. He planned to confine the Seminoles to the Big Cypress Swamp and the Everglades, because he believed they would be unable to live there during the wet season. He anticipated being able to catch the Indians when they left their flooded sanctuaries seeking dry land for raising their crops. Part of Harney&#x27;s plan involved using boats to reach islands and other dry spots in the swamps. He first made one more attempt to negotiate with the Seminoles but was unable to make contact with them. In early January 1857, he ordered his troops to actively pursue the Indians. Harney&#x27;s plan, however, had shown few results by the time he and the Fifth Infantry were transferred to Kansas to aid in the uprisings there in April.

Colonel Gustavus Loomis replaced General Harney as commander in Florida, but the withdrawal of the Fifth Infantry left him with only ten companies of the Fourth Artillery, which was later reduced to just four companies. Loomis organized volunteers into boat companies, which were given metal &quot;alligator boats&quot; that had been built earlier specifically for use in the Big Cypress Swamp and Everglades. long, pointed at both ends, and drawing two to of water, the boats could carry up to sixteen men into the swamps. These boat companies were able to capture many Indians, primarily women and children. The regulars did not do as well. Some officers, including Captain Abner Doubleday, observed that the Seminoles easily avoided the Army patrols. Doubleday attributed this to the fact that most of the enlisted men were recent immigrants who had no skills in .

In 1857, ten companies of Florida militia were taken into federal service, totaling almost 800 men by September. In November these troops captured eighteen women and children from Billy Bowlegs&#x27; band. The troops also found and destroyed several towns and fields of crops. The troops moved into the Big Cypress Swamp starting on New Year&#x27;s Day 1858, again destroying the towns and cultivated fields they found. Another delegation from the Indian Territory arrived in Florida in January and attempted to contact Bowlegs. The troops stood down while the attempt was made, and Bowlegs was contacted. The previous year the Seminoles had finally been given their own reservation in Indian Territory separate from the Creeks. Cash payments of US$500 to each warrior (more to the chiefs) and $100 to each woman were promised. On 15 March, Bowlegs&#x27; and Assinwar&#x27;s bands accepted the offer and agreed to go west. On 4 May, a total of 163 Seminoles (including some captured earlier) were shipped to New Orleans. On 8 May 1858, Colonel Loomis declared the war to be over.

==Aftermath==
The government believed that only about 100 Seminoles were left in Florida when Colonel Loomis declared an end to the Third Seminole War, but the estimate proved to be too low. In December 1858, the US recruited two bands totaling 75 people, who agreed to removal to the West; they were shipped out on 15 February 1859. Seminoles remained in Florida, however. Sam Jones&#x27; band was living in the eastern edge of the Everglades inland from Fort Lauderdale. Chipco&#x27;s band was thought to be living north of Lake Okeechobee (although the Army had failed to locate them), and smaller family groupings lived on remote patches of higher ground scattered across the wetlands of south Florida.

Since the war was officially over and the remaining Seminole carefully avoided contact with settlers, the government sent the militia home and reassigned most of the regular Army troops, leaving only small contingents in larger coastal forts such as Fort Brooke. Most of the smaller forts scattered across the Florida wilderness were decommissioned and soon stripped by settlers of any usable material.

During the American Civil War, the Confederate government of Florida contacted Sam Jones with promises of aid to keep the Seminole from fighting on the side of the Union. The state did not follow through on its promises, but the Seminole were not interested in fighting another war and remained neutral.

The 1868 Florida Constitution, developed by the Reconstruction legislature, gave the Seminole one seat in the house and one seat in the senate of the state legislature. The Seminole never filled the positions. In 1885, the now redeemer dominated legislature passed a new constitution abolishing the seats reserved for Seminoles and establishing barriers to voter registration and electoral practices that essentially disfranchised most African Americans and minorities. This situation lasted until changes brought about by the civil rights movement, including the Voting Rights Act of 1965, eventually prompting the state of Florida to adopt the current state constitution in 1968.

===Modern times===
A small number of Seminoles continued to live in relative isolation in the Lake Okeechobee and Everglades region into the 20th Century. Flood control and drainage projects beginning in the late 1800s opened up more land for development and significantly altered the natural environment, inundating some areas while leaving some former swamps dry and arable. These projects, along with the completion of the Tamiami Trail which bisected the Everglades in 1928, simultaneously ended old ways of life and introduced new opportunities. A steady stream of white developers and tourists came to the area, and the Seminoles began to work in local farms and ranches and open souvenir stands.

In the 1940s, Seminoles living across the state began moving to reservations and establishing official tribal governments to form ties with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 1957, most Seminoles established formal relations with the US government as the Seminole Tribe of Florida, which is headquartered in Hollywood, Florida, and control the Big Cypress Indian Reservation, Brighton Reservation, Fort Pierce Reservation, Hollywood Reservation, Immokalee Reservation, and Tampa Reservation. This branch of Florida Seminoles began operating bingo halls on reservation land in 1979, and after overcoming several legal challenges by the state, opened gambling casinos in the early 2000s and purchased the Hard Rock Casino brand in 2007.

The Miccosukee branch of the Seminoles held to a more traditional lifestyle in the Everglades region, simultaneously seeking privacy and serving as a tourist attraction, wrestling alligators, selling crafts, and giving eco-tours of their land. They received federal recognition as a separate nation in 1962 and received their own reservation lands, collectively known as the Miccosukee Indian Reservation, including a reservation on the northern border of Everglades National Park, about west of Miami.

Quote: &quot;The greatest lesson of the Second Seminole War shows how a government can lose public support for a war that has simply lasted for too long. As the Army became more deeply involved in the conflict, as the government sent more troops into the theater, and as the public saw more money appropriated for the war, people began to lose their interest. Jesup&#x27;s capture of Osceola, and the treachery he used to get him, turned public sentiment against the Army. The use of blood hounds only created more hostility in the halls of Congress. It did not matter to the American people that some of Jesup&#x27;s deceptive practices helped him achieve success militarily. The public viewed his actions so negatively that he had undermined the political goals of the government.&quot;

To go or not to go, that was the question. Many a brave man lost his life and now sleeps beneath the sod of Florida. And yet neither these nor the heroes who exposed themselves there to so many dangers and suffer[ings], could acquire any military glory in such a war.&quot;

Founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos in Bellevue, Washington, the company originally started as an online marketplace for books but gradually expanded its offerings to include a wide range of product categories, referred to as &quot;The Everything Store&quot;. Today, Amazon is considered one of the Big Five American technology companies, the other four being Alphabet, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.

The company has multiple subsidiaries, including Amazon Web Services, providing cloud computing; Zoox, a self-driving car division; Kuiper Systems, a satellite Internet provider; and Amazon Lab126, a computer hardware R&amp;D provider. Other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for 13.4 billion substantially increased its market share and presence as a physical retailer. Amazon also distributes a variety of downloadable and streaming content through its Amazon Prime Video, MGM+, Amazon Music, Twitch, Audible and Wondery units. It publishes books through its publishing arm, Amazon Publishing, film and television content through Amazon MGM Studios, including the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio, which was acquired in March 2022, and owns Brilliance Audio and Audible, which produce and distribute audiobooks, respectively. Amazon also produces consumer electronics—most notably, Kindle e-readers, Echo devices, Fire tablets, and Fire TVs.

Amazon has a reputation as a disruptor of industries through technological innovation and aggressive reinvestment of profits into capital expenditures. , it is the world&#x27;s largest online retailer and marketplace, smart speaker provider, cloud computing service through AWS, live-streaming service through Twitch, and Internet company as measured by revenue and market share. In 2021, it surpassed Walmart as the world&#x27;s largest retailer outside of China, driven in large part by its paid subscription plan, Amazon Prime, which has close to 200 million subscribers worldwide. It is the second-largest private employer in the United States and the second-largest company in the World and in the U.S. by revenue as of 2024 (after Walmart). As of October 2024, Amazon is the 12th-most visited website in the world and 84% of its traffic comes from the United States. Amazon is also the global leader in research and development spending, with R&amp;D expenditure of US$73 billion in 2022. Amazon has been criticized on various grounds, including but not limited to customer data collection practices, a toxic work culture, censorship, tax avoidance, and anti-competitive practices. 
== History ==
=== 1994–2009 ===
Amazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos after he relocated from New York City to Bellevue, Washington, near Seattle, to operate an online bookstore. Bezos chose the Seattle area for its abundance of technical talent from Microsoft and the University of Washington, as well as its smaller population for sales tax purposes and the proximity to a major book distribution warehouse in Roseburg, Oregon. Bezos also considered several other options, including Portland, Oregon, and Boulder, Colorado. The company, originally named Cadabra, was founded in the converted garage of Bezos&#x27;s house for symbolic reasons and was renamed to Amazon in November 1994. The Amazon website launched for public sales on July 16, 1995, and initially sourced its books directly from wholesalers and publishers.

Amazon went public in May 1997. It began selling music and videos in 1998, and began international operations by acquiring online sellers of books in the United Kingdom and Germany. In the subsequent year, it initiated the sale of a diverse range of products, including music, video games, consumer electronics, home improvement items, software, games, and toys.

In 2002, it launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), which initially focused on providing APIs for web developers to build web applications on top of Amazon&#x27;s ecommerce platform. In 2004, AWS was expanded to provide website popularity statistics and web crawler data from the Alexa Web Information Service. AWS later shifted toward providing enterprise services with Simple Storage Service (S3) in 2006, and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in 2008, allowing companies to rent data storage and computing power from Amazon. In 2006, Amazon also launched the&quot; Fulfillment by Amazon &quot;program, which allowed individuals and small companies (called &quot;third-party sellers&quot;) to sell products through Amazon&#x27;s warehouses and fulfillment infrastructure.

=== 2010–present ===
Amazon purchased the Whole Foods Market supermarket chain in 2017. It is the leading e-retailer in the United States with approximately US$178 billion net sales in 2017. It has over 300 million active customer accounts globally. 

Amazon saw large growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, hiring more than 100,000 staff in the United States and Canada. Some Amazon workers in the US, France, and Italy protested the company&#x27;s decision to &quot;run normal shifts&quot; due to COVID-19&#x27;s ease of spread in warehouses. In Spain, the company faced legal complaints over its policies, while a group of US Senators wrote an open letter to Bezos expressing concerns about workplace safety.

On February 2, 2021, Bezos announced that he would step down as CEO to become executive chair of Amazon&#x27;s board. The transition officially took place on July 5, 2021, with former CEO of AWS Andy Jassy replacing him as CEO. In January 2023, Amazon cut over 18,000 jobs, primarily in consumer retail and its human resources division in an attempt to cut costs.

On November 8, 2023, a plan was adopted for Jeff Bezos to sell approximately 50 million shares of the company over the next year (the deadline for the entire sales plan is January 31, 2025). The first step was the sale of 12 million shares for about $2 billion.

On February 26, 2024, Amazon became a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

On December 19, 2024, Amazon workers, led by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters labor union, went on strike against Amazon in at least four US states, with workers in other facilities in the United States being welcomed to join the strike as well.

== Products and services ==
=== Amazon.com ===
Amazon.com is an e-commerce platform that sells many product lines, including media (books, movies, music, and software), apparel, baby products, consumer electronics, beauty products, gourmet food, groceries, health and personal care products, industrial &amp; scientific supplies, kitchen items, jewelry, watches, lawn and garden items, musical instruments, sporting goods, tools, automotive items, toys and games, and farm supplies and consulting services. Amazon websites are country-specific (for example, amazon.com for the US and amazon.co.uk for UK) though some offer international shipping.

Visits to &quot;amazon.com&quot; grew from 615 million annual visitors in 2008, to more than 2 billion per month in 2022. The e-commerce platform is the 12th most visited website in the world.

In February 2024, Amazon announced its first chatbot was first “Rufus” in the US and in July, it was widely available to all customers in the US.

“Rufus” is now available in the US, India and the UK which helps the shoppers get product recommendations, get shopping list advice, compare products and see what other customers have responded to their specific questions.

Results generated by Amazon&#x27;s search engine are partly determined by promotional fees. The company&#x27;s localized storefronts, which differ in selection and prices, are differentiated by top-level domain and country code:


==== Merchant partnerships ====
In 2000, US toy retailer Toys &quot;R&quot; Us entered into a 10-year agreement with Amazon, valued at $50 million per year plus a cut of sales, under which Toys &quot;R&quot; Us would be the exclusive supplier of toys and baby products on the service, and the chain&#x27;s website would redirect to Amazon&#x27;s Toys &amp; Games category. In 2004, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us sued Amazon, claiming that because of a perceived lack of variety in Toys &quot;R&quot; Us stock, Amazon had knowingly allowed third-party sellers to offer items on the service in categories that Toys &quot;R&quot; Us had been granted exclusivity. In 2006, a court ruled in favor of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, giving it the right to unwind its agreement with Amazon and establish its independent e-commerce website. The company was later awarded $51 million in damages.

In 2001, Amazon entered into a similar agreement with Borders, under which Amazon would comanage Borders.com as a co-branded service. Borders pulled out of the arrangement in 2007, with plans to also launch its own online store.

On October 18, 2011, Amazon.com announced a partnership with DC Comics for the exclusive digital rights to many popular comics, including &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, &quot;Sandman&quot;, and &quot;Watchmen&quot;. The partnership has caused well-known bookstores like Barnes &amp; Noble to remove these titles from their shelves.

In November 2013, Amazon announced a partnership with the United States Postal Service to begin delivering orders on Sundays. The service, included in Amazon&#x27;s standard shipping rates, initiated in metropolitan areas of Greater Los Angeles and New York because of the high-volume and inability to deliver in a timely way, with plans to expand into Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Phoenix by 2014.

In June 2017, Nike agreed to sell products through Amazon in exchange for better policing of counterfeit goods. This proved unsuccessful and Nike withdrew from the partnership in November 2019. Companies including IKEA and Birkenstock also stopped selling through Amazon around the same time, citing similar frustrations over business practices and counterfeit goods.

In September 2017, Amazon ventured with one of its sellers JV Appario Retail owned by Patni Group which has recorded a total income of US$104.44 million (₹759 crore) in financial year 2017–2018.

, Amazon Fresh sold a range of Booths branded products for home delivery in selected areas.

In November 2018, Amazon reached an agreement with Apple Inc. to sell selected products through the service, via the company and selected Apple Authorized Resellers. As a result of this partnership, only Apple Authorized Resellers may sell Apple products on Amazon effective January 4, 2019.

On November 7, 2024, Amazon is reportedly discussing a second multi-billion dollar investment in AI startup Anthropic, following its initial $4 billion investment.

==== Private-label products ====

Amazon sells many products under its own brand names, including phone chargers, batteries, and diaper wipes. The AmazonBasics brand was introduced in 2009, and now features hundreds of product lines, including smartphone cases, computer mice, batteries, dumbbells, and dog crates. Amazon owned 34 private-label brands as of 2019. These brands account for 0.15% of Amazon&#x27;s global sales, whereas the average for other large retailers is 18%. Other Amazon retail brands include Presto!, Mama Bear, and Amazon Essentials.
==== Third-party sellers ====
Amazon derives many of its sales (around 40% in 2008) from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon. Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.

==== Affiliate program ====
Publishers can sign up as affiliates and receive a commission for referring customers to Amazon by placing links to Amazon on their websites if the referral results in a sale. Worldwide, Amazon has &quot;over 900,000 members&quot; in its affiliate programs. In the middle of 2014, the Amazon Affiliate Program is used by 1.2% of all websites and it is the second most popular advertising network after Google Ads. It is frequently used by websites and non-profits to provide a way for supporters to earn them a commission.

Associates can access the Amazon catalog directly on their websites by using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) XML service. A new affiliate product, aStore, allows Associates to embed a subset of Amazon products within another website, or linked to another website. In June 2010, Amazon Seller Product Suggestions was launched to provide more transparency to sellers by recommending specific products to third-party sellers to sell on Amazon. Products suggested are based on customers&#x27; browsing history.

==== Product reviews ====

Amazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product. Reviewers must rate the product on a rating scale from one to five stars. Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicates the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicates that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity. As of December 16, 2020, Amazon removed the ability of sellers and customers to comment on product reviews and purged their websites of all posted product review comments. In an email to sellers, Amazon gave its rationale for removing this feature: &quot;...&quot;the comments feature on customer reviews was rarely used&quot;.&quot; The remaining review response options are to indicate whether the reader finds the review helpful or to report that it violates Amazon policies (abuse). If a review is given enough &quot;helpful&quot; hits, it appears on the front page of the product. In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.

When publishers asked Bezos why Amazon would publish negative reviews, he defended the practice by claiming that Amazon.com was &quot;taking a different approach...we want to make every book available—the good, the bad and the ugly...to let truth loose&quot;.

There have been cases of positive reviews being written and posted by public relations companies on behalf of their clients and instances of writers using pseudonyms to leave negative reviews of their rivals&#x27; works.

==== Amazon sales rank ====
The Amazon sales rank (ASR) indicates the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale. It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a &quot;best sellers list&quot; for the millions of products stocked by Amazon. While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists. Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon&#x27;s lists of &quot;movers and shakers&quot;; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales. For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. However, Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the BookScan service to verified authors. While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm. Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR, though Amazon states:

=== Physical stores ===

In November 2015, Amazon opened a physical Amazon Books store in University Village in Seattle. The store was 5,500 square feet and prices for all products matched those on its website. Amazon opened its tenth physical bookstore in 2017; media speculation at the time suggested that Amazon planned to eventually roll out 300 to 400 bookstores around the country. All of its locations were closed in 2022 along with other retail locations under the &quot;Amazon 4-Star&quot; brand.

== Operations ==
=== Logistics ===
Amazon uses many different transportation services to deliver packages. Amazon-branded services include:
* Amazon Air, a cargo airline for bulk transport, with last-mile delivery handled either by Amazon Flex, Amazon Logistics, or the U.S. Postal Service.
* Amazon Flex, a smartphone app that enables individuals to act as independent contractors, delivering packages to customers from personal vehicles without uniforms. Deliveries include one or two hours Prime Now, same or next day Amazon Fresh groceries, and standard Amazon.com orders, in addition to orders from local stores that contract with Amazon.
* Amazon Logistics, in which Amazon contracts with small businesses (which it calls &quot;Delivery Service Partners&quot;) to perform deliveries to customers. Each business has a fleet of approximately 20–40 Amazon-branded vans, and employees of the contractors wear Amazon uniforms. As of December 2020, it operates in the United States, Canada, Italy, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom.
* Amazon Prime Air is an experimental drone delivery service that delivers packages via drones to Amazon Prime subscribers in select cities.

Amazon directly employs people to work at its warehouses, bulk distribution centers, staffed &quot;Amazon Hub Locker+&quot; locations, and delivery stations where drivers pick up packages. As of December 2020, it is not hiring delivery drivers as employees.

Rakuten Intelligence estimated that in 2020 in the United States, the proportion of last-mile deliveries was 56% by Amazon&#x27;s directly contracted services (mostly in urban areas), 30% by the United States Postal Service (mostly in rural areas), and 14% by UPS. In April 2021, Amazon reported to investors it had increased its in-house delivery capacity by 50% in the last 12 months (which included the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States).

=== Supply chain ===
Amazon first launched its distribution network in 1997 with two fulfillment centers in Seattle and New Castle, Delaware. Amazon has several types of distribution facilities consisting of cross-dock centers, fulfillment centers, sortation centers, delivery stations, Prime now hubs, and Prime air hubs. There are 75 fulfillment centers and 25 sortation centers with over 125,000 employees. Employees are responsible for five basic tasks: unpacking and inspecting incoming goods; placing goods in storage and recording their location; picking goods from their computer recorded locations to make up an individual shipment; sorting and packing orders; and shipping. A computer that records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a key role: employees carry hand-held computers which communicate with the central computer and monitor their rate of progress. Some warehouses are partially automated with systems built by Amazon Robotics.

In September 2006, Amazon launched a program called FBA (Fulfillment By Amazon) whereby it could handle storage, packing and distribution of products and services for small sellers.

=== Ownership ===
The 10 largest shareholder of Amazon in early 2024 were:
=== Finances ===

Amazon.com is primarily a retail site with a sales revenue model; Amazon takes a small percentage of the sale price of each item that is sold through its website while also allowing companies to advertise their products by paying to be listed as featured products. , Amazon.com is ranked eighth on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. In Forbes Global 2000 2023 Amazon ranked 36th.

For the fiscal year 2021, Amazon reported earnings of US$33.36 billion, with an annual revenue of US$469.82 billion, an increase of 21.7% over the previous fiscal cycle. Since 2007 sales increased from 14.835 billion to 469.822 billion, due to continued business expansion.

Amazon&#x27;s market capitalization went over US$1 trillion again in early February 2020 after the announcement of the fourth quarter 2019 results.

=== Corporate culture ===
During his tenure, Jeff Bezos had become renowned for his annual shareholder letters, which have gained similar notability to those of Warren Buffett. These annual letters gave an &quot;invaluable window&quot; into the famously &quot;secretive&quot; company, and revealed Bezos&#x27;s perspectives and strategic focus. A common theme of these letters is Bezos&#x27;s desire to instill customer-centricity (in his words, &quot;customer obsession&quot;) at all levels of Amazon, notably by making all senior executives field customer support queries for a short time at Amazon call centers. He also read many emails addressed by customers to his public email address. One of Bezos&#x27;s most well-known internal memos was his mandate for &quot;all teams&quot; to &quot;expose their data and functionality&quot; through service interfaces &quot;designed from the ground up to be externalizable&quot;. This process, commonly known as a service-oriented architecture (SOA), resulted in mandatory dogfooding of services that would later be commercialized as part of AWS.

===Lobbying===
Amazon lobbies the United States federal government and state governments on multiple issues such as the enforcement of sales taxes on online sales, transportation safety, privacy and data protection and intellectual property. According to regulatory filings, Amazon.com focuses its lobbying on the United States Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Reserve. Amazon.com spent roughly $3.5 million, $5 million and $9.5 million on lobbying, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. In 2019, it spent $16.8 million and had a team of 104 lobbyists.

Amazon.com was a corporate member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) until it dropped membership following protests at its shareholders&#x27; meeting on May 24, 2012.

In 2014, Amazon expanded its lobbying practices as it prepared to lobby the Federal Aviation Administration to approve its drone delivery program, hiring the Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld lobbying firm in June. Amazon and its lobbyists have visited with Federal Aviation Administration officials and aviation committees in Washington, D.C. to explain its plans to deliver packages. In September 2020 this moved one step closer with the granting of a critical certificate by the FAA.

Amazon has attracted criticism for its actions, including: supplying law enforcement with facial recognition surveillance tools; forming cloud computing partnerships with the CIA; leading customers away from bookshops; adversely impacting the environment; placing a low priority on warehouse conditions for workers; actively opposing unionization efforts; remotely deleting content purchased by Amazon Kindle users; taking public subsidies; seeking to patent its 1-Click technology; engaging in anti-competitive actions and price discrimination; and reclassifying LGBTQ books as adult content. Criticism has also concerned various decisions over whether to censor or publish content such as the WikiLeaks website, works containing libel, anti-LGBT merchandise, and material facilitating dog fighting, cockfighting, or pedophile activities. An article published by &quot;Time&quot; in the wake of social media website Parler&#x27;s termination of service by Amazon Web Service highlights the power companies like Amazon now have over the internet. In December 2011, Amazon faced a backlash from small businesses for running a one-day deal to promote its new Price Check app. Shoppers who used the app to check prices in a brick-and-mortar store were offered a 5% discount to purchase the same item from Amazon. Companies like Groupon, eBay and Taap have countered Amazon&#x27;s promotion by offering $10 off from their products.

The company has also faced accusations of putting undue pressure on suppliers to maintain and extend its profitability. One effort to squeeze the most vulnerable book publishers was known within the company as the Gazelle Project, after Bezos suggested, according to Brad Stone, &quot;that Amazon should approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.&quot; In July 2014, the Federal Trade Commission launched a lawsuit against the company alleging it was promoting in-app purchases to children, which were being transacted without parental consent. In 2019, Amazon banned selling skin-lightening products after pushback from Minnesota health and environmental activists. In 2022, a lawsuit filed by state attorney-general Letitia James was dismissed by the New York state court of appeals. After the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon faced criticism for complying, under pressure from the Biden Administration, to &quot;reduce the visibility” of books critical of the COVID-19 vaccine, which was revealed after Rep. Jim Jordan (acting on behalf of the House Judiciary Committee) subpoenaed emails between the company and the Biden Administration.
Amazon Prime has been criticized for its vehicles systemically double parking, blocking bike lanes, and otherwise violating traffic laws while dropping off packages, contributing to traffic congestion and endangering other road users.

Jane Friedman&lt;ref name=&quot;janefriedman/books&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; discovered six listings of books fraudulently using her name, on Amazon and Goodreads. Amazon and Goodreads resisted removing the fraudulent titles until the author&#x27;s complaints went viral on social media, in a blog post titled &quot;I Would Rather See My Books Get Pirated Than This (Or: Why Goodreads and Amazon Are Becoming Dumpster Fires).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;janefriedman/rather-my-books-pirated&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;arstechnica/2023/08/ai-generated-counterfeit-books-amazon&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vice/v7b774&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost/amazon-goodreads&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2024, following years of criticism for providing law enforcement footage in the custody of Ring (a home security company owned by Amazon) without a warrant, Ring has halted this practice. It received cautious praise from privacy-focused organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation for this change.

In February 2025, Sky accused Amazon of not doing enough to prevent the piracy of its sports rights via “jailbroken” Fire Sticks.

<text>Roskilde University (, abbreviated RUC or RU) is a Danish public university founded in 1972 and located in Trekroner in the Eastern part of Roskilde. The university awards bachelor&#x27;s degrees, master&#x27;s degrees, and PhD degrees in a wide variety of subjects within social sciences, the humanities, and natural sciences.

==History==

The university was founded in 1972 and was initially intended as an alternative to the traditional Danish universities which had been the scene of several student uprisings in the late 1960s. The students considered the traditional universities undemocratic and controlled by the professors and wanted more influence as well as more flexible teaching methods.

In the 1970s the university was known for its very liberal education as opposed to the usual lectures provided by the more traditional universities of Copenhagen and Aarhus. The focus was shifted from traditional lectures to group orientated methods and projects rather than traditional exams.

Back in 1972, these educational ideas were both unorthodox and controversial, but the traditional universities in Denmark have now adopted much of the original RU concept themselves, not least the concept of group project work, which is today a recognised academic method. RU can also be said to have brought to Denmark the concepts of interdisciplinarity and less well-defined boundaries between academic fields, which originated in English-language academia.

==Organization and administration==

The university is governed by a board consisting of 9 members: 5 members recruited outside the university form the majority of the board, 1 member is appointed by the scientific staff, 1 member is appointed by the administrative staff, and 2 members are appointed by the university students. The Rector is appointed by the university board. The rector in turn appoints deans and deans appoint heads of departments. There is no faculty senate and faculty is not involved in the appointment of rector, deans, or department heads. Hence the university has no faculty governance.

===Degree programs===
Roskilde University offers higher education at bachelor-, master, and PhD levels within four main areas: humanities, humanistic technologies, social science and science. The traditional educational setup at RU was based on two years of general studies in one of the main scientific areas and four years of specialization. Today, the university follows the general educational structure in Denmark based on three years of bachelor studies qualifying for a two-year master study.

Roskilde University has 4 departments &quot;(institutes)&quot; specializing in very different areas from Mathematics to International Development:
* Department of Communication and Arts (DCA)
* Department of Science and Environment (DSE)
* Department of People and Technology (DPT)
* Department of Social Sciences and Business

The university offers three international bachelor programmes:

* International Bachelor Study Programme in the Humanities
* International Bachelor Study Programme in the Natural Sciences
* International Bachelor Study Programme in Social Science 

==Rankings==
*QS World University Rankings 2015/6: Politics &amp; International Studies, 151-200, Communication &amp; Media Studies, 151-200. 
*Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2017: ranked 501-600 
*Academic Ranking of World Universities 2016: unranked

<text>SS &quot;Great Britain&quot; is a museum ship and former passenger steamship that was advanced for her time. She was the largest passenger ship in the world from 1845 to 1853. She was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806–1859), for the Great Western Steamship Company&#x27;s transatlantic service between Bristol and New York City. While other ships had been built of iron or equipped with a screw propeller, &quot;Great Britain&quot; was the first to combine these features in a large ocean-going ship. She was the first iron steamer to cross the Atlantic Ocean, which she did in 1845, in 14 days.

The ship is in length and has a 3,400-ton displacement. She was powered by two inclined two-cylinder engines of the direct-acting type, with twin cylinders bore, of stroke. She was also provided with secondary masts for sail power. The four decks provided accommodation for a crew of 120, plus 360 passengers who were provided with cabins, and dining and promenade saloons.

When launched in 1843, &quot;Great Britain&quot; was by far the largest vessel afloat. But her protracted construction time of six years (1839–1845) and high cost had left her owners in a difficult financial position, and they were forced out of business in 1846, having spent all their remaining funds refloating the ship after she ran aground at Dundrum Bay in County Down near Newcastle in what is now Northern Ireland, after a navigation error. In 1852 she was sold for salvage and repaired. &quot;Great Britain&quot; later carried thousands of emigrants to Australia from 1852 until being converted to all-sail in 1881. Three years later, she was retired to the Falkland Islands, where she was used as a warehouse, quarantine ship and coal hulk until she was scuttled in 1937, 98 years after being laid down.

In 1970, after &quot;Great Britain&quot; had been abandoned for 33 years, Sir Jack Arnold Hayward, OBE (1923–2015) paid for the vessel to be raised and repaired enough to be towed north through the Atlantic back to the United Kingdom, and returned to the Bristol dry dock where she had been built 127 years earlier. Hayward was a prominent businessman, developer, philanthropist and owner of the English football club Wolverhampton Wanderers. Now listed as part of the National Historic Fleet, &quot;Great Britain&quot; is a visitor attraction and museum ship in Bristol Harbour, with between 150,000 and 200,000 visitors annually.

==Development==

After the initial success of its first liner, of 1838, the Great Western Steamship Company collected materials for a sister ship, tentatively named &quot;City of New York&quot;. The same engineering team that had collaborated so successfully on &quot;Great Western&quot;—Isambard Brunel, Thomas Guppy, Christopher Claxton and William Patterson—was again assembled. This time however, Brunel, whose reputation was at its height, came to assert overall control over the design of the ship—a state of affairs that would have far-reaching consequences for the company. Construction was carried out in a specially adapted dry dock in Bristol, England.
===Adoption of iron hull===

Two chance encounters were profoundly to affect the design of &quot;Great Britain&quot;. In late 1838, John Laird&#x27;s English Channel packet ship &quot;Rainbow&quot;—the largest iron-hulled ship then in service—made a stop at Bristol. Brunel dispatched his associates Christopher Claxton and William Patterson to make a return voyage to Antwerp on &quot;Rainbow&quot; to assess the utility of the new building material. Both men returned as converts to iron-hulled technology, and Brunel scrapped his plans to build a wooden ship and persuaded the company directors to build an iron-hulled ship. &quot;Great Britain&quot;″s builders recognised a number of advantages of iron over the traditional wooden hull. Wood was becoming more expensive, while iron was getting cheaper. Iron hulls were not subject to dry rot or woodworm, and they were also lighter in weight and less bulky. The chief advantage of the iron hull was its much greater structural strength. The practical limit on the length of a wooden-hulled ship is about , after which hogging—the flexing of the hull as waves pass beneath it—becomes too great. Iron hulls are far less subject to hogging so the potential size of an iron-hulled ship is much greater. The ship&#x27;s designers, led by Brunel, were initially cautious in the adaptation of their plans to iron-hulled technology. With each successive draft however, the ship grew ever larger and bolder in conception. By the fifth draft, the vessel had grown to , over larger than any ship then in existence.

===Adoption of screw propulsion===
In early 1840, a second chance encounter occurred, the arrival of the revolutionary at Bristol, the first screw-propelled steamship, completed only a few months before by Francis Pettit Smith&#x27;s Propeller Steamship Company. Brunel had been looking into methods of improving the performance of &quot;Great Britain&quot;″s paddlewheels, and took an immediate interest in the new technology. Smith, sensing a prestigious new customer for his own company, agreed to lend &quot;Archimedes&quot; to Brunel for extended tests. Over several months, Smith and Brunel tested a number of different propellers on &quot;Archimedes&quot; to find the most efficient design, a four-bladed model submitted by Smith.

Having satisfied himself as to the advantages of screw propulsion, Brunel wrote to the company directors to persuade them to embark on a second major design change, abandoning the paddlewheel engines (already half-constructed) for completely new engines suitable for powering a propeller.

Brunel listed the advantages of the screw propeller over the paddlewheel as follows:

* Screw propulsion machinery was lighter in weight, thus improving fuel economy;
* Screw propulsion machinery could be kept lower in the hull, lowering the ship&#x27;s centre of gravity and making it more stable in heavy seas;
* By taking up less room, propeller engines would allow more cargo to be carried;
* Elimination of bulky paddle boxes would lessen resistance through the water, and also allow the ship to manoeuvre more easily in confined waterways;
* The depth of a paddlewheel is constantly changing, depending on the ship&#x27;s cargo and the movement of waves, while a propeller stays fully submerged and at full efficiency at all times;
* Screw propulsion machinery was cheaper.

Brunel&#x27;s arguments proved persuasive, and in December 1840, the company agreed to adopt the new technology. The decision became a costly one, setting the ship&#x27;s completion back by nine months.

Reporting on the ship&#x27;s arrival in New York, in its first issue &quot;Scientific American&quot; opined, &quot;If there is any thing objectionable in the construction or machinery of this noble ship, it is the mode of propelling her by the screw propeller; and we should not be surprised if it should be, ere long, superseded by paddle wheels at the sides.&quot;

==Launch==
The launching or, more accurately, the float-out took place on 19 July 1843. Conditions were generally favourable and diarists recorded that, after a dull start, the weather brightened with only a few intermittent showers. The atmosphere of the day can best be gauged from a report the following day in &quot;The Bristol Mirror&quot;:

Large crowds started to gather early in the day including many people who had travelled to Bristol to see the spectacle. There was a general atmosphere of anticipation as the Royal Emblem was unfurled. The processional route had been cleaned and Temple Street decorated with flags, banners, flowers and ribbons. Boys of the City School and girls of Red Maids were stationed in a neat orderly formation down the entire length of the Exchange. The route was a mass of colour and everybody was out on the streets as it was a public holiday. The atmosphere of gaiety even allowed thoughts to drift away from the problems of political dissension in London.

Prince Albert arrived at 10 a.m. at the Great Western Railway terminus. The royal train, conducted by Brunel himself, had taken two hours and forty minutes from London. There was a guard of honour of members of the police force, soldiers and dragoons and, as the Prince stepped from the train, the band of the Life Guards played works by Labitsky and a selection from the &quot;Ballet of Alma&quot;. Two sections of the platform were boarded off for the reception and it was noted by &quot;The Bristol Mirror&quot; that parts were covered with carpets from the Council House. The Prince Consort, dressed as a private gentleman, was accompanied by his equerry-in-waiting, personal secretary, the Marquess of Exeter, and Lords Wharncliffe, Liverpool, Lincoln and Wellesley.

Introductions were made, followed by the &quot;Address to His Royal Highness the Prince Albert&quot;, by the town clerk, D. Burgess. Honours were then bestowed on him by the Society of Merchant Venturers, and there were speeches from members of the Bristol clergy. The royal party then had breakfast and, after 20 minutes, reappeared to board horse-drawn carriages.

At noon, the Prince arrived at the Great Western Steamship yard only to find the ship already &quot;launched&quot; and waiting for royal inspection. He boarded the ship, took refreshments in the elegantly decorated lounge then commenced his tour of inspection. He was received in the ship&#x27;s banqueting room where all the local dignitaries and their ladies were gathered.

After the banquet and the toasts, he left for the naming ceremony. It had already been decided that the christening would be performed by Clarissa (1790–1868), wife of Philip John Miles (1773–1845) and mother of Bristol&#x27;s MP, Philip William Skinner Miles (1816–1881), a director of the company. She stepped forward, grasped the champagne bottle and swung it towards the bows. Unfortunately, the steam packet &quot;Avon&quot; had started to tow the ship into the harbour and the bottle fell about short of its target and dropped unbroken into the water. A second bottle was rapidly obtained and the Prince hurled it against the iron hull.

In her haste, &quot;Avon&quot; had started her work before the shore warps had been released. The tow rope snapped and, due to the resultant delay, the Prince was obliged to return to the railway station and miss the end of the programme.

===Another extended delay===

Following the launch ceremony, the builders had planned to have &quot;Great Britain&quot; towed to the Avon for her final fitting out. Unfortunately, the harbour authorities had failed to carry out the necessary modifications to their facilities in a timely manner. Exacerbating the problem, the ship had been widened beyond the original plans to accommodate the propeller engines, and her designers had made a belated decision to fit the engines prior to launch, which resulted in a deeper draught.

This dilemma was to result in another costly delay for the company, as Brunel&#x27;s negotiations with the Bristol Dock Board dragged on for months. It was only through the intervention of the Board of Trade that the harbour authorities finally agreed to the lock modifications, which began in late 1844.

After being trapped in the harbour for more than a year, &quot;Great Britain&quot; was, at last, floated out in December 1844, but not before causing more anxiety for her proprietors. After passing successfully through the first set of lock gates, she jammed on her passage through the second, which led to the River Avon. Only the seamanship of Captain Claxton - who after naval service held the position of quay warden (harbour master) at Bristol - enabled her to be pulled back and severe structural damage avoided. The following day an army of workmen, under the direct control of Brunel, took advantage of the slightly higher tide and removed coping stones and lock gate platforms from the Junction Lock, allowing the tug &quot;Samson&quot;, again under Claxton&#x27;s supervision, to tow the ship safely into the Avon that midnight.

==Description==

===General description===

When completed in 1845, &quot;Great Britain&quot; was a revolutionary vessel—the first ship to combine an iron hull with screw propulsion, and at in length and with a 3,400-ton displacement, more than longer and 1,000 tons larger than any ship previously built. Her beam was and her height from keel to main deck, . She had four decks, including the spar (upper) deck, a crew of 120, and was fitted to accommodate a total of 360 passengers, along with 1,200 tons of cargo and 1,200 tons of coal for fuel.

Like other steamships of the era, &quot;Great Britain&quot; was provided with secondary sail power, consisting of one square-rigged and five schooner-rigged masts—a relatively simple sail plan designed to reduce the number of crew required. The masts were of iron, fastened to the spar deck with iron joints, and with one exception, hinged to allow their lowering to reduce wind resistance in the event of a strong headwind. The rigging was of iron cable instead of the traditional hemp, again with a view to reducing wind resistance. Another innovative feature was the lack of traditional heavy bulwarks around the main deck; a light iron railing both reduced weight and allowed water shipped in heavy weather to run unimpeded back to sea.

The hull and single funnel amidships were both finished in black paint, with a single white stripe running the length of the hull highlighting a row of false gunports. The hull was flat-bottomed, with no external keel, and with bulges low on each side amidships which continued toward the stern in an unusual implementation of tumblehome—a result of the late decision to install propeller engines, which were wider at the base than the originally planned paddlewheel engines.

Brunel, anxious to ensure the avoidance of hogging in a vessel of such unprecedented size, designed the hull to be massively redundant in strength. Ten longitudinal iron girders were installed along the keel, running from beneath the engines and boiler to the forward section. The iron ribs were in size. The iron keel plates were an inch thick, and the hull seams were lapped and double riveted in many places. Safety features, which also contributed to the structural strength of the vessel, included a double bottom and five watertight iron bulkheads. The total amount of iron, including the engines and machinery, was 1,500 tons.

===Machinery===
Two giant propeller engines, with a combined weight of 340 tons, were installed amidships. They were built to a modified patent of Brunel&#x27;s father Marc. The engines, which rose from the keel through the three lower decks to a height just below the main deck, were of the direct-acting type, with twin bore, stroke cylinders inclined upward at a 60° angle, capable of developing a total of at 18 rpm. Steam power was provided by three long by high by wide, &quot;square&quot; saltwater boilers, forward of the engines, with eight furnaces each – four at each end.

In considering the gearing arrangement, Brunel had no precedent to serve as a guide. The gearing for &quot;Archimedes&quot;, of the spur-and-pinion type, had proven almost unbearably noisy, and would not be suitable for a passenger ship. Brunel&#x27;s solution was to install a chain drive. On the crankshaft between &quot;Great Britain&quot;″s two engines, he installed an diameter primary gearwheel, which, by means of a set of four massive inverted-tooth or &quot;silent&quot; chains, operated the smaller secondary gear near the keel, which turned the propeller shaft. This was the first commercial use of silent chain technology, and the individual silent chains installed in &quot;Great Britain&quot; are thought to have been the largest ever constructed.

&quot;Great Britain&quot;″s main propeller shaft, built by the Mersey Iron Works, was the largest single piece of machinery. long and in diameter, the shaft was bored with a hole, reducing its weight and allowing cold water to be pumped through to reduce heat. At each end of the main propeller shaft were two secondary coupling shafts: a , diameter shaft beneath the engine, and a screw shaft of in length and with a diameter of at the stern. Total length of the three shafts was , and the total weight 38 tons. The shaft was geared upward at a ratio of 1 to 3, so that at the engines&#x27; normal operating speed of 18 rpm, the propeller turned at a speed of 54 rpm. The initial propeller was a six-bladed &quot;windmill&quot; model of Brunel&#x27;s own design, in diameter and with pitch of .

===Interior===
The interior was divided into three decks, the upper two for passengers and the lower for cargo. The two passenger decks were divided into forward and aft compartments, separated by the engines and boiler amidships.

In the aft section of the ship, the upper passenger deck contained the after or principal saloon, long by wide, which ran from just aft of the engine room to the stern. On each side of the saloon were corridors leading to 22 individual passenger berths, arranged two deep, a total of 44 berths for the saloon as a whole. The forward part of the saloon, nearest the engine room, contained two ladies&#x27; boudoirs or private sitting rooms, which could be accessed without entering the saloon from the 12 nearest passenger berths, reserved for women. The opposite end of the saloon opened onto the stern windows. Broad iron staircases at both ends of the saloon ran to the main deck above and the dining saloon below. The saloon was painted in &quot;delicate tints&quot;, furnished along its length with fixed chairs of oak, and supported by 12 decorated pillars.

Beneath the after saloon was the main or dining saloon, long by wide, with dining tables and chairs capable of accommodating up to 360 people at one sitting. On each side of the saloon, seven corridors opened onto four berths each, for a total number of berths per side of 28, or 56 altogether. The forward end of the saloon was connected to a stewards&#x27; galley, while the opposite end contained several tiers of sofas. This saloon was apparently the ship&#x27;s most impressive of all the passenger spaces. Columns of white and gold, 24 in number, with &quot;ornamental capitals of great beauty&quot;, were arranged down its length and along the walls, while eight Arabesque pilasters, decorated with &quot;beautifully painted&quot; oriental flowers and birds, enhanced the aesthetic effect. The archways of the doors were &quot;tastefully carved and gilded&quot; and surmounted with medallion heads. Mirrors around the walls added an illusion of spaciousness, and the walls themselves were painted in a &quot;delicate lemon-tinted hue&quot; with highlights of blue and gold.

The two forward saloons were arranged in a similar plan to the after saloons, with the upper &quot;promenade&quot; saloon having 36 berths per side and the lower 30, totalling 132. Further forward, separate from the passenger saloons, were the crew quarters. The overall finish of the passenger quarters was unusually restrained for its time, a probable reflection of the proprietors&#x27; diminishing capital reserves. Total cost of construction of the ship, not including £53,000 for plant and equipment to build her, was £117,000—£47,000 more than her original projected price tag of £70,000.

==Service history==

===Transatlantic service===

On 26 July 1845—seven years after the Great Western Steamship Company had decided to build a second ship, and five years overdue—&quot;Great Britain&quot; embarked on her maiden voyage, from Liverpool to New York under Captain James Hosken, with 45 passengers. The ship made the passage in 14 days and 21 hours, at an average speed of  – almost slower than the prevailing record. She made the return trip in days, again an unexceptional time.

Brunel, who prior to commencement of service had substituted a six-bladed &quot;windmill&quot; design of his own for Smith&#x27;s proven four-bladed propeller design, now decided to try to improve the speed by riveting an extra two inches of iron to each propeller blade. On her next crossing to New York, carrying 104 passengers, the ship ran into heavy weather, losing a mast and three propeller blades. On 13 October, she ran aground on the Massachusetts Shoals. She was refloated and after obtaining a supply of coal from the American schooner &quot;David Coffin&quot; resumed her voyage. After repairs in New York, she set out for Liverpool with only 28 passengers and lost four propeller blades during the crossing. By this time, another design flaw had become evident. The ship rolled heavily, especially in calm weather without the steadying influence of the sail, causing discomfort to passengers.

The shareholders of the company again provided further funding to try to solve the problems. The six-bladed propeller was dispensed with and replaced with the original four-bladed, cast iron design. The third mast was removed, and the iron rigging, which had proven unsatisfactory, was replaced with conventional rigging. In a major alteration, two bilge keels were added to each side in an effort to lessen her tendency to roll. These repairs and alterations delayed her return to service until the following year.

In her second season of service in 1846, &quot;Great Britain&quot; successfully completed two round trips to New York at an acceptable speed, but was then laid up for repairs to one of her chain drums, which showed an unexpected degree of wear. Embarking on her third passage of the season to New York, her captain made a series of navigational errors that resulted in her being run hard aground in Dundrum Bay on the northeast coast of Ireland on 22 September. There was no formal inquiry but it has been recently suggested by Dr Helen Doe in her book &#x27;SS Great Britain&#x27; that it was mainly due to the captain not having updated charts, so that he mistook the new St John&#x27;s light for the Calf light on the Isle of Man.

She remained aground for almost a year, protected by temporary measures organised by Brunel and James Bremner. On 25 August 1847, she was floated free at a cost of £34,000 and taken back to Liverpool, but this expense exhausted the company&#x27;s remaining reserves. After languishing in Prince&#x27;s Dock, Liverpool for some time, she was sold to Gibbs, Bright &amp; Co., former agents of the Great Western Steamship Company, for a mere £25,000.

====Refit and return to service====

The new owners decided not merely to give the vessel a total refit; the keel, badly damaged during the grounding, was completely renewed along a length of , and the owners took the opportunity to further strengthen the hull. The old keelsons were replaced and 10 new ones laid, which ran the entire length of the keel. Both the bow and stern were also strengthened by heavy frames of double angle iron.

Reflecting the rapid advances in propeller engine technology, the original engines were removed and replaced with a pair of smaller, lighter and more modern oscillating engines, with cylinders and stroke, built by John Penn &amp; Sons of Greenwich. They were also provided with more support at the base and supported further by the addition of both iron and wood beams running transversely across the hull, which had the added benefit of reducing engine vibration.

The cumbersome chain-drive gearing was replaced with a simpler and by now proven cog-wheel arrangement, although the gearing of the engines to the propeller shaft remained at a ratio of one to three. The three large boilers were replaced with six smaller ones, operating at or twice the pressure of their predecessors. Along with a new cabin on the main deck, the smaller boilers allowed the cargo capacity to be almost doubled, from 1,200 to 2,200 tons.

The four-bladed propeller was replaced by a slightly smaller three-bladed model, and the bilge keels, previously added to reduce the tendency to roll, were replaced by a heavy external oak keel for the same purpose. The five-masted schooner sail-plan was replaced by four masts, two of which were square-rigged. With the refit complete, &quot;Great Britain&quot; went back into service on the New York run. After only one further round trip she was sold again, to Antony Gibbs &amp; Sons, which planned to place her into England–Australia service.

===Australian service===

Antony Gibbs &amp; Sons may have intended to employ &quot;Great Britain&quot; only to exploit a temporary demand for passenger service to the Australian goldfields following the discovery of gold in Victoria in 1851, but she found long-term employment on this route. For her new role, she was given a third refit. Her passenger accommodation was increased from 360 to 730, and her sail plan altered to a traditional three-masted, square-rigged pattern. She was fitted with a removable propeller, which could be hauled up on deck by chains to reduce drag when under sail power alone.

In 1852, &quot;Great Britain&quot; made her first voyage to Melbourne, Australia, carrying 630 emigrants. She excited great interest there, with 4,000 people paying a shilling each to inspect her. She operated on the England–Australia route for almost 30 years, interrupted only by two relatively brief sojourns as a troopship during the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny. Gradually, she earned a reputation as the most reliable of the emigrant ships to Australia and carried the first English cricket team to tour Australia in 1861.

Alexander Reid, writing in 1862, recorded some statistics of a typical voyage. The ship, with a crew of 143, put out from Liverpool on 21 October 1861, carrying 544 passengers (including the English cricket team that was the first to visit Australia), a cow, 36 sheep, 140 pigs, 96 goats and 1,114 chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys. The journey to Melbourne (her ninth) occupied 64 days, during which the best day&#x27;s run was 354 miles and the worst 108. With favourable winds the ship travelled under sail alone, the screw being withdrawn from the water. Three passengers died en route. The captain was John Gray, a Scot, who had held the post since before the Crimean War.

On 8 December 1863, she was reported to have been wrecked on Santiago, Cape Verde Islands whilst on a voyage from London to Nelson, New Zealand. All on board were rescued.

Her passengers and crew witnessed a total solar eclipse in 1865 while passing the coastline of Brazil en route from Australia to England; they were able to observe stars in the daytime.

On 8 October 1868 &quot;The Argus&quot; reported &quot;To-day, at daylight, the fine steamship &quot;Great Britain&quot; will leave her anchorage in Hobson&#x27;s Bay, for Liverpool direct. On this occasion she carries less than her usual complement of passengers, the season not being a favourite one with colonists desiring to visit their native land. &quot;Great Britain&quot;, however, has a full cargo, and carries gold to the value of about £250,000. As she is in fine trim, we shall probably have, in due time, to congratulate Captain Gray on having achieved another successful voyage.&quot; Gray died under mysterious circumstances, going missing overnight during a return voyage from Melbourne, on the night of 25/26 November 1872. On 22 December, she rescued the crew of the British brig &quot;Druid&quot;, which had been abandoned in the Atlantic Ocean. On 19 November 1874, she collided with the British ship &quot;Mysore&quot; in the Sloyne, losing an anchor and sustaining hull damage. &quot;Great Britain&quot; was on a voyage from Melbourne to Liverpool.

===Later history===

 In 1882 &quot;Great Britain&quot; was converted into a sailing ship to transport bulk coal. The work was done by Messrs. C. &amp; E. Grayson, Liverpool. She made her final voyage in 1886, after loading up with coal and leaving Penarth Dock in Wales for San Francisco on 8 February. After a fire on board en route she was found, on arrival at Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands where she ran aground, to be damaged beyond economic repair. She was sold to the Falkland Islands Company and used, afloat, as a storage hulk (coal bunker) until 1937, when she was towed to Sparrow Cove, from Port Stanley, scuttled and abandoned. As a bunker, she coaled the South Atlantic fleet that defeated Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee&#x27;s fleet in the First World War Battle of the Falkland Islands. In the Second World War, some of her iron was scavenged to repair , one of the Royal Navy ships that fought &quot;Graf Spee&quot; and was badly damaged during the Battle of the River Plate.

==Recovery and restoration==

The salvage operation, made possible by several large donations, including from Sir Jack Hayward and Sir Paul Getty, was organised by &#x27;the SS &quot;Great Britain&quot; Project&#x27;, chaired by Richard Goold-Adams. Ewan Corlett conducted a naval architect&#x27;s survey, reporting that she could be refloated. A submersible pontoon, &quot;Mulus III&quot;, was chartered in February 1970. A German tug, &quot;Varius II&quot;, was chartered, reaching Port Stanley on 25 March. By 13 April, after some concern about a crack in the hull, the ship was mounted successfully on the pontoon and the following day the tug, pontoon and &quot;Great Britain&quot; sailed to Port Stanley for preparations for the transatlantic voyage. The voyage (code name &quot;Voyage 47&quot;) began on 24 April, stopped in Montevideo from 2 May to 6 May for inspection, then across the Atlantic, arriving at Barry Docks, west of Cardiff on 22 June. (&quot;Voyage 47&quot; was chosen as the code name because it was on her 47th voyage from Penarth, in 1886, that during a tempest she had sought shelter in the Falklands.) Bristol-based tugs then took over and towed her, still on her pontoon, to Avonmouth Docks.

The ship was then taken off the pontoon, in preparation for her re-entry into Bristol, now truly afloat. On Sunday 5 July, amidst considerable media interest, the ship was towed up the River Avon to Bristol. Perhaps the most memorable moment for the crowds that lined the final few miles was her passage under the Clifton Suspension Bridge, another Brunel design. She waited for two weeks in the Cumberland Basin for a tide high enough to get her back through the locks to the Floating Harbour and her birthplace, the dry dock in the Great Western Dockyard (now a Grade II* listed building, disused since bomb damage in the Second World War).

The recovery and subsequent voyage from the Falklands to Bristol were depicted in the 1970 BBC &quot;Chronicle&quot; programme, &quot;The Great Iron Ship&quot;.

The original intent was to restore her to her 1843 state. However, the philosophy changed and the conservation of all surviving pre-1970 material became the aim. In 1984 the SS &quot;Great Britain&quot; was designated as a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the fourth such designation outside the US.

By 1998, an extensive survey discovered that the hull was continuing to corrode in the humid atmosphere of the dock and estimates gave her 25 years before she corroded away. Extensive conservation work began which culminated in the installation of a glass plate across the dry dock at the level of her water line, with two dehumidifiers, keeping the space beneath at 20% relative humidity, sufficiently dry to preserve the surviving material. This being completed, the ship was &quot;re-launched&quot; in July 2005, and visitor access to the dry dock was restored. The site is visited by over 150,000 visitors a year with a peak in numbers in 2006 when 200,000 people visited.

===Awards===
The engineers Fenton Holloway won the IStructE Award for Heritage Buildings in 2006 for the restoration of &quot;Great Britain&quot;. In May of that year, the ship won the prestigious Gulbenkian Prize for museums and galleries, now known as Museum of the Year. The chairman of the judging panel, Professor Robert Winston, commented:

The project won The Crown Estate Conservation Award in 2007, and the European Museum of the Year Awards Micheletti Prize for &#x27;Best Industrial or Technology Museum&#x27;. In 2008 the educational value of the project was honoured by the Sandford Award for Heritage Education.

===Being Brunel===
Being Brunel is a museum dedicated to Isambard Kingdom Brunel and built on the harbour next to his ship. Opened in 2018, it holds thousands of Brunel-related items, such as his school reports, his diaries and his technical drawing instruments. Costing £2 million, it occupies buildings on the quayside including Brunel&#x27;s drawing office. It includes a reconstruction of his dining room from Duke Street, and the drawing office has been restored to its 1850 condition.

==Popular culture==

&quot;Great Britain&quot; featured in several television specials.
*The ITV1 series &quot;The West Country Tonight&quot;, in July 2010, told five aspects of the Great Britain&#x27;s story: her history, her restoration and Bristolians&#x27; memories of her return to the city, showing their home footage of the event. Correspondent Robert Murphy travelled to Grand Bahama for an exclusive interview with Sir Jack Hayward, then moved to the Falkland Islands where he spoke with islanders who worked in the salvage team.
*A BBC West documentary called &quot;When Brunel&#x27;s Ship Came Home&quot; tells the story of the salvage operation and was broadcast on BBC One in the West of England on 12 July 2010. It includes memories of many of the people who were involved.
*A 15-minute animated short film called &quot;The Incredible Journey&quot; produced with the University of the West of England tells the story of the ship&#x27;s return to Bristol from the Falklands in 1970.
* In 2015 it was announced that the new British passport would include an image of the SS &quot;Great Britain&quot; on a page of Iconic Innovations.
*The Living TV series &quot;Most Haunted&quot; went on the ship in 2009.

<doc id="90461" wikidata="Q378157" url="?curid=90461" title="Edwin Lutyens">
<text>Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens ( ; 29 March 1869 – 1 January 1944) was an English architect known for imaginatively adapting traditional architectural styles to the requirements of his era. He designed many English country houses, war memorials and public buildings. In his biography, the writer Christopher Hussey wrote, &quot;In his lifetime (Lutyens) was widely held to be our greatest architect since Wren if not, as many maintained, his superior&quot;. The architectural historian Gavin Stamp described him as &quot;surely the greatest British architect of the twentieth (or of any other) century&quot;.

Lutyens played an instrumental role in the construction of New Delhi, which would later on serve as the seat of the Government of India. In recognition of his contribution, New Delhi is also known as &quot;Lutyens&#x27; Delhi&quot;. In collaboration with Sir Herbert Baker, he was also the main architect of several monuments in New Delhi such as the India Gate; he also designed the Viceroy&#x27;s House, which is now known as the Rashtrapati Bhavan.
Many of his works were inspired by Indian architecture. He was elected Master of the Art Workers&#x27; Guild in 1933.

== Early life ==
Lutyens was born in Kensington, London, the tenth of thirteen children of Mary Theresa Gallwey (1832/33–1906) from Killarney, Ireland, and Captain Charles Augustus Henry Lutyens (1829–1915), a soldier and painter. His sister, Mary Constance Elphinstone Lutyens (1868–1951), wrote novels under her married name of Mrs George Wemyss. He grew up in Thursley, Surrey. He was named after a friend of his father, the painter and sculptor Edwin Henry Landseer. Lutyens studied architecture at South Kensington School of Art, London, from 1885 to 1887. After college he joined the Ernest George and Harold Peto architectural practice. It was here that he first met Sir Herbert Baker. For many years he worked from offices at 29 Bloomsbury Square, London.

==Architectural career==
===Private practice===
He began his own practice in 1888, his first commission being a private house at Crooksbury, Farnham, Surrey. During this work, he met the garden designer and horticulturalist Gertrude Jekyll. In 1896 he began work on a house for Jekyll at Munstead Wood near Godalming, Surrey. It was the beginning of a professional partnership that would define the look of many Lutyens country houses.

The &quot;Lutyens–Jekyll&quot; garden had hardy shrubbery and herbaceous plantings within a structural architecture of stairs and balustraded terraces. This combined style, of the formal with the informal, exemplified by brick paths, herbaceous borders, and with plants such as lilies, lupins, delphiniums and lavender, was in contrast to the formal bedding schemes favoured by the previous generation in the 19th century. This &quot;natural&quot; style was to define the &quot;English garden&quot; until modern times.

Lutyens&#x27;s fame grew largely through the popularity of the new lifestyle magazine &quot;Country Life&quot; created by Edward Hudson, which featured many of his house designs. Hudson was a great admirer of Lutyens&#x27;s style and commissioned Lutyens for a number of projects, including Lindisfarne Castle and the &quot;Country Life&quot; headquarters building in London, at 8 Tavistock Street. One of his assistants in the 1890s was Maxwell Ayrton.

By the turn of the century, Lutyens was recognised as one of architecture&#x27;s coming men. In his major study of English domestic buildings, &quot;Das englische Haus&quot;, published in 1904, Hermann Muthesius wrote of Lutyens, &quot;He is a young man who has come increasingly to the forefront of domestic architects and who may soon become the accepted leader among English builders of houses&quot;.

=== Works ===

The bulk of Lutyens&#x27;s early work consisted of private houses in an Arts and Crafts style, strongly influenced by Tudor architecture and the vernacular styles of south-east England. This was the most innovative phase of his career. Important works of this period include Munstead Wood, Tigbourne Court, Orchards and Goddards in Surrey, Deanery Garden and Folly Farm in Berkshire, Overstrand Hall in Norfolk and Le Bois des Moutiers in France.

After about 1900 this style gave way to a more conventional Classicism, a change of direction which had a profound influence on wider British architectural practice. His commissions were of a varied nature from private houses to two churches for the new Hampstead Garden Suburb in London to Julius Drewe&#x27;s Castle Drogo near Drewsteignton in Devon and on to his contributions to India&#x27;s new imperial capital, New Delhi (where he worked as chief architect with Herbert Baker and others). Here he added elements of local architectural styles to his classicism, and based his urbanisation scheme on Mughal water gardens. He also designed the Hyderabad House for the last Nizam of Hyderabad, as his Delhi palace and planned the layout for the Janpath and Rajpath roads.

Before the end of World War I, he was appointed one of three principal architects for the Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission) and was involved with the creation of many monuments to commemorate the dead. Larger cemeteries have a Stone of Remembrance, designed by him. The best known of these monuments are The Cenotaph in Whitehall, Westminster, and the Memorial to the Missing of the Somme, Thiepval. The Cenotaph was originally commissioned by David Lloyd George as a temporary structure to be the centrepiece of the Allied Victory Parade in 1919. Lloyd George proposed a catafalque, a low empty platform, but it was Lutyens&#x27;s idea for the taller monument. The design took less than six hours to complete. Lutyens also designed many other war memorials, and others are based on or inspired by Lutyens&#x27;s designs. Examples of Lutyens&#x27;s other war memorials include the War Memorial Gardens in Dublin, the Tower Hill memorial, the Manchester Cenotaph and the Arch of Remembrance memorial in Leicester.
Lutyens also refurbished Lindisfarne Castle for its wealthy owner.

One of Lutyens&#x27;s smaller works, but considered one of his masterpieces, is The Salutation, a house in Sandwich, Kent, England. Built in 1911–1912 with a garden, it was commissioned by Henry Farrer, one of three sons of Sir William Farrer.

Lutyens heavily influenced Sigurd Frosterus when he designed Vanajanlinna Manor in Finland. 
He was knighted in 1918 and elected a Royal Academician in March 1920. In 1924, he was appointed a member of the newly created Royal Fine Art Commission, a position he held until his death.

While work continued in New Delhi, Lutyens received other commissions including several commercial buildings in London and the Embassy of the United Kingdom in Washington, D.C..

In 1924 he completed the supervision of the construction of what is perhaps his most popular design: Queen Mary&#x27;s Dolls&#x27; House. This four-storey Palladian villa was built in 1/12 scale and is now a permanent exhibit in the public area of Windsor Castle. It was not conceived or built as a plaything for children; its goal was to exhibit the finest British craftsmanship of the period.

Lutyens was commissioned in 1929 to design a new Roman Catholic cathedral in Liverpool. He planned a vast building of brick and granite, topped with towers and a dome, with commissioned sculpture work by Charles Sargeant Jagger and W. C. H. King. Work on this building started in 1933, but was halted during World War II. After the war, the project ended due to a shortage of funding, with only the crypt completed. A model of Lutyens&#x27;s unrealised building was given to and restored by the Walker Art Gallery in 1975 and is now on display in the Museum of Liverpool. The architect of the present Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral, which was built over part of the crypt and consecrated in 1967, was Sir Frederick Gibberd.

In 1945, a year after his death, &quot;A Plan for the City &amp; County of Kingston upon Hull&quot; was published. Lutyens worked on the plan with Sir Patrick Abercrombie and they are credited as its co-authors. Abercrombie&#x27;s introduction in the plan makes special reference to Lutyens&#x27;s contribution. The plan was, however, rejected by Hull City Council. He was also involved in the Royal Academy&#x27;s planning for post-war London, an endeavour dismissed by Osbert Lancaster as &quot;... not unlike what the new Nuremberg might have been had the Führer enjoyed the inestimable advantage of the advice and guidance of the late Sir Aston Webb&quot;.

===Overseas commissions===
====Ireland (1906–1918)====
Works in Ireland include the Irish National War Memorial Gardens in Islandbridge in Dublin, which consists of a bridge over the railway and a bridge over the River Liffey (unbuilt) and two tiered sunken gardens; Heywood House Gardens, County Laois (open to the public), consisting of a hedge garden, lawns, tiered sunken garden and a belvedere; extensive changes and extensions to Lambay Castle, Lambay Island, near Dublin, consisting of a circular battlement enclosing the restored and extended castle and farm building complex, upgraded cottages and stores near the harbour, a real tennis court, a large guest house (The White House), a boathouse and a chapel; alterations and extensions to Howth Castle, County Dublin; the unbuilt Hugh Lane gallery straddling the River Liffey on the site of the Ha&#x27;penny Bridge and the unbuilt Hugh Lane Gallery on the west side of St Stephen&#x27;s Green; and Costelloe Lodge at Casla (also known as Costelloe), County Galway (that was used for refuge by J. Bruce Ismay, the Chairman of the White Star Line, following the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;). In 1907, Lutyens designed Tranarossan House, located just north of Downings on the Rosguill Peninsula on the north coast of County Donegal. The house was built of local granite for Mr and Mrs Phillimore, from London, as a holiday home. In 1937, Mrs Phillimore donated it to &quot;An Óige&quot; (Irish Youth Hostels Association) for the &quot;youth of Ireland&quot;, and it has been a hostel ever since.

==== India (1912–1930) ====

Largely designed by Lutyens over 20 or so years (1912 to 1930), New Delhi, situated within the metropolis of Delhi, popularly known as &#x27;Lutyens&#x27; Delhi&#x27;, was chosen to replace Calcutta as the seat of the British Indian government in 1911; the project was completed in 1929 and officially inaugurated in 1931. In undertaking this project, Lutyens invented his own new order of classical architecture, which has become known as the Delhi Order and was used by him for several designs in England, such as Campion Hall, Oxford. Unlike the more traditional British architects who came before him, he was both inspired by and incorporated various features from the local and traditional Indian architecture—something most clearly seen in the great drum-mounted Buddhist dome of Viceroy&#x27;s House, now Rashtrapati Bhavan. This palatial building, containing 340 rooms, is built on an area of some and incorporates a private garden also designed by Lutyens. The building was designed as the official residence of the Viceroy of India and is now the official residence of the President of India.

The Delhi Order columns at the front entrance of the palace have bells carved into them, which, it has been suggested, Lutyens had designed with the idea that as the bells were silent the British rule would never come to an end. At one time, more than 2,000 people were required to care for the building and serve the Viceroy&#x27;s household.

The new city contains both the Parliament buildings and government offices (many designed by Herbert Baker) and was built distinctively of the local red sandstone using the traditional Mughal style.

When composing the plans for New Delhi, Lutyens planned for the new city to lie southwest of the walled city of Shahjahanbad. His plans for the city also laid out the street plan for New Delhi consisting of wide tree-lined avenues.

Built in the spirit of British colonial rule, the place where the new imperial city and the older native settlement met was intended to be a market. It was there that Lutyens imagined the Indian traders would participate in &quot;the grand shopping centre for the residents of Shahjahanabad and New Delhi&quot;, thus giving rise to the D-shaped market seen today.

Many of the garden-ringed villas in the Lutyens&#x27; Bungalow Zone (LBZ)—also known as Lutyens&#x27; Delhi—that were part of Lutyens&#x27;s original scheme for New Delhi are under threat due to the constant pressure for development in Delhi. The LBZ was placed on the 2002 World Monuments Fund Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites. None of the bungalows in the LBZ were designed by Lutyens—he only designed the four bungalows in the Presidential Estate surrounding Rashtrapati Bhavan at Willingdon Crescent, now known as Mother Teresa Crescent. Other buildings in Delhi that Lutyens designed include Baroda House, Bikaner House, Hyderabad House, and Patiala House.

In recognition of his architectural accomplishments for the British Raj, Lutyens was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE) on 1 January 1930. As a chivalric order, the KCIE knighthood held precedence over his earlier bachelor knighthood.

A bust of Lutyens in the former Viceroy&#x27;s House is the only statue of a Westerner left in its original position in New Delhi. Lutyens&#x27;s work in New Delhi is the focus of Robert Grant Irving&#x27;s book &quot;Indian Summer&quot;.

In spite of his monumental work in India, Lutyens believed that the peoples of the Indian sub-continent were less civilised and less intelligent than Europeans, although these views were common at the time among many of his contemporaries. He thought the Indian Indo-Saracenic style was &quot;formless, not of carved decoration, an anathema...hardly qualified as architecture at all.&quot; Endless battles were fought between him and Viceroy Hardinge over architectural style: Lutyens wanted classical, the architecture of the Empire – Hardinge wanted elements of the Indian vernacular for political and cultural reasons. A firm supporter of British imperialism he built the Viceroy&#x27;s Palace as a symbol of glory of the Raj, and considered Indians to be primitive as yet on the verge of civilization, thereby deserving to be ruled by the British.

==== Spain (1915–1928)====
In Madrid, Lutyens&#x27;s work can be seen in the interiors of the Liria Palace, a neoclassical building which was severely damaged during the Spanish Civil War. The palace was originally built in the 18th century for James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick, and still belongs to his descendants. Lutyens&#x27;s reconstruction was commissioned by Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart, 17th Duke of Alba. The Duke had been in contact with Lutyens while serving as the Spanish ambassador to the Court of St. James&#x27;s.

Between 1915 and 1928, Lutyens also produced designs for a new palace for the Duke of Alba&#x27;s younger brother, Hernando Fitz-James Stuart, 18th Duke of Peñaranda. The palace of El Guadalperal, as it was to be called, would have been, if built, Edwin Lutyens&#x27;s largest country house.
== Personal life ==
Lutyens married Lady Emily Bulwer-Lytton (1874–1964) on 4 August 1897 at Knebworth, Hertfordshire. She was third daughter of Edith (née Villiers) and the 1st Earl of Lytton, a former Viceroy of India. Lady Emily had proposed to Lutyens two years before the wedding, and her parents disapproved of the marriage. Their marriage was largely unsatisfactory, practically from the start, with Lady Emily developing interests in theosophy, Eastern religions, and being drawn both emotionally and philosophically to Jiddu Krishnamurti. They had five children:

* Barbara Lutyens (1898–1981), second wife of Euan Wallace (1892–1941), Minister of Transport.
* Robert Lutyens (1901–1971), interior designer. Designed the façade used for over 40 Marks &amp; Spencer stores.
* Ursula Lutyens (1904–1967), wife of the 3rd Viscount Ridley. They were the parents of the 4th Viscount Ridley (1925–2012), and of the Cabinet Minister Nicholas Ridley (1929–1993). Nicholas Ridley was the father of Edwin Lutyens&#x27;s biographer, Jane Ridley.
* (Agnes) Elisabeth Lutyens (1906–1983), a well-known composer. Second marriage to the conductor Edward Clark.
* (Edith Penelope) Mary Lutyens (1908–1999), a writer known for her books about the philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti.

During the later years of his life, Lutyens suffered with several bouts of pneumonia.

==Death==
In the early 1940s he was diagnosed with cancer. He died on 1 January 1944 and was cremated at East Finchley Crematorium in north London, also known as St Marylebone Crematorium. His ashes were interred in the crypt of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, beneath a memorial designed by his friend and fellow architect William Curtis Green.

== Recognition and legacy ==
Lutyens received the RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 1921, and the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal in 1925. In November 2015 the British government announced that all 44 of Lutyens&#x27;s surviving First World War memorials in Britain had now been listed on the advice of Historic England, and were therefore all protected by law. This involved the one remaining memorial—the Gerrards Cross Memorial Building in Buckinghamshire—being added to the list, plus a further fourteen having their statuses upgraded. For the Imperial Tobacco Company&#x27;s First World War memorial, installed in 1921 at its Bedminster Head Office, this protection arrived too late to prevent its destruction following the company&#x27;s take-over in 1986 by Hanson Trust plc.

The architectural critic Ian Nairn wrote of Lutyen&#x27;s Surrey &quot;masterpieces&quot; in the 1971 &quot;Surrey&quot; volume of the &quot;Buildings of England&quot; series, while noting that; &quot;the genius and the charlatan were very close together in Lutyens&quot;. In the introduction to the catalogue for the 1981 Lutyens exhibition at the Hayward Gallery, the architectural writer Colin Amery described Lutyens as &quot;the builder of some of our finest country houses and gardens&quot;.

In 2015 a memorial to Lutyens by the sculptor Stephen Cox was erected in Apple Tree Yard, Mayfair, London, adjacent to the studio where Lutyens prepared the designs for New Delhi.

<text>In number theory, a super-Poulet number is a Poulet number, or pseudoprime to base 2, whose every divisor formula_1 divides formula_2.

For example, 341 is a super-Poulet number: it has positive divisors (1, 11, 31, 341), and we have:
:(211 - 2) / 11 = 2046 / 11 = 186
:(231 - 2) / 31 = 2147483646 / 31 = 69273666
:(2341 - 2) / 341 = 13136332798696798888899954724741608669335164206654835981818117894215788100763407304286671514789484550

When formula_3 is not prime, then it and every divisor of it are a pseudoprime to base 2, and a super-Poulet number.
The super-Poulet numbers below 10,000 are :

== Super-Poulet numbers with 3 or more distinct prime divisors ==

It is relatively easy to get super-Poulet numbers with 3 distinct prime divisors. If you find three Poulet numbers with three common prime factors, you get a super-Poulet number, as you built the product of the three prime factors.

Example:
2701 = 37 * 73 is a Poulet number, 
4033 = 37 * 109 is a Poulet number, 
7957 = 73 * 109 is a Poulet number;

so 294409 = 37 * 73 * 109 is a Poulet number too.

Super-Poulet numbers with up to 7 distinct prime factors you can get with the following numbers:

*{ 103, 307, 2143, 2857, 6529, 11119, 131071 }
*{ 709, 2833, 3541, 12037, 31153, 174877, 184081 }
*{ 1861, 5581, 11161, 26041, 37201, 87421, 102301 }
*{ 6421, 12841, 51361, 57781, 115561, 192601, 205441 }

For example, 1118863200025063181061994266818401 = 6421 * 12841 * 51361 * 57781 * 115561 * 192601 * 205441 is a super-Poulet number with 7 distinct prime factors and 120 Poulet numbers.

The Shrine of Our Lady of Pompei, dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary, has become a site for Catholic pilgrimages in recent years. It houses a canvas by Luca Giordano. It was founded by a convert who reportedly experienced a miracle from the Virgin Mary. Miracles have been reported since its foundation. The ex-votos that cover the walls of the church are a testimonial of the miracles granted by the Virgin Mary since the church was consecrated in 1891. Many churches, chapels, and shrines around the world are dedicated to Our Lady of Pompei.

===The bell tower===
The bell tower was built between 1912 and 1925. Designed by Aristide Leonori and his brother Pio Leonori, it is 80 metres high (260 ft).

<doc id="90469" wikidata="Q200481" url="?curid=90469" title="Blasphemy">
<text>Blasphemy refers to an insult that shows contempt, disrespect or lack of reverence concerning a deity, an object considered sacred, or something considered inviolable. Some religions, especially Abrahamic ones, regard blasphemy as a crime, including insulting the Islamic prophet Muhammad in Islam, speaking the sacred name in Judaism, and blasphemy of God&#x27;s Holy Spirit is an eternal sin in Christianity. It was also a crime under English common law, and it is still a crime under Italian law (Art. 724 del Codice Penale).

In the early history of the Church, blasphemy &quot;was considered to show active disrespect to God and to involve the use of profane cursing or mockery of his powers&quot;. In the medieval world, those who committed blasphemy were seen as needing discipline. By the 17th century, several historically Christian countries had legislation against blasphemy. Blasphemy was proscribed speech in the U.S. until well into the 20th century. Blasphemy laws were abolished in England and Wales in 2008, and in Ireland in 2020. Scotland repealed its blasphemy laws in 2021. Many other countries have abolished blasphemy laws including Denmark, the Netherlands, Iceland, Norway and New Zealand. , 40 percent of the world&#x27;s countries still had blasphemy laws on the books, including 18 countries in the Middle East and North Africa, or 90% of countries in that region. Indian religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism have no concept of blasphemy and hence prescribe no punishment.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;&quot; came via Middle English and Old French and Late Latin from Greek , from βλασ, &quot;injure&quot; and φήμη, &quot;utterance, talk, speech&quot;. From &quot;blasphemare&quot; also came Old French , from which the English word &quot;blame&quot; came. Blasphemy: &#x27;from Gk. blasphemia &quot;a speaking ill, impious speech, slander,&quot; from blasphemein &quot;to speak evil of.&quot; &quot;In the sense of speaking evil of God this word is found in Ps. 74:18; Isa. 52:5; Rom. 2:24; Rev. 13:1, 6; 16:9, 11, 21. It denotes also any kind of calumny, or evil-speaking, or abuse (1 Kings 21:10 LXX; Acts 13:45; 18:6, etc.).&quot;

==History==

===Middle Ages===
Heresy received more attention than blasphemy throughout the Middle Ages because it was considered a more serious threat to Orthodoxy, while blasphemy was mostly seen as irreverent remarks made by persons who may have been drunk or diverged from good standards of conduct in isolated incidents of misbehavior. When the fundamental understanding of the sacred became more contentious during the Reformation, blasphemy started to be regarded as similar to heresy.

The intellectual culture of the early English Enlightenment embraced ironic or scoffing tones in contradistinction to the idea of sacredness in revealed religion. The characterization of &quot;scoffing&quot; as blasphemy was defined as profaning the Scripture by irreverent &quot;Buffoonery and Banter&quot;. From at least the 18th century on, the clergy of the Church of England justified blasphemy prosecutions by distinguishing &quot;sober reasoning&quot; from mockery and scoffing. Religious doctrine could be discussed &quot;in a calm, decent and serious way&quot; (in the words of Bishop Gibson) but mockery and scoffing, they said, were appeals to sentiment, not to reason.

===Common law===
It was a common law crime according to William Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;:

Blasphemy against the Almighty is denying his being or providence, or uttering conteumelious reproaches on our Savior Christ. It is punished, at common law by fine and imprisonment, for Christianity is part of the laws of the land&quot;.

In 1636, the Puritan-controlled Massachusetts Bay Colony made blasphemy – defined as &quot;a cursing of God by atheism, or the like&quot; – punishable by death. The last person hanged for blasphemy in Great Britain was Thomas Aikenhead aged 20, in Scotland in 1697. He was prosecuted for denying the veracity of the Old Testament and the legitimacy of Christ&#x27;s miracles.

In the United States, blasphemy was recognized as proscribed speech well into the 20th-century. The Constitution entailed a right to articulate views on religion, but not to commit blasphemy, with the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; stating, &quot;The English common law had punished blasphemy as a crime, while excluding &quot;disputes between learned men upon particular controverted points&quot; from the scope of criminal blasphemy. Looking to this precedent, 19th-century American appellate courts consistently upheld proscriptions on blasphemy, drawing a line between punishable blasphemy and protected religious speech.&quot;

The common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were repealed in England &amp; Wales by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. In the 18th and 19th centuries, this meant that promoting atheism could be prosecuted. The last successfully prosecuted case was &quot;Whitehouse v. Lemon&quot; (1976) where the court repeated what had by then become a textbook standard for blasphemy law cases in the UK:

It is not blasphemous to speak or publish opinions hostile to the Christian religion, or to deny the existence of God, if the publication is couched in decent and temperate language. The test to be applied is as to the manner in which the doctrines are advocated and not as to the substance of the doctrines themselves.

The common law offense of blasphemy was abolished in Scotland via the Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act 2021.

==By religion==

===Christianity===
====Biblical texts====
Christian theology condemns blasphemy. &quot;Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain&quot;, one of the Ten Commandments, forbids blasphemy, which Christians regard as &quot;an affront to God&#x27;s holiness&quot;. 

Leviticus 24:16 states that &quot;anyone who blasphemes the name of Yahweh will be put to death&quot;. 

In Mark , blaspheming the Holy Spirit is spoken of as unforgivable—an eternal sin.

====Church history====

In the early history of the Church, blasphemy &quot;was considered to show active disrespect to God and to involve the use of profane cursing or mockery of his powers&quot;.

In &quot;The Whole Duty of Man&quot;, sometimes attributed to Richard Allestree or John Fell, blasphemy is described as &quot;speaking any evil Thing of God&quot;, and as &quot;the highest Degree whereof is cursing him; or if we do not speak it with our Mouths, yet if we do it in our Hearts, by thinking any unworthy Thing of him, it is look&#x27;d on by God, who sees the Heart, as the vilest Dishonour.&quot;

* Thomas Aquinas says that &quot;[if] we compare murder and blasphemy as regards the objects of those sins, it is clear that blasphemy, which is a sin committed directly against God, is more grave than murder, which is a sin against one&#x27;s neighbor. On the other hand, if we compare them in respect of the harm wrought by them, murder is the graver sin, for murder does more harm to one&#x27;s neighbor, than blasphemy does to God&quot;.
* The &quot;Book of Concord&quot; calls blasphemy &quot;the greatest sin that can be outwardly committed&quot;.
* The &quot;Baptist Confession of Faith&quot; says: &quot;Therefore, to swear vainly or rashly by the glorious and awesome name of God…is sinful, and to be regarded with disgust and detestation. …For by rash, false, and vain oaths, the Lord is provoked and because of them this land mourns&quot;.
* &quot;The Heidelberg Catechism&quot; answers question 100 about blasphemy by stating that &quot;no sin is greater or provokes God&#x27;s wrath more than the blaspheming of His Name&quot;.
* The &quot;Westminster Larger Catechism&quot; explains that &quot;The sins forbidden in the third commandment are, the abuse of it in an ignorant, vain, irreverent, profane...mentioning...by blasphemy...to profane jests, ...vain janglings, ...to charms or sinful lusts and practices&quot;.
* Calvin found it intolerable &quot;when a person is accused of blasphemy, to lay the blame on the of passion, as if God were to endure the penalty whenever we are provoked&quot;.

====Catholic prayers and reparations for blasphemy====

In the Catholic Church, there are specific prayers and devotions as Acts of Reparation for blasphemy. For instance, The Golden Arrow Holy Face Devotion (Prayer) first introduced by Sister Marie of St Peter in 1844 is recited &quot;in a spirit of reparation for blasphemy&quot;. This devotion (started by Sister Marie and then promoted by the Venerable Leo Dupont) was approved by Pope Leo XIII in 1885. The Raccoltabook includes a number of such prayers. The Five First Saturdays devotions are done with the intention in the heart of making reparation to the Blessed Mother for blasphemies against her, her name and her holy initiatives.

The Holy See has specific &quot;Pontifical organizations&quot; for the purpose of the reparation of blasphemy through Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ, e.g. the &quot;Pontifical Congregation of the Benedictine Sisters of the Reparation of the Holy Face.&quot;

====Disputation of Paris====

During the Middle Ages a series of debates on Judaism were staged by the Catholic Church, including the Disputation of Paris (1240), the Disputation of Barcelona (1263), and Disputation of Tortosa (1413–14), and during those disputations, Jewish converts to Christianity, such as Nicholas Donin (in Paris) and Pablo Christiani (in Barcelona) claimed the Talmud contained insulting references to Jesus.

The Disputation of Paris, also known as the Trial of the Talmud, took place in 1240 at the court of the reigning king of France, Louis IX (St. Louis). It followed the work of Nicholas Donin, a Jewish convert to Christianity, who translated the Talmud and pressed 35 charges against it to Pope Gregory IX by quoting a series of alleged blasphemous passages about Jesus, Mary or Christianity. Four rabbis defended the Talmud against Donin&#x27;s accusations. A commission of Christian theologians condemned the Talmud to be burned and on 17 June 1244, twenty-four carriage loads of Jewish religious manuscripts were set on fire in the streets of Paris. The translation of the Talmud from Hebrew to non-Jewish languages stripped Jewish discourse from its covering, something that was resented by Jews as a profound violation.

Between 1239 and 1775, the Roman Catholic Church at various times either forced the censoring of parts of the Talmud that it considered theologically problematic or the destruction of copies of the Talmud. During the inquisition, sects deemed heretical such as the Waldensians were also charged with blasphemy.

===Islam===


====Punishment and definition====
Blasphemy in Islam is impious utterance or action concerning God, Muhammad or anything considered sacred in Islam. The Quran admonishes blasphemy, but does not specify any worldly punishment for blasphemy. The hadiths, which are another source of Sharia, suggest various punishments for blasphemy, which may include death. However, it has been argued that the death penalty applies only to cases where there is treason involved that may seriously harm the Muslim community, especially during times of war. Different traditional schools of jurisprudence prescribe different punishment for blasphemy, depending on whether the blasphemer is Muslim or non-Muslim, a man or a woman. In the modern Muslim world, the laws pertaining to blasphemy vary by country, and some countries prescribe punishments consisting of fines, imprisonment, flogging, hanging, or beheading. Blasphemy laws were rarely enforced in pre-modern Islamic societies, but in the modern era some states and radical groups have used charges of blasphemy in an effort to burnish their religious credentials and gain popular support at the expense of liberal Muslim intellectuals and religious minorities. In recent years, accusations of blasphemy against Islam have sparked international controversies and played part in incidents of mob violence and assassinations of prominent figures.

====Failed OIC anti-blasphemy campaign at UN====

The campaign for worldwide criminal penalties for the &quot;defamation of religions&quot; had been spearheaded by Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on behalf of the United Nations&#x27; large Muslim bloc. The campaign ended in 2011 when the proposal was withdrawn in Geneva, in the Human Rights Council because of lack of support, marking an end to the effort to establish worldwide blasphemy strictures along the lines of those in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. This resolution had passed every year since 1999, in the United Nations, with declining number of &quot;yes&quot; votes with each successive year. In the early 21st century, blasphemy became an issue in the United Nations (UN). The United Nations passed several resolutions which called upon the world to take action against the &quot;defamation of religions&quot;. However, in July 2011, the UN Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) released a 52-paragraph statement which affirmed the freedom of speech and rejected the laws banning &quot;display of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system&#x27;.

====Depictions of Muhammad====
When the Danish newspaper &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; decided to publish cartoons of Muhammad, its editor-in-chief wrote an editorial that the newspaper was publishing the cartoons because Muslims had to get over their &quot;sickly oversensitivity&quot;. Another editor looked upon it as a cultural initiation: &quot;By making fun of people we&#x27;re also including them in our society. It&#x27;s not always easy for those concerned, but that the price they&#x27;re got to pay&quot;. Editors expressed concern that Danish comedians, artists and so on were self-censoring because they were afraid of a violent response from Muslims. 

The global protests that erupted in February 2006 shocked the artists who submitted cartoons. After receiving a bomb threat one cartoonist was angry that Muslims fleeing persecution in their own countries would &quot;want the laws they have fled&quot; to be enforced in Denmark. The editors stood their ground: &quot;Everyone had to accept being subject to satire.&quot;

Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for a car bombing at the Danish embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan in June 2008 which they said was revenge for the &quot;insulting drawings&quot;.

After the Charlie Hebdo attack in 2015 &quot;Je Suis Charlie&quot; became a rallying cry for secular, free speech advocates. The attacks took place in France where the culture of militant secularism celebrates blasphemy but permits viewpoint based restrictions and prior restraint of speech. Emmanuel Todd was very skeptical and critical of the &quot;right to blasphemy&quot; narrative. Skeptics thought it amounted to little more than ridicule of a marginalized group. Scholars rebutting Todd&#x27;s study have found that many of the protestors were liberal, tolerant people who did not have Islamophobic or xenophobic views. For many of the &quot;Je Suis Charlie&quot; protestors the sentiment of the protest was simply: it is not ok to kill someone because they have offended you.

===Judaism===

In the punishment for blasphemy is death. In Jewish law the only form of blasphemy which is punishable by death is blaspheming the name of the Lord. Leviticus 24:16 states that &quot;anyone who blasphemes the name of Yahweh will be put to death&quot;.

The Seven Laws of Noah, which Judaism sees as applicable to all people, prohibit blasphemy.

In one of the texts of the Dead Sea Scrolls, called the Damascus Document, violence against non-Jews (also called Gentiles) is prohibited, except in cases where it is sanctioned by a Jewish governing authority &quot;so that they will not blaspheme&quot;.

=== Hinduism ===

Section 295A of the &quot;Indian Penal Code&quot; lays down the punishment for the deliberate and malicious acts, that are intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. It is one of the Hate speech laws in India. This law prohibits blasphemy against all religions in India. This law originated due to Hindu-Muslim conflict

=== Buddhism ===

Buddhism has no concept of blasphemy. In contrast, in West Asia, the birthplace of Abrahamic religions (namely Islam, Judaism, and Christianity), there was no room for such tolerance and respect for dissent where heretics and blasphemers had to pay with their lives.

Insulting Buddhism is a punishable offence in some Buddhist majority counties like Sri Lanka and Myanmar. In 2015 a man from New Zealand was sentenced to prison for depicting a picture of Buddha with headphones. Similarly, in 2020 Shakthika Sathkumara, a Sri Lankan author was sentenced 10 years in prison for insulting Buddhism.

=== Sikhism ===

Blasphemy is taken harshly by Sikhs. It is called “&quot;beadbi&quot;” by Sikhs. In October, 2021, a Nihang Singh killed a man for &quot;beadbi&quot; of the Sarbloh Granth. In December, 2021, a man was beaten to death at the Golden Temple for committing blasphemy. Such punishments are justified with orthodox Sikhs saying, “instant justice” is deserving for &quot;beadbi&quot; which is the “ultimate act of crime”.

== Backlash against anti-blasphemy laws ==
=== Affirmation of Freedom of Speech (FOS) ===
Multilateral global institutes, such as the Council of Europe and UN, have rejected the imposition of &quot;anti-blasphemy laws&quot; (ABL) and have affirmed the freedom of speech.

==== The Council of Europe&#x27;s rejection of ABL and affirmation of FOS ====
The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, after deliberating on the issue of blasphemy law passed the resolution that blasphemy should not be a criminal offence, which was adopted on 29 June 2007 in the &quot;Recommendation 1805 (2007) on blasphemy, religious insults and hate speech against persons on grounds of their religion&quot;. This Recommendation set a number of guidelines for member states of the Council of Europe in view of Articles 10 (freedom of expression) and 9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion) of the European Convention on Human Rights.

==== UN&#x27;s rejection of ABL and affirmation of FOS ====

After OIC&#x27;s (&quot;Organisation of Islamic Cooperation&quot;) campaign at UN (United Nations) seeking impose of punishment for &quot;defamation of religions&quot; was withdrawn due to consistently dwindling support for their campaign, the UN Human Rights Committee (UNHRC), in July 2011, released a 52-paragraph statement which affirmed the freedom of speech and rejected the laws banning &quot;display of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system&#x27;. UNHRC&#x27;s &quot;General Comment 34 - Paragraph 48&quot; on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 1976, concerning freedoms of opinion and expression states:
=== International Blasphemy Day ===
International Blasphemy Day, observed annually on September 30, encourages individuals and groups to openly express criticism of religion and blasphemy laws. It was founded in 2009 by the Center for Inquiry. A student contacted the Center for Inquiry in Amherst, New York to present the idea, which CFI then supported. Ronald Lindsay, president and CEO of the Center for Inquiry, said, regarding Blasphemy Day, &quot;[W]e think religious beliefs should be subject to examination and criticism just as political beliefs are, but we have a taboo on religion&quot;, in an interview with CNN.

Events worldwide on the first annual Blasphemy Day in 2009 included an art exhibit in Washington, D.C., and a free speech festival in Los Angeles.

=== Removal of blasphemy laws by several nations ===
Other countries have removed bans on blasphemy. France did so in 1881 (this did not extend to Alsace-Moselle region, then part of Germany, after it joined France) to allow freedom of religion and freedom of the press. Blasphemy was abolished or repealed in Sweden in 1970, England and Wales in 2008, Norway with Acts in 2009 and 2015, the Netherlands in 2014, Iceland in 2015, France for its Alsace-Moselle region in 2016, Malta in 2016, Denmark in 2017, Canada in 2018, New Zealand in 2019, and Ireland in 2020.

==Nations with blasphemy laws==

In some countries with a state religion, blasphemy is outlawed under the criminal code.

===Purpose of blasphemy laws===

In some states, blasphemy laws are used to impose the religious beliefs of a majority, while in other countries, they are justified as putatively offering protection of the religious beliefs of minorities. Where blasphemy is banned, it can be either some laws which directly punish religious blasphemy, or some laws that allow those who are offended by blasphemy to punish blasphemers. Those laws may condone penalties or retaliation for blasphemy under the labels of blasphemous libel, expression of opposition, or &quot;vilification,&quot; of religion or of some religious practices, religious insult, or hate speech.

=== Nations with blasphemy laws ===

As of 2012, 33 countries had some form of anti-blasphemy laws in their legal code. Of these, 21 were Muslim-majority nations – Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, the Maldives, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Turkey, the UAE and Western Sahara. Blasphemy is treated as a capital crime (death penalty) in some Muslim nations. In these nations, such laws have led to the persecution, lynchings, murder or arrest of minorities and dissident members, after flimsy accusations.

The other twelve nations with anti-blasphemy laws in 2012 included India and Singapore, as well as Christian majority states, including Denmark (abolished in 2017), Finland, Germany, Greece (abolished in 2019), Ireland (abolished in 2020), Italy, Malta (abolished in 2016), the Netherlands (abolished in 2014), Nigeria, Norway (abolished in 2015) and Poland. Spain&#x27;s &quot;offending religious feelings&quot; law is also, effectively, a prohibition on blasphemy. In Denmark, the former blasphemy law which had support of 66% of its citizens in 2012, made it an offence to &quot;mock legal religions and faiths in Denmark&quot;. Many Danes saw the &quot;blasphemy law as helping integration because it promotes the acceptance of a multicultural and multi-faith society.&quot;

In the judgment &quot;E.S. v. Austria&quot; (2018), the European Court of Human Rights declined to strike down the blasphemy law in Austria on Article 10 (freedom of speech) grounds, saying that criminalisation of blasphemy could be supported within a state&#x27;s margin of appreciation. This decision was widely criticised by human rights organisations and commentators both in Europe and North America.

==Hyperbolic use of the term &quot;blasphemy&quot;==
In contemporary language, the notion of blasphemy is often used hyperbolically (in a deliberately exaggerated manner). This usage has garnered some interest among linguists recently, and the word &quot;blasphemy&quot; is a common case used for illustrative purposes.

<text>Blasphemous is a Metroidvania video game developed by Spanish studio The Game Kitchen and published by Team17. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on 10 September 2019, with Warp Digital handling the console ports. Versions for macOS and Linux were released on 21 September 2020. A version for Amazon Luna was released on 20 October 2020. It began as a Kickstarter campaign in 2017. A sequel, titled &quot;Blasphemous 2&quot;, was released on 24 August 2023.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Blasphemous&quot; is a Metroidvania action-adventure game taking place in the fictional region of Cvstodia. Players assume control of the Penitent One, a silent knight wielding a sword named Mea Culpa, as he travels the land in a pilgrimage.

The game involves exploring Cvstodia while fighting enemies, which appear in most areas. The Penitent One can fight enemies by attacking them with his sword at close range, or by casting spells that can be learned. By damaging enemies with melee attacks, the player gains Fervor, which is consumed to cast spells. Each enemy has a certain attack pattern which players must learn in order to dodge them and avoid taking damage. Some enemy attacks can be parried by blocking at the right time, leaving foes vulnerable and allowing the Penitent One to counterattack them for increased damage. When getting hit, the protagonist&#x27;s health decreases, but it can be recovered by consuming Bile Flasks. Defeating enemies rewards Tears of Atonement, the game&#x27;s currency, that can be spent on shops to upgrade the player character and obtain items.

Numerous upgrades can be acquired at various points of the adventure, which include increasing the Penitent One&#x27;s maximum health, Fervor and amount of Bile Flasks carried, and unlocking new abilities for world exploration and combat. By exploring, interacting with NPCs and completing sidequests, multiple items can be found which, when equipped, provide stat bonuses, reduce or nullify certain types of damage or provide access to otherwise inaccessible areas. There are collectibles in the form of bones that can be delivered in a certain place to receive rewards, and Children of Moonlight – trapped angels that can be freed by attacking the cages they are in.

There are multiple checkpoints in the forms of altars located in multiple areas of the map. The player can rest in these checkpoints to fully replenish their health and refill any used Bile Flasks, save their progress and equip certain abilities, but doing so will also cause all previously slain enemies (excluding bosses) to respawn.

The Penitent One will die if his health is fully depleted, or if he falls into spikes or into a bottomless pit. Upon death, he will respawn in the last checkpoint visited, and a Guilt Fragment will appear in the location of his death (or near it, if he was killed by spikes or falling). The player will have reduced maximum Fervor, and gain less Fervor and Tears of Atonement from enemies, until the Guilt Fragment is recovered by reaching its location and interacting with it. Alternatively, there are certain points where this penalty can be eliminated for a fee. Additionally, after every boss all guilt is alleviated as well.

== Plot ==
=== Setting and characters ===
The game is set in Cvstodia, a land of religion, highly influenced by Roman Catholicism, its iconography, Holy Week in Spain and Spanish culture, particularly that of Andalucía. The land is hallowed by a force known as &quot;The Miracle&quot; (also referred to as &quot;Sorrowful Miracle&quot; or &quot;Grievous Miracle&quot;). This force manifests itself by sometimes blessing and sometimes cursing Cvstodia&#x27;s inhabitants, transforming them into twisted creatures, subject to eternal torment.

The protagonist is The Penitent One, the sole survivor of the Brotherhood of the Silent Sorrow (called so because their members have agreed to a vow of silence). He wears a mask and helmet that consists of barbed wire and a pointed helmet similar to a capirote. His sword originated when a woman, praying for punishment to ease her guilt, repeatedly hit her chest with an effigy of The Twisted One, who is in turn considered the First Miracle. The sword is adorned with spikes as of that of a rose and an effigy. At the beginning of the game, a thorn is given to the Penitent One to attach to the sword&#x27;s handle, which allows it to feed on its wielder&#x27;s sins.

During his pilgrimage, the Penitent One meets characters such as Deogracias, who is found in several key moments of the story and acts as a narrator for the game; Redento, a pilgrim who walks with his back bent and his hands tied as a form of penance; Candelaria, an old merchant who sells various items; and Viridiana, who offers assistance to the player in boss battles. There is a governing Church led by His Holiness Escribar, who was reborn as the Last Son of the Miracle long before the game&#x27;s events.

=== Story ===

&quot;Blasphemous&quot; begins in the Brotherhood of the Silent Sorrow, a religious order opposed to His Holiness Escribar&#x27;s authority, after all its members have been massacred. The last of their kind, the Penitent One, is resurrected by the Miracle and departs on a pilgrimage. After defeating the Warden of the Silent Sorrow, he finds Deogracias, who tells him about the Cradle of Affliction, a sacred relic that the Penitent One seeks, and the Three Humiliations he must perform to be deemed worthy to reach it. He also gives the Penitent One a thorn to add to his sword&#x27;s handle, wounding and feeding off the user&#x27;s guilt.

The Penitent One travels to different locations in Cvstodia, including the decaying town of Albero, the snowing hills Where Olive Trees Wither, and the underground Desecrated Cistern. He completes the Three Humiliations, each of them involving a trial against a different boss, to obtain the Holy Wounds of Attrition, Contrition and Compunction from the three Holy Guardian Visages. After defeating Esdras of the Anointed Legion on the Bridge of the Three Calvaries, the Penitent One gains access to the Mother of Mothers, the massive cathedral where Escribar and the Cradle of Affliction reside.

Throughout the journey, Escribar&#x27;s voice is heard, telling his backstory: A long time before the Penitent One began his pilgrimage, His Holiness Escribar had turned his throne away from his congregation, believing that the Miracle had forsaken them. Gradually, the Miracle transformed Escribar into a massive tree which suddenly ignited one day, leaving behind a massive pile of ash, atop which stood Escribar&#x27;s throne. The Miracle drove countless people to attempt climbing the mountain, but all of them failed, swallowed by the ash. As punishment, they re-emerged from the ash as mindless beasts (the game&#x27;s enemies) cursed to carry out the Miracle&#x27;s will. This included Escribar, who was reborn as the Last Son of the Miracle.

At the top of the Mother of Mothers, the Penitent One encounters Crisanta of the Wrapped Agony, the leader of Escribar&#x27;s soldiers, also revealed in the prequel comic to be responsible for the Penitent One&#x27;s first death and throwing his corpse to where the game began. The Penitent One defeats her, but she escapes. He proceeds to defeat Escribar and the Last Son of the Miracle and encounters the mountain of ash, where Deogracias encourages him to climb it and reach the Cradle of Affliction, leading to one of two endings:

*In the default ending, the Penitent One fails to reach the top and sinks into the ash, leaving nothing but his helmet, which Deogracias picks up and deposits next to a pile of countless identical masks, declaring the Penitent One&#x27;s penance to be over.
*If Deogracias&#x27; thorn has reached its final form after completing optional dungeons, the Penitent One successfully reaches the throne, sits there, and stabs himself with the Mea Culpa. His lifeless body turns into a tree and becomes worshiped by the people of Cvstodia as the new Father and Last Son of the Miracle. In a post-credits cutscene, Crisanta reappears and draws the Mea Culpa from the Penitent One&#x27;s body.

===Wounds of Eventide DLC===
The &quot;Wounds of Eventide&quot; DLC adds a new ending if certain conditions are met. Upon starting a new game over a completed save file, the Penitent One can access the tomb of Perpetva, a winged female warrior who is encountered as a miniboss in the original game and assists her brother Esdras in his bossfight. She reveals that the Perpetva the Penitent One had fought was nothing more than a replica created by the Miracle, and his utter devotion to his mission had convinced her to aid him in unraveling the truth. Giving him a scapular to show Esdras, it convinces him to help the Penitent One as well, granting him access to the prison of the Exiled Visage, the fourth Holy Guardian Visage. For learning the truth behind the Miracle, it was branded a traitor and imprisoned by its three brothers, its eyes removed so that it would be blind to the truth. By helping the Exiled Visage regain its eyes, the Penitent One is given the ultimate Sword Heart of the Mea Culpa that enables it to wound a soul, and knowledge that Crisanta was being enslaved by the High Wills, the true masterminds behind the Miracle. Using the true Mea Culpa to free Crisanta from the High Wills&#x27; control, she grants the Penitent One the Holy Wound of Abnegation, which in combination with the other three Holy Wounds allows him to enter the other side of the Dream, the realm where the High Wills reside. With Crisanta&#x27;s aid, the Penitent One battles and defeats the Last Son of the Miracle yet again, killing Escribar for good.

With nothing standing before them, the Penitent One and Crisanta confront the High Wills, a trio of human faces with a single mind that constantly weep tears of gold. Having possibly manifested as a result of the Cvstodians&#x27; faith, they had created the Miracle in response to the pleas of a youth who would eventually become the Twisted One, a messianic figure in Cvstodian faith. The High Wills selfishly exploit the Cvstodians&#x27; guilt and desire for penance, using the Miracle as a means to gather the Cvstodians&#x27; faith for their own immortality and splendor. Their threats ultimately fall short on the Penitent One and Crisanta, who cut them down in order to end the Miracle and thus Cvstodia&#x27;s suffering, freeing those trapped by the Miracle&#x27;s power such as the Twisted One himself. Kept alive only by the Miracle&#x27;s whim, the Penitent One finally passes away as the Mea Culpa crumbles into dust, with Deogracias and Crisanta laying his body to rest. In the post-credits cutscene, a massive womb descends from the clouds above into Cvstodia, bearing an unknown humanoid figure within.

===Stir of Dawn DLC===
In the &quot;Stir of Dawn&quot; DLC, the Penitent One can optionally meet Jibrael on a New Game+ playthrough, a giant, hunchbacked man with a bugle contorted around his arms. Finding Jibrael in different locations will allow him to play his bugle, releasing the crystal sarcophagi of the Amanecidas, four women created by the Miracle from the immense passion of Laudes, a devotee of the Twisted One. For revering the Twisted One more than the Miracle, the High Wills punished Laudes by sealing her and the Amanecidas away as undead warriors to be awakened only with the Saeta played through Jibrael&#x27;s bugle. After defeating the Amanecidas, Jibrael can awaken Laudes, who battles the Penitent One with the combined abilities of the Amanecidas. After defeating Laudes, she dies peacefully and Jibrael, implied to have loved Laudes in life, is similarly able to find peace and pass on.

===Strife and Ruin DLC===
In the &quot;Strife and Ruin&quot; DLC, a crossover event with &quot;&quot;, the Penitent One encounters Miriam, the game&#x27;s protagonist, trapped in Cvstodia on the Miracle&#x27;s whim. Unable to return to her realm, the Penitent One has the option to aid her by finding crystal shards scattered throughout Cvstodia in order to repair the portal that will send her back. Reclaiming each shard requires the completion of challenging obstacle courses, each subsequent one more difficult than the last. After collecting the shards, Miriam is able to return home, but not before granting the Penitent One a powerful prayer that will summon her to attack alongside him.

== Development ==
Creative director Enrique Cabeza has cited the religious art and iconography of Seville, Spain, as a major influence on &quot;Blasphemous&quot;&#x27; story and design. Cabeza has pointed to Spanish painters such as Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, Francisco Goya, Jusepe de Ribera, Diego Velázquez and Francisco de Zurbarán, particularly noting significant inspiration from Goya&#x27;s &quot;A Procession of Flagellants&quot; as it shares its iconography with the current Holy Week in Spain, the main inspiration for the game.

=== &quot;The Stir of Dawn&quot; and Spanish dub ===
On August 4, 2020, a free expansion for &quot;Blasphemous&quot; titled &quot;The Stir of Dawn&quot; was released for all platforms. The update added New Game+ content and a full Spanish dub.

According to developer Enrique Colinet, the creators of &quot;Blasphemous&quot; had always wanted to have the game&#x27;s voices recorded in Spanish, but limited budget allowed for dubbing in only one language. The team opted for English voice acting, aiming towards a wider market. Following the game&#x27;s commercial success, the developers produced a Spanish dub which featured several renowned Spanish voice actors.

On February 18, 2021, another free expansion for &quot;Blasphemous&quot; called &quot;Strife and Ruin&quot; was released for all platforms. The update added a Boss Rush mode, render mode selection, and challenge rooms.

The update also features a crossover with another indie Metroidvania, &quot;&quot;, where the main character Miriam needs the help of the Penitent One to complete the Challenge Rooms in order for her to return to her world. The developers also added a new Demake Area that features an 8-bit style to the game that makes it feel more like a classic platformer from the NES era of games.

=== &quot;Wounds of Eventide&quot; ===
On August 27, 2021, a third expansion, titled &quot;Wounds of Eventide&quot; was announced.

&quot;Wounds of Eventide&quot; was released on December 9, 2021 as free DLC. The update mainly added bosses and a quest, that leads to the true ending of the game.

== Reception ==
&quot;Blasphemous&quot; received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic. it received praise for its visual style, combat, boss battles and interconnected world while criticism was reserved towards its level design, difficulty and pacing.

In 2021, &quot;GQ España&quot; named &quot;Blasphemous&quot; one of the best Spanish-made games ever.

The game won the awards for &quot;Best Spanish Development&quot; and &quot;Indie Game of the Year&quot; at the 2019 Titanium Awards, where it was also nominated for &quot;Best Art&quot;.
