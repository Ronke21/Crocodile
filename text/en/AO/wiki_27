<text>In Norse mythology, Iðunn is a goddess associated with apples and youth. Iðunn is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, she is described as the wife of the skaldic god Bragi, and in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, also as a keeper of apples and granter of eternal youthfulness.

The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; relates how Loki was once forced by the jötunn Þjazi to lure Iðunn out of Asgard and into a wood with the promise of apples even fairer than her own. Þjazi, in the form of an eagle, abducts Iðunn from the wood, bearing her off to his home. Iðunn&#x27;s absence causes the gods to grow old and grey, and they realize that Loki is responsible for her disappearance. Under duress, Loki promises to bring her back and, setting out in the form of a falcon, eventually finds her alone at Þjazi&#x27;s home. He turns her into a nut and flies back toward Asgard. When Þjazi returns to find Iðunn gone, he assumes his eagle form once more and flies off in hot pursuit of Loki and his precious burden. The gods build a pyre in the courtyard of Asgard and, just as Loki has stopped short of it, kindle it. Unable to halt his frenzied onrush, Þjazi plunges headlong through the fire, falling to the ground with his feathers aflame, whereupon the gods attack and kill him.

A number of theories surround Iðunn, including potential links to fertility, and her potential origin in Proto-Indo-European religion. Long the subject of artworks, Iðunn is sometimes referenced in modern popular culture.

==Name==
The name &quot;Iðunn&quot; has been variously explained as meaning &#x27;ever young&#x27;, &#x27;rejuvenator&#x27;, or &#x27;the rejuvenating one&#x27;. As the modern English alphabet lacks the eth (ð) character, &quot;Iðunn&quot; is sometimes anglicized as Idhunn, Idunn, Idun, or Ithun. An -a suffix is sometimes appended to denote femininity, resulting in forms such as Iduna and Idunna.

The name &quot;Iðunn&quot; appears as a personal name in several historical sources and the records that it has been in use in Iceland as a personal name since the pagan period (10th century). records two incidents of women by the name of &quot;Iðunn&quot;; Iðunn Arnardóttir, the daughter of an early settler, and Iðunn Molda-Gnúpsdóttir, granddaughter of one of the earliest settlers recorded in the book. The name &quot;Iðunn&quot; has been theorized as the origin of the Old English name &quot;Idonea&quot;. The 19th century author C.M. Yonge writes that the derivation of &quot;Idonea&quot; from &quot;Idunn&quot; is &quot;almost certain,&quot; noting that although &quot;Idonea&quot; may be &quot;the feminine of the Latin (fit), its absence in the Romance countries may be taken as an indication that it was a mere classicising of the northern goddess of the apples of youth.&quot;

The 19th century scholar Jacob Grimm proposed a potential etymological connection to the idisi. Grimm states that &quot;with the original form &quot;idis&quot; the goddess Idunn may possibly be connected.&quot; Grimm further states that Iðunn may have been known with another name, and that &quot;Iðunn would seem by Saem. 89a to be an Elvish word, but we do not hear of any other name for the goddess.&quot;

==Attestations==
===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===

Iðunn appears in the Poetic Edda poem &quot;Lokasenna&quot; and, included in some modern editions of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, in the late poem &quot;Hrafnagaldr Óðins&quot;.

Iðunn is introduced as Bragi&#x27;s wife in the prose introduction to the poem &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, where the two attend a feast held by Ægir. In stanzas 16, 17, and 18, dialog occurs between Loki and Iðunn after Loki has insulted Bragi. In stanza 16, Iðunn (here anglicized as &quot;Idunn&quot;) says:

In this exchange, Loki has accused Iðunn of having slept with the killer of her brother. However, neither this brother nor killer are accounted for in any other surviving source. Afterward, the goddess Gefjon speaks up and the poem continues in turn.

In the poem &quot;Hrafnagaldr Óðins&quot;, additional information is given about Iðunn, though this information is otherwise unattested. Here, Iðunn is identified as descending from elves, as one of &quot;Ivaldi&#x27;s elder children&quot; and as a dís who dwells in dales. Stanza 6 reads:

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
Iðunn is introduced in the Prose Edda in section 26 of the Prose Edda book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;. Here, Iðunn is described as Bragi&#x27;s wife and keeper of an (a wooden box made of ash wood and often used for carrying personal possessions) within which she keeps apples. The apples are bitten into by the gods when they begin to grow old and they then become young again, which is described as occurring up until Ragnarök. Gangleri (described as King Gylfi in disguise) states that it seems to him that the gods depend greatly upon Iðunn&#x27;s good faith and care. With a laugh, High responds that misfortune once came close, that he could tell Gangleri about it, but first he must hear the names of more of the Æsir, and he continues providing information about gods.

In the book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Idunn is mentioned in its first chapter (numbered as 55) as one of eight ásynjur (goddesses) sitting in their thrones at a banquet in Asgard for Ægir. In chapter 56, Bragi tells Ægir about Iðunn&#x27;s abduction by the jötunn Þjazi. Bragi says that after hitting an eagle (Þjazi in disguise) with a pole, Loki finds himself stuck to the bird. Loki is pulled further and further into the sky, his feet banging against stones, gravel, and trees until, fearful that his arms will be pulled from their sockets, he roars for mercy, begging the eagle to set him free. The eagle agrees, but only on the condition that Loki make a solemn vow to lure Iðunn, bearing her apples of youth, from the safety of Asgard. Loki accepts Þjazi&#x27;s conditions and returns to his friends Odin and Hœnir. At the time agreed upon by Loki and Þjazi, Loki lures Iðunn out of Asgard into &quot;a certain forest&quot;, telling her that he has discovered some apples that she would find worth keeping, and furthermore that she should bring her own apples with her so that she may compare them with the apples he has discovered. Þjazi arrives in eagle shape, snatches Iðunn, flies away with her and takes her to his home, Þrymheimr.

The Æsir begin to grow grey and old at the disappearance of Idunn. The Æsir assemble at a thing where they ask one another when Iðunn had been seen last. The Æsir realize that the last time that Iðunn was seen was when she was going outside of Asgard with Loki, and so they have Loki arrested and brought to the thing. Loki is threatened with death and torture. Terrified, Loki says that if the goddess Freyja will lend him her &quot;falcon shape&quot; he will search for Iðunn in the land of Jötunheimr. Freyja lends the falcon shape to Loki, and with it he flies north to Jötunheimr. One day later, Loki arrives at Þjazi&#x27;s home. There he discovers that Þjazi is out at sea in a boat, having left Iðunn at home alone. Loki transforms the goddess into a nut, grasps her in his claws, and flies away with her as fast as possible.

Þjazi, arriving home to discover Iðunn gone, resumes his eagle shape and flies off in pursuit of Loki, his mighty wings stirring up a storm as he does so. The Æsir, seeing a falcon flying with a nut clutched in its claws and hotly pursued by an eagle, make haste to pile up a great heap of wood shavings and set it alight. The falcon flies over the battlements of Asgard and drops down behind the wall. The eagle, however, overshoots the falcon, and unable to stop, plunges through the fire, setting light to his feathers, and falling to the ground within the gates of Asgard, whereat the Æsir set upon the jötunn and kill him, leading the narrator to comment &quot;and this killing is greatly renowned.&quot;

In chapter 10, &quot;husband of Iðunn&quot; is given as a means of referring to Bragi. In chapter 86, means of referring to Iðunn are given: &quot;wife of Bragi&quot;, &quot;keeper of the apples&quot;, and her apples &quot;the Æsir&#x27;s age old cure&quot;. Additionally, in connection to the story of her abduction by Þjazi, she may be referred to as &quot;Þjazi&#x27;s booty&quot;. A passage of the 10th-century poem &quot;Haustlöng&quot; where the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir gives a lengthy description of a richly detailed shield he has received that features a depiction of the abduction of Iðunn. Within the cited portions of &quot;Haustlöng&quot;, Iðunn is referred to as &quot;the maid who knew the Æsir&#x27;s old age cure&quot;, &quot;the gods&#x27; lady&quot;, &quot;ale-Gefn&quot;, &quot;the Æsir&#x27;s girl-friend&quot;, and once by name.

In chapter 33, Iðunn is cited as one of the six ásynjur visiting Ægir. Iðunn appears a final time in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; in chapter 75, where she appears in a list of ásynjur.

==Theories==
===Apples and fertility===
Some surviving stories regarding Iðunn focus on her youth-maintaining apples. English scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism. She points out that buckets of apples were found in the 9th-century Oseberg ship burial site in Norway and that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe which may have had a symbolic meaning and also that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in Southwest England.

Davidson notes a connection between apples and the Vanir, a group of gods associated with fertility in Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven &quot;golden apples&quot; being given to woo the beautiful Gerðr by Skírnir, who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god Freyr in stanzas 19 and 20 of &quot;Skírnismál&quot;. In &quot;Skírnismál&quot;, Gerðr mentions her brother&#x27;s slayer in stanza 16, which Davidson states has led to some suggestions that Gerðr may have been connected to Iðunn as they are similar in this way. Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology; in chapter 2 of the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; when the major goddess Frigg sends King Rerir an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg&#x27;s messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a mound. Rerir&#x27;s wife&#x27;s consumption of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the caesarean section birth of their son—the hero Völsung.

Davidson points out the &quot;strange&quot; phrase &quot;apples of Hel&quot; used in an 11th-century poem by the skald Þórbjörn Brúnason. Davidson states this may imply that the apple was thought of by the skald as the food of the dead. Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess Nehalennia is sometimes depicted with apples and parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the Roman Empire and came to Europe from the Near East, the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter. Davidson concludes that in the figure of Iðunn &quot;we must have a dim reflection of an old symbol: that of the guardian goddess of the life-giving fruit of the other world.&quot;

===Indo-European basis===
David Knipe theorizes Iðunn&#x27;s abduction by Thjazi in eagle form as an example of the Indo-European motif &quot;of an eagle who steals the celestial means of immortality.&quot; In addition, Knipe says that &quot;a parallel to the theft of Iðunn&#x27;s apples (symbols of fertility) has been noted in the Celtic myth where Brian, Iuchar, and Icharba, the sons of Tuirenn, assume the guise of hawks in order to steal sacred apples from the garden of Hisberna. Here, too, there is pursuit, the guardians being female griffins.&quot;

===Other===
John Lindow theorizes that the possible etymological meaning of &quot;Iðunn&quot;—&#x27;ever young&#x27;—would potentially allow Iðunn to perform her ability to provide eternal youthfulness to the gods without her apples, and further states that &quot;Haustlöng&quot; does not mention apples but rather refers to Iðunn as the &quot;maiden who understood the eternal life of the Æsir.&quot; Lindow further theorizes that Iðunn&#x27;s abduction is &quot;one of the most dangerous moments&quot; for the gods, as the general movement of female jötnar to the gods would be reversed.

Regarding the accusations levelled towards Iðunn by Loki, Lee Hollander opines that &quot;Lokasenna&quot; was intended to be humorous and that the accusations thrown by Loki in the poem are not necessarily to be taken as &quot;generally accepted lore&quot; at the time it was composed. Rather they are charges that are easy for Loki to make and difficult for his targets to disprove, or which they do not care to refute.

In his study of the skaldic poem &quot;Haustlöng&quot;, Richard North comments that &quot;[Iðunn] is probably to be understood as an aspect of Freyja, a goddess whom the gods rely on for their youth and beauty [...]&quot;.

==Modern influence==
Iðunn has been the subject of a number of artistic depictions. These depictions include &quot;Idun&quot; (statue, 1821) by H. E. Freund, &quot;Idun&quot; (statue, 1843) and (plaster statue, 1856) by C. G. Qvarnström, (1846) by Nils Blommér, by C. Hansen (resulting in an 1862 woodcut modeled on the painting by C. Hammer), (drawing, 1882) by K. Ehrenberg, &quot;Idun and the Apples&quot; (1890) by J. Doyle Penrose, &quot;Brita as Iduna&quot; (1901) by Carl Larsson, (1911) by John Bauer, &quot;Idun&quot; (watercolor, 1905) by B. E. Ward, and &quot;Idun&quot; (1901) by E. Doepler.

The 19th-century composer Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; opera cycle features Freia, a version of the goddess Freyja combined with Iðunn.

Several publications have been named after the goddess. The publication of the United States–based Germanic neopagan group The Troth (&quot;Idunna&quot;, edited by Diana L. Paxson) derives its name from that of the goddess. The Swedish women&#x27;s journal &quot;Idun&quot; depicted Idun with her basket of apples on its banner. Additionally, an American Swedish-language women&#x27;s journal, (&#x27;New Idun&#x27;), was published from 1906 to 1924.

The asteroid 176 Iduna was named after the men&#x27;s association . Idunn Mons, a mons of the planet Venus, is named after Iðunn.

In 2024, the Swedish Maritime Administration renamed a recently-acquired second-hand icebreaker &quot;Idun&quot; to reflect how the ship, decades younger than the other Swedish icebreakers, would &quot;rejuvenate&quot; the aging state-owned fleet.

<text>In Norse mythology, Þjazi (Old Norse: ; anglicized as Thiazi, Thiazzi, Thjazi, Tjasse or Thiassi) was a jötunn. He was a son of the jötunn Ölvaldi, brother of Iði and Gangr, and the father of Skaði. His most notable misdeed was the kidnapping of the goddess Iðunn, which is related in both the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and the skaldic poem &quot;Haustlöng&quot;.

Saturn&#x27;s moon Thiazzi was named after him.

==&quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;==

According to &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, the gods Odin, Loki and Hœnir set out one day on a journey, traveling through mountains and wilderness until they were in need of food. In a valley they saw a herd of oxen, and they took one of the oxen and set it in an earth oven, but after a while they found that it would not cook. As they were trying to determine the reason for this, they heard someone talking in the oak tree above them, saying that he himself was the one responsible for the oven not cooking. They looked up and saw that it was Þjazi in the form of a great eagle, and he told
them that if they would let him eat from the ox, then he would make the oven cook. To this they agreed, so he came down from the tree and began devouring a large portion of the meal. He ate so much of it that Loki became angry, grabbed his long staff and attempted to strike him, but the weapon stuck fast to Þjazi&#x27;s body and he took flight, carrying Loki up with him. As they flew across the land Loki shouted and begged to be let down as his legs banged against trees and stones, but Þjazi would only do so on the condition that Loki must lure Iðunn out of Asgard with her apples of youth, which he solemnly promised to do.

Later, at the agreed time, Loki lured Iðunn out of Asgard into a forest, telling her he had found some apples that she might think worth having, and that she should bring her own apples with her to compare them. Þjazi then appeared in his eagle shape, grabbed Iðunn and flew away with her to his realm of Þrymheimr, located in Jötunheimr.

The gods, deprived of Iðunn&#x27;s apples, began growing old and grey. When they learned that Iðunn was last seen going out of Asgard with Loki, they threatened him with torture and death until he agreed to rescue her. Loki borrowed a magical coat from Freyja that would allow him to take the shape of a falcon, then flew to Jotunheim until he reached the hall of Þjazi. Finding Iðunn alone while Þjazi was out to sea on a boat, Loki transformed her into a nut and carried her back, flying as fast as he could. When Þjazi returned home and discovered she was gone he assumed his eagle form and flew after
Loki. When the gods saw Loki flying toward them with Þjazi right behind they lit a fire which burned Þjazi&#x27;s feathers, causing him to fall to the ground where he was set upon and killed.

Þjazi&#x27;s daughter Skadi then put on her war gear and went to Asgard to seek vengeance, but the gods offered her atonement and compensation until she was placated. She was also given the hand of Njord in marriage, and as a further reparation Odin took Þjazi&#x27;s eyes and placed them in the night sky as stars.

Also according to &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Þjazi and his brothers Gangr and Idi had a father named Olvaldi. Olvaldi was very rich in gold, and when he died his three sons divided their inheritance between them by each in turn taking a mouthful. For this reason the expressions &quot;speech of Þjazi, Gangr or Idi&quot; and &quot;Idi&#x27;s shining talk&quot; are kennings for gold, and twice in the same book a kenning is given for Þjazi as &quot;lady wolf&quot;, a reference to his abduction of Iðunn. Another is &quot;snowshoe deity&#x27;s fosterer&quot;, or the father of the goddess who goes about on skis.

==&quot;Grímnismál&quot;==

In &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, during Odin&#x27;s visions of the various dwelling places of gods and jötunn he mentions that of Þjazi in stanza 11:

:&quot;Thrymheim the sixth is called
:where Þjazi lived, the terrible giant,
:but now Skadi, shining bride of the gods,
:lives in her father&#x27;s ancient courts&quot;

==&quot;Hárbarðsljóð&quot;==
According to &quot;Hárbarðsljóð&quot;, it was not Odin but Thor who claimed to have made Þjazi&#x27;s eyes into stars in stanza 19:

Thor said:

:&quot;I killed Þjazi, the powerful minded giant.
:I threw up the eyes of Olvaldi&#x27;s son
:into the bright heavens.
:They are the greatest sign of my deeds,
:those which all men can see afterwards.
:What were you doing meanwhile, Harbard?&quot;

==&quot;Lokasenna&quot;==

In &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, it was neither Odin nor Thor but Loki himself who during his verbal sparring with Skadi lays claim to the death of her father in stanza 50:

Loki said:

:&quot;You know, if on a sharp rock, with my ice cold son&#x27;s guts
:the gods shall bind me,
:first and foremost I was at the killing
:when we attacked Þjazi&quot;

==&quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;==

According to the interpolated group of stanzas known as the &quot;Short Völuspá&quot; in &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;, Þjazi is further described as &quot;the giant who loved to shoot&quot;.

==Familiar forms==
* Þjazi, anglicized as
:* Thiazi
:* Thjazi
:* Thiassi
* Tjatse (mainland Scandinavian)
* Tjasse (Norse)

Scholars have debated whether Þjazi can be identified with the Vedic god Tvashtr.

<doc id="88440" wikidata="Q478424" url="?curid=88440" title="List of counties in Massachusetts">
<text>The U.S. state of Massachusetts has 14 counties, though eight of these fourteen county governments were abolished between 1997 and 2000. The counties in the southeastern portion of the state retain county-level local government (Barnstable, Bristol, Dukes, Norfolk, Plymouth) or, in one case, (Nantucket County) consolidated city-county government. Vestigial judicial and law enforcement districts still follow county boundaries even in the counties whose county-level government has been disestablished, and the counties are still generally recognized as geographic entities if not political ones. Three counties (Hampshire, Barnstable, and Franklin) have formed new county regional compacts to serve as a form of regional governance.

== Abolitions of some county governments ==
Mismanagement of Middlesex County&#x27;s public hospital in the mid-1990s left that county on the brink of insolvency, and in 1997 the Massachusetts legislature stepped in by assuming all assets and obligations of the county. The government of Middlesex County was officially abolished on July 11, 1997. Later that year, the Franklin County Commission voted itself out of existence. The law abolishing Middlesex County also provided for the elimination of Hampden County and Worcester County on July 1, 1998. This law was later amended to abolish Hampshire County on January 1, 1999; Essex County and Suffolk County on July 1 of that same year; and Berkshire County on July 1, 2000. State law allows other counties either to abolish themselves, or to reorganize as a &quot;regional council of governments&quot;, as Hampshire and Franklin Counties have done. The governments of Bristol, Plymouth, and Norfolk Counties remain substantially unchanged. Barnstable and Dukes Counties have adopted modern county charters, enabling them to act as efficient regional governments. Dukes County in particular has a strong regional planning agency known as the Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Commission.

== District Attorneys ==
Jurisdictional areas for District Attorneys are created by state law and while some follow traditional county boundaries, names and geographic areas covered are often different. Criminal matters in Essex County are handled by the District Attorney for the Eastern District; in Middlesex County by the District Attorney for the Northern District; in Worcester County by the District Attorney for the Middle District; in Dukes, Barnstable and Nantucket counties by the District Attorney for the Cape and Islands District and in Franklin and Hampshire counties by the District Attorney for the Northwestern District. The districts for the counties of Berkshire, Bristol, Hampden, Norfolk, Plymouth and Suffolk are the same in geography and nomenclature as the respective counties, and the District Attorneys for the Eastern, Middle, and Northern Districts are commonly known as the Essex County, Worcester County, and Middlesex County District Attorneys, respectively.

== Historical counties ==
Eleven other historical counties have existed in Massachusetts, most becoming defunct when their lands were absorbed into the colony of New Hampshire or the state of Maine, both of which were created out of territory originally claimed by Massachusetts colonists. The oldest counties still in Massachusetts are Essex County, Middlesex County, and Suffolk County, created in 1643 with the original Norfolk County which was absorbed by New Hampshire and bears no relation to the modern Norfolk County. When these counties were created, they were a part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, which would remain separate from the Plymouth Colony and that colony&#x27;s counties until 1691. Hampden County, created in 1812, is the most recently created county still in Massachusetts, although Penobscot County, Maine bore that distinction until Maine broke off from Massachusetts in 1820. The majority of Massachusetts counties are named in honor of English place names, reflecting Massachusetts&#x27; colonial heritage.

== Shire town ==
The term &quot;shire town&quot; is the statutory term for the Massachusetts town having a county court and administration offices; a county can have multiple shire towns. &quot;County seat&quot; is the standard term used in general communications by the Massachusetts government.

==FIPS code==
The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, used by the United States government to uniquely identify counties, is provided with each entry. FIPS codes are five-digit numbers; for Massachusetts the codes start with 25 and are completed with the three-digit county code. The FIPS code for each county in the table links to census data for that county.

<text>A phosphor is a substance that exhibits the phenomenon of luminescence; it emits light when exposed to some type of radiant energy. The term is used both for fluorescent or phosphorescent substances which glow on exposure to ultraviolet or visible light, and cathodoluminescent substances which glow when struck by an electron beam (cathode rays) in a cathode-ray tube.

When a phosphor is exposed to radiation, the orbital electrons in its molecules are excited to a higher energy level; when they return to their former level they emit the energy as light of a certain color. Phosphors can be classified into two categories: fluorescent substances which emit the energy immediately and stop glowing when the exciting radiation is turned off, and phosphorescent substances which emit the energy after a delay, so they keep glowing after the radiation is turned off, decaying in brightness over a period of milliseconds to days.

Fluorescent materials are used in applications in which the phosphor is excited continuously: cathode-ray tubes (CRT) and plasma video display screens, fluoroscope screens, fluorescent lights, scintillation sensors, white LEDs, and luminous paints for black light art. Phosphorescent materials are used where a persistent light is needed, such as glow-in-the-dark watch faces and aircraft instruments, and in radar screens to allow the target &#x27;blips&#x27; to remain visible as the radar beam rotates. CRT phosphors were standardized beginning around World War II and designated by the letter &quot;P&quot; followed by a number.

Phosphorus, the light-emitting chemical element for which phosphors are named, emits light due to chemiluminescence, not phosphorescence.

==Light-emission process==
The scintillation process in inorganic materials is due to the electronic band structure found in the crystals. An incoming particle can excite an electron from the valence band to either the conduction band or the exciton band (located just below the conduction band and separated from the valence band by an energy gap). This leaves an associated hole behind, in the valence band. Impurities create electronic levels in the forbidden gap.

The excitons are loosely bound electron–hole pairs that wander through the crystal lattice until they are captured as a whole by impurity centers. They then rapidly de-excite by emitting scintillation light (fast component).

In the conduction band, electrons are independent of their associated holes. Those electrons and holes are captured successively by impurity centers exciting certain metastable states not accessible to the excitons. The delayed de-excitation of those metastable impurity states, slowed by reliance on the low-probability forbidden mechanism, again results in light emission (slow component).
In the case of inorganic scintillators, the activator impurities are typically chosen so that the emitted light is in the visible range or near-UV, where photomultipliers are effective.

Phosphors are often transition-metal compounds or rare-earth compounds of various types. In inorganic phosphors, these inhomogeneities in the crystal structure are created usually by addition of a trace amount of dopants, impurities called &quot;activators&quot;. (In rare cases dislocations or other crystal defects can play the role of the impurity.) The wavelength emitted by the emission center is dependent on the atom itself and on the surrounding crystal structure.

==Materials==
Phosphors are usually made from a suitable host material with an added activator. The best known type is a copper-activated zinc sulfide (ZnS) and the silver-activated zinc sulfide (&quot;zinc sulfide silver&quot;).

The host materials are typically oxides, nitrides and oxynitrides, sulfides, selenides, halides or silicates of zinc, cadmium, manganese, aluminium, silicon, or various rare-earth metals. The activators prolong the emission time (afterglow). In turn, other materials (such as nickel) can be used to quench the afterglow and shorten the decay part of the phosphor emission characteristics.

Many phosphor powders are produced in low-temperature processes, such as sol-gel, and usually require post-annealing at temperatures of ~1000 °C, which is undesirable for many applications. However, proper optimization of the growth process allows manufacturers to avoid the annealing.

Phosphors used for fluorescent lamps require a multi-step production process, with details that vary depending on the particular phosphor. Bulk material must be milled to obtain a desired particle size range, since large particles produce a poor-quality lamp coating, and small particles produce less light and degrade more quickly. During the firing of the phosphor, process conditions must be controlled to prevent oxidation of the phosphor activators or contamination from the process vessels. After milling, the phosphor may be washed to remove minor excess of activator elements. Volatile elements must not be allowed to escape during processing. Lamp manufacturers have changed compositions of phosphors to eliminate some toxic elements formerly used, such as beryllium, cadmium, or thallium.

The commonly quoted parameters for phosphors are the wavelength of emission maximum (in nanometers, or alternatively color temperature in kelvins for white blends), the peak width (in nanometers at 50% of intensity), and decay time (in seconds).

Examples:
* Calcium sulfide with strontium sulfide with bismuth as activator, , yields blue light with glow times up to 12 hours, red and orange are modifications of the zinc sulfide formula. Red color can be obtained from strontium sulfide.
* Zinc sulfide with about 5 ppm of a copper activator is the most common phosphor for the glow-in-the-dark toys and items. It is also called GS phosphor.
*Mix of zinc sulfide and cadmium sulfide emit color depending on their ratio; increasing of the CdS content shifts the output color towards longer wavelengths; its persistence ranges between 1–10 hours.
* Strontium aluminate activated by europium or dysprosium, SrAl2O4:Eu(II):Dy(III), is a material developed in 1993 by Nemoto &amp; Co. engineer Yasumitsu Aoki with higher brightness and significantly longer glow persistence; it produces green and aqua hues, where green gives the highest brightness and aqua the longest glow time. SrAl2O4:Eu:Dy is about 10 times brighter, 10 times longer glowing, and 10 times more expensive than ZnS:Cu. The excitation wavelengths for strontium aluminate range from 200 to 450 nm. The wavelength for its green formulation is 520 nm, its blue-green version emits at 505 nm, and the blue one emits at 490 nm. Colors with longer wavelengths can be obtained from the strontium aluminate as well, though for the price of some loss of brightness.

==Phosphor degradation==
Many phosphors tend to lose efficiency gradually by several mechanisms. The activators can undergo change of valence (usually oxidation), the crystal lattice degrades, atoms – often the activators – diffuse through the material, the surface undergoes chemical reactions with the environment with consequent loss of efficiency or buildup of a layer absorbing the exciting and/or radiated energy, etc.

The degradation of electroluminescent devices depends on frequency of driving current, the luminance level, and temperature; moisture impairs phosphor lifetime very noticeably as well.

Harder, high-melting, water-insoluble materials display lower tendency to lose luminescence under operation.

Examples:
* BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ (BAM), a plasma-display phosphor, undergoes oxidation of the dopant during baking. Three mechanisms are involved; absorption of oxygen atoms into oxygen vacancies on the crystal surface, diffusion of Eu(II) along the conductive layer, and electron transfer from Eu(II) to absorbed oxygen atoms, leading to formation of Eu(III) with corresponding loss of emissivity. Thin coating of aluminium phosphate or lanthanum(III) phosphate is effective in creating a barrier layer blocking access of oxygen to the BAM phosphor, for the cost of reduction of phosphor efficiency. Addition of hydrogen, acting as a reducing agent, to argon in the plasma displays significantly extends the lifetime of BAM:Eu2+ phosphor, by reducing the Eu(III) atoms back to Eu(II).
* Y2O3:Eu phosphors under electron bombardment in presence of oxygen form a non-phosphorescent layer on the surface, where electron–hole pairs recombine nonradiatively via surface states.
* ZnS:Mn, used in AC thin-film electroluminescent (ACTFEL) devices degrades mainly due to formation of deep-level traps, by reaction of water molecules with the dopant; the traps act as centers for nonradiative recombination. The traps also damage the crystal lattice. Phosphor aging leads to decreased brightness and elevated threshold voltage.
* ZnS-based phosphors in CRTs and FEDs degrade by surface excitation, coulombic damage, build-up of electric charge, and thermal quenching. Electron-stimulated reactions of the surface are directly correlated to loss of brightness. The electrons dissociate impurities in the environment, the reactive oxygen species then attack the surface and form carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide with traces of carbon, and nonradiative zinc oxide and zinc sulfate on the surface; the reactive hydrogen removes sulfur from the surface as hydrogen sulfide, forming nonradiative layer of metallic zinc. Sulfur can be also removed as sulfur oxides.
* ZnS and CdS phosphors degrade by reduction of the metal ions by captured electrons. The M2+ ions are reduced to M+; two M+ then exchange an electron and become one M2+ and one neutral M atom. The reduced metal can be observed as a visible darkening of the phosphor layer. The darkening (and the brightness loss) is proportional to the phosphor&#x27;s exposure to electrons and can be observed on some CRT screens that displayed the same image (e.g. a terminal login screen) for prolonged periods.
* Europium(II)-doped alkaline earth aluminates degrade by formation of color centers.
* :Ce3+ degrades by loss of luminescent Ce3+ ions.
* :Mn (P1) degrades by desorption of oxygen under electron bombardment.
* Oxide phosphors can degrade rapidly in presence of fluoride ions, remaining from incomplete removal of flux from phosphor synthesis.
* Loosely packed phosphors, e.g. when an excess of silica gel (formed from the potassium silicate binder) is present, have tendency to locally overheat due to poor thermal conductivity. E.g. :Tb3+ is subject to accelerated degradation at higher temperatures.

==Applications==

===Lighting===
Phosphor layers provide most of the light produced by fluorescent lamps, and are also used to improve the balance of light produced by metal halide lamps. Various neon signs use phosphor layers to produce different colors of light. Electroluminescent displays found, for example, in aircraft instrument panels, use a phosphor layer to produce glare-free illumination or as numeric and graphic display devices. White LED lamps consist of a blue or ultra-violet emitter with a phosphor coating that emits at longer wavelengths, giving a full spectrum of visible light. Unfocused and undeflected cathode-ray tubes have been used as stroboscope lamps since 1958.

===Phosphor thermometry===

Phosphor thermometry is a temperature measurement approach that uses the temperature dependence of certain phosphors. For this, a phosphor coating is applied to a surface of interest and, usually, the decay time is the emission parameter that indicates temperature. Because the illumination and detection optics can be situated remotely, the method may be used for moving surfaces such as high speed motor surfaces. Also, phosphor may be applied to the end of an optical fiber as an optical analog of a thermocouple.

===Glow-in-the-dark toys===

In these applications, the phosphor is directly added to the plastic used to mold the toys, or mixed with a binder for use as paints.

ZnS:Cu phosphor is used in glow-in-the-dark cosmetic creams frequently used for Halloween make-ups.
Generally, the persistence of the phosphor increases as the wavelength increases. 
See also lightstick for chemiluminescence-based glowing items.

===Oxygen sensing===
Quenching of the triplet state by O2 (which has a triplet ground state) as a result of Dexter energy transfer is well known in solutions of phosphorescent heavy-metal complexes and doped polymers. In recent years, phosphorescence porous materials(such as Metal–organic frameworks and Covalent organic frameworks) have shown promising oxygen sensing capabilities, for their non-linear gas-adsorption in ultra-low partial pressures of oxygen.

===Postage stamps===
Phosphor banded stamps first appeared in 1959 as guides for machines to sort mail. Around the world many varieties exist with different amounts of banding. Postage stamps are sometimes collected by whether or not they are &quot;tagged&quot; with phosphor (or printed on luminescent paper).

===Radioluminescence===

Zinc sulfide phosphors are used with radioactive materials, where the phosphor was excited by the alpha- and beta-decaying isotopes, to create luminescent paint for dials of watches and instruments (radium dials). Between 1913 and 1950 radium-228 and radium-226 were used to activate a phosphor made of silver doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Ag), which gave a greenish glow. The phosphor is not suitable to be used in layers thicker than 25 mg/cm2, as the self-absorption of the light then becomes a problem. Furthermore, zinc sulfide undergoes degradation of its crystal lattice structure, leading to gradual loss of brightness significantly faster than the depletion of radium. ZnS:Ag coated spinthariscope screens were used by Ernest Rutherford in his experiments discovering atomic nucleus.

Copper doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu) is the most common phosphor used and yields blue-green light. Copper and magnesium doped zinc sulfide yields yellow-orange light.

Tritium is also used as a source of radiation in various products utilizing tritium illumination.

===Electroluminescence===

Electroluminescence can be exploited in light sources. Such sources typically emit from a large area, which makes them suitable for backlights of LCD displays. The excitation of the phosphor is usually achieved by application of high-intensity electric field, usually with suitable frequency. Current electroluminescent light sources tend to degrade with use, resulting in their relatively short operation lifetimes.

ZnS:Cu was the first formulation successfully displaying electroluminescence, tested at 1936 by Georges Destriau in Madame Marie Curie laboratories in Paris.

Powder or AC electroluminescence is found in a variety of backlight and night light applications. Several groups offer branded EL offerings (e.g. IndiGlo used in some Timex watches) or &quot;Lighttape&quot;, another trade name of an electroluminescent material, used in electroluminescent light strips. The Apollo space program is often credited with being the first significant use of EL for backlights and lighting.

===White LEDs===
White light-emitting diodes are usually blue InGaN LEDs with a coating of a suitable material. Cerium(III)-doped YAG (YAG:Ce3+, or Y3Al5O12:Ce3+) is often used; it absorbs the light from the blue LED and emits in a broad range from greenish to reddish, with most of its output in yellow. This yellow emission combined with the remaining blue emission gives the &quot;white&quot; light, which can be adjusted to color temperature as warm (yellowish) or cold (bluish) white. The pale yellow emission of the Ce3+:YAG can be tuned by substituting the cerium with other rare-earth elements such as terbium and gadolinium and can even be further adjusted by substituting some or all of the aluminium in the YAG with gallium. However, this process is not one of phosphorescence. The yellow light is produced by a process known as scintillation, the complete absence of an afterglow being one of the characteristics of the process.

Some rare-earth-doped Sialons are photoluminescent and can serve as phosphors. Europium(II)-doped β-SiAlON absorbs in ultraviolet and visible light spectrum and emits intense broadband visible emission. Its luminance and color does not change significantly with temperature, due to the temperature-stable crystal structure. It has a great potential as a green down-conversion phosphor for white LEDs; a yellow variant also exists (α-SiAlON). For white LEDs, a blue LED is used with a yellow phosphor, or with a green and yellow SiAlON phosphor and a red CaAlSiN3-based (CASN) phosphor.

White LEDs can also be made by coating near-ultraviolet-emitting LEDs with a mixture of high-efficiency europium-based red- and blue-emitting phosphors plus green-emitting copper- and aluminium-doped zinc sulfide . This is a method analogous to the way fluorescent lamps work.

Some newer white LEDs use a yellow and blue emitter in series, to approximate white; this technology is used in some Motorola phones such as the Blackberry as well as LED lighting and the original-version stacked emitters by using GaN on SiC on InGaP but was later found to fracture at higher drive currents.

Many white LEDs used in general lighting systems can be used for data transfer, as, for example, in systems that modulate the LED to act as a beacon.

It is also common for white LEDs to use phosphors other than Ce:YAG, or to use two or three phosphors to achieve a higher CRI, often at the cost of efficiency. Examples of additional phosphors are R9, which produces a saturated red, nitrides which produce red, and aluminates such as lutetium aluminum garnet that produce green. Silicate phosphors are brighter but fade more quickly, and are used in LCD LED backlights in mobile devices. LED phosphors can be placed directly over the die or made into a dome and placed above the LED: this approach is known as a remote phosphor. Some colored LEDs, instead of using a colored LED, use a blue LED with a colored phosphor because such an arrangement is more efficient than a colored LED. Oxynitride phosphors can also be used in LEDs. The precursors used to make the phosphors may degrade when exposed to air.

===Cathode-ray tubes===
Cathode-ray tubes produce signal-generated light patterns in a (typically) round or rectangular format. Bulky CRTs were used in the black-and-white television (TV) sets that became popular in the 1950s, developed into color CRTs in the late 1960s, and used in virtually all color TVs and computer monitors until the mid-2000s. In the late 20th century, advanced electronics made new wide-deflection, &quot;short tube&quot; CRT technology viable, making CRTs more compact, but still bulky and heavy. As the original video display technology, having no viable competition for more than 40 years and dominance for over 50 years, the CRT ceased to be the main type of video display in use only around 2010. In addition to direct-view CRTs, CRT projection tubes were the basis of all projection TVs and computer video projectors of both front and rear projection types until at least the late 1990s.

CRTs have also been widely used in scientific and engineering instrumentation, such as oscilloscopes, usually with a single phosphor color, typically green. Phosphors for such applications may have long afterglow, for increased image persistence. A variation of the display CRT, used prior to the 1980s, was the CRT storage tube, a digital memory device which (in later forms) also provided a visible display of the stored data, using a variation of the same electron-beam excited phosphor technology.

The process of producing light in CRTs by electron-beam excited phosphorescence yields much faster signal response times than even modern (2020s) LCDs can achieve, which makes light pens and light gun games possible with CRTs, but not LCDs. Also in contrast to most other video display types, because CRT technology draws an image by scanning an electron beam (or a formation of three beams) across a phosphor surface, a CRT has no intrinsic &quot;native resolution&quot; and does not require scaling to display raster images at different resolutions; the CRT can display any raster format natively, within the limits defined by the electron beam spot size and, for a color CRT, the dot pitch of the phosphor. Because of this operating principle, CRTs can produce images using either raster and vector imaging methods. Vector displays are impossible for display technologies that have permanent discrete pixels, including all LCDs, plasma display panels, DMD projectors, and OLED (LED matrix, e.g. TFT OLED) panels.

The phosphors can be deposited as either thin film, or as discrete particles, a powder bound to the surface. Thin films have better lifetime and better resolution, but provide less bright and less efficient image than powder ones. This is caused by multiple internal reflections in the thin film, scattering the emitted light.

White (in black-and-white): The mix of zinc cadmium sulfide and zinc sulfide silver, the is the white P4 phosphor used in black and white television CRTs. Mixes of yellow and blue phosphors are usual. Mixes of red, green and blue, or a single white phosphor, can also be encountered.

Red: Yttrium oxide-sulfide activated with europium is used as the red phosphor in color CRTs. The development of color TV took a long time due to the search for a red phosphor. The first red emitting rare-earth phosphor, YVO4:Eu3+, was introduced by Levine and Palilla as a primary color in television in 1964. In single crystal form, it was used as an excellent polarizer and laser material.

Yellow: When mixed with cadmium sulfide, the resulting zinc cadmium sulfide , provides strong yellow light.

Green: Combination of zinc sulfide with copper, the P31 phosphor or , provides green light peaking at 531 nm, with long glow.

Blue: Combination of zinc sulfide with few ppm of silver, the ZnS:Ag, when excited by electrons, provides strong blue glow with maximum at 450 nm, with short afterglow with 200 nanosecond duration. It is known as the P22B phosphor. This material, zinc sulfide silver, is still one of the most efficient phosphors in cathode-ray tubes. It is used as a blue phosphor in color CRTs.

The phosphors are usually poor electrical conductors. This may lead to deposition of residual charge on the screen, effectively decreasing the energy of the impacting electrons due to electrostatic repulsion (an effect known as &quot;sticking&quot;). To eliminate this, a thin layer of aluminium (about 100 nm) is deposited over the phosphors, usually by vacuum evaporation, and connected to the conductive layer inside the tube. This layer also reflects the phosphor light to the desired direction, and protects the phosphor from ion bombardment resulting from an imperfect vacuum.

To reduce the image degradation by reflection of ambient light, contrast can be increased by several methods. In addition to black masking of unused areas of screen, the phosphor particles in color screens are coated with pigments of matching color. For example, the red phosphors are coated with ferric oxide (replacing earlier Cd(S,Se) due to cadmium toxicity), blue phosphors can be coated with marine blue (CoO·&quot;n&quot;) or ultramarine (). Green phosphors based on ZnS:Cu do not have to be coated due to their own yellowish color.

====Black-and-white television CRTs====
The black-and-white television screens require an emission color close to white. Usually, a combination of phosphors is employed.

The most common combination is (blue + yellow). Other ones are (blue + yellow), and (blue + green + red – does not contain cadmium and has poor efficiency). The color tone can be adjusted by the ratios of the components.

As the compositions contain discrete grains of different phosphors, they produce image that may not be entirely smooth. A single, white-emitting phosphor, overcomes this obstacle. Due to its low efficiency, it is used only on very small screens.

The screens are typically covered with phosphor using sedimentation coating, where particles suspended in a solution are let to settle on the surface.

====Reduced-palette color CRTs====
For displaying of a limited palette of colors, there are a few options.

In beam penetration tubes, different color phosphors are layered and separated with dielectric material. The acceleration voltage is used to determine the energy of the electrons; lower-energy ones are absorbed in the top layer of the phosphor, while some of the higher-energy ones shoot through and are absorbed in the lower layer. So either the first color or a mixture of the first and second color is shown. With a display with red outer layer and green inner layer, the manipulation of accelerating voltage can produce a continuum of colors from red through orange and yellow to green.

Another method is using a mixture of two phosphors with different characteristics. The brightness of one is linearly dependent on electron flux, while the other one&#x27;s brightness saturates at higher fluxes—the phosphor does not emit any more light regardless of how many more electrons impact it. At low electron flux, both phosphors emit together; at higher fluxes, the luminous contribution of the nonsaturating phosphor prevails, changing the combined color.

Such displays can have high resolution, due to absence of two-dimensional structuring of RGB CRT phosphors. Their color palette is, however, very limited. They were used e.g. in some older military radar displays.

====Color television CRTs====

The phosphors in color CRTs need higher contrast and resolution than the black-and-white ones. The energy density of the electron beam is about 100 times greater than in black-and-white CRTs; the electron spot is focused to about 0.2 mm diameter instead of about 0.6 mm diameter of the black-and-white CRTs. Effects related to electron irradiation degradation are therefore more pronounced.

Color CRTs require three different phosphors, emitting in red, green and blue, patterned on the screen. Three separate electron guns are used for color production (except for displays that use beam-index tube technology, which is rare). The red phosphor has always been a problem, being the dimmest of the three necessitating the brighter green and blue electron beam currents be adjusted down to make them equal the red phosphor&#x27;s lower brightness. This made early color TVs only usable indoors as bright light made it impossible to see the dim picture, while portable black-and-white TVs viewable in outdoor sunlight were already common.

The composition of the phosphors changed over time, as better phosphors were developed and as environmental concerns led to lowering the content of cadmium and later abandoning it entirely. The was replaced with with lower cadmium/zinc ratio, and then with cadmium-free .

The blue phosphor stayed generally unchanged, a silver-doped zinc sulfide. The green phosphor initially used manganese-doped zinc silicate, then evolved through silver-activated cadmium-zinc sulfide, to lower-cadmium copper-aluminium activated formula, and then to cadmium-free version of the same. The red phosphor saw the most changes; it was originally manganese-activated zinc phosphate, then a silver-activated cadmium-zinc sulfide, then the europium(III) activated phosphors appeared; first in an yttrium vanadate matrix, then in yttrium oxide and currently in yttrium oxysulfide. The evolution of the phosphors was therefore (ordered by B-G-R):
*  –  – 
*  –  –  (1964–?)
*  –  –  or 
*  –  or  – 

====Projection televisions====
For projection televisions, where the beam power density can be two orders of magnitude higher than in conventional CRTs, some different phosphors have to be used.

For blue color, is employed. However, it saturates. can be used as an alternative that is more linear at high energy densities.

For green, a terbium-activated ; its color purity and brightness at low excitation densities is worse than the zinc sulfide alternative, but it behaves linear at high excitation energy densities, while zinc sulfide saturates. However, it also saturates, so or can be substituted. is bright but water-sensitive, degradation-prone, and the plate-like morphology of its crystals hampers its use; these problems are solved now, so it is gaining use due to its higher linearity.

<doc id="88446" wikidata="Q183426" url="?curid=88446" title="List of Portuguese monarchs">
<text>This is a list of Portuguese monarchs who ruled from the establishment of the Kingdom of Portugal, in 1139, to the deposition of the Portuguese monarchy and creation of the Portuguese Republic with the 5 October 1910 revolution.

Through the nearly 800 years in which Portugal was a monarchy, the kings held various other titles and pretensions. Two kings of Portugal, Ferdinand I and Afonso V, claimed the crown of Castile and waged wars in order to enforce their respective claims. Ferdinand I managed to be recognized as King of Galiza in 1369, although his dominance of the region was short-lived. When the House of Habsburg came into power, the kings of Spain, Naples, and Sicily also became kings of Portugal. The House of Braganza brought numerous titles to the Portuguese Crown some honorary, such as the attribution of the title of &quot;Rex Fidelissimus (His Most Faithful Majesty),&quot; and royal titles, such as King of Brazil and then &quot;de jure&quot; Emperor of Brazil.

After the demise of the Portuguese monarchy, in 1910, Portuguese monarchists launched a counter-revolution known as the Monarchy of the North, though the attempted restoration only lasted a month before destruction. With Manuel II&#x27;s death, the Miguelist branch of the house of Braganza became the pretenders to the throne of Portugal. They have all been acclaimed king of Portugal by their monarchist groups.

The monarchs of Portugal all came from a single ancestor, Afonso I of Portugal, but direct lines have sometimes ended. This has led to a variety of royal houses coming to rule Portugal, though all having Portuguese royal lineage. These houses are:

* [[Portuguese House of Burgundy|House of Burgundy]] (1139–1383)
* [[House of Aviz]] (1385–1580)
* [[Philippine dynasty|House of Habsburg]] (1581–1640)
* [[House of Braganza]] (1640–1910)

==House of Burgundy (1139–1383)==
The Portuguese House of Burgundy, known as the Afonsine Dynasty, was the founding house of the Kingdom of Portugal. Prior to the independence of Portugal, the house ruled the feudal County of Portugal, of the Kingdom of Galicia. When Afonso Henriques declared the independence of Portugal, he turned the family from a comital house to a royal house which would rule Portugal for over two centuries. During the Reconquista, the Afonsine Dynasty expanded the country southwards until the definitive conquest of Algarve with Sancho II and the establishment of the Kingdom of Algarve, in 1249, under Afonso III. When Ferdinand I died, a succession crisis occurred between 1383 and 1385. Ferdinand&#x27;s daughter Beatrice of Portugal was proclaimed queen and her husband John I of Castile proclaimed king by the right of his wife. Her legitimacy as a monarch is disputed.

==House of Aviz (1385–1580)==
The House of Aviz, known as the Joanine Dynasty, succeeded the House of Burgundy as the reigning house of the Kingdom of Portugal. The house was founded by John I of Portugal, who was the Grand Master of the Order of Aviz. When King John II of Portugal died without an heir, the throne of Portugal passed to his cousin, Manuel, Duke of Beja. When King Sebastian of Portugal died, the throne passed to his Grand-uncle, Henry of Portugal (he might be called Henry II because Henry, Count of Portugal, father of Alphonso I of Portugal, was the first of that name to rule Portugal). When Henry died, a succession crisis occurred and António, Prior of Crato, was proclaimed António of Portugal.

==House of Habsburg (1581–1640)==
The House of Habsburg, known as the Philippine dynasty, was the house that ruled Portugal from 1581 to 1640. The dynasty began with the acclamation of Philip II of Spain as Philip I of Portugal in 1580, officially recognized in 1581 by the Portuguese Cortes of Tomar. Philip I swore to rule Portugal as a kingdom separate from his Spanish domains, under the personal union known as the Iberian Union.

==House of Braganza (1640–1910)==
The House of Braganza, also known as the Brigantine Dynasty, came to power in 1640, when John II, Duke of Braganza, claimed to be the rightful heir of the defunct House of Aviz, as he was the great-great-grandson of King Manuel I. John was proclaimed King John IV, and he deposed the House of Habsburg in 1640 during the Portuguese Restoration War. The Habsburgs continued to claim the throne of Portugal until the end of the war in the Treaty of Lisbon (1668).

The descendants of Queen Maria II and her consort, King Ferdinand II (a German prince of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha), came to rule in 1853. Portuguese law and custom treated them as members of the House of Braganza, though they were still Saxe-Coburg and Gotha dynasts. This has led some to classify these last four monarchs of Portugal as members of a new royal family, called the House of Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, though this view is not widely held.

<doc id="88448" wikidata="Q1135187" url="?curid=88448" title="List of counties in Vermont">
<text>There are fourteen counties in the U.S. state of Vermont. These counties together contain 255 political units, or places, including 237 towns, 10 cities, 5 unincorporated areas, and 4 gores. Each county has a county seat, often referred to as a &quot;shire town.&quot;

In 1779, Vermont had two counties. The western side of the state was Bennington County and the eastern was Cumberland County. In 1781, three new counties (including then-called Washington that became part of New Hampshire) were created out of Cumberland County, and the remainder of the county was renamed Windham.
Today&#x27;s Washington County was created in 1810 as Jefferson County; it was renamed Washington in 1814.

Essex County, Orleans County, and Caledonia County are commonly referred to as the &quot;Northeast Kingdom&quot;.

The FIPS county code is the five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code which uniquely identifies counties and county equivalents in the United States. The three-digit number is unique to each individual county within a state, but to be unique within the entire United States, it must be prefixed by the state code. This means that, for example, while Addison County, Vermont is 001, Belknap County, New Hampshire and Alachua County, Florida are also 001. To uniquely identify Addison County, Vermont, one must use the state code of 50 plus the county code of 001; therefore, the unique nationwide identifier for Addison County, Vermont is 50001. The links in the column FIPS County Code are to the Census Bureau Info page for that county.

<doc id="88451" wikidata="Q1143558" url="?curid=88451" title="Château de Langeais">
<text>The Château de Langeais is a 15th-century Flamboyant Gothic castle in Indre-et-Loire, France, built on a promontory created by the small valley of the Roumer River at the opening to the Loire Valley. Founded in 992 by Fulk Nerra, Count of Anjou, the castle was soon attacked by Odo I, Count of Blois. After the unsuccessful attack, the now-ruined stone keep was built; it is one of the earliest datable stone examples of a keep. Between 994 and 996, the castle was besieged unsuccessfully twice more. During the conflict between the counts of Anjou and Blois, the castle changed hands several times, and in 1038 Fulk captured the castle again.

After it was destroyed during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, King Louis XI (1461–1483) rebuilt Château de Langeais into what today is one of the best-known examples of late medieval architecture. It is especially noted for its monumental and highly decorated chimneypieces. Restored in the late 19th century, Château de Langeais came under the control of the Institut de France, who owns the site today. It is listed as a &quot;monument historique&quot; by the French Ministry of Culture and is open to the public.

==History==

The 10th century saw the emergence of the castle, which is generally thought to be the second-earliest known, the earliest being Château de Doué-la-Fontaine built by the Count of Blois around 900. The counts of Anjou and Blois had bordering territories, and the powerful lords were rivals; as a result, the border area is home to some of the earliest-known castles. When it was founded in 992 by Fulk Nerra, Count of Anjou, Château de Langeais was made from wood and took the form of a motte-and-bailey. A contemporary chronicler noted that it was built because &quot;[Fulk] had no resting place between Bourgueil and Amboise along the Loire river&quot;. It also had the advantage of being from Tours, a town under the control of Odo I, Count of Blois.

While the land belonged to Fulk, the area was under the control of Odo. When news of the fortification reached Odo he dispatched a force to destroy it. The attack was unsuccessful, and Fulk reinforced the site, building the stone keep in ruins today. To distract Odo from the construction work, which was complete by 994, Fulk carried out intermittent raids on his lands. It has been suggested that the keep&#x27;s shallow foundations and thin walls, at their thickest and on average , demonstrate that it was built in haste.

Though unsuccessful in 992, Odo again tried to capture the castle two years later. This time he called on his Norman, Flemish and Aquitanian allies and the siege of Château de Langeais began in the spring of 994. Fulk led the garrison himself and sent a message to Hugh Capet, King of the Franks, asking for help, and, though Hugh was ill, he promised reinforcements. In the meantime, Odo&#x27;s numbers grew as his allies continued to flock to him. The siege continued into the summer, and Fulk began negotiating with Odo. Richer, a contemporary chronicler favourable to Odo, asserted that Fulk agreed to surrender but later reneged, claiming the agreement was not binding, though it is uncertain whether this was the case. However, the Capetian forces arrived before Fulk was forced to surrender. Faced with the king&#x27;s army, Odo agreed to leave Fulk in peace.
After the siege ended and Odo retreated, Fulk had to deal with hostilities along the western frontier of his lands. Despite Odo&#x27;s agreement with Hugh, the Count of Blois exploited Fulk&#x27;s divided attention to install a force at Château de Châteaudun from which he could move to capture Langeais should the opportunity arise. Odo besieged Château de Langeais in 995. The siege continued into the next year, but in March 996, Odo fell ill and died. With their leader dead, the besieging force left Langeais. With his most troublesome enemy dead, Fulk captured Tours, which had previously been held by the Count of Blois. After Robert, King of the Franks, had taken control of Tours, Fulk turned to the castles of Langeais, Montsoreau, Montrésor and Montbazon to defend the Loire Valley.

Hostilities between the counts of Anjou and Blois were renewed in 1016. During the course of the conflict, Fulk lost control of three castles: Passavant was destroyed, and Montbazon and Langeais were probably captured. By 1032 Château de Langeais was back under Fulk&#x27;s control. However, it was again taken by the forces of Odo II, Count of Blois. Odo II died in battle in 1037 and was succeeded by his son, Theobald; on receiving the news of his rival&#x27;s demise, Fulk set about recapturing Château de Langeais. The siege began in the winter of 1037 and, with no relief forthcoming, the garrison surrendered in the spring of the following year. Fulk set his sights on further territorial gains and successfully captured Château de Chinon away.
Under the Plantagenet kings, the château was fortified and expanded by Richard I of England (Richard the Lionheart). However, King Philippe II of France recaptured the château in 1206. Eventually, though, the English destroyed it during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. The château was rebuilt about 1465 during the reign of King Louis XI. The great hall of the château was the scene of the marriage of Anne of Brittany to King Charles VIII on 6 December 1491, which permanently united Brittany and France.

In 1886 Jacques Siegfried bought Château Langeais and began a restoration programme. He installed an outstanding collection of tapestries and furnishings and bequeathed the château to the Institut de France, which still owns it today. The château is open to the public. It is listed as a &quot;monument historique&quot; by the French Ministry of Culture.

==Layout==
According to contemporaneous chronicler Richer, the castle built by Fulk Nerra in the 990s consisted of a tower and a surrounding enclosure. The 10th-century keep still stands, albeit in a ruinous state. It is the earliest example of Romanesque architecture in the region. It is uncertain where the stone used in construction was quarried. A detailed study has been done on the cost of construction of the tower. It is high, 17.5m wide, and 10m long with walls averaging 1.5m thick. The walls contain of stone and have a total surface area (both inside and out) of . The tower is estimated to have taken 83,000 average working days to complete, most of which was unskilled labour. The wall enclosing the keep stretched for some . The interior rooms are richly decorated.

<text>According to Greek mythology, the Chimera, Chimaera, Chimæra, or Khimaira ( ; ) was a monstrous fire-breathing hybrid creature from Lycia, Asia Minor, composed of different animal parts. Typically, it is depicted as a lion with a goat&#x27;s head protruding from its back and a tail ending with a snake&#x27;s head. Some representations also include dragon&#x27;s wings. It was an offspring of Typhon and Echidna and a sibling of monsters like Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra.

The term &quot;chimera&quot; has come to describe any mythical or fictional creature with parts taken from various animals, to describe anything composed of disparate parts or perceived as wildly imaginative, implausible, or dazzling. In other words, a chimera can be any hybrid creature.

In figurative use, derived from the mythological meaning, &quot;chimera&quot; refers to an unrealistic, or unrealisable, wild, foolish or vain dream, notion or objective.

==Family==

According to Hesiod, the Chimera&#x27;s mother was a certain ambiguous &quot;she&quot;, which may refer to Echidna, in which case the father would presumably be Typhon, though possibly (unlikely) the Hydra or even Ceto was meant instead. However, the mythographers Apollodorus (citing Hesiod as his source) and Hyginus both make the Chimera the offspring of Echidna and Typhon. Hesiod also has the Sphinx and the Nemean lion as the offspring of Orthus, and another ambiguous &quot;she&quot;, often understood as probably referring to the Chimera, although possibly instead to Echidna, or again even Ceto.

==Description==

Homer described the Chimera in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, saying that &quot;she was of divine stock not of men, in the fore part a lion, in the hinder a serpent, and in the midst a goat, breathing forth in terrible wise the might of blazing fire.&quot; Hesiod and Apollodorus gave similar descriptions: a three-headed creature with a lion in front, a fire-breathing goat in the middle, and a serpent in the rear.

== Cumaean Sibyl ==
In a lesser known tale, the Cumaean Sibyl enountered the Chimera in a vision, interpreting it as an omen. She advised her followers to establish harmony in their community to prevent the chaos and destruction that might have been brought about by the Chimera.

==Killed by Bellerophon==

According to Homer, the Chimera, who was reared by Araisodarus (the father of Atymnius and Maris, Trojan warriors killed by Nestor&#x27;s sons Antilochus and Trasymedes), was &quot;a bane to many men&quot;. As told in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the hero Bellerophon was ordered by the king of Lycia to slay the Chimera (hoping the monster would kill Bellerophon). Still, the hero, &quot;trusting in the signs of the gods&quot;, succeeded in killing the Chimera. Hesiod adds that Bellerophon had help in killing the Chimera, saying, &quot;her did Pegasus and noble Bellerophon slay&quot;.

Apollodorus gave a more complete account of the story. Iobates, the king of Lycia, had ordered Bellerophon to kill the Chimera (who had been killing cattle and had &quot;devastated the country&quot;) since he thought that the Chimera would instead kill Bellerophon, &quot;for it was more than a match for many, let alone one&quot;. But the hero mounted his winged horse Pegasus (who had sprung from the blood of Medusa) &quot;and soaring on high shot down the Chimera from the height.&quot;

==Iconography==

Although the Chimera was, according to Homer, situated in foreign Lycia, her representation in the arts was wholly Greek. An autonomous tradition that did not rely on the written word was represented in the visual repertory of the Greek vase painters. The Chimera first appeared early in the repertory of the proto-Corinthian pottery painters, providing some of the earliest identifiable mythological scenes that may be recognized in Greek art. After some early hesitation, the Corinthian type was fixed in the 670s BC; the variations in the pictorial representations suggest multiple origins to Marilyn Low Schmitt. The fascination with the monstrous devolved by the end of the seventh century into a decorative Chimera motif in Corinth, while the motif of Bellerophon on Pegasus took on a separate existence alone. A separate Attic tradition, where the goats breathe fire and the animal&#x27;s rear is serpentine, begins with the confidence that Marilyn Low Schmitt is convinced that there must be unrecognized or undiscovered local precursors. Two vase painters employed the motif so consistently they were given the pseudonyms the Bellerophon Painter and the Chimaera Painter.

==Similar creatures==
A fire-breathing lioness was one of the earliest solar and war deities in Ancient Egypt (representations from 3000 years prior to the Greeks), and influences are feasible. The lioness represented the war goddess and protector of both cultures that would unite as Ancient Egypt. Sekhmet was one of the dominant deities in upper Egypt and Bast in lower Egypt. As the divine mother, and more especially as protector, for Lower Egypt, Bast became strongly associated with Wadjet, the patron goddess of Lower Egypt.

In the Etruscan civilization, the Chimera appears in the Orientalizing period that precedes Etruscan Archaic art. The Chimera appears in Etruscan wall paintings of the fourth century BC.

In the Indus Valley Civilisation, the Chimera is depicted in many seals. There are different kinds of Chimera composed of animals from the Indian subcontinent. It is not known what the Indus people called the Chimera. 

Although the Chimera of antiquity was forgotten in Medieval art, chimerical figures appear as embodiments of the deceptive, even satanic, forces of raw nature. They were depicted with a human face and a scaly tail, as in Dante&#x27;s vision of Geryon in &quot;Inferno&quot; xvii.7–17, 25–27, hybrid monsters, more akin to the Manticore of Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; (viii.90), provided iconic representations of hypocrisy and fraud well into the seventeenth century through a symbolic representation in Cesare Ripa&#x27;s &quot;Iconological&quot;.

==Classical sources==
The myths of the Chimera may be found in the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; of Pseudo-Apollodorus (book 1), the &quot;Iliad&quot; (book 16) by Homer, the &quot;Fabulae&quot; 57 and 151 by Hyginus, the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (book VI 339 by Ovid; IX 648), and the &quot;Theogony&quot; 319ff by Hesiod.

Virgil, in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; (book 5) employs &quot;Chimaera&quot; for the name of a gigantic ship of Gyas in the ship-race, with possible allegorical significance in contemporary Roman politics.

== Hypothesis about origin ==

Pliny the Elder cited Ctesias and quoted Photius identifying the Chimera with an area of permanent gas vents that still may be found by hikers on the Lycian Way in southwest Turkey. Called in Turkish, &quot;Yanartaş&quot; (flaming rock), the area contains some two dozen vents in the ground, grouped in two patches on the hillside above the Temple of Hephaestus approximately 3 km north of Çıralı, near ancient Olympos, in Lycia. The vents emit burning methane thought to be of metamorphic origin. The fires of these were landmarks in ancient times and were used for navigation by sailors.
The Neo-Hittite Chimera from Carchemish, dated 850–750 BC, which is now housed in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, is believed to be a basis for the Greek legend. It differs, however, from the Greek version in that a winged body of a lioness also has a human head rising from her shoulders.

==Use for Chinese mythological creatures==

Some western scholars of Chinese art, starting with Victor Segalen, use the word &quot;chimera&quot; generically to refer to winged leonine or mixed species quadrupeds, such as &quot;bixie&quot;, &quot;tianlu&quot;, and even &quot;qilin&quot;.

<text>Baccarat (; ) is a commune in the Meurthe-et-Moselle department in the Grand Est region of north-eastern France.

The commune has been awarded three flowers by the &quot;National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom&quot; in the &quot;Competition of cities and villages in Bloom&quot;.

==Geography==
Baccarat lies in the district (&quot;&quot;) of Lunéville in the department of Meurthe-et-Moselle.

Baccarat is located some 25 km south-east of Lunéville and 30 km north-west of Saint-Dié-des-Vosges in the Meurthe river valley between the Deneuvre plateau and the wooded hills of Grammont. Access to the commune is by the Route nationale N59 from Bertrichamps in the south-east which passes through the heart of the commune east of the town and continues north-west to join the N333 south-east of Lunéville. The D590 also goes from Bertrichamps and passes through the town continuing north-west to Azerailles. The D19 goes north from the village to Gélacourt. The D935 goes north-east from the town to Merviller and also south-west, changing to the D435 at the departmental border, to Ménil-sur-Belvitte. A railway also passes through the commune with a station near the town and the railway line coming from Azerailles in the north-west continuing to Bertrichamps in the south-east. The commune has a large forest in the east with the rest of the commune mixed forest and farmland. The Meurthe river passes through the commune and the town from the south-east flowing north—west to eventually join the Moselle at Custines. The &quot;Ruisseau des Bingottes&quot; rises east of the commune and joins the Meurthe in the south of the commune.

==History==
Baccarat was originally a suburb of the city of Deneuvre which has Roman origins. The name &quot;Baccarat&quot; comes perhaps from &quot;Bacchi-ara&quot; (&quot;Altar of Bacchus&quot;) which was the name of a Roman castellum of which there remains a relic called the &quot;Tower of Bacha&quot; on the heights of Deneuvre.

The Castellany belonged to the Diocese of Metz. In 1305 Henri, first lord of Blâmont from the House of Salm, dedicated Deneuvre for the Bishop of Metz and, to ensure its safety, he built the Tower of Voués at the bottom of the spur. A suburb formed at its foot: this was the origin of Baccarat (which has been spelt &quot;Bacquarat, Bakarroit, Beckarrat&quot;, and &quot;Backarrat&quot;). The name &quot;Baccarat&quot; appeared for the first time in 1291.

In 1459 the city was best known for its drapers as well as wine. Louis XV authorized the creation of a glassworks in 1764 at the instigation of the Bishop of Metz who was anxious to sell the important local production of firewood. A glassworks named Antoine Renaut responded to the authorisation. The works became a crystal glassworks in 1817 and was sold to the &quot;Compagnie des Cristalleries&quot; in 1881 subsequently achieving worldwide fame under the name of Baccarat. The growing number of workers enabled the development of the commune with the construction of housing, schools, shops, roads, and small industries but the war marked a halt to this development.

On the eve of the First World War the city was home to the 20th Batailion of Foot Chasseurs at the Haxo barracks - some buildings of which remain today. The period between the two world wars was marked by the construction of the church, the bridge, and the town hall (1924). During the Second World War there was much damage to the city including the destruction of the church in October 1944. Liberated by the French 2nd Armoured Division on 31 October 1944, the city resumed its industrial expansion in 1945. The reconstruction of the church was done in 1953.

<doc id="88459" wikidata="Q1982745" url="?curid=88459" title="Spanish Revolution of 1936">
<text>The Spanish Revolution was a social revolution that began at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, following the attempted coup to overthrow the Second Spanish Republic and arming of the worker movements and formation of militias to fight the Nationalists. It featured takeover of power at local levels by the Spanish workers&#x27; organizations and social movements, seizure and reorganization of economic facilities directed by trade union groups and local committees, and widespread implementation of socialist, more narrowly, libertarian socialist and anarchist organizational principles throughout various portions of the Republican zone, primarily Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia, and parts of the Valencian Community. 

Much of the economy of Spain was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%. Factories were run through worker committees, and agrarian areas became collectivized and run as libertarian socialist communes. Many small businesses, such as hotels, barber shops, and restaurants, were also collectivized and managed by their former employees. The revolutionary principles implemented with the revolution continued to evolve as much as the Republican zone existed, until the end of the civil war with the victory of the Nationalists.

The character of the revolution has been described as collectivist and pluralist, carried out by a variety of distinct, often mutually competitive and hostile, political forces and parties; the main forces behind the socioeconomic and political changes were the anarcho-syndicalists of the (CNT, National Confederation of Labor) and the (FAI, Iberian Anarchist Federation), the revolutionary socialists of the (PSOE, Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party), and also the Marxist party (POUM, Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification).

The collectivization effort, which took place rather in agriculture than in industry, was primarily organized by the CNT and the UGT; the collectives could be organized wholly by one of the two trade unions, or by both of them as joint organizations, with the POUM, the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) and sometimes the Republican Left also participating in some areas. Along with collectivization, the revolution produced a variety of other changes, including socialization of industry, which meant workers&#x27; control over enterprises or, more broadly, over an entire branch of production; in order to achieve the latter, small production and trade plants were disestablished, and their personnel was concentrated in bigger plants, or grouped together and coordinated into cartels.

The late Second Spanish Republic and the Nationalists under Francisco Franco suppressed the revolution in their respective territories after its third phase in 1937.

== History ==
On 17 July 1936, the Spanish Coup of July 1936 began. On 18 July, the ongoing military uprising led to a collapse of the republican state (four governments succeeded each other in a single day) and to the coercive structures of the state being dissolved or paralyzed in the places where the coup plotters did not seize power. By then, the CNT had approximately 1,577,000 members and the UGT had 1,447,000 members. On 19 July, the uprising reached Catalonia, where the workers took up arms, stormed the barracks, erected barricades, and eventually defeated the military.

=== First phase of the revolution (July–September 1936): &quot;The summer of anarchy&quot; ===
The CNT and UGT unions called a general strike from 19 to 23 July, in response to both the military uprising and the apparent apathy of the state towards it. Despite the fact that there were specific records in previous days of the distribution of weapons among civilian sectors, it was during the General Strike when groups of trade unionists, linked to the convening unions and smaller groups, assaulted many of the weapons depots of the state forces, independently of whether they were in revolt against the government or not.

Already in these first weeks, two groups were established within the anarcho-syndicalist revolutionary sectors: the radical group, fundamentally linked to the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI) and through it to the CNT, which understood the phenomenon in which it participated as a traditional revolution; and the possibilist group, made up of members of a more moderate sector of the CNT, which expressed the convenience of participating in a broader front, later called the Popular Antifascist Front (FPA), the result of adding the unions to the electoral coalition Popular Front.

At the same time, administrative structures were formed outside the state, most of a local or regional character, but exceeding such limits in specific cases; some of the most important were:
* Central Committee of Antifascist Militias of Catalonia
* Popular Executive Committee of Valencia
* Regional Defense Council of Aragon
* Malaga Public Health Committee
* Gijón War Committee
* Popular Committee of Sama de Langreo
* Santander Defense Council
* Madrid Defense Council
* Council of the Cerdanya
* Antifascist Committee of Ibiza

In a few days, the fronts of the Spanish Civil War were established, one of the main fronts, in the context of the revolution, being that of Aragon. On 24 July 1936, the first voluntary militia left Barcelona in the direction of Aragon. It was the Durruti Column, of around 3,000 people, mostly workers coordinated by Buenaventura Durruti, who first implemented libertarian communism in the municipalities through which they passed. In addition, other popular military structures were formed, such as the Iron Column and the Red and Black Column, the latter also departing for Aragon. All this movement gave rise to an extraordinary concentration of anarchists in parts not taken by the rebel military. The arrival, on the one hand, of the thousands of anarchist militiamen from Catalonia and Valencia, and the existence, on the other, of a large rural Aragonese popular base allowed for the progressive development of the largest collectivist experiment of the revolution.

During this first phase most of the Spanish economy was brought under the control of workers organized by the unions; mainly in anarchist areas such as Catalonia. This phenomenon extended to 75% of the total industrial sector, but in the areas of socialist influence, the rate wasn&#x27;t so high. The factories were organized by workers&#x27; committees, the agricultural areas became collectivized and functioned as libertarian communes. Even places such as hotels, hairdressers, means of transport, and restaurants were collectivized and managed by their own workers.

The British author George Orwell, best known for his anti-authoritarian works &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, was a soldier in the Lenin Division of the CNT-allied (POUM; Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification). Orwell meticulously documented his first-hand observations of the civil war, and expressed admiration for the social revolution in his book &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;.

The communes were operated according to the basic principle of &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot; In some places, money was eliminated, replaced by vouchers. Under this system, the cost of goods was often little more than a quarter of the previous cost. During the revolution, 70% of rural areas were expropriated in Catalonia, about 70% in Eastern Aragon, 91% in the republican sector of Extremadura, 58% in Castilla-La Mancha, 53% in republican Andalusia, 25% in Madrid, 24% in Murcia, and 13% in the Valencian Community. 54% of the expropriated area of republican Spain was collectivized, according to IRA data. The provinces where rural communes became most important were those of Ciudad Real – where 1,002,615 hectares (98.9% of cultivated lands) were collectivized in 1938 – and Jaén – where 685,000 hectares (76.3% of cultivated lands) were collectivized, leaving the rest of the republican provinces far behind. Many communes held out until the end of the war. Anarchist communes produced at a more efficient rate than before being collectivized, with productivity increasing by 20%. The newly liberated zones worked on entirely libertarian principles; decisions were made through councils of ordinary citizens without any bureaucracy.

In Aragon, where libertarian communism was proclaimed as the columns of libertarian militias passed, approximately 450 rural communes were formed, practically all of them in the hands of the CNT, with around 20 led by the UGT.

In the Valencian area, 353 communes were established, 264 led by the CNT, 69 by the UGT and 20 with mixed CNT-UGT leadership. One of its main developments was the Unified Levantine Council for Agricultural Export (, CLUEA) and the total socialization of the industries and services of the city of Alcoy.

In Catalan industry, the CNT workers&#x27; unions took over numerous textile factories, organized the trams and buses in Barcelona, established collective enterprises in fishing, in the footwear industry, and even in small retail stores and public shows. In a few days, 70% of industrial and commercial companies in Catalonia – in which, by itself, two-thirds of the industry of Spain was concentrated – had become the property of the workers.

Alongside the economic revolution, there was a spirit of cultural and moral revolution: the libertarian athenaeums became meeting places and authentic cultural centers of theoretical education, in which were organized literacy classes, talks on health, excursions to the countryside, public access libraries, theatrical performances, political gatherings, sewing workshops, etc. Numerous rationalist schools were founded, which expanded the existing offers of athenaeums and union centers and in which the educational postulates of Francesc Ferrer i Guardia, Ricardo Mella, Leo Tolstoy, and Maria Montessori were carried out. Similarly, in the social field, some traditions were considered as types of oppression, and bourgeois morality was also seen as dehumanizing and individualistic. Anarchist principles defended the conscious freedom of the individual and the natural duty of solidarity among human beings as an innate tool for the progress of societies. Thus, for example, during the revolution, women achieved the right to abortion in Catalonia, the idea of consensual free love became popular, and there was a rise in naturism.

However, the social effects of the revolution were less drastic than the economic ones; while there were some social changes in larger urban areas (Barcelona emphasised a &quot;proletarian style&quot; and Catalonia set up inexpensive abortion facilities), the attitudes of the lower classes remained fairly conservative and there was comparatively little emulation of Russian-style &quot;revolutionary morality&quot;.

Public order also varied substantially, getting by without the classic forces of public order (the police, Civil Guard, courts, and the army), which were supplanted by the Control Patrols made up of volunteers, the popular militias, and the neighborhood assemblies that were intended to resolve problems that arose. The doors of many prisons were opened, freeing the prisoners, among whom there were many politicians but also common criminals, some prisons being demolished.

The anti-fascist Carlo Rosselli, who before Mussolini&#x27;s accession to power was professor of economics in the University of Genoa, put his judgment in the following words:

But despite the de facto decomposition of state power, on 2 August the government took one of its first measures to regain control against the revolution, with the creation of the &quot;Volunteer Battalions&quot;, the embryo of the Spanish Republican Army. Overwhelmed by the revolutionary phenomenon, it also promulgated some symbolic decrees:

* 18 July: Decree declaring the military who participated in the coup to be unemployed.
* 25 July: Decree declaring government employees who sympathize with the coup plotters to be unemployed.
* 25 July: Decree of intervention in industry.
* 3 August: Decree of seizure of the railways.
* 3 August: Decree of intervention in the sale prices of food and clothing.
* 8 August: Decree of seizure of rustic properties.
* 13 August: Decree of closure of religious institutions.
* 19 August (Catalonia): Decree of socialization and unionization of the economy.
* 23 August: Decree of the creation of the People&#x27;s Courts.

The first tensions also arose between the strategy of the anarchists and the policy of the Communist Party of Spain and its extension in Catalonia, the PSUC; and on 6 August members of the PSUC left the Catalan autonomous government because of anarcho-syndicalist pressures.

=== Second phase of the Revolution (September–November 1936): &quot;First Government of Victory&quot; ===

Both in this stage and in the previous one, the state was usually limited to legislating in accordance with the of the revolution. However, due to the need for military measures against the rebellious military, from October–November 1936 the unions began to cede control of the columns to the state for the Defense of Madrid, which was directed by a semi-independent body – the Madrid Defense Council, in which all the Popular Front parties were represented, in addition to the anarchists. The beginning of all this progressively greater agreement and rapprochement between the Popular Front parties and the unions was reflected in the formation of Largo Caballero&#x27;s &quot;first Government of Victory&quot; on 4 September.

Among the measures aimed at legitimizing the activity of the revolutionaries were:
* 17 September: Decree of seizure of convicts&#x27; estates by the People&#x27;s Courts.
* 10 October: Decree creating Emergency Juries.
* 22 October (Catalonia): Decree on collectivisations and workers&#x27; control.

Despite this apparent concession to the revolutionaries, the government did not actively intervene in the development of the revolution, as its main objective was to promote and strengthen the army as the foundation stone of the centralized state. In addition to the repeated attempts at the dissolution of the popular war and defense committees, they decreed:

* 16 September: Decree taking government control of the Rearguard Vigilance Militia.
* 28 September: Decree for the voluntary transfer of heads and officers of the popular militias to the Army.
* 29 September: Decree of application of the Code of Military Justice to popular militias.

As the war dragged on, the spirit of the first days of the revolution lessened and friction between the diverse members of the Popular Front began, in part due to the policies of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE), which were established by the foreign ministry of the Stalinist Soviet Union, the largest source of foreign aid to the republic.

The PCE defended the idea that the ongoing Civil War made it necessary to postpone the ongoing social revolution until the republicans won the war. The PCE advocated not to antagonize the middle classes, the grassroots of the republican parties, which could be harmed by the revolution and side with the enemy. In the Popular Front government, there were parties such as the Republican Left, Republican Union, and the Republican Left of Catalonia, supported by the votes and interests of the middle class (civil servants, liberal professionals, small merchants, and landowning peasants).

The anarchists and the POUMistas (left communists) disagreed with the PCE, understanding that the war and revolution were one and the same. They believed that the war was an extension of class struggle, and that the proletariat had defeated the military precisely because of this revolutionary impulse that they had been carrying for years and not because of defending a bourgeois republic. The nationalists represented precisely the class that these revolutionaries were fighting: the rich capitalists, the landowners, the Church, the Civil Guard, and the colonial army.

The militias of the parties and groups that were against the Popular Front government soon found government aid cut off, and their ability to act reduced. Consequently, republicans slowly began to reverse the recent changes made in most areas. During this period, some revolutionary structures approved new programs that subordinated them to the government, which gave rise to the dissolution or beginning of absorption, appropriation, and intervention of the revolutionary structures by the republican state government. The situation in most Republican-held areas slowly began to revert largely to its prewar conditions.

An exception was the consolidation of the collectivist process in Aragon, where thousands of libertarian militiamen from Valencia and Catalonia arrived, and where, before the start of the Civil War, there was the most important anarcho-syndicalist labor base affiliated with the CNT in all of Spain. In the final weeks of September 1936, the assembly called in Bujaraloz by the Regional Committee of the CNT of Aragon, with delegations of the towns and confederated columns, following the directives proposed on 15 September 1936, in Madrid by the National Plenary of Regional members of the CNT, proposed to all political and union sectors the formation of Regional Defense Councils confederated with a National Defense Council that would perform the functions of the central government, and agreed to the creation of the Regional Defense Council of Aragon, which celebrated its first assembly on 15 October of the same year.

Despite this, on 26 September the most radical and anarchist sectors of Catalonia, dominated by the possibilists, began a policy of collaboration with the state, integrating themselves into the autonomous government of the , which was reborn in place of the Central Committee of Antifascist Militias of Catalonia, which dissolved itself on 1 October. On the other hand, on 6 October the Regional Defense Council of Aragon was legalized and regulated by decree. The proposed National Defense Council was regulated, aborting its development. Faced with this apparent tolerance, on 9 October a decree by the Generalitat outlawed all local committees in Catalonia, formally replacing them with the municipal councils of the FPA. All these concessions to the institutions were considered by some as a betrayal of the classical principles of anarchism, and received harsh criticism from colleagues.

=== Third phase of the Revolution (November 1936 – January 1937): &quot;Second Government of Victory&quot; ===
On 2 November, the Popular Executive Committee of Valencia approved a new action program that subordinated it to the policy of Largo Caballero&#x27;s republican government, which included the CNT members Juan García Oliver, Juan López Sánchez, Federica Montseny, and Juan Peiró. During this month, the Iron Column decided to briefly take Valencia, in protest at the shortage of supplies provided by the Popular Executive Committee, subsequently leading to clashes in the streets of the city between libertarian militias and communist groups, leaving more than 30 dead.

On 14 November, the Durruti Column arrived in Madrid, after giving in to the pressure of the possibilists, who demanded collaboration with the state. On 20 November, Buenaventura Durruti died under suspicious circumstances, fighting in the battle of Madrid, where he had arrived with more than a thousand militiamen from the Front of Aragon.

On 17 December, the Moscow daily &quot;Pravda&quot; published an editorial that read: &quot;The purge of Trotskyists and anarcho-syndicalists has already begun in Catalonia; it has been carried out with the same energy as in the Soviet Union.&quot; The Stalinists had already begun the liquidation of any anti-fascists, collectivizations, and other revolutionary structures that did not submit to the directives of Moscow.

On 23 December, the Gijón War Committee was transformed by decree into the Interprovincial Council of Asturias and León, which was regulated by the republican government and was more moderate in its policies, at the same time as it officially recognized the formation of the National Defense Committee. On 8 January 1937, the Popular Executive Committee of Valencia was dissolved.

During this stage, the government definitely controlled the anarchist popular militias, dissolving them so that they were compulsorily integrated into the Spanish Republican Army, which was under the command of professional officers.

=== The end of the revolution (January 1937 – May 1937) ===
On 27 February 1937, the government banned the FAI&#x27;s newspaper , thus initiating the period during which most of the publications critical of the government began to suffer censorship. The next day it prohibited the police from belonging to political parties or unions, a measure adopted by the Catalan regional government on 2 March. On 12 March, the Generalitat approved an order demanding the seizure of all weapons and explosive materials from non-militarized groups. More confrontations began between the sectors of the FPA; and on 27 March the anarchist advisers of the Catalan autonomous government resigned. During the month of March, the &quot;militarization&quot; of the militias was completed, transforming them into a regular army subject to its disciplinary and hierarchal regimes, against which many anarchist voices rose up.

On 17 April, the day after the ministers of the CNT returned to the Generalitat, a force of Carabineros in Puigcerdá demanded the CNT workers&#x27; patrols hand over control of customs on the border with France. Simultaneously, the Civil Guard and Assault Guard were sent to Figueras, and other towns throughout the province of Girona, to remove control of the workers&#x27; organizations from the police, dissolving the autonomous Council of Cerdanya. Simultaneously, in Barcelona, the Assault Guard proceeded to disarm the workers in public view, in the streets.

During May 1937, confrontations between the supporters of the revolution and those opposed to it intensified. On 13 May, after the events of the Barcelona May Days, the two Communist ministers, Jesús Hernández Tomás and Vicente Uribe, proposed to the government that the National Labor Confederation (CNT) and the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) be punished, bringing into practice repression against the latter party. On 16 May, Largo Caballero resigned, which was followed by the formation of a socialist government under Juan Negrín, but without support from anarchists or revolutionaries.

Fenner Brockway, Secretary of the ILP in England who traveled to Spain after the May events in Catalonia (1937), expressed his impressions in the following words:

=== Related subsequent events ===
On 25 May 1937, the FAI was excluded from the People&#x27;s Courts. On 8 June, the government issued a decree by which it temporarily outlawed rural communes that had not yet been dissolved. On 14 June, a new government of the Generalitat was formed, also without the anarchists and revolutionaries. On 15 June, the POUM was outlawed and its executive committee was arrested. On the 16 June the 29th Division (formerly the POUM&#x27;s Lenin Division) was dissolved.

In August 1937, criticism of the USSR was prohibited by means of a government circular. In this month, the central government also ordered the dissolution of the Aragón Defense Council, practically the last remaining body of revolutionary power, which was militarily occupied by republican army troops on 10 August. Joaquín Ascaso, its president, was arrested. Likewise, the eleventh communist division attacked various committees of the Aragonese people and dissolved collective agricultural production, which soon after was reorganized. On 7 September, the government reauthorized religious worship in private, one of its many measures to reestablish the power of the government in the republican zone, while in Barcelona there were demonstrations against the dissolution of the anarcho-syndicalist publication . On 16 September, political rallies were prohibited in Barcelona. On 26 September, the Asturian Council proclaimed itself the Sovereign Council of Asturias and León, independent from the Second Spanish Republic.

On 21 October, a demonstration by anarchist and socialist militants took place in front of the San Miguel de los Reyes prison in Valencia, threatening to break down the doors if the prisoners were not freed. On 12 November, the CNT withdrew from the FPA committees.

On 6 January 1938, the government published a decree prohibiting all new issuances of banknotes and coins by committees, municipalities, corporations, etc.; and a period of one month was given for them to be withdrawn from circulation, in an attempt to end the last remnants of the revolution.

During that year many of the large landowners returned and demanded the return of their property. Collectivization was progressively annulled despite its popular support.

Sam Dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish revolution, which he claimed &quot;came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history&quot;.

== Social revolution ==
=== Economic ===
The most notable aspect of the social revolution was the establishment of a libertarian socialist economy based on coordination through decentralized and horizontal federations of participatory industrial collectives and agrarian communes. Andrea Oltmares, professor in the University of Geneva, in the course of an address of some length, said:

The key developments of the revolution were those related to the ownership and development of the economy in all its phases: management, production, and distribution. This was accomplished through widespread expropriation and collectivization of privately owned resources, in adherence to the anarchist belief that private property is authoritarian in nature.

Numerous experiments with management and control of workers and agrarian collectivizations were carried out throughout the republican territory. In some towns and cities, the transformations were spontaneous and took different paths. However, in a large number of cases the first steps were in imitation of those taken in Barcelona.

==== Socialized industry ====
After the coup d&#x27;état and the beginning of the civil war, many owners in the republican zone were assassinated, imprisoned, or exiled, thus leaving a multitude of companies and factories without direction. This situation led to the takeover of such entities, sometimes amounting to entire industries, by the unions. Within the industrial sphere the revolution was carried out in different ways. These differences radiated from numerous factors: the disappearance of the owner, the strength and political orientation of the workers&#x27; organizations, the existence of foreign capital in the company itself, or even the destination of its products. Faced with this situation, there were three major orientations:
* Workers&#x27; control occurred where the existence of foreign capital limited the revolutionary capacity of the workers
* Nationalization occurred in companies with management sympathetic to Soviet communism, and later in all war industries
* Socialization occurred in those industries that did not have a large volume of foreign capital and the political affiliation approached or defended the postulates of the CNT-FAI.

At the beginning of the war, 70% of all the industry in Spain was in Catalonia, which, as the nerve center of the CNT and Spanish anarchism, gave it a great importance within the revolutionary process, being one of the places where some of the most radical revolutionary experiments took place. In all the places where industrial measures were carried out, it is necessary to look at certain factors, such as the type of industry or the implantation of the different workers&#x27; organizations and political parties, especially at the beginning of the revolution, when the actions were more broad, when workers had greater freedom of movement and the state had no capacity to oppose them.

===== Socialization =====
Socialization consisted of the management of the industry by the workers themselves. On the practical level, it resulted in the abolition of private property by collective management and property, based on the principles of direct action and the anti-authoritarianism of anarchism. In this case, management fell to a board of directors made up of less than fifteen people, in which all the productive and service levels of the company were involved, and in which the trade union centrals had to be proportionally represented. This council was elected in a workers&#x27; assembly to which they were responsible. The benefits were distributed among: workers, company, and for social purposes. Within each company was a reserve fund that the assembly could decide to use for social purposes, such as contributions to regional credit unions, the unemployed, or as investments in education and health.

===== Nationalization =====
Nationalization denoted the management of the industry by the state. It resulted in the abolition of private property and management. The boards of directors were controlled by the state, and the benefits were adduced to the state and the company itself. It was the choice that the Communist Party defended, since in this way it could weaken the economic power that the CNT held.

===== Worker control =====
Worker control involved the creation of workers&#x27; committees that would be in charge of controlling working conditions, the cash movements of the companies, and the control of production of companies that remained in private hands, excepting only those that did not have enough personnel to meet the conditions of belonging to a committee. These committees were made up of between three and nine members, they were made up of representatives of the two unions, in a proportional manner, and of all the services and industries that the company dealt with. These representatives were elected in an assembly of the center, an assembly in which it was decided whether a committee also had the right to sign for the movements of funds, the frequency of meetings between the committee and the patron, and the frequency of meetings between them. Committee membership was not remunerated, a term lasted two years, with eligibility for reelection. Members were responsible, for their management of a company, to the assembly of the company and to the General Council of Industry. A committee approved the hours, salary increases and decreases, changes of categories or workplace, and notifications of absences to workers. A committee had to meet once a week to discuss the employer&#x27;s proposals and to ensure compliance with the official provisions. The employer representation still had the power of the legal representation of the company, the power to contract, the custody of the box, and the signature and the fixing of their remuneration. If the company had a corporation or other commercial model as a legal entity, a member of the committee had to attend the council meetings with voice but without a vote.

==== Salary ====
Remuneration for work was one of the points of friction between the anarchist and Marxist views during the revolutionary stage. While the anarchist organizations defended a single family salary, the Marxist organizations defended a staggered salary according to the type of work that was carried out.
These differences were motivated by the differing conceptions of the individual and by motivating the individual as a producer. In the first place, while anarchism understands the individual as a subject with needs that must be met, Marxism understands the individual as a producer. Secondly, anarchism holds to the concept that the worker will strive to produce and improve the process while controlling the productive activity. Marxism, on the other hand, understands that the worker will try harder in exchange for receiving a higher remuneration.

==== Examples of collectivized industries ====

===== Film industry =====
The CNT&#x27;s Entertainment Union was a model of organization and operation in the confederated media. It was significant that, between 20 and 25 July, the cinemas and theaters of Barcelona were one of the first and most resoundingly successful occupations by the activists from Barcelona&#x27;s CNT. On 26 July, a Technical Commission was put in charge of preparing a project that defined the new framework of work in cinemas and theaters. That same day, the Catalan Generalitat, overwhelmed by events, created the which was not successful; the production of workers organized through the CNT union completely took over production.

From 6 August to May 1937, revolutionary enthusiasm organized and energized all the cinematographic and theatrical activities in Barcelona. The project began by standardizing wages for all job types in the film industry. Sickness, disability, old age, and forced unemployment benefits were established permanently. This whole system employed about 6,000 people and supported 114 cinemas, 12 theaters, and 10 music halls during that period. An opera company was even created at the Tivoli theater, in an attempt to bring the genre closer to the general public.

It can be said that it was one of the sectors that functioned the best economically, even building some cinemas such as the Ascaso (today&#x27;s Vergara). Others were reformed or were finished building, such as the Durruti cinema (now the Arenas cinema).

At the political level, the collectivization of cinema was a new way of understanding art radically opposed to the bourgeois and capitalist system. There was no unity of criteria in the creative process, dogmatism was not allowed behind the scenes, and the &quot;seventh art&quot; incorporated a new form of journalism by taking cameras out into the street, to film what was happening there. A popular mobilization emerged to tell what they saw, and the message emerged as counter-information. The information of the people thus replaced that of power.

Between 1936 and 1937, more than a hundred films were produced, promoted by the production company and the distributor created by the CNT. The documentary genre was undoubtedly the most accomplished, as war news inevitably pushed out any other activity. SIE Films (Syndicate of the Entertainment Industry) and Spartacus Films were created for the production of films. The Union had two large studios with three &quot;plateaux&quot; for filming, and the &quot;Palace of Belgium&quot; was set up on the premises of Montjuïc, for auxiliary services of sets and extras. However, the repression of May 1937 strangled the Social Revolution in the streets of Barcelona and, although films continued to be made, the previous production rate slowed considerably.

Anarchist film production was a large part of the creative life in Catalonia at the time; and it spread to Aragon, Madrid, and Levante through different models, adapting to the circumstances of towns and cities and the working people who made them possible. Although productive activity in Madrid was less important than in Barcelona, 24 films were shot, both documentaries and fictional.

===== Woodworking industry =====
Between 7,000 and 10,000 people worked in this industry during the Civil War. Shortly after the general strike, when workers returned to their companies and workshops, woodworkers began to socialize. They began by seizing the companies, and through a general plan to rationalize efforts and resources, they closed the workshops that did not meet sufficient health and safety conditions, regrouping them to have large and clear premises. Although at the beginning there were still small workshops, later they were also added to the socialization.

After a few months of spontaneity, efforts were coordinated until the 8-hour day, standardization of wages, improvement of working conditions, and the increase of production were achieved. Socialization was implemented throughout all phases of production: sawmill, joinery, and carpentry.

A professional school and libraries were created, there was even a Socialized Furniture Fair in 1937. Coordination was achieved with the socialized wood industry of the Levante, to manufacture different types of furniture and not to compete. Although some exchanges are carried out through barter (with other socialized branches, or with some agrarian communities), in most cases they had to use money.

==== The agrarian communities ====
The trend of latifundismo in the Spanish countryside led to widespread unrest among the peasantry. The confiscations of the 19th century had failed to substantially modify the structure of land ownership and the republic&#x27;s agrarian reform process had not fulfilled the expectations for change. Thus, as a result of the coup d&#x27;état, a revolutionary process began in which the peasants expropriated from the landowners and organized self-managed communities based on collective ownership of the means of production. This phenomenon has been called &quot;collectivization&quot;. The collectivities were created through different means. In regions that the nationalists had not seized, the municipalities and the peasants themselves initiated collectivization.

Thus was formed a collective labor regime in which the lands of the aristocrats and landowners were expropriated and joined with the lands of other collectives. Animals, tools, and work were all held and done collectively. Periodic assemblies were held to direct what the community was doing, as well as negotiate with other communities and encourage exchange. Most of these collectives were born in response to the lands that were left empty or were seized by committees after the coup d&#x27;état. The IRA counted between 1,500 and 2,500 communities throughout Spain. These collectives came to be territorially organized as was the case in Aragon, in Castile with the unification of the peasant federations, or in Levante with the creation of the CLUEA. Throughout the war they were present in the political and economic approaches of each faction, being in a way another of the ideological battlefields within the republican side.

The union or departure from the collective community was free. If a small owner wanted to continue working the land on their own, they could do so as long as they did not hire anyone. The UGT-organized National Federation of Land Workers (FNTT), which had more than half a million affiliates, was largely in favor of the collectives.

In Barcelona the communities exercised a management role similar to collectives, without employers, as everything was controlled by their own workers. City services such as urban transport were managed by collective communities. In the countryside of Aragon, the Valencian Community and Murcia, the agrarian communities acted as communes. The business role was joined to that of an institution that replaced the local powers of the municipalities in which they were created, in many cases abolishing money and private property (one of the principles of socialist anarchist society). Some of the most significant Aragonese communities were those of Alcañiz, Alcorisa, Barbastro, Calanda, Fraga, Monzón, and Valderrobres. In mid-February 1937, a congress was held in Caspe, the purpose of which was to create a federation of collectives attended by 500 delegates representing 80,000 Aragonese collectivists. Along the Aragon front, the Anarchist-influenced Council of Aragon, chaired by Joaquín Ascaso, had assumed control of the area. Both the Council of Aragon and these communities were not well regarded by the government of the republic; so, on 4 August the Minister of National Defense, Indalecio Prieto, issued orders to the 11th Division of Commander Enrique Líster to be sent on &quot;maneuvers&quot; to Aragon, and dissolving the Council of Aragon on 11 August.

In Aragon, agrarian collectives were formed that were structured by work groups of between five and ten members. To each work group, the community assigned a piece of land for which it was responsible. Each group elected a delegate who represented their views at community meetings. A management committee was responsible for the day-to-day running of the community. This committee was in charge of obtaining materials, carrying out exchanges with other areas, organizing the distribution of production, and the public works that were necessary. Its members were elected in general assemblies in which all the people who made up the community participated.

In many villages and towns money was even abolished and replaced by vouchers signed or stamped by committees. Although some communities had problems with the republican authorities (e.g. the dissolution in Aragon), others, such as those of Castilla, Region of Murcia, and Andalusia, could function with more or less success until 1939, when they were dissolved by Franco&#x27;s troops.

===== Policy =====

====== Decision making ======
Following libertarian practices, the collectives were governed by structures that can be described as &quot;from the bottom up&quot;. That is, all decisions and appointments were made in assembly. In these assemblies all issues concerning the people were discussed. In these same assemblies the progress of the community and the actions to be taken were debated.

======Federalism======
On a broader organizational level, the communities aspired to organize themselves into federations, following the example of Aragon. There were congresses in favor of the creation of federations of collectives, but in no case was a more elaborate body than in Aragon ever constituted. There were other cases of federalism, such as CLUEA, the managing body for citrus exports in the Levante.

Among the collectivities there was also exchange, either in the form of barter, with their own paper money or with official currency.

====== Environmentalism ======
The Spanish Revolution undertook several environmental reforms that were possibly the largest in the world at the time. Daniel Guérin notes that anarchist territories would diversify crops, extend irrigation, initiate reforestation, and start tree nurseries. Once there was a link discovered between air pollution and tuberculosis, the CNT shut down several metal factories.

===== Economy =====
The collectives were formed in the villages as a result of the abandonment, expropriation, or accumulation of land and work tools by the peasants. They were made up of people who wanted to belong and the work to be done was divided among the different members. In places where money was not abolished, the salary became in most cases a family salary. Accordingly, it was set according to the number of family members, increasing according to whether they were a couple or had children.

====== Money ======
The economic policies of the anarchist collectives were primarily operated according to the basic communist principle of &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot;. One of the most outstanding aspects of the communities was the approach with which they faced the problem of money and the distribution of products. In the villages and towns where money was abolished, different solutions were sought; these ideas varied according to locality and town: vouchers signed or stamped by committees, account books, local coins, ration tables, or individual or family checkbooks. In the cases where money was abolished, it was used to acquire products or tools that the community could not obtain by itself.

====== Obstacles ======
The biggest problems that the communities faced were those consequential of the war itself: shortage of raw materials such as fertilizers, seeds, gear, and tools, or the lack of labor due to the mobilization. They also had great problems in their relationship with the state, as the collectives were an expression of power outside the state and also as ideological rivals of the communism that dominated the government. This is how they suffered discrimination in the financing of the IRA, the CLUEA&#x27;s competition in the Levante, forced unionization in Catalonia, or their forced dissolution in Aragon.

===== State response =====
Once the state was restructured at any of its levels, it tried to stop, direct or at least channel any revolutionary organism. Regarding the collectives, the Minister of Agriculture Uribe drew up a decree of agrarian collectivizations that only sought to channel them. With this decree an excessive importance was given to the individual farmer.

==== The scope of the revolution ====
The figures are often fuzzy. Various numbers have been proposed. Gaston Leval says that there were 3 million people who participated. Vernon Richards talks about 1,500,000. Frank Mintz, in a 1970 study, says it was between 2,440,000 and 3,200,000; but by 1977 he had already revised these figures, placing it at a minimum of 1,838,000 collectivists. Its justification is the following:

=== The revolution in education ===
Within the educational field there were also important experiments, although, as will be seen, these experiences had great drawbacks preventing carrying out more intense work. One of the most significant changes was due to the fact that education went from being a defensive and destructive field of capitalism to being understood as a fundamental pillar of the construction of the new revolutionary society.

==== Primary and secondary education ====
The New Unified School Council (UNSC), created in Catalonia on 27 July 1936, was entrusted with the task of restructuring the educational system in Catalonia. This organization could be understood as a model of public management of education: free, co-educational, secular, use of the vernacular, and unification of the different educational levels. However, the CENU created a Regional Federation of Rationalist Schools that was outside the UNSC system.

In rural areas, the collectivist movement was forced to intervene more directly than in the cities. Either because there were no educational structures before or because there was greater autonomy, in many rural municipalities the community faced local, professional, or municipal expenses. It was also important obey the statutes of some communities that prohibited child labor.

==== Vocational and technical training ====
Within the field of vocational and technical training, various initiatives were developed. In the industrial field, these were largely the result of the unions, which, knowing that they were lacking in technicians and distrusting them, tried to train members of their organizations. Among these initiatives were numerous schools of particular trades: railways, optics, transporters, metallurgists, and departments dedicated to professional training.

In the agricultural field, federations of trade unions carried out this type of initiative, among which we can find the school of secretaries of Levante, the agricultural university of Moncada, the regional institute of agriculture and livestock, and the school of militants of Monzón.

==== Non-Formal and Cultural Education ====
For informal education there were the libertarian athenaeums, or popular social centers in which different informative, cultural, or work tasks were developed. The athenaeums had a very strong tradition where anarchism was strong. However, in the war they even expanded into areas with few CNT roots. In some cases, such as Madrid, these athenaeums came to create schools, have health insurance, and promote other types of services.

Various communities also carried out other initiatives, such as the creation of libraries, artistic activities, a cinema forum, theater groups, athenaeums, the foundation of its own academies, or nursery schools.

==== Problems faced ====
The problems that had to be faced had two different roots: on the one hand, there were the problems typical of a war, to which others that had been dragging down the educational sphere can be added, and on the other, those typical of the rationalist school movement.

* In the first place, it is necessary to point out the poor school attendance in Spain. This problem was exacerbated in rural areas, where a large number of municipalities lacked schools or were in a very precarious situation, with many communities still trying to eradicate child labor.
* In a sense similar to the previous point, one of the problems suffered at a general level, and in the rationalist school, in particular was the lack of trained teachers. This problem, which is inseparable from the structural lack of education, was aggravated in rural areas when it coincided with the summer vacation period. The lack of trained teachers was especially incidental in the libertarian sphere, since most of the people who were in charge of the rationalist schools were militants.
* One of the problems that was tried to solve was the lack of coordination between rationalist centers. In most cases, this coordination occurred informally, on the basis of affinity and proximity. The most interesting response in this regard was the Regional Federation of Rationalist Schools of Catalonia, which planned the creation of an editorial and a Rationalist Norm. However, the federation did not have a remarkable evolution.
* And finally, the scarcity of economic and material resources must be pointed out due to the need to maintain a war economy and the economic downturn to which the collectivist movement was subjected. This lack of resources was a fundamental element in understanding the lack of reorganization of the educational structure, with problems such as the lack of endowments, which was sometimes made up with the repurposing of other buildings.

=== The revolution, the Civil War and the militias ===

The coincidence of the revolution and the Spanish Civil War meant that in the military field various initiatives avre developed coordinated by the new administrations established by the revolutionary wave, most of which would be unsuccessful.

==== The Aragon front ====

This was the first military initiative, developed on 24 July 1936, when the first voluntary militia, the Durruti Column, departed from Barcelona in the direction of Zaragoza. One of the last columns was the Los Aguiluchos Column, which left Barcelona on 28 August in the direction of Huesca. The columns of Barcelona and Lleida headed mainly towards Huesca and Zaragoza, and the Valencian ones towards Teruel, repeatedly besieging the three provincial capitals. At the beginning of September, the Carod-Ferrer Column arrived and was installed around Villanueva de Huerva.

This operation lasted until the end of September, when faced with the imperative of the imminent Battle of Madrid some of the columns gave up their independence, subordinating themselves to the requirements of the government.

==== The Mallorca landings ====
The idea of an expedition to Mallorca had been present since 19 July, when it was taken by the nationalists, along with Ibiza and Formentera. Menorca was the only island in the Balearic archipelago that remained in republican hands. The republicans managed to take back the islands of Ibiza, Formentera, and Cabrera, landing on the island of Mallorca in the area of Punta Amer and Porto Cristo. On 5 September, Bayo&#x27;s column began the withdrawal from Mallorca, which lasted until 12 September, returning to Barcelona.

The so-called &quot;Mallorca landings&quot; could be considered to have been definitively concluded when on 20 September Francoist troops from Mallorca occupied Formentera.

==== The defense of Madrid ====
The last major operation of the confederal militias took place in November 1936. Buenaventura Durruti, one of the main protagonists of the Revolution, died on 20 November 1936. The resistance of the popular militias, together with the reinforcements of the International Brigades, allowed Madrid to resist the attack of the rebels. In the subsequent defense of the city, numerous anarcho-syndicalists intervened, such as the column led by the Madrilenian Cipriano Mera.

Nevertheless, the confederal militias were militarized into the Spanish Republican Army in 1937.

== Criticisms ==
Criticism of the Spanish Revolution has primarily centered around allegations of coercion by anarchist participants (primarily in the rural collectives of Aragon), which critics charge ran contrary to libertarian organizational principles. Bolloten claims that CNT–FAI reports overplayed the voluntary nature of collectivization, and ignored the more widespread realities of coercion or outright force as the primary characteristic of anarchist organization.

He also emphasizes the generally coercive nature of the war climate and anarchist military organization and presence in many portions of the countryside as being an element in the establishment of collectivization, even if outright force or blatant coercion was not used to bind participants against their will.

This charge had previously been made by historian Ronald Fraser in his &quot;Blood of Spain: An Oral History of the Spanish Civil War&quot;, who commented that direct force was not necessary in the context of an otherwise coercive war climate.

Anarchist sympathizers counter that the presence of a &quot;coercive climate&quot; was an unavoidable aspect of the war that the anarchists cannot be fairly blamed for, and that the presence of deliberate coercion or direct force was minimal, as evidenced by a generally peaceful mixture of collectivists and individualist dissenters who had opted not to participate in collective organization. The latter sentiment is expressed by historian Antony Beevor in his &quot;Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939&quot;.

Historian Graham Kelsey also maintains that the anarchist collectives were primarily maintained through libertarian principles of voluntary association and organization, and that the decision to join and participate was generally based on a rational and balanced choice made after the destabilization and effective absence of capitalism as a powerful factor in the region.

There is also focus placed by pro-anarchist analysts on the many decades of organization and shorter period of CNT–FAI agitation that was to serve as a foundation for high membership levels throughout anarchist Spain, which is often referred to as a basis for the popularity of the anarchist collectives, rather than any presence of force or coercion that allegedly compelled unwilling persons to involuntarily participate.

Michael Seidman has suggested there were other contradictions with workers&#x27; self-management during the Spanish Revolution. He points out that the CNT decided both that workers could be sacked for &quot;laziness or immorality&quot; and that all workers should &quot;have a file where the details of their professional and social personalities will be registered&quot;. He also notes that the CNT Justice Minister, García Oliver, initiated the setting up of &quot;labour camps&quot;, and that even the most principled anarchists, the Friends of Durruti, advocated &quot;forced labour&quot;. However, Garcia Oliver explained his idealistic vision of justice in Valencia on 31 December 1936; common criminals would find redemption in prison through libraries, sport, and theatre. Political prisoners would achieve rehabilitation by building fortifications and strategic roads, bridges, and railways, and would receive decent wages. Garcia Oliver believed it made more sense for fascist lives to be saved than for them to be sentenced to death. This is in contrast to the policy of mass annihilation of political opponents enacted in the rebel zone during the war.

Some radical commentators have incorporated their views on limitations of the Spanish Revolution into their theories of anti-capitalist revolution. Gilles Dauvé, for example, uses the Spanish experience to argue that to transcend capitalism, workers must completely abolish both wage labour and capital rather than just self-manage them. 

In his writings on the Spanish Revolution, Leon Trotsky delivered a series of deprecatory criticisms of the various factions including the POUM and reformist left. He attributed the failures of the Spanish Republic to the oscillating position of the leadership, reformist programmes and organisational ineptitude in erecting mass revolutionary parties. He reserved his strongest condemnation for the Stalinist-allied Communist party for their repressive actions of other left-wing factions which ensured the ascendancy of Franco and the Comintern for abandoning the revolution in favour of maintaining diplomatic parity with the West.

<doc id="88468" wikidata="Q513589" url="?curid=88468" title="The Pirate Planet">
<text>The Pirate Planet is the second serial of the 16th season in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 30 September to 21 October 1978. It forms the second serial of the &quot;Key to Time&quot; story arc. It was written by Douglas Adams and features some of his humour.

The tyrant Queen Xanxia (a dual role played by Vi Delmar and Rosalind Lloyd) and the Captain (Bruce Purchase) use the hollow planet Zanak as a spaceship that surrounds smaller planets, including Calufrax, the second segment of the powerful Key to Time in disguise, to plunder the planets&#x27; resources that help keep Xanxia alive.

==Plot==
The Key to Time tracer points the Fourth Doctor and Romana to the cold and boring planet of Calufrax, but when they arrive they find an unusual civilisation living in perpetual prosperity. Although a strange band of people with mysterious powers known as the Mentiads are feared by the society, the Doctor discovers that they are good people but with an unknown purpose. He instead fears the Captain, the planet&#x27;s leader and benefactor. After meeting the Captain on the bridge he learns that they are actually on a hollowed-out planet named Zanak, which has been materialising around other planets to plunder their resources.

After repairing Zanak&#x27;s engines, which were damaged when the planet materialised in the same place as the TARDIS, the Captain plans to take Zanak to Earth. The Doctor finds the true menace controlling the Captain is the ancient tyrant Queen Xanxia, disguised as the Captain&#x27;s nurse, who uses the resources mined from planets in an attempt to gain immortality. Her physical body sits between Time Dams, devices that hold back the ravages of time, as she is old and near death, and a younger version of her is projected via a solid 3D device. Despite the Captain&#x27;s apparent insanity, he is a calculating person who plans to destroy Xanxia. The Mentiads learn that their psychic powers are strengthened by the destruction of entire worlds beneath their feet: As the people on the planets die, their combined psychic force boosts the Mentiad&#x27;s power.

Throughout Zanak, the Key to Time locator has been giving odd signals that seem to indicate that the segment is everywhere. Once the Doctor and Romana see the Captain&#x27;s trophy room of planets, they conclude that Calufrax itself is the segment that they are looking for. The Captain&#x27;s intends to use the gravitational power of all the crushed worlds to essentially drill a hole through the time dams, bypass its fail-safe mechanism, and let time move forward so the queen dies. They use the TARDIS to once again disrupt Zanak&#x27;s materialisation around Earth while the Mentiads sabotage the engines. Xanxia kills the Captain when he finally turns against her and his plan fails. As Calufrax is not a real world, its mass is different and Zanak is unable to consume it. The Doctor, Romana, and the Mentiads destroy the bridge and Xanxia, ending the devastation caused by Zanak&#x27;s travels. The Doctor rigs the system to drop the crushed worlds into the centre of Zanak where they&#x27;ll expand and fill it, except for Calufrax which he sends it off into the time/space continuum where they pick it up later.

==Production==
The original draft for this story was extremely complex, centred on a Time Lord trapped in a giant aggression-absorbing machine and several paradoxes, it had to be heavily simplified by the script editor, Anthony Read.

According to the DVD commentary, the Doctor&#x27;s accident with the console early in the story was staged to explain Baker&#x27;s real-life cut lip, which was due to a dog bite. The scenes in the engine room were filmed at the Berkeley nuclear power station, which made many of the cast and crew rather nervous.

The 16mm location work for this story is still held in the BBC archive.

===Cast notes===
Vi Delmar, who played the old Queen Xanxia (uncredited), asked for extra payment to remove her false teeth in her scenes. David Warwick later played the police commissioner in &quot;Army of Ghosts&quot; (2006) and David Garnier in the audio play &quot;The Harvest&quot;.

==Broadcast and reception==
It was repeated on BBC1 on four consecutive Thursdays from 12 July – 2 August 1979, achieving viewing figures of 2.8, 4.0, 3.3 and 2.9 million respectively.

Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), &quot;An inventive story, The Pirate Planet has matured into a satisfying mixture of the clever and the absurd.&quot; In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker described it as &quot;enjoyable&quot;, especially due to Baker and Tamm&#x27;s performances as well as the Captain and Mr Fibuli. However, they wrote that the other supporting characters were &quot;simply awful&quot;. In 2011, Mark Braxton of &quot;Radio Times&quot; noted a few plot holes and that the budget could not convey the scope of ideas, but he praised the performances and the story&#x27;s playful tone. DVD Talk&#x27;s Justin Felix gave &quot;The Pirate Planet&quot; three and a half out of four stars, describing the story as &quot;quite clever&quot; and &quot;fun&quot;, but felt that it was let down by over-the-top acting. In 2010, Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed the cliffhanger of the third episode as one of the best cliffhangers in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; history.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===
This is one of five &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials that were never novelised by Target Books (the others being &quot;City of Death&quot;, &quot;Shada&quot;, &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot;, and &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot;), in this case because they were unable to come to an agreement with Douglas Adams that would have allowed him or another writer to adapt the script. BBC Books published a novelised version of the serial, written by James Goss, on 5 January 2017. An abridged Target Books edition titled &quot;Doctor Who and the Pirate Planet&quot; was published in paperback 11 March 2021.

===Home media===
It was released on VHS on 3 April 1995. Along with the rest of season sixteen, it was released in North America as part of the &quot;Key to Time&quot; box set, and as an individually available title, on 1 October 2002; the remastered Key To Time Boxset was released in Region 1 on 3 March 2009. A Limited Edition of the &quot;Key to Time&quot; box set (with additional clean-up and extras over the North American release) containing this serial, was released in Region 2 on 24 September 2007. The same set, though not in Limited Edition guise was released in Region 4 on 7 November 2007. The serial is not available separately on DVD in Regions 2 or 4. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 112 on 17 April 2013.

<text>Shada is a story from the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Written by the series&#x27; script editor Douglas Adams, it was intended as the final serial of the 1979–80 season (season 17) but was never originally completed, owing to strike action at the BBC during studio recording. Entering production as a six-part story (6 x 25-minute episodes) in 1979, the story was later revised to be broadcast as a four-part story (4 x 25-minute episodes) in 1980. Ultimately however, the story was never completed in either format.

The BBC released a completed version of &quot;Shada&quot; in 2017, with missing dialogue newly recorded by the original cast, using the same audio equipment employed in the initial shoot, and animated by the team that undertook the reconstruction of the 1966 serial &quot;The Power of the Daleks&quot;. This version was released on DVD and Blu-ray in 2017, and finally broadcast on television as a feature length TV moviewhich was titled &quot;The Lost Episode&quot; rather than &quot;Shada&quot;in 2018.

A new version with enhanced animation and split into six episodes was released on 20 December 2021, as part of a Season 17 Blu-ray boxset.

Previous attempts to present the story include a narrated reconstruction for BBC Video; a re-imagined audio play by Big Finish Productions, also offered with basic Flash imagery on BBCi and the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; website; and a novelisation by Gareth Roberts, based on the latest shooting scripts, with the author&#x27;s own additions.

==Synopsis==
The Fourth Doctor answers a distress signal from Professor Chronotis, a Time Lord posing as a professor at St Cedd&#x27;s College, Cambridge who lent a Gallifreyan tome to his student Chris Parsons. The Doctor retrieves the book while Chronotis dies after his mind is extracted by the sphere of a mad scientist named Skagra, living long enough to warn Romana, K9, and Parsons of them and Shada. The Doctor locates Skagra&#x27;s cloaked spacecraft, only for his companions to be captured while Skagra has his sphere extract the Doctor&#x27;s mind to decode the book before taking Romana in the TARDIS to his carrier ship and Krarg creations. But the Doctor survives his ordeal with his mind intact and has the ship&#x27;s computer release Chris and K9 and take them to a space station Skagra previously occupied. The group finds Skagra&#x27;s discarded colleagues and learn he is after a Time Lord named Salyavin.

Back on Earth, Clare Keightley accidentally revives Chronotis whose chambers are revealed as a TARDIS, the Professor explaining the book is a key to the prison planet Shada where Salyavin is held. Chronotis and Clare repair the TARDIS to reach Skagra&#x27;s carrier, saving the Doctor and Chris after Skagra decodes the book and reveals his intent to absorb Salyavin&#x27;s mind and use its telepathy to unite all life into a single Universal Mind.

The group reaches Shada as Skagra releases the prisoners, and Chronotis is revealed as Salyavin with Skagra extracting his mind and turning the prisoners and Chris into his thralls. Reminded that the Universal Mind contains a copy of his brain, the Doctor builds a telepathy helmet to wrest control from Skagra while the Krarg are destroyed. Skagra ends up a prisoner in his own ship while the Doctor returns the restored prisoners to Shada and parts ways with Chronotis, musing over Chronotis&#x27; exploits being exaggerated while expecting a similar treatment within two centuries.

==Production==
Originally, writer Douglas Adams presented a wholly different idea for the season&#x27;s six-part finale, involving the Doctor&#x27;s retirement from adventuring. Facing resistance from producer Graham Williams, Adams chose to avoid work on a replacement, under the expectation that time pressures would eventually force the producer&#x27;s hand and allow his idea to be used. Ultimately, however, Williams forced Adams to conceive a new story as a last-minute replacement, which became &quot;Shada&quot;.

Under the original remit, Williams intended the story as a discussion about the death penalty, specifically how a civilisation like the Time Lords would deal with the issue and treat its prisoners.

As composed by Adams, the story was scheduled to span six 25-minute episodes. Location filming in Cambridge and the first of three studio sessions at BBC Television Centre were completed as scheduled; however, when the scheduled second studio block was due to start, it fell foul of a long-running technicians&#x27; dispute at the BBC. The strike was over by the onset of rehearsals for the third recording session, but ultimately the studio time was redirected to other higher-priority Christmas programming, leaving the serial incomplete.

Following the departure of Williams from the role of producer, attempts were made by new producer John Nathan-Turner to remount the story; for various reasons, however, this never transpired. Consequently, in June 1980, the production was formally dropped. It is estimated that only 50% of the story was filmed.

After the production halt, Adams expressed a low opinion of the script and was content to let it remain obscure, turning down offers to adapt the story in various forms. He once claimed that when he had signed the contract allowing the script&#x27;s 1992 release (accompanying the serial&#x27;s VHS reconstruction), it had been amongst a pile of papers sent over by his agent, and that he was unaware of what he was agreeing to.

In 1983, footage from &quot;Shada&quot; was used in &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, the 20th Anniversary special. Tom Baker, the fourth actor to play the Doctor, had declined to appear in the special, and the plot was reworked to explain the events in the scenes.

===Cast notes===
Denis Carey was subsequently cast as the eponymous Keeper in Tom Baker&#x27;s penultimate story, &quot;The Keeper of Traken&quot; (1981), and also appeared as the Borad&#x27;s avatar in &quot;Timelash&quot; (1985).

==Reconstruction==

===1992 VHS reconstruction===
A decade after the serial&#x27;s abandonment, John Nathan-Turner set out to complete the story, in a fashion, by commissioning new effects shots and a score, and having Tom Baker record linking material to cover the missing scenes. The resulting shortened episodes (of between 14 and 22 minutes each) received a 111-minute VHS release in 1992. In its UK edition, the VHS was accompanied by a facsimile of a version of Douglas Adams&#x27;s script. The release was discontinued in the UK in 1996.

This VHS reconstruction, the 2003 BBCi/Big Finish adaptation, and the 1994 documentary &quot;More Than Thirty Years in the TARDIS&quot;, were re-released together on DVD on 7 January 2013 as &quot;The Legacy Collection&quot; (UK) or simply &quot;Shada&quot; (North America).

===2017 animated restoration===
On 24 November 2017, an effort to complete the serial officially, using newly recorded dialogue from the original cast (using the serial&#x27;s original recording engineer and audio equipment), and new animated footage to complete the missing segments, was released as a digital download; DVD and Blu-ray releases followed on 4 December that year, in Region 2. The new sequences were animated by the same team that undertook the 2016 animated edition of the 1966 serial &quot;The Power of the Daleks&quot;, including director Charles Norton, with lead character art by Martin Geraghty, character shading by Adrian Salmon, props by Mike Collins, and background art by Daryl Joyce.

A two-disc Region 1 DVD release was originally set to be made available on 9 January 2018; this was later postponed in the US and Canada to 4 September that year. The serial was released on 10 January 2018 in Region 4.

The final completed version received its US debut broadcast on 19 July 2018, on BBC America, with guide data giving the episode title as &quot;The Lost Episode&quot; rather than &quot;Shada&quot;.

===2021 animated restoration===
Season 17 of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was released on Blu-ray on 20 December 2021 as part of the Collection series, including a new version of Shada with enhanced animation. Whereas the 2017 version was only available in omnibus form, the new version was presented in the form of six separate episodes.

==Other adaptations ==
===Big Finish audio play and web animation (2003)===

In 2003, the BBC commissioned Big Finish Productions to remake &quot;Shada&quot; as an audio play which was then webcast in six episodic segments, accompanied by limited Flash animation, on the BBC website using illustrations provided by comic strip artist Lee Sullivan. The play stars Paul McGann as the Eighth Doctor and Lalla Ward as Romana. The audio play was also broadcast on digital radio station BBC7, on 10 December 2005 (as a 2½-hour omnibus), and was repeated in six parts as the opening story to the Eighth Doctor&#x27;s summer season, which began on 16 July 2006.

The webcast version (originally broadcast via BBCi&#x27;s &quot;Red Button&quot;) remains available from the BBC &quot;Doctor Who&quot; &quot;classic series&quot; website and an expanded audio-only version is available for purchase on CD from Big Finish. This expanded version was the one broadcast on BBC7.

====Production====
Tom Baker was originally approached to reprise the role of the Doctor, but declined. The Eighth Doctor was then substituted and the story reworked accordingly.

Portions of the Big Finish version were reworked by Gary Russell to make the story fit into &quot;Doctor Who&quot; continuity. This included a new introduction, and a new explanation for the Fourth Doctor and Romana being &quot;taken out of time&quot; during the events of &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;: the Eighth Doctor has come to collect Romana and K9 because he has begun to have a feeling that there was something they should have done at that time.

When Skagra is investigating the Doctor, clips from three other Big Finish productions can be heard, exclusively on the CD version – &quot;The Fires of Vulcan&quot;, &quot;The Marian Conspiracy&quot; and &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot;. The original serial was to have used clips from &quot;The Pirate Planet&quot; (1978), &quot;The Power of Kroll&quot; (1978–79), &quot;The Creature from the Pit&quot; (1979), &quot;The Androids of Tara&quot; (1978), &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot; (1979), and &quot;City of Death&quot; (1979).

====Outside references====
In Episode 2 of the webcast version, when Chris is in his lab showing Clare the book, a vending machine-like object in the background is labelled &quot;Nutrimat&quot;, a reference to a similar device in Adams&#x27; &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. Two other references are a sequence where Skagra steals a Ford Prefect and when images of &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; characters appear as inmates on Shada itself.

===Ian Levine animated version (2011)===
In 2010, Ian Levine funded an unofficial project to complete the original &quot;Shada&quot; story using animation and the original voice actors, minus Tom Baker and David Brierley, to complete the parts of the story that were never filmed. John Leeson replaced Brierley as the voice of K9, and Paul Jones (voice actor and commercial radio producer) replaced Tom Baker as the Doctor. The completed story was finished in late 2011 and announced by Levine, via his Twitter account, on 8 September 2011. J. R. Southall, writer for the science fiction magazine &quot;Starburst&quot;, reviewed the completed version at Levine&#x27;s invitation and scored it 10 out of 10 in an article published on 15 September 2011. The completed Levine version appeared on torrent sites over two years later, on 12 October 2013.

==In print==
===Novelisation and audio book (2012)===
Elements of the story were reused by Adams for his novel &quot;Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency&quot;, in particular the character of Professor Chronotis who possesses a time machine. Adams did not allow &quot;Shada&quot;, or any of his other &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories, to be novelised by Target Books. It is, therefore, one of only five serials from the 1963–1989 series not to be novelised by Target – along with Adams&#x27; other stories &quot;The Pirate Planet&quot; and &quot;City of Death&quot;, plus Eric Saward&#x27;s two Dalek stories (&quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot; and &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot;).

A six-part adaptation of the story by Jonathan V. Way appeared in issues 13–18 of &quot;Cosmic Masque&quot;, the Doctor Who Appreciation Society&#x27;s fiction magazine. Adams granted permission for the adaptation on condition that it was never published in collected form.

BBC Books published a novelisation of this serial on 15 March 2012, written by Gareth Roberts. Roberts drew on the latest versions of the scripts available, as well as adding new material of his own to &quot;fix&quot; what he viewed as various plotholes and unanswered questions. Nicholas Pegg, in his review of the book for &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, heartily praised it, calling it a &quot;successful duet&quot;.

====Audio book====
AudioGo released an unabridged audiobook of Roberts&#x27; novelization on 15 March 2012. Narrated by Lalla Ward, with John Leeson voicing K9, it runs 11 hours and 30 minutes. It was made available for download or on 10 CDs (CD , Download ). Vanessa Bishop reviewed it favourably for &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, singling out Simon E. Power&#x27;s sound design for special praise.

==Reviews==
Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial (at the time in the form of the 1992 VHS reconstruction) a mixed review in &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), saying; 

Patrick Mulkern reviewed the 2017 partially reconstructed version for &quot;Radio Times&quot;, and thought that despite &quot;pockets of magic to enjoy&quot;, it was a &quot;sprawling but far-from-epic serial&quot;. He felt that the humour was repetitive and fell flat, and that the action was pedestrian. Mulkern recommended the novelisation by Gareth Roberts as a superior alternative.

<doc id="88471" wikidata="Q5378358" url="?curid=88471" title="English Revolution">
<text>The English Revolution is a term that has been used to describe two separate events in English history. Prior to the 20th century, it was generally applied to the 1688 Glorious Revolution, when James II was deposed and a constitutional monarchy established under William III and Mary II.

However, Marxist historians began using it for the period covering the 1639–1653 Wars of the Three Kingdoms and the Interregnum that followed the Execution of Charles I in 1649, before the 1660 Stuart Restoration had returned Charles II to the throne. Writing in 1892, Friedrich Engels described this period as &quot;the Great Rebellion&quot; and the Glorious Revolution of 1688 as &quot;comparatively puny&quot;, although he claimed that both were part of the same revolutionary movement.

Although Charles II was retroactively declared to have been the legal and rightful monarch since the death of his father in 1649, which resulted in a return to the status quo in many areas, a number of gains made under the Commonwealth remained in law.

== Whig theory ==
Tensions regarding the English monarchy began well before the Revolution of 1688. When Charles I was executed in 1649 by the English Parliament, England entered into a republic, or Commonwealth, that lasted until Charles II was reestablished as king of England in 1660. The intermittent civil wars that lasted between 1649 and 1688 were a &quot;constitutional struggle originating from the unresolved contradictions fostered by the Reformation&quot;. Debates amongst England&#x27;s post-Reformation state and the constitutional basis for civil involvement in ecclesiastical and governmental issues continually converged together. During the Revolution of 1688, King James II was replaced by the monarchs William III and Mary II, and a constitutional monarchy was established that was described by Whig historians as the &quot;English Revolution&quot;. That interpretation suggests that the &quot;English Revolution&quot; was the final act in the long process of reform and consolidation by Parliament to achieve a balanced constitutional monarchy in Britain, with laws made that pointed towards freedom.

== Marxist theory ==
The Marxist view of the English Revolution suggests that the events of 1640 to 1660 in Britain were a bourgeois revolution in which the final section of English feudalism (the state) was destroyed by a bourgeois class (and its supporters) and replaced with a state (and society), which reflected the wider establishment of agrarian (and later industrial) capitalism. Such an analysis sees the English Revolution as pivotal in the transition from feudalism to capitalism and from a feudal state to a capitalist state in Britain.

The phrase &quot;English Revolution&quot; was first used by Marx in the short text &quot;England&#x27;s 17th Century Revolution&quot;, a response to a pamphlet on the Glorious Revolution of 1688 by François Guizot. Oliver Cromwell and the English Civil War are also referred to multiple times in the work &quot;The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte&quot;, but the event is not directly referred to by the name. By 1892, Engels was using the term &quot;The Great Rebellion&quot; for the conflict, and, while still recognising it as part of the same revolutionary event, dismissed the Glorious Revolution of 1688 as &quot;comparatively puny&quot;.

According to the Marxist historian Christopher Hill:

Later developments of the Marxist view moved on from the theory of bourgeois revolution to suggest that the English Revolution anticipated the French Revolution and later revolutions in the field of popular administrative and economic gains. Along with the expansion of parliamentary power, the English Revolution broke down many of the old power relations in both rural and urban English society. The guild democracy movement of the period won its greatest successes among London&#x27;s transport workers, most notably the Thames Watermen, who democratized their company in 1641–1643. With the outbreak of civil war in 1642, rural communities began to seize timber and other resources on the estates of royalists, Catholics, the royal family and the church hierarchy. Some communities improved their conditions of tenure on such estates.

The old status quo began a retrenchment after the end of the main civil war in 1646, and more especially after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, but some gains endured in the long term. The democratic element introduced in the watermen&#x27;s company in 1642, for example, survived, with vicissitudes, until 1827.
The Marxist view also developed a concept of a &quot;Revolution within the Revolution&quot; (pursued by Hill, Brian Manning and others), which placed a greater deal of emphasis on the radical movements of the period (such as the agitator Levellers, mutineers in the New Model Army and the Diggers), who attempted to go further than Parliament in the aftermath of the Civil War.

Brian Manning claimed:

=== Criticism ===
The idea, while popular among Marxist historians, has been criticised by many historians of more liberal schools, and of revisionist schools.

The notion that the events of 1640 to 1660 constitute an English Revolution has been criticized by historians such as Austin Woolrych, who pointed out that

Woolrych argues that the notion that the period constitutes an &quot;English Revolution&quot; not only ignores the lack of significant social change contained within the period but also ignores the long-term trends of the early modern period which extend beyond this narrow time frame. 

Neither Karl Marx nor Friedrich Engels ever ignored the further development of the bourgeois state beyond that point, however, as is clear from their writings on the Industrial Revolution.

== Other uses ==
The term &quot;English Revolution&quot; is also used by non-Marxists in the Victorian period to refer to 1642 such as the critic and writer Matthew Arnold in &quot;The Function of Criticism at the Present Time&quot;: &quot;This is what distinguishes it [the French Revolution] from the English Revolution of Charles the First&#x27;s time&quot;.

<text>City of Death is the second serial of the seventeenth season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which depicts the adventures of a time-travelling humanoid alien known as the Doctor. It was produced by the BBC and first broadcast in four weekly parts between 29 September 1979 and 20 October 1979 on BBC1. The serial was written by &quot;David Agnew&quot; – a pseudonym for the combined work of David Fisher, Douglas Adams, and Graham Williams – and directed by Michael Hayes.

&quot;City of Death&quot; features the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) and his companion Romana (Lalla Ward). Set primarily in present day Paris, the plot concerns a scheme by Count Scarlioni (Julian Glover), in reality an alien called Scaroth, to steal the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; to finance experiments in time travel in the hope of averting the accident that killed the remainder of his race four hundred million years previously, which began the existence of life on the planet as well.

The original storyline devised by Fisher was heavily retooled by script editor Adams, aided by producer Williams. It was the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial to film on location outside of the United Kingdom; the production team worked in Paris during April and May 1979; studio work was completed in June.

Broadcast during a strike that took ITV (the BBC&#x27;s rival) off the air, &quot;City of Death&quot; scored high ratings. The fourth episode was watched by over sixteen million viewers, the highest UK television audience ever attained by an episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Although retrospectively regarded as one of the best serials from the series&#x27; classic run, initial reception was mixed, with criticism of the humorous tone. In September 2009, it was ranked as readers&#x27; eighth favourite story (of 200-to-that-date) in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; issue 413.

==Plot==
In Paris, the Doctor and Romana sense a time distortion. They observe the Countess Scarlioni using an alien device to scan the security systems housing Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; at the Louvre. The pair meet Inspector Duggan, who suspects the Countess to be involved in an art theft scheme with her husband, Count Scarlioni. Duggan joins the Doctor and Romana in investigating the Scarlioni mansion. There, they discover Dr. Kerensky&#x27;s temporal experiments, the source of the distortions, and six exact copies of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;. The Doctor instructs Romana and Duggan to continue investigating while he returns to the TARDIS to visit Leonardo. The Count successfully steals the real painting and captures Romana and Duggan after the Doctor leaves. Learning that Romana is familiar with time, he kills Dr. Kerensky and forces Romana to continue the tests.

The Doctor arrives at Leonardo&#x27;s studio but is captured by another Scarlioni, who reveals he is really Scaroth, the last Jagaroth. His people arrived on Earth 400 million years ago, but the others died when their craft exploded, and his own body was fragmented across time. Collectively, Scaroth&#x27;s fragments manipulated humanity to invent technology that will let him go back in time to stop the explosion. To finance his work, he employed Leonardo to create copies of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; to sell off after stealing the original. After Scaroth leaves, the Doctor escapes and writes &quot;This is a fake&quot; on the blank canvases before returning to the present.

Scaroth threatens to destroy Paris if Romana stops helping him. The Doctor tries to gain the Countess&#x27; help by showing Scaroth&#x27;s true form, but Scaroth kills her. Romana completes the work and Scaroth uses it to travel to the past. The Doctor, Romana and Duggan follow him via the TARDIS, fearing that the ship&#x27;s explosion created life on Earth, and if Scaroth should prevent it, humanity would not exist. Duggan knocks Scaroth out in time, returning the latter to the present, where he is discovered, unmasked, by his bodyguard. The ensuing fight sets the mansion ablaze, destroying Scaroth and the paintings save one marked copy. Duggan argues that they&#x27;ve lost an invaluable piece of art, but the Doctor assures him that the copy, still done by Leonardo&#x27;s hand, will go unnoticed, and that art is worthless if its monetary value is all that matters before bidding him farewell.

==Production==

===Conception and writing===

Writer David Fisher had contributed two scripts to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;″s sixteenth season – &quot;The Stones of Blood&quot; and &quot;The Androids of Tara&quot; – and was asked by producer Graham Williams for further story ideas. Fisher submitted two proposals; the first of these became &quot;The Creature from the Pit&quot; while the other, &quot;The Gamble with Time&quot;, concerned a plot to rig the casinos in Las Vegas to finance time travel experiments. Williams asked Fisher to rework &quot;The Gamble With Time&quot; as a spoof of Bulldog Drummond, a fictional adventurer from the 1920s. Fisher&#x27;s draft script centered around Scarlioni, a member of the Sephiroth race, who had accidentally become fractured in time. The script was mainly set in the year 1928 with the Doctor and Romana, aided by Drummond-esque detective &quot;Pug&quot; Farquharson, on the trail of the stolen Mona Lisa, pursuing Scarlioni from Paris to Monte Carlo where his partner, the Baroness Heidi, is using time travel technology to cheat at roulette at the casino to fund Scarlioni&#x27;s time travel experiments. Other settings included Paris in 1979, Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s studio in the year 1508, and prehistoric Earth. At this point, production unit manager John Nathan-Turner had worked out that the production team could afford to film on location in Paris with a stripped-down crew. This necessitated a rewrite to Fisher&#x27;s scripts to move the action to Paris and, for cost reasons, to drop the 1920s setting. The Doctor&#x27;s robotic dog companion K9 also had to be removed from the script as the cost of bringing the robot dog and his operators to Paris was prohibitive.

However, Fisher was going through a divorce, and his personal situation meant that he was unable to perform the rewrites. This meant that script editor Douglas Adams, aided by Graham Williams, had to perform a complete rewrite of the story over the course of a weekend. According to Adams, Graham Williams &quot;took me back to his place, locked me in his study and hosed me down with whisky and black coffee for a few days, and there was the script&quot;. The revised script, now titled &quot;The Curse of the Sephiroth&quot;, was credited to &quot;David Agnew&quot;, a standard pseudonym used by the BBC and which had been previously used on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; for the season fifteen serial &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot;. The serial was subsequently retitled &quot;City of Death&quot; on 8 May 1979. Adams would later reuse elements of &quot;City of Death&quot;, along with the unfinished &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Shada&quot; (1979; 2003), in his novel &quot;Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency&quot; (1987).

In Part One, Lalla Ward as Romana makes a throwaway reference to a great art gallery called the Braxiatel Collection; the &quot;Virgin New Adventures&quot; novel series would later expand on this, introducing the character Irving Braxiatel, a Time Lord. Braxiatel also appears in the &quot;Bernice Summerfield&quot; series of novels and audio dramas and in the &quot;Gallifrey&quot; series of audio dramas which starred Ward as Romana.

===Casting===

Julian Glover was a well-established character actor who had previously appeared as Richard the Lionheart in &quot;The Crusade&quot; (1965). He was reluctant to don the Jagaroth mask as he felt the mask would impede his performance. As a result, he is doubled by Richard Sheekey in those scenes. Tom Chadbon was cast as Duggan on account of his resemblance to the Franco-Belgian comics hero Tintin. Peter Halliday had previously appeared in several &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials including &quot;The Invasion&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who and the Silurians&quot;.

Douglas Adams knew John Cleese and Eleanor Bron through his connections with &quot;Monty Python&quot; and the Footlights. On learning that both would be working in BBC Television Centre on the day the art gallery scenes were to be recorded, he persuaded them to make a cameo appearance in a short scene written for &quot;two Englishmen&quot;. Cleese and Bron agreed on the condition that there be no pre-publicity regarding their appearance; Cleese wanted them to be credited as &quot;Helen Swanetsky&quot; and &quot;Kim Bread&quot; but the BBC declined. Cleese liked the name &quot;Kim Bread&quot; and used it in later projects. During recording, Cleese and Baker also recorded two short comedy skits for the BBC Christmas tape.

===Filming===
&quot;City of Death&quot; director Michael Hayes had previously directed &quot;The Androids of Tara&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Armageddon Factor&quot; (1979). He also had experience filming in Paris, having worked there on adaptations of &quot;Maigret&quot; (1960–63) and other Georges Simenon stories for the BBC. Location filming took place in Paris between 30 April 1979 and 3 May 1979. It proved a difficult shoot as the dates coincided with the May Day holiday period, which meant that many of the locations chosen for filming were closed, necessitating considerable improvisation on the part of the cast and crew. Model filming was conducted at Bray Studios between 8 May 1979 and 10 May 1979. These concentrated on the shots of the Jagaroth spacecraft taking off from the prehistoric Earth and were overseen by Ian Scoones, a veteran of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. Following rehearsals, production moved to BBC Television Centre where the remaining scenes were recorded in two blocks; the first between 21 May 1979 and 22 May 1979 and second between 3 June 1979 and 5 June 1979.

Tom Baker found filming in Paris to be very different from what he was used to in the UK where crowds would gather to watch the filming and meet the stars. &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was not shown in France at the time and so the cast and crew were largely ignored. Lalla Ward found &quot;City of Death&quot; the most challenging &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial she worked on but was pleased with the outcome, saying, &quot;We had to film loads of scenes in the rain and cold... there was no glamour in it at all... it was different from the ordinary stories too and I like the finished result&quot;. Seeing her costumes as an important part in creating the role of Romana, Ward clashed with costume designer Doreen James, rejecting the silver catsuit James had designed for her for the story. Ward came up with the idea for the schoolgirl costume she wore in conjunction with Baker, recalling, &quot;I thought it would be fun to wear something that little girls probably hated wearing because it might cheer them up... I didn&#x27;t bank on the fact that I&#x27;d also get loads of letters from their fathers saying &#x27;Cor! School uniform!&#x27;&quot;.

==Broadcast and reception==

&quot;City of Death&quot; was broadcast on BBC1 over four consecutive Saturdays beginning on 29 September 1979. At this time, industrial action had blacked out rival broadcaster ITV and as a result, the serial scored very high ratings, averaging 14.5 million viewers over the four episodes; 16.1 million watched the fourth episode, the largest audience ever recorded for an episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The story was repeated on BBC1 across four consecutive evenings from Tuesday to Friday, 12 – 15 August 1980, achieving viewing figures of 6.3, 5.5, 5.6 and 5.9 million viewers respectively.

Audience appreciation ratings for the first two parts of &quot;City of Death were&quot; a respectable score of 64%. &quot;Radio Times&quot; published two letters from viewers regarding &quot;City of Death&quot;. Les Rogers of Hastings praised the serial&#x27;s cast and the location filming; less impressed, however, was Paul R. Maskew of Exeter who felt the show was being played for laughs. Responding to similar criticisms from viewers, Douglas Adams wrote, &quot;If the programme didn&#x27;t move and take a few risks then it would have died of boredom years ago&quot;. Several viewers wrote to point out the discrepancy between the start of life on Earth of 4,000 million years ago and the date given in &quot;City of Death&quot; of 400 million years ago. Graham Williams replied, &quot;The good Doctor makes the odd mistake or two but I think an error of 3,600 million years is pushing it! His next edition of the &quot;Encyclopedia Galactica&quot; will provide an erratum&quot;. Another viewer wrote that the atmosphere of the primordial Earth would have been poisonous to the Doctor and his companions; Douglas Adams responded to this criticism, citing artistic licence.

&quot;City of Death&quot; was voted seventh in a 1998 poll of the readers of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; to find the best &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story; the magazine commented that it &quot;represented the height of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as popular light entertainment for all the family&quot;. In 2009, &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; readers voted it in eighth place. In a more recent 2014 poll, the magazine&#x27;s readers voted it fifth best Doctor Who story of all time. A 2008 article in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named &quot;City of Death&quot; one of the ten greatest episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. John Condor, writing in the fanzine &quot;DWB&quot; in 1991, hailed the story as &quot;the best blend of kitsch, surrealism, fantasy, and comedy-drama seen in our favourite Time Lord&#x27;s annals&quot;. Vanessa Bishop, reviewing the serial&#x27;s DVD release, described it as &quot;imaginatively written, well-performed and beautifully made, &quot;City of Death&quot; is a story where pretty much everything works&quot;. Reacting to the serial, as part of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;″s ongoing &quot;Time Team&quot; feature, Jacqueline Rayner said &quot;you&#x27;re suddenly, almost violently, made aware this is happening in our world... with people just getting on with their business and two Time Lords walking through it. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever experienced that with &quot;Doctor Who&quot; up till now... it&#x27;s the tiny touches of mundanity amid the fantastical that lift the story even higher&quot;. Charlie Jane Anders and Javier Grillo-Marxuach of io9 included it on their list of &quot;10 TV Episodes that Changed Television&quot;, citing &quot;the sharp dialogue and clever use of time travel [that] prefigure everything Steven Moffat has done with the series in recent years.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; reviewer Christopher Bahn described &quot;City of Death&quot; as the &quot;gem&quot; of the seventeenth season, finding Adams&#x27; subtle comedy script &quot;easily the funniest and most quotable the series ever achieved&quot;. While he praised Scarlioni&#x27;s costume and the mask, he felt that more could have been done with using Paris as a filming location.

However, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fandom&#x27;s initial response was not so positive; John Peel, writing in the fanzine &quot;TARDIS&quot; in 1979, decried it as &quot;total farce... I simply couldn&#x27;t believe this was &quot;Doctor Who&quot;... the continual buffoonery is getting on my nerves&quot;. A similar view was held by Gary Russell who, reviewing the VHS release in 1991, said, &quot;&quot;City of Death&quot;, like most Douglas Adams material, is overrated and misses the mark for me, falling between the stools of good pastiche and bad parody and making fairly unsatisfactory viewing&quot;. Vanessa Bishop countered that it was &quot;the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story it&#x27;s alright to laugh at... we must now accept that &quot;City of Death&quot; is funny — because if we didn&#x27;t the &quot;Crackerjack&quot;-style sleuths, scientists and all... would leave it knocking about near the bottom of all the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story ranking polls&quot; and, responding to the criticisms about the levels of comedy, that &quot;it&#x27;s precisely these things that make it seem so special&quot;. Reviewing the serial in 2011, Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; awarded it three stars out of five, stating he disliked the smug tone to the humour and Ward&#x27;s &quot;snooty&quot; portrayal of Romana. Despite this, he noted that the serial had good production values and direction, as well as a few jokes that he enjoyed.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

&quot;City of Death&quot; is one of five &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials from the series&#x27; original run (1963–1989) not to have been novelised by Target Books; the others are &quot;The Pirate Planet&quot;, &quot;Shada&quot;, &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot;, and &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot;. Target approached Douglas Adams to write a novelisation, offering their standard advance of £600; Adams replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be embarrassing but I do have a tendency to be a best-selling author&quot;. Target, concerned that their regular authors would seek better terms, refused to increase their offer. Several years later, Target editor Nigel Robinson offered an advance of £4,000 – double what was the standard advance at the time – but Adams again declined. Adams was unwilling to allow another author to write the novelisation. However, after Adams&#x27; death his estate allowed Gareth Roberts to write an adaptation of the unfinished serial &quot;Shada&quot;, which was published by BBC Books in 2012. In 2013, Roberts announced that he was working on a novelisation of &quot;City of Death&quot;, to be published on 21 May 2015. Roberts later announced that James Goss was working on the book instead. An abridged version was published as part of the &quot;Target Collection&quot; 5 April 2018.

===Home media===
&quot;City of Death&quot; was released on VHS in April 1991 with a cover by Andrew Skilleter. It was re-issued in 2001. A DVD was released in 2005 with special features including commentary by actors Julian Glover and Tom Chadbon, as well as director Michael Hayes, and the behind-the-scenes documentary &quot;Paris in the Springtime&quot;. It was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 37 on 2 June 2010. On 1 January 2013, AudioGO released a two-hour soundtrack of the serial, narrated by Lalla Ward. A vinyl release of the soundtrack was released in 2018 exclusively for Record Store Day. Ian Scoones&#x27; storyboards for &quot;City of Death&quot; special effects sequences were published in Peter Haining&#x27;s book &quot;Doctor Who – 25 Glorious Years&quot; in 1988, and a Scaroth figure was released by Harlequin Miniatures in 1999.

<text>Cannery Row is a waterfront street in the New Monterey neighborhood of Monterey, California, known for formerly being home to a number of now-defunct sardine canneries. The last of these closed in 1973. The street, formerly Ocean View Avenue, was officially renamed in January 1958 to honor John Steinbeck and his novel &quot;Cannery Row&quot;, though the nickname had existed before the book was published. In the novel&#x27;s opening sentence, Steinbeck described the street as &quot;a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream.&quot; The street borders the adjacent city of Pacific Grove.

==History==
The first sardine cannery opened on Valentine&#x27;s Day, 1908. Others joined it, and profited during the two World Wars, but a sardine shortage led to their failure. Entrepreneurs subsequently resurrected Cannery Row as a tourist attraction.

Cannery Row was the setting of John Steinbeck&#x27;s novels &quot;Cannery Row&quot; (1945) and &quot;Sweet Thursday&quot; (1954). Both were the basis for the 1982 movie &quot;Cannery Row&quot;, starring Nick Nolte and Debra Winger. It is also mentioned in Bob Dylan&#x27;s song &quot;Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands&quot;.

Pacific Biological Laboratories, a biological supply house, was located at 800 Ocean View Avenue (now 800 Cannery Row) from 1928 to 1948, and operated by Edward F. Ricketts, who was the inspiration for several characters in Steinbeck novels. The laboratory is still preserved. Across from the laboratory still exists a Chinese-American-owned store mentioned in both &quot;Cannery Row&quot; and &quot;Sweet Thursday&quot;, as well as a vacant lot that was the &quot;home&quot; of some of the homeless characters in the novel. The former reflects Chinese American history in the area, starting with Chinese immigrants who entered the fishing industry, exporting seafood and abalone shells to China, Europe, and other parts of the U.S. At 851 Cannery Row, across from Pacific Biological Laboratories, is the original building that inspired the bar from the novel named La Ida Cafe.

Cannery Row was adjoined by a grand mansion owned by Montana mining tycoon James Andrew Murray. Known as &quot;Casa de las Olas&quot; or the Murray Hacienda, the mansion was demolished in the 1940s to make way for the expansion of more canneries. A historical marker is located on the site. The canneries failed after the collapse of the fishing industry in Monterey Bay in the mid-1950s, which resulted from a combination of factors, including unfavorable oceanic conditions, overfishing, and competition from other species. In his investigation of where the sardines had gone, Ed Ricketts finally concluded &quot;They&#x27;re in cans.&quot; Before the collapse, the fishery was one of the most productive in the world due to the upwelling of cold yet nutrient-rich water along the California coastline.

==Today==
Today the area offshore from Cannery Row is the Edward F. Ricketts State Marine Conservation Area (part of the larger Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary) and is home to a large resurgent population of California sea lions.

Cannery Row itself is now a tourist attraction with many restaurants and hotels, several of which are located in former cannery buildings, and a few historic attractions. Some privately owned fishing companies still exist on Cannery Row, housed on piers located a short distance from the historic district frequented by tourists.

In recent years, Cannery Row has become increasingly popular among sport fishermen due to extensive public fishing facilities. MacAbee Beach and San Carlos Beach, which bookend Cannery Row are both popular spots for kayak-launching; San Carlos Beach is one of Monterey Bay&#x27;s most popular scuba-diving spots.
The Monterey Bay Aquarium (opened in 1984) is located at the north end of Cannery Row, at the former site of the major Hovden Cannery. Norwegian immigrant Knut Hovden founded Hovden Food Products Corporation which opened on July 7, 1916. By canning squid at the end of its life, Hovden Cannery managed to outlast its neighbors, finally closing its doors in 1973 when it became the last cannery on the row to close.

In 2023, Cannery Row opened a pirate-themed ride called &quot;Treasure Hunt: The Ride&quot;.

<text>Monterey Bay Aquarium is a nonprofit public aquarium in Monterey, California. Known for its regional focus on the marine habitats of Monterey Bay, it was the first to exhibit a living kelp forest when it opened in October 1984. Its biologists have pioneered the animal husbandry of jellyfish and it was the first to successfully care for and display a great white shark. The organization&#x27;s research and conservation efforts also focus on sea otters, various birds, and tunas. Seafood Watch, a sustainable seafood advisory list published by the aquarium beginning in 1999, has influenced the discussion surrounding sustainable seafood. The aquarium was home to Otter 841 prior to her release into the wild as well as Rosa, the oldest living sea otter at the time of her death.

Early proposals to build a public aquarium in Monterey County were not successful until a group of four marine biologists affiliated with Stanford University revisited the concept in the late 1970s. Monterey Bay Aquarium was built at the site of a defunct sardine cannery and has been recognized for its architectural achievements by the American Institute of Architects. Along with its architecture, the aquarium has won numerous awards for its exhibition of marine life, ocean conservation efforts, and educational programs.

Monterey Bay Aquarium receives around two million visitors each year. It led to the revitalization of Cannery Row, and produces hundreds of millions of dollars for the economy of Monterey County. In addition to being featured in two PBS &quot;Nature&quot; documentaries, the aquarium has appeared in film and television productions.

== Founding and design ==
In the early 1960s, scientists at Stanford University&#x27;s Hopkins Marine Station grew wary of the growing industry on Cannery Row. The station succeeded in convincing the university of their concerns in 1967, and Stanford University purchased the property on Cannery Row that housed the Hovden Cannery, a sardine cannery on the border of Monterey and Pacific Grove. Hovden Cannery closed in 1973 when its parent company moved the plant, and Hopkins used the facility as a warehouse. In the late 1970s, however, Chuck Baxter and Robin Burnett—both faculty members at Hopkins—along with Nancy Burnett, a graduate of Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, and Steve Webster, faculty at San Jose State University, thought of building an aquarium on the Hovden Cannery site. Three separate proposals for an aquarium in Monterey County had already occurred in 1914, 1925, and 1944, but financial backing and public support for the idea was not sufficient. Nancy Burnett brought the group&#x27;s interest to her parents, Lucile and David Packard (cofounder of Hewlett-Packard), and their foundation commissioned a feasibility study. An aquarium was predicted to attract 300,000 paying visitors annually with a potential future increase to 500,000 so, in April 1978, the Packards created the Monterey Bay Aquarium Foundation, which purchased the Hovden property from Stanford for nearly US$1 million. Around this time, Julie Packard—also a daughter of David and Lucile—joined the planning group. David Packard funded construction with an initial donation of $7 million with the caveat that the private nonprofit would be financially self-supporting after it opened. Due to an expansion of its planned exhibits—after visits to public aquariums in Japan—and the design and creation of exhibits inhouse, the Packards paid a final sum of $55 million.

General contracting firm Rudolph and Sletten predicted the building would take 31 months (two and a half years) to construct, but project manager Linda Rhodes and architectural firm Esherick, Homsey, Dodge, and Davis (EHDD) first had to design the facility to fit Cannery Row. Those involved intended to reconstruct Hovden Cannery rather than destroy it, and EHDD acknowledged that the latter would be &quot;a big disservice to our visiting public and to the community&quot;. Concrete sections of the building were able to be kept, but other areas were repurposed; the cannery&#x27;s old warehouse was converted into administrative offices, and a seawater system for the aquatic exhibits replaced the cannery&#x27;s pump house that brought fish to the warehouse from floating storage tanks in the bay. The facility was constructed around the cannery&#x27;s boiler house, which is preserved as a non-functioning public exhibit. As the building would reside partially over water, unique challenges occurred throughout construction. Nearly half of the aquarium would be located over the bay in depths of up to , requiring foundational elements to be installed during low tide, which often occurred at night. According to a project manager with Rudolph and Sletten, excavations were sometimes lost as the composition of the ground underneath beach sand was inconsistent.

Various elements of the building mirrored that of Hovden Cannery, including its windows (to let in sunlight), plain cement walls, structural protection from waves and storms, and its many roofs. Exposed pipes and ducts along the ceiling also contributed to the industrial style of buildings on Cannery Row. The ironic transition from a plant that processed fish to an aquarium which would display them did not prevent the facility from appearing like a cannery, according to multiple journalists. The aquarium&#x27;s successful representation of the cannery was acknowledged by the California Historical Society with a historical preservation award.

When Monterey Bay Aquarium opened on October 20, 1984, it was the largest public aquarium in the United States. On opening day, 11,000 visited it and around 30,000 people attended the day&#x27;s festivities. In reference to the disappearance of sardines (through overfishing), which caused the canneries to close, the aquarium said that &quot;the fish are back!&quot; Throughout the following year, 2.4 million people visited, which influenced assumptions about &quot;the ability of marine life to entertain, educate, and promote a city.&quot; Within five years, it was reported in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that it was among California&#x27;s most popular visitor attractions. By 1994, it was the most attended aquarium in the United States. For its design, EHDD was awarded a National Honor Award from the American Institute of Architects in 1988. The institute&#x27;s state chapter in California gave the facility its Twenty-five Year Award in 2011 and, in 2016, it was awarded the national Twenty-five Year Award, described as &quot;a benchmark and role model for aquariums everywhere.&quot;

In discussing the aquarium&#x27;s conservation and education programs, its track record for entertaining visitors, and its reputation for collaboration, the head of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums described it as &quot;a definite leader&quot; in 2009 to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Since it opened in 1984, Julie Packard has been the aquarium&#x27;s executive director.

== Aquarium exhibits ==
According to a progress report during the aquarium&#x27;s planning phase in 1980, the founders&#x27; efforts to build an aquarium developed from an interest in sharing marine life of the region with the public. This would be accomplished through its exhibits, featuring the aquatic habitats of Monterey Bay and central California. The idea to display marine habitats was inspired by the work of ecologist Ed Ricketts in his 1939 book on intertidal ecology, &quot;Between Pacific Tides&quot;. In the early 1980s this was a unique approach to the design of public aquariums, as the two largest public aquariums at the time in the United States—Boston&#x27;s New England Aquarium (1969) and Baltimore&#x27;s National Aquarium (1981)—focused on &quot;magnificent coral reef exhibits or big sharks&quot;, and displayed few local species.

=== Seawater system ===
Monterey Bay Aquarium displays 35,000 animals belonging to over 550 species in of water. Filtered seawater from Monterey Bay is pumped into the Kelp Forest and other exhibits at per minute. At night, unfiltered seawater (or &quot;raw seawater&quot;) is used for the Kelp Forest exhibit to maintain its realistic appearance. The use of unfiltered seawater allows animals to grow in the aquarium&#x27;s plumbing so it must occasionally be cleaned with tools called pigs, which blast through the pipes under pressure to remove organisms and debris. Control systems that maintain this seawater system and other life support components for the animals are mostly automated, tracking various chemical parameters and reducing the likelihood for human error during repetitive tasks such as filter media backwashing. The seawater system is controlled by more than 10,000 data points.

=== Kelp Forest exhibit ===
At tall and long, the Kelp Forest exhibit is the focal point of Monterey Bay Aquarium&#x27;s Ocean&#x27;s Edge wing. Nearly three stories high, the exhibit is regarded as the first successful attempt to maintain a living kelp forest in an artificial setting. During the facility&#x27;s planning and construction, professionals doubted that kelp could be grown in an aquarium at this scale. And, even if it could be grown, critics of the project did not think the public would be interested in seeing this representation of Monterey Bay. During the design phase, kelp scientists Wheeler North at the California Institute of Technology and Mike Neushal at the University of California, Santa Barbara informed the aquarium of the kelp&#x27;s needs. The exhibit&#x27;s success at sustaining giant kelp and its realistic appearance are attributed to the availability of direct sunlight, the use of natural seawater from Monterey Bay, and a surge machine (a large plunger) that replicates California&#x27;s pulsing water currents. The surge machine, which plunges every 6 seconds, allows the kelp in the exhibit to grow an average of per day and was designed and constructed by David Packard. Kelp forests are important ecosystems along California&#x27;s coast—comparable to tropical rainforests in their biodiversity—and, alongside giant kelp, the exhibit contains species of fish indigenous to Monterey Bay, including rockfishes and leopard sharks.

=== Open Sea wing ===
In 1996, Monterey Bay Aquarium opened a second wing of aquatic exhibits, focusing on the pelagic habitats found offshore in Monterey Bay. Costing US$57 million and taking seven years to develop, the wing almost doubled the aquarium&#x27;s public exhibit space. It consists of three separate galleries: various jellyfish and other plankton found in the bay; a pelagic, large community exhibit; and &quot;ocean travelers&quot;, which features tufted puffins and sea turtles. When the exhibition opened, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported the aquarium had the most jellyfish on exhibit in the world. In 1997, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums awarded the wing its Exhibit Award.

Holding , the Open Sea community exhibit is the aquarium&#x27;s largest tank. Made of fiberglass-reinforced plastic, it is long and deep. Its largest viewing window—at long and tall—was reportedly the largest aquarium window in the world when it was installed in 1996. To discourage animals from swimming into the window in the absence of visitors and injuring or killing themselves (as a Pacific bluefin tuna did in 2007), an air hose underneath the window generates a &quot;bubble wall&quot; in front of it throughout the night. In 2011, species reported to be in the exhibit included green sea turtles, sardines, pelagic stingrays, scalloped hammerhead sharks, sandbar sharks, mahi-mahi, mackerel, bluefin and yellowfin tunas, and ocean sunfishes. Historically, the exhibit also included blue sharks, soupfin sharks, and California barracuda. Six great white sharks were displayed in the Open Sea exhibit between 2004 and 2011, an effort contested by some but generally described as having a positive scientific and educational impact. Prior to the display of the first white shark for six months before its release, the longest length of time that a white shark had survived in an aquarium was 16 days.

A 10-month, US$19 million renovation of the wing concluded in July 2011 to refurbish the community exhibit. Turbulent swimming patterns of tunas were dismantling the exhibit&#x27;s structural glass tiles, which the sea turtles were subsequently eating, so the exhibit was drained after all 10,000 animals were caught. Supplemental exhibits were added as part of this renovation featuring artwork that highlights current issues in ocean conservation, including overfishing and marine plastic pollution.

=== Other permanent exhibits ===
Monterey Bay Aquarium opened in 1984 with 83 tanks in 12 galleries, which more than doubled by 2014 into 200 live animal exhibits. In addition to the large Kelp Forest and Open Sea exhibits, the Monterey Bay Habitats tank is long, the shape of a figure eight, and holds over , a similar volume of seawater to the Kelp Forest. As its name suggests, it represents various habitats in Monterey Bay, from wharfs to the sandy seafloor to deep rocky reefs. Many aquariums in this exhibit contain man-made structures that were left in the bay to accumulate living organisms prior to the aquarium&#x27;s opening; in Monterey Bay Habitats, real pilings were obtained from the city&#x27;s harbor department for the exhibit&#x27;s wharf section. In others, artificial rocks tricked visitors and fish alike. With the aquarium&#x27;s debut, this &quot;nature-faking&quot; via human manipulation did not trick some, but the fakeness&#x27; did not necessarily detract from the aquarium&#x27;s intrinsic value.&quot;

Rescued sea otters live in a habitat holding , and are the only marine mammals exhibited. In 2014, the aquarium stated to the &quot;Vancouver Courier&quot; that it takes no official position on the controversy of captive killer whales or other cetaceans. The facility was not constructed to house cetaceans, and instead utilizes the 27 species of marine mammals that live in or travel through Monterey Bay as one of its &quot;exhibits&quot;, as guests can view the bay and marine mammals from decks along the back of the building.

Monterey Bay Aquarium was the first public aquarium to have its interior mapped on Google Street View, creating a virtual walking tour.

=== Temporary exhibitions ===
Monterey Bay Aquarium began creating temporary exhibitions (or &quot;special exhibitions&quot;) in the 1980s to display animals that are found outside of Monterey Bay. The first of these, titled &quot;Mexico&#x27;s Secret Sea&quot;, focused on the Sea of Cortez in 1989. Most exhibitions since then have focused on animal groups, including deep-sea animals (1999), sharks (2004), otters (2007), seahorses (2009), cephalopods (2014), and jellyfish. The 1997 &quot;Fishing for Solutions&quot; exhibition led to the development of the sustainable seafood program, Seafood Watch. In 2010, an exhibition titled &quot;Hot Pink Flamingos&quot; was one of the first aquarium exhibitions in the United States to explicitly discuss the effects of global warming on habitats and animals. Its content was successfully accessible and compelling to the public, but the exhibition was criticized for its narrow &quot;consumerist approach&quot; to climate change communication—promoting individual, marketplace-based actions rather than collective political ones.

At least three exhibitions have been devoted entirely to displaying jellyfish. In 1989, the aquarium&#x27;s second temporary exhibition, titled &quot;Living Treasures of the Pacific&quot;, included three jellyfish tanks following the successful display of one tank of moon jellies four years earlier in 1985. In 1992, the first temporary exhibition for jellyfish opened, called &quot;Planet of the Jellies&quot;, the success of which prompted a permanent jellyfish gallery within the Open Sea wing in 1996. Within 20 years of opening Planet of the Jellies, the aquarium created two more temporary exhibitions centered on jellyfish. The final one of the three exhibitions opened in 2012, and displayed around 16 species of jellyfish from around the world in &quot;a psychedelic theme from the 1960s&quot;. Staff members attribute the organization&#x27;s fascination with jellyfish to their visual appeal, primitive biology, and reputed calming effect on visitors.

Terrestrial animals were displayed for the first time—including a tarantula, a snake, and a scorpion—in a US$3.8 million exhibit on ecosystems of Baja California that opened in 2016. In April 2022, a US$15 million, exhibit focusing on deep sea animals opened after more than five years of development. The process relied extensively on technology used by Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute to collect animals nearly deep, and required the aquarium to build special tanks that provided freezing temperatures, high acidity, and low oxygen for animals. To lower the oxygen, applied water science staff manipulated a technique used in brewing. Some animals displayed included glowing jellies, giant isopods, brisingid sea stars, and sea angels.

== Research and conservation ==
Monterey Bay Aquarium helped create momentum for the establishment of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary in 1992, one of the largest marine protected areas in the United States. In 2004, the aquarium created a formal division to become involved in United States ocean policy and law, working with the Pew Charitable Trusts and the United States Commission on Ocean Policy at the onset. Staff scientists have authored scientific publications involving sea otters, great white sharks, and bluefin tunas, which are important species in the northern Pacific Ocean. In addition to other animals, work has been published in the areas of veterinary medicine, visitor studies, and museum exhibition development. Among over 200 institutions accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, Monterey Bay Aquarium ranked 10th in scientific publication activity between 1993 and 2013.

For Monterey Bay Aquarium&#x27;s captive animal propagation efforts, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums has granted two awards, including one for the aquarium&#x27;s work with purple-striped jellies in 1992. It has also received the association&#x27;s general conservation award for its Sea Otter Research and Conservation Program. In October 2017, the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums conferred its Conservation Award to the aquarium for its &quot;commitment to ocean protection and public awareness&quot;.

=== Marine life ===
Monterey Bay Aquarium&#x27;s Sea Otter Research and Conservation program began in 1984 to research and rehabilitate wild southern sea otters. more than 800 individuals had completed the rehabilitation program and researchers have collected data on wild sea otter populations using electronic tags. An otter rescued in 2001 began the program&#x27;s surrogacy efforts, in which adult female sea otters that have been rehabilitated but cannot be released act as surrogate mothers to stranded sea otter pups. The aquarium was the only sea otter rehabilitation site in California until The Marine Mammal Center began expanding a program for sea otters in 2017. Its work with sea otters is featured in the PBS &quot;Nature&quot; episode titled &quot;Saving Otter 501&quot;, which aired in October 2013.

Shorebirds, such as the threatened western snowy plover, are also rehabilitated and released. Since around 1998, the aquarium has worked with Point Blue Conservation Science to rescue western snowy plover eggs. The eggs hatch after being artificially incubated, and are raised until they are independent enough for release. The two organizations released 180 individuals in 2012, and about 100 individuals in 2013. The aquarium&#x27;s endangered African penguins are part of an Association of Zoos and Aquariums species survival plan, a program that identifies genetically important birds and allows specific breeding activity to occur. Five chicks have hatched in the penguin colony as of 2014 and some of those have been sent to other accredited institutions. Beginning in June 2007, the aquarium operates a public presentation with its rehabilitated Laysan albatross that has a wingspan of . The program&#x27;s goal is to inform visitors of the dangers that ocean plastic pollution causes for animals, especially the 21 species of albatrosses.

Pacific bluefin and yellowfin tunas have been historically displayed in the Open Sea community exhibit, some reaching more than . In 2011, three dozen fishes of the two species were on exhibit. Prior to opening the Open Sea wing in 1996, the aquarium established the Tuna Research and Conservation Center in 1994 in partnership with Stanford University&#x27;s Hopkins Marine Station. Staff scientists and Barbara Block—professor of marine sciences at Stanford University—have tagged wild Pacific bluefin tunas to study predator-prey relationships, and have also investigated tuna endothermy with captive tunas at the center. To improve international collaboration of bluefin tuna management, Monterey Bay Aquarium and Stanford University hosted a symposium in January 2016 in Monterey. Over 200 scientists, fisheries managers, and policy makers gathered to discuss solutions to the decline of Pacific bluefin tuna populations.

Aquarists also propagate animals behind-the-scenes for the public exhibits. Since 1985, the aquarium has been deeply involved in jellyfish propagation, creating three temporary exhibitions and one permanent gallery (within the Open Sea wing). The organization&#x27;s jellyfish collections have been the largest in the world, and its pioneering work with the animals resulted in a trend of jellyfish exhibitions in the United States. In August 2016, aquarists cultured comb jellies for the first time in a laboratory, which may allow them to become a model organism. Beginning in 2012, the aquarium began to breed many species of cephalopods in preparation for a temporary exhibition that opened in 2014. For the duration of the exhibition, half of the animals were cultured because of their short life cycles. A display in the exhibition showcased how aquarists rear different species of cephalopods, including bigfin reef squid, which live for only about six months. In partnership with Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, at least two deep-sea cephalopod species were displayed in the exhibition, including flapjack octopuses and the vampire squid.

==== Great white sharks ====
In 1984, Monterey Bay Aquarium&#x27;s first attempt to display a great white shark lasted 11 days, ending when the shark died because it did not eat. Through a later program named Project White Shark, six white sharks were exhibited between 2004 and 2011 in the Open Sea community exhibit, which was constructed in the 1990s. Researchers at universities in California attributed the aquarium&#x27;s success at exhibiting white sharks to the use of a net pen, which gave the sharks time to recover from capture prior to transport. A portable tank used to transport the fish to the exhibit allowed the sharks to swim continuously, which they must do in order to respire. These endeavors led to the first instance of a white shark eating in an aquarium.

At least one organization—the Pelagic Shark Research Foundation based in Santa Cruz, California—criticized the aquarium for attempting to keep white sharks in captivity, questioning the significance of possible scientific research and the ability to educate visitors. However, several independent biologists expressed approval for Project White Shark because of its logistical design, educational impact, and scientific insights. Regarding its educational impact, a white shark researcher from Australia stated in 2006 that &quot;the fact people can come and see these animals and learn from them is of immeasurable value.&quot; The first captive white shark—on exhibit in 2004 for more than six months—was seen by one million visitors, and another million visitors saw either the second or third white sharks on display. In 198 days, the first white shark grew more than and gained over prior to its release. Monterey Bay Aquarium is the only public aquarium in the world to have successfully exhibited a white shark for longer than 16 days.

The effort to display captive white sharks ended in 2011 due to the project&#x27;s high resource intensity. Captive white sharks also incurred injuries and killed other animals in the exhibit after becoming increasingly aggressive, and the final shark died due to unknown reasons immediately following its release. Although no longer on exhibit for the public, aquarium researchers have continued to conduct research on white sharks. Collaborating with Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in June 2016, staff scientists created cameras attached to harmless dorsal fin tags in an attempt to study the behavior of white sharks during their gathering known as the White Shark Café.

=== Seafood program ===
Monterey Bay Aquarium&#x27;s consumer-based Seafood Watch program encourages sustainable seafood purchasing from fisheries that are &quot;well managed and caught or farmed in ways that cause little harm to habitats or other wildlife.&quot; It began in 1999 as a result of a popular component of a temporary exhibition and has grown to consist of a website, six regional pocket guides, and mobile apps that allow consumers to check the sustainability ratings of specific fisheries. The program has expanded to include business collaborations, local and national restaurant and grocer partnerships, and outreach partnerships—primarily other public aquariums and zoos. Large-scale business and grocer affiliations include Aramark, Compass Group, Target, and Whole Foods Market. In both 2009 and 2015, Seafood Watch was reportedly playing an influential role in the discussion regarding seafood sustainability. According to the aquarium, the program&#x27;s efficacy is driven by its work with both businesses and consumers, and is supported by the organization&#x27;s expanding science and ocean policy programs.

In the late 2000s, Seafood Watch was likely the most known and most widely distributed sustainable seafood guide out of around 200 internationally. By 2014, fifteen years after its inception, the program had produced more than 52 million printed pocket guides. Its mobile apps were downloaded over one million times between 2009 and 2015. In 2003, the program&#x27;s website was granted a MUSE Award from the American Alliance of Museums for use of media and technology in science. &quot;Bon Appétit&quot; magazine awarded its Tastemaker of the Year award to Seafood Watch in 2008 and, in 2013, &quot;Sunset&quot; magazine described it as one of &quot;the most effective consumer-awareness programs&quot;.

In September 2016, the United States Agency for International Development announced it was cooperating with the aquarium to improve fisheries management in the Asia-Pacific.

=== Political advocacy ===
Monterey Bay Aquarium plays an active role in federal and state politics, from sponsoring governmental legislation about the ocean to persuading voter action from its visitors and online followers. The aquarium was a leading sponsor for the statewide shark fin ban in 2011. After the ban&#x27;s success its efforts shifted to focus on marine plastic pollution, supporting successful legislation which restricted the use of microbeads in personal care products. In support of California Proposition 67 (2016), the organization produced advertisements, web pages, and podcasts in favor of a statewide ban on single-use plastic grocery bags. The aquarium is a founding member of a partnership between 20 public aquariums for collaborating on policy-based conservation efforts. This partnership, called the Aquarium Conservation Partnership, hosted a plastic pollution conference at Monterey Bay Aquarium in December 2016. In July 2017, the aquarium and other members of the partnership began eliminating their own plastic products, such as plastic bags, straws, and bottles.

The aquarium is a founding partner of the Ocean Project, which conducts national public opinion surveys about aquariums and environmental issues. And, along with Stanford University, it runs an organization involved in ocean science, policy, and law called the Center for Ocean Solutions. The aquarium has participated in several international conferences that focus on ocean policy, including the 2017 United Nations Ocean Conference. In March 2017, Monterey Bay Aquarium publicly endorsed the March for Science—a series of rallies and marches that occurred around the world on Earth Day the following April—and its penguins marched in their own miniature demonstration.

== Educational efforts ==
Each year approximately 75,000 students, teachers, and chaperones from California access Monterey Bay Aquarium for free. An additional 1,500 low-income students, 350 teenagers, and 1,200 teachers participate in structured educational programs throughout the year. Between 1984 and 2014, the aquarium hosted more than 2 million students. In 2009, the aquarium and others collaborated to create an online resource called &quot;Climate Interpreter&quot;, which is used by other zoological institutions, government agencies, and academic institutions to share materials for interpreting climate change to the public.

The Bechtel Family Center for Ocean Education and Leadership, a facility, was proposed in 2018 with an initial estimated construction cost of US$30 million. Upon completion, the total cost rose to US$42 million. The center has doubled the number of students and teachers the aquarium can serve annually. Monterey Bay Aquarium received a Webby Award in 2000 for &quot;distributing information related to scientific exploration&quot; and has won four awards from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums for its programs in the categories of education and diversity. In 2015, the &quot;Silicon Valley Business Journal&quot; awarded the aquarium with a Community Impact Award for its efforts to &quot;shape a new generation of ocean conservation leaders.&quot;

== Community and economic influence ==
Monterey Bay Aquarium employed over 500 people and had 1,200 active volunteers in 2015. Between 1984 and 2014, 8,500 volunteers donated 3.2 million community service hours. The aquarium attracts around 2 million visitors each year and, through 2016, over 50 million people had visited. Out of the 51 accredited public aquariums in the United States in 2015, Monterey Bay Aquarium&#x27;s 2.08 million visitors ranked it second by number of visits, behind Georgia Aquarium&#x27;s 2.2 million. In 2015, it served 290,000 annual members.

Free admission programs are offered for Monterey County residents including &quot;Shelf to Shore&quot;, with the county&#x27;s free library system, and &quot;Free to Learn&quot;, with local nonprofit organizations and Monterey–Salinas Transit. Additionally, the aquarium offers free admission to Monterey County residents during a weeklong event in December, which grew from almost 17,000 visitors in 1998 to 50,000 visitors in 2013. In 2014, the program was expanded to include neighboring Santa Cruz and San Benito counties. An annual event called &quot;Día del Niño&quot; offers bilingual feeding presentations (in Spanish), activities, and free admission for children under the age of 13. Between 2002 and 2014, over 700,000 people visited for free through outreach programs.

In 2013, the aquarium&#x27;s operational spending and its 2 million visitors generated US$263 million to the economy of Monterey County. In August 2016, an event during one evening raised over US$110,000 for the Community Foundation for Monterey County&#x27;s drive to provide relief for the Soberanes Fire.

In December 2020, Natividad Medical Center in Salinas was loaned a deep-freeze fridge from the Aquarium in order to allow the hospital to store the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at -94 degrees Fahrenheit. Normally the aquarium uses the freezer for preserving &quot;biological and veterinary samples&quot;. Prior to the loan, the hospital had planned on keeping the vaccine on dry ice which would have meant changing the dry ice every five days. Due to the aquarium&#x27;s closure during the COVID-19 pandemic, between April 2020 and January 2021 a total of 243 staff were laid off or furloughed.

== In media and popular culture ==
Monterey Bay Aquarium has been featured in two documentaries on the wildlife television program &quot;Nature&quot;; filmmakers were given behind-the-scenes access for &quot;Oceans in Glass&quot; in 2006, and &quot;Saving Otter 501&quot; followed the aquarium&#x27;s sea otter rehabilitation program in 2013. It also heavily supported and was featured in BBC&#x27;s &quot;Big Blue Live&quot;, a 2015 live television miniseries about Monterey Bay that won a BAFTA TV Award in 2016. The aquarium served as the filming location for the fictitious Cetacean Institute in the 1986 film &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;. In the 2016 Disney/Pixar animated film &quot;Finding Dory&quot;, the aquarium inspired the design of the fish hospital that the characters visit, and its animals served as models for the film&#x27;s animated characters. A scene from the HBO miniseries &quot;Big Little Lies&quot;, which aired in 2017, was filmed there.

After comparing the aquarium&#x27;s visitor feedback to the feedback of other attractions, the media and the travel industry have given it top awards. In 2014, TripAdvisor ranked it as the number one public aquarium in the world and, in 2015, it ranked second. In 2015, it was listed by &quot;Parents&quot; magazine as the top public aquarium in the United States and the highest rated destination on the West Coast. Frommer&#x27;s travel guide lists Monterey Bay Aquarium as &quot;exceptional&quot;, the highest rating on its three-tier system.

Each year, since 2019, content creator DougDoug has held a Twitch livestream on the birthday of Monterey Bay Aquarium&#x27;s oldest sea otter, Rosa. The livestreams have raised a significant amount of money for the aquarium and, as of 2024, DougDoug and his community have raised over $1,000,000 for the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

<text>Terry Stephen Puhl (born July 8, 1956) is a Canadian former professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as a outfielder from 1977 to 1991, most prominently as a member of the Houston Astros where he helped the franchise win its first-ever National League Western Division title and postseason berth in .

A National League All-Star in 1978, Puhl excelled defensively as an outfielder, committing just 18 errors in 1,300 career games. His .993 fielding percentage is the best among outfielders in Astros history and ranks 8th all-time among all outfielders in National League (NL) history.

Puhl also served as the head coach of the University of Houston–Victoria&#x27;s baseball team and the manager of the Canada national baseball team. He was inducted into the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame in 1994 and, into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1995. He was inducted into the Houston Astros Hall of Fame in 2022.

==Early life==
Puhl was born and raised in Melville, Saskatchewan. In high school, he played baseball, volleyball, track and football. Pitching on a Midget League team, he led the club to a Canadian championship and was named the nation&#x27;s outstanding pitcher. He was signed by the Houston Astros in . Astros scout Harry Morgan signed Puhl to play in the outfield, a role that the pitcher had never played before.

== Playing career ==

=== Minor league career ===
Puhl made his professional debut with the rookie-league Covington Astros the following season, batting .284. Over the next three seasons, he advanced through the Astros&#x27; farm system, playing with the single-A Dubuque Packers in , then splitting the season between the double-A Columbus Astros and the triple-A Memphis Blues in , and finally with the triple-A Charleston Charlies in .

=== Major league career ===
Puhl was called up to the majors in July 1977, and never returned to the minor leagues. He was quickly installed as the club&#x27;s regular left fielder, replacing Jim Fuller. In his first major league game, on July 12, Puhl entered as a defensive replacement for Fuller. The following day, he got his first hit in the 13th inning of a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, off reliever Elías Sosa. Later that inning, Puhl scored the winning run on Bob Watson&#x27;s double. He finished the 1977 season with a .301 batting average in 60 games.

The following year, he was the sole Astro selected as a National League All-Star. He played in 149 games and batted .289 while having 169 hits, 25 doubles, and 32 stolen bases (the most he would ever have in a season). The following year, he would play 157 games (the most he would play in one season) while having his numbers rise and drop slightly, such as batting .287/.352/.377 while having 172 hits, 22 doubles, 49 RBIs, and 30 stolen bases. Puhl played a key part in the Astros making 1980 a banner year. He played in 141 games while batting .282 with 151 hits, 24 doubles, and 27 stolen bases. In the 1980 National League West tie-breaker game versus the Los Angeles Dodgers, he led off the game by reaching first base on an error and then scored the first run of the game when he charged into the catcher when running from third to home that dislodged the ball. The Astros won 7-1 to win their first NL West title. In the 1980 National League Championship Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, Puhl set a then NL-championship series record with a .526 batting average in a losing cause, the best performance ever by a hitter in a play-off series (it has since been superseded). As of 2019, Puhl has the 19th best lifetime fielding percentage by an outfielder (.993). He committed only 18 errors in 2,660 total chances. In 1981, he was named Canadian Baseball player of the year. That year, he played in 96 games while batting .251 while having 88 hits, 19 doubles, and 22 stolen bases. Puhl recorded his 1,000th hit off Tim Lollar on August 4, 1984, doing so on a single.

A pulled hamstring in 1985 and an ankle injury in 1986 reduced Puhl&#x27;s playing time. He would play just 57 games in 1985, 81 in 1986, and 90 in 1987 (batting .284, .244, and .230 respectively). He would have one more return to effective hitting in 1988, batting .303/.395/.389 in 113 games, having 71 hits and 22 stolen bases.

Puhl was granted free agent status in 1990, and signed with the New York Mets on December 13, 1990. He was released by the Mets during spring training on April 1, 1991, and signed by the Kansas City Royals on April 25, 1991. Puhl&#x27;s final MLB game was on May 29, 1991, after which he was released by the Royals on June 9, ending his MLB career. Puhl&#x27;s career statistics included a .280 batting average, 62 home runs, 676 runs, 435 RBIs, and 217 stolen bases. He accumulated 1,361 hits in 1,531 games. Puhl was particularly effective in postseason play, batting .372 in 13 games over three series. As of 2020, Puhl still ranks in the top ten in numerous categories for the Astros, such as WAR (10th, 28.5), games played (5th, 1,516), and hits (8th, 1,357).

== Post-playing career ==

After Puhl&#x27;s retirement in 1991, he was inducted into the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame in 1994 and to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1995. In November 2006, Puhl was inducted into the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame.

In August 2006, Puhl coached the Canadian National Senior team at the Olympic qualifier in Cuba. Canada advanced to the next round of qualifiers in 2007. In a 15–12 defeat of Panama, Puhl replaced catcher David Corrente with pinch hitter Reed Eastley in the eighth inning, despite the fact Corrente had four hits in four at bats. Eastley hit a three-run home run to tie the game. In the bottom of the ninth, Reed Eastley came to bat for a second time, this time with the bases loaded and the game on the line. Puhl instead called on pinch hitter Jeremy Ware, whose grand slam won the game for Canada.

In November 2006, Puhl was announced as the first head baseball coach at the University of Houston–Victoria. The UHV Jaguars were previously an independent team of the NAIA, but beginning in the 2015-16 season will compete as a member of the NAIA&#x27;s Red River Athletic Conference. He won his 300th career game on January 30, 2021.

Puhl&#x27;s son, Stephen Puhl, was a minor league baseball player. Selected in the 17th round (514th overall) of the 2006 Major League Baseball draft by the New York Mets, Stephen was originally a catcher in the Mets system in 2006 then pitched for the organization in 2007 and 2008.

On January 27, 2022, it was announced Puhl would be inducted into the Houston Astros Hall of Fame. In March 2022, Puhl announced he would retire from coaching the Jaguars at the end of the 2022 season.

On October 28, 2022 Puhl was selected to throw the ceremonial first pitch at Game One of the 2022 World Series between Houston and Philadelphia.

In retirement, Puhl entered the world of wealth management in Houston, partnering with former Astros teammate Craig Reynolds.

<doc id="88483" wikidata="Q8573" url="?curid=88483" title="Sun Yat-sen">
<text>Sun Yat-sen (; 12 November 186612 March 1925) was a Chinese physician, revolutionary, statesman, and political philosopher who founded the Republic of China (ROC) and its first political party, the Kuomintang (KMT). As the paramount leader of the 1911 Revolution, Sun is credited with overthrowing the Qing imperial dynasty and served as the first president of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912) and as the inaugural leader of the Kuomintang.

Born to a peasant family in Guangdong, Sun was educated overseas in Hawaii and returned to China to graduate from medical school in Hong Kong. He led underground anti-Qing revolutionaries in South China, the United Kingdom, and Japan as one of the Four Bandits and rose to prominence as the founder of multiple resistance movements, including the Revive China Society and the Tongmenghui. Although he is considered one of the most important figures of modern China, his political life campaigning against Manchu rule in favor of a Chinese republic featured constant struggles and frequent periods of exile. 

After the success of the 1911 Revolution, Sun proclaimed the establishment of the Republic of China but had to relinquish the presidency to general Yuan Shikai, ultimately going into exile in Japan. He later returned to launch a revolutionary government in southern China to challenge the warlords who controlled much of the country following Yuan&#x27;s death in 1916. In 1923, Sun invited representatives of the Communist International to Guangzhou to reorganize the KMT and formed the First United Front with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). He did not live to see his party unify the country under his successor, Chiang Kai-shek, in the Northern Expedition. While residing in Beijing, Sun died of gallbladder cancer in 1925.

Uniquely among 20th-century Chinese leaders, Sun is revered in both Taiwan (where he is officially the &quot;Father of the Nation&quot;) and in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (where he is officially the &quot;Forerunner of the Revolution&quot;) for his instrumental role in ending Qing rule and overseeing the conclusion of the Chinese dynastic system. His political philosophy, known as the Three Principles of the People, sought to modernise China by advocating for nationalism, democracy, and the livelihood of the people in an ethnically harmonious union (&quot;Zhonghua minzu&quot;). The philosophy is commemorated as the National Anthem of the Republic of China, which Sun composed.

== Names ==
Sun&#x27;s was Sun Deming (Cantonese: ; ). As a child, his milk name was Tai Tseung (; ). In school, a teacher gave him the name Sun Wen (; ), which was used by Sun for most of his life. Sun&#x27;s courtesy name was Zaizhi (; ), and his baptized name was Rixin (; ). While at school in British Hong Kong, he got the art name Yat-sen (). Sun Zhongshan (; , also romanized &quot;Chung Shan&quot;), the most popular of his Chinese names in China, is derived from his Japanese name &quot;Kikori Nakayama&quot; (; ), the pseudonym given to him by Tōten Miyazaki when he was in hiding in Japan. His birthplace city was renamed Zhongshan in his honour likely shortly after his death in 1925. Zhongshan is one of the few cities named after people in China and has remained the official name of the city during Communist rule.

== Early years ==
=== Birthplace and early life ===
Sun Deming was born on 12 November 1866 to Sun Dacheng and Madame Yang. His birthplace was the village of Cuiheng, Xiangshan County (now Zhongshan City), Canton Province (now Guangdong). He was of Hakka and Cantonese descent. His father owned very little land and worked as a tailor in Macau and as a journeyman and a porter. After finishing primary education and meeting childhood friend Lu Haodong, he moved to Honolulu in the Kingdom of Hawaii, where he lived a comfortable life of modest wealth supported by his elder brother Sun Mei.

=== Education ===

During his stay in Honolulu, Sun began his education at the age of 10, attending secondary school in Hawaii. In 1878, after receiving a few years of local schooling, a 13-year-old Sun went to live with his elder brother Sun Mei, who would later make major contributions to overthrowing the Qing dynasty, and who financed Sun&#x27;s attendance of the ʻIolani School. There, he studied English, British history, mathematics, science, and Christianity. Sun was initially unable to speak English, but quickly acquired it, received a prize for academic achievement from King Kalākaua, and graduated in 1882. He then attended Oahu College (now known as Punahou School) for one semester. By 1883, Sun&#x27;s interest in Christianity had become deeply worrisome for his brother—who, seeing his conversion as inevitable, sent Sun back to China.

Upon returning to China, a 17-year-old Sun met with his childhood friend Lu Haodong at the Beiji Temple () in Cuiheng, where villagers engaged in traditional folk healing and worshipped an effigy of the North Star God. Feeling contemptuous of these practices, Sun and Lu incurred the wrath of their fellow villagers by breaking the wooden idol; as a result, Sun&#x27;s parents felt compelled to dispatch him to Hong Kong. In November 1883, Sun began attending the Diocesan Home and Orphanage on Eastern Street (now the Diocesan Boys&#x27; School), and from 15 April 1884 he attended The Government Central School on Gough Street (now Queen&#x27;s College), until graduating in 1886.

In 1886, Sun studied medicine at the Guangzhou Boji Hospital under the Christian missionary John Glasgow Kerr. According to his book &quot;Kidnapped in London&quot;, in 1887 Sun heard of the opening of the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese (the forerunner of the University of Hong Kong). He immediately sought to attend, and went on to obtain a license to practice medicine from the institution in 1892; out of a class of twelve students, Sun was one of two who graduated.

== Religious views and Christian baptism ==
In the early 1880s, Sun Mei had sent his brother to ʻIolani School, which was under the supervision of the Church of Hawaii and directed by an Anglican prelate, Alfred Willis, with the language of instruction being English. At the school, the young Sun first came in contact with Christianity.

Sun was later baptized in Hong Kong on 4 May 1884 by Rev. Charles Robert Hager, an American missionary of the Congregational Church of the United States (American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions), to his brother&#x27;s disdain. The minister would also develop a friendship with Sun. Sun attended To Tsai Church (), founded by the London Missionary Society in 1888, while he studied medicine in Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese. Sun pictured a revolution as similar to the salvation mission of the Christian church. His conversion to Christianity was related to his revolutionary ideals and push for advancement.

== Becoming a revolutionary ==
=== Four Bandits ===

During the Qing-dynasty rebellion around 1888, Sun was in Hong Kong with a group of revolutionary thinkers, nicknamed the Four Bandits, at the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese.

=== From Furen Literary Society to Revive China Society ===
In 1891, Sun met revolutionary friends in Hong Kong including Yeung Ku-wan who was the leader and founder of the Furen Literary Society. The group was spreading the idea of overthrowing the Qing. In 1894, Sun wrote an 8,000-character petition to Qing Viceroy Li Hongzhang presenting his ideas for modernizing China. He traveled to Tianjin to personally present the petition to Li but was not granted an audience. After that experience, Sun turned irrevocably toward revolution. He left China for Hawaii and founded the Revive China Society, which was committed to revolutionizing China&#x27;s prosperity. It was the first Chinese nationalist revolutionary society. Members were drawn mainly from Chinese expatriates, especially from the lower social classes. The same month in 1894, the Furen Literary Society was merged with the Hong Kong chapter of the Revive China Society. Thereafter, Sun became the secretary of the newly merged Revive China Society, which Yeung Ku-wan headed as president. They disguised their activities in Hong Kong under the running of a business under the name &quot;Kuen Hang Club&quot; ().

=== Heaven and Earth Society and overseas travels to seek financial support ===
A &quot;Heaven and Earth Society&quot; sect known as Tiandihui had been around for a long time. The group has also been referred to as the &quot;three cooperating organizations&quot;, as well as the triads. Sun mainly used the group to leverage his overseas travels to gain further financial and resource support for his revolution.

=== First Sino-Japanese War ===
In 1895, China suffered a serious defeat during the First Sino-Japanese War. There were two types of responses. One group of intellectuals contended that the Manchu Qing government could restore its legitimacy by successfully modernizing. Stressing that overthrowing the Manchu would result in chaos and would lead to China being carved up by imperialists, intellectuals like Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao supported responding with initiatives like the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform. In another faction, Sun Yat-sen and others like Zou Rong wanted a revolution to replace the dynastic system with a modern nation-state in the form of a republic. The Hundred Days&#x27; reform turned out to be a failure by 1898.

== First uprising and exile ==
=== First Guangzhou Uprising ===
In the second year of the establishment of the Revive China Society, on 26 October 1895, the group planned and launched the First Guangzhou uprising against the Qing in Guangzhou. Yeung Ku-wan directed the uprising starting from Hong Kong. However, plans were leaked out, and more than 70 members, including Lu Haodong, were captured by the Qing government. The uprising was a failure. Sun received financial support mostly from his brother, who sold most of his 12,000 acres of ranch and cattle in Hawaii. Additionally, members of his family and relatives of Sun would take refuge at the home of his brother Sun Mei at Kamaole in Kula, Maui.

=== Exile in the United Kingdom ===
While in exile in London in 1896, Sun raised money for his revolutionary party and to support uprisings in China. While the events leading up to it are unclear, Sun Yat-sen was detained at the Chinese Legation in London, where the Chinese secret service planned to smuggle him back to China to execute him for his revolutionary actions. He was released after 12 days by the efforts of James Cantlie, &quot;The Globe&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, and the Foreign Office, which left Sun a hero in the United Kingdom. James Cantlie, Sun&#x27;s former teacher at the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese, maintained a lifelong friendship with Sun and later wrote an early biography of him Sun wrote a book in 1897 about his detention, &quot;Kidnapped in London.&quot;

=== Exile in Japan ===

Sun traveled by way of Canada to Japan to begin his exile there. He arrived in Yokohama on 16 August 1897 and met with the Japanese politician Tōten Miyazaki. Most Japanese who actively worked with Sun were motivated by a pan-Asian opposition to Western imperialism. In Japan, Sun also met Mariano Ponce, a diplomat of the First Philippine Republic.

During the Philippine Revolution and the Philippine–American War, Sun helped Ponce procure weapons that had been salvaged from the Imperial Japanese Army and ship the weapons to the Philippines. By helping the Philippine Republic, Sun hoped that the Filipinos would retain their independence so that he could be sheltered in the country in staging another Chinese revolution. However, as the war ended in July 1902, the United States emerged victorious from a bitter three-year war against the Republic. Therefore, Sun did not have the opportunity to ally with the Philippines in his revolution in China.

In 1897, through an introduction by Miyazaki Toten, Sun Yat-sen met Tōyama Mitsuru of the political organization Genyosha. Through Tōyama, he received financial support for his activities and living expenses in Tokyo from . Additionally, his residence, a 2,000-square-meter mansion in Waseda-Tsurumaki-cho, was arranged by Inukai Tsuyoshi.

In 1899, the Boxer Rebellion occurred. The following year, Sun Yat-sen attempted another uprising in Huizhou, but it ended in failure. In 1902, despite already having a wife in China, he married the Japanese woman Kaoru Otsuki. Furthermore, he kept as a mistress and frequently had her accompany him.

== From failed uprisings to revolution ==
=== Huizhou Uprising ===
On 22 October 1900, Sun ordered the launch of the Huizhou Uprising to attack Huizhou and provincial authorities in Guangdong. That came five years after the failed Guangzhou Uprising. This time, Sun appealed to the triads for help. The uprising was another failure. Miyazaki, who participated in the revolt with Sun, wrote an account of the revolutionary effort under the title &quot;33-Year Dream&quot; () in 1902.

=== Getting support from Siamese Chinese ===
In 1903, Sun made a secret trip to Bangkok in which he sought funds for his cause in Southeast Asia. His loyal followers published newspapers, providing invaluable support to the dissemination of his revolutionary principles and ideals among Siamese Chinese in Siam. In Bangkok, Sun visited Yaowarat Road, in the city&#x27;s Chinatown. On that street, Sun gave a speech claiming that Overseas Chinese were &quot;the Mother of the Revolution.&quot; He also met the local Chinese merchant Seow Houtseng, who sent financial support to him.

Sun&#x27;s speech on Yaowarat Road was commemorated by the street later being named &quot;Sun Yat Sen Street&quot; or &quot;Soi Sun Yat Sen&quot; () in his honour.

===Getting support from American Chinese===
According to Lee Yun-ping, chairman of the Chinese historical society, Sun needed a certificate to enter the United States since the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 would have otherwise blocked him.

In March 1904, while residing in Kula, Maui, Sun Yat-sen obtained a Certificate of Hawaiian Birth, issued by the Territory of Hawaii, stating that &quot;he was born in the Hawaiian Islands on the 24th day of November, A.D. 1870.&quot; He renounced it after it served its purpose to circumvent the Chinese Exclusion Act. Official files of the United States show that Sun had United States nationality, moved to China with his family at age 4, and returned to Hawaii 10 years later.

On 6 April 1904, on his first attempt to enter the United States, Sun Yat-sen landed in San Francisco. He was detained and faced with possible deportation. Sun, represented by the law firm of Ralston &amp; Siddons, based in Washington DC, filed an appeal with the Commissioner-General of Immigration on 26 April 1904. On 28 April 1904, the acting secretary of the Department of Commerce and Labor in a four-page decision contained in the case file, set aside the order of deportation and ordered the Commissioner of Immigration in San Francisco to &quot;permit the said Sun Yat-sen to land.&quot; Sun was then freed to embark on his fundraising tour in the United States.

=== Returned to exile in Japan ===

In 1900, Sun Yat-sen temporarily exiled himself to Japan again. During his stay in Japan, he expressed his thoughts to Inukai Tsuyoshi, saying, &quot;The Meiji Restoration is the first step of the Chinese revolution, and the Chinese revolution is the second step of the Meiji Restoration.&quot;

Around this time, Sun married Soong Ching-ling, the second daughter of , who was also a Hakka like him. There are various theories about the year of their marriage, but it is generally believed to have taken place between 1913 and 1916 while Sun was exiled in Japan. The arrangement of their marriage was supported by Umeya Shokichi, a Japanese supporter who provided financial aid.

At that time, Fusanosuke Kuhara, a prominent figure in Japan’s political and business circles, invited Sun to his villa, the Nihonkan, located where the current restaurant &quot;Kochuan&quot; in Shirokane Happo-en stands. Kuhara offered Sun the newly built &quot;Orchid Room&quot; to encourage and support his friend living in a foreign land.

The Orchid Room was equipped with a secret escape route known as &quot;Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Escape Passage.&quot; This precautionary measure included a hidden door behind the fireplace, which led to an underground tunnel, providing an escape route in case of emergencies.

===Unifying forces of Tongmenghui in Tokyo===
In 1904, Sun Yat-sen came about with the goal &quot;to expel the Tatar barbarians (specifically, the Manchu), to revive Zhonghua, to establish a Republic, and to distribute land equally among the people&quot; (). One of Sun&#x27;s major legacies was the creation of his political philosophy of the Three Principles of the People. These Principles included the principle of nationalism (minzu, ), of democracy (minquan, ), and of welfare (minsheng, ).

On 20 August 1905, Sun joined forces with revolutionary Chinese students studying in Tokyo to form the unified group Tongmenghui (United League), which sponsored uprisings in China. By 1906 the number of Tongmenghui members reached 963.

=== Getting support from Malayan Chinese ===

Sun&#x27;s notability and popularity extended beyond the Greater China region, particularly to Nanyang (Southeast Asia), where a large concentration of overseas Chinese resided in Malaya (Malaysia and Singapore). In Singapore, he met the local Chinese merchants Teo Eng Hock (), Tan Chor Nam () and Lim Nee Soon (), which mark the commencement of direct support from the Nanyang Chinese. The Singapore chapter of the Tongmenghui was established on 6 April 1906, but some records claim the founding date to be end of 1905. The villa used by Sun was known as Wan Qing Yuan. Singapore then was the headquarters of the Tongmenghui.

After founding the Tongmenghui, Sun advocated the establishment of the &quot;Chong Shing Yit Pao&quot; as the alliance&#x27;s mouthpiece to promote revolutionary ideas. Later, he initiated the establishment of reading clubs across Singapore and Malaysia to disseminate revolutionary ideas by the lower class through public readings of newspaper stories. The United Chinese Library, founded on 8 August 1910, was one such reading club, first set up at leased property on the second floor of the Wan He Salt Traders in North Boat Quay.

The first actual United Chinese Library building was built between 1908 and 1911 below Fort Canning, on 51 Armenian Street, and commenced operations in 1912. The library was set up as a part of the 50 reading rooms by the Chinese republicans to serve as an information station and liaison point for the revolutionaries. In 1987, the library was moved to its present site at Cantonment Road.

=== Uprisings ===
On 1 December 1907, Sun led the Zhennanguan Uprising against the Qing at Friendship Pass, which is the border between Guangxi and Vietnam. The uprising failed after seven days of fighting. In 1907, there were a total of four failed uprisings, including Huanggang uprising, Huizhou seven women lake uprising and Qinzhou uprising. In 1908, two more uprisings failed: the Qin-lian Uprising and Hekou Uprising.

=== Anti-Sun factionalism ===
Because of the failures, Sun&#x27;s leadership was challenged by elements from within the Tongmenghui who wished to remove him as leader. In Tokyo, members from the recently merged Restoration society raised doubts about Sun&#x27;s credentials. Tao Chengzhang and Zhang Binglin publicly denounced Sun in an open leaflet, &quot;A declaration of Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Criminal Acts by the Revolutionaries in Southeast Asia&quot;, which was printed and distributed in reformist newspapers like &quot;Nanyang Zonghui Bao&quot;. The goal was to target Sun as a leader leading a revolt only for profiteering.

The revolutionaries were polarized and split between pro-Sun and anti-Sun camps. Sun publicly fought off comments about how he had something to gain financially from the revolution. However, by 19 July 1910, the Tongmenghui headquarters had to relocate from Singapore to Penang to reduce the anti-Sun activities. It was also in Penang that Sun and his supporters would launch the first Chinese &quot;daily&quot; newspaper, the &quot;Kwong Wah Yit Poh&quot;, in December 1910.

=== 1911 revolution ===
To sponsor more uprisings, Sun made a personal plea for financial aid at the Penang conference, held on 13 November 1910 in Malaya. The high-powered preparatory meeting of Sun&#x27;s supporters was subsequently held in Ipoh, Singapore, at the villa of Teh Lay Seng, the chairman of the Tungmenghui, to raise funds for the Huanghuagang Uprising, also known as the Yellow Flower Mound Uprising. The Ipoh leaders were Teh Lay Seng, Wong I Ek, Lee Guan Swee, and Lee Hau Cheong. The leaders launched a major drive for donations across the Malay Peninsula and raised HK$187,000.

On 27 April 1911, the revolutionary Huang Xing led the Yellow Flower Mound Uprising against the Qing. The revolt failed and ended in disaster. The bodies of only 72 revolutionaries were identified of the 86 that were found. The revolutionaries are remembered as martyrs.
Despite the failure of this uprising, which was due to a leak, it was successful in triggering off the trend of nation-wide revolts.

On 10 October 1911, the military Wuchang Uprising took place and was led again by Huang Xing. The uprising expanded to the Xinhai Revolution, also known as the &quot;Chinese Revolution&quot;, to overthrow the last emperor, Puyi. Sun had no direct involvement in it, as he was in Denver, Colorado, and had spent much of the year in the United States in search of support from Chinese Americans. That made Huang be in charge of the revolution that ended over 2000 years of imperial rule in China. On 12 October, when Sun learned of the successful rebellion against the Qing emperor from press reports, he returned to China from the United States and was accompanied by his closest foreign advisor, the American &quot;General&quot; Homer Lea, an adventurer whom Sun had met in London when they attempted to arrange British financing for the future Chinese republic. Both sailed for China, arriving there on 21 December 1911.
== Republic of China with multiple governments ==
=== Provisional government ===
On 29 December 1911, a meeting of representatives from provinces in Nanjing elected Sun as the provisional president. 1 January 1912 was set as the epoch of the new republican calendar. Li Yuanhong was made provisional vice-president, and Huang Xing became the minister of the army. A new provisional government for the Republic of China was created, along with a provisional constitution. Sun is credited for funding the revolutions and for keeping revolutionary spirit alive, even after a series of false starts. His successful merger of smaller revolutionary groups into a single coherent party provided a better base for those who shared revolutionary ideals. Under Sun&#x27;s provisional government, several innovations were introduced, such as the aforementioned calendar system, and fashionable Zhongshan suits.

=== Beiyang government ===

Yuan Shikai, who was in control of the Beiyang Army, had been promised the position of president of the Republic of China if he could get the Qing court to abdicate. On 12 February 1912, the Emperor did abdicate the throne. Sun stepped down as president, and Yuan became the new provisional president in Beijing on 10 March 1912. The provisional government did not have any military forces of its own. Its control over elements of the new army that had mutinied was limited, and significant forces still had not declared against the Qing.

Sun Yat-sen sent telegrams to the leaders of all provinces to request them to elect and to establish the National Assembly of the Republic of China in 1912. In May 1912, the legislative assembly moved from Nanjing to Beijing, with its 120 members divided between members of the Tongmenghui and a republican party that supported Yuan Shikai. Many revolutionary members were already alarmed by Yuan&#x27;s ambitions and the northern-based Beiyang government.

=== New Nationalist party in 1912, failed Second Revolution and new exile ===
The Tongmenghui member Song Jiaoren quickly tried to control the assembly. He mobilized the old Tongmenghui at the core with the mergers of a number of new small parties to form a new political party, the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party, commonly abbreviated as &quot;KMT&quot;) on 25 August 1912 at Huguang Guild Hall, Beijing. The 1912–1913 National assembly election was considered a huge success for the KMT, which won 269 of the 596 seats in the lower house and 123 of the 274 seats in the upper house. In retaliation, the KMT leader Song Jiaoren was assassinated, almost certainly by a secret order of Yuan, on 20 March 1913. The Second Revolution took place by Sun and KMT military forces trying to overthrow Yuan&#x27;s forces of about 80,000 men in an armed conflict in July 1913. The revolt against Yuan was unsuccessful. In August 1913, Sun fled to Japan, where he later enlisted financial aid by the politician and industrialist Fusanosuke Kuhara.

=== Warlords chaos ===
In 1915, Yuan proclaimed the Empire of China with himself as Emperor of China. Sun took part in the National Protection War of the Constitutional Protection Movement and also supported bandit leaders like Bai Lang during the Bai Lang Rebellion, which marked the beginning of the Warlord Era. In 1915, Sun wrote to the Second International, a socialist-based organization in Paris, and asked it to send a team of specialists to help China set up the world&#x27;s first socialist republic. The same year, Sun received the Indian communist M.N. Roy as a guest. There were then many theories and proposals of what China could be. In the political mess, both Sun Yat-sen and Xu Shichang were announced as president of the Republic of China.

== Alliance with Communist Party and Northern Expedition ==
=== Guangzhou militarist government ===

China had become divided among regional military leaders. Sun saw the danger and returned to China in 1916 to advocate Chinese reunification. In 1921, he started a self-proclaimed military government in Guangzhou and was elected Grand Marshal. Between 1912 and 1927, three governments were set up in South China: the Provisional government in Nanjing (1912), the Military government in Guangzhou (1921–1925), and the National government in Guangzhou and later Wuhan (1925–1927). The governments in the south were established to rival the Beiyang government in the north. Yuan Shikai had banned the KMT. The short-lived Chinese Revolutionary Party was a temporary replacement for the KMT. On 10 October 1919, Sun resurrected the KMT with the new name Chung-kuo Kuomintang, or &quot;Nationalist Party of China.&quot;

=== First United Front ===
Sun was now convinced that the only hope for a unified China lay in a military conquest from his base in the south, followed by a period of , which would culminate in the transition to democracy. To hasten the conquest of China, he began a policy of active co-operation with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Sun and the Soviet Union&#x27;s Adolph Joffe signed the Sun-Joffe Manifesto in January 1923. Sun received help from the Comintern for his acceptance of communist members into his KMT. Sun received assistance from Soviet advisor Mikhail Borodin, whom Sun described as his &quot;Lafayette&quot;. The Russian revolutionary and socialist leader Vladimir Lenin praised Sun and his KMT for its ideology, principles, attempts at social reformation, and fight against foreign imperialism. Sun also returned the praise by calling Lenin a &quot;great man&quot; and indicated that he wished to follow the same path as Lenin. In 1923, after having been in contact with Lenin and other Moscow communists, Sun sent representatives to study the Red Army, and in turn, the Soviets sent representatives to help reorganize the KMT at Sun&#x27;s request.

With the Soviets&#x27; help, Sun was able to develop the military power needed for the Northern Expedition against the military at the north. He established the Whampoa Military Academy near Guangzhou with Chiang Kai-shek as the commandant of the National Revolutionary Army (NRA). Other Whampoa leaders include Wang Jingwei and Hu Hanmin as political instructors. This full collaboration was called the First United Front.

=== Financial concerns ===
In 1924 Sun appointed his brother-in-law T. V. Soong to set up the first Chinese central bank, the Canton Central Bank. To establish national capitalism and a banking system was a major objective for the KMT. However, Sun met opposition by the Canton Merchant Volunteers Corps Uprising against him.

== Final years==

=== Final speeches ===

In February 1923, Sun made a presentation to the Students&#x27; Union in Hong Kong University and declared that the corruption of China and the peace, order, and good government of Hong Kong had turned him into a revolutionary. The same year, he delivered a speech in which he proclaimed his Three Principles of the People as the foundation of the country and the Five-Yuan Constitution as the guideline for the political system and bureaucracy. Part of the speech was made into the National Anthem of the Republic of China.

On 10 November 1924, Sun traveled north to Tianjin and delivered a speech to suggest a gathering for a &quot;national conference&quot; for the Chinese people. He called for the end of warlord rules and the abolition of all unequal treaties with the Western powers. Two days later, he traveled to Beijing to discuss the future of the country despite his deteriorating health and the ongoing civil war of the warlords. Among the people whom he met was the Muslim warlord General Ma Fuxiang, who informed Sun that he would welcome Sun&#x27;s leadership. On 28 November 1924 Sun traveled to Japan and gave a at Kobe, Japan.

=== Illness and death ===
For many years, it was popularly believed that Sun died of liver cancer. On 26 January 1925, Sun underwent an exploratory laparotomy at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) to investigate a long-term illness. It was performed by the head of the Department of Surgery, Adrian S. Taylor, who stated that the procedure &quot;revealed extensive involvement of the liver by carcinoma&quot; and that Sun had only about ten days to live. Sun was hospitalized, and his condition was treated with radium. Sun survived the initial ten-day period, and on 18 February, against the advice of doctors, he was transferred to the KMT headquarters and treated with traditional Chinese medicine. That was also unsuccessful, and he died on 12 March, at the age of 58. Contemporary reports in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and the Chinese newspaper &quot;Qun Qiang Bao&quot; all reported the cause of death as liver cancer, based on Taylor&#x27;s observation. He also left a short political will (), penned by Wang Jingwei, which had a widespread influence in the subsequent development of the Republic of China and Taiwan.

His body then was preserved in mineral oil and taken to the Temple of Azure Clouds, a Buddhist shrine in the Western Hills a few miles outside Beijing. A glass-covered steel coffin was sent by the Soviet Union to the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall at Temple of Azure Clouds as a permanent repository for the body but was ultimately declined by the family as unsuitable. The body was embalmed for preservation by Peking Union Medical College who reportedly guaranteed its preservation for 150 years.

In 1926, construction began on a majestic mausoleum at the foot of Purple Mountain in Nanjing, which was completed in the spring of 1929. On 1 June 1929, Sun&#x27;s remains were moved from Beijing and interred in the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum.

By pure chance, in May 2016, an American pathologist, Rolf F. Barth, was visiting the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Guangzhou when he noticed a faded copy of the original autopsy report on display. The autopsy was performed immediately after Sun&#x27;s death by James Cash, a pathologist at PUMCH. Based on a tissue sample, Cash concluded that the cause of death was an adenocarcinoma in the gallbladder that had metastasized to the liver. In modern China, liver cancer is far more common than gallbladder cancer. Although the incidence rates for either one in 1925 are not known, if one assumes that they were similar at the time, the original diagnosis by Taylor was a reasonable conclusion. From the time of Sun&#x27;s death to the appearance of Barth&#x27;s report in the &quot;Chinese Journal of Cancer&quot; in September 2016, Sun&#x27;s true cause of death was not reported in any English-language publication. Even in Chinese-language sources, it appeared in only one non-medical online report in 2013.

== Legacy ==
=== Power struggle ===

After Sun&#x27;s death, a power struggle between his young protégé Chiang Kai-shek and his old revolutionary comrade Wang Jingwei split the KMT. At stake in the struggle was the right to lay claim to Sun&#x27;s ambiguous legacy. In 1927, Chiang married Soong Mei-ling, a sister of Sun&#x27;s widow Soong Ching-ling, and he could now claim to be a brother-in-law of Sun. When the Communists and the Kuomintang split in 1927, which marked the start of the Chinese Civil War, each group claimed to be his true heirs, and the conflict that continued until World War II. Sun&#x27;s widow, Soong Ching-ling, sided with the Communists during the Chinese Civil War and was critical of Chiang&#x27;s regime since the Shanghai massacre in 1927. She served from 1949 to 1981 as vice-president (or vice-chairwoman) of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and as honorary president shortly before her death in 1981.

=== Personality cult ===
A personality cult in the Republic of China was centered on Sun and his successor, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. The cult was created after Sun Yat-sen died. Chinese Muslim generals and imams participated in the personality cult and the one-party state, with Muslim General Ma Bufang making people bow to Sun&#x27;s portrait and listen to the national anthem during a Tibetan and Mongol religious ceremony for the Qinghai Lake god. Quotes from the Qur&#x27;an and the Hadith were used by Hui Muslims to justify Chiang&#x27;s rule over China.

The Kuomintang&#x27;s constitution designated Sun as the party president. After his death, the Kuomintang opted to keep that language in its constitution to honor his memory forever. The party has since been headed by a director-general (1927–1975) and a chairman (since 1975), who discharge the functions of the president.

Though he took a stance against idolatry in life, Sun sometimes became worshiped as a god among people. For example, a KMT committee member Hsieh Kun-hong controversially referred to Sun as having &quot;become immortal&quot; after death under the posthumous name of &quot;Great Merciful True Monarch&quot; () in 2021. Sun is already worshipped in the syncretic Vietnamese religion of Caodaism.

=== Father of the Nation ===

Sun Yat-sen remains unique among 20th-century Chinese leaders for having a high reputation in both Mainland China and Taiwan. In Taiwan, he is seen as the Father of the Republic of China and is known by the posthumous name &quot;Father of the Nation, Mr. Sun Zhongshan&quot; (, and the one-character space is a traditional homage symbol).

=== Forerunner of revolution ===

In Mainland China, Sun is seen as a Chinese nationalist, a proto-socialist, and the first president of a Republican China and is highly regarded as the Forerunner of the Revolution (). He is even mentioned by name in the preamble to the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In recent years, the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party has increasingly invoked Sun, partly as a way of bolstering Chinese nationalism in light of the Chinese economic reform and partly to increase connections with supporters of the Kuomintang on Taiwan, which the People&#x27;s Republic of China sees as allies against Taiwan independence. Sun&#x27;s tomb was one of the first stops made by the leaders of both the Kuomintang and the People First Party on their pan-blue visit to mainland China in 2005. A massive portrait of Sun continues to appear in Tiananmen Square for May Day and National Day.

In 1956, Mao Zedong said, &quot;Let us pay tribute to our great revolutionary forerunner, Dr. Sun Yat-sen!... he bequeathed to us much that is useful in the sphere of political thought.&quot;

Xi Jinping incorporates Sun&#x27;s legacy into his discourse on national rejuvenation. Xi describes Sun as the first person to propose a method for Chinese revival, including adopting the first blueprint for China&#x27;s modernization.

=== New Three Principles of the People ===

Sun&#x27;s Three Principles of the People has been reinterpreted by the Chinese Communist Party to argue that communism is a necessary conclusion of them and thus provide legitimacy for the government. This reinterpretation of the Three Principles of the People is commonly referred to as the New Three Principles of the People (, also translated as &quot;neo-tridemism&quot;), a word coined by Mao&#x27;s 1940 essay &quot;On New Democracy&quot; in which he argued that the Communist Party is a better enforcer of the Three Principles of the People compared to the bourgeois Kuomintang and that the new three principles are about allying with the communists and the Russians (Soviets) and supporting the peasants and the workers. Proponents of the New Three Principles of the People claim that Sun&#x27;s book Three Principles of the People acknowledges that the principles of welfare is inherently socialistic and communistic.

During the 90th anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution in 2001, former CCP General Secretary Jiang Zemin claimed that Sun supposedly advocated for the &quot;New Three Principles of the People.&quot; In 2001, Sun&#x27;s granddaughter Lily Sun said that the Chinese Communists were distorting Sun&#x27;s legacy. She again voiced her displeasure in 2002 in a private letter to Jiang about the distortion of history. In 2008 Jiang Zemin was willing to offer US$10 million to sponsor a Xinhai Revolution anniversary celebration event. According to &quot;Ming Pao&quot;, she did not take the money because then she would not &quot;have the freedom to properly communicate the Revolution.&quot;

=== KMT emblem removal case ===
In 1981, Lily Sun took a trip to Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing. The emblem of the KMT had been removed from the top of his sacrificial hall at the time of her visit but was later restored. On another visit in May 2011, she was surprised to find the four-character &quot;General Rules of Meetings&quot; (), a document that Sun wrote in reference to Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order had been removed from a stone carving.

===Founding father of the nation debate===
In 1940, the Republic of China (ROC) government had bestowed the title of &quot;father of the nation&quot; on Sun. However, after 1949, as a result of the Chiang regime&#x27;s arrival in Taiwan, his &quot;father of the nation&quot; designation continued only in Taiwan.

Sun visited Taiwan briefly on only three occasions (in 1900, 1913, and 1918) or four by counting 1924, when his boat had stopped in Keelung Harbor, but he did not disembark.

In November 2004, the Taiwanese Ministry of Education proposed that Sun was not the father of Taiwan. Instead, Sun was a foreigner from mainland China. Taiwanese Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng and the Examination Yuan member , both of whom supported the proposal, had their portraits pelted with eggs in protest. At a Sun Yat-sen statue in Kaohsiung, a 70-year-old retired soldier of the Republic of China committed suicide on Sun&#x27;s birthday, 12 November, to protest the ministry&#x27;s proposal.

== Views ==

===Western culture===
As a lifelong Christian who never left Christianity, Sun Yat-sen was a loyal follower of Western modernity and Christianity and saw it as the best way to develop the Chinese nation. He went on foreign trips to gather support and resources of Western and Christian nations. He was highly critical of anything from ancient Chinese which did not confirm to Western standards and idols, this led him and his group to break idols and denounce Chinese medicine amongst other things.

===Economic development===
Sun Yat-sen spent years in Hawaii as a student in the late 1870s and early 1880s and was highly impressed with the economic development that he saw there. He used the Kingdom of Hawaii as a model to develop his vision of a technologically modern, politically independent, actively anti-imperialist China. Sun, an important pioneer of international development, proposed in the 1920s international institutions of the sort that appeared after World War II. He focused on China, with its vast potential and weak base of mostly local entrepreneurs.

His key proposal was socialism. He proposed:
:The State will take over all the large enterprises; we shall encourage and protect enterprises which may reasonably be entrusted to the people; the nation will possess equality with other nations; every Chinese will be equal to every other Chinese both politically and in his opportunities of economic advancement.

He also proposed, &quot;If we use existing foreign capital to build up a future communist society in China, half the work will bring double the results.&quot; He also said, &quot;It is my idea to make capitalism create socialism in China.&quot;

Sun promoted the ideas of the economist Henry George and was influenced by Georgist ideas on land ownership and a land value tax.

===Culture===
Sun supported natalism and had eugenic ideals. He favored premarital health examinations, sterilization of those perceived as unfit, and other programs for socially engineering China&#x27;s population. In Sun&#x27;s view, China had only endured Western invasions and colonial rule because of its large population. Those views led him to oppose the use of birth control.

===Pan-Asianism===
Sun was a proponent of Pan-Asianism. He said that Asia was the &quot;cradle of the world&#x27;s oldest civilisation&quot; and that &quot;even the ancient civilisations of the West, of Greece and Rome, had their origins on Asiatic soil.&quot; He thought that it was only in recent times that Asians &quot;gradually degenerated and become weak.&quot; For Sun, &quot;Pan-Asianism is based on the principle of the Rule of Right, and justifies the avenging of wrongs done to others.&quot; He advocated overthrowing the Western &quot;Rule of Might&quot; and &quot;seeking a civilisation of peace and equality and the emancipation of all races.&quot;

==Relationship with Japan==
===Meiji Restoration and Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Revolutionary Views===

According to , one of the reasons why figures like Miyazaki Toten, , and supported Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s revolutionary movement was because the ideals of the Meiji Restoration or the Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement could not be realized in Japan, and they sought to compensate for that failure.

However, Sun Yat-sen himself stated the following in 1919: 
:The Chinese Nationalist Party is, after all, the revolutionaries of Japan from 50 years ago. Japan, a weak country in the East, was fortunate to have revolutionaries from the Meiji Restoration, who, for the first time, rallied and transformed Japan from a weak country to a strong one. Our revolutionaries also followed the path of Japan&#x27;s revolutionaries, seeking to transform China.

In 1923, he also said: 
:Japan&#x27;s Meiji Restoration was the cause of the Chinese revolution, and the Chinese revolution was the result of Japan&#x27;s Meiji Restoration. Both are originally connected and work together to achieve the revival of East Asia.

Based on his empathy for the Meiji Restoration, Sun Yat-sen sought collaboration between Japan and China. For him, Japan&#x27;s Twenty-One Demands on China represented a betrayal of the &quot;revolutionary aspirations&quot; of the Meiji patriots and advanced Japan&#x27;s policy of aggression against China.

=== Relationship with the Japanese ===

During his lifetime, Sun Yat-sen had a wide range of relationships with Japanese people. Through the mediation of Inukai Tsuyoshi, he became acquainted with Miyazaki Toten, Tōyama Mitsuru, and Uchida Ryōhei, with whom he also had ideological exchanges and received financial support. In addition, he received financial aid from businessmen such as Matsukata Kōjirō, , stock trader , and Umeya Shōkichi. One of his supporters during his stay in Japan was also the great-grandfather of manga artist .

Additionally, Sasaki Tōichi of the Imperial Japanese Army served as a military advisor to Sun. He also became friends with Minakata Kumagusu, and their friendship deepened after they met while Sun was in exile in London.

=== Great Asianism Lecture ===
The Great Asianism Lecture refers to the speech given by Sun Yat-sen on November 29, 1924, the day after his meeting with Tōyama Mitsuru in Kobe. It was delivered at the auditorium of the Kobe Prefectural Girls&#x27; High School, located where the current Hyogo Prefectural Government Office is, to five organizations, including the Kobe Chamber of Commerce. This speech distinguished between the &quot;kingly way&quot; of the East and the &quot;hegemonic way&quot; of the West, praising the kingly way of the East, and condemning Japan&#x27;s tilt towards hegemonic ways due to excess, while also praising Japan&#x27;s modernization as a leader in this regard.

:You Japanese people have adopted the hegemonic cultural ways of the West, while also possessing the essence of the kingly way of Asian culture. However, as you look toward the future of world culture, the question remains: will you ultimately become the tools of the Western hegemonic ways, or will you stand as a barrier to the Eastern kingly way? This depends on your careful consideration and deliberate choices.

This speech criticized Western colonialism while praising Japan&#x27;s modernization and civilization. It also criticized Japan for becoming a follower of Western colonialism and advocated for cooperation among Asians.

== Family ==


Sun Yat-sen was born to Sun Dacheng () and his wife, Lady Yang () on 12 November 1866. At the time, his father was 53, and his mother was 38 years old. He had an older brother, Sun Dezhang (), and an older sister, Sun Jinxing (), who died at the early age of 4. Another older brother, Sun Deyou (), died at the age of 6. He also had an older sister, Sun Miaoqian (), and a younger sister, Sun Qiuqi ().

At age 20, Sun had an arranged marriage with the fellow villager Lu Muzhen. She bore a son, Sun Fo, and two daughters, Sun Jinyuan () and Sun Jinwan (). Sun Fo was the grandfather of Leland Sun, who spent 37 years working in Hollywood as an actor and stuntman. Sun Yat-sen was also the godfather of Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger, an American author and poet who wrote under the name Cordwainer Smith.

Sun&#x27;s first concubine, the Hong Kong-born Chen Cuifen, lived in Taiping, Perak (now in Malaysia) for 17 years. The couple adopted a local girl as their daughter. Cuifen subsequently relocated to China, where she died.

During Sun&#x27;s exile in Japan, he had relationships with two Japanese women: the 15-year-old Haru Asada, whom he took as a concubine up to her death in 1902, and another 15-year-old schoolgirl, Kaoru Otsuki, whom Sun married in 1905 and abandoned the next year while she was pregnant. Otsuki later had their daughter, Fumiko, adopted by the Miyagawa family in Yokohama, who did not discover her parentage until 1951, 26 years after Sun&#x27;s death.

On 25 October 1915 in Japan, Sun married Soong Ching-ling, one of the Soong sisters. Soong Ching-ling&#x27;s father was the American-educated Methodist minister Charles Soong, who made a fortune in banking and in printing of Bibles. Although Charles had been a personal friend of Sun, he was enraged by Sun announcing his intention to marry Ching-ling because while Sun was a Christian, he kept two wives: Lu Muzhen and Kaoru Otsuki. Soong viewed Sun&#x27;s actions as running directly against their shared religion.

Soong Ching-Ling&#x27;s sister, Soong Mei-ling, later married Chiang Kai-shek.

== Cultural references ==
=== Memorials and structures in Asia ===

In most major Chinese cities, one of the main streets is Zhongshan Lu () to celebrate Sun&#x27;s memory. There are also numerous parks, schools, and geographical features named after him. Xiangshan, Sun&#x27;s hometown in Guangdong, was renamed Zhongshan in his honor, and there is a hall dedicated to his memory at the Temple of Azure Clouds in Beijing. There are also a series of Sun Yat-sen stamps.

Other references to Sun include the Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou and National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung. Other structures include Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall subway station, Sun Yat-sen house in Nanjing, Dr Sun Yat-sen Museum in Hong Kong, Chung-Shan Building, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Guangzhou, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Taipei and Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall in Singapore.

In Russia, a village in Mikhaylovsky District of Primorsky Krai was named Sunyatsenskoe in honor of him. There are streets named after him in Astrakhan, Ufa and Aldan. There was a street that was named after Sun in the Russian city of Omsk until 2005, when it was renamed in honor of the recipient of the title Hero of Soviet Union Mikhail Ivanovich Leonov.

In George Town, Penang, Malaysia, the Penang Philomatic Union had its premises at 120 Armenian Street in 1910, while Sun spent more than four months in Penang and convened the historic &quot;Penang Conference&quot; to launch the fundraising campaign for the Huanghuagang Uprising and founded the &quot;Kwong Wah Yit Poh&quot;. The house, which has been preserved as the Sun Yat-sen Museum (formerly called the Sun Yat Sen Penang Base), was visited by President-designate Hu Jintao in 2002. The Penang Philomatic Union subsequently moved to a bungalow at 65 Macalister Road, which has been preserved as the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Centre Penang.

As a dedication, the 1966 Chinese Cultural Renaissance was launched on Sun&#x27;s birthday on 12 November.

<text>The Pulitzer Prize for Biography is one of the seven American Pulitzer Prizes annually awarded for Letters, Drama, and Music. The award honors &quot;a distinguished and appropriately documented biography by an American author.&quot; Award winners received $15,000 USD.

From 1917 to 2022, this prize was known as the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography and was awarded to a distinguished biography, autobiography or memoir by an American author or co-authors, published during the preceding calendar year. Thus it is one of the original Pulitzers, for the program was inaugurated in 1917 with seven prizes, four of which were awarded that year.

==Recipients==
In its first 97 years to 2013, the Biography Pulitzer was awarded 97 times. Two were given in 1938, and none in 1962.

=== 1910s-1940s ===
=== 1950s-1970s ===

=== 1980s ===
Entries from this point on include the finalists listed after the winner for each year.

<doc id="88487" wikidata="Q3442" url="?curid=88487" title="Oscar (fish)">
<text>The oscar (Astronotus ocellatus) is a species of fish from the cichlid family known under a variety of common names, including tiger oscar, velvet cichlid, and marble cichlid. In tropical South America, where the species naturally resides, &quot;A. ocellatus&quot; specimens are often found for sale as a food fish in the local markets. The fish has been introduced to other areas, including India, China, Australia, and the United States. It is considered a popular aquarium fish in Europe and the U.S.

==Taxonomy==
The species was originally described by Louis Agassiz in 1831 as &quot;Lobotes ocellatus&quot;, as he mistakenly believed the species was marine; later work assigned the species to the genus &quot;Astronotus&quot;. The species also has a number of junior synonyms: &quot;Acara compressus&quot;, &quot;Acara hyposticta&quot;, &quot;Astronotus ocellatus zebra&quot;, and &quot;Astronotus orbiculatus&quot;.
==Description==

&quot;A. ocellatus&quot; examples have been reported to grow to about in length and in weight. The wild-caught forms of the species are typically darkly coloured with yellow-ringed spots or ocelli on the caudal peduncle and on the dorsal fin. These ocelli have been suggested to function to limit fin-nipping by piranha (&quot;Serrasalmus&quot; spp.), which co-occur with &quot;A. ocellatus&quot; in its natural environment. The species is also able to rapidly alter its colouration, a trait which facilitates ritualised territorial and combat behaviours amongst conspecifics. Juvenile oscars have a different colouration from adults, and are striped with white and orange wavy bands and have spotted heads.

==Distribution and habitat==

&quot;A. ocellatus&quot; is native to Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, French Guiana, Suriname, Peru, and Venezuela, and occurs in the Amazon River basin, along the Amazon, Içá, Negro, Solimões, and Ucayali River systems, and also in the Approuague and Oyapock River drainages. In its natural environment, the species typically occurs in slow-moving white-water habitats, and has been observed sheltering under submerged branches. Feral populations also occur in China, northern Australia, and Florida, USA as a byproduct of the ornamental fish trade. The species is limited in its distribution by its intolerance of cooler water temperatures, the lower lethal limit for the species is 12.9 °C (55.22 °F).

==Reproduction==
Although the species is widely regarded as sexually monomorphic, males have been suggested to grow more quickly, and in some naturally occurring strains, males are noted to possess dark blotches on the base of their dorsal fins. The species reaches sexual maturity around one year of age, and continues to reproduce for 9–10 years. Frequency and timing of spawning may be related to the occurrence of rain. &quot;A. ocellatus&quot; fish are biparental substrate spawners, though detailed information regarding their reproduction in the wild is scarce.

In captivity, pairs are known to select and clean generally flattened horizontal or vertical surfaces on which to lay their eggs.. Smaller females lay around 300–500 eggs, while larger female oscars can lay about 2,500-3,000 eggs. Like most cichlids, &quot;A. ocellatus&quot; practices brood care, although the duration of brood care in the wild remains unknown.

==In the aquarium==

Oscar fish can live in the aquarium with almost any type of fish around the same size as it gets, for example any type of cichlids and predatory fish. 

===Food===
Oscar fish are omnivores.
Most fish eaten by &quot;A. ocellatus&quot; in the wild are relatively sedentary catfish, including &quot;Bunocephalus&quot;, &quot;Rineloricaria&quot;, and &quot;Ochmacanthus&quot; species. The species uses a suction mechanism to capture prey, and has been reported to exhibit &quot;lying-on-side&quot; death mimicry in a similar fashion to &quot;Parachromis friedrichsthalii&quot; and &quot;Nimbochromis livingstonii&quot;. Wild oscars also consume shrimp, snails, insects and insect larvae, as well as fruits and nuts on a seasonal basis. The species also has an absolute requirement for vitamin C, and develops health problems in its absence. Captive oscars generally eat fish food designed for large carnivorous fish: crayfish, worms, and insects (such as flies, crickets and grasshoppers).

===Territorial behavior===

Oscars will often lay claim to an area of the aquarium and will be very aggressive towards other fish encroaching on their newly established territory inside the aquarium or lake. The size of the territory varies depending on the size and aggressiveness of the fish, and its surroundings. Once the oscar establishes a territory, it will vigorously defend it by chasing away other fish.

===Varieties===

A number of ornamental varieties of &quot;A. ocellatus&quot; have been developed for the aquarium industry. These include forms with greater intensity and quantities of red marbling across the body, albino, leucistic, and xanthistic forms. &quot;A. ocellatus&quot; with marbled patches of red pigmentation are sold as red tiger oscars, while those strains with the mainly red colouration of the flanks are frequently sold under the trade name of red oscars. The patterning of red pigment differs between individuals. In recent years long-finned varieties have also been developed. The species is also occasionally artificially coloured by a process known as painting.

<text>John Curtis Holmes ( Estes; August 8, 1944 – March 13, 1988), better known as John C. Holmes or Johnny Wadd (after the lead character he portrayed in a series of related films), was an American pornographic film actor. He ranks among the most prolific adult film performers, with documented credits for at least 573 films.

Holmes was best known for his exceptionally large penis, which was heavily promoted for its length, hardness, thickness, and staying power. However no documented measurement of Holmes&#x27; actual penis length, girth, tumescence, sexual stamina, or ejaculate volume has ever been confirmed.

Near the end of his life, Holmes attained notoriety for his reputed involvement in the Wonderland murders of July 1981 and eventually for his death from complications caused by AIDS in March 1988. He was the subject of several books, a lengthy essay in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and two feature-length documentaries, and was the inspiration for two Hollywood movies (&quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and &quot;Wonderland&quot;).

== Early life ==
John Holmes was born John Curtis Estes on August 8, 1944, in the small rural town of Ashville, Ohio, about south of Columbus. He was the youngest of four children born to 26-year-old Mary June ( Barton) Holmes, but the name of his father, railroad worker Carl Estes, was left blank on his birth certificate. Mary had married Edgar Harvey Holmes, who was the father of her three older children Dale, Edward and Anne. She and Edgar were married and divorced three times, as is documented by wedding certificates dated April 13, 1936; August 13, 1945; and September 12, 1947. At the time of their first marriage in 1936, Edgar was 35 years old and divorced, while Mary was aged 17. After divorcing for the third and final time, Edgar and Mary each got married one more time.

Mary changed John&#x27;s surname from Estes to Holmes when he was a child. In 1986, when Holmes applied for a passport for the first time prior to a trip to Italy, his mother reportedly provided him with the handwritten copy of his original birth certificate, which led Holmes to learn that his biological father was Carl Estes.

Holmes&#x27; mother was said to be a devout Southern Baptist and with her children regularly attended church in Millport, Ohio. By contrast, his stepfather Edgar was an alcoholic who would come home inebriated, stumble about the house and even vomit on the children. As a child, Holmes enjoyed a reprieve from his turbulent home life when he visited his maternal grandparents, John W. and Bessie (née Gillenwater) Barton. Mary divorced Edgar when Holmes was a toddler and moved with her children to Columbus, where they lived in a low-income housing project with a friend of Mary&#x27;s and her own two children. The two women worked as clerks and waitresses in order to support their children.

On December 31, 1951, when Holmes was aged 7, his mother married Harold Bowman. Shortly afterward, Holmes and his family moved to the small town of Pataskala, Ohio, about seventeen miles east of Columbus. Holmes recalled that Bowman was a good father until his younger half-brother David was born, at which point Bowman reportedly lost interest in his stepchildren and began neglecting them.

Holmes left home at age 15 and enlisted in the United States Army, with his mother&#x27;s written permission. He spent most of the three years of his military service in West Germany in the Signal Corps. Upon his honorable discharge in 1963, Holmes moved to Los Angeles, California, where he worked in a variety of jobs, including selling goods door-to-door and tending the vats at a Coffee Nips factory. During his stint as an ambulance driver, Holmes met a nurse named Sharon Gebenini in December 1964. They married on August 21, 1965, in Fort Ord, California, after Holmes turned 21.

In April 1965, Holmes found work as a forklift driver at a meatpacking warehouse in Cudahy. However, repeated exposure to the freezing air in the large walk-in freezer after being outside inhaling the desert-hot air caused him severe health problems, leading to a collapsed lung on three separate occasions during the two years he worked there. Sharon also had health problems, as during the first seventeen months of her marriage to Holmes, she miscarried three times.

== Career ==
=== Film career ===
Holmes began his pornographic movie career in the late 1960s while he was unemployed and recovering from his collapsed lung. He frequented a men&#x27;s card playing club in Gardena where on one evening, he allegedly met a photographer while standing next to him at a restroom urinal who gave Holmes his business card, telling him that he could find work in the underground adult film business. From 1969, Holmes did nude modeling for underground adult magazines as well as occasional stag films.

In 1971, Holmes&#x27; career began to take off with an adult film series built around a private investigator named Johnny Wadd, written and directed by Bob Chinn. The success of the film &quot;Johnny Wadd&quot; created an immediate demand for follow-ups, so Chinn followed up the same year with &quot;Flesh of the Lotus.&quot; Most of the subsequent Johnny Wadd films were written and directed by Chinn and produced by the Los Angeles-based company Freeway Films.

With the success of &quot;Deep Throat&quot; (1972), &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot; (1973), porn became chic even though its legality was still hotly contested. Holmes was arrested during this time for pimping and pandering, but he avoided prison time by reputedly becoming an informant for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). Holmes&#x27; &quot;handler&quot; during his time as an informant was LAPD vice detective Thomas Blake. Of his involvement with Holmes, Blake said, &quot;It was a pleasure working for him.&quot;

By the late 1970s, Holmes was reputed to be earning as much as $3,000 per day as a porn performer. Around this time, his consumption of cocaine and freebasing were becoming an increasingly serious problem. Professionally, it affected his ability to maintain an erection. To support himself and his drug habit, Holmes ventured into crime, selling drugs for gangs, prostituting himself to both men and women, as well as committing credit card fraud and various acts of petty theft. In 1976, Holmes met 15-year-old Dawn Schiller, whom Schiller later claimed he groomed, abused and forced into prostitution to support his drug habit.

=== Number and gender of partners ===
In the 1981 biographical feature documentary &quot;Exhausted: John C. Holmes, The Real Story&quot;, from director and Holmes confidante Julia St. Vincent, Holmes stated during an interview segment that he had had intercourse with over 14,000 women. The number had in fact been invented by Holmes on the spur of the moment to help salvage his waning image. The true number of women (and men) with whom Holmes had sex during his career would never be known. After his death, his ex-wife Sharon came across a footlocker, plated in 24k gold leaf, which contained photographic references to Holmes&#x27; &quot;private work&quot; and which she burned. Holmes&#x27; performances included at least one homosexual feature film, &quot;The Private Pleasures of John C. Holmes&quot; which was filmed in 1983.

=== Drugs and the Wonderland murders ===

In late 1980, a mutual friend introduced Holmes to Chris Coxx, who owned the Odyssey nightclub. In turn, Coxx introduced Holmes to Eddie Nash, a drug dealer who owned several nightclubs, including the Starwood in West Hollywood. At the same time, Holmes was closely associated with the Wonderland Gang, a group of heroin-addicted cocaine dealers, so called for the rowhouse located on Wonderland Avenue in the Laurel Canyon neighborhood of Los Angeles, out of which they operated. Holmes frequently sold drugs for the gang. Gang members included Ronnie Lee Launius, David Clay Lind and their &quot;wheelman&quot; Tracy McCourt.

After using more than his share of the Wonderland Gang&#x27;s drugs, Holmes found himself falling out of their favor. In June 1981, he told Launius and Lind about a large stash of drugs, money and jewelry Nash had in his house. Holmes helped to set up a home invasion and armed robbery committed on the morning of June 29. Although Holmes was not present during the robbery, Nash apparently suspected he had a part in it. After forcing Holmes to confess to his participation and threatening his life and those of his family, Nash dispatched enforcers, accompanied by Holmes, to exact revenge against the Wonderland Gang.

In the early hours of July 1, 1981, four of the gang&#x27;s members were found murdered and a fifth severely beaten in the Wonderland Avenue rowhouse. Holmes was allegedly present during the murders and left a palm print (not &quot;bloody&quot; as Los Angeles media outlets covering the story erroneously reported) over one victim&#x27;s headboard, but it is unclear whether he participated in the killings. Holmes was questioned but was released due to lack of evidence; he refused to cooperate with the investigation. After spending nearly five months on the run with Schiller, Holmes was arrested in Florida on December 4, 1981, by former LAPD homicide detectives Frank Tomlinson and Tom Lange (the latter of whom later gained fame for his role in the O. J. Simpson murder case). Holmes was extradited to Los Angeles, and in March 1982 was charged with personally committing all four murders. After a three-week trial, Holmes was acquitted on all charges except committing contempt of court on June 26, 1982. The murder trial was a landmark in the history of American trial procedure, as it was the first in which videotape was introduced as evidence.

== Penis size ==
Holmes&#x27; signature asset in the adult film business was his exceptionally large penis. No definitive measurement or documentation verifying his penis&#x27; length or girth exists, leaving its exact size unknown. Holmes was not circumsized.

Veteran porn actress Dorothiea &quot;Seka&quot; Patton has said that Holmes&#x27; penis was the biggest in the industry. In the documentary film &quot;Exhausted&quot;, she described oral sex with Holmes as similar to fellating a telephone pole. Holmes&#x27; first wife recalled his claiming to be when he first measured himself in her presence. On another occasion, Holmes claimed his penis was long and in circumference. Holmes&#x27; long-time friend and industry associate, Bill Amerson, said, &quot;I saw John measure himself several times; it was thirteen-and-a-half inches [34.3 cm]. The head was the size of an apple.&quot; In contrast, medical studies of human penis size have consistently found erections average between about five and six inches, with fewer than 0.2% of penises or more.

So celebrated was the size of Holmes&#x27; penis that it was used as a promotional tool for films in which he did not even appear. The film &quot;Anyone But My Husband&quot; ran a promotional tag line of: &quot;Tony &#x27;The Hook&#x27; Perez has a dick so big he gives John Holmes a run for his money.&quot; At the height of his career, Holmes had his penis insured by Lloyd&#x27;s of London for US$14 million. Holmes reveled in claiming he was insured &quot;for $1 million an inch&quot;.

Another controversy was regarding whether Holmes ever achieved a full erection, although much of his early work clearly revealed he was able to achieve a substantial erection. A popular joke in the 1970s porn industry held that Holmes was incapable of achieving a full erection because the blood flow from his head into his penis would cause him to pass out. Fellow film actress Annette Haven stated that his penis was never particularly hard during intercourse, likening it to &quot;doing it with a big, soft kind-of loofah&quot;.

After Holmes&#x27; death, the length of his penis continued to be used to market Holmes-related material. For example, at the premiere of the film &quot;Wonderland&quot; (2003), patrons were given 13-inch rulers as gag gifts. When Los Angeles-based S&amp;M Bikes debuted its first extra-long bicycle frame for BMX racing in 1989, the new model was dubbed the &quot;Holmes&quot; as a tribute to the actor.

== Personal life ==
On August 22, 1965, Holmes married a young nurse named Sharon Ann Gebenini at Fort Ord, California. Their divorce was finalized on October 19, 1984. She died on October 28, 2012.

In 1975, Holmes met Julia St. Vincent on the set of his film, &quot;Liquid Lips&quot;, which was being produced by her uncle Armand Atamian. Holmes and St. Vincent remained close until the Wonderland murders in 1981. St. Vincent produced the ersatz biographical film of Holmes&#x27; life, &quot;Exhausted&quot; (1981).

In 1976, Holmes started grooming and sexually abusing a 15 year old girl, Dawn Schiller. Holmes got Dawn addicted to drugs, physically and sexually abused her and trafficked her out to support his own drug addiction. In her memoir, &quot;The Road Through Wonderland: Surviving John Holmes&quot; (2009), Schiller also made the assertion that she and her sister Terry believed Holmes was a voyeur who looked through their bungalow windows in Glendale, as well as strangers&#x27; hotel windows at the Biltmore in Palm Springs.

In 1982, Holmes met his second wife Laurie Rose; they married in January 1987, which made Holmes stepfather to Rose&#x27;s young son.

== Later life and death ==
===Relationships===
After his release from Los Angeles County Jail for contempt of court in November 1982, Holmes quickly resumed his film career with a new generation of porn stars. His drug addiction continued off-and-on, and although work was still plentiful, it was no longer as lucrative as it had been with the advent of cheaply made videotapes that saturated the porn market. Most of the adult films and videos he made during the 1980s were little more than cameo appearances.

In February 1986, five or six months after initially testing negative, Holmes was diagnosed as HIV-positive. According to his second wife, Holmes claimed that he never used hypodermic needles and that he was deathly afraid of them. Both his first wife and friend Bill Amerson separately confirmed later that Holmes could not have contracted HIV from intravenous drug use as he never used needles.

During the summer of 1986, Holmes was offered a lucrative deal from Paradise Visuals, who were unaware he was HIV-positive, to travel to Italy to film what were to be his last two pornographic films. Holmes&#x27; penultimate film was &quot;The Rise of the Roman Empress&quot; (originally released in Italy as &quot;Carne bollente&quot;) for director Riccardo Schicchi. The film starred Holmes, the later Italian Parliament member Ilona &quot;Cicciolina&quot; Staller, Tracey Adams, Christoph Clark and Amber Lynn. His final film was &quot;The Devil In Mr. Holmes&quot;, starring Adams, Lynn, Karin Schubert and Marina Hedman. These last films created a furor when it was revealed later that Holmes had deliberately concealed his HIV status to his co-stars before engaging in unprotected sex for the production. Not wanting to reveal the true nature of his failing health, Holmes claimed to the press that he was suffering from colon cancer.

Holmes married Laurie Rose on January 23, 1987, in Las Vegas, Nevada, after confiding to her that he had AIDS. During the last five months of his life, from November 1987 to March 1988, Holmes received treatment and stayed at the VA hospital on Plummer Street in Sepulveda. On March 13, 1988, at age 43, Holmes died from AIDS-related complications, which, per his death certificate, were described as cardiorespiratory arrest and encephalitis due to AIDS, associated with lymphadenopathy and esophageal candidiasis. Holmes&#x27; body was cremated, and his widow Laurie and mother Mary scattered his ashes at sea off the coast of Oxnard, California.

=== Hobbies ===
Holmes enjoyed clay sculpting, woodworking and outdoor activities such as visiting beaches, camping, fishing and hiking.

== Business activities and endeavors ==
In 1979, along with his younger half-brother David Bowman, Holmes opened a Los Angeles locksmith shop managed by Bowman and an attached used goods store called The Just Looking Emporium, named by Gebinini and managed by Schiller. However, because of Holmes&#x27; escalating drug addiction, which distracted him from buying inventory for the Emporium and siphoned its working capital, the Emporium &quot;close[d] its doors forever by the end of September 1980&quot;. According to Schiller, &quot;David [kept] his part of the business open while John remove[d] our inventory and [sold] it all for coke.&quot;

Later, after Holmes&#x27; acquittal, he and Amerson founded and operated Penguin Productions, where Holmes could be a triple-threat: writing, directing and performing. Holmes appeared in seven of Penguin&#x27;s twenty productions between 1985 and 1988. After requesting permission to use the name &quot;Johnny Wadd&quot; from his old director and friend Bob Chinn, Holmes reprised the role for Penguin&#x27;s &quot;The Return of Johnny Wadd&quot; (1986) – one of his last films.

== Holmes mythology ==
Holmes&#x27; career was promoted with a series of claims that he made over the years (many made up on the spur of the moment by Holmes himself). The most dubious ones include:
* Holmes had degrees in physical therapy, medicine, and political science from UCLA. Holmes was in fact a high school dropout who never returned to school and, according to Bill Amerson, &quot;the closest John ever got to UCLA was breaking into cars in the school&#x27;s parking lot&quot;.
* Holmes&#x27; penis was so big that he had to stop wearing underwear because: &quot;I was getting erections and snapping the elastic waist band four or five times a month&quot;.
* During the filming of a gay feature film, Holmes inadvertently killed two male performers and was tried for manslaughter. The judge in the case sentenced Holmes to abstain from performing anal sex in any future films. However, this is likely an urban myth.
* Holmes and Ken Osmond, who played Eddie Haskell in the TV series &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, were the same person. In reality, the two men simply shared a passing resemblance.

<text>Jack Leonard Warner (born Jacob Warner; August 2, 1892 – September 9, 1978) was a Canadian-born American film executive, who was the president and driving force behind the Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. Warner&#x27;s career spanned over 55 years, surpassing that of any other of the pioneering Hollywood studio moguls.

As co-head of production at Warner Bros. Studios, Warner worked with his brother, Sam Warner, to procure the technology for the film industry&#x27;s first talking picture, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1927). After Sam&#x27;s death, Jack clashed with his surviving older brothers, Harry and Albert Warner. He assumed exclusive control of the company in the 1950s when he secretly purchased his brothers&#x27;s shares in the business after convincing them to participate in a joint sale of stocks.

Although Warner was feared by many of his employees and inspired ridicule with his uneven attempts at humor, he earned respect for his shrewd instincts and tough-mindedness. He recruited many of Warner Bros.&#x27; top stars and promoted the hard-edged social dramas for which the studio became known. Given to decisiveness, Warner once commented, &quot;If I&#x27;m right fifty-one percent of the time, I&#x27;m ahead of the game.&quot;

Throughout his career, Warner was viewed as a contradictory and enigmatic figure. Although he was a staunch Republican, he encouraged film projects that promoted the policies of Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He also opposed European fascism and criticized Nazi Germany well before America&#x27;s involvement in World War II. An opponent of communism, after the war Warner appeared as a friendly witness before the House Un-American Activities Committee, voluntarily naming screenwriters who had been fired at the time as suspected communists or sympathizers. Despite his controversial public image, Warner remained a force in the motion picture industry until his retirement in the early 1970s.

==Early years==
Jacob Warner (as he was named at birth) was born in London, Ontario, Canada, on August 2, 1892. His parents were Polish-Jewish immigrants from Congress Poland (then part of the Russian Empire), who spoke mainly Yiddish. He was the fifth surviving son of Benjamin Warner (originally &quot;Wonsal&quot; or &quot;Wonskolaser&quot;), a cobbler from Krasnosielc, and his wife, the former Pearl Leah Eichelbaum. Following their marriage in 1876, the couple had three children in Poland, one of whom died at a young age; another was Jack&#x27;s eldest brother, Hirsch (later Harry).

In 1888 Benjamin made his way to Hamburg, Germany, and took ship for the United States. In New York City, Benjamin introduced himself as &quot;Benjamin Warner&quot;, and the surname &quot;Warner&quot; remained with him for the rest of his life. Pearl Warner and the couple&#x27;s two children joined him in Baltimore less than a year later. There the couple had five more children, including Abraham (later known as Albert) and Sam Warner.
In the early 1890s, Benjamin Warner decided to move to Canada, following a friend&#x27;s advice that he could make an excellent living bartering tin wares with trappers in exchange for furs. Sons Jack and David were born in Ontario. After two arduous years in Canada, the Warners returned to Baltimore, where two more children were born, Sadie and Milton. In 1896, they relocated to Youngstown, Ohio, following the lead of the eldest son Harry, who had established a shoe repair shop in the burgeoning steel town. Father and son worked in the repair shop until Benjamin secured a loan to open a downtown meat and grocery store.

Jack spent much of his youth in Youngstown, and wrote of his formative experiences there in his autobiography: &quot;J. Edgar Hoover told me that Youngstown in those days was one of the toughest cities in America, and a gathering place for Sicilian thugs active in the Mafia. There was a murder or two almost every Saturday night in our neighborhood, and knives and brass knuckles were standard equipment for the young hotheads on the prowl.&quot; Warner claimed that he briefly belonged to a street gang in Westlake&#x27;s Crossing, a notorious neighborhood west of downtown. Meanwhile, he received his first taste of show business, singing at local theaters and partnering with another aspiring song-and-dance man. During his brief career in vaudeville, he officially changed his name to Jack Leonard Warner. Jack&#x27;s older brother Sam disapproved of these youthful pursuits. &quot;Get out front where they pay the actors,&quot; he advised Jack. &quot;That&#x27;s where the money is.&quot;

==Professional career==
===Early business ventures===

In Youngstown, the Warner brothers took their first tentative steps into the entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, Sam formed a business partnership with another local resident and took over the city&#x27;s Old Grand Opera House as a venue for &quot;cheap vaudeville and photoplays&quot;. The venture failed after one summer. Sam then secured a job as a movie projectionist at Idora Park, a local amusement park. He convinced the family of the new medium&#x27;s possibilities, and purchased of a Model B Kinetoscope for $1000 from a projectionist &quot;down on his luck&quot;. Jack contributed $150 to the venture by pawning a horse.

The enterprising brothers screened a well-used copy of &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; throughout Ohio and Pennsylvania before renting a vacant store in New Castle, Pennsylvania. This makeshift theatre, called the Bijou, was furnished with chairs borrowed from a local undertaker. Jack, who was still living in Youngstown, arrived on weekends &quot;to sing illustrated song-slides during reel changes&quot;.

In 1906, the brothers purchased a small theater in New Castle, which they called the Cascade Movie Palace. In 1907, the Warner brothers established the Pittsburgh-based Duquesne Amusement Company, a distribution firm that proved lucrative until the advent of Thomas Edison&#x27;s Motion Picture Patents Company (also known as the Edison Trust), which charged distributors exorbitant fees. In 1909, Harry agreed to bring Jack into the family business, sending him to Norfolk, Virginia, where Jack assisted Sam in the operation of a second film exchange company. Later that year, the Warners sold their business to the General Film Company for &quot;$10,000 in cash, $12,000 in preferred stock, and payments over a four-year period, for a total of $52,000&quot; (equivalent to $ today).

===Formation of Warner Bros.===
The Warner brothers pooled their resources and moved into film production in 1910. In 1912, they supported filmmaker Carl Laemmle&#x27;s Independent Motion Picture Company, which challenged the monopoly of the Edison Trust. That same year, Jack acquired a job as a film splicer in New York, where he assisted Sam with the production of &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot;. Despite the film&#x27;s box office success, Harry still feared competition from the Edison Trust. He subsequently broke with Laemmle and sent Jack to establish a film exchange in San Francisco, while Sam did the same in Los Angeles. The brothers were soon poised to exploit the expanding California movie market.

In 1917, Jack was sent to Los Angeles to open another film exchange company. Their first opportunity to produce a major film came in 1918, when they purchased the film rights for &quot;My Four Years in Germany&quot;, a bestselling novel depicting German wartime atrocities, and the film adaptation became a commercial and critical success. The four brothers established a studio, with Jack and Sam as co-heads of production. As producers, the two solicited new scripts and story lines, secured film sets and equipment, and found ways to reduce production costs.
In 1919, the fledgling Warner Bros. Studios followed up the success of &quot;My Four Years in Germany&quot; with a popular serial titled &quot;The Tiger&#x27;s Claw&quot;. That same year, the studio was less successful in its efforts to promote &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;, a film on the dangers of venereal disease that featured Jack&#x27;s sole screen appearance. During this period, the studio earned few profits, in 1920 the Warners secured a bank loan to settle their business debts. Shortly thereafter, they relocated the film studio from Culver City, California, to Hollywood, where they purchased a lot on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Bronson Avenue, known today as Sunset Bronson Studios. The new location and upgraded facilities did not significantly improve the studio&#x27;s image, which remained defined by its low-budget comedies and racy films on declining morality.

In 1923, the studio discovered a trained German Shepherd named Rin Tin Tin. The canine made his debut in &quot;Where the North Begins&quot;, a film about an abandoned pup who is raised by wolves and befriends a fur trapper. According to one biographer, Jack&#x27;s initial doubts about the project were quelled when he met Rin Tin Tin, &quot;who seemed to display more intelligence than some of the Warner comics.&quot; Rin Tin Tin proved to be the studio&#x27;s most important commercial asset until the introduction of sound. Screenwriter Darryl F. Zanuck produced several scripts for Rin Tin Tin vehicles and, during one year, wrote more than half of the studio&#x27;s features. From 1928 to 1933, Zanuck served as Jack&#x27;s right-hand man and executive producer, with responsibilities including day-to-day production of films. Despite the success of Rin Tin Tin and other projects, Warner Bros. was still a poor cousin to Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;Big Three&quot; – Paramount, Universal, and First National studios.

In 1925, the studio expanded its operations and acquired the Brooklyn-based theater company Vitagraph. Later that year, Sam urged Harry to sign with Western Electric to develop a series of talking short films using the new Vitaphone technology.

Sam died of pneumonia in 1927, just before the premiere of the first feature-length talking picture, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, and Jack became sole head of production. Sam&#x27;s death left Jack inconsolable: &quot;Throughout his life, Jack had been warmed by Sam&#x27;s sunshiny optimism, his thirst for excitement, his inventive mind, his gambling nature. Sam had also served as a buffer between Jack and his stern eldest brother, Harry.&quot; Without his brother and co-producer, Jack ran the Warner Bros. Burbank studio with an iron hand, and became increasingly demanding and harsh with his employees.

As the family grieved over Sam&#x27;s sudden passing, the success of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; helped establish Warner Bros. as a major studio. From an investment of only $500,000 in the film, the studio reaped $3 million in profits. Hollywood&#x27;s other five major studios, which controlled most of the nation&#x27;s movie theaters, initially attempted to block the growth of &quot;talking pictures&quot;. In the teeth of this opposition, Warner Bros. produced twelve &quot;talkies&quot; in 1928 alone. The following year, the newly formed Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Warner Bros. for &quot;revolutionizing the industry with sound&quot;.

Despite Warner Bros.&#x27; new prosperity, Jack kept a tight rein on costs. He placed the studio&#x27;s directors on a quota system and decreed a flat, low-key lighting style to smooth out the defects of cheap film sets.

===Depression era===
The studio emerged relatively unscathed from the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and produced a broad range of films, including &quot;backstage musicals,&quot; &quot;crusading biopics,&quot; &quot;swashbucklers,&quot; and &quot;women&#x27;s pictures.&quot; As Thomas Schatz observed, this repertoire was &quot;a means of stabilizing marketing and sales, of bringing efficiency and economy into the production of some fifty feature films per year, and of distinguishing Warners&#x27; collective output from that of its competitors&quot;. Warner Bros. became best known, however, for its hard-hitting social dramas, whose production Jack tended to support. These included gangster classics such as &quot;Little Caesar&quot; and &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; as well as the critically acclaimed &quot;I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang&quot;, starring Paul Muni. Some of these films reflected a surprising (albeit temporary) shift in Jack&#x27;s political outlook. By 1932, despite his longstanding association with the Republican Party, he openly supported Democratic presidential candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt, staging a &quot;Motion Picture and Electrical Parade Sports Pageant&quot; at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Roosevelt&#x27;s honor. This development foreshadowed an &quot;era in which Warner would recruit the most New Deal-ish (often simultaneously the most left-wing) writers&quot;.
During this period, Jack took an active role in recruiting talent. To furnish Warner Bros. with much needed &quot;star power&quot;, he raided contract players from rival studios, in some cases offering to double their salaries. This strategy yielded three leading stars from Paramount – William Powell, Kay Francis, and Ruth Chatterton. In 1929, Jack persuaded British stage and screen actor George Arliss to play the title role in a remake of the 1921 United Artists film &quot;Disraeli&quot;, which turned out to be a box-office hit. Then, in 1930, he spotted future stars James Cagney, Joan Blondell, and Frank McHugh in the cast of a New York play called &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;. Although Cagney turned out to be Jack&#x27;s greatest prize, he was also the studio executive&#x27;s biggest professional headache. During their frequent arguments, Cagney would scream the Yiddish obscenities he learned as a boy in Yorkville, New York City. According to a 1937 &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine article, Jack&#x27;s most intense contract disputes involved Cagney, &quot;who got sick of being typed as a girl-hitting mick and of making five pictures a year instead of four.&quot;

Zanuck resigned during a contract dispute with Harry Warner in 1933. According to a 1933 letter that Jack wrote to Will H. Hays, then president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, Zanuck had demanded more pay and &quot;indicated his desire to raise the salaries of the actors and personnel in the motion pictures we were producing&quot;. That year, Zanuck established Twentieth Century Pictures, which merged with Fox Film Corporation in 1935. A longtime Warner Bros. producer, Hal B. Wallis, took over as executive producer. Jack, however, denied Wallis the sweeping powers enjoyed by Zanuck, and the result was a decentralization of creative and administrative control that often created confusion at the studio. Under the new system, each picture was assigned a supervisor usually plucked from the ranks of the studio&#x27;s screenwriters. Although Warner Bros. maintained a high rate of production throughout the 1930s, some pictures showed an uneven quality that reflected &quot;not only the difficulty of shifting to a supervisory system but also the consequences of dispersing authority into the creative ranks&quot;.

Meanwhile, Jack&#x27;s role in production became somewhat limited. After acquiring a creative property, he often had little to do with a film&#x27;s production until it was ready for preview. Nevertheless, he could be heavy-handed with employees and &quot;merciless in his firings.&quot; Film director Gottfried Reinhardt claimed that Jack &quot;derived pleasure&quot; from humiliating subordinates. &quot;Harry Cohn was a sonofabitch,&quot; Reinhardt said, &quot;but he did it for business; he was not a sadist. Mayer could be a monster, but he was not mean for the sake of meanness. Jack was.&quot;

Jack&#x27;s management style frustrated many studio employees. Comedian Jack Benny, who once worked at Warner Bros., quipped, &quot;Jack Warner would rather tell a bad joke than make a good movie&quot;. Jack frequently clashed with actors and supposedly banned them from the studio&#x27;s executive dining room, with the explanation, &quot;I don&#x27;t need to look at actors when I eat.&quot;
The studio executive did, however, win the affection of a few film personalities. Among these was Bette Davis, one of the studio&#x27;s leading stars, who once fled to England to secure release from her contract. In later years, Davis defended Jack against rumors of sexual impropriety when she wrote: &quot;No lecherous boss was he! His sins lay elsewhere. He was the father. The power. The glory. And he was in business to make money.&quot; Davis revealed that, after the birth of her child, Jack&#x27;s attitude toward her became warm and protective. &quot;We became father and child, no question about it.&quot; she said. &quot;He told me I didn&#x27;t have to come back to work until I really felt like it. He was a thoughtful man. Not many nice things were said about him.&quot; Warner also earned the gratitude and affection of Errol Flynn. In 1935, the studio head personally selected Flynn for the title role of &quot;Captain Blood&quot;, even though he was an unknown actor at the time. In 1936, following the success of another costume epic, &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, Jack tore up Flynn&#x27;s contract and signed him to a long-term deal that doubled his weekly salary.

===The prewar and war years===

As the 1930s came to an end, both Jack and Harry Warner became increasingly alarmed over the rise of Nazism. As Bernard F. Dick observed, the Warners, &quot;as sons of Polish Jews who fled their homeland because of antisemitic pogroms ... had a personal interest in exposing Nazism.&quot; Moreover, the attraction to films critical of German militarism had a long history with the Warners that predated their production of &quot;My Four Years in Germany&quot; in 1918. In 1917, while it was still in distribution, the Warners had secured the rights for &quot;War Brides&quot;, a movie that featured Alla Nazimova as &quot;a woman who kills herself rather than breed children for an unidentified country whose army looks suspiciously Teutonic.&quot; Beyond this, Jack was shaken by the 1936 murder of studio salesman Joe Kaufman, who was beaten to death by Nazi stormtroopers in Berlin. He later described the incident in the following terms: &quot;Like many an outnumbered Jew he was trapped in an alley. They [Nazi hoodlums] hit him with fists and clubs and then kicked the life out of him with their boots and left him dying there.&quot; Hence, while other Hollywood studios sidestepped the issue, fearing domestic criticism and the loss of European markets, Warner Bros. produced films that were openly critical of Nazi Germany.

In 1939, the studio released &quot;Confessions of a Nazi Spy&quot;, starring Edward G. Robinson. The project, which was recommended to Jack by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, drew on the real-life experiences of Agent Leon G. Turrou, who had worked as an undercover agent. Despite legal ramifications preventing the use of actual names, the studio aimed for an &quot;aura of authenticity&quot; and Wallis initially recommended eliminating credits to give the film &quot;the appearance of a newsreel.&quot; &quot;Confessions of a Nazi Spy&quot; was widely criticized. The critic Pare Lorentz wrote, &quot;The Warner brothers have declared war on Germany with this one.&quot; The German ambassador responded by issuing a protest to Secretary of State Cordell Hull, and the German dictator, Adolf Hitler, who watched the film at Berchtesgaden, was outraged. Meanwhile, the studio received stern warnings from U.S. Congressman Martin Dies Jr. about defaming a &quot;friendly country&quot;.

Initially, the studio bowed to pressure from the Roosevelt Administration, the Hays Office, and isolationist lawmakers to desist from similar projects. Jack announced that the studio would release no more &quot;propaganda pictures&quot; and promptly ordered the shelving of several projects with an anti-Nazi theme. In time, however, Warner Bros. produced more films with anti-Nazi messages, including &quot;Underground&quot; and &quot;All Through the Night&quot;. In 1940, the studio produced short films that dramatically documented the devastation wrought by the German bombing raids on London. Meanwhile, the studio celebrated the exploits of the Royal Canadian Air Force with films such as &quot;Captains of the Clouds&quot;. In 1941, Warner also produced the influential war film &quot;Sergeant York&quot;.

Contemporary reports that Jack had banned the use of the German language throughout the company&#x27;s studios were denied by studio representatives who indicated that this move would have prevented scores of studio employees from communicating with each other.

After the American declaration of war against the Axis Powers, Jack, like some other studio heads, was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Air Corps.

In 1943 the studio&#x27;s film &quot;Casablanca&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Picture. When the award was announced, Wallis got up to accept, only to find Jack had rushed onstage &quot;with a broad, flashing smile and a look of great self-satisfaction&quot; to take the trophy, Wallis later recalled. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t believe it was happening. &quot;Casablanca&quot; had been my creation; Jack had absolutely nothing to do with it. As the audience gasped, I tried to get out of the row of seats and into the aisle, but the entire Warner family sat blocking me. I had no alternative but to sit down again, humiliated and furious. ... Almost forty years later, I still haven&#x27;t recovered from the shock.&quot;

Also in 1943, Jack, at the advice of President Roosevelt, produced a film adaptation of the controversial book &quot;Mission to Moscow&quot;, a film intended to inspire public support of the uneasy military alliance between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Later, while testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) on October 27, 1947, Jack dismissed allegations during the Cold War that this film was subversive, and he argued that &quot;Mission to Moscow&quot; was produced &quot;only to help a desperate war effort, and not for posterity.&quot; After the film&#x27;s lackluster response under distribution, the Republican National Committee accused him of producing &quot;New Deal propaganda.&quot;

In line with the Warner brothers&#x27; early opposition to Nazism, Warner Bros. produced more pictures about the war than any other studio, covering every branch of the armed services. In addition, the studio produced patriotic musicals such as &quot;This Is the Army&quot; and &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;.

===Postwar era===
Warner responded grudgingly to the rising popularity of television in the late 1940s. Initially he tried to compete with the new medium, introducing gimmicks such as 3-D films, which soon lost their appeal among moviegoers. In 1954, Warner finally engaged the new medium, providing ABC with a weekly show, &quot;Warner Bros. Presents&quot;. The studio followed up with a series of Western dramas, such as &quot;Maverick&quot;, &quot;Bronco&quot;, and &quot;Colt .45&quot;. Accustomed to dealing with actors in a high-handed manner, within a few years Jack provoked hostility among emerging TV stars such as James Garner, who filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. over a contract dispute. Warner was angered by the perceived ingratitude of television actors, who evidently showed more independence than film actors, and this deepened his contempt for the new medium. Following his deal with ABC, Warner also made his son, Jack Jr., head of the company&#x27;s new television department.
During this period, Warner showed little foresight in his treatment of the studio&#x27;s cartoon operation. Animated characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig, while embraced by cartoon lovers, &quot;were always stepchildren at Warner Bros.&quot; As biographer Bob Thomas wrote, &quot;Jack Warner...considered cartoons no more than an extraneous service provided to exhibitors who wanted a full program for their customers.&quot; In 1953, during a rare meeting between the Warners and the studio&#x27;s cartoon makers, Jack confessed that he didn&#x27;t &quot;even know where the hell the cartoon studio is&quot;, and Harry added, &quot;The only thing I know is that we make Mickey Mouse,&quot; a reference to the flagship character of a competing company, Walt Disney Productions. Several years later, Jack sold all of the 400 cartoons Warner Bros. made before 1948 for $3,000 apiece. As Thomas noted, &quot;They have since earned millions, but not for Warner Bros.&quot;

Jack&#x27;s tumultuous relationship with his brother Harry worsened in February 1956, when Harry learned of Jack&#x27;s decision to sell Warner Bros.&#x27; pre-1950 films to Associated Artists Productions (soon to merge with United Artists Television) for the modest sum of $21 million. &quot;This is our heritage, what we worked all our lives to create, and now it is gone,&quot; Harry exclaimed, upon hearing of the deal. The breach between Jack and Harry widened later that year. In July 1956, Jack, Harry, and Albert announced that they were putting Warner Bros. on the market. Jack, however, secretly organized a syndicate that purchased control of the company. By the time Harry and Albert learned of their brother&#x27;s dealings, it was too late. Jack, as the company&#x27;s largest stockholder, appointed himself as the new company president. Shortly after the deal was closed, he announced that the company and its subsidiaries would be &quot;directed more vigorously to the acquisition of the most important story properties, talents, and to the production of the finest motion pictures possible&quot;.

The two brothers had often argued, and earlier in the decade, studio employees claimed they saw Harry chase Jack through the studio with a lead pipe, shouting, &quot;I&#x27;ll get you for this, you son of a bitch&quot; and threatening to kill him. This subterfuge, however, proved too much for Harry. He never spoke to Jack again. When Harry died on July 27, 1958, Jack did not attend the funeral, and he departed for his annual vacation at Cap d&#x27;Antibes. Asked to respond to his brother&#x27;s death, he said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t give a shit about Harry.&quot; At the same time, Jack took pride in the fact that President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent him a letter of condolence.

===The Sixties===
In the 1960s, Warner kept pace with rapid changes in the industry and played a key role in developing films that were commercial and critical successes. In February 1962, he purchased the film rights for the Broadway musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, paying an unprecedented $6.5 million. The previous owner, CBS director William S. Paley set terms that included fifty percent of the distributor&#x27;s gross profits &quot;plus ownership of the negative at the end of the contract.&quot; Despite the &quot;outrageous&quot; purchase price, and the ungenerous terms of the contract, the deal proved lucrative for Warner Bros., securing the studio $12 million in profits. Warner was criticized for choosing a non-singing star, Audrey Hepburn, to play the leading role of Eliza Doolittle; indeed, the 1964 Academy Award for Best Actress went to Julie Andrews, who had played Eliza in both the Broadway and London productions of the musical, for &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, while Hepburn wasn&#x27;t even nominated. However, the film won the Best Picture Oscar for 1964.

In 1965, Warner surprised many industry observers when he purchased the rights to &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, Edward Albee&#x27;s searing play about a destructive marriage. From the beginning, the project was beset by controversy. Ernest Lehman&#x27;s script, which was extremely faithful to Albee&#x27;s play, stretched the U.S. film industry&#x27;s Production Code to the limit. Jack Valenti, who had just assumed leadership of the Motion Picture Association of America, recalled that a meeting with Warner and studio aide Ben Kalmenson left him &quot;uneasy&quot;. &quot;I was uncomfortable with the thought that this was just the beginning of an unsettling new era in film, in which we would lurch from crisis to crisis without any suitable solution in sight,&quot; Valenti wrote. Meanwhile, Lehman and the film&#x27;s director, Mike Nichols, battled with studio executives and exhibitors who insisted that the film be shot in color rather than black and white. These controversies soon faded into the background while Warner challenged the validity of the Production Code by publicly requiring theaters showing the film to post an &quot;adults only&quot; label and restrict ticket sales accordingly, all as a marketing tease to entice audiences to see what warranted that restriction. At this, the MPAA — wary of a repeat of the embarrassment it had trying to censor the highly acclaimed film &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot; — gave in and approved the film as a special exception because of its quality, which led other filmmakers to challenge the Code themselves even more aggressively. Upon its release, &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; was embraced by audiences and critics alike. It secured thirteen nominations from the Academy, including one for Best Picture of 1966.

Despite these achievements, Warner grew weary of making films, and he sold a substantial amount of his studio stock to Seven Arts Productions on November 14, 1966. Some observers believed that Ben Kalmenson, Warner Bros.&#x27; executive vice president, persuaded Warner to sell his stock so that Kalmenson could assume leadership of the studio. Warner, however, had personal reasons for seeking retirement. His wife, Ann, continually pressured him to &quot;slow down&quot;, and the aging studio head felt a need to put his affairs in order. He sold his 1.6 million shares of studio stock shortly after producing the film adaptation of Lerner &amp; Loewe&#x27;s &quot;Camelot&quot;. The sale yielded, after capital gains taxes, about $24 million (equivalent to $ million today). Eight months after the sale, Warner quipped, &quot;Who would ever have thought that a butcher boy from Youngstown, Ohio, would end up with twenty-four million smackers in his pocket?&quot; At the time of the sale, he had earned the distinction of being the second production chief to also serve as company president, after Columbia Pictures&#x27; Harry Cohn.

Warner&#x27;s decision to sell came at a time when he was losing the formidable power that he once took for granted. He had already survived the dislocations of the 1950s, when other studio heads – including Mayer, David O. Selznick, and Samuel Goldwyn – were pushed out by stockholders who &quot;sought scapegoats for dwindling profits&quot;. Structural changes that occurred in the industry during this period ensured that studios would become &quot;more important as backers of independent producers than as creators of their own films&quot;, a situation that left little room for the traditional movie mogul. By the mid-1960s, most of the film moguls from the Golden Age of Hollywood had died, and Warner was regarded as one of the last of a dying breed. Evidence of his eroding control at Warner Bros. included his failure to block production of the controversial but highly influential film &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, a project he initially &quot;hated&quot;. Similarly, as producer of the film adaptation of &quot;Camelot&quot;, he was unable to persuade director Joshua Logan to cast Richard Burton and Julie Andrews in the leading roles. Instead, Logan selected Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave, a move that contributed to the project&#x27;s critical – and commercial – failure. Another factor was that Logan was able to manipulate Warner&#x27;s ego to persuade him from cutting the screenplay&#x27;s length, despite the fact that the studio executives had already agreed with the film&#x27;s unofficial producer, Joel Freeman, that it was overlong. Warner officially retired from the studio in 1969.

===After Warner Bros.===
Warner remained active as an independent producer until the early 1970s to run some of the company&#x27;s distributions and exhibition division. Among his last productions was a film adaptation of a Broadway musical, &quot;1776&quot;, which was released through Columbia Pictures. Before the film&#x27;s release, Warner showed a preview cut to President Richard Nixon, who recommended substantial changes, including the removal of the song &#x27;Cool, Cool, Considerate Men&#x27; that struck him as veiled criticisms of the ongoing Vietnam War. Without consulting the film&#x27;s director, Peter H. Hunt, Warner ordered the film re-edited. The cuts have since been restored in most television showings and in the film&#x27;s DVD release.

In November 1972, the film opened to enthusiastic audiences at Radio City Music Hall, but it fared poorly in theaters. Faced with a polarized political climate, few Americans were drawn to &quot;a cheery exercise in prerepublic civics&quot;. Warner&#x27;s efforts to promote the film were sometimes counterproductive; during an interview with talk show host Merv Griffin, the elderly producer engaged in a lengthy tirade against &quot;pinko communists&quot;. This would become his only television interview.

==Personal life==
On October 14, 1914, Warner married Irma Claire Salomon, the daughter of Sam Salomon and Bertha Franklin Salomon from one of San Francisco&#x27;s pioneer Jewish families. Irma gave birth to the couple&#x27;s only child, Jack M. Warner, on March 27, 1916. Jack Sr. named the child after himself, disregarding an Eastern European Jewish custom that children should not be named after living relatives. Although his son bore a different middle initial, he &quot;has been called Junior all his life&quot;.

Warner&#x27;s first marriage ended in 1935, when he left his wife for another woman, Ann Page, with whom he had a daughter named Barbara. (1934-2022) Irma sued her husband for divorce on the grounds of desertion. Harry Warner reflected the family&#x27;s feelings about the marriage when he exclaimed, &quot;Thank God our mother didn&#x27;t live to see this&quot;. Jack married Ann after the divorce. The Warners, who took Irma&#x27;s side in the affair, refused to accept Ann as a family member. In the wake of this falling out, Warner&#x27;s relationship with his son, Jack Jr., also became strained.

In the late 1950s, Warner was almost killed in a car accident that left him in a coma for several days. On August 5, 1958, after an evening of baccarat at the Palm Beach Casino in Cannes, his Alfa Romeo roadster swerved into the path of a coal truck on a stretch of road located near the seaside villa of Prince Aly Khan. Warner was thrown from the car, which burst into flames upon impact. Shortly after the accident, Jack Jr. joined other family members in France, where the unconscious studio head was hospitalized. In an interview with reporters, Jack Jr. suggested that his father was dying. Then, during a visit to his father&#x27;s hospital room, the young man offended Ann, whom he largely blamed for his parents&#x27; divorce. When Warner regained consciousness, he was enraged by reports of his son&#x27;s behavior and their &quot;tenuous&quot; relationship came to an end. On December 30, 1958, Jack Jr. was informed, by Jack Sr.&#x27;s lawyer Arnold Grant, that the elder Warner had released him from the company. When he attempted to report for work, studio guards denied him entry. The two men never achieved a reconciliation, and Jack Jr. is not mentioned in his father&#x27;s 1964 autobiography.

Warner made no pretense of faithfulness to his second wife, Ann, and kept a series of mistresses throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The most enduring of these &quot;girlfriends&quot; was an aspiring actress named Jacquelyn Park) (née Mary Scarborough),&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate/3006084&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj/1454705855&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;solzyatthemovies/jack-warner-tcm&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; who bore a &quot;startling&quot; resemblance to his second wife. The relationship was in its fourth year when Ann pressed her husband to terminate the affair. Park later tried to publish her memoirs describing the affair, but nothing materialized.

Although Ann did once have an affair with studio actor Eddie Albert in 1941, she was much more devoted to the marriage. In the 1960s, she insisted that, despite his reputation for ruthlessness, Warner had a softer side. In a note to author Dean Jennings, who assisted Jack on his 1964 autobiography, &quot;My First Hundred Years in Hollywood&quot;, Ann wrote: &quot;He is extremely sensitive, but there are few who know that because he covers it with a cloak.&quot;

In 1937, Warner bought a mansion in Beverly Hills that he would develop into the later named Jack Warner Estate. After his death in 1978, Ann, his widow, lived there until her death in 1990.

==Political views==
An &quot;ardent Republican&quot;, Warner nevertheless supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal in the early 1930s. Later in the decade, he made common cause with opponents of Nazi Germany. In 1947, however, he served as a &quot;friendly witness&quot; for the HUAC, thereby lending support to allegations of a &quot;Red&quot; infiltration of Hollywood. Warner felt that communists were responsible for the studio&#x27;s month-long strike that occurred in the fall of 1946, and on his own initiative he provided the names of a dozen screenwriters who were dismissed because of suspected communist sympathies, a move that effectively destroyed their careers. Former studio employees named by Warner included Alvah Bessie, Howard Koch, Ring Lardner Jr., John Howard Lawson, Albert Maltz, Robert Rossen, Dalton Trumbo, Clifford Odets, and Irwin Shaw. As one biographer observed, Warner &quot;was furious when Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Paul Henreid and John Huston joined other members of the stellar Committee for the First Amendment in a flight to Washington to preach against the threat to free expression&quot;. Lester D. Friedman noted that Warner&#x27;s response to the HUAC hearings was similar to other Jewish studio heads who &quot;feared that a blanket equation of Communists with Jews would destroy them and their industry&quot;.

Warner publicly supported Richard Nixon during the 1960 presidential election and paid for full-page ads in &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;to proclaim why Nixon should be elected&quot;. In the wake of Nixon&#x27;s loss to John F. Kennedy, however, the studio head made arrangements to attend a fundraiser at the Hollywood Palladium in honor of the president-elect. Several weeks later, Warner received a phone call from the new chief executive&#x27;s father, Joseph P. Kennedy, and within a short time, Warner Bros. purchased the film rights for Robert Donovan&#x27;s book, &quot;PT 109&quot;, a bestseller concerning John Kennedy&#x27;s exploits during World War II. &quot;I don&#x27;t think President Kennedy would object to my friendship with Dick Nixon,&quot; Warner said later. &quot;I would have voted for both of them if I could. You might think this is a form of fence-straddling, but I love everybody.&quot; In the late 1960s, he emerged as an outspoken proponent of the Vietnam War.

==Death and legacy==
By the end of 1973, those closest to Warner became aware of signs that he was becoming disoriented. Shortly after losing his way in the building that housed his office, Warner retired. In 1974, Warner suffered a stroke that left him blind and enfeebled. During the next several years, he gradually lost the ability to speak and became unresponsive to friends and relatives. Finally, on August 13, 1978, Warner was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Hospital, where he died of a heart inflammation (&quot;edema&quot;) on September 9. He was 86 years old. A funeral service was held at the Wilshire Boulevard Temple, the synagogue to which many members of the Warner family belonged. He was interred at Home of Peace Cemetery in East Los Angeles, California.

Warner left behind an estate estimated at $15 million. Much of the Warner estate, including property and memorabilia, was bequeathed to his widow, Ann. However, Warner also left $200,000 to his estranged son, Jack Jr., perhaps in an effort to discourage him from contesting the will. In the days following his death, newspaper obituaries recounted the familiar story of &quot;the four brothers who left the family butcher shop for nickelodeons&quot; and went on to revolutionize American cinema. A front-page story in Warner&#x27;s adopted hometown of Youngstown featured accounts of the family&#x27;s pre-Hollywood struggles in Ohio, describing how Warner drove a wagon for his father&#x27;s business when he was only seven years old. The late movie mogul was widely eulogized for his role in &quot;shaping Hollywood&#x27;s &#x27;Golden Age&#x27;&quot;.

Several months after Warner&#x27;s death, a more personal tribute was organized by the Friends of the Libraries at the University of Southern California. The event, called &quot;The Colonel: An Affectionate Remembrance of Jack L. Warner&quot;, drew Hollywood notables such as entertainers Olivia de Havilland and Debbie Reynolds, and cartoon voice actor Mel Blanc. Blanc closed the event with a rendition of Porky Pig&#x27;s famous farewell, &quot;A-bee-a-bee-a-bee–that&#x27;s all, folks.&quot; In recognition of his contributions to the motion picture industry, Warner was accorded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 6541 Hollywood Boulevard. He is also represented on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame (where he was inducted in 2004) in Toronto, which honours outstanding Canadians from all fields.

Warner is portrayed by Richard Dysart in &quot;Bogie&quot; (1980), Michael Lerner in &quot;This Year&#x27;s Blonde&quot; (1980), Jason Wingreen in &quot;Malice in Wonderland&quot; (1985), Mike Connors in &quot;James Dean: Race with Destiny&quot; (1997), Tim Woodward in &quot;RKO 281&quot; (1999), Len Kaserman in &quot;The Three Stooges&quot; (2000), Richard M. Davidson in &quot;Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows&quot; (2001), Mark Rydell in &quot;James Dean&quot; (2001), Danny Wells in &quot;Gleason&quot; (2002), Barry Langrishe in &quot;The Mystery of Natalie Wood&quot; (2004), Ben Kingsley in &quot;Life&quot; (2015), Stanley Tucci in &quot;Feud&quot; (2017) and Kevin Dillon in &quot;Reagan&quot; (2024).

<doc id="88493" wikidata="Q119546" url="?curid=88493" title="Howard Zinn">
<text>Howard Zinn (August 24, 1922January 27, 2010) was an American historian, playwright, philosopher, socialist intellectual and World War II veteran. He was chair of the history and social sciences department at Spelman College, and a political science professor at Boston University. Zinn wrote more than 20 books, including his best-selling and influential &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot; in 1980. In 2007, he published a version of it for younger readers, &quot;A Young People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot;.

Zinn described himself as &quot;something of an anarchist, something of a socialist. Maybe a democratic socialist.&quot; He wrote extensively about the civil rights movement, the anti-war movement and labor history of the United States. His memoir, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Be Neutral on a Moving Train&quot; (Beacon Press, 1994), was also the title of a 2004 documentary about Zinn&#x27;s life and work. Zinn died of a heart attack in 2010, at the age of 87.

==Early life==
Zinn was born to a Jewish immigrant family in Brooklyn, New York City, on August 24, 1922. His father, Eddie Zinn, born in Austria-Hungary, immigrated to the US with his brother Samuel before the outbreak of World War I. His mother, Jenny (Rabinowitz) Zinn, emigrated from the Eastern Siberian city of Irkutsk. His parents first became acquainted as workers at the same factory. During the Great Depression, his father worked as a ditch digger and window cleaner, and for a brief time, his parents ran a neighborhood candy store, barely earning a living. For many years, Zinn&#x27;s father was in the waiters&#x27; union and worked as a waiter for weddings and bar mitzvahs.

Both parents were factory workers with limited education when they met and married, and there were no books or magazines in the series of apartments where they raised their children. Zinn&#x27;s parents introduced him to literature by sending 10 cents plus a coupon to the &quot;New York Post&quot; for each of the 20 volumes of Charles Dickens&#x27; collected works. As a young man, Zinn made the acquaintance of several young Communists from his Brooklyn neighborhood. They invited him to a political rally being held in Times Square. Despite it being a peaceful rally, mounted police charged the marchers. Zinn was hit and knocked unconscious. This would have a profound effect on his political and social outlook.

Howard Zinn studied creative writing at Thomas Jefferson High School in a special program established by principal and poet Elias Lieberman.

Zinn initially opposed entry into World War II, influenced by his friends, by the results of the Nye Committee, and by his ongoing reading. However, these feelings shifted as he learned more about fascism and its rise in Europe. The book &quot;Sawdust Caesar&quot; had a particularly large impact through its depiction of Mussolini. After graduating from high school in 1940, Zinn took the Civil Service exam and became an apprentice shipfitter in the New York Navy Yard at the age of 18.

Concerns about low wages and hazardous working conditions compelled Zinn and several other apprentices to form the Apprentice Association. At the time, apprentices were excluded from trade unions and thus had little bargaining power, to which the Apprentice Association was their answer. The head organizers of the association, which included Zinn himself, would meet once a week outside of work to discuss strategy and read books that at the time were considered radical. Zinn was the Activities Director for the group. His time in this group would tremendously influence his political views and created for him an appreciation for unions.

===World War II===
Eager to fight fascism, Zinn joined the United States Army Air Corps during World War II and became an officer. He was assigned as a bombardier in the 490th Bombardment Group, bombing targets in Berlin, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. As bombardier, Zinn dropped napalm bombs in April 1945 on Royan, a seaside resort in western France. The anti-war stance Zinn developed later was informed, in part, by his experiences.

On a post-doctoral research mission nine years later, Zinn visited the resort near Bordeaux where he interviewed residents, reviewed municipal documents, and read wartime newspaper clippings at the local library. In 1966, Zinn returned to Royan after which he gave his fullest account of that research in his book, &quot;The Politics of History&quot;. On the ground, Zinn learned that the aerial bombing attacks in which he participated had killed more than a thousand French civilians as well as some German soldiers hiding near Royan to await the war&#x27;s end, events that are described &quot;in all accounts&quot; he found as &quot;une tragique erreur&quot; that leveled a small but ancient city and &quot;its population that was, at least officially, friend, not foe.&quot; In &quot;The Politics of History&quot;, Zinn described how the bombing was ordered—three weeks before the war in Europe ended—by military officials who were, in part, motivated more by the desire for their own career advancement than in legitimate military objectives. He quotes the official history of the US Army Air Forces&#x27; brief reference to the Eighth Air Force attack on Royan and also, in the same chapter, to the bombing of Plzeň in what was then Czechoslovakia. The official history stated that the Škoda Works in Plzeň &quot;received 500 well-placed tons&quot;, and that &quot;because of a warning sent out ahead of time the workers were able to escape, except for five persons. &quot;The Americans received a rapturous welcome when they liberated the city.

Zinn wrote:

I recalled flying on that mission, too, as deputy lead bombardier, and that we did not aim specifically at the &#x27;Skoda works&#x27; (which I would have noted, because it was the one target in Czechoslovakia I had read about) but dropped our bombs, without much precision, on the city of Pilsen. Two Czech citizens who lived in Pilsen at the time told me, recently, that several hundred people were killed in that raid (that is, Czechs)—not five.

Zinn said his experience as a wartime bombardier, combined with his research into the reasons for, and effects of the bombing of Royan and Pilsen, sensitized him to the ethical dilemmas faced by GIs during wartime. Zinn questioned the justifications for military operations that inflicted massive civilian casualties during the Allied bombing of cities such as Dresden, Royan, Tokyo, and Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II, Hanoi during the War in Vietnam, and Baghdad during the war in Iraq and the civilian casualties during bombings in Afghanistan during the war there. In his pamphlet, &quot;Hiroshima: Breaking the Silence&quot; written in 1995, he laid out the case against targeting civilians with aerial bombing.

Six years later, he wrote:

Recall that in the midst of the Gulf War, the US military bombed an air raid shelter, killing 400 to 500 men, women, and children who were huddled to escape bombs. The claim was that it was a military target, housing a communications center, but reporters going through the ruins immediately afterward said there was no sign of anything like that. I suggest that the history of bombing—and no one has bombed more than this nation—is a history of endless atrocities, all calmly explained by deceptive and deadly language like &quot;accident&quot;, &quot;military target&quot;, and &quot;collateral damage&quot;.

===Education===
After World War II, Zinn attended New York University on the GI Bill, graduating with a BA in 1951. At Columbia University, he earned an MA (1952) and a PhD in history with a minor in political science (1958). His master&#x27;s thesis examined the Colorado coal strikes of 1914. His doctoral dissertation &quot;Fiorello LaGuardia in Congress&quot; was a study of Fiorello La Guardia&#x27;s congressional career, and it depicted &quot;the conscience of the twenties&quot; as LaGuardia fought for public power, the right to strike, and the redistribution of wealth by taxation. &quot;His specific legislative program,&quot; Zinn wrote, &quot;was an astonishingly accurate preview of the New Deal.&quot; It was published by the Cornell University Press for the American Historical Association. &quot;Fiorello LaGuardia in Congress&quot; was nominated for the American Historical Association&#x27;s Beveridge Prize as the best English-language book on American history.

His professors at Columbia included Harry Carman, Henry Steele Commager, and David Donald. But it was Columbia historian Richard Hofstadter&#x27;s &quot;The American Political Tradition&quot; that made the most lasting impression. Zinn regularly included it in his lists of recommended readings, and, after Barack Obama was elected President of the United States, Zinn wrote, &quot;If Richard Hofstadter were adding to his book &quot;The American Political Tradition&quot;, in which he found both &#x27;conservative&#x27; and &#x27;liberal&#x27; Presidents, both Democrats and Republicans, maintaining for dear life the two critical characteristics of the American system, nationalism and capitalism, Obama would fit the pattern.&quot;

In 1960–61, Zinn was a post-doctoral fellow in East Asian Studies at Harvard University.

==Career==
===Academic career===
Zinn was professor of history at Spelman College in Atlanta from 1956 to 1963, and visiting professor at both the University of Paris and University of Bologna. At the end of the academic year in 1963, Zinn was fired from Spelman for insubordination. His dismissal came from Albert Manley, the first African-American president of that college, who felt Zinn was radicalizing Spelman students.

In 1964, he accepted a position at Boston University (BU), after writing two books and participating in the Civil Rights Movement in the South. His classes in civil liberties were among the most popular at the university with as many as 400 students subscribing each semester to the non-required class. A professor of political science, he taught at BU for 24 years and retired in 1988 at age 66.

&quot;He had a deep sense of fairness and justice for the underdog. But he always kept his sense of humor. He was a happy warrior,&quot; said Caryl Rivers, journalism professor at BU. Rivers and Zinn were among a group of faculty members who in 1979 defended the right of the school&#x27;s clerical workers to strike and were threatened with dismissal after refusing to cross a picket line.

Zinn came to believe that the point of view expressed in traditional history books was often limited. Biographer Martin Duberman noted that when he was asked directly if he was a Marxist, Zinn replied, &quot;Yes, I&#x27;m something of a Marxist.&quot; He especially was influenced by the liberating vision of the young Marx in overcoming alienation, and disliked what he perceived to be Marx&#x27;s later dogmatism. In later life he moved more toward anarchism.

He wrote a history text, &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot;, to provide other perspectives on American history. The book depicts the struggles of Native Americans against European and U.S. conquest and expansion, slaves against slavery, unionists and other workers against capitalists, women against patriarchy, and African-Americans for civil rights. The book was a finalist for the National Book Award in 1981.
In the years since the first publication of &quot;A People&#x27;s History&quot; in 1980, it has been used as an alternative to standard textbooks in many college history courses, and it is one of the most widely known examples of critical pedagogy. The &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; stated in 2006 that the book &quot;routinely sells more than 100,000 copies a year.&quot;

In 2004, Zinn published &quot;Voices of a People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot; with Anthony Arnove. &quot;Voices&quot; is a sourcebook of speeches, articles, essays, poetry and song lyrics by the people themselves whose stories are told in &quot;A People&#x27;s History.&quot;

In 2008, the Zinn Education Project was launched to support educators using &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot; as a source for middle and high school history. The project was started when William Holtzman, a former student of Zinn who wanted to bring Zinn&#x27;s lessons to students around the country, provided the financial backing to allow two other organizations, Rethinking Schools and Teaching for Change to coordinate the project. The project hosts a website with hundreds of free downloadable lesson plans to complement &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot;.

&quot;The People Speak&quot;, released in 2010, is a documentary movie based on &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot; and inspired by the lives of ordinary people who fought back against oppressive conditions over the course of the history of the United States. The film, narrated by Zinn, includes performances by Matt Damon, Morgan Freeman, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Eddie Vedder, Viggo Mortensen, Josh Brolin, Danny Glover, Marisa Tomei, Don Cheadle, and Sandra Oh.

===Civil rights movement===
From 1956 through 1963, Zinn chaired the Department of History and Social Sciences at Spelman College. He participated in the Civil Rights Movement and lobbied with historian August Meier &quot;to end the practice of the Southern Historical Association of holding meetings at segregated hotels.&quot;

While at Spelman, Zinn served as an adviser to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and wrote about sit-ins and other actions by SNCC for &quot;The Nation&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;. In 1964, Beacon Press published his book &quot;&quot;.

In 1964 Zinn, with the SNCC, began developing an educational program so that the 200 volunteer SNCC civil rights workers in the South, many of whom were college dropouts, could continue with their civil rights work and at the same time be involved in an educational system. Up until then many of the volunteers had been dropping out of school so they could continue their work with SNCC. Other volunteers had not spent much time in college. The program had been endorsed by the SNCC in December 1963 and was envisioned by Zinn as having a curriculum that ranged from novels to books about &quot;major currents&quot; in 20th-century world history, such as fascism, communism, and anti-colonial movements. This occurred while Zinn was in Boston.

Zinn also attended an assortment of SNCC meetings in 1964, traveling back and forth from Boston. One of those trips was to Hattiesburg, Mississippi, in January 1964 to participate in a SNCC voter registration drive. The local newspaper, the &quot;Hattiesburg American&quot;, described the SNCC volunteers in town for the voter registration drive as &quot;outside agitators&quot; and told local blacks &quot;to ignore whatever goes on, and interfere in no way...&quot; At a mass meeting held during the visit to Hattiesburg, Zinn and another SNCC representative, Ella Baker, emphasized the risks that went along with their efforts, a subject probably in their minds since a well-known civil rights activist, Medgar Evers, had been murdered getting out of his car in the driveway of his home in Jackson, Mississippi, only six months earlier. Evers had been the state field secretary for the NAACP.

Zinn was also involved in what became known as Freedom Summer in Mississippi in the summer of 1964. Freedom Summer involved bringing 1,000 college students to Mississippi to work for the summer in various roles as civil rights activists. Part of the program involved organizing &quot;Freedom Schools&quot;. Zinn&#x27;s involvement included helping to develop the curriculum for the Freedom Schools. He was also concerned that bringing 1,000 college students to Mississippi to work as civil rights activists could lead to violence and killings. As a consequence, Zinn recommended approaching Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett and President Lyndon Johnson to request protection for the young civil rights volunteers. Protection was not forthcoming. Planning for the summer went forward under the umbrella of the SNCC, the Congress of Racial Equality (&quot;CORE&quot;) and the Council of Federated Organizations (&quot;COFO&quot;).

On June 20, 1964, just as civil rights activists were beginning to arrive in Mississippi, CORE activists James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner were en route to investigate the burning of Mount Zion Methodist Church in Neshoba County when two carloads of KKK members led by deputy sheriff Cecil Price abducted and murdered them. Two months later, after their bodies were located, Zinn and other representatives of the SNCC attended a memorial service for the three at the ruins of Mount Zion Methodist Church.

Zinn collaborated with historian Staughton Lynd mentoring student activists, among them Alice Walker, who would later write &quot;The Color Purple,&quot; and Marian Wright Edelman, founder and president of the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund. Edelman identified Zinn as a major influence in her life and, in the same journal article, tells of his accompanying students to a sit-in at the segregated white section of the Georgia state legislature. Zinn also co-wrote a column in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; with fellow activist Eric Mann, &quot;Left Field Stands&quot;.

Although Zinn was a tenured professor, he was dismissed in June 1963 after siding with students in the struggle against segregation. As Zinn described in &quot;The Nation,&quot; though Spelman administrators prided themselves for turning out refined &quot;young ladies&quot;, its students were likely to be found on the picket line, or in jail for participating in the greater effort to break down segregation in public places in Atlanta. Zinn&#x27;s years at Spelman are recounted in his autobiography &quot;You Can&#x27;t Be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times&quot;. His seven years at Spelman College, Zinn said, &quot;are probably the most interesting, exciting, most educational years for me. I learned more from my students than my students learned from me.&quot;

While living in Georgia, Zinn wrote that he observed 30 violations of the First and Fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution in Albany, Georgia, including the rights to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and equal protection under the law. In an article on the civil rights movement in Albany, Zinn described the people who participated in the Freedom Rides to end segregation, and the reluctance of President John F. Kennedy to enforce the law. Zinn said that the Justice Department under Robert F. Kennedy and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, headed by J. Edgar Hoover, did little or nothing to stop the segregationists from brutalizing civil rights workers.

Zinn wrote about the struggle for civil rights, as both participant and historian. His second book, &quot;The Southern Mystique&quot;, was published in 1964, the same year as his &quot;SNCC: The New Abolitionists&quot; in which he describes how the sit-ins against segregation were initiated by students and, in that sense, were independent of the efforts of the older, more established civil rights organizations.

In 2005, forty-one years after he was sacked from Spelman, Zinn returned to the college, where he was given an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters. He delivered the commencement address, titled &quot;Against Discouragement&quot;, and said that &quot;the lesson of that history is that you must not despair, that if you are right, and you persist, things will change. The government may try to deceive the people, and the newspapers and television may do the same, but the truth has a way of coming out. The truth has a power greater than a hundred lies.&quot;

==Anti-war efforts==
===Vietnam===
Zinn wrote one of the earliest books calling for the U.S. withdrawal from its war in Vietnam. &quot;Vietnam: The Logic of Withdrawal&quot; was published by Beacon Press in 1967 based on his articles in &quot;Commonweal&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, and &quot;Ramparts&quot;. In the opinion of Noam Chomsky, &quot;The Logic of Withdrawal&quot; was Zinn&#x27;s most important book:

He was the first person to say—loudly, publicly, very persuasively—that this simply has to stop; we should get out, period, no conditions; we have no right to be there; it&#x27;s an act of aggression; pull out. It was so surprising at the time that there wasn&#x27;t even a review of the book. In fact, he asked me if I would review it in &quot;Ramparts&quot; just so that people would know about the book.

Zinn&#x27;s diplomatic visit to Hanoi with Reverend Daniel Berrigan, during the Tet Offensive in January 1968, resulted in the return of three American airmen, the first American POWs released by the North Vietnamese since the U.S. bombing of that nation had begun. The event was widely reported in the news media and discussed in a variety of books including &quot;Who Spoke Up? American Protest Against the War in Vietnam 1963–1975&quot; by Nancy Zaroulis and Gerald Sullivan. Zinn and the Berrigan brothers, Dan and Philip, remained friends and allies over the years.

Also in January 1968, he signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the war.

In December 1969, radical historians tried unsuccessfully to persuade the American Historical Association to pass an anti-Vietnam War resolution. &quot;A debacle unfolded as Harvard historian (and AHA president in 1968) John Fairbank literally wrestled the microphone from Zinn&#x27;s hands.&quot;

Daniel Ellsberg, a former RAND consultant who had secretly copied &quot;The Pentagon Papers&quot;, which described the history of the United States&#x27; military involvement in Southeast Asia, gave a copy to Howard and Roslyn Zinn. Along with Noam Chomsky, Zinn edited and annotated the copy of &quot;The Pentagon Papers&quot; that Senator Mike Gravel read into the Congressional Record and that was subsequently published by Beacon Press.

Announced on August 17 and published on October 10, 1971, this four-volume, relatively expensive set became the &quot;Senator Gravel Edition&quot;, which studies from Cornell University and the Annenberg Center for Communication have labeled as the most complete edition of the Pentagon Papers to be published. The &quot;Gravel Edition&quot; was edited and annotated by Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn, and included an additional volume of analytical articles on the origins and progress of the war, also edited by Chomsky and Zinn.

Zinn testified as an expert witness at Ellsberg&#x27;s criminal trial for theft, conspiracy, and espionage in connection with the publication of the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Defense attorneys asked Zinn to explain to the jury the history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam from World War II through 1963. Zinn discussed that history for several hours, and later reflected on his time before the jury.

I explained there was nothing in the papers of military significance that could be used to harm the defense of the United States, that the information in them was simply &quot;embarrassing&quot; to our government because what was revealed, in the government&#x27;s own interoffice memos, was how it had lied to the American public... The secrets disclosed in the Pentagon Papers might embarrass politicians, might hurt the profits of corporations wanting tin, rubber, oil, in far-off places. But this was not the same as hurting the nation, the people.

Most of the jurors later said that they voted for acquittal. However, the federal judge who presided over the case dismissed it on grounds it had been tainted by the Nixon administration&#x27;s burglary of the office of Ellsberg&#x27;s psychiatrist.

Zinn&#x27;s testimony on the motivation for government secrecy was confirmed in 1989 by Erwin Griswold, who as U.S. solicitor general during the Nixon administration sued &quot;The New York Times&quot; in the Pentagon Papers case in 1971 to stop publication. Griswold persuaded three Supreme Court justices to vote to stop &quot;The New York Times&quot; from continuing to publish the Pentagon Papers, an order known as &quot;prior restraint&quot; that has been held to be illegal under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The papers were simultaneously published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, effectively nullifying the effect of the prior restraint order. In 1989, Griswold admitted there had been no national security damage resulting from publication. In a column in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Griswold wrote: &quot;It quickly becomes apparent to any person who has considerable experience with classified material that there is massive over-classification and that the principal concern of the classifiers is not with national security, but with governmental embarrassment of one sort or another.&quot;

Zinn supported the G.I. anti-war movement during the U.S. war in Vietnam. In the 2001 film &quot;Unfinished Symphony: Democracy and Dissent&quot;, Zinn provides a historical context for the 1971 anti-war march by Vietnam Veterans against the War. The marchers traveled from Bunker Hill near Boston to Lexington, Massachusetts, &quot;which retraced Paul Revere&#x27;s ride of 1775 and ended in the massive arrest of 410 veterans and civilians by the Lexington police.&quot; The film depicts &quot;scenes from the 1971 Winter Soldier hearings, during which former G.I.s testified about &quot;atrocities&quot; they either participated in or said they had witnessed committed by U.S. forces in Vietnam. Zinn also took part in the 1971 May Day protests (with among others Noam Chomsky and Daniel Ellsberg).

In later years, Zinn was an adviser to the Disarm Education Fund.

===Iraq===
Zinn opposed the 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq and wrote several books about it. In an interview with &quot;The Brooklyn Rail&quot; he said

We certainly should not be initiating a war, as it&#x27;s not a clear and present danger to the United States, or in fact, to anyone around it. If it were, then the states around Iraq would be calling for a war on it. The Arab states around Iraq are opposed to the war, and if anyone&#x27;s in danger from Iraq, they are. At the same time, the U.S. is violating the U.N. charter by initiating a war on Iraq. Bush made a big deal about the number of resolutions Iraq has violated—and it&#x27;s true, Iraq has not abided by the resolutions of the Security Council. But it&#x27;s not the first nation to violate Security Council resolutions. Israel has violated Security Council resolutions every year since 1967. Now, however, the U.S. is violating a fundamental principle of the U.N. Charter, which is that nations can&#x27;t initiate a war—they can only do so after being attacked. And Iraq has not attacked us.

He asserted that the U.S. would end Gulf War II when resistance within the military increased in the same way resistance within the military contributed to ending the U.S. war in Vietnam. Zinn compared the demand by a growing number of contemporary U.S. military families to end the war in Iraq to parallel demands &quot;in the Confederacy in the Civil War, when the wives of soldiers rioted because their husbands were dying and the plantation owners were profiting from the sale of cotton, refusing to grow grains for civilians to eat.&quot;

Zinn believed that U.S. President George W. Bush and followers of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the former leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, who was personally responsible for beheadings and numerous attacks designed to cause civil war in Iraq, should be considered moral equivalents.

Jean-Christophe Agnew, Professor of History and American Studies at Yale University, told the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; in May 2007 that Zinn&#x27;s historical work is &quot;highly influential and widely used&quot;. He observed that it is not unusual for prominent professors such as Zinn to weigh in on current events, citing a resolution opposing the war in Iraq that was recently ratified by the American Historical Association. Agnew added: &quot;In these moments of crisis, when the country is split—so historians are split.&quot;

==Socialism==
Zinn described himself as &quot;something of an anarchist, something of a socialist. Maybe a democratic socialist.&quot; He suggested looking at socialism in its full historical context as a popular, positive idea that got a bad name from its association with Soviet Communism. In Madison, Wisconsin, in 2009, Zinn said:

==FBI files==
On July 30, 2010, a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request resulted in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) releasing a file with 423 pages of information on Howard Zinn&#x27;s life and activities. During the height of McCarthyism in 1949, the FBI first opened a domestic security investigation on Zinn (FBI File # 100-360217), based on Zinn&#x27;s activities in what the agency considered to be communist front groups, such as the American Labor Party, and informant reports that Zinn was an active member of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA). Zinn denied ever being a member and said that he had participated in the activities of various organizations which might be considered Communist fronts, but that his participation was motivated by his belief that in this country people had the right to believe, think, and act according to their own ideals. According to journalist Chris Hedges, Zinn &quot;steadfastly refused to cooperate in the anti-communist witchhunts in the 1950s.&quot;

Later in the 1960s, as a result of Zinn&#x27;s campaigning against the Vietnam War and his communication with Martin Luther King Jr., the FBI designated him a high security risk to the country by adding him to the Security Index, a list of American citizens who could be summarily arrested if a state of emergency were to be declared. The FBI memos also show that they were concerned with Zinn&#x27;s repeated criticism of the FBI for failing to protect black people against white mob violence. Zinn&#x27;s daughter said she was not surprised by the files: &quot;He always knew they had a file on him&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Zinn married Roslyn Shechter in 1944. They remained married until her death in 2008. They had a daughter, Myla, and a son, Jeff. Myla is the wife of mindfulness instructor Jon Kabat-Zinn.

Zinn was swimming in a hotel pool when he died of an apparent heart attack in Santa Monica, California, on January 27, 2010, at the age of 87. He was scheduled to speak during an event which was titled &quot;A Collection of Ideas... the People Speak&quot; at the Crossroads School and the Santa Monica Museum of Art.

In one of his last interviews, Zinn stated that he would like to be remembered &quot;for introducing a different way of thinking about the world, about war, about human rights, about equality,&quot; and

for getting more people to realize that the power which rests so far in the hands of people with wealth and guns, that the power ultimately rests in people themselves and that they can use it. At certain points in history, they have used it. Black people in the South used it. People in the women&#x27;s movement used it. People in the anti-war movement used it. People in other countries who have overthrown tyrannies have used it.

He said he wanted to be known as &quot;somebody who gave people a feeling of hope and power that they didn&#x27;t have before.&quot;

==Notable recognition==
*2008 Howard Zinn was selected as a special senior advisor to Miguel d&#x27;Escoto Brockmann, the president of the United Nations General Assembly 63rd session.
*Established by a former Boston University student of Zinn&#x27;s and two nonprofit organizations (Rethinking Schools and Teaching for Change) while he was alive, the Zinn Education Project is Howard Zinn&#x27;s legacy to middle- and high-school teachers and their students. The project offers classroom teachers free lessons based on &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot; and like-minded history texts.

==Awards==
In 1991 the Thomas Merton Center for Peace and Social Justice in Pittsburgh awarded Zinn the Thomas Merton Award for his activism and work on national and international issues that transform our world. For his leadership in the Peace Movement, Zinn received the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award in 1996. In 1998 he received the Eugene V. Debs Award, the Firecracker Alternative Book Award in the Politics category for &quot;The Zinn Reader: Writings on Disobedience and Democracy&quot;, and the Lannan Literary Award for nonfiction. The following year he won the Upton Sinclair Award, which honors those whose work illustrates an abiding commitment to social justice and equality.

In 2003, Zinn was awarded the &quot;Prix des Amis du Monde diplomatique&quot; for the French version of his seminal work, &quot;Une histoire populaire des Etats-Unis.&quot;

On October 5, 2006, Zinn received the Haven&#x27;s Center Award for Lifetime Contribution to Critical Scholarship in Madison, Wisconsin.

==Reception==
In July 2013, the Associated Press revealed that Mitch Daniels, when he was the sitting Republican Governor of Indiana, asked for assurance from his education advisors that Zinn&#x27;s works were not taught in K–12 public schools in the state. The AP had gained access to Daniels&#x27; emails under a Freedom of Information Act request. Daniels also wanted a &quot;cleanup&quot; of K–12 professional development courses to eliminate &quot;propaganda and highlight (if there is any) the more useful offerings.&quot; In one of the emails, Daniels expressed contempt for Zinn upon his death:
At the time the emails were released, Daniels was serving as the president of Purdue University. In response, 90 Purdue professors issued an open letter expressing their concern. Because of Daniels&#x27; attempt to remove Zinn&#x27;s book, the former governor was accused of censorship, to which Daniels responded by saying that his views were misrepresented, and that if Zinn were alive and a member of the Purdue faculty, he would defend his free speech rights and right to publish. But he said that would not give Zinn an &quot;entitlement to have that work foisted on school children in public schools.&quot;

Stanford education professor Sam Wineburg has criticized Zinn&#x27;s research. Wineburg acknowledged that &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot; was an important contribution for overlooked alternative perspectives, but criticized the book&#x27;s coverage of the mid-thirties to the Cold War. According to reviewer David Plotnikoff from Stanford, Wineburg shows that &quot;&quot;A People&#x27;s History&quot; perpetrates the same errors of historical practice as the tomes it aimed to correct&quot;, for &quot;Zinn&#x27;s desire to cast a light on what he saw as historic injustice was a crusade built on secondary sources of questionable provenance, omission of exculpatory evidence, leading questions and shaky connections between evidence and conclusions&quot;.

Daniel J. Flynn, an author and columnist at the conservative &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, wrote that Zinn&#x27;s history was biased. Michael Kazin, professor at Georgetown University and co-editor of the leftist magazine &quot;Dissent,&quot;, praised Zinn&#x27;s &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot; for its dramatic condemnation of the exploitation of the masses by an elite few, and for its lavish use of quotes from social rebels and revolutionaries, though he describes it as somewhat simplified. Kazin has also provided criticism saying &quot;&quot;A People&#x27;s History&quot; is bad history, albeit gilded with virtuous intentions. Zinn reduces the past to a Manichean fable.&quot;

Mary Grabar, a resident fellow at the Alexander Hamilton Institute for the Study of Western Civilization, accused Zinn of plagiarizing a polemic by novelist and anti-Vietnam War activist Hans Koning in &quot;The People&#x27;s History&quot;, and editing Koning&#x27;s narrative to remove what Grabar said was the &quot;devout Catholic Columbus’s concern for the natives&quot;.

In early 2017, lawmaker Kim Hendren attempted to ban books written by Zinn from Arkansas public schools.

<text>Matthew Wade Stairs (born February 27, 1968) is a Canadian former professional baseball outfielder, first baseman, and designated hitter, who holds the record for most pinch-hit home runs in Major League Baseball (MLB) history with 23. His pinch-hit home run in the eighth inning of Game 4 in the 2008 National League Championship Series off the Los Angeles Dodgers reliever Jonathan Broxton was called &quot;one of the most memorable home runs in Phillies history&quot;.

In his career, Stairs played for more teams than any position player in MLB history (12 – technically 13 teams, but 12 franchises, as he played for the Montreal Expos and Washington Nationals); Edwin Jackson holds the record for pitchers and all players at 14. Additionally he is one of only four Canadians to have played for both the Toronto Blue Jays and Montreal Expos, the others being Denis Boucher, Rob Ducey, and Shawn Hill.

He was the second Canadian-born player ever to hit more than thirty-five home runs in a season, and only the second to hit more than 25 home runs and drive in more than 100 runs in back-to-back seasons. He ranks either first or second in power hitting categories for Canadian major leaguers. Stairs also holds the all-time MLB record of home runs hit as a pinch-hitter with 23. His ability to pinch hit made him a valuable asset to several teams and earned him the nickname &quot;Matt Stairs – Professional Hitter&quot;. Stairs, Larry Walker, Justin Morneau, Jason Bay, and Joey Votto are the only Canadian MLB players to hit at least 200 career home runs. On February 4, 2015, Stairs was elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Born in Saint John and raised in Tay Creek, New Brunswick, Stairs showed athletic ability at an early age, playing Beaver League baseball a year before his age eligibility; he also excelled in hockey. After playing Bantam &amp; Midget baseball at age 16 and 17, he played for the local Marysville Royals of the New Brunswick Senior Baseball League and was voted &quot;Rookie of The Year&quot; in 1984 and the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player in 1985. He was also named Nova Scotia Senior Baseball League MVP in 1987 and &#x27;88 while playing for the Fredericton Schooners.

He attended the National Baseball Institute (NBI) in Vancouver, British Columbia for one year and played for Canada at the 1987 World Amateur Championships in Italy where he was named to the &quot;World All-Star&quot; team. In 1988, he joined the Canadian Junior National team after graduating from Fredericton High School. From there he went on to play for the Canadian Olympic Team at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.

==Minor league career==
On January 17, 1989, Stairs was signed as an international free agent by the Montreal Expos. Stairs was then assigned to low single-A Jamestown Expos where he played second and third base. He played Double-A ball in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania for the Harrisburg Senators, where he led the league in hitting and was voted the Eastern League&#x27;s 1991 Most Valuable Player. In 1992 and 1993, he moved up to Triple-A (Indianapolis and Ottawa, respectively), with only brief appearances in the majors. Over his career, Stairs has played for six other minor league teams: The Indianapolis Indians (Triple-A) in 1992, the Ottawa Lynx (Triple-A) in 1993, the New Britain Red Sox (Double-A) in 1994, the Pawtucket Red Sox (Triple-A) in 1995, the Edmonton Trappers (Triple-A) in 1996 and a few rehab games for the Nashville Sounds (Triple-A) in 2003. His totals in the minors include a .291 batting average with 46 home runs and 237 RBI.

On June 8, 1993, Stairs&#x27; contract was purchased by the Chunichi Dragons of the NPB. He played 60 games for the Dragons that season, hitting .250, with six home runs and 23 RBI in 142 at bats.

==Major league career==
===Montreal Expos===
Stairs began his Major League career in 1992 with the Montreal Expos, with whom he played sporadically throughout the season. On December 15, 1993, he was re-signed as a free agent by Montreal. He ended up only playing in 19 games for the Expos from 1992 to 1993. Stairs was sold on February 18, 1994, to the Boston Red Sox and assigned to the Double-A New Britain Red Sox for the 1994 season, where he batted .309 with nine home runs and 61 RBI in 93 games.

===Boston Red Sox===
He started the 1995 season with the Pawtucket farm club until being called up to the major leagues in June 1995. He played in 39 games for the Red Sox, hitting .261 with a home run and 17 RBI. At the end of the season, he accepted an offer to play with the Oakland Athletics after becoming a free agent.

===Oakland Athletics===
Stairs had the best years of his career playing for the Athletics. He was called up from Triple-A Edmonton in 1996, after crushing International League pitching to a tune of a .344 average with eight home runs and 41 RBI over the first 51 games. He played mostly in right field and as a designated hitter, alongside superstars Rickey Henderson, Mark McGwire, and Jose Canseco, throughout his tenure in Oakland.

In his July 5, 1996 debut with Oakland, Stairs tied a major league record with six runs batted in during one inning. That first inning performance included a grand slam and a two-run single (subsequently broken by Fernando Tatís in 1999). In 1999, he finished 17th in the American League in the MVP race with a .258 batting average, 38 home runs and 102 RBI in 146 games.

After five seasons with the Athletics, during which he hit 122 home runs and drove in 315 RBI, he was traded on November 20, 2000, to the Chicago Cubs for minor league pitcher Eric Ireland. The trade was largely seen as a cost-cutting move by the cash-strapped Athletics—Stairs was set to earn $3.2 million for the 2001 season, and his production had dropped in 2000, hitting just .227 with 21 home runs and 81 RBI.

===Chicago Cubs===
On December 19, 2000, Stairs agreed to a one-year, $3.2 million contract with the Cubs to avoid arbitration. He served as the first baseman for the Cubs in 2001. Stairs had an OBP of .358 and batted .250 with 17 home runs and 61 RBI in 128 games. He then became a free agent after the season.

===Milwaukee Brewers===
On January 25, 2002, Stairs signed a one-year, $500,000 contract with the Milwaukee Brewers for the 2002 season. In 2002, Stairs had a similar season to the previous one with the Cubs. He finished the season with 16 home runs and 41 RBI in 107 games, but still had a low batting average, hitting .244.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
On December 16, 2002, Stairs agreed to a one-year, $900,000 contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates. 2003 was a strong year for Stairs. He finished the year batting .292 with 20 home runs and 57 RBI in 128 games while playing as a first baseman and outfielder. Stairs&#x27; 2003 season included a three-game series back in Canada against the Blue Jays. In the three games at Rogers Centre (then called the Skydome), Stairs had five hits in eight at-bats, which included two long home runs.

===Kansas City Royals===
On December 9, 2003, Stairs signed a one-year deal with the Kansas City Royals. He went on to enjoy three solid years with the Royals, hitting 39 home runs in his two-and-a-half years in Kansas City. Despite being on one of the worst teams in baseball, Stairs helped some of the younger players like John Buck and David DeJesus adjust to the majors. On July 31, 2006, at the trade deadline, Stairs was dealt to the Texas Rangers for Joselo Díaz.

===Texas Rangers===
The Rangers hoped that Stairs could provide some veteran leadership on their club, but he just played in 26 games, batting .210 with three home runs and 11 RBI before being waived by the Rangers. He was picked up off waivers by the Detroit Tigers on September 15, 2006.

===Detroit Tigers===
On the day he was claimed, he immediately went to Detroit, arriving at Comerica Park halfway through the game and immediately taking Marcus Thames&#x27;s place in the lineup. The Tigers picked up Stairs in hopes that his experience could help them hold their division lead. The Tigers lost their division lead on the final day of the season, but still clinched the Wild Card. In 14 games with the Tigers, Stairs batted .244 with two home runs and 8 RBI. Since he was acquired after August 31, the deadline for play-off eligible players, he was unable to play for the Tigers during the playoffs. The Tigers went on to win the AL Pennant and lost in the World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals. He did not re-sign with the Tigers following the season.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
On December 7, 2006, Stairs and the Toronto Blue Jays agreed to a one-year minor-league contract with an invitation to spring training. He made the team and saw significant playing time as the fourth outfielder, replacing Lyle Overbay at first base during Overbay&#x27;s time on the DL. The 2007 season rejuvenated Stairs&#x27; career, due to increased playing time following injuries to Reed Johnson and Overbay. Unexpectedly playing every day, he performed well above expectations, providing consistency at the plate and a valuable veteran presence in the Toronto dugout; team manager John Gibbons publicly stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t know where we&#x27;d be without him.&quot; As of September 4, Stairs had the highest slugging average on the Jays at .606 and the highest batting average at .312.

On August 8, 2007, Stairs became the first Toronto Blue Jays player to hit five consecutive doubles in five at-bats, and the first Major Leaguer to double in five straight at-bats in fourteen years since Charles Johnson accomplished the feat in 1993. As of September 8, 2007, Stairs was playing well for the Blue Jays, with a team-leading .315 average on the season and a .989 OPS. He finished the season batting .289 with 21 home runs and 64 RBIs—good numbers for a 39-year-old with only about 400 at bats in the year.

On November 2, 2007, Stairs and the Blue Jays agreed on a two-year, $3.25 million contract, which included a $1.25 million signing bonus and a $1 million base salary in each of the two seasons. With performance bonuses, Stairs could make as much as $3.5 million based on plate appearances.

Though his age and increasingly poor speed earned him a reputation as a defensive liability in the outfield, he still possessed a strong throwing arm, and was considered a perfectly capable fielder at first. In 2008, Stairs initially platooned in left field with Shannon Stewart; however, upon the club&#x27;s release of Frank Thomas on April 20 Stairs became the everyday DH for the ball club, although was later designated for assignment on August 28, 2008.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
On August 30, 2008, Stairs was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for Fabio Castro.

Stairs hit his first career postseason home run on October 13, 2008, in Game 4 of the 2008 National League Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers off Jonathan Broxton, allowing the Phillies to take the lead and win the game.

He won the first World Series ring of his 16-year career on October 29, 2008, when the Phillies won the series against the Rays, four games to one. On April 12, 2009, Stairs&#x27; game-winning home run against the Colorado Rockies was the last home run called by broadcaster Harry Kalas, who died unexpectedly less than 24 hours later.

Stairs faced Broxton again in the ninth inning of Game 4 of the 2009 NLCS rematch between the Phillies and Dodgers at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. Broxton pitched around Stairs, walking him on four pitches. The Phillies won the game later in the inning on a walk-off double by Jimmy Rollins, on which Stairs&#x27; pinch runner Eric Bruntlett scored. In the 2009 season, he once again made it to the World Series, but the Phillies lost to the New York Yankees in six games.

During his time with the team, T-shirts were marketed which touched on Stairs&#x27; pinch-hitting prowess in clutch situations. They used a warning which can be found in many elevators: &quot;In Case of Emergency, Use Stairs.&quot;

===San Diego Padres===

On January 23, 2010, Stairs agreed to a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres with an invite to spring training hoping to crack their 25-man roster out of spring as a left-handed bat off the bench. During the offseason, he lost nearly 40 pounds, which helped him make the team out of spring training. When he joined the Padres, he became the only player in MLB history to play for all four of the 1969 expansion teams (the Padres, Royals, Expos, and Brewers). On August 21, Stairs hit his 21st home run as a pinch hitter to break a tie with Cliff Johnson for the Major League record.

===Washington Nationals===
On December 14, 2010, the Washington Nationals signed Stairs to a non-guaranteed minor league contract, which included an invitation to Major League Spring training. After spring training, he was placed on the 25-man roster and went north with the team. Mostly used as a pinch hitter, with four appearances at first base, in 65 at-bats he had 10 hits and two RBIs. He was designated for assignment on July 27, 2011. He was released on August 1 and announced his retirement two days later.

==Coaching career==
On November 2, 2016, Stairs was hired as the hitting coach for the Philadelphia Phillies.

On October 30, 2017, Stairs was hired as the hitting coach for the San Diego Padres. He was fired after one season.

In 2024, Stairs was hired to the Okotoks Dawgs Baseball Club as the program’s Academy Coaching Staff as the Dawgs Hitting Coordinator.

==Career perspective==
Noted baseball analysts Bill James and Joe Posnanski have theorized that Stairs is probably a far more talented hitter than his career stats suggest. Stairs didn&#x27;t have 500 plate appearances until age 30, at which point he recorded 100 RBI seasons and an adjusted OPS of over 130 two years in a row—and never exceeded 500 plate appearances again after 3 straight seasons of 500 or more from 1998-2000. James contends, &quot;You put him in the right park, right position early in his career ... he&#x27;s going to hit a LOT of bombs.&quot; Possibly, Posnanski contends, enough to have been worthy of Hall of Fame consideration.

==Other work and personal life==
In January 2012, Stairs accepted a job with the NESN sports news station to work as a Boston Red Sox studio analyst. On February 11, 2014, the Phillies announced that Stairs and fellow former-Phillie Jamie Moyer would join the team&#x27;s television broadcasting crew as color analysts, following the dismissal of Gary Matthews and Chris Wheeler. Stairs worked with play-by-play commentator Tom McCarthy and in-game reporter Gregg Murphy, and occasionally with Ben Davis, before moving to the Phillies&#x27; dugout as the team&#x27;s hitting coach starting with the 2017 season.

He is married to Lisa Astle of Fredericton with whom he has three daughters, Nicole, Alicia and Chandler. He lives in Fredericton and was named coach of the Fredericton High School ice hockey team in 2012, a job he had often referred to as his dream.

Stairs was inducted into the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame in June 2012.

On June 15, 2015, Stairs was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.

In November 2016, Stairs was among those nominated and placed on the 2017 ballot for the Baseball Hall of Fame; he did not receive enough votes to appear on future ballots.

<text>Jumpman is a platform game written by Randy Glover and published by Epyx in 1983. It was developed for the Atari 8-bit computers, and versions were also released for the Commodore 64, Apple II, and IBM PC compatibles.

The game received very favorable reviews when it was released and was a major hit for its publisher, Automated Simulations. It was so successful that the company renamed itself Epyx, formerly their brand for action titles like &quot;Jumpman&quot;.

&quot;Jumpman&quot; was published on diskette, but a version of the game with 12 new levels instead of 30 was released on cartridge as &quot;Jumpman Junior&quot;. It was available on the Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64, and ColecoVision.

==Gameplay==
According to the story, the base on Jupiter has been sabotaged by terrorists who have placed bombs throughout the base&#x27;s three buildings. The object of the game is to defuse all the bombs in a platform-filled screen. Jumpman defuses a bomb by touching it. Jumpman can jump, climb up and down ladders, and there are two kinds of rope each allowing a single direction of climbing only.

The game map is organized into a series of levels, representing the floors in three buildings. When all of the bombs on a level have been deactivated, the map scrolls vertically to show another floor of the building. When all of the levels in a building are complete, a screen shows the remaining buildings and moves onto the next one. The order of the maps is randomized so players do not end up trapped on a level they cannot complete.

Hazards include falling &quot;smart darts&quot; (small bullets that fly slowly across the screen, but when orthogonally lined up with Jumpman, greatly speed up and shoot straight in his direction), fall damage, and other hazards that are unique to a certain level. Upon being hit or falling from a height, Jumpman tumbles down to the bottom of the screen, with a measure from Chopin&#x27;s Funeral March being played.

Points are awarded for each bomb defused, with bonus points available for completing a level quickly. Jumpman&#x27;s game run-speed can be chosen by the player, with faster speeds being riskier but providing greater opportunity to earn bonus points.

==Development==
Randy Glover was living in Foster City, California and had been experimenting with electronics when he saw his first computer in 1977 when he played &quot;Star Trek&quot; at a Berkeley university open house. This prompted him to purchase a Commodore PET in 1978 and then upgrade to a TRS-80 due to its support of a hard drive.

&quot;Jumpman&quot; came about after Glover saw &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; in a local Pizza Hut. This led him to become interested in making a version for home computers. He visited a local computer store who had the TI-99/4A and Atari 400. He initially purchased the TI-99 due to its better keyboard, but when he learned the graphics were based on character set manipulation, he returned it the next day and purchased the Atari.

The initial version was written by Albert Persinger, using a compiler on the Apple II, moving the software to the Atari. A prototype with 13 levels took four or five months to complete. After looking in the back of a computer magazine for publisher, in early 1983 he approached Broderbund. They were interested but demanded that their programmers be allowed to work on it. The next day he met with Automated Simulations, who were much more excited by the game and agreed to allow Glover to complete it himself.

At the time, the company was in the process of moving from the strategy game market to action titles, which they released under their Epyx brand. &quot;Jumpman&quot; was the perfect title for the brand, and the company hired him. Aiming the game at the newly enlarged RAM available on the Atari 800 led to the 32 levels of the final design. The Atari release was a huge hit, and the company soon abandoned their strategic games and renamed as Epyx. Glover then moved on to a C64 port, which was not trivial due to a particular feature of the Atari hardware Glover used to ease development.

Other programmers at Epyx ported it to the Apple II, with poor results, and, a year later, contracted Mirror Images Software for an IBM PC/PCjr port. The Atari and Commodore versions were released on disk and cassette tape, the Apple and IBM versions only on disk. The Atari version used a classic bad-sector method of preventing copying, but this had little effect on piracy.

After developing the original versions, Glover moved on to &quot;Jumpman Junior&quot;, a cartridge title with only 12 levels. He stated that it wasn&#x27;t really a sequel to &quot;Jumpman&quot;, but more of a &quot;lite&quot; version for Atari and Commodore users who didn&#x27;t have disk drives. These versions removed the more complex levels and any code needed to run them. Two of its levels (Dumbwaiter and Electroshock Traps) were turned into Sreddal (&quot;Ladders&quot; backwards) and Fire! Fire! on the latter. The C64 version was later ported to the ColecoVision, which used the C64 levels.

Glover continued working at Epyx, working on the little-known &quot;Lunar Outpost&quot; and the swimming section of &quot;Summer Games&quot;. He remained at the company for about two years before returning to the cash register business.

===Technical details===
Movement was controlled through the collision detection system of the Atari&#x27;s player/missile graphics hardware. This system looks for overlap between the sprites and the background, setting registers that indicate which sprite had touched which color.

Glover separated the Jumpman sprite into two parts, the body and the feet. By examining which of these collided, the engine could determine which direction to move. For instance, if both the body and feet collided with the same color, it must be a wall, and the Jumpman should stop moving. If there was no collision with either his feet or body, Jumpman is unsupported and should fall down the screen. Variations on these allowed support for ramps, ropes, and other features.

This not only saved processing time comparing the player location to an in-memory description of the map, but also meant that maps could be created simply by drawing with them and experimenting with the results in the game.

==Reception==
&quot;Jumpman&quot; became a best-seller for Epyx, selling about 40,000 copies on the Atari and C64 until 1987, reaching somewhere between #3 and #6 on the then-current &quot;Billboard&quot; top 100 games chart. Sales were hindered by the release of &quot;Miner 2049er&quot; only a few months earlier, which held the #1 spot at that time. 

&quot;Softline&quot; in 1983 liked &quot;Jumpman&quot;, calling it &quot;wonderfully addicting&quot; and stating that it was as high-quality as Epyx&#x27;s &quot;Dunjonquest&quot; games. The magazine cited its large number of levels (&quot;Not one screen faster and harder each time; not ten screens three times; but thirty screens, one at a time&quot;), and concluded that &quot;it&#x27;s bound to be a hit&quot;. &quot;Compute!&quot; wrote that it might be dismissed as yet another platform game, but said that &quot;Jumpman easily conquers that skepticism and establishes itself as a software classic&quot;. The magazine noted the variety of clever level designs that made each map unique. Comparing it to &quot;Miner 2049er&quot;, &quot;Compute!&quot; suggested that &quot;Jumpman&quot; is &quot;much, much more&quot;. &quot;InfoWorld&#x27;s Essential Guide to Atari Computers&quot; cited it as a standout among Epyx&#x27;s arcade games.

&quot;K-Power&quot; rated the Commodore 64 version of &quot;Jumpman&quot; 7 points out of 10. The magazine stated that the game &quot;has very good—not great—graphics, color, and sound. But because it&#x27;s so enjoyable to play, it will be a long time before it&#x27;s put away.&quot; Stating that &quot;the care that goes into its products is obvious in Jumpman&quot;, &quot;The Commodore 64 Home Companion&quot; wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s really 30 games in one, with seemingly endless variants on the simple jumping theme to keep you interested&quot;.

In 1984 &quot;Softline&quot; readers named the game the seventh most-popular Atari program of 1983, and it received a Certificate of Merit in the category of &quot;1984 Best Computer Action Game&quot; at the 5th annual Arkie Awards.

==Legacy==
In 1998, Randy Glover became aware of the many fans of &quot;Jumpman&quot; and started working on &quot;Jumpman II&quot;, keeping a development diary at the now defunct jumpman2.com site. The last recorded diary entry was made in 2001.

In 2008, the original &quot;Jumpman&quot; was released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console.

In 2014, Midnight Ryder Technologies shipped &quot;Jumpman Forever&quot; for the OUYA micro-console, with planned releases for PC, Mac, iOS, and Android platforms. Originally titled &quot;Jumpman: 2049&quot;, the game is considered to be an official sequel based on rights given to Midnight Ryder Technologies back in 2000 by Randy Glover.

In 2018 &quot;Jumpman&quot; was re-released on THEC64 Mini as one of the 64 built in games. A game called &quot;Jumpman 2&quot; was also on the machine, but in reality is just &quot;Jumpman Junior&quot; rebranded.

=== Unofficial ports and fan remakes ===
In 1991, &quot;Jumpman Lives!&quot; was released by Apogee Software. The game consists of four &quot;episodes&quot;, each with twelve levels: the first is free, the rest for sale. The game contains levels from &quot;Jumpman&quot; and &quot;Jumpman Junior&quot;, new levels, and a level editor. Apogee withdrew the game soon after release at the request of Epyx, who owned the rights to &quot;Jumpman&quot; at the time.

In 1994, an unofficial MS-DOS port of &quot;Jumpman&quot;, missing the level &quot;Freeze&quot;, was released by Ingenieurbüro Franke. An updated version which included Freeze was released in 2001.

In 2003, &quot;The Jumpman Project&quot;, an MS-DOS version of the game that can be run under Microsoft Windows, was released.

<text>Rainmaking is a weather modification ritual that attempts to invoke rain. It is based on the belief that humans can influence nature, spirits, or the ancestors who withhold or bring rain.

Among the best known examples of weather modification rituals are North American rain dances, historically performed by many Native American tribes, particularly in the Southwestern United States. Some of these weather modification rituals are still implemented today.

==American Rainmakers==

Julia M. Buttree (the wife of Ernest Thompson Seton) describes the rain dance of the Zuni, along with other Native American dances, in her book &quot;The Rhythm of the Redman&quot;. Feathers and turquoise, or other blue items, are worn during the ceremony to symbolize wind and rain respectively. Details on how best to perform the Rain Dance have been passed down by oral tradition. In an early sort of meteorology, Native Americans in the midwestern parts of the modern United States often tracked and followed known weather patterns while offering to perform a rain dance for settlers in return for trade items. This is best documented among the Osage and Quapaw tribes of Missouri and Arkansas.

In April 2011, Texas governor Rick Perry called the Days of Prayer for Rain in the State of Texas, asking that Texans pray for &quot;the healing of our land [Texas]&quot; and for an end to the drought.

In the Ozarks, multiple methods of attempting to call rain have been documented:
==African Rainmakers==
Rain is a central concern of African societies which depend on it for their sustenance and that of their animals. The power to make rain is usually attributed to African kings. In a number of African societies, kings who failed to produce the expected rain ran the risk of being blamed as scapegoats and killed by their people. 

=== Tunisia ===

Omek Tannou is an ancient Tunisian rainmaking ritual which was inherited from Punic and Berber traditions involving invocations of the goddess Tanit. It is now all but extinct.

=== San people ===
Among the San, shamans enter a trance and go into the spirit world themselves to capture the animals associated with rain.

===Lobedu people &amp; the Mashona people===
A famous rain making monarch is the Rain Queen of Balobedu, South Africa. Queen Modjadji, or the Rain Queen, is the hereditary queen of Balobedu, a people of the Limpopo Province of South Africa. The Rain Queen is believed to have special powers, including the ability to control the clouds and rainfall. She is known as a mystical and historic figure who brought rain to her allies and drought to her enemies. The Lozi people are closely related to the Balobedu and therefore also have rainmaking abilities. Queen Modjadji is believed to have come from the Shona. The Shona have some of the most powerful rainmaking abilities of the Southern Bantu as it was mainly practiced there until the late 1500s

===Mbukushu people===
The Hambukushu are renowned for their rain-making abilities in the Okavango Delta, earning them the title &quot;The Rain-makers of Okavango.&quot;

==Asian Rainmakers==
In Thailand and Cambodia, various rites exist to obtain rain in times of drought. The most peculiar of these is probably the procession of Lady Cat, during which a cat is carried around in procession through the streets of villages while villagers splash water at the cat, in hope that as water has come on the cat, water will fall on humans as well.
===China===
Wu Shamans in ancient China performed sacrificial rain dance ceremonies in times of drought. Wu anciently served as intermediaries with nature spirits believed to control rainfall and flooding.
&quot;Shamans had to carry out an exhausting dance within a ring of fire until, sweating profusely, the falling drops of perspirations produced the desired rain.&quot;
==European Rainmakers==
Roman religion had a ceremony called the (Latin: &quot;calling the waters&quot;) which sought to produce rain in times of drought. During the ceremony, the had the (&quot;Water-flowing stone&quot;. Festus distinguishes it from another , &quot;stone of the Manes&quot;) brought from its usual resting place, the Temple of Mars in Clivo near the Porta Capena, into the Senate. Offerings were made to Jupiter petitioning for rain, and water was ceremonially poured over the stone.

&quot;Caloian&quot;, &quot;Dodola and Perperuna&quot;, among other terms, refer to a family of Slavic and Romanian rainmaking rituals, some of which survived into the 20th century.

<doc id="88515" wikidata="Q207426" url="?curid=88515" title="Alejandro Toledo">
<text>Alejandro Celestino Toledo Manrique (; born 28 March 1946) is a Peruvian former politician who served as President of Peru, from 2001 to 2006. He gained international prominence after leading the opposition against president Alberto Fujimori, who held the presidency from 1990 to 2000. On 21 October 2024 he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for taking $35 million dollars in bribes to award the Brazilian company Odebrecht with a highway contract.

He pursued his undergraduate and graduate education at the University of San Francisco and Stanford University. He originally joined the technical and academic field, from where he participated as an analyst on politics and economics on some occasions. He entered politics when he founded the Possible Peru party, participating for the first time in the 1995 Peruvian general election. In 2000, he managed to become the largest opposition leader to the government of Alberto Fujimori, before whom in the midst of a controversial and bumpy process, lost the election for a second time. After a transition stage, he participated for the third time in the 2001 Peruvian general election against Lourdes Flores of National Unity and Alan García of the Peruvian Aprista Party; he competed with the latter in the second round, winning with 53.1% of the popular vote.

His administration was characterized by macroeconomic boom, promoting foreign investment, the signing of free trade agreements, and the implementation of various investment projects in infrastructure and human development. At the same time, Toledo suffered a governance crisis, scandals in his personal life, and allegations of corruption against his inner circle, signs that hit his popularity until he fell to 8% of popular approval. Subsequently, he would try to regain the presidency in the 2011 Peruvian general election, placing fourth. He later placed eighth in the 2016 Peruvian general election.

Following his presidency, he served as a distinguished resident member of the Center for Advanced Study and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, and as visiting professor at the Center for Democracy, Development and Law Enforcement at the Freeman Spogli Institute. Toledo has been a speaker at conferences in different countries on economics, social inclusion, and democracy, as well as a leader of his political party, the defunct Possible Peru. In 2006, he founded the Global Center for Development and Democracy, an organization advocating sustainable democracies, and between 2009 and 2010 he was a visiting professor at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, and as professor of Foreign Policy at the Brookings Institution.

On 16 July 2019, Toledo was arrested in the United States for an extradition order to Peru, as reported by the Peruvian Public Ministry. On 8 August, attorney Graham Archer, requested a request for release on bail before judge Thomas Hixson. On 12 September, the judge ruled his request for reconsideration inadmissible. On 19 March 2020, he was released on bail. On 28 September 2021, a U.S. District Court approved the extradition of Toledo, ruling that evidence presented in the case against Toledo were &quot;sufficient to sustain the charges of collusion and money laundering&quot; under the U.S. Peru Extradition Treaty. On 23 April 2023, Toledo was extradited from the US to Peru.

==Early life==
Toledo was born into an impoverished peasant Quechuan family. He was the eighth oldest of sixteen brothers and sisters, seven of whom died in childhood. He was born in the village of Ferrer, Bolognesi, but registered in the nearby town of Cabana, Pallasca Province, Ancash Department.

The family moved to Chimbote when Toledo was six years old. As a child he worked shining shoes and selling newspapers and lottery tickets. At age 11, Toledo finished grade school, his father expected him to leave school and get a job to support the family. With his teacher&#x27;s encouragement, Toledo was able to continue his schooling by working nights and weekends, becoming the first person in his family to attend high school. Toledo eventually found employment as a news correspondent for &quot;La Prensa&quot; in Chimbote, where he interviewed several high-ranking politicians.

Toledo&#x27;s prospects improved when two Peace Corps volunteers, Joel Meister and Nancy Deeds, arrived in Chimbote looking for lodging and arrived at his family&#x27;s door. The two Americans were drawn to Toledo by his &quot;industriousness and charm,&quot; and his long conversations with them during the year that followed introduced Toledo to a world outside his small fishing village and inspired him to apply for a local civic group&#x27;s scholarship to study in the United States. He was chosen to receive a one-year grant, and while in the United States, Deeds and Meister helped him get into the University of San Francisco&#x27;s special program for non-English speakers.

Toledo received a BA degree in economics and business administration at University of San Francisco by obtaining a partial scholarship and working part-time pumping gas. Starting in 1970 he attended Stanford University, where he received a MA in education and a M.A. in Economics of Human Resources and, in 1993, a PhD in human resources from the graduate school of education.

==Early career==
From 1981 to 1983, Toledo directed the Institute for Economic and Labor Studies in Lima, a subdivision of the Ministry of Labor and Social Development. During the same period, he also served as chairman of the Economic Advisory Committee to the president of the Central Reserve Bank and the labor minister.

Throughout his academic and governmental career, Toledo worked as a consultant for various international organizations, including the United Nations, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). He led the 1989 UNDP/ILO mission for the evaluation of: &quot;Impact of Macroeconomic Policies on Growth, Employment and Salaries&quot;, in six Central American countries.

Toledo has also been a full time professor at ESAN Graduate School of Business, one of Peru&#x27;s leading business schools, serving as its Director since 1986 to 1991 and remains in ESAN University as licensed professor. From 1991 to 1994, he was an affiliated researcher in the field of international development at the Harvard Institute for International Development. He has also been a guest professor at the University of Waseda in Tokyo and at the Japan Foundation.

== Presidential election ==
Toledo entered politics as an independent candidate for the presidency (winning 3% of the vote) in the 1995 election in which Alberto Fujimori was ultimately re-elected. Despite his loss, the party he founded in 1994, &quot;Perú Posible&quot;, gained popularity and influence over the next few years. Toledo declared his intent to run again in the 2000 election and despite a constitutional controversy about his eligibility to serve a third term, Fujimori also announced his candidacy.

Despite being a relatively low-profile politician, Toledo suddenly found himself the leader of the opposition to Fujimori&#x27;s presidency. Toledo promised to uphold and strengthen the market program that had been put in place, while also mitigating inequality issues attributed to it. He promised to pursue democratic reforms and reinvigorate Peru&#x27;s social infrastructure. During the campaign, he promised to raise the wages of civil servants, which had been stagnant under Fujimori, and to create 400,000 jobs a year through programs designed to encourage agriculture, tourism, and small business. Toledo repeatedly called for the expansion of investigations into government, including investigations into allegations that the Fujimori administration had stolen billions from government coffers.

Racial-ethnic themes also echoed throughout the campaign. Toledo was running to become Peru&#x27;s first indigenous president. He referred to himself as throughout his campaign, and many indigenous Peruvians hoped that as president he would bring greater attention to issues of importance to them. Toledo&#x27;s background, engaging manner, and informal attitude made him an attractive candidate to both indigenous and non-indigenous Peruvians.

Just minutes after the polls closed at 4:00 pm on 9 April 2000, major news networks rushed to announce that Toledo had garnered more votes than Fujimori. These announcements were based on projections from Peru&#x27;s top polling firms, which base their numbers on exit polls. The prominent pollsters quickly modified projections based on samples of actual vote counts from selected polling places, better known as the &quot;quick count&quot;. Shortly after receiving news of Toledo&#x27;s encouraging performance in the initial stage of the vote count, supporters gathered in the streets around Toledo&#x27;s hotel room. An enthusiastic Toledo walked out onto the balcony of his room wearing a red headband, reminiscent of ancient Inca warriors. He optimistically speculated that a first round victory might be within his grasp but still urged his supporters to wait for the results of the quick count. The second wave of quick count results reversed earlier projections, projecting a round one Fujimori plurality and possible majority. Fujimori had a projected lead of 48.73% to 41.03% later that evening. Fujimori was closing in on the 50% mark which would give him a victory in the first round, with no runoff necessary.

Allegations of electoral fraud were made, and were not far-fetched. On the day preceding the election, Transparencia, the national election observation organization, reported that it had received information concerning a website with capabilities to hack into the ONPE (Oficina Nacional de Procesos Electorales) computer system. Eduardo Stein also claimed that ONPE had made no provisions for OAS technicians to monitor the vote count system in real time. Toledo claimed that a fraud had been perpetrated; other opposition candidates agreed and joined protests led by Toledo. Though &quot;the U.S. State Department had supported Fujimori and his economic policies, it described the results of the 2000 elections as &quot;invalid&quot;. Since no candidate had received a majority of the vote, a runoff was required, but Toledo refused to participate in a second round against Fujimori and withdrew from the race on 26 May 2000, two days before the runoff. He unsuccessfully petitioned to have the election annulled, and lobbied international organizations and foreign government to deny recognition to Fujimori&#x27;s government.

On 28 July 2000, Peruvian Independence Day, Fujimori began his third term as president. Toledo led a group of protesters towards Congress. The massive demonstration was peaceful at first, but violence broke out and a powerful explosion led to the death of six people. It was later discovered by the Peruvian judiciary that the explosion had been planned and carried out by the National Intelligence Service, run by Vladimiro Montesinos, who had already been indicted on corruption and bribery charges. Montesinos fled to Venezuela, where he hid for several months before being captured and brought back to Peru. The charges against Montesinos ranged from bribery to drug trafficking to arranging death squads. But it was the release of the &quot;Vladi-videos&quot; that prompted retreat by Fujimori. The first of these incriminating videos showed Montesinos bribing a congressman with US$15,000 to switch to Fujimori&#x27;s camp.

In November 2000, amid growing allegations of fraud and corruption within his administration, Fujimori agreed to hold new elections in 2001, and not to stand as a candidate. While he was attending the APEC forum in Brunei, Fujimori&#x27;s party lost control of the Congress. Fujimori then flew to Japan, where he submitted his resignation and claimed Japanese citizenship.

After the fall of Fujimori, the newly elected president of the Peruvian Congress, Valentín Paniagua, became interim president and oversaw the already planned new elections on 29 May 2001. Toledo won after a close run-off election against former President Alan García of the APRA party, with 52.23% of the vote, to Garcia&#x27;s 47.77%. Toledo thereby became the first South American president of indigenous descent to be democratically elected in five hundred years.

== Presidency (2001–2006) ==
===High expectations===
During his campaign, Toledo promised Peruvians higher wages, a fight against poverty, anti-corruption measures, higher pensions, more employment, military reform, development of tourism, and industrialization. As Pedro Pablo Kuczynski noted &quot;Toledo comes after almost 30 years of either dictatorships or governments that weren&#x27;t so democratic. People expect Toledo to solve all the problems of the last 30 years, which included an enormous increase in relative poverty.&quot; Toledo&#x27;s inability to fulfill many of these promises created widespread dissatisfaction. His approval ratings were consistently low throughout his presidency, sometimes sinking into single digits.

Toledo also promised open market free trade reforms, which reflected Peru&#x27;s business interests while also promising to review Fujimori&#x27;s privatization programs. Specifically, Toledo promised not to privatize any of Peru&#x27;s public utilities. This promise, combined with lofty promises of reduced unemployment and poverty, caused Peru&#x27;s rank and file to set the bar very high for his administration. Shortly after coming to office Toledo met with IMF officials and promised that he would raise $700 million in 2002, and almost one billion dollars in 2003, by selling state assets.

To compound his problems, President Toledo faced a devastating earthquake in his first year in office. This natural disaster left much of Peru morally and fiscally devastated. With many homes and businesses destroyed, economic ills were exacerbated.

===&quot;National Accord&quot;===
In November 2001, Toledo opened talks which concluded in the National Accord of 22 July 2002. In the accord, seven political parties and seven social organizations agreed upon a framework that would guide policy for the next twenty years. The accord set forth twenty-four policy goals divided into four categories: democracy and the rule of law, equity and social justice, economic competitiveness, and an institutional framework of efficiency, transparency, and decentralization. Initially, the accord opened up dialogue in Peru&#x27;s political arena, but within a year, the public considered it to be less effective than had been hoped.

=== Indigenous issues ===
Touting his heritage throughout his campaign, Toledo continued the efforts begun by Paniagua, who had brought together experts and indigenous leaders to discuss the needs of indigenous people throughout the country. Toledo&#x27;s inauguration ceremony on Machu Picchu was attended by all the presidents of the neighboring Andean states who joined him in signing the &quot;Declaration of Machu Picchu,&quot; promising to protect indigenous rights.

Maria Elena García calls the years of Toledo&#x27;s presidency a transition ripe with new opportunities for indigenous people, noting the &quot;reframed state-indigenous interactions&quot;, &quot;increase in NGO projects and social movements&quot;, and &quot;proliferation of indigenous organizations.&quot; Toledo created and first lady Eliane Karp headed a new agency for indigenous and Afro-Peruvian affairs, CONOPA (Commission for Amazonian, Andean, and Afro-Peruvian Peoples). The agency was meant to establish a development agenda for indigenous communities, provide representation of indigenous interests within the government, and lead the way for multicultural constitutional reforms. Some critics viewed these actions as a state co-optation of indigenous identity, mockingly dubbing the agency the &quot;Karp Commission&quot;. However, Oxfam&#x27;s Martin Scurrah points out the agency&#x27;s good work, noting that in addition to promoting a chapter on indigenous rights in the new constitution, Eliane Karp has &quot;intervened on numerous occasions in support of or in defense of indigenous initiatives.&quot;

As president, Toledo made it a priority to try to recover ancient Incan artifacts from Yale University&#x27;s Peabody Museum of Natural History. Some art historians claimed that such artifacts, found at Machu Picchu, could help the Peruvian people to gain knowledge of their ancestry.

He also brought serious attention to bilingual education in indigenous schools, creating a new and well-staffed division within the Ministry of Education devoted to the issue. This effort gives advocates greater autonomy and opportunity to influence policy and work toward institutionalizing bilingual education.

Toledo&#x27;s efforts at decentralization sought to give indigenous groups greater influence upon policy-making on a regional level. The first regional and local elections, held in November 2002, required that 15% of the candidates in regions with an indigenous presence must have indigenous backgrounds. However, decentralization has been viewed critically by some, who claim that in dividing up regions, administrators have at times ignored the distinctive cultural and historical factors that define different areas.

In a speech to the Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples in Latin America conference, Toledo expressed disappointment at the growing disparity between the incomes of indigenous people and other citizens. Despite the growth achieved by the Peruvian economy, the poverty gap has widened between the upper and lower classes. Toledo mentions the reintegration of the indigenous populations into the Peruvian social and political system as a key to sustainability and economic growth.

Advocates of indigenous rights have also criticized some of Toledo&#x27;s efforts to jump-start the economy through investments, such as his support for the Camisea natural gas project and other projects that involved exploring or developing natural resources. These critics claim that companies buy land at unreasonable prices, force indigenous people off of land that is historically theirs, and exploit natural resources in ways that are harmful to communities and the environment. Peru is one of the largest producers of gold, silver, and zinc in Latin America, and some critics complain about the priority the Peruvian government gives to mining as opposed to industries like fishing and agriculture, with which indigenous peoples are more familiar. They note that mining companies may bring new jobs to rural areas, but that they are not jobs for which natives are well qualified.

=== Labor unrest ===
Despite unprecedented, strong, and consistent economic growth under his leadership, Toledo dealt with much labor unrest during his presidency as workers demanded higher wages and the fulfillment of campaign promises. The crisis underlined a basic flaw in Peru&#x27;s economy as pointed out by &quot;The Economist&quot;, which noted that &quot;some 70% of output falls within the grey or &quot;informal&quot;&quot; economy, and thus escapes tax. Tax-collections, at below 12.1% of GDP, are stagnant, with most coming from a handful of large, formal companies. Evasion is widespread, particularly among better-paid independent professionals.&quot; Tax collections by Toledo&#x27;s government could simply not cover the wages that had been promised to civil servants.

Even as the Peruvian government was taking in too little money to pay civil servants, the country saw its cost of living increase dramatically during the early years of Toledo&#x27;s administration. These hardships, combined with increasing unemployment and stagnant wages caused the general public to doubt that Toledo was living up to lofty campaign promises. By 2003, Toledo&#x27;s approval rating had fallen below 10%, the lowest of any South American president at the time.

=== Social initiatives ===
Toledo did implement some of his plans for investment in social infrastructure and institutions. The amount of paved roads increased by 20% during his presidency; medical attention to the poor doubled in rural areas, and public sector salaries increased (school teachers&#x27; pay rose by 87%) and over 100,000 new homes were built for poor Peruvians.

By 2004, Peru had a far-reaching social safety net that included food programs serving 35 percent of the population, and work programs offering temporary employment to unskilled workers. The Cooperative Fund for Social Development funded projects to construct and improve schools, health clinics, rural roads, water and sanitation systems, and electric grids. Toledo placed food and infrastructure programs under the Ministry for Women and Social Development and urged that municipalities implement decentralization. Social safety-net spending in Peru remained well below the Latin American average under Toledo even as it covered a larger percentage of the population, which means that outlays were insufficient to lift many people up out of poverty.

==== Education ====
Toledo inherited an educational system which had been plagued for decades by mediocrity, low completion rates, inadequate resources, and inequality between genders, classes, and races. Toledo launched Project Huascaran, which enabled primary and secondary-school classrooms to connect a nationwide computer network of learning systems. During his campaign, Toledo had promised to double teachers’ salaries, but ran into problems when the teachers unions successfully opposed an initiative to tie salary increases to improved skills and performance standards.
In 2002, Toledo declared an emergency in education, stating four objectives to respond to it:
* Reverse the deterioration in quality of education
* Give priority to basic education
* emphasize teacher training and performance
* evaluate and upgrade schools
Throughout his administration, enrollment rates in primary and secondary education remained high and private-school enrollment increased, but overall literacy and test scores improved only slightly. In an interview on his last day in office, Toledo expressed frustration that his administration had not done more to improve education.

==== Healthcare ====
During his first year in office, Toledo replaced previous health-insurance programs aimed at the poor with a more comprehensive free insurance program, (SIS). The program aimed to provide Peruvians without health insurance with improved access to health care. By the end of his term, SIS covered more than 11 million Peruvians living on the outskirts of cities or in rural areas. However, about a third of the country remained without health coverage.

The program has been immensely popular. President García expanded the program, which has been praised by neoliberal reformers for extending coverage to indigenous people and women. They also note that it has addressed with considerable success the fact that Peruvian women&#x27;s healthcare costs are much higher than men&#x27;s owing to higher rates of illness and reproductive issues. The legislature continues to build upon SIS, using it as a basis for what many hope will someday be universal healthcare coverage for all Peruvians.

Toledo also attempted to improve access to healthcare in the most remote places. His Juntos program awarded a monthly benefit to poor families who agreed to get vaccinations and screenings, attend school, and obtain birth registration documents. The Toledo administration also provided financial incentives to young doctors who were willing to spend the first few years of their practices in remote areas.

==== Housing ====
Peru faced a major housing deficit in 2001, with the majority of its urban population living in slums. Toledo&#x27;s administration sought to improve access to affordable housing through subsidies, loans, down payments, land titling, and encouraging financial institutions to reach further down-market. Most of these efforts were grouped under the Fondo Mivivienda, which was a program started in 1999.

===Decentralization===

Under Toledo&#x27;s predecessor, Fujimori, the governing authority in Peru was condensed and centralized. A Fujimori-dominated congress passed a new constitution in 1993, which consolidated the bicameral legislature into a unicameral legislature with a single national district. Under Fujimori local governments retained minimal legal authority including fees for utilities, basic civil registries, and management of public spaces and markets.

Decentralization was among Toledo&#x27;s most successful institutional reforms. In addition to announcing regional elections upon his inauguration, he charged a Decentralization and Regionalization Commission with developing proposals. In 2002, a constitutional amendment was approved which established three levels of government: local, regional, and national. Over the next few years, the congress gradually passed on resources and responsibilities to the regional and municipal governments including food programs, social development projects, and health and education programs. He divided the single district up, called for regional elections, and eliminated the centralist Ministry of the Presidency that had been instituted under Fujimori. However, when Peru Possible&#x27;s rival political party APRA made significant gains in regional elections, the Toledo administration halted its decentralization program by withholding power in the areas of revenue and expenditure. This left many regionally elected governors confused as to how far their authority extended. Without strong fiscal plans to support his new policy of centralization, Toledo had to continue decentralizing power and recognizing more regions. Toledo continued to assert control of regional governments, however, by withholding funding.

Toledo&#x27;s plan for decentralization enjoyed widespread popular support. Most of the opposition to his program came from, and most of the difficulty in implementing his proposals was owing to, politicians and bureaucratic agencies who were accustomed to a centralized form of government.

===Fighting terrorism and drug trafficking===
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which had been implemented by interim president Paniagua, was tasked with examining largescale acts of violence and atrocities committed within Peru between 1980 and 2000, to assess responsibility and pave the way for reparations. The commission&#x27;s final report to President Toledo was issued in 2003, and concluded that approximately 69,000 people had been killed by the Shining Path and other extremist groups, the bulk of the victims being innocent peasants. In January of that year, the Constitutional Court repealed several anti-terrorism measures enacted during Fujimori&#x27;s administration. It was estimated that 54% of these victims were killed by the extremist guerrilla group Shining Path, 30% by the Peruvian Military and police forces, and the rest were by rural or peasant self-defense militias. These investigations were financed by a portion of the US$360 million discovered in foreign accounts which had been stolen by Fujimori officials. Toledo wasted no time in pursuing suspected terrorists, arresting 199 of them in 2002 alone.

In late 2001, the Directorate against Terrorism reported that the Shining Path, a terrorist movement which has been active since the eighties, was organizing along new fronts and infiltrating protests, blocking highways, and organizing student marches. The government reacted by reestablishing five counterinsurgency bases, which soon assisted in destroying six Shining Path camps. But terrorist activity continued and in 2003, Toledo declared the first of several states of emergency due to the terrorist threat.

Toledo walked a thin line in responding to both U.S. pressure to severely limit coca-production and protests by coca farmers against the eradication of coca production in poor, rural areas, where the majority of the population is involved in that business. The presumed link between the Shining Path and narcotics trafficking was unclear, because the coca farmers gave most of their crops to drug traffickers who then paid the Shining Path to operate within certain regions.

Recognizing the drug trade as a threat to regional security, Toledo sought to create a common Andean approach to the drug war. He saw that revenue from drug trafficking funded terrorist activities, but also that U.S. insistence on the eradication of coca crops failed to address the problem. Alternative crop programs were also being resisted by coca farmers who depended on the coca trade for their livelihood. At a meeting of the 19-member Rio group in May 2003, Toledo proposed developing a joint strategy to deal with drug trafficking, but pressure from Washington, which preferred bilateral efforts, helped kill the notion.

=== Foreign relations ===

The Toledo administration was unusually active in foreign policy. Its major goals were promoting democracy outside Peru, addressing the struggle against poverty, encouraging economic development in the borderlands, reducing arms spending in the region, strengthening relations with Asia-Pacific countries, and integrating with the Andean Community of Nations. Peru also became an associate member of MERCOSUR, a free trade zone that would be established gradually. The objective was for signing nations to gradually build up an infrastructure that would ease trade with one another, to cooperate in the improvement of energy efficiency, and to commit to future agreements that would increase cross border investment by eliminating double taxation.

====Asia====
The Toledo administration held free trade agreement talks with Singapore and Thailand, came to an agreement with Thailand on air transport, and signed an extradition treaty with South Korea. Foreign Minister García-Sayan visited China and discussed support for multilateralism and strengthening the UN. In 2004 China declared Peru an official tourist destination, and in 2005 the countries concluded several trade agreements.

====Bolivia====
Toledo attended Evo Morales’ inauguration in 2006, indicating a willingness to work with his administration, but Morales joined his mentor, Hugo Chávez, in repeatedly making offensive comments about Toledo and his government, especially after the successful conclusion of Peru&#x27;s free trade agreement with the U.S., which soured official relations with Colombia.

====Brazil====

In conducting Peru&#x27;s relations with Brazil, Toledo&#x27;s goal was to reorient Peru from the Andean Community, toward the more economically active Brazil and MERCOSUR. In August 2003, Toledo met with former Brazilian president Lula. They committed to increased political and economic cooperation under the Initiative for Integration of Regional Infrastructure in South America which invests in large-scale, debt-heavy projects, aimed at developing 10 economic axes or hubs throughout South America. Construction projects, including roads, discussed. President Lula also agreed to allow Peru access to two surveillance systems which Brazil had developed in the Amazon Basin to target legal and illegal activity.

====Colombia====
Concern for security and trafficking led the Toledo administration to prioritize the reinforcement of its border with Colombia and the improvement of police coordination. In 2003, with increased private and UN investment in the area, the two countries agreed to establish an integrated frontier zone which treats air travel between border cities as domestic travel and simplifies customs and tariff procedures.

====Chile====
Most of the Toledo administration&#x27;s dealings with Chile involved concern over the latters procurement of arms. Despite Toledo&#x27;s repeated call for regional arms reductions, Chile continued purchasing arms, including 10 F-16 fighters from the U.S. and one hundred Leopard 2 tanks from Germany.

====Ecuador====
While Peru and Ecuador had been at peace for years, President Toledo worked to solidify and build upon that peace. During a 2001 visit to Ecuador, Toledo expressed support for the Brasília Accords, agreed to the demilitarization of the two countries’ common border, advocated reduced military spending, and agreed to greater energy, transportation, and police cooperation. Toledo joined Ecuadorian President Noboa at the International Advisory Committee of the Binational Development Plan, where they called for greater investment in their region, with Toledo putting forth a detailed program for international assistance. Economic activity in the region subsequently improved as the demining of the border continued, construction projects were completed, and military forces were reduced. By 2006, investment in the area had reached $1.2 billion.

====Venezuela====

Relations with Venezuela deteriorated during the latter half of the Toledo presidency owing to opposing philosophies and policies of presidents Toledo and Chávez. The issues contributing to the tension between the two countries included Venezuela&#x27;s alleged shielding of Vladimiro Montesinos, and Venezuelan interference in Peruvian politics. (157) This included Chávez&#x27;s official endorsement, and unofficial financial backing of leftist candidate Ollanta Humala in Peru&#x27;s 2006 presidential race, which was soon seconded by President Morales.

====United States====
President Toledo worked hard throughout his presidency on what became a very productive relationship with the U.S., and what Toledo described as a personal friendship with President Bush. He received lavish praise from the American president for his economic and domestic security policies. During a visit to Peru, Bush announced the establishment of an Andean Center of Excellence for Teacher Training, with a base in Peru, and a fellowship program to give Andean professionals access to education in information technology. In June 2002, the U.S. agreed to forgive $14 million of Peru&#x27;s debt in exchange for a promise to invest $12 million in conservation projects. In September, Toledo secured a $300 million commitment from Bush to fund alternative-crop development in coca-producing areas. In 2003, the Peace Corps returned to Peru.
Peru opposed U.S. efforts most visibly in the War in Iraq, refusing to support the intervention in any international arena.

=====Peru – United States Trade Promotion Agreement=====
The &quot;United States – Peru Trade Promotion Agreement&quot; () is a bilateral free trade agreement, whose objectives are eliminating obstacles to trade, consolidating access to goods and services and fostering private investment in and between the United States and Peru. Besides commercial issues, it incorporates economic, institutional, intellectual property, labor and environmental policies, among others. The agreement was signed on 12 April 2006; ratified by the Peruvian Congress on 28 June 2006; by the U.S. House of Representatives on 2 November 2007, and by the U.S. Senate on 4 December 2007. The agreement was implemented on 1 February 2009.

Peru looks to the agreement are to:
*Consolidate and extend the trade preferences under ATPDEA
*Attract foreign investment
*Generate employment
*Enhance the country&#x27;s competitiveness within the region
*Increase workers&#x27; income
*Curb poverty levels
*Create and export sugar cane ethanol

The United States looks to the agreement to:
*Improve access to goods and services
*Strengthen its investments
*Promote security and democracy
*Fight against drug trafficking

The U.S.-Peru agreement has faced criticism. In Peru, the treaty was championed by Toledo, and supported to different extents by former President Alan García and candidates Lourdes Flores and Valentín Paniagua. Current President Ollanta Humala has been its most vocal critic. Humala&#x27;s Union for Peru won 45 of 120 seats in Congress in 2006, the largest share by a single party, prompting debate on ratification of the agreement before the new legislature was sworn in. Some Congressmen-elect interrupted the debate after forcibly entering Congress in an attempt to stop the agreement ratification.

One controversial element of the agreement relates to land resources. Laura Carlsen, of the Center for International Policy, who is also a contributor to Foreign Policy in Focus notes that &quot;Indigenous organizations warn that this ruling effectively opens up 45 million hectares to foreign investment and timber, oil, and mining exploitation.&quot;

However, most of the criticism of the agreement has focused on its potential impact on Peru&#x27;s agricultural sector. By planting crops to similar to those subsidized by the U.S., Peru faced a competitive disadvantage in the production of agricultural products because poor farming families with inadequate tools, technology and techniques may not be able to produce crops at low enough prices to export. In response to these concerns, Peruvian lawmakers created a Compensation Fund which directed $34 million per year to cotton, maize/corn, and wheat producers for a five-year period to help them adjust to the new competitive pressures.

=== Economic policy ===

Toledo&#x27;s economic policies can be described as neoliberal or strongly pro free-trade. He inherited a national economy which in the previous decade had experienced an unstable GDP with periods of growth and shrinkage, as well as fiscal deficits frequently amounting to over 2% of GDP. Inflation had not dropped below 23% until 1995 and was still feared by many. In response, Toledo developed policies which focused on fighting poverty, generating employment, decentralizing government, and modernizing the state.

Among Toledo&#x27;s initiatives designed to generate revenue and transform the economy were plans to privatize national industries. The first major effort of this kind was the $167 million sale of two state-owned electric companies. Protests in the city of Arequipa turned violent as Peruvians reacted with anger to the prospect of layoffs and higher priced electricity. They also recalled that billions of dollars earned from privatization under the Fujimori administration had ended up filling the president&#x27;s personal bank accounts. Toledo decided not to carry out the sale of electric companies, but promised to continue privatization efforts, which were a key provision of a deal struck with the International Monetary Fund. Toledo had promised to bring in US$700 million through privatization in 2001 and US$1 billion in 2002. Although he failed to meet these goals, the IMF approved a $154 million disbursement to Peru in December 2002 and allowed the country to raise the fiscal deficit target in its agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Americas Review 2003/2004&quot;&gt; Page, Kogan (2003)Americas Review 2003/2004, Retrieved May 2011. &lt;/ref&gt;

Although Toledo originally promised tax cuts, violent protests by civil servants prompted the increase in social sector spending that Toledo had also promised, which necessitated tax increases. To tackle tax reform in June 2003, he brought in Peru&#x27;s first female prime minister, Beatriz Merino who quickly submitted proposals to the congress. Among the suggestions were pay cuts for higher-paid public-sector officials, including a 30% salary reduction for Toledo himself, a 5% across-the-board cut for all agencies and ministries, tax increases on beer, cigarettes and fuel, and an extension of the 18% sales and value-added tax to, among other things, long-distance bus journeys and live entertainment. The final package also included the elimination of tax breaks, the introduction of a minimum corporate tax, the closing of tax loopholes for the rich, and the strengthening of local government realestate tax regimes.

During Toledo&#x27;s five years as president, Peru&#x27;s economy experienced 47 consecutive months of growth and grew at an average rate of 6% per year while inflation averaged 1.5% and the deficit sank as low as 0.2% of GDP. Between 2004 and 2006, employment grew at an average rate of 6%, the percentage of people living in poverty fell, and food consumption by the poorest segments of the population rose dramatically. Much of this growth has been credited to the free trade agreements signed with the United States, China, Thailand, Chile, Mexico, and Singapore.

In an attempt to increase remittances from Peruvians abroad, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs under Toledo sought to strengthen the link between Peruvian migrants and their homeland through the creation of advisory councils. The issue is especially important for a country which experienced a massive emigration of professionals under Fujimori and which still has 10% of its population living abroad. The councils were also part of an effort by the first Minister of Foreign Affairs, García Sayan, to professionalize the foreign service.

==Post-presidency (2006–present)==

Toledo was unable to run for reelection in 2006; after he took office, the constitution was amended to restore the pre-1995 ban on immediate reelection. After his presidency, Toledo went to the United States, where he served as a Distinguished Scholar in Residence at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, during the 2006–2008 academic years. Toledo was named a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University from 2006 to 2009, and in 2007–2008 was a Payne Distinguished Visiting Lecturer at Stanford University&#x27;s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and a CDDRL (Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law) Visiting Scholar. While at Stanford, Toledo founded and continues to serve as the president of the Global Center for Development and Democracy, based in Latin America, the United States, and the European Union which &#x27;aims to help Peru and Latin American countries build institutional bases for greater stability, with a wide political commitment to democracy, that is decentralized and equal to all&quot;.

In 2007, following the closing of media outlet RCTV in Venezuela, Toledo published an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; condemning the action of President Hugo Chávez&#x27;s government as a violation of free speech. Toledo called for intervention by the Organization of American States, citing its commitment to protecting the development of democratic institutions, including the press. He also called for &quot;continent-wide solidarity&quot; on the grounds that the repression of free speech in a country is felt beyond the country itself. He warned that if Venezuela were allowed to silence its press without repercussions, this would encourage similar repression in the rest of Latin America, because &quot;[w]hen one voice is silenced, we all become mute. When one thought is eliminated, we all lose some awareness. And when a space for the expression of ideas becomes closed, we all become trapped in the dungeons of dictatorship.&quot;

In 2009, Toledo joined the Brookings Institution as a nonresident senior fellow. His works on the Latin America Initiative, a joint effort of the Global Economy and Development and Foreign Policy programs at Brookings. The initiative focuses on the most critical economic, political and social issues facing the region. Research activities are concerned with a wide range of topics, including the challenges that a changing world economy poses for Latin America, the impact of organized crime on democratic institutions and economic prosperity, trade and investment policies, strategies to tackle poverty and inequality, combating climate change, and Cuba&#x27;s political transition.

Toledo is also a member of the United Nations Steering Committee on the Human Development Report for Latin America, a member of the Club of Madrid, and a member of the International Board of Governors of the Peres Center for Peace in Israel.

Toledo attended the San Francisco Freedom Forum in 2011 to discuss democracy in Latin America.

Toledo created the Global Center for Development and Democracy. The center works with low income individuals in developing countries with the goal of helping them become self-sufficient entrepreneurs, along with governments and other organizations to help combat institutionalized poverty.

=== Friends of Israel Initiative ===
In 2010, Toledo joined the Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar, Northern Irish Unionist politician David Trimble, Italian philosopher Marcello Pera, former United States Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, British historian Andrew Roberts, and others in forming the Friends of Israel Initiative. The project&#x27;s aim is to counter efforts to delegitimize the State of Israel and its right to live in peace within safe and defensible borders. The initiative consists of non-Jewish members who want Israel to continue to be accepted as part of the western world and who recognize it as a full-fledged democracy with the right to defend itself.

In a 2011 article entitled &quot;How Not to have a Palestinian State,&quot; Toledo and his co-writers argued that Obama&#x27;s call for a return to talks based on the pre-1967 boundaries is a &quot;clumsily concealed delegitimization device,&quot; as Palestine does not meet the internal and external requirements to become a state. The only way forward, the argued, is not unilateral action by the UN General assembly but a bilateral agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis, in which each party agrees to recognize the other as a legitimate state.

=== 2011 Election ===

In December 2010, Toledo announced his candidacy in the 2011 presidential election. Telling the &quot;Peruvian Times&quot; that &quot;Garcia (the incumbent) is governing for the rich and not the poor&quot;, he said that when he left office, with 1 sol (approximately $0.34) bought 10 loaves bread; now it bought you five. &quot;President Alan García (must) realize that Peru is much greater, much deeper, more generous and more warlike than the rich friends that surround him.&quot;

The general election, which took place on 10 April 2011, Toledo won 15.62% of the vote putting him behind leftist former army officer Ollanta Humala (with 31.75%), Keiko Fujimori, daughter of the former president (with 23.5%), and Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (with 18.52%), and ahead of Luis Castaneda (with 9.84%). After the initial round, Fujimori received the support of candidate and former president Alan García, while Toledo supported Humala, calling him the lesser of two evils.

However, Toledo&#x27;s support came with conditions, and he threatened to mobilize protests if Humala&#x27;s presidency did not live up to Toledo&#x27;s standards in terms of protecting democratic institutions, human rights, and stimulating the economy. Just before the election, an email was released revealing that the socialist president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, had given financial support to Humala&#x27;s 2006 campaign. It also emerged that Humala&#x27;s wife, Nadine Heredia, had been well-paid for consulting work at a pro-Chávez newspaper.

In the final tally, Humala won 51.6% of the vote to Fujimori&#x27;s 48.4%. The day after the final vote, the Peruvian stock market plunged out of concern for the state of Peru&#x27;s neo-liberal economic policies.

Drawing on his close relations with Evo Morales, President-elect Humala visited Bolivia shortly after the election and suggested the possibility of reunification of the two countries, a proposal which Toledo explicitly rejected, warning that he would not &quot;allow Peru to become another Venezuela or Nicaragua.&quot;

Amidst worries that Humala&#x27;s election represented a shift too far to the left, Peru Posible, under the leadership of Toledo, announced the month after the election that its members would not accept ministerial positions within the administration and would limit its support of Humala&#x27;s government to backing on some issues in the Congress.

===Lawsuit over corruption allegations===

In April 2016, Toledo was summoned to court on charges of money laundering over the purchase of several properties via Ecoteva Consulting, a real estate company owned by Israeli businessman Yossi Maiman. Toledo is accused of taking bribes from the Brazilian companies Camargo Corrêa and Odebrecht for the construction of the Interoceanic Highway, and using the money to pay off personal mortgages and buy luxury real estate in the name of his mother in law. In 2015, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority said the money went from Confiado International Corp, a Panama-based company, to Costa Rica. Meanwhile, Maiman denied the allegations, comparing them to a &quot;smear campaign&quot;. 

In 2016, Odebrecht stated as part of a plea agreement that the company had paid approximately $800 million in bribes in several Latin American countries, including $29 million in Peru from 2001 to 2006, the presidencies of Toledo and his two successors, all of whom have denied the charge of receiving bribes. On 9 February 2017, a Peruvian judge ordered Toledo&#x27;s arrest over allegations that he took $20m (£16m) in bribes from Odebrecht in return for awarding public works contracts, a reward was offered for his capture, and Interpol was alerted. 

Toledo was arrested by US authorities in July 2019 after a formal request by Peru for his extradition. He was released on bail in 2020 and was living in California. On 20 April 2023, federal judge Beryl Howell denied his last motion to delay his extradition and ordered his arrest.

On 21 April 2023, Toledo surrendered himself to US authorities in San Mateo, California. On 23 April 2023, Toledo was extradited to Peru, where he was transferred to Peruvian police.

On 21 October 2024, Toledo was sentenced to 20 years&#x27; imprisonment by the National Superior Court of Specialized Criminal Justice for taking bribes as part of the Odebrecht case.

== Relationship with the press ==
From the beginning of Toledo&#x27;s presidency, the press took an aggressive stance, scrutinizing the personal and public lives of Toledo and his advisors. Many news outlets were determined to expose corruption. Others wished to prove their independence from the government. Ironically, it was Toledo&#x27;s commitment to maintaining a free press that allowed these attacks to occur.

Charges of corruption, nepotism, and graft aimed at Toledo, his family, members of his administration and fellow PP members plagued his presidency. These stories led to many resignations and were the most significant reason for Toledo&#x27;s low approval ratings. Those ratings bottomed out in 2004, following the resignation of his Minister of Agriculture.

==Awards and honors==
On 7 May 2005, he received the Order of the Athir, one of the National Order of Merits of Algeria.

In 2006, UCSD&#x27;s Institute of the Americas honored President Toledo with its Award for Democracy and Peace for his efforts in promoting economic growth and strengthening democracy. &quot;It is the force of his personality that has led this country to understand that in this globalized world, there is no alternative to regional integration, to free trade, to sane economic policies,&quot; said Jeffrey Davidow, the institute&#x27;s president.

Toledo has received honorary doctorates from University of Winnipeg, Los Andes Peruvian University, and 50 other universities around the world—for a total of 52. He has lectured in more than thirty countries on issues of poverty, economic growth, and democracy, as well as on the benefits of human-capital investment.

28 July 2011, was the tenth anniversary of Toledo&#x27;s inauguration, an event catalogued in the Associated Press&#x27;s &quot;Highlights in History&quot; for that day.

In October 2011, Tbilisi State University awarded an honorary doctorate to Toledo &quot;for his special role in establishing and developing relations between Peru and Georgia.&quot;

Despite the largely negative press coverage of his presidency, many of Toledo&#x27;s harshest critics recognize the high premium that Toledo put on democratic processes and safeguards. In recognition of his efforts to preserve the freedom of the press Enrique Zileri, President of the Peruvian Press Council, affirmed in May 2003 that there were no problems with press freedom in Peru.

Toledo received the Grand Cross of the Order of Saint-Charles from Monaco in 2003.

<text>Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars is a 1996 role-playing video game developed by Square and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It was the final &quot;Mario&quot; game for the SNES. The game was directed by Chihiro Fujioka and Yoshihiko Maekawa, produced by Shigeru Miyamoto, and scored by Yoko Shimomura.

&quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; story focuses on Mario and his friends as they seek to defeat the Smithy Gang, who have crashed into their world and scattered the seven star pieces of Star Road. It is the first RPG in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise, drawing from major elements of Square&#x27;s RPG franchises such as &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. The main form of fighting enemies is turn-based combat with a party of up to three characters. It is also the first game in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise to have gameplay within an isometric 3D environment, allowing for a new variety of the exploration and platforming elements reminiscent of the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series.

&quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; was acclaimed, particularly for its humor and 3D-rendered graphics. It was released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console service in 2008, marking its debut in Europe and Australia, and for the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2015. It was also included with the Super NES Classic Edition in 2017. A remake developed by ArtePiazza for the Nintendo Switch was released in 2023 and received positive reviews. &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; was followed by the &quot;Mario&quot; RPG series &quot;Paper Mario&quot; and &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot;, which retain some gameplay elements.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; contains token similarities to other Square-developed video games, such as the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, along with a story and gameplay based on the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; series of platform games. Like most traditional JRPGs, the two main sections of the game are adventuring and turn-based battle sequences. Much of &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot;″s gameplay is outside monster battles and plays like an isometric 3D platformer, in which traditional &quot;Mario&quot; elements such as punching floating question blocks from below are prominent. There are no random encounters and as such enemies are visible in the field; a battle ensues only if Mario comes in contact with one. This allows the player to evade unnecessary battles.

The player&#x27;s party initially begins with only Mario and grows to five characters. Mario and up to two other members participate in battles, who can be swapped in and out while the player explores the overworld. Each of the five characters has a unique set of attacks and techniques. For example, Princess Toadstool&#x27;s abilities are primarily healing techniques, whereas Geno and Bowser have offensive attacks that deal high amounts of damage. The combat is based on a traditional turn-based battle system with the addition of action commands that amplify a move&#x27;s effects. The player starts each turn by choosing to attack, defend, run, use an item, or perform magic from the combat menu. The action command consists of timed button presses during an attack, special move, defense, or item usage, which became a mainstay of later &quot;Mario&quot; RPGs.

== Story ==
=== Characters and setting ===
The game world is set in a geographically diverse land, which includes mountains, forests, and bodies of water. Each region has distinct characteristics held by its inhabitants; Mushroom Kingdom is inhabited by Toads, Moleville is inhabited by moles, Monstro Town is populated by reformed monsters, Yo&#x27;ster Isle is where Yoshi and his eponymous species reside, and Nimbus Land is an area inhabited by cloud people. Bowser&#x27;s Castle is another prominent location in the game, as it holds the portal to the Smithy Gang&#x27;s homeworld.

As in most &quot;Super Mario&quot; games, the main protagonist is Mario, whose initial goal is to rescue Princess Toadstool from Bowser. Soon after the start of his journey, the Smithy Gang, the main antagonists of the game, invades Mario&#x27;s world. While attempting to stop the group, Mario is joined by Mallow, a cloud boy who thinks he is a tadpole; Geno, a doll possessed by a celestial spirit from the Star Road; Bowser, whose armies have deserted him out of fear of the Smithy Gang; and Princess Toadstool, who was lost in the turmoil that occurred when the Smithy Gang arrived. The Smithy Gang is led by Smithy, a robotic blacksmith from another world with aspirations of world domination.

=== Plot ===
One day, Mario sets out once again to rescue Princess Toadstool from Bowser at his castle. During their battle, a giant living sword named Exor falls from the sky, breaks through the Star Road (a pathway that helps grant people&#x27;s wishes), and crashes into Bowser&#x27;s castle, sending Mario, Princess Toadstool, and Bowser flying in different directions, as well as scattering the seven-star fragments. Mario lands back at his pad and meets up with Toad, who tells him he has to rescue Toadstool. Mario returns to Bowser&#x27;s castle, but Exor destroys the bridge, preventing him from entering. Mario makes his way to the Mushroom Kingdom, where Mario encounters a &quot;tadpole&quot; named Mallow who has set out to retrieve a frog coin taken by the local thief Croco. After Mario helps him retrieve the frog coin, they return to the Mushroom Kingdom to find that it is overrun by the Smithy Gang, followers of the evil robotic blacksmith king named Smithy. Mario and Mallow enter the castle to defeat their lieutenant, Mack, and subsequently find a mysterious Star Piece. Mallow accompanies Mario to Tadpole Pond so they can get advice from Frogfucius, Mallow&#x27;s grandfather. He reveals that Mallow is not really a tadpole, and says Mallow should join Mario on a quest to find the seven Star Pieces as well as Mallow&#x27;s real parents.

The duo travel to Rose Town where they meet a star spirit who has animated and taken control of a wooden doll named Geno. After battling the bow-like creature Bowyer, who is immobilizing residents of Rose Town with his arrows, they retrieve another Star Piece. Geno joins Mario and reveals to him the Star Piece is a part of the shattered Star Road, where he normally resides. Geno has been tasked with repairing the Star Road and defeating Smithy, so that the world&#x27;s wishes may again be heard. The trio retrieve the third star piece then head to Booster Tower, the home of the eccentric amusement-venue owner, Booster, where they encounter Bowser, whose minions have all deserted him. Bowser reluctantly asks Mario to help him to reclaim his castle; Mario agrees, allowing Bowser to save face by pretending he is joining the Koopa Troop, and Bowser joins the party. The new team intercepts Princess Toadstool just before she is forcibly married to Booster, but it turns out that the wedding wasn&#x27;t real; Booster, having no idea what a marriage actually is, just thought it was a fun party and abruptly returns home after devouring the cake.

After her rescue, the princess returns home to Mushroom Kingdom only to then decide to join the party while her grandmother takes her place in disguise. After recovering two more star pieces, they search Nimbus Land. A statue maker, Garro, informs them that Valentina has the rulers of Nimbus Land being held captive, and her sidekick Dodo is impersonating the prince so he can make Valentina queen. Garro recognizes Mallow as the true prince, then disguises Mario as a statue to infiltrate the castle. There they defeat Valentina and Dodo and liberate Mallow’s parents, the King and Queen.

After traveling to Barrel Volcano to obtain the sixth Star Piece, Mario&#x27;s party learns that the final piece must be held by Smithy in Bowser&#x27;s castle. They battle their way through the assembled enemies to enter the castle, where they discover that Exor is actually a gateway to Smithy&#x27;s factory, the place where Smithy mass-produces his army. Mario and company cross over, find the heart of the factory, and defeat Smithy, thereby stopping his army creation and causing Exor to disappear. The collected Star Pieces are used to repair the Star Road, Geno returns to the Star Road, Bowser rebuilds his castle with his newly reformed army, Mallow regains his rightful title as prince of Nimbus Land, and Mario and Princess Toadstool return to the Mushroom Kingdom to celebrate their victory.

== Development ==
According to Yoshio Hongo of Nintendo, &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; came out of Shigeru Miyamoto&#x27;s desire to make an RPG game using Mario, plus Square&#x27;s desire to develop an RPG that could do better outside of Japan than their previous games. Development began in early 1994 after a business meeting between Nintendo and Square. The first phase was spent on deciding a basic system, while the isometric view was chosen to help bring the world to life. To help the game fit with the &quot;Mario&quot; series, it was made to be more action- and movement-focused compared to Square&#x27;s other RPGs. Development began in earnest during the second quarter of 1995, when the programming, story events, and graphics data were being implemented.

The game was officially unveiled by both Mario creator and producer Shigeru Miyamoto and co-director Chihiro Fujioka at the 1995 V-Jump Festival event in Japan. Miyamoto led teams at Nintendo and Square, who spent over a year developing the graphics. The story takes place in a newly rendered Mushroom Kingdom based on the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; series. Square reported that the game was about 70% complete in October 1995. The developers created the interior elements such as columns, stairways, and exterior elements with advanced computer modeling techniques. Special lighting effects were used to create shadows and reflections that were meant to improve the 3D elements. Shinya Takahashi, who would later become head of Nintendo SPD and Nintendo EPD, designed the game&#x27;s CG models. With guidance from Miyamoto, Square developed the game, combining role-playing aspects of previous Square games like &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; with the platforming elements of Nintendo&#x27;s games. Square&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series was the model for the battle sequences, while the tradition of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; games demanded a lot of action. Mario&#x27;s ability to jog in eight directions and jump up or down in a three–quarter perspective gave him a (comparatively) large range of motion. At 70% completion, the mix of adventure and action gameplay elements placed it in a category closer to &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot;.

When Nintendo of America received a 60% complete version in November, the staff were surprised at the inclusion of an RPG battle system. The battle screens, using pre-rendered sprites as in the rest of the game, included attack animations of equipped weapons. In December, further development and improvements to the gameplay delayed the translation of the game. For example, the Chancellor, who was named the Mushroom Retainer in Japan, was called the &quot;Minister&quot; in North America. Plans continued through February for the North American version, changing the release date forecast from winter to spring.

The game&#x27;s soundtrack was composed by Yoko Shimomura, who incorporated arrangements of music by Koji Kondo from &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, and three tracks by Nobuo Uematsu from &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;. She regards the &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; score as one of the turning points in her career. On March 25, 1996, NTT Publishing released a two-disc soundtrack album, &quot;Super Mario RPG Original Sound Version&quot;.

&quot;Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars&quot; is one of only seven SNES games released outside Japan to use the Nintendo SA-1 chip. Compared with standard SNES games, the additional microprocessor allows these features: higher clock speeds; faster access to the random-access memory (RAM); greater memory mapping capabilities, data storage, and compression; new direct memory access (DMA) modes, such as bitmap to bit plane transfer; and built-in CIC lockout for piracy protection and regional marketing control. It was originally not released in the PAL region; Nintendo representatives cited the need to optimize the game for PAL televisions and translate it into multiple languages.

== Release ==
In Japan, &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; sold 1.47 million copies, making it the third highest-selling game in Japan in 1996. Its sales in the United States surpassed Nintendo&#x27;s expectations. For the release in the middle of May 1996, Nintendo shipped 300,000 copies to retailers; Nintendo estimated sell-through of more than 200,000 units within one month on shelves. A company representative said that it was &quot;on track to easily exceed our 500,000 target, and it may easily become a one million seller by the end of this calendar year&quot;. By August 24, it had been the most-rented game in the United States for 14 weeks straight. It became the sixth-best-selling game of 1996 in the United States.

&quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; was the last SNES game released by Square in America, with &quot;Treasure of the Rudras&quot; and &quot;Treasure Hunter G&quot; as the last games released in Japan. &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; was released on Virtual Console for Wii in Japan on June 24, 2008. It was released for the first time in Europe and Australia on August 22, 2008 on Virtual Console for Wii, as part of the third Hanabi Festival (a period in which several games not previously available in Europe are released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console). It was released on Virtual Console for Wii in North America on September 1, 2008, with the distinction of being the 250th Virtual Console game released in that region. &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; was released on Virtual Console for Wii U in Japan on August 5, 2015, in Europe and Australia on December 24, 2015, and in North America on June 30, 2016. It was also packed into the Super NES Classic Edition in 2017. A remake for Nintendo Switch was released worldwide on November 17, 2023.

== Remake ==
A remake of &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; was announced for the Nintendo Switch in June 2023 and released on November 17, 2023. It was developed in the Unity engine by ArtePiazza, which had previously worked on games in Square Enix&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series. It features full 3D graphics, updated character and enemy names, with Princess Toadstool being called Princess Peach to reflect her modern nomenclature and Frogfucius being renamed Frog Sage, and the option to switch between the original music and a newly arranged soundtrack by Shimomura. New battle mechanics include the option to swap party members (except for Mario) in the middle of battle, the ability to damage all enemies when performing perfect action commands, and powerful team-specific &quot;triple moves&quot; performed after building a gauge using successful action commands. Other additions include an easier difficulty setting, a bestiary to view enemies the player has encountered, and post-game content, including a sound player and more difficult boss rematches. 

According to the review aggregrator website Metacritic, it received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; with an aggregate rating of 84, and 96% of critics recommend it on OpenCritic. As of March 31, 2024, the game has sold 3.31 million copies, with 860,000 sold in Japan, and 2.45 million internationally.

== Reception ==
&quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; received positive reviews. Though its battle system and characters were criticized by a few critics, it garnered praise for its graphics and for humor in particular. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s review commented that the &quot;excellent&quot; 3D graphics helped the game appeal to a much wider audience than most traditional RPGs. In March 1997, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; nominated the game for several awards, including &quot;Best Graphics&quot;, in a player&#x27;s choice contest, though &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; won &quot;Best Graphics&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; praised the graphics, stating that they are &quot;the best seen on the Super NES&quot;. Scary Larry of &quot;GamePro&quot; gave the game a perfect 5/5 in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and fun factor), and praised the rendered enemies, cinematics, and spell animations.

&quot;1UP.com&quot; stated that the graphic element is &quot;strong enough to resemble a &quot;Mario&quot; title but still retains the role-playing theme at the same time&quot;, and &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; commented that the visuals are &quot;typical of Nintendo, using clean and colorful graphics along with nice animation&quot;. &quot;RPGamer&quot; editor Derek Cavin called the backgrounds &quot;beautiful&quot; and stated that they &quot;perfectly bring the Mushroom Kingdom and surrounding areas into 3D&quot;. Skyler Miller from &quot;Allgame&quot; stated that the graphics are &quot;absolutely outstanding, with colorful, 3D rendered visuals that once seemed impossible on the Super NES. This is definitely the high watermark for 3D graphics on any 16-bit system&quot;. The editor also called the music &quot;quite extraordinary&quot; and that the songs &quot;match the mood of the surrounding environment&quot;. In the Virtual Console re-release, &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Lucas Thomas&#x27;s review of &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; stated that the game&#x27;s experience &quot;completes itself with a compelling story, a humorous attitude and a variety of interspersed mini-games that break up the adventuring action&quot;. The publication also stated that the soundtrack is &quot;spectacular and a joy to listen to&quot; and the graphics &quot;took full advantage of the system&#x27;s 16-bit technology and looks great&quot;.

Cavin said that most of the battle system mechanics &quot;aren&#x27;t very original&quot; and also criticized the &quot;lack of a unified storyline&quot;. In contrast, a reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; found that the battle system refreshingly differed from tradition, and was pleased that &quot;the elements that stand out from the traditional formula are those that make this a recognizable &quot;Mario&quot; game.&quot; He wrote that the gameplay was complex enough to challenge even veteran RPG gamers, yet simple enough to not alienate newcomers to the genre. Scary Larry similarly said the game &quot;should please diehard RPG fans as well as novice players&quot;, as it is genuinely tough and offers considerable replay value in the form of sidequests and bonus features such as Toadofsky&#x27;s music levels. He also found Squaresoft&#x27;s signature humor and puzzle-solving to be as exceptional as usual. Miller commented that after engaging in many battles, &quot;the battle music becomes monotonous&quot; and that after the game is beaten, &quot;There aren&#x27;t any surprises to be discovered the second time around&quot;. While &quot;1UP.com&quot; wrote that the characters were &quot;too childish for older gamers&quot;, &quot;Next Generation&quot; said the game is &quot;held together by the strength of its characters and well-developed world&quot;.

In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ranked the game 34th on a list of greatest Nintendo games. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; editors named &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; a runner-up for both Super NES Game of the Year (behind &quot;Tetris Attack&quot;) and Role-Playing Game of the Year (behind &quot;Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain&quot;). In 2018, Complex ranked the game 8th on their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time.&quot; In 2023, &quot;Time Extension&quot; included the game on their &quot;Best JRPGs of All Time&quot; list.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; appeared on reader-selected &quot;best game of all time&quot; lists, such as 30th at &quot;IGN&quot;, and critic-selected &quot;best games of all time&quot; lists, such as 26th in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;.

&quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; does not have a direct sequel but it established conventions for its thematic and spiritual successors, the &quot;Paper Mario&quot; series and &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot; series. Nintendo announced a game titled &quot;Super Mario RPG 2&quot; for 64DD, which was renamed &quot;Paper Mario&quot; before its release on the Nintendo 64. Themes shared with the original include the use of Flower Points as a shared party resource instead of each character having their own pool of Magic Points, timed action commands during battles, and the collection of seven stars.

Fujioka and Maekawa went on to work at AlphaDream and worked on the &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot; series. Yoko Shimomura returned, having composed the soundtrack for every game. &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga&quot; features a cameo of Geno in one of the minigames, and the end credits mention Square Enix as the copyright holder of the character; this cameo was removed for the game&#x27;s Nintendo 3DS remake.

Various locations and characters from the game appear in the children&#x27;s book &quot;Mario and the Incredible Rescue&quot; released by Scholastic in 2006. Though his only starring role in a video game was in &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot;, Masahiro Sakurai added the fan-favorite character Geno as a Mii Fighter costume to the crossover fighting game series &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; as paid downloadable content, attributing his inclusion to his matching arm cannon. &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; is among the 21 preinstalled games on the Super NES Classic Edition in all regions, released in September 2017.

<text>Paper Mario is a 2000 role-playing video game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 home video game console. &quot;Paper Mario&quot; is the first game in the &quot;Paper Mario&quot; series. First released in Japan in 2000 and then internationally in 2001, &quot;Paper Mario&quot; was later re-released for Nintendo&#x27;s Wii Virtual Console in July 2007, the Wii U Virtual Console in April 2015, and the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on December 10, 2021.

&quot;Paper Mario&quot; is set in the Mushroom Kingdom as the protagonist Mario tries to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser, who has imprisoned the seven &quot;Star Spirits&quot;, lifted her castle into the sky and has defeated Mario after stealing the Star Rod from Star Haven and making himself . To save the Mushroom Kingdom, rescue Peach, get the castle back, and defeat Bowser, Mario must locate the Star Spirits, who can negate the effects of the stolen Star Rod, by defeating Bowser&#x27;s minions guarding the star spirits. The player controls Mario and a number of partners to solve puzzles in the game&#x27;s overworld and defeat enemies in a turn-based battle system. The battles are unique in that the player can influence the effectiveness of attacks by performing required controller inputs known as &quot;action commands&quot;.

Although Nintendo planned to have Square, now Square Enix, develop &quot;Paper Mario&quot;, the company was occupied with developing &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; for the PlayStation; Intelligent Systems developed the game instead. The game received acclaim, being praised for its concept, battle system, and graphics, and was rated the 63rd best game made on a Nintendo system in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s &quot;Top 200 Games&quot; list in 2006. It was followed by a line of sequels, starting with &quot;Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&quot; for the GameCube in 2004.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Paper Mario&quot; combines traditional role-playing game (RPG) elements with concepts and features from the &quot;Mario&quot; series. For the majority of the game, the player controls Mario, who can jump and use his hammer to overcome physical obstacles placed in the game&#x27;s overworld. Many of the game&#x27;s puzzles and boundaries are based upon the abilities of Mario&#x27;s partners, who each have a specialized skill required for progression in the game. The player accumulates partners as they advance into different locations; only one partner can accompany Mario in the overworld, although the player can interchange them at any time.

These characters also assist Mario in the game&#x27;s turn-based battles, where the damage inflicted against them results in temporary paralysis as the characters do not have individual HP statistics. Attacks in the game are similar to those in traditional RPGs, although the player can influence the power of a move when attacking or defending by timing a button-press accurately or performing some other action command as required. Mario and his partners have a finite capacity to perform special moves, with each of these consuming a particular number of flower points (FP) when performed. Such statistics can be increased by earning Star Points (experience points) in combat to level up. There is also an on-screen gauge to display Star Energy, which is required to perform another type of move that accumulates in number as the player advances through the game. The player can locate hidden battle upgrades in the game&#x27;s overworld, which promotes one partner character to a new rank at a time.

Progression through &quot;Paper Mario&quot; depends upon interaction with the game&#x27;s non-player characters (NPCs), who would often offer clues or detail the next event in the storyline. As in other RPGs, the player can find or purchase items from NPCs to help in and outside of combat. Badges can also be obtained that yield bonuses ranging from added moves to gradual health restoration during combat; each consumes a set number of Badge Points (BP), meaning Mario can only equip a limited number of badges at a time. Princess Peach is playable at particular points in the game as a recurring quest line. The objectives and actions of each transition to Peach vary, although most are stealth-based.

== Plot and setting ==
Set in the Mushroom Kingdom, the game begins when Mario and Luigi receive an invitation from Peach for a party at the castle. There, when Mario and Peach are alone, Bowser lifts her castle, overpowers Mario with his invincibility that he gained by stealing the Star Rod and imprisoning the seven Star Spirits; Mario is thrown away from the castle in the sky and lands in Goomba Village, where he is aided by Goombario and his family. Mario and Goombario make their way to Shooting Star Summit, where the weakened seven Star Spirits&#x27; request Mario to find them in order to stop Bowser&#x27;s invincibility. Mario and his friends go to the four Koopa Bros.&#x27; fortress where they save the first Star Spirit. and they find the second one in the Dry, Dry Desert inside a secret fortress ruled over by Tutankoopa. The third one is being kept by Tubba Blubba, a nemesis scaring the Boos and eating them when he is &quot;invincible&quot; (his heart is his true weak point). The fourth one is kept by the General Guy and his minions living in the Toy Box. Mario and his new friends travel to Lavalava Land, an island where its inhabitants are threatened by an impending volcanic eruption. After saving the fifth Spirit, they journey to Flower Fields retrieving the sixth one. Mario becomes a suspect of murder when he finds the Shiver City&#x27;s mayor unconscious; after solving the mystery (which was the mayor&#x27;s own accident), Mario gets to the Crystal Palace where he saves the last Star Spirit from the Crystal King. As he has saved every Star Spirit, Mario then departs to Peach&#x27;s Castle.

Meanwhile, Peach tries in numerous attempts to escape the castle alongside Twink. The player controls Peach in a variety of minigames each time Mario saves
a Star Spirit, such as baking a cake for a Shy Guy or even cloning the appearance of Bowser&#x27;s minions with a magic umbrella. At the end of every gameplay segment with Peach, she overhears Bowser speaking about the bosses Mario beats before being discovered and then transported to her room again.

Mario enters the castle and confronts Bowser; with the power of the seven Star Spirits, Mario manages to beat Bowser by stopping his invincibility while Twink, with support from Peach, battles Bowser&#x27;s sidekick Kammy Koopa. Mario and Peach, alongside their friends, eventually win against Bowser and Kammy. The Star Spirits restore the castle to its spot. On another day, Mario and Luigi receives a letter for another party, which lead to a parade as the game&#x27;s credits rolls, and Mario and Peach watch fireworks together at his home.

=== Story and characters ===
The game&#x27;s story centers on Mario as he tries to reclaim the seven Star Spirits, who have been sealed in playing cards by Bowser and his assistant, Kammy Koopa. Their combined power is required to negate the effects of the Star Rod, which makes Bowser invincible. Once Mario rescues all of them, he uses their assistance to defeat Bowser and rescue Peach. The story is presented in the context of a novel, with each adventure involving the rescue of a Star Spirit denoted as a single chapter. Peach is playable between chapters, where she allies with a star kid named Twink in the castle to relay vital information to Mario regarding his quest.

Mario allies with eight partners in total, each of whom represents a different type of enemy from the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise. These allies are:
* Goombario, a Goomba who has the ability to tell the player about any character, environment, and enemy;
* Kooper, a Koopa Troopa with the ability to throw his shell at otherwise unreachable objects;
* Bombette, a Bob-omb with the ability to blow up weak parts of walls;
* Parakarry, a Paratroopa with the ability to help Mario cross gaps too large to jump across;
* Lady Bow, a Boo with the ability to make Mario become invisible and transparent;
* Watt, a Li&#x27;l Sparky with the ability to light up rooms and reveal hidden objects;
* Sushie, a Cheep Cheep with the ability to allow Mario to swim;
* and Lakilester, a Lakitu with the ability to allow Mario to traverse dangerous environments, such as spikes and lava.

After Peach&#x27;s castle is sent back to the ground and Mario defeats Bowser, he recounts his tale to Luigi, who had remained at home while Mario went on the adventure. Peach throws a huge party to honor Mario and his allies for saving the entire kingdom, which is then followed by a parade during the credits.

== Development ==
&quot;Paper Mario&quot; was developed by Intelligent Systems. Shigeru Miyamoto served as producer and consulted on the project. Kumiko Takeda and Kaori Aoki wrote the game&#x27;s script, while Naohiko Aoyama was the art director responsible for the game&#x27;s distinctive graphical style. Nintendo approached Square, who had developed &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, to develop the game, but they turned down the offer due to work on &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. Instead, the company initially hired HAL Laboratory to write the main story before development was handed over to Intelligent Systems to develop the game. The game was initially called &quot;Super Mario RPG 2&quot;, was slated for release on the 64DD, and was first revealed at Nintendo Space World &#x27;97, a video game trade show hosted by Nintendo. However, the development moved to cartridge format instead. Aoyama took inspiration from the graphics of &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot;, cel animation, and the work of Walt Disney and &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; for the art style. According to producer Hiroyasu Sasano, the series&#x27; distinct paper-like style for character graphics came about from the belief that players &quot;might be getting tired&quot; of the computer-generated 3D graphics seen on consoles like the PlayStation as it was difficult for polygons to bring out the characters&#x27; &quot;cuteness&quot;. Miyamoto stated that the game was being developed with amateur gamers in mind. The game later released for the iQue Player in 2004. &quot;Paper Mario&quot; saw a number of re-releases for later Nintendo consoles: the Wii Virtual Console in July 2007, the Wii U Virtual Console in April 2015, and via the Nintendo Switch Online service in December 2021. In 2023, &quot;Paper Mario&quot; was fully decompiled, making an unofficial PC port and mods possible.

The game had a marketing budget of $4 million.

=== Music ===
The game&#x27;s soundtrack was first released in Japan on September 21, 2000, with the game&#x27;s original title by Enterbrain, and distributed by the magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot;. It was followed in the United States a few months later as a Nintendo Power exclusive with the illustration from the international game cover. It included both the original music to the game, as well as sound effects, in 78 tracks on two discs. All of the game&#x27;s compositions were written by Yuka Tsujiyoko, with a reprised arrangement of previous &quot;Super Mario&quot; themes by Koji Kondo. The game&#x27;s other event and sound effects music were composed by Taishi Senda. The game&#x27;s music mostly received positive reviews, with Lucas M. Thomas of IGN describing it as &quot;vividly appointed with catchy, expressive tunes and comical audio cues.&quot;

== Reception and legacy ==
&quot;Paper Mario&quot; received critical acclaim, receiving a 93/100 on review aggregator Metacritic based on 15 reviews. The game was the top-selling game in Japan on the week of its release, selling more than 276,000 copies, and the top-selling game for two weeks in other regions. It was ranked #141 on &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Greatest 200 Videogames of their Time&quot; in February 2006, the 63rd best game made on a Nintendo system in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s &quot;Top 200 Games&quot; list, and the 13th greatest Nintendo 64 game of all time by the same magazine. It currently ranks as the sixth-highest scoring Nintendo 64 game on Metacritic, the ninth highest rated video game of 2001, and the highest-scoring Nintendo 64 game released that year.

&quot;IGN&quot;″s Matt Casamassina praised the game&#x27;s accessibility, commenting that &quot;it serves as the perfect introductory game to any person hoping to explore the genre&quot;. Nonetheless, other reviewers complained about the &quot;brain-dead easy&quot; puzzles and bosses requiring &quot;basic strategy at best&quot;. The game&#x27;s nostalgic value was lauded, with reviewers noting the sense of familiarity with the &quot;Mario&quot; series present in the game&#x27;s settings and characters. The game has often been compared to the previous Mario RPG title, &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot;. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″&#x27;s Tom Bramwell judged that &quot;&quot;Paper Mario&quot; is a vastly superior game to &quot;SMRPG&quot;&quot;, while &quot;IGN&quot; compared the game&#x27;s simple plot unfavourably with the SNES game, and &quot;RPGFan&quot; claimed that some of &quot;Paper Mario&quot;″s story was copied from it. &quot;RPGFan&quot; also questioned the name of &quot;Paper Mario&quot;, as there were, in their opinion, insufficient gameplay features or aspects which used the paper theme to justify the name.

Critics lauded the game&#x27;s blend of RPG and platforming aspects. &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted the &quot;exciting and somewhat strategic&quot; battle system, which requires the player exploit the enemies&#x27; weak points. The &quot;refreshing&quot; action command features was praised in particular for adding originality to a battle formula that was present in many games of the same genre. &quot;IGN&quot; claimed the game was &quot;the best RPG for Nintendo 64&quot;, calling it &quot;fantastically deep, intuitively designed, and wonderfully rewarding&quot;. Despite this, enemy design itself was bemoaned for being &quot;corny and generic&quot;, with notable exceptions to some of the &quot;Paper Mario&quot;″s original boss characters. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; noted how &quot;Of the various characters you meet, none is of less importance than any other&quot;, welcoming the partner characters and their relating puzzles. &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the game&#x27;s use of humour and side quests, with references to the control of Peach in particular.

The reaction to the game&#x27;s visuals was generally positive. &quot;IGN&quot; noted some paper-based visual effects such as when Mario folds in a bed to sleep, but complained about character zoom-ins, which revealed &quot;a pixelated mass of colors&quot;. Although reviewers claimed that the novel graphical style was initially confusing, most welcomed the style eventually, with &quot;GameSpot&quot; claiming that it was &quot;extremely well done&quot;. The audio was also mainly praised, although reviewers criticised the lack of voice acting and character-specific sound effects. &quot;RPGFan&quot; was particularly critical of the game&#x27;s &quot;generic filler music&quot;, despite enjoying use of multiple songs simultaneously.

Chester Barber reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that &quot;One of the best RPGs ever, and definitely the best RPG available for Nintendo 64. Even if you&#x27;ve only been buying games for newer systems, this is a must-buy.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; named &quot;Paper Mario&quot; the best Nintendo 64 game of 2001. It was a runner-up for the publication&#x27;s annual &quot;Best Role-Playing Game&quot; prize among console games, which went to &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. During the 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Paper Mario&quot; was nominated for the &quot;Console Role-Playing&quot; award by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences. 

The game was also well received upon release for the Virtual Console, with &quot;IGN&quot;″s Lucas M. Thomas stating &quot;it&#x27;s held up very well even placed into context against its GameCube and Wii era sequels, and it&#x27;s an RPG for goodness sakes&quot;. &quot;Paper Mario&quot; also proved popular on the Virtual Console, reaching a high of &quot;second most downloaded game&quot; in the US in August 2007.

In 2023, enthusiasts fully decompiled the game&#x27;s ROM into human-readable C code.

<doc id="88529" wikidata="Q1131204" url="?curid=88529" title="Bush Doctrine">
<text>The Bush Doctrine refers to multiple interrelated foreign policy principles of the 43rd President of the United States, George W. Bush. These principles include unilateralism, preemptive war, and regime change.

Charles Krauthammer first used the phrase in June 2001, to describe the Bush administration&#x27;s &quot;unilaterally withdrawing from the ABM treaty and rejecting the Kyoto protocol.&quot; After the September 11 attacks, the phrase described the policy that the U.S. had the right to secure itself against countries that harbor or give aid to terrorist groups, which was used to justify the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. The Bush Doctrine became strongly associated with the Bush administration&#x27;s decision to invade Iraq in 2003.

Different pundits have attributed different meanings to the Bush Doctrine. It was used to describe specific policy elements, including a strategy of &quot;preemptive strikes&quot; as a defense against an immediate or perceived future threat to the security of the United States. This policy principle was applied particularly in the Middle East to counter international terrorist organizations and to justify the invasion of Iraq.

Generally, the Bush Doctrine was used to indicate a willingness to unilaterally pursue U.S. economic interests. Some of these policies were codified in a National Security Council text entitled the &quot;National Security Strategy of the United States&quot; published on September 20, 2002.

The phrase &quot;Bush Doctrine&quot; was rarely used by members of the Bush administration. The expression was used at least once, though, by Vice President Dick Cheney, in a June 2003 speech in which he said, &quot;If there is anyone in the world today who doubts the seriousness of the Bush Doctrine, I would urge that person to consider the fate of the Taliban in Afghanistan, and of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime in Iraq.&quot;

==&quot;National Security Strategy of the United States&quot;==
The main elements of the Bush Doctrine were delineated in a document, the &quot;National Security Strategy of the United States&quot;, published on September 17, 2002. This document is often cited as the definitive statement of the doctrine. As updated in 2006, it states:

==Components==
The Bush Doctrine is defined as &quot;a collection of strategy principles, practical policy decisions, and a set of rationales and ideas for guiding United States foreign policy.&quot; Some of these had reemerged from the 1992 draft Wolfowitz Doctrine, which had been leaked and disavowed by the first Bush administration; Paul Wolfowitz, as deputy secretary of defense, was at the center of the new Bush administration&#x27;s strategic planning. Two main pillars are identified for the doctrine: 1.) preemptive strikes against potential enemies and 2.) promoting democratic regime change.

The Bush administration claimed that the U.S. was locked in a global war; a war of ideology, in which its enemies are bound together by a common ideology and a common hatred of democracy.

Out of the &quot;National Security Strategy&quot;, four main points are highlighted as the core to the Bush Doctrine: 1.) Preemption, 2.) Military Primacy, 3.) New Multilateralism, and 4.) the Spread of Democracy. The document emphasized preemption, stating, &quot;America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few&quot;, and required &quot;defending the United States, the American people, and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders.&quot;

Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld remarked thus in 2006, in a statement taken to reflect his view of the doctrine&#x27;s efficacy: &quot;If I were rating, I would say we probably deserve a D or D+ as a country as how well we&#x27;re doing in the battle of ideas that&#x27;s taking place. I&#x27;m not going to suggest that it&#x27;s easy, but we have not found the formula as a country.&quot;

In his 2010 memoir &quot;Decision Points&quot;, Bush articulates his discrete concept of the Bush Doctrine. He stated that his doctrine consisted of four &quot;prongs&quot;, three of them practical, and one idealistic. They are the following: (in his words)
# &quot;Make no distinction between terrorists and the nations that harbor them — and hold both to account.&quot;
# &quot;Take the fight to the enemy overseas before they can attack us again here at home.&quot;
# &quot;Confront threats before they fully materialize.&quot;
# &quot;Advance liberty and hope as an alternative to the enemy&#x27;s ideology of repression and fear.&quot;

===Unilateralism===
Unilateral elements were evident early in Bush&#x27;s presidency. Krauthammer, who coined the term &quot;Bush Doctrine&quot;, deployed &quot;unilateralism&quot;, in February 2001 to refer to Bush&#x27;s increased unilateralism in foreign policy, specifically regarding his decision to withdraw from the ABM treaty.

There is some evidence that Bush&#x27;s willingness for the U.S. to act unilaterally came even earlier. The &quot;International Journal of Peace Studies&quot; 2003 article &quot;The Bush administration&#x27;s image of Europe: From ambivalence to rigidity&quot; states:

===Attacking countries that harbor terrorists===

The doctrine was developed more fully as an executive branch response following the September 11 attacks. The attacks presented a foreign policy challenge, since it was not Afghanistan that had initiated the attacks, and there was no evidence that they had any foreknowledge of them. In an address to the nation on the evening of September 11, Bush stated his resolution of the issue by declaring that, &quot;We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.&quot; The president made an even more aggressive restatement of this principle in his September 20, 2001 address to a joint session of Congress:

White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer later wrote in an autobiographical account of that address, &quot;In a speech hailed by the press and by Democrats, [the President] announced what became known as the &#x27;Bush Doctrine&#x27;&quot;. The first published reference after the 9/11 attacks to the terror-fighting doctrine appeared September 30 in an op-ed by political scientist Neal Coates.

This policy was used to justify the invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, and has since been applied to U.S. military action against al-Qaeda camps in North-West Pakistan.

===Pre-emptive strikes===
Bush addressed cadets at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York on June 1, 2002, and made clear the role preemptive war would play in the future of American foreign policy and national defense:

The stance of the Bush administration was that the harsh measures to spread the democracy worldwide are inevitable and efficacious, in which for instance, liberating Iraq would plant democracy in the area and enable it to flourish in the rest of the Middle East.

Two distinct schools of thought arose in the Bush administration regarding how to handle countries such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea (the so-called &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; states). Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, as well as U.S. Department of State specialists, argued for what was essentially the continuation of existing U.S. foreign policy. These policies, developed after the Cold War, sought to establish a multilateral consensus for action (which would likely take the form of increasingly harsh sanctions against the problem states, summarized as the policy of containment). The opposing view, argued by Cheney, Rumsfeld, and a number of influential Department of Defense policy makers like Wolfowitz and Richard Perle, held that direct and unilateral action was both possible and justified and that the U.S. should embrace the opportunities for democracy and security offered by its position as sole remaining superpower.

===Democratic regime change===
In several speeches between late 2001 and 2002, Bush expanded on his view of the U.S. foreign policy and global intervention, declaring that the United States should actively support democratic governments around the world, especially in the Middle East, as a strategy for combating the threat of terrorism, and that the nation had to act unilaterally in its own security interests, without approval of international bodies like the United Nations. This represented a departure from the Cold War policies of deterrence and containment under the Truman Doctrine and post–Cold War philosophies such as the Powell Doctrine and the Clinton Doctrine.

In his 2003 State of the Union Address, Bush declared:

After his second inauguration, in a January 2006 speech at the National Defense University, Bush said: &quot;The defense of freedom requires the advance of freedom.&quot;

Neoconservatives and the Bush Doctrine held that the hatred for the West and the United States particularly exists not because of actions perpetrated by the U.S., but rather because the countries from which terrorists emerge are in social disarray and do not experience the freedom that is an intrinsic part of democracy. The Bush Doctrine holds that enemies of the U.S. use terrorism as a war of ideology against the nation. The responsibility of the United States is to protect itself by promoting democracy where the terrorists are located so as to undermine the basis for terrorist activities. Elections in Egypt, Lebanon, and Palestine happened as a result of this initiative in the sense that the Muslim Brotherhood, Hezbollah, and Hamas were allowed to participate in it.

==Influences on the Bush Doctrine==
===Neoconservatives===
The development of the doctrine was influenced by neoconservative ideology, and it was considered to be a step from the political realism of the Reagan Doctrine. The Reagan Doctrine was considered key to American foreign policy until the end of the Cold War, just before Bill Clinton became president. The Reagan Doctrine was considered anti-communist and in opposition to Soviet global influence, but later spoke of a peace dividend towards the end of the Cold War with economic benefits of a decrease in defense spending. The Reagan Doctrine was strongly criticized by neoconservatives, who also became disgruntled with the outcome of the Gulf War and U.S. foreign policy under Clinton, sparking them to call for change towards global stability through their support for active intervention and the democratic peace theory. Several central persons in the counsel to the Bush administration considered themselves to be neoconservatives or strongly support their foreign policy ideas.

Neoconservatives are widely known to long have supported the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and on January 26, 1998, the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) sent a public letter to then-President Clinton stating:

Among the signatories to PNAC&#x27;s original statement of Principals is George H. W. Bush&#x27;s Vice President Dan Quayle, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Cheney, and George W. Bush&#x27;s brother Jeb Bush.

PNAC member and the chairman of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee (DPBAC), neoconservative Richard Perle, later expressed regret over the invasion of Iraq and ultimately put the blame for the invasion on Bush.

Other Bush cabinet members who are thought to have adopted neoconservative foreign policy thinking include Cheney and Rice.

The Bush Doctrine, in line with long-standing neoconservative ideas, held that the United States is entangled in a global war of ideas between the western values of freedom on the one hand, and extremism seeking to destroy them on the other; a war of ideology where the U.S. must take responsibility for security and show leadership in the world by actively seeking out the enemies and also change those countries who are supporting enemies.

The Bush Doctrine, and neoconservative reasoning, held that containment of the enemy as under the &quot;realpolitik&quot; of President Ronald Reagan did not work, and that the enemy of the U.S. must be destroyed preemptively before they attack—using all the United States&#x27; available means, resources and influences to do so.

On the book &quot;Winning the War on Terror&quot; Dr. James Forest of the U.S. Military Academy Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, comments: &quot;While the West faces uncertainties in the struggle against militant Islam&#x27;s armies of darkness, and while it is true that we do not yet know precisely how it will end, what has become abundantly clear is that the world will succeed in defeating militant Islam because of the West&#x27;s flexible, democratic institutions and its all-encompassing ideology of freedom.&quot;

===Natan Sharansky===

Another part of the intellectual underpinning of the Bush Doctrine was the 2004 book &quot;The Case for Democracy&quot;, written by Israeli politician and author Natan Sharansky and Israeli Minister of Economic Affairs in the United States Ron Dermer, which Bush has cited as influential in his thinking. The book argues that replacing dictatorships with democratic governments is both morally justified since it leads to greater freedom for the citizens of such countries, and strategically wise, since democratic countries are more peaceful, and breed less terrorism than dictatorial ones.

===Expanding United States influence===
Princeton University research fellow Dr. Jonathan Monten, in his 2005 &quot;International Security&quot; journal article &quot;The Roots of the Bush Doctrine: Power, Nationalism, and Democracy Promotion in U.S. Strategy&quot;, attributed the Bush administration&#x27;s activist democracy promotion to two main factors: the expansion of material capabilities, and the presence of a nationalist domestic ideology. He claims that the Bush Doctrine&#x27;s promotion of democracy abroad was held as vital by the Bush administration to the success of the United States in the &quot;war on terror&quot;. It was also a key objective of the administration&#x27;s grand strategy of expanding the political and economic influence of the U.S. internationally. He examines two contending approaches to the long-term promotion of democracy: &quot;&quot;exemplarism&quot;, or leadership by example, and &quot;vindicationism&quot;&quot;, or the direct application of American power, including the use of coercive force. Whereas exemplarism largely prevailed in the 20th century, vindicationism has been the preferred approach of the Bush administration.

==Criticism and analysis==
The Bush Doctrine resulted in criticism and controversy. Peter D. Feaver, who worked on the Bush national security strategy as a staff member on the National Security Council, said he has counted as many as seven distinct Bush doctrines. One of the drafters of the National Security Strategy of the U.S., which is commonly mistakenly referred to as the &quot;Bush Doctrine&quot;, demurred at investing the statement with too much weight. &quot;I actually never thought there was a Bush doctrine&quot;, said Philip Zelikow, who later served as State Department counselor under Secretary of State Rice. &quot;Indeed, I believe the assertion that there is such a doctrine lends greater coherence to the administration&#x27;s policies than they deserve.&quot; Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s National Security Advisor, said he thought there was no &quot;single piece of paper&quot; that represents the Bush Doctrine.

Experts on geopolitical strategy note that Halford Mackinder&#x27;s theories in &quot;The Geographical Pivot of History&quot; about the &quot;Heartland&quot; and world resource control are still as valid today as when they were formulated.

In his 2007 book &quot;In the Defense of the Bush Doctrine&quot;, Robert G. Kaufman wrote: &quot;No one grasped the logics or implications of this transformation better than Halford Mackinder. His prescient theories, first set forth in &quot;Geographical Pivot of History&quot;, published in 1904, have rightly shaped American grand strategy since World War II. Mackinder warned that any single power dominating Eurasia, &quot;the World Island&quot;, as he called it, would have the potential to dominate the world, including the United States.&quot; Kaufman is a political scientist, public policy professor and member of The Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee. He said in an interview about the book: &quot;I wrote this book because of my conviction that the Bush Doctrine has a more compelling logic and historical pedigree than people realize.&quot;

The Bush Doctrine was polarizing both domestically and internationally. In 2008, polls showed there was more anti-Americanism than before the Bush administration formed the Bush Doctrine; this increase was probably, at least partially, a result of implementing the Bush Doctrine and conservative foreign policy.

===Foreign interventionism===

The foreign policy of the Bush Doctrine was subject to controversy both in the United States and internationally.

John Mearsheimer argues in his book &quot;The Great Delusion: Liberal Dreams and International Realities&quot; that a liberal hegemonic policy like the Bush Doctrine is ineffective at achieving its stated end goals and is doomed to lead to more war, anti-Americanism, and a global retreat in democracy.

Some critics of the policies were suspicious of the increasing willingness of the U.S. to use military force unilaterally.

Robert W. Tucker and David C. Hendrickson argued that it reflects a turn away from international law, and marks the end of American legitimacy in foreign affairs.

Others have stated that it could lead to other states resorting to the production of WMDs or terrorist activities. This doctrine is argued to be contrary to the just war theory and would constitute a war of aggression. Pat Buchanan writes that the invasion of Iraq had significant similarities to the 1996 neoconservative policy paper &quot;A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm&quot;.

Political scientist Karen Kwiatkowski in 2007 wrote in her article &quot;Making Sense of the Bush Doctrine&quot;:

We are killing terrorists in self-defense and for the good of the world, you see. We are taking over foreign countries, setting them up with our favorite puppets &quot;in charge,&quot; controlling their economy, their movements, their dress codes, their defensive projects, and their dreams, solely because we love them, and apparently can&#x27;t live without them.

===Radical departure===
According to Buchanan and others, the Bush Doctrine was a radical departure from former United States foreign policies, and a continuation of the ideological roots of neoconservatism.

Initially, support for the U.S. was high, but by the end of the Bush administration, after seven years of war, anti-Americanism was high and criticism of the Bush Doctrine was widespread; nonetheless the doctrine still had support among some American political leaders.

The representation of prominent neoconservatives and their influences on the Bush Doctrine had been highly controversial among the American public.

Critics, like John Micklethwait in the book &quot;The Right Nation&quot;, claim that Bush was deceived by neoconservatives into adopting their policies.

===Polarization===
Anti-war critics have claimed that the Bush Doctrine was strongly polarizing domestically, had estranged U.S. allies, and belied Bush&#x27;s stated desire to be a &quot;uniter, not a divider&quot;.

===Compassionate belief and religious influence===
Bush often talked about his belief in compassionate conservatism and liberty as &quot;God&#x27;s gift&quot;. In his Claremont Institute article &quot;Democracy and the Bush Doctrine&quot;, Charles R. Kesler writes, &quot;As he begins his second term, the president and his advisors must take a hard, second look at the Bush Doctrine. In many respects, it is the export version of compassionate conservatism.&quot;

===Sociopsychological strategy and effects===
There is also criticism on Bush Doctrine practices related to their sociopsychological effects saying they create a culture of fear.

Naomi Klein writes in her book &quot;The Shock Doctrine&quot; about a recurrent metaphor of shock, and she claimed in an interview that the Bush administration continued to exploit a &quot;window of opportunity that opens up in a state of shock&quot;, followed by a comforting rationale for the public, as a form of social control.

===Democratization===
Some commentators argue that the Bush Doctrine has not aimed to support genuine democratic regimes driven by local peoples, but rather U.S.-friendly regimes installed by diplomats acting on behalf of the United States and intended only to seem democratic to American voters. For example, in the case of Afghanistan, it is argued that parliamentary democracy was downplayed by the U.S. and power concentrated in the hands of Afghan president Hamid Karzai, a U.S. ally. The election of Karzai has been described as the result of manipulation on the parts of the U.S. government and American policy maker Zalmay Khalilzad. At the same time, these commentators draw attention to the number of unpopular (but U.S.-friendly) warlords achieving &quot;legitimating&quot; positions under United States supervision of the elections. Some commentators interpreted voter turnout figures as evidence of &quot;large-scale fraud&quot;. Sonali Kolhatkar and James Ingalls have written, &quot;It remains to be seen if U.S. policymakers will ever allow anything approaching democracy to break out in Afghanistan and interfere with their plans.&quot;

Of the elections in Afghanistan, Sima Samar, former Afghan minister of Women&#x27;s Affairs, stated, &quot;This is not a democracy, it is a rubber stamp. Everything has already been decided by the powerful ones.&quot;

Most studies of American intervention have been pessimistic about the history of the United States exporting democracy. John A. Tures examined 228 cases of U.S. intervention from 1973 to 2005, using data from Freedom House. While in 63 cases a country did become more democratic, in 69 instances the country became less democratic - and the plurality of interventions, 96, caused no change in the country&#x27;s democracy.

<text>A foreign policy doctrine is a general statement of a country&#x27;s foreign policy and the belief system that inform it and guide its strategy. It may be presented in the form of a political speech, doctrine or other official document. 

The purpose of a foreign policy doctrine is to provide general rules for the conduct of foreign policy through decisions on international relations. These rules allow the political leadership of a nation to deal with a situation and to explain the actions of a nation to other nations. “Doctrine” is usually not meant to have any negative connotations; it is especially not to be confused with “dogma.”

In some cases, the statement is made by a political leader, typically a nation’s chief executive or chief diplomat, and comes to be named after that leader. Richard Nixon’s justification for the phased withdrawal of the United States from the Vietnam War, for example, came to be called the Nixon Doctrine. This pattern of naming is not universal, however; Chinese doctrines, for example, are often referred to by number.

<text>Mario Morales Micheo (born November 13, 1957) is a former Puerto Rican basketball player. Nicknamed &quot;Quijote&quot;, he was known for his ability to conquer both scoring and team championships in Puerto Rico&#x27;s BSN league. He is the father of Evansville Purple Aces women&#x27;s volleyball coach Fernando Morales Lopez. And he also played for the Villanova Wildcats Men&#x27;s Basketball team in 1975–76 season where he averaged 4.7 points and 1.5 rebounds and Villanova went 16–11.

==Biography==

===Professional career===
Morales became a member of the BSN&#x27;s &quot;Cangrejeros De Santurce&quot; in 1974, when he was only 17 while still playing high school basketball at the Colegio De La Salle in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. Four years later he became a member of Puerto Rico&#x27;s national basketball team. Morales didn&#x27;t go to the Montreal Olympics because, being under 21 years old in 1976, he still couldn&#x27;t join the national team, the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, because Puerto Rico&#x27;s Olympic committee decided to join the United States in the boycott, and the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games because the national team did not qualify for those. However, when he did get to go to the Olympics, for the Seoul games in 1988 and the Barcelona games in 1992, he impressed international audiences with his skills and savvy.

In between Olympics and Olympics, he became an effective shooter from the 3-point area in the BSN. In 1976, the &quot;Cangrejeros&quot; became the &quot;Mets de Guaynabo&quot;, and Morales, aided with the help of his brother in law Federico Fico Lopez, took the Mets to a total of 8 BSN finals, winning 3 championships along the way. The 1989 finals where they won it in 7 games beating the &quot;Leones de Ponce&quot;, featured a classic game 7, where they had to go into overtime before edging out an 92–88 decision.

Morales had his eyes set on the NBA, but after attending college in the United States, the lack of understanding of English became too difficult for him to overcome, and he decided to return to Puerto Rico.

Like other highly educated Puerto Rican athletes, such as the case of internationally renowned Juan &quot;Pachin&quot; Vicens, Mario &quot;Quijote&quot; Morales holds a CPA (Certified Public Accountant) license.

===Retirement===
After he retired, the coliseum where he played for most of his career, Guaynabo&#x27;s Mets Pavilion, was renamed the Mario Quijote Morales Coliseum. There is a large painting of him in a Guaynabo Mets uniform just to the entrance of the coliseum. Pfizer made Morales a spokesperson for Viagra in 2004.

====Legal troubles====
On 4 June 2016, the Puerto Rico Police charged Morales with driving under the influence. An alcohol test showed he had an alcohol level of 0.17 percent, the maximum legal level in Puerto Rico being 0.08 percent.

<text>A hersir was a local Viking military commander of a &quot;hundred&quot; (a county subdivision), of about 100 men, and owed allegiance to a jarl or king. They were also aspiring landowners, and, like the middle class in many feudal societies, supported the kings in their centralization of power. Originally, the term Hersir referred to a wealthy farmer who owned land and had the status of a leader. Throughout the Viking Age, Hersir was eventually redefined as someone who organized and led raids. In the 10th century, the influence of Hersirs began to decrease due to the development of effective national monarchies in Scandinavia. Hersir was again redefined later on to mean a local leader or representative. The independence of the Hersir as a military leader eventually vanished, to be replaced only by the title of a royal representative. The &quot;Hávamál&quot;, which was the mythical advice of the supreme creator Odin to humankind, contains a number of verses emphasizing the virtue of cautious consideration and strategical attack. This theme, in its oral form, was one of the major influences on the mind of the Viking Hersir.

==Equipment==

The main weapon of the Hersirs was the Viking sword. This sword is clearly distinguished by its “Type H” hilt. It was the most prominent type of hilt during the Viking Age. The material of the hilt ranged, depending on the wealth of the owner, from polished steel and with decorative wire inlays of silver, copper, and/or tin. The pommel and upper guard of the sword are formed in two separate parts, then bolted together with a twisted sterling silver wire between the pommel and upper guard. The blade is classified as a Geibig Type 3, which is defined by a moderate taper in width and a fuller taper in width towards the point. The type can be dated to the period between second half of the 8th century to the second half of the 10th century. The sword is designed to symbolize power and authority, as well as cool level-headedness.

For long-distance travel, men would often be on horseback. For overseas journeys, Viking longboats were capable of transporting thirty people to their destination, which would even include the reaches of inner Russia.

Hersirs were always equipped with a shield, which was normally wooden and that accompanied the sword.

==Dress==

Armour was often used as means of displaying wealth as much as functional battle purposes. The hersir was often equipped with a rounded or conical helmet and a short mail coat. The type of helmet, sword, and ringmail corselet worn by the Viking, demonstrated the wealth of the warrior. Armour finds from this period are rare. Perhaps the most famous example is the mail coat and helmet found at Gjermundbu. Hersirs are typically thought to be very well groomed.

Shoes and boots were typically made from cattle, seals, or reindeer. Hersirs usually wore more elegant boots than that of the ordinary military personnel. There are two main types of Viking shoe. The first and most common is by thonging around the top of the shoe. This can be seen in the Jorvik II ankle boot. The Jorvik I type is closed by a flap crossing over and closing with a button. The Hedeby shoe is an early type of turn shoe. This is the least common type found, but could be less costly, but less protective. Any of these types of shoes may have been worn by the Hersir.

Baggy trousers made out of linen or woven wool that were either mid-calf or just below the knee were the typically worn. Tight fitting trousers became the popular style during the late 10th century. Tunics were usually knee length and gathered at the waist with a belt. The sleeves of the tunic were to the wrist or longer. From the elbow to the shoulder, the sleeve was tight fitting. The overtunic would be constructed along the same pattern as the undertunic and made of wool. A richer Hersir would have had a tunic dyed in a bright color with tablet woven strips around the neck and cuffs. There is some evidence the undertunic would be longer than the overtunic, showing a contrasting color at the sleeves and hem.

==Military tactics==
Vikings were very skilled sailors. Sailing instructions passed down from generation to generation paired with the advancements in technology allowed for the Vikings to dominate the waters. A common military tactic first used in 866, was the transfer from boat to land by the use of captured horses. Despite the fact that Vikings often used horses, they were not cavalry men primarily due to the low number of horses in Scandinavia. Horses were often used for overland routes but the Vikings always fought on foot. Ordinarily, they would align themselves in a shield wall formation with the Hersir at the front and archers and slingers in the back. In the shield wall, the Vikings would stand close together in order to overlap their shields, thus creating a wall out of shields. Another formation that was also used, called the &quot;Svinfylking&quot;, was a variation to the shield wall but with several wedge-like formations pointing towards the enemy, creating a zig-zag pattern.

==Religious views==
Hersirs&#x27; religious beliefs are somewhat unclear although they seemed to lie somewhere between Christianity and Paganism. Sometimes, Hersirs would be baptised, although it was most often not done for religious purposes. In many cases, Hersirs would be baptised in order to improve trade with the Christians or in obedience to a new king.

==Hersirs in history==
Hersir was the name of a man in &quot;Rígsþula&quot; whose daughter Erna married Jarl, the first earl.

A Swedish hersir, Jarlabanke Ingefastsson, has become notable for the about 20 Jarlabanke Runestones that he raised together with his relatives.

Ketill Flatnose was a Norwegian hersir of the 9th century.

Aud the Deep-Minded (Ketilsd%C3%B3ttir) (Auður Djúpaúðga Ketilsdóttir) was the daughter of Ketill &quot;Flatnose&quot; Bjornsson.

In the Sagas of Icelanders there is mention of several hersirs, such as a powerful hersir in Sognefjord called Bjorn &quot;Buna&quot; Grimsson, who lived at Aurland and was the father of Ketill &quot;Flatnose&quot; Bjornsson. As related in Egil&#x27;s Saga, he was a traveler, adventurer, and Viking raider.

Thorgerdur Eylaugsdottir (Þorgerður Eylaugsdóttir) was a female Hersir of Sogn. In Landnáma Björns lineage is traced to his foremothers rather than his forefathers. Only his father Grímur is mentioned in Bjorns lineage that continues to grandmother Hervör and great-grandmother Thorgerdur Eylaugsdóttir hersir. This is rare in the stories of the Icelanders indicating the importance if Thorgerdur.

<text>The Truman Doctrine is a U.S. foreign policy that pledges American support for democratic nations against authoritarian threats. The doctrine originated with the primary goal of countering the growth of the Soviet bloc during the Cold War. It was announced to Congress by President Harry S. Truman on March 12, 1947, and further developed on July 4, 1948, when he pledged to oppose the communist rebellions in Greece and Soviet demands from Turkey. More generally, the Truman Doctrine implied U.S. support for other nations threatened by Moscow. It led to the formation of NATO in 1949. Historians often use Truman&#x27;s speech to Congress on March 12, 1947, to date the start of the Cold War.

Truman told Congress that &quot;it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.&quot; Truman contended that because totalitarian regimes coerced free peoples, they automatically represented a threat to international peace and the national security of the United States. Truman argued that if Greece and Turkey did not receive the aid, they would inevitably fall out of the United States&#x27; sphere of influence and into the communist bloc, with grave consequences throughout the region.

The Truman Doctrine was informally extended to become the basis of American Cold War policy throughout Europe and around the world. It shifted U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union from a wartime alliance to containment of Soviet expansion, as advocated by diplomat George F. Kennan.

==Turkish Straits crisis==
At the conclusion of World War II, Turkey was pressured by the Soviet government to allow Soviet shipping to flow freely through the Turkish straits, which connected the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. As the Turkish government would not submit to the Soviet Union&#x27;s requests, tensions arose in the region, leading to a show of naval force on the site of the Straits. Since British assistance to Turkey had ended in 1947, the U.S. dispatched military aid to ensure that Turkey would retain chief control of the passage. Turkey received $100 million in economic and military aid and the U.S. Navy sent the &quot;Midway&quot;-class aircraft carrier .

==Greek crisis==
In October 1944, British and Greek forces landed in Greece following the gradual withdrawal of Axis occupational forces from the country. Despite the Caserta Agreement stipulating that all Greek resistance factions would join a new Greek Army under British command, General Ronald Scobie ordered the EAM&#x27;s armed wing, ELAS, to unilaterally disarm on December, 1 1944. EAM responded to the &quot;Scobie Order&quot; by organizing a rally in Athens on December 3 in protest, which was fired upon by Greek security forces, killing 28 protestors. This sparked the &quot;Dekemvriana&quot;, a series of clashes between EAM and Greek government forces along with their British allies. It ended in EAM&#x27;s defeat and disarmament under the terms of the Treaty of Varkiza, which marked the end of ELAS and broke EAM&#x27;s power. This was followed by the White Terror, a period of persecution against Greek leftists, which contributed to the outbreak of the Greek Civil War in 1946. 

After the civil war broke out, Communist Party of Greece (KKE) guerrillas revolted against the internationally recognized Greek government which was formed after elections in 1946 which were boycotted by the KKE. The British realized that the KKE were being directly funded by Josip Broz Tito in neighboring Yugoslavia. In line with the Anglo-Soviet percentages agreement, the KKE received no help from the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia provided them support and sanctuary against Joseph Stalin&#x27;s wishes. By late 1946, Britain informed the U.S. that due to its own declining economy, it could no longer continue to provide military and economic support to the Greek government.

In 1946–47, the United States and the Soviet Union moved from being wartime allies to Cold War adversaries. The breakdown of Allied cooperation in Germany provided a backdrop of escalating tensions for the Truman Doctrine. To Truman, the growing unrest in Greece began to look like a pincer movement against the oil-rich areas of the Middle East and the warm-water ports of the Mediterranean. In February 1946, George F. Kennan, an American diplomat in Moscow, sent his famed &quot;Long Telegram&quot;, which predicted the Soviets would only respond to force and that the best way to handle them would be through a long-term strategy of containment; that is, stopping their geographical expansion. After the British warned that they could no longer help Greece, and following Prime Minister Konstantinos Tsaldaris&#x27;s visit to Washington, D.C. in December 1946 to ask for assistance, the U.S. State Department formulated a plan. Aid would be given to both Greece and Turkey, to help cool the long-standing rivalry between them.

American policy makers recognized the instability of the region, fearing that if Greece was lost to communism, Turkey would not last long. Similarly, if Turkey yielded to Soviet demands, the position of Greece would be endangered. A regional domino effect threat therefore guided the American decision. Greece and Turkey were strategic allies important for geographical reasons as well, for the fall of Greece would put the Soviets on a particularly dangerous flank for the Turks, and strengthen the Soviet Union&#x27;s ability to cut off allied supply lines in the event of war.

==Truman&#x27;s address==

To pass any legislation, Truman needed the support of the Republicans, who controlled both houses of Congress. The chief Republican spokesman Senator Arthur Vandenberg strongly supported Truman and overcame the doubts of isolationists such as Senator Robert A. Taft. Truman laid the groundwork for his request by having key congressional leaders meet with himself, Secretary of State George C. Marshall, and Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson. Acheson laid out the &quot;domino theory&quot; in the starkest terms, comparing a communist state to a rotten apple that could spread its infection to an entire barrel. Vandenberg was impressed, and advised Truman to appear before Congress and &quot;scare the hell out of the American people.&quot; On March 7, Acheson warned Truman that the communists in Greece could win within weeks without outside aid.

When a draft for Truman&#x27;s address was circulated to policymakers, Marshall, Kennan, and others criticized it for containing excess &quot;rhetoric.&quot; Truman responded that, as Vandenberg had suggested, his request would only be approved if he played up the threat.

On March 12, 1947, Truman appeared before a joint session of Congress. In his eighteen-minute speech, he stated:

The domestic reaction to Truman&#x27;s speech was broadly positive, though there were dissenters. Anti-communists in both parties supported both Truman&#x27;s proposed aid package and the doctrine behind it, and &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; described it as a &quot;popularity jackpot&quot; for the President. Influential columnist Walter Lippmann was more skeptical, noting the open-ended nature of Truman&#x27;s pledge; he felt so strongly that he almost came to blows while arguing with Acheson over the doctrine. Others argued that the Greek monarchy Truman proposed to defend was itself a repressive government, rather than a democracy.

Despite these objections, the fear that there was a growing communist threat almost guaranteed the bill&#x27;s passage. In May 1947, two months after Truman&#x27;s request, a large majority of Congress approved $400 million in military and economic aid to Greece and Turkey. Increased American aid assisted the Greek government&#x27;s defeat of the KKE, after interim defeats for government forces from 1946 to 1948. The Truman Doctrine was the first in a series of containment moves by the United States, followed by economic restoration of Western Europe through the Marshall Plan and military containment by the creation of NATO in 1949.

==Long-term policy and metaphor==

Historian Eric Foner writes that the doctrine &quot;set a precedent for American assistance to anticommunist regimes throughout the world, no matter how undemocratic, and for the creation of a set of global military alliances directed against the Soviet Union.&quot;

The Truman Doctrine underpinned American Cold War policy in Europe and around the world. In the words of historian James T. Patterson:

The Truman Doctrine was a highly publicized commitment of a sort the administration had not previously undertaken. Its sweeping rhetoric, promising that the United States should aid all &#x27;free people&#x27; being subjugated, set the stage for innumerable later ventures that led to globalisation commitments. It was in these ways a major step.

Historian Dennis Merill argues that the doctrine endured because it addressed broader cultural insecurity regarding modern life in a globalized world. It dealt with Washington&#x27;s concern over communism&#x27;s domino effect, it enabled a media-sensitive presentation of the doctrine that won bipartisan support, and it mobilized American economic power to modernize and stabilize unstable regions without direct military intervention. It brought nation-building activities and modernization programs to the forefront of foreign policy.

The Truman Doctrine became a metaphor for aid to keep a nation from communist influence. Truman used disease imagery not only to communicate a sense of impending disaster in the spread of communism but also to create a &quot;rhetorical vision&quot; of containing it by extending a protective shield around non-communist countries throughout the world. It echoed the &quot;quarantine the aggressor&quot; policy Truman&#x27;s predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, had sought to impose to contain German and Japanese expansion in 1937 (&quot;quarantine&quot; suggested the role of public health officials handling an infectious disease). The medical metaphor extended beyond the immediate aims of the Truman Doctrine in that the imagery, combined with fire and flood imagery evocative of disaster, provided the U.S. with an easy transition to direct military confrontation in later years with the Korean War and the Vietnam War. By framing ideological differences in life or death terms, Truman was able to garner support for this communism-containing policy.

<text>The Eisenhower Doctrine was a policy enunciated by U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower on January 5, 1957, within a &quot;Special Message to the Congress on the Situation in the Middle East&quot;. Under the Eisenhower Doctrine, a Middle Eastern country could request American economic assistance or aid from U.S. military forces if it was being threatened by armed aggression. Eisenhower singled out the Soviet threat in his doctrine by authorizing the commitment of U.S. forces &quot;to secure and protect the territorial integrity and political independence of such nations, requesting such aid against overt armed aggression from any nation controlled by international communism.&quot; The phrase &quot;international communism&quot; made the doctrine much broader than simply responding to Soviet military action. A danger that could be linked to communists of any nation could conceivably invoke the doctrine.

Most Arabs regarded the doctrine as a transparent ploy to promote Western influence in the Middle East by restraining Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s brand of Arab nationalism that opposed Western domination, and some like the Syrians publicly denounced the initiative as an insidious example of U.S. imperialism. Following the 1958 crisis in Lebanon and accusations by U.S. senators of exaggerating the threat of communism to the region, Eisenhower privately admitted that the real goal was combating Arab nationalism.

==Background==

In the global political context, the doctrine was made in response to the possibility of a generalized war, threatened due to the Soviet Union&#x27;s latent threat becoming involved in Egypt after the Suez Crisis. Coupled with the power vacuum left by the decline of British and French power in the region after the U.S. protested against the conduct of their allies during the Suez War, Eisenhower thought that the strong position needed to better the situation was further complicated by the positions taken by Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, who was rapidly building a power base and using it to play the Soviets and Americans against each other, taking a position of &quot;positive neutrality&quot; and accepting aid from the Soviets.

On the regional level, the doctrine&#x27;s intent was to provide the independent Arab regimes with an alternative to Nasser&#x27;s political control, strengthening them while isolating communist influence through Nasser&#x27;s isolation. It largely failed on that front, with Nasser&#x27;s power quickly rising by 1959 to when he could shape the leadership outcomes in neighboring Arab countries such as Iraq and Saudi Arabia; in the meantime, his relationship with the Soviets deteriorated, allowing the U.S. to switch to a policy of accommodation.

The administration also saw the Middle East as being critical for future foreign policy regarding the U.S. and its allies. The region contains a large percentage of the world&#x27;s oil reserves needed by the allies. Eisenhower&#x27;s protests against longtime allies—Britain and France—during the Suez Crisis lead to the collapse of British and French influence in the Middle East, spawning fears of Soviet domination made more credible by Nasser&#x27;s increasingly pro-Soviet disposition. The Eisenhower Doctrine was a backflip against the previous policy; the U.S. now had the burden of military action in the Middle East to itself.

The doctrine was not successfully applied in that year&#x27;s crisis in Syria but was instead invoked in the Lebanon crisis the following year, when the U.S. intervened in response to a request by that country&#x27;s then President Camille Chamoun.

<text>Mario Tennis is a 2000 sports video game developed by Camelot Software Planning and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 (N64). Following &quot;Mario&#x27;s Tennis&quot;, it is the second game in the &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; series. The game is known for being the introduction of Luigi&#x27;s arch-rival, Waluigi, and the re-introduction of Princess Daisy and Birdo.

Camelot also developed a Game Boy Color (GBC) version, which was published under the same title in Western regions and as Mario Tennis GB in Japan.

The N64 version was re-released on the Wii and Wii U Virtual Console, and on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, in 2010, 2015, and 2021 respectively; the GBC version was re-released on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in 2014, and on the Nintendo Switch Online service in 2024.

== Gameplay ==
The game uses a control system that differs from most other video tennis games. Shots are performed by pressing one, or both, of the two main buttons (A or B), which make the ball spin in different ways. Pressing a button twice strikes the tennis shot with more power and spin. Additionally, pressing the two buttons in a different order can result in a different type of shot altogether, such as a lob or drop shot. Both buttons can be pressed at the same time to hit a very powerful smash shot. The longer a button is pressed before contact is made with the ball, the stronger the shot will be. The control system allows players of all levels to become familiar with the mechanics of the game within a very short time, whilst also encouraging advanced players to take advantage of the variety of shots offered to come up with different strategies for winning points. A total of seven types of shot are possible using only the two main buttons of the controller. These gameplay mechanics were later brought to the newer games of the &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; series. Matches support singles or doubles play.

The Nintendo 64 version includes several gameplay modes. Exhibition allows players to compete in a single basic tennis match. In Tournament mode, players compete in singles or doubles elimination tournaments against computer-controlled opponents, with higher difficulties being unlocked each time a tournament is completed; players can unlock new characters and tennis courts by completing certain tournaments with specific characters. Ring Shot features several game types based around hitting the ball through rings scattered around the court. Piranha Challenge is a single-player challenge mode in which three Piranha Plants randomly spit out balls that the player must return. Bowser Stage is a bonus mode in which the court tilts based on the players&#x27; positions, affecting movement, and the ball can be hit through &quot;Mario Kart&quot; item boxes that release items to disrupt opponents. Most modes support multiplayer for up to two players in singles and up to four players in doubles.

In addition to Exhibition mode, the Game Boy Color version features an exclusive story mode with role-playing game mechanics called Mario Tour. In this mode, players begin as a rookie tennis player at the Royal Tennis Academy, who must build up their skill by leveling up through training and practice matches before entering various tournaments. The aim of this mode is to be crowned champion at the academy, although the second part of the game involves the player competing in a tournament to ultimately face Mario, the best tennis player. The role-playing is playable in singles and doubles (separately), effectively doubling the game&#x27;s longevity. There are training facilities that can help the player progress. The GBC version also features multiple mini-games, such as controlling Donkey Kong to hit banana targets on a wall within a time limit. Multiplayer for two players is supported via use of the Game Link Cable.

The N64 version of &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; features 16 playable characters, 10 of which did not appear in the previous &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; game. Notably, the character Waluigi makes his first appearance in this game, having been created to give Wario a doubles partner. In addition to the player&#x27;s created character, the GBC version features 25 playable characters, consisting of nine &quot;Mario&quot; series characters and 16 human characters from the game&#x27;s story mode.

Through the use of a Nintendo 64 Transfer Pak, players are able to import their characters from the GBC version to the N64 game, retaining the characters&#x27; stats. Using these characters, experience points may be earned to transfer back to the GBC version. As the characters go up in levels, the player may send their improved characters to the N64 version to level up again. Linking the two games also unlocks Yoshi, Wario, Waluigi, Bowser, and their respective mini-games in the GBC version; completing these mini-games and connecting the two games again will in turn unlock up to six new tennis courts in the N64 version. All Transfer Pak functionality was removed from subsequent digital re-releases of both games, though the additional characters and minigames are unlocked by default in the Nintendo Switch Online release of the GBC version. Other features, such as the Ring Tournament mode in the N64 version and multiplayer functionality in the GBC version, are also omitted from the Virtual Console releases.

== Development ==
At Nintendo&#x27;s suggestion, Princess Daisy was brought back from obscurity after having only ever appeared in &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; and &quot;NES Open Tournament Golf&quot; in order to give Luigi a doubles partner like Mario had Peach. Camelot asked Nintendo if the game could also feature girlfriends for Wario and Waluigi, but Miyamoto said that he &quot;didn&#x27;t even want to see their girlfriends.&quot;

The Game Boy Color version had a marketing budget of $4 million.

== Reception ==
&quot;Mario Tennis&quot; received critical acclaim, with critics citing the accessibility and depth of the controls as being very impressive. The game physics and amount of content have also been praised. The Nintendo 64 version received &quot;universal acclaim&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The game was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Nintendo 64 Game&quot; award, losing to &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;. Its Game Boy Color version was nominated for the publication&#x27;s 2001 &quot;Best Game Boy Color Game&quot; award, which went to &quot;Oracle of Seasons&quot; and &quot;Oracle of Ages&quot;.

Dutch magazine &quot;Power Unlimited&quot; gave the N64 version a score of 9.1 out of 10, calling it very addictive, especially with four players.

&quot;Mario Tennis&quot; sold over 200,000 copies within two weeks of its release. It became the eighth best selling Game Boy Color game in Japan, with 357,987 copies sold.

During the 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences honored &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; with the &quot;Console Family&quot; award.
