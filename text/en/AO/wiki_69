<text>Adair County is a county located in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. As of the 2020 census, the population was 19,495. Its county seat is Stilwell. Adair County was named after the Adair family of the Cherokee tribe. One source says that the county was specifically named for Watt Adair, one of the first Cherokees to settle in the area. Adair County is part of the Cherokee Nation reservation.

==History==
The county was created in 1906 from the Goingsnake and Flint districts of the Cherokee Nation. There was a decade-long struggle over what town would become the county seat between Stilwell and Westville. When the county was formed, Westville was identified as the county seat, due partly to its location at the intersection of two major railroads: the Kansas City Southern Railway and the St. Louis – San Francisco Railway. The county seat was moved to Stilwell in 1910.

During the Great Depression and World War II, strawberries became a major crop in Adair County. In 1948, the first Stilwell Strawberry Festival was organized. The 2002 festival saw some 40,000 people in attendance.

The 1910 census counted 10,535 residents. By 1990, it was up to 18,421.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.6%) is water.

The county is part of the Ozark plateau uplift, the tree-covered foothills of the Boston Mountains. North and central Adair County are drained by the Illinois River and three creeks. Two more creeks lie near Stilwell.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2010, Adair County had a small population relative to its surrounding counties, with only 21,038 people, a large percentage of them, 43.3 percent, Native American. The remainder of the population was 43 percent white, 10.5 percent of more than one race, and 5.3 percent Hispanic or Latino. Less than 1 percent of the population was either Black or African American, Asian, or Pacific Islander, and 2.3 percent were identified as other. This makes it the only majority-minority county in Oklahoma. Adair county had a higher percentage of Native Americans (American Indians) in its population than any other Oklahoma county. As of 2020, its population was 19,495.

The median age of the population was 36.2 years and two-thirds of the county&#x27;s population were either under the age of 18 (28 percent) or between the ages of 25 and 44 (24.8 percent). Of the remaining population, 25.9 percent were ages 45 to 64, 12.9 percent were 65 years of age or older, and 13.2 percent were ages 18 to 24. For every 100 females there were 100.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 98.3 males.

There were a total of 8,156 households and 5,982 families in the county in 2010. There were 9,142 housing units. Of the 8,156 households, 31.4 percent included children under the age of 18 and slightly more than half (52.7 percent) included married couples living together. 26.7 percent were non-family, 14.2 percent had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.8 percent contained a single individual of 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.77 and the average family size was 3.25.

The median income for a household in the county was $27,258, and the median income for a family was $32,930. Males had a median income of $28,370 versus $23,384 for females. The per capita income for the county was $13,560. About 25.3 percent of families and 27.8 percent of the population were below the poverty line, including 36.8 percent of those under age 18 and 18.7 percent of those age 65 or over.

==Politics==











Although most Native American counties tend to skew Democratic, the Cherokee Nation - which Adair County is a part of - has tended to be deeply Republican at the federal level for most its existence, though Southern Democrats have occasionally taken it in strong election years such as 1964 and 1976. No Democrat has won Adair County since Jimmy Carter in 1976.

==Economy==
The county is home to food processing and canning industries; poultry farms; cattle ranches; horse breeders; dog breeders, and strawberry fields.

<text>Interstate 91 (I-91) is an Interstate Highway in the New England region of the United States. It is the primary north–south thoroughfare in the western part of the region. Its southern terminus is in New Haven, Connecticut, at I-95, while the northern terminus is in Derby Line, Vermont, at the Canada–United States border. Past the Derby Line–Rock Island Border Crossing, the road continues into Canada as Quebec Autoroute 55. I-91 is the longest of three Interstate highways whose entire route is located within the New England states (the other two highways being I-89 and I-93) and is also the only primary (two-digit) Interstate Highway in New England to intersect all five of the other highways that run through the region. The largest cities along its route, from south to north, are New Haven, Connecticut; Hartford, Connecticut; Springfield, Massachusetts; Northampton, Massachusetts; Greenfield, Massachusetts; Brattleboro, Vermont; White River Junction, Vermont; St. Johnsbury, Vermont; and Newport, Vermont.

I-91 is long and travels north and south: in Connecticut, in Massachusetts, and in Vermont. I-91 parallels US Route 5 (US 5) for all of its length, and many of the exits along I-91 provide direct or indirect access to the older route. Much of the route of I-91 follows the Connecticut River, traveling from Hartford, Connecticut, northward to St. Johnsbury, Vermont.
=== Connecticut ===

I-91 is the major north–south transportation corridor for the center of the state. It is the main route between the larger cities of New Haven, Hartford, and Springfield, Massachusetts. As such, it is almost always heavily trafficked (especially during rush hour) and maintains at least three lanes in each direction through Connecticut except for a short portion in Hartford at the interchange with I-84, and another in Meriden at the interchange with Route 15. The three cities also serve as Connecticut&#x27;s control points along its length of the Interstate.

I-91 begins just east of Downtown New Haven at an interchange with I-95 (Connecticut Turnpike). At the bottom of the ramp for exit 5, US 5 begins at the first of its many interchanges with the freeway. Leaving New Haven, I-91 follows a northeastward trek into North Haven, where it meets the southern end of the Route 40 expressway. It travels through the eastern part of Wallingford before entering the eastern part of the city of Meriden. In Meriden, about halfway between Hartford and New Haven, I-91 sees a complex set of interchanges with the Wilbur Cross Parkway (Route 15), the Route 66 expressway, and its first spur route, I-691. I-691 provides a westward link to I-84 and the city of Waterbury. Leaving Meriden, I-91 enters Middlesex County as it briefly travels through the western part of Middletown before entering Cromwell, where it has an interchange with the Route 9 expressway.

It then enters Hartford County in the town of Rocky Hill and then enters Wethersfield, meeting the Route 3 expressway, which leads to Glastonbury and the Route 2 expressway via the William H. Putnam Memorial Bridge over the Connecticut River. From there to St. Johnsbury, Vermont, I-91 parallels the river, never more than from its west bank. I-91 then enters the Hartford city limits; in that city, it has a set of interchanges with US 5/Route 15 (Wilbur Cross Highway), which provides access from I-91 north to I-84 east, and from I-84 west to I-91 south via the Charter Oak Bridge. I-91 then has an interchange with I-84, where all other transitions to and from I-84 take place. Before leaving the city limits, a high-occupancy vehicle lane begins that has its own set of interchanges up to exit 38.

I-91 then enters Windsor and meets the western end of its other Connecticut spur route, I-291. At the Windsor–Windsor Locks town line, it meets the eastern terminus of the Route 20 expressway, which provides direct access to Bradley International Airport. A couple of miles further north, I-91 crosses the Connecticut River on the Dexter Coffin Bridge into East Windsor. After traveling through East Windsor and Enfield, it crosses the state line, at milepost 58, into Longmeadow, Massachusetts.

=== Massachusetts ===
I-91 extends through the Pioneer Valley of western Massachusetts paralleling the Connecticut River. I-91 serves as the major transportation corridor through three Massachusetts counties, linking the cities of Springfield, Northampton, and Greenfield. These three cities serve as the control cities listed on guide and mileage signs, along with Brattleboro, Vermont, beginning with the first northbound conventional mileage sign () in Longmeadow.

In Springfield, I-91 has an interchange with I-291 at exit 6 (old exit 8), a spur going eastbound to connect with the Massachusetts Turnpike, for travelers going either east toward Boston or west toward Albany, New York. North of Springfield, I-91 briefly enters Chicopee, there is an interchange with its spur, I-391, at exit 9 (old exit 12) before turning westward to cross the Connecticut River into West Springfield. I-391 provides direct access to Holyoke, while I-91 continues on the western side of the river.

Just after the river crossing, exit 11 (old exit 14) is a major interchange with the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90). Then, I-91 enters the city of Holyoke where exit 12 (old exit 15) is located. Just after an interchange with US 202, (exit 16) I-91 goes from three lanes to two lanes in each direction to the Vermont state line. After a short exit-less stretch, I-91 enters Northampton, passing the Northampton Airport and an oxbow lake. The towns of Hadley and Amherst, home to the main campus of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, are accessible from I-91 exits in Northampton via Route 9.

Continuing north, I-91 enters Hatfield, where it begins a straight section—nearly without a bend in the road. Several exits provide access to US 5 and Route 10 in Hatfield and Whately before entering Deerfield. I-91 has two exits in Greenfield. At exit 43 (old exit 26), the southern end of its overlap with Route 2, there is a rest area and visitor information center for Franklin County. At exit 46 (old exit 27), also in Greenfield, is the northern end of its overlap with Route 2 where access to that road is provided via a directional T interchange and exit and entry ramps on the left side of southbound I-91. Exit 50 (old exit 28) in Bernardston is the last exit in Massachusetts. Beyond exit 50, I-91 continues for about more before crossing into Vermont.

Massachusetts is the only state traversed by I-91 where another numbered highway is concurrent with the Interstate (in this case, US 5, for a spur near the Springfield–Longmeadow town line and Route 2, for approximately in Greenfield).

=== Vermont ===
I-91 traverses the entire length of Vermont and serves as a major transportation corridor for eastern Vermont and western New Hampshire. Due to its routing along the Connecticut River separating the two states, many exits along Vermont&#x27;s length of I-91 feature New Hampshire towns on the guide signs (for example, exit 3, which lists Brattleboro and Keene, New Hampshire, as the points of access). The length of I-91 within Vermont is and has two lanes in each direction the entire way from the Massachusetts state line to the Canada–United States border (nearly two-thirds of I-91&#x27;s length) with 29 Vermont interchanges. The highway&#x27;s rural character and long distances between exits in Vermont are in stark contrast to its south, where exits are more frequent and the road carries four lanes of traffic in each direction at some points. The major control cities in Vermont are Brattleboro, White River Junction, St. Johnsbury, and Newport. When entering northbound I-91 at exit 28 in Derby, the control city sign is for Canada. Of these destinations, only Newport is a city, although the other towns are sizable. In general, the road parallels its predecessor, US 5.

I-91 enters Vermont in the town of Guilford. Just before exit 1 in Brattleboro is the Vermont Welcome Center in Guilford. The first three Vermont exits (northbound) serve the town of Brattleboro. At exit 1, northbound US 5 provides access to stores and a small industrial area before reaching the south end of the town&#x27;s center, where a bridge crosses the Connecticut River into Hinsdale, New Hampshire, via New Hampshire Route 119 (NH 119). Exit 2 (Vermont Route 9 [VT 9]) provides access to the western village of the town (West Brattleboro), then continues west to Marlboro, Wilmington, and Bennington. Brattleboro&#x27;s main retail strip is located at and just south of the exit 3 trumpet interchange and traffic circle. Following VT 9 eastward, one can reach Keene, New Hampshire, in .

After exit 3, I-91 heads north to travel through the communities of Dummerston, Putney, Westminster, North Westminster, Bellows Falls, Springfield, Weathersfield, Windsor, Hartland, North Hartland and White River Junction. White River Junction, listed as a control city on mileage signs as far south as Greenfield, Massachusetts, is where I-91 and I-89 meet and provide access to many points in Vermont and New Hampshire, at exit 10.

North of the interchange with I-89, I-91 continues toward St. Johnsbury and travels through Wilder and Norwich. It enters Orange County, passing through Thetford, Fairlee, Bradford, Newbury, and Wells River. It continues into the Caledonia County communities of Ryegate, Barnet and Waterford, before coming to its next major intersection in St. Johnsbury at the northern terminus of I-93, providing access to the White Mountains of New Hampshire and the Greater Boston area. Along this stretch of highway between White River Junction and St. Johnsbury, towns in Grafton County, New Hampshire, on the other side of the river can also be easily accessed. Just after exit 19, there are three exits for St. Johnsbury, including a major intersection with US 2. Along westbound US 2, the capital of Vermont, Montpelier, is eventually reached from I-91, although I-89 provides Montpelier with immediate Interstate access.

I-91 continues northward, now following the Passumpsic River valley. It travels through Vermont&#x27;s Northeast Kingdom region and the town of Lyndon. Two exits in Lyndon serve the village of Lyndonville and Lyndon State College. After exit 24, I-91 departs US 5, which it had been closely paralleling since the Massachusetts state line. I-91 follows the valley of Miller Run, and there are no convenient services until Barton at exit 25.

The Interstate proceeds through Sheffield. Here, it reaches the highest point on the road, just north of milemarker 150 on Sheffield Heights, elevation .

After leaving Sheffield Heights, it enters Orleans County and follows the Barton River valley north with exits in Barton, Orleans, and Derby. Exit 29 is the final US exit on I-91 just after milemarker 177 at Derby Line. Beyond the exit ramp, northbound motorists enter Canada Customs at Stanstead, Quebec, and continue into Canada on Quebec Autoroute 55 through the Eastern Townships.

As with Connecticut and Massachusetts, US 5 closely parallels I-91 for their entire lengths in Vermont. While paralleling I-91 in Vermont, US 5 is never concurrent with the freeway but remains its own two-lane road, except for a portion in White River Junction where it is a four-lane divided surface arterial.

Traffic and the population of each successive town tend to diminish as the road proceeds northward. The average daily traffic count for 2015 in Vermont were—St. Johnsbury (34,000), Lyndon (17,900), Barton (13,500), and Derby (Canada–United States border) (10,300).

A limited-access highway replacement for US 5 was planned at the federal level starting in 1944. A 1953 Massachusetts plan was funded by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, along with spur I-291 (but not I-391). The Vermont section of I-91 was built in stages from 1958 to 1965. In Massachusetts from Bernardston to Northampton, I-91 follows an abandoned right-of-way of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. To support plans for urban renewal along the &quot;low value&quot; waterfront, the highway crossed the Connecticut River to parallel active New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad tracks on the Springfield side of the river, bypassing West Springfield and Agawam, Massachusetts. Later, this path was perceived as cutting off the city from the river, restricting further commercial development. By 1960, a few miles in Massachusetts were completed, starting from the Connecticut and Vermont state lines. Massachusetts construction was completed from 1960s to 1970.

In the 1950s–1970s, there were plans to extend I-91 to Wading River, New York, from its existing terminus in New Haven, Connecticut, via a crossing of the Long Island Sound (see &quot;Unbuilt Long Island extension&quot; below). Vermont completed its last sections of I-91 in 1978.

Starting in the 1990s, several rest areas were downgraded in Vermont, increasing distances between facilities. In 2008, Vermont closed the Springfield–Rockingham rest areas because of suspected use by drug abusers. In 2009, the northbound rest area in Hartford was closed, creating a gap in on-highway facilities. At the present time, there exist two intermediate rest areas with facilities in each direction, in addition to a welcome center at each end of the state. Several parking areas remain open.

In the early 1990s after the I-284 project was canceled, the exit 44 interchange in East Windsor, Connecticut, was altered as it was designed to be part of the freeway. After alterations, exit 44 connected to US 5 for all traffic to get on and off. As a result, exit 43 was shut down and closed in that same time frame. Exit 43 was a northbound exit/southbound entrance on Route 510/Main Street in East Windsor, which was about away from exit 44.

After the September 11 attacks, a seldom-staffed temporary border patrol checkpoint was installed near White River Junction, Vermont, about from the Canada–United States border.

In 2005, the Massachusetts Highway Department completed a rebuild of on- and offramps in Springfield to reduce accidents caused by weaving near the tightly spaced exits.

=== Impact in Springfield ===
During its construction in the 1960s, I-91 sliced through three Springfield neighborhoods: the North End, Metro Center, and South End, which led to urban decay in the highway&#x27;s vicinity. Springfield&#x27;s portion of the Interstate was widely regarded as positive progress when it was built. However, by the 2010s, it would come to be perceived as disrupting the urban fabric of riverfront neighborhoods while effectively disconnecting the Connecticut River, the Connecticut River Walk Park and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame from everything east of the highway—the majority of the city. I-91 was erected without tunnels, footbridges or other paths, a design choice which poses logistical problems for travel between the riverfront and the remainder of the city. This, in turn, poses problems for businesses that would like to set up along the riverfront. The placement of I-91 has left Springfield&#x27;s riverfront virtually undeveloped, aside from the sliver of land surrounding the Basketball Hall of Fame.

In 2010, the Urban Land Institute made recommendations for how Springfield might reconnect with its riverfront, in order to revitalize the area through urban renewal, suggesting the most cost-effective but also the most development-limiting strategy (constructing pathways beneath I-91). No decision has been reached regarding those recommendations. , academic and civic studies are still underway. Preliminary findings indicate that I-91&#x27;s placement negatively impacts tourism in Springfield&#x27;s Metro Center—the site of many of Springfield&#x27;s historic, cultural, and entertainment venues. Springfield&#x27;s most popular tourist attraction, the riverfront Basketball Hall of Fame, is separated from Metro Center by a stone wall, buttressing an elevated portion of the six-lane I-91 and greatly discouraging travel between the two areas. Academic suggestions that involve the demolition of the current highway and moving it to a less obtrusive site in the city have been proposed, including the demolition of the highway and following the original path suggested, Riverdale Road, and, least obtrusive but still requiring a great deal of work, a plan to construct numerous walkways beneath the elevated highway to better integrate the neighborhoods with the waterfront despite the highway&#x27;s presence.

=== Unbuilt Long Island extension ===

Between the 1950s and 1970s, officials proposed extending I-91 across the Long Island Sound from its current terminus at the I-91/I-95 interchange in New Haven, Connecticut, to Wading River, New York, by means of a bridge over the Long Island Sound, as one of the many Long Island Sound Link proposals. The extension would have continued southward from Wading River to the southern shore of Long Island by the existing County Route 46 (William Floyd Parkway) in central Suffolk County—which would have been updated to Interstate Highway standards. It would also provide easier access to New York City via the Long Island Expressway (I-495), as well as to the Hamptons via New York State Route 27 (Sunrise Highway). The various proposals for this never-built extension were ultimately dropped after a 1979 study of the concept. Following this, officials proposed to connect the New Haven and Shoreham–Wading River areas by means of ferry service across the Long Island Sound—however, the plans to implement these cross-sound ferry services were ultimately mothballed, as well.

Despite the cancelation of the bridge, many Long Islanders are still in favor of building one. In 2000, a survey was conducted by News 12 Networks and Newsday, which found that the majority (63 percent) of Long Islanders were in support of such a project.

In 2016, the proposal was again renewed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, as either a bridge or a tunnel. However, these plans were also dropped, as announced by the New York State Department of Transportation in 2018.

== Exit list ==
All interchanges in Massachusetts were to be renumbered to milepost-based numbers under a project scheduled to start in 2016. However, this project was indefinitely postponed until November 18, 2019, when the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) confirmed that, beginning in the middle of 2020, the exit renumbering project will begin. On March 1, 2021, MassDOT confirmed that the exit renumbering on I-91 will start on March 3, and it will last for two weeks. In 2020, Vermont added &quot;milepoint exit&quot; numbers to existing signs, essentially marking each interchange with two exit numbers. Connecticut will not implement the new exit numbers on I-91 until approximately 2027.

<text>Interstate 93 (I-93) is an Interstate Highway in the New England states of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont in the United States. Spanning approximately along a north–south axis, it is one of three primary Interstate Highways located entirely within New England; the other two are I-89 and I-91. The largest cities along the route are Boston, and Manchester, New Hampshire; it also travels through the New Hampshire state capital of Concord.

I-93 begins at an interchange with I-95, US Route 1 (US 1) and Route 128 in Canton, Massachusetts. It travels concurrently with US 1 beginning in Canton, and, with Route 3 beginning at the Braintree Split on the Braintree–Quincy city line, through the Central Artery in Downtown Boston before each route splits off beyond the Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge. The portion of highway between the Braintree Split and the Central Artery is named the &quot;Southeast Expressway&quot;, while the portion from Boston to the New Hampshire state line is named the &quot;Northern Expressway&quot;.

I-93 ends in Saint Johnsbury, Vermont, at I-91. For most of its length, I-93 indirectly parallels US 3. In New Hampshire, the two highways have several interchanges with each other, as well as a concurrency through Franconia Notch State Park.

===Massachusetts===
I-93&#x27;s southern terminus is at exit 26 (formerly exit 12) of I-95 in Canton, cosigned with US 1 north. At this junction, I-95 north heads to the northwest (cosigned with US 1 south, as well as Route 128, which begins at the interchange), to serve as the beltway around Boston, while I-95 south runs by itself southwest through Boston&#x27;s southwestern suburbs toward Rhode Island. The southernmost of I-93 run east through Boston&#x27;s southern suburbs, passing through Canton and Randolph. In Randolph, I-93 meets the northern end of Route 24 (Fall River Expressway/AMVETS Memorial Highway) at exit 4. I-93 continues east into Braintree, interchanging with Route 3, the major freeway linking Boston to Cape Cod, at exit 7 (known locally as the &quot;Braintree Split&quot;). Route 3 north joins I-93 and US 1, and the highway turns north toward Boston. These first of I-93 follow what was formerly part of Route 128 before it was truncated at the I-95/I-93 junction.
Upon turning northward, the highway is known as the Southeast Expressway, passing through Quincy and Milton before crossing into the city of Boston over the Neponset River. After the Massachusetts Avenue connector exit, the highway officially becomes the John F. Fitzgerald Expressway, also known as the Central Artery, and passes beneath Downtown Boston. A major intersection with the Massachusetts Turnpike/I-90 (exit 16, formerly 20) takes place just south of Downtown Boston. After the massive interchange, motorists use the O&#x27;Neill Tunnel to travel underneath the city and then use the Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge to cross the Charles River. Two exits are located in the tunnel, where the speed limit is . Route 3 leaves the Artery just before the Zakim bridge via exit 18 (formerly 26), and US 1 leaves the Artery just after the bridge, via exit 19 (formerly 27) (no southbound access). From Boston through the rest of Massachusetts, Concord, New Hampshire, appears as the control city on northbound overhead signs. The Artery ends as I-93 continues north out of the city.

I-93 continues through the northern suburbs of Boston, coming to a second interchange with I-95 and Route 128, which run concurrently. Travelers going north can either change over to I-95 north to eventually reach Maine or remain on I-93 toward New Hampshire. Farther north, in Andover, I-93 meets I-495, providing access to Worcester to the southwest and New Hampshire&#x27;s Seacoast Region to the northeast. Just south of the state line, I-93 crosses the Merrimack River into Methuen, where it intersects Route 110 and Route 113 at exit 43 (formerly 46) just north of the river crossing. Between 2014 and 2018, the Route 110/Route 113 junction beneath I-93 was converted from a rotary to a partial cloverleaf, with the new traffic patterns opening in various stages during 2016 and 2017. On I-93 northbound, the exit was split into 43A (formerly 46A) for Route 110 and Route 113 eastbound, and 43B (formerly 46B) for Route 110 and Route 113 westbound. I-93 then interchanges with the western end of Route 213, a connector between I-93 and I-495. I-93 then crosses into New Hampshire after about .

In all, I-93 has 46 (formerly 48) numbered exits in Massachusetts, although, before the mileage-based exit numbering system was implemented in 2021, several numbers were skipped in and near Boston. Several exits were removed from I-93 to address traffic problems in addition to converting the Central Artery from 6 to 8 to 10 lanes, by reducing the combined number of on- and offramps from 27 to 14. Exit 46 (formerly 48) in Methuen, just before the New Hampshire state line, is the highest-numbered exit along the entire route. I-93 once had only 22 exits prior to the rerouting of I-95 onto Route 128. Nearly the entire length of I-93 in Massachusetts carries four lanes in each direction. Average daily traffic volumes on I-93 in the state range from 100,000 vehicles at the New Hampshire border and 150,000 vehicles at the southern end at I-95 to over 200,000 vehicles through Braintree and Quincy.

===New Hampshire===
I-93 travels just over in the Granite State, about two-thirds of the highway&#x27;s total distance. Serving as the main Interstate route in New Hampshire, it connects the state capital, Concord, and its largest city, Manchester. Beyond Concord are the towns of Tilton, Plymouth, and Littleton. I-93 is designated as the Alan B. Shepard Highway, from the Massachusetts line to Hooksett (just north of Manchester at the northern terminus of I-293), as the Everett Turnpike from Hooksett to Concord, and as the Styles Bridges Highway, after the US politician, from Concord to the Vermont line. This section of roadway was constructed between 1961 and 1977.

Between the northern end of I-293 in Hooksett and the beginning of I-89 in Bow, I-93 also carries the northern end of the Everett Turnpike. There is one toll booth along this section, at exit 11 in Hooksett; the toll for passenger cars is $1.00 ($0.50 at the ramp toll booth). This is the only toll collected along the entire length of the highway. I-93 in New Hampshire is also notable for having state liquor stores serve as rest areas, which are passed just after the toll plaza, traveling north. There are separate stores on both sides of the Interstate for travelers in each direction.

I-93 enters New Hampshire at Salem. A rest area and welcome center is available on the northbound side of the freeway, directly before exit 1. I-93 is four lanes wide in each direction for its first , until the split with I-293 and New Hampshire Route 101 (NH 101), where I-93 drops to three lanes before adding a fourth and fifth lane back to the freeway after the interchange. The construction to widen I-93 to four lanes each way between the Massachusetts–New Hampshire border and its junction with I-293 and NH 101 was fully complete as of April 2021.
I-93 and NH 101 run concurrently for about before NH 101 exits to the east as its own freeway, serving Portsmouth and the Seacoast Region. I-93 maintains three lanes of traffic in each direction until the junction with I-89, then is a four-lane freeway through most of its journey northward, with the only exception being the Franconia Notch section.
In the state capital of Concord, I-393 heads directly east (cosigned with eastbound US 4 and US 202), providing another route to the Seacoast Region. Westbound US 4 joins I-93 and runs concurrently with it, crossing the Merrimack River again, until exit 17 for Penacook, about farther north, before exiting westward. Continuing north, I-93 traverses the Lakes Region of New Hampshire and then makes its way north through the heart of the White Mountains Region. I-93 passes through Franconia Notch State Park as a two-lane freeway (one lane in each direction) with a speed limit, designed to reduce I-93&#x27;s impact on Franconia Notch. For the trip through Franconia Notch, I-93 and US 3 run concurrently.

Beyond Franconia Notch State Park, US 3 heads northeastward through the Great North Woods Region, while I-93 runs to the northwest. The final town along I-93 in New Hampshire is Littleton, served by four exits. Many motorist services are available at exit 42. After passing through town, it crosses the Connecticut River into Vermont. The last exit along I-93 is exit 44 for Monroe, through which a rest area and welcome center is accessible to travelers on both sides of the highway.

In 2013, a bill was signed by governor Maggie Hassan to raise the speed limit on I-93 to from milemarker 45 to the Vermont border, with the exception of the Franconia Notch Parkway. The new limit took effect on January 1, 2014.

===Vermont===
I-93 runs for in Vermont, with one numbered exit in the state before ending at the interchange with I-91 in St. Johnsbury in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont. A rest area and welcome center is located along the northbound side of the highway for travelers entering from New Hampshire. The final of the Interstate actually veer to the southwest while traveling northbound. Vehicles bound for Canada can use northbound I-91 to reach the Derby Line–Stanstead Border Crossing at that Interstate&#x27;s end, and northwards into Canada as an autoroute freeway into the Canadian province of Quebec. The portion of I-93 in Vermont parallels both US 2 and Vermont Route 18 (VT 18).

==History==

===Southeast Expressway===

The Southeast Expressway was constructed between 1954 and 1959, at the same time the John F. Fitzgerald Expressway (Central Artery) was built. Its northern terminus is at exit 15 (southbound) or 15B (northbound) (former exit 18; Frontage Road) in South Boston, a former Y interchange where the canceled Southwest Corridor/I-95 was to meet with I-93 and run concurrent northward into downtown. The southern terminus is at the Y interchange (the &quot;Braintree Split&quot;) at exit 7 in Braintree (the former southern terminus of Route 128). A section of the expressway, beginning south of the Savin Hill overpass and ending just before the Braintree Split, utilizes a zipper lane, in which a movable barrier carves out a reversible high-occupancy vehicle lane (HOV lane) on the non-peak side of the highway during rush hour. Most of the right of way for the Granite Railway in Milton and Quincy was incorporated into the expressway.

On August 21, 1969, a train of three runaway locomotives burst out of what is now Cabot Yard, across Frontage Road, and blocked the northbound side of the highway.

===Boston===


The Central Artery, officially the John F. Fitzgerald Expressway, was a section of highway in Downtown Boston constructed in the 1950s and was originally designed as a fully elevated highway. This new highway was greatly disliked by the citizens of the city because it cut the heart of the city in half; cast long, dreary shadows; and was an eyesore to the community. Because of the public outcry, Governor John A. Volpe ordered the southern half of the highway redesigned so that it was underground; this section became known as the Dewey Square Tunnel. With the cancelation of the highway projects leading into the city in 1972 by Governor Francis Sargent, the Central Artery gained the designation of I-93 in 1974. It has also carried the local highway designations of US 1 (since 1989) and Route 3.

By the mid-1970s, I-93 had outgrown its capacity and had begun to deteriorate due to a lack of maintenance. State Transportation Secretary Frederick P. Salvucci, aware of the issues surrounding the elevated roadway, proposed a plan conceived in the early 1970s by the Boston Transportation Planning Review to replace the rusting elevated six-lane Central Artery with a new, more efficient underground roadway. This plan was merged with a long-standing proposal to build a third harbor tunnel to alleviate congestion in the Sumner and Callahan tunnels to East Boston; the new plan became known as the Central Artery/Tunnel Project or the Big Dig.

These new roadways were built during a 12-year period from 1994 to early 2006. The massive project became the largest urban construction project ever undertaken in US history. Construction on the new I-93 segment was not without serious issues: a lengthy federal environmental review pushed the start of construction back from approximately 1990, causing many inflationary increases, while funding for the project was the subject of several political battles between President Ronald Reagan and Representative Tip O&#x27;Neill. Major construction on the new roadway was done while maintaining the old roadway, a step that also greatly increased the cost of the project. The original Charles River crossing, named Scheme Z, was the object of great public outcry similar to that of the building of the original highway. The outcry eventually led to the replacement of Scheme Z with a newer, more sleek cable-stayed bridge and complementing exit for Cambridge, increasing the cost even more.

In Downtown Boston, I-93 is made up of the O&#x27;Neill Tunnel and Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge, which spans the Charles River. The underground construction of the tunnel system was completed as of October 2006; however, repairs continue to many parts of the tunnel due to water leakage because of improper construction of the slurry walls supporting the O&#x27;Neill Tunnel. The former route of the above-ground Artery, so named &quot;the other Green Monster&quot; by Mayor Thomas Menino, was replaced mostly by open space known formally as the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway.

Additional improvements were done in the South Bay section of the highway: the I-90/I-93 interchange was completely redesigned, a new HOV lane extending from the zipper lane in Quincy was added and the South Boston Haul road that was constructed to bypass truck traffic around residential streets in the South End was opened to general traffic.

Hazardous cargos are prohibited from I-93 in Boston over safety issues in the tunnels; these cargos must exit at either the Leverett Circle connector when traveling southbound or at the Massachusetts Avenue exit when traveling northbound.

===Northern Expressway===

The Northern Expressway was constructed from Medford to the New Hampshire border between 1956 and 1963. It was extended through Somerville and Charlestown to the Central Artery, US 1, and the planned route of the Inner Belt Expressway (proposed I-695) between 1965 and 1973. Because it was already under construction, the highway was granted an exception to the moratorium on highway expansion inside Route 128 that was announced in 1970.

I-93 was originally planned with a southern terminus in Cambridge (just north of Boston), where it was to meet the Inner Belt (I-695). However, when that route was canceled and the I-95 section into Boston was canceled and rerouted onto Route 128 in the mid-1970s, I-93 was extended an additional southward down the Central Artery (which had been signed as a concurrency of I-95 and Route 3 before I-95 was rerouted) and the Southeast Expressway (what was then just Route 3) from Boston to Braintree and then west along Route 128 (which was later removed from this section of road in 1997) to terminate at I-95 in Canton.

In an attempt to alleviate rush-hour traffic jams, travel in the breakdown lane of I-93 is permitted between exit 35 (formerly 41) and exit 46 (formerly 43), where the highway currently has three lanes in each direction. This extra travel is permitted on the southbound side on weekdays between 6:00 am and 10:00 am and on the northbound side between 3:00 pm and 7:00 pm to align with commuting hours. However, on most busy days, this fails to prevent traffic delays. The Massachusetts State Police has expressed displeasure with this arrangement, citing that traffic in the breakdown lanes interferes with the ability of emergency vehicles to respond to accidents.

====Rapid bridge replacement project====
In August 2010, in Medford, a section of bridge deck on the northbound side partially collapsed due to age-related structural fatigue. The collapse forced the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) to evaluate the remaining bridges along the corridor, eventually deciding to replace several bridges along the highway in a plan called 93 Fast 14. MassDOT set in motion a plan to replace the superstructure and concrete decks on 14 overpass bridges along that section of the Interstate, using rapid bridge replacement methods. The $98.1-million (equivalent to $ in ) project replaced bridges originally built in 1957 with a set of prefabricated modular concrete bridges in a series of weekend roadway closures. Traffic was diverted into a series of crossover lanes during construction. The main part of the project took place each weekend from June through August 2011, with the exception of the July 4 holiday weekend. One or two bridges were replaced each weekend during the construction time frame. The project was part of the commonwealth&#x27;s Accelerated Bridge Program.

====Methuen Rotary====
Off exit 43 (formerly 46) in Methuen, the surface level traffic circle was rebuilt as part of an overall infrastructure improvement that also included constructing a new bridge carrying the Interstate over the local road, reconstructing on- and offramps to the highway, and realigning the Interstate itself.

===New Hampshire===
As originally envisioned by the federal government, I-93 would have followed the route of present US 3/Northwest Expressway/Everett Turnpike from Boston to Concord. By 1956, the two states had drawn up new plans for I-93 to the east, bypassing the tolled Everett Turnpike from Manchester southward along a new alignment, known as the &quot;Northern Expressway&quot; in Massachusetts and crossing into New Hampshire in Salem. The New Hampshire section south of Hooksett would be named the Alan B. Shepard Highway, named for the first American in space, a Derry native.

The first part of I-93 completed in New Hampshire opened in Salem from the Massachusetts border to exit 2 (NH 38/NH 97) in August 1961. The route was extended gradually northward over the next several years, reaching exit 3 (NH 111) by the end of 1961, as well as a second segment from the I-293/NH 101 west interchange to exit 7 (NH 101 east) at the same time. The two segments were connected in late 1962. This left a gap in I-93, as traffic was directed along NH 101 West and the Everett Turnpike, while the southern segment of I-93 continued on and ended in a stub at exit 7.

By 1963, the route had been completed from the end of the Everett Turnpike section, through Concord and north to Tilton (exit 20), and to NH 104 in New Hampton by 1964 (exit 23) and to Plymouth by 1965 (exit 26), and from there gradually northward until it reached the southern end of Franconia Notch. By 1977, I-93 was completed between exit 7 and the Everett Turnpike in Hooksett, completing the Alan B. Shepard Highway segment of I-93 and closing the gap that had stood for 15 years. The Everett Turnpike section had been built in 1957 and incorporated into I-93 in 1958. After the completion of the Alan B. Shepard Highway portion, the portion concurrent with NH 101 was widened to eight lanes, while the Everett Turnpike section from Hooksett to Concord was widened to six lanes in 1978.

A small segment was also completed from the northern end of Franconia Notch to Littleton prior to 1984, with the final stretch from Littleton to the Vermont border completed by 1984. This left a gap through Franconia Notch, with traffic directed along US 3 between the two sections. For years, debates over how to minimize environmental impact on the road through the notch prevented it being built. As a compromise the Franconia Notch Parkway, a super-two roadway with speed limit, was completed in June 1988, replacing US 3. Originally, this road was not included in I-93, as it had its own exit numbers and was signed &quot;TO I-93&quot;, though, later, the parkway was officially added to the Interstate System despite the substandard conditions and the exits renumbered. The parkway opened in June 1988, replacing Route 3, and grade crossings were replaced by an overpass.

Begun in 2006 and continuing until 2021, the portion between the state border and the I-293 southern terminus was widened to eight lanes; this necessitated the rebuilding and/or relocation of several interchanges. An additional exit has been proposed near milemarker 13 that would include a new connector road to NH 28, effectively bypassing downtown Derry and relieving traffic along NH 102 at exit 4. Construction began in 2023.

===Vermont===
Construction of I-93 in Vermont was completed in 1982. It was planned to be built longer if I-91 did not change its designation eastward in the northeastern part of the state. It was the last Interstate to be built in the state.

==Future expansion==

===Massachusetts plans===
Since 1996, the Massachusetts Highway Department (MassHighway) has studied rebuilding the interchange of I-93 and I-95 in Woburn along the border with Stoneham and Reading. The project was expected to start in early 2017 and cost $267 million but continued community opposition has postponed the project indefinitely. A project to upgrade the interchange of I-93 and I-95 in Canton is also proposed.

An additional 2010 proposal to upgrade Route 24, running southwards from I-93 exit 4 in Randolph to I-195 near Fall River, has also been put off due to studies showing the cost of the project being very high.

MassDOT and its predecessor MassHighway have planned on widening I-93 to a uniform four travel lanes in both directions from the lane drop near exit 35 (formerly 41) in Wilmington to the New Hampshire border since the beginning of the 2000s. The first section of widening will be done as part of the I-93 Tri-Town Interchange Project. The project will construct a new interchange in Wilmington. I-93 will be widened from three to four lanes in each direction from exit 35 (formerly 41) to I-495, a distance of approximately , as the first phase in widening I-93 from exit 35 (formerly 41) to the New Hampshire state line. Early estimates of the entire project place the cost at $567 million.

===New Hampshire plans===
Initial plans to widen I-93 to a uniform four travel lanes in both directions from Salem to Manchester beginning in 2008 were put on hold due to a lawsuit designed to force the New Hampshire Department of Transportation (NHDOT) to update the plans to include other transportation options. Under orders from the US District Court, NHDOT and the US Department of Transportation (USDOT) were required to provide an updated environmental review. The Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) filed a lawsuit in February 2006, hoping to force any expansion plans in the area to include the restoration of commuter rail service between Manchester and Boston. Despite the suit, the exit 1 interchange construction was allowed to undergo upgrading and expansion; other associated projects related to the widening, chiefly around exits 3 and 5, were also eventually allowed to proceed. The whole set of projects were eventually allowed to move forward following an agreement between the state and the CLF that removed the group&#x27;s opposition to construction which does not pose a threat to the environment.

As part of the 2009 stimulus package, New Hampshire was set to receive several million dollars in highway construction funds. One of the projects was the widening of a portion of I-93 between the Massachusetts border and Manchester. Bidding was set to begin in February 2009, with construction slated to begin in late 2009 or early 2010. The plans called for NHDOT to widen the southernmost of I-93 to four lanes in each direction, from the existing two lanes in each direction. In addition, all five interchanges along this length would be upgraded to accommodate larger amounts of traffic, including the replacement of many aging bridges. According to plans filed by the state with USDOT, the project was scheduled to run from 2009 through 2016, with work starting at the Massachusetts line and moving northward to Manchester. The project was designed with an intermodal transit bent; new or improved park and ride facilities were deployed at exits 1, 3, and 5, and a widened median strip was designed to accommodate a planned commuter rail service between Boston and Manchester. As a way to help defray the costs of the expansion, in early 2010, NHDOT made a formal request to the Federal Highway Administration to add tolls to I-93 at the Massachusetts–New Hampshire border. The new toll facility was to be located in Salem, approximately north of the state line, and would cost travelers $2.00 per vehicle. The proposal faced opposition from state legislators in both states, who claimed the tolls would cause severe congestion in the area and lead to an economic burden to local residents. Opponents included US senator Scott Brown. The proposal was eventually dropped in favor of issuing new state bonds to pay for expansion. The new policy was laid out by Transportation Commissioner George Campbell after reviewing the proposal and receiving a promise from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation that it would not be enacting a similar toll on the Massachusetts side of the border.

Plans were announced in 2012 that I-93 would receive new northbound and southbound bridges over I-89 in Bow. To reduce traffic on the southbound bridge, NHDOT added a third lane to ease congestion. The bridges were completed in 2014.

More plans were announced in 2014 that the Hooksett rest areas would be rebuilt. The new rest areas feature a 14-pump Irving Oil gas station, a new New Hampshire liquor and wine outlet, and a few restaurants and shops. The project was completed in 2015.

In Londonderry, a new interchange on I-93 connecting to the adjacent town of Derry were in final planning stages as of June 2020. Construction of exit 4A, to be located approximately north of exit 4 in Londonderry, began in 2022 and is scheduled to be completed in fall 2024. The interchange is part of a larger series of road improvements expected to be completed in 2026.

==Exit list==
Massachusetts converted from sequential to distance-based exit numbering on I-93 in mid-2021. New Hampshire continues to use sequential exit numbering on all of its freeways except at interstate-to-interstate interchanges, which are usually unnumbered (exit 15E to I-393 is an exception to this convention). Vermont added &quot;milepoint exit&quot; numbers to existing signs in 2020, essentially marking each interchange with two exit numbers (except the I-91 interchange, which was previously unnumbered).

<doc id="92124" wikidata="Q192642" url="?curid=92124" title="Myoglobin">
<text>Myoglobin (symbol Mb or MB) is an iron- and oxygen-binding protein found in the cardiac and skeletal muscle tissue of vertebrates in general and in almost all mammals. Myoglobin is distantly related to hemoglobin. Compared to hemoglobin, myoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen and does not have cooperative binding with oxygen like hemoglobin does. Myoglobin consists of non-polar amino acids at the core of the globulin, where the heme group is non-covalently bounded with the surrounding polypeptide of myoglobin. In humans, myoglobin is found in the bloodstream only after muscle injury.

High concentrations of myoglobin in muscle cells allow organisms to hold their breath for a longer period of time. Diving mammals such as whales and seals have muscles with particularly high abundance of myoglobin. Myoglobin is found in Type I muscle, Type II A, and Type II B; although many older texts describe myoglobin as not found in smooth muscle, this has proved erroneous: there is also myoglobin in smooth muscle cells.

Myoglobin was the first protein to have its three-dimensional structure revealed by X-ray crystallography. This achievement was reported in 1958 by John Kendrew and associates. For this discovery, Kendrew shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Max Perutz. Despite being one of the most studied proteins in biology, its physiological function is not yet conclusively established: mice genetically engineered to lack myoglobin can be viable and fertile, but show many cellular and physiological adaptations to overcome the loss. Through observing these changes in myoglobin-depleted mice, it is hypothesised that myoglobin function relates to increased oxygen transport to muscle, and to oxygen storage; as well, it serves as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species.

In humans, myoglobin is encoded by the &quot;MB&quot; gene.

Myoglobin can take the forms oxymyoglobin (MbO2), carboxymyoglobin (MbCO), and metmyoglobin (met-Mb), analogously to hemoglobin taking the forms oxyhemoglobin (HbO2), carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO), and methemoglobin (met-Hb).

==Differences from hemoglobin==
Like hemoglobin, myoglobin is a cytoplasmic protein that binds oxygen on a heme group. It harbors only one globulin group, whereas hemoglobin has four. Although its heme group is identical to those in Hb, Mb has a higher affinity for oxygen than does hemoglobin but fewer total oxygen-storage capacities. The newest discovery reveals that myoglobin facilitates oxygen diffusion down a gradient, enhancing oxygen transport in mitochondria.

==Role in cuisine==
Myoglobin contains hemes, pigments responsible for the color of red meat. The color that meat takes is partly determined by the degree of oxidation of the myoglobin. In fresh meat the iron atom is in the ferrous (+2) oxidation state bound to an oxygen molecule (O2). Meat cooked well done is brown because the iron atom is now in the ferric (+3) oxidation state, having lost an electron. If meat has been exposed to nitrites, it will remain pink, because the iron atom is bound to NO, nitric oxide (true of, e.g., corned beef or cured hams). Grilled meats can also take on a reddish pink &quot;smoke ring&quot; that comes from the heme center binding to carbon monoxide. Raw meat packed in a carbon monoxide atmosphere also shows this same pink &quot;smoke ring&quot; due to the same principles. Notably, the surface of this raw meat also displays the pink color, which is usually associated in consumers&#x27; minds with fresh meat. This artificially induced pink color can persist, reportedly up to one year. Hormel and Cargill (meat processing companies in the US) are both reported to use this meat-packing process, and meat treated this way has been in the consumer market since 2003.

Meat alternatives have used various ways to recreate the &quot;meaty&quot; taste associated with myoglobin. Impossible Foods uses leghemoglobin, a heme-containing globin from soy root nodule, produced as a recombinant protein in &quot;Komagataella&quot; (&quot;Pichia pastoris&quot;) yeast. Motif FoodWorks produces a recombinant bovine myoglobin using &quot;Komagataella&quot; yeast, considered GRAS by the FDA. Moolec Science has engineered a soybean that produces porcine myoglobin in its seeds called &quot;Piggy Sooy&quot;; it was approved by the USDA in April 2024.

==Role in disease==
Myoglobin is released from damaged muscle tissue, which contain very high concentrations of myoglobin. The released myoglobin enters the bloodstream, where high levels may indicate rhabdomyolysis. The myoglobin is filtered by the kidneys, but is toxic to the renal tubular epithelium and so may cause acute kidney injury. It is not the myoglobin itself that is toxic (it is a protoxin), but the ferrihemate portion that is dissociated from myoglobin in acidic environments (e.g., acidic urine, lysosomes).

Myoglobin is a sensitive marker for muscle injury, making it a potential marker for heart attack in patients with chest pain. However, elevated myoglobin has low specificity for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and thus CK-MB, cardiac troponin, ECG, and clinical signs should be taken into account to make the diagnosis.

==Structure and bonding==
Myoglobin belongs to the globin superfamily of proteins, and as with other globins, consists of eight alpha helices connected by loops. Human myoglobin contains 154 amino acids.

Myoglobin contains a porphyrin ring with an iron at its center. A &quot;proximal&quot; histidine group (His-93) is attached directly to iron, and a &quot;distal&quot; histidine group (His-64) hovers near the opposite face. The distal imidazole is not bonded to the iron, but is available to interact with the substrate O2. This interaction encourages the binding of O2, but not carbon monoxide (CO), which still binds about 240× more strongly than O2.

The binding of O2 causes substantial structural change at the Fe center, which shrinks in radius and moves into the center of N4 pocket. O2-binding induces &quot;spin-pairing&quot;: the five-coordinate ferrous deoxy form is high spin and the six coordinate oxy form is low spin and diamagnetic.

==Synthetic analogues==
Many models of myoglobin have been synthesized as part of a broad interest in transition metal dioxygen complexes. A well known example is the &quot;picket fence porphyrin&quot;, which consists of a ferrous complex of a sterically bulky derivative of tetraphenylporphyrin. In the presence of an imidazole ligand, this ferrous complex reversibly binds O2. The O2 substrate adopts a bent geometry, occupying the sixth position of the iron center. A key property of this model is the slow formation of the μ-oxo dimer, which is an inactive diferric state. In nature, such deactivation pathways are suppressed by protein matrix that prevents close approach of the Fe-porphyrin assemblies.

=== The Cocoon ===
The Cocoon is a protective shelter for sexual and domestic violence victims in Wood County, Ohio. Beyond providing housing for survivors and their families, The Cocoon provides medical counsel, legal counsel, and support in finding permanent employment and residence. Organizing for the shelter began in 2000 with Bowling Green State University&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Center and Transformation Project in response to a rise in domestic violence homicides in Wood County. The Cocoon began operation in June 2005, and by 2012 all of its services were being conducted from its undisclosed location. By October 2015, The Cocoon had integrated sexual violence recovery and support as part of its programs.

Like many community organizations, The Cocoon faced sharp budget cuts during the COVID-19 Pandemic. When the United States began lock downs in March 2020, The Cocoon witnessed a forty percent increase in calls from survivors and a fifty percent increase in sexual violence reports. In 2019, At the same time, the Victims of Crime Act’s fund, which provides The Cocoon with approximately half of its funding (approximately $300,000), was cut by thirty-nine percent in October 2020. Although this did not halt operations, it significantly impacted The Cocoon’s ability to provide comprehensive support for survivors.

In 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act granted Woods County $25 million in pandemic relief funds, of which Director Mulls requested $800,000. The Wood County Commissioners approved the request in March 2022. Commissioner Andrew Kalmar noted, “They’ve had a substantial reduction in revenue in the past few years, primarily because they’ve lost grant money from the federal government.”

===Ancestry===
There were several large waves of migration into what it is today Wayne County, Ohio. The first wave was groups of families from New England, migrating westward into what was then the Northwest Territory and then early statehood era Ohio between the 1790s and the 1820s. Most of the settlers who arrived in what would become Wayne County at that time were from New England. They were overwhelmingly Congregationalists, however, in the 1810s several arrived who had become Methodists, Baptists and Presbyterians during the Second Great Awakening. These groups were of English ancestry, being descended from the English Puritans who arrived in colonial New England during the 1620s and 1630s. The English-descended &quot;Yankee&quot; New Englanders established the county in 1812. The second large migration was German immigrants, the Germans settled in Wayne County in large numbers between the 1820s and the 1880s, forming a steady stream of migration into the county during that time. These immigrants were almost exclusively Lutheran. Lastly in the early 1850s a large group of Irish immigrants arrived in the county as part of a large wave of migration entering the United States at that time. This group was overwhelmingly Catholic. Many families currently in Wayne County go back to the early 19th century settlement of the county by New Englanders. Today, many of these same people who cite that they are of &quot;American&quot; ancestry are actually of English descent, however, they have families that have been in the state so long, in many cases since the colonial period, that they choose to identify simply as having &quot;American&quot; ancestry or do not, in fact, know their own ancestry. Their ancestry primarily goes back to the original Thirteen Colonies and for this reason many of them today simply claim &quot;American&quot; ancestry, though they are of predominantly English ancestry. There are also many Irish-Americans in the county. German-Americans have formed the largest single group in Wayne County since the late 1800s.

==Politics==
Prior to 1912, Wayne County was a Democratic stronghold in presidential elections, only voting Republicans twice since 1856. It was a bellwether from 1912 to 1936, but starting with the 1940 election, the county has become a Republican stronghold with Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 being the last Democrat to win the county.

<doc id="92132" wikidata="Q489576" url="?curid=92132" title="Warren County, Ohio">
<text>Warren County is a county located in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 242,337. Its county seat is Lebanon and largest city is Mason. The county is one of Ohio&#x27;s most affluent, with the highest median income of the state&#x27;s 88 counties. The county was established on May 1, 1803, from Hamilton County; it is named for Dr. Joseph Warren, a hero of the Revolution who sent Paul Revere and the overlooked William Dawes on their famous rides and who died at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Warren County is part of the Cincinnati, OH-KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Warren County was established in 1803. The first non-Native American settlers were migrants from New England. During the election of 1860 Abraham Lincoln received 60% of the vote in Warren County, and in 1864 he was reelected with 70% of the vote in the county. From that time on the county was a stronghold of the Republican party, with Ulysses S. Grant going on to carry the county by large margins in both 1868 and 1872.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.5%) is water. The county is a rough square with the sides about long.

===Adjacent counties===
* Montgomery County (northwest)
* Greene County (northeast)
* Clinton County (east)
* Clermont County (south)
* Hamilton County (southwest)
* Butler County (west)

===Boundaries===
Warren County was created by the first Ohio General Assembly in the Act of March 24, 1803, which also created Butler and Montgomery Counties. The act defined Warren County as &quot;all that part of the county of Hamilton included within the following bounds, viz.: Beginning at the northeast corner of the county of Clermont, running thence west with the line of said county to the Little Miami; thence up the same with the meanders thereof to the north boundary of the first tier of sections in the second entire range of townships in the Miami Purchase; thence west to the northeast corner of Section No. 7 in the third township of the aforesaid range; thence north to the Great Miami; thence up the same to the middle of the fifth range of townships; thence east to the County line; thence with same south to the place of beginning.&quot; Originally this included land now in Clinton County as far east as Wilmington.

Clinton County proved a continuing headache to the legislature. The Ohio Constitution requires that every county have an area of at least four hundred square miles (1,036 km2). Clinton County&#x27;s boundaries were several times adjusted in an effort to comply with that clause of the constitution. One of them, the Act of January 30, 1815, detached a strip of land from the eastern side to give to Clinton. That would have left Warren under four hundred square miles (1,036 km2), so a portion of Butler County (the part of Franklin Township where Carlisle is now located) was attached to Warren in compensation. The 1815 act was as follows:
* Section 1—That all that part of the county of Butler lying and being within the first and second fractional townships in the fifth range, and adjoining the south line of Montgomery County, shall be and the same is hereby attached to and made part of the county of Warren.
* Section 2—That eleven square miles 28 km2 of the territory of the county of Warren and extending parallel to the said eastern boundary of Warren County, along the whole length of such eastern boundary from north to south, shall be and the same is hereby attached to and made a part of the county of Clinton.&quot;
Except for the sections formed by the Great and Little Miamis, the sides are all straight lines.

===Lakes and rivers===
The major rivers of the county are the Great Miami River, which flows through the northwest corner of the county in Franklin Township, and the Little Miami River which zig-zags across the county from north to south. There is one sizable lake, the Caesars Creek Reservoir, created by a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam on Caesars Creek in the northeast part of the county in Massie Township.

==Politics==
Warren County has long been one of the most Republican counties in Ohio, and has been since the party was established in the 1850s. Since the first presidential election after its founding, 1856, Warren County has supported the Republican candidate for president all but once, the exception being 1964 when Warren County voted for Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson over Barry M. Goldwater. Jimmy Carter is the only other Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win as much as 40 percent of the county&#x27;s vote. In 2008, Warren County cast the largest net vote for John McCain of any Ohio county. Before the Republican Party was formed, Warren County supported the Whigs.

The Republican trend is no less pronounced at the state level. Since 1869, Warren County has almost always supported the Republican candidate for Governor of Ohio, the exceptions being in 1924 when it supported Vic Donahey, 1932 (George White), 1952 (Frank Lausche), and 1958 (Michael V. DiSalle). However, other than DiSalle, each of these four Democrats, who were all victorious statewide, were conservative Democrats.

In local races, Warren County occasionally elected Democrats for much of the 20th century. In 1976, two of the three county commission seats were won by Democrats, and as late as the 1990s, local elections between Democrats and Republicans frequently remained competitive. However, with the massive expansion of Warren County&#x27;s population in the 1990s, the county turned as solidly Republican at the local level as it already was at other levels, with Republicans typically running unopposed. In elections between 1996 and 2012, in which eight county offices were on the ballot, no Democrat even filed. In November 1999, the last elected Democrat to hold office in Warren County, a member of the Educational Service Center (county school board), lost her seat to a Republican.

===Airports===
Warren County has one public airport, designated as Lebanon-Warren County Airport (I68). The runway is a 4502&#x27; x 65&#x27; paved and lighted north–south runway (01/19), and parallel taxiway. Navigation and communications equipment includes PAPI, AWOS, Pilot Controlled Lighting, and UNICOM. The airport runway, taxiway, and navigation equipment is owned by the county. The county leases a public terminal, but other facilities are privately owned and operated under contract by a Fixed-base operator. The airport serves general and business aviation, but has no commercial airlines.

There are also two privately owned operating airports in the county; Waynesville airport, also known as Red Stewart Field (40I), and Caesar Creek Gliderport (2OH9), both with grass runways. Operations have ceased at two former private paved runway airports, Brownie&#x27;s Lebanon Airport (19I), and Lebanon San Mar Gale (OH79).

===Rail and Bus===
Warren County does not have passenger train service except for a scenic train that runs between Lebanon and Mason. Freight trains still serve Carlisle, and on a limited basis, Monroe, Mason, and Lebanon. Historically, there have been several trains that ran through the county whose stops became cities and villages. These trains include the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway, the Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad, and the Little Miami Railroad whose path is now replaced by the Little Miami Bike Trail. There have been proposals to run commuter trains from Cincinnati to the Kings Island area, but none have ever found sufficient support or funding.

There is no public bus transportation based in Warren County, but there is limited service from Cincinnati to Mason and Kings Island. Middletown also runs bus service to eastern portions of Middletown that are in Warren County.

===Waterways===
There are no commercially navigable waterways in Warren County, but the Warren County Canal did operate in the 19th century as a branch of the Miami and Erie Canal, bringing freight to Lebanon by canal boat. Recreationally, the Little Miami River can be traveled by canoe or kayak for its length through the county, and motorized boating can be done at Caesar&#x27;s Creek Lake.

==Media==

&quot;The Journal-News&quot; circulates in Franklin, Springboro, Lebanon, and Turtlecreek Township. &quot;The Dayton Daily News&quot;, circulates in the northern part of the county. &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; circulates through most of the county while the &quot;Cincinnati Post&quot; abandoned all distribution in the county in 2004.

Among its weekly papers was &quot;The Western Star&quot;, the oldest weekly in the state and the oldest newspaper west of the Appalachians published under its original name. It was closed on January 17, 2013. The &quot;Star,&quot; like the &quot;Pulse-Journal&quot; in Mason and the &quot;Star-Press&quot; in Springboro, was owned by the parent of the &quot;Middletown Journal&quot; and the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot;, Cox Media Group. Other weeklies include the &quot;Franklin Chronicle&quot;.

For a time in the mid-1990s, Lebanon was the home of commercial radio station WMMA-FM, begun by Mike and Marilyn McMurray in 1994. The McMurrays sold to what was then known as American Radio Systems License Corp. a Boston-based chain of stations which also owned Cincinnati stations WGRR-FM and WKRQ (both since sold to various other owners). The new owners moved the station to Hamilton County. In 2010, the only radio station in the county at the time was WLMH-FM, a student-run station at Little Miami High School in Hamilton Township. It went off the air around 2010, and in 2012, the FCC removed WLMH from their database and cancelled their license as a result of no broadcasts for over a year.

Warren County is assigned to the Cincinnati television market, but Dayton television stations treat it as part of their market as well.

<doc id="92134" wikidata="Q47352" url="?curid=92134" title="Eric Cartman">
<text>Eric Theodore Cartman, commonly referred to as just Cartman, is a fictional character in the adult animated sitcom &quot;South Park&quot;, created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. He is voiced by Parker, and is one of the series&#x27; four main characters, alongside Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Kenny McCormick. He first appeared with the name Kenny in the short film &quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot; (1992), and later appeared in the 1995 film of the same title before debuting in &quot;Cartman Gets an Anal Probe&quot;, the first episode of the series, on August 13, 1997.

Cartman is an elementary school student who lives with his single mother, Liane, in the eponymous Colorado town. Cartman is principally characterized by his obesity, his amorality, and his bigoted and especially antisemitic disposition, being described by Parker and Stone as &quot;a little Archie Bunker&quot;. In later seasons, particularly following the fifth season episode &quot;Scott Tenorman Must Die&quot; (in which he turns the titular Scott Tenorman&#x27;s parents into chili, in order to feed it to him as revenge for bullying him), Cartman exhibits increasingly psychopathic and manipulative behavior. The latter is showcased through Cartman&#x27;s various schemes, the majority of which fail either due to opposition from other characters or Cartman&#x27;s own hubris, frequently leaving Cartman in complete humiliation.

Cartman is widely considered to be the most popular &quot;South Park&quot; character, one of the most influential fictional characters of all time, and an American cultural icon. Parker and Stone have stated that he is their favorite character, and the one with whom they most identify. &quot;South Park&quot; has received both praise and criticism for Cartman&#x27;s politically incorrect behavior.

==Role in &quot;South Park&quot;==
Cartman attends South Park Elementary as part of Mr. Garrison&#x27;s class. During the first 58 episodes, he and his classmates were in the third grade, before transitioning to the fourth grade during the fourth season. He is the only child of Liane Cartman, a promiscuous single mother. In the episode &quot;Cartman&#x27;s Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut&quot;, Liane is said to be intersex, being both Eric&#x27;s mother and father. This is later revealed to be an elaborate ruse in the fourteenth-season episode &quot;200&quot;. In the following episode, &quot;201&quot;, it is revealed that Cartman&#x27;s true biological father is Jack Tenorman, a former player for the Denver Broncos whom he arranged to have killed in &quot;Scott Tenorman Must Die&quot;; Scott Tenorman, Jack&#x27;s son, is thus revealed to be Cartman&#x27;s half-brother.

Cartman is distinguished from most of the other children by a wider physical appearance, and is subject to ridicule from others for his obesity. He is most commonly portrayed as an antagonist, with most of his actions driving the events of many episodes. Cartman is alienated by the majority of the other children for his strong amorality, but they are occasionally influenced by his manipulation.

Though Cartman has shared an enmity with all three of his friends, his rivalry with Stan and Kyle has progressed significantly during the show&#x27;s run, with Cartman routinely exposing them to physical endangerment. Cartman, a staunch antisemite, reflects most of his hatred towards the Jewish Kyle, such as deliberately infecting him with HIV (&quot;Tonsil Trouble&quot;). Kyle occasionally exhibits similar behavior in such episodes as &quot;Fatbeard&quot;, wherein Kyle encourages Cartman to travel to Somalia, hoping he will be killed.

His rivalry with the other characters stems from opposition with their personalities. Where Kyle is restrained by firm morals, Cartman indulges in sadistic hedonism. He revealed that he hated Kenny the most in the episode &quot;Jakovasaurs&quot;. He has on numerous occasions made fun of Kenny for being poor. In &quot;Kenny Dies&quot;, Cartman takes advantage of his declining health to get a ban on stem cell research lifted in order to construct his own Shakey&#x27;s Pizza restaurant out of fetus stem cells. However, Cartman also implies that Kenny is his best friend, making their relationship unclear.

Kyle is sometimes an enthusiastic participant in Cartman&#x27;s schemes and he is sometimes seen treating Kyle well, although this is generally to put aside their hatred momentarily for a common goal or for manipulation. Parker and Stone have compared the relationship to that between Archie Bunker and Michael Stivic on &quot;All in the Family&quot;. Kyle has a tendency to make what he thinks are safe bets with Cartman, often losing these bets when the improbable actions promised by Cartman are accomplished. Cartman&#x27;s motivation in this regard is not only monetary gain, but an obsession with beating Kyle, a fixation that ultimately plays a major part in a subplot to the three-part &quot;&quot;. This obsession has been shown to overshadow other goals Cartman wishes to achieve. Cartman has a high sadistic streak towards Kyle, and has repeatedly expressed desire in seeing him suffer, often to extremes. 
In &quot;You&#x27;re Getting Old&quot;, it is suggested that Kyle and Cartman may be developing a genuine friendship, possibly due to the void left by Stan&#x27;s apparent departure. This relationship ends in &quot;Ass Burgers&quot;, however, due to Kyle finding out how Cartman was producing his hamburgers. Cartman&#x27;s resentment of Stan is at times reserved for when Cartman actively proclaims his hatred for both Stan and Kyle as a duo, and his contempt for Stan as an individual is usually due to his annoyance with Stan&#x27;s sensitivity, affection for animals, and relationship with Wendy Testaburger.

Despite being intolerant of other cultures, Cartman displays an aptitude for learning foreign languages. He knows German, and once uses this knowledge to impersonate Adolf Hitler while promoting the extermination of Jews to an oblivious audience that did not speak German, and in interactions with Mexican laborers, such as the episode &quot;My Future Self n&#x27; Me&quot;, seems to speak at least conversational Spanish. This is in service of a running joke in which Cartman displays incredible aptitude at quickly learning almost any topic in service of his schemes, despite being an awful student in a school environment and displaying extreme ignorance about subjects that do not immediately interest him.

Conversely, in &quot;Major Boobage&quot;, Cartman shelters the town&#x27;s cats when they are outlawed; outside of episodes that take place in alternate timelines, this is the only multi-scene plotline in which Cartman acts in a traditionally moral way without any ulterior motive being indicated on-screen.

Cartman will use an awkward pause during a conversation as an opportunity to casually remind Kenny that he hates him. Cartman&#x27;s mischievous treatment of Butters, and the relationship the duo shares, has received significant focus in the more recent seasons of the series. This reflects Parker&#x27;s interest, as the scenes between the two are the ones he most enjoys writing.

Several episodes concern Cartman&#x27;s greed and his get-rich-quick schemes, although his numerous attempts to attain wealth generally fail. His extreme disdain for hippies serves to satirize the counterculture of the 1960s and its influence in contemporary society, reflecting Parker&#x27;s real-life antipathy towards hippies. Though the role is customarily taken by Stan or Kyle, Cartman will occasionally be the one to reflect on the lessons learned during the course of an episode with a speech that often begins with &quot;You know, I&#x27;ve learned something today...&quot;.

==Character==
===Creation and design===

A precursor to Cartman first appeared in the first &quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot; short, dubbed &quot;Jesus vs. Frosty&quot;, created by Parker and Stone in 1992 while they were students at the University of Colorado. In the short, the character resembling Cartman was named &quot;Kenny&quot;, and a variation of the catchphrase &quot;Oh my God, they killed Kenny!&quot; was exclaimed when this character was killed by an evil snowman. The character was composed of construction paper cutouts and animated through the use of stop motion. When commissioned three years later by friend Brian Graden to create another short as a video Christmas card that he could send to friends, Parker and Stone created another similarly-animated &quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot; short, dubbed &quot;Jesus vs. Santa&quot;. In this short, his character first appears as he does in the series, and is given the name &quot;Cartman&quot;, while the character of Kenny appears as the character is depicted today and given Cartman&#x27;s moniker from the previous short. Cartman next appeared on August 13, 1997, when &quot;South Park&quot; debuted on Comedy Central with the episode &quot;Cartman Gets an Anal Probe&quot;.

In keeping with the show&#x27;s animation style, Cartman is composed of simple geometrical shapes and primary colors. He is not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters; his character is mostly shown from one direction, and his movements intentionally jerky. Ever since the show&#x27;s second episode, &quot;Weight Gain 4000&quot; (season one, 1997), Cartman, like all other characters on the show, has been animated with computer software, though he is portrayed to give the impression that the show still utilizes its original technique.

Cartman is usually depicted wearing winter attire which consists of a red coat, brown pants, yellow gloves/mittens, and a yellow-brimmed turquoise knit cap tapered with a yellow pom-pom. He has parted brown hair, and he is seen without his hat more often than the other characters with distinctive headwear. As he is overweight, his body is wider and his hands noticeably larger than those of the other children, and his head is more elliptical. An additional curved line on his lower face represents a double chin.

Parker adduced that he came up with the voice of Cartman while he and Stone were in film class, where they would speak in high-pitched childish voices, which was quite irksome to their film teachers. They would naturally reproduce these voices in the initial seasons of &quot;South Park&quot;. Although he had originally voiced Cartman without any computer manipulation, Parker now does so by speaking within his normal vocal range with a childlike inflection. The recorded audio is then edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch is altered to make the voice sound like that of a fourth grader. Parker says to achieve the effect of Cartman&#x27;s voice, he simply uses the same technique when voicing Stan while &quot;adding a lot of fat to it&quot;.

===Development===

Cartman is partially named after and based on Matt Karpman, a high school classmate of Parker who remains a friend of both Parker and Stone. Cartman is also inspired to some degree by &quot;All in the Family&quot; patriarch Archie Bunker, who is himself inspired by Alf Garnett from &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;, the original British version of &quot;All in the Family&quot;. Parker and Stone are reportedly big fans of &quot;All in the Family&quot;. They alleged in 2008 that creating Cartman as a &quot;little eight-year-old fat kid&quot; made it easier for the two to portray a Bunker-like character after the introduction of political correctness to late-20th century television. While developing the character, Parker noted that everyone either remembers &quot;an annoying fat kid in their pasts&quot;, or &quot;they were the annoying fat kid&quot;. Stone has observed that &quot;kids are not nice, innocent, flower-loving little rainbow children ... they don&#x27;t have any kind of social tact or etiquette, they&#x27;re just complete little raging bastards&quot;.

In the season five (2001) episode &quot;Scott Tenorman Must Die&quot;, Cartman is tricked into buying the pubic hair of a local ninth-grader named Scott Tenorman for $16.12. He then successfully executes an elaborate scheme to publicly humiliate Scott in front of his favorite band Radiohead, by getting Scott&#x27;s parents killed and then tricking Scott into eating them. The show&#x27;s writers debated during production of the episode whether the incident would be &quot;a step too far, even for Cartman&quot;. Parker felt that the act could sufficiently be the culmination of Cartman&#x27;s sociopathic behavior, and would &quot;[set] a new bar&quot; by portraying Cartman as being capable of performing anything short of murder. Fans reacted by ranking it as Cartman&#x27;s &quot;greatest moment&quot; in a 2005 poll on Comedy Central&#x27;s website. It is later revealed in the season fourteen episode &quot;201&quot; that Jack Tenorman, Scott&#x27;s father, was a football player for the Denver Broncos who impregnated Cartman&#x27;s mom, therefore making him Cartman&#x27;s father too.

Parker and Stone, despite being the basis for Stan and Kyle, insist that Cartman is their favorite character, and the one with whom they identify the most.

===Personality and traits===
Cartman uses profanity (as do his friends) to provide a means for Parker and Stone to portray how they believe young boys really talk when they are alone. According to Parker, Cartman does not possess the &quot;underlying sweetness&quot; of the show&#x27;s other child characters. Cartman is shown at times to be completely amoral and remorseless. Cartman, as with Stan Marsh and Kyle Broflovski, is amused by bodily functions and toilet humor, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes.

Cartman is sensitive and in denial about his obesity. Often reasserting Liane&#x27;s notion by exclaiming &quot;I&#x27;m not fat, I&#x27;m big-boned!&quot; and will just as often either threaten to bring harm to anyone who mocks his weight or curse them out in aggravation. He has also had people killed due to his insecurity; after his psychiatrist mocked his weight, Cartman framed the man as a pedophile to his wife, causing her to commit suicide. He views himself as more mature than his fellow friends and classmates, and often grows impatient with their company; despite claiming to be more mature, he will often break down crying childishly and pathetically whenever he feels defeated. This often leads to loud arguments, which in earlier seasons typically end with Cartman peevishly saying &quot;Screw you guys ... I&#x27;m going home!&quot; and then leaving. In an action King&#x27;s College philosophy professor David Kyle Johnson describes as &quot;directed either toward accomplishing his own happiness or the unhappiness of others&quot;, Cartman often feigns actual friendship with his classmates when needing a favor. The lack of a true father figure in his life, and Liane&#x27;s promiscuity and drug use have caused repressed psychological hardship in Cartman&#x27;s life. As a parent, Liane often spoils Cartman, and is largely ineffectual as a disciplinarian. Cartman sometimes commands his mom to do tasks for him, but more often resorts to pleading with her in an ingratiating tone. When neither method works, he resorts to excessive and indecipherable whining, to which Liane usually succumbs. Parker has noted that this is the primary cause for Cartman&#x27;s behavior, stating that Cartman is &quot;just a product of his environment&quot;.
Cartman thrives on achieving ascendancy over others, and exerts his will by demagoguery and by demanding that others &quot;Respect my authoritah!&quot; Cartman has several times declared that his dream is getting &quot;Ten million dollars&quot;, and that if he got it he would be &quot;so happy&quot;. He has shown initiative in taking a businesslike approach to earning money, starting his own &quot;hippie control&quot; and &quot;parental revenge&quot; operations, as well as a Christian Rock and a boy band, a basketball team of crack babies (parody of the NCAA) and his own church.

Cartman&#x27;s anti-Semitism, while mostly limited to mocking Kyle, culminates in the season eight episode &quot;The Passion of the Jew&quot;. In the episode, Cartman, after watching &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; numerous times, deifies the film&#x27;s director, Mel Gibson, and starts an official Gibson fan club, praising Gibson for &quot;trying to express—through cinema—the horror and filthiness of the common Jew&quot;. Cartman&#x27;s interpretation of the film influences him to dress up as Adolf Hitler and lead other fan club members (who are oblivious of Cartman&#x27;s actual intentions) in a failed effort to engage in a systematic genocide of the Jews similar to that of the Final Solution. In the season 10 episode &quot;Smug Alert!&quot;, Cartman anonymously saves Kyle&#x27;s life in an effort to get him and his family to return to South Park from San Francisco, revealing that he craves the animosity shared between the two. Cartman later directs the &quot;evil god&quot; Cthulhu to destroy &quot;most of the synagogues&quot; during the season 14 episode &quot;Coon vs. Coon and Friends&quot;.

Upon hearing his classmates tell him that they hold him in the lowest regard possible and that they could not possibly think any worse of him, a stubborn Cartman misinterprets this act as their attempt to make him feel better, and convinces himself that everyone thinks he is the &quot;coolest kid in school&quot;. In the season 13 (2009) episode &quot;Fishsticks&quot;, Cartman subconsciously believes that he helped in creating a joke that quickly becomes a nationwide sensation, despite the fact that the character Jimmy Valmer writes the joke without any assistance. Carlos Delgado of &quot;If Magazine&quot; noted this as &quot;Cartman being so egotistical that he manipulates the past to serve his own purposes&quot;.

Though he is commonly portrayed as having a chauvinist disrespect for foreign cultures, Cartman is shown at least twice (&quot;My Future Self n&#x27; Me&quot; and &quot;Pandemic&quot;) to be able to speak fluent Spanish (and German).

==Cultural impact==
Cartman is a &quot;South Park&quot; fan favorite, and is often described as the most famous character from the series as well as having a significant influence on comedy and culture. With a headline to their online written version of a radio report, NPR declared Cartman as &quot;America&#x27;s Favorite Little $@#&amp;*%&quot;. &quot;Respect my authoritah!&quot; and &quot;Screw you guys ... I&#x27;m going home!&quot; became catchphrases and, during the show&#x27;s earlier seasons, were highly popular in the lexicon of viewers. His eccentric enunciation of &quot;Hey!&quot; was included in the 2002 edition of &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Catchphrases&quot;. Stone has said that when fans recognize him or Parker, the fans will usually do their imitation of Cartman, or, in Parker&#x27;s case, request that he do Cartman&#x27;s voice.

In 2005, Comedy Central ran a three-night marathon of episodes showcasing what voters had deemed to be his &quot;25 greatest moments&quot;. A two-disc DVD collection entitled &quot;The Cult of Cartman&quot;, which Comedy Central described as &quot;12 classic episodes with Cartman at his very worst!&quot;, was released in 2008.

In a 1999 poll conducted by NatWest Bank, eight and nine-year-old children in the United Kingdom voted Cartman as their favorite personality. This drew the concern of several parent councils who were expecting a character from a television show aimed at children to top the list, to which Stone responded by claiming the results of the poll were &quot;upsetting to people who have an idyllic vision of what kids are like&quot;.

While some in the Jewish community have praised the show&#x27;s depiction of Cartman holding an anti-Semitic attitude towards Kyle as a means of accurately portraying what it is like for a young Jew to have to endure prejudice, other Jews have blamed &quot;South Park&quot; and Cartman for having found themselves surrounded by &quot;acceptable racism&quot;. On November 20, 2008, a Facebook group titled &quot;National Kick a Ginger Day, are you going to do it?&quot; surfaced, suggesting abuse towards redheads. Thousands of internet users signed up as a member of the group, and reports of a feared increase of bullying of red-headed students across Canada soon followed. The group&#x27;s administrator, a 14-year-old from Vancouver Island, said the group was only intended as a joke, and apologized for the offense it caused. The group was inspired by the season nine (2005) episode &quot;Ginger Kids&quot;, in which Cartman incites prejudice towards those with red hair, pale skin, and freckles, a group he calls &quot;Gingers&quot; and claims are inherently evil and without souls. 

Other characters commonly express lessons learned from the antagonistic actions Cartman commonly provokes; this has resulted in these characters giving their opinions on issues such as hate crime legislation, civil liberties, excessive religious devotion, the stem cell controversy, anabolic steroid use, the &quot;right to die&quot; debate, and prejudice. In the season 10 (2006) episode &quot;Cartoon Wars Part II&quot;, Cartman, planning to exploit the public&#x27;s fear of terrorism, seeks to get the Fox television series &quot;Family Guy&quot;, a program he despises, permanently removed from the airwaves when Fox plans to air an episode despite its inclusion of a cartoon likeness of Muhammad. This leads Kyle to give a short speech about the ethics of censorship, which reiterates Parker and Stone&#x27;s sentiments of &quot;Either it&#x27;s all okay, or none of it is&quot; in regards to whether any subject should remain off-limits to satire. Both Cartman&#x27;s commentary and the commentary resulting in response to his actions have been interpreted as statements Parker and Stone are attempting to make to the viewing public, and these opinions have been subject to much critical analysis in the media and literary world.

The book &quot;South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today&quot; includes an essay in which Johnson uses Cartman&#x27;s actions and behavior as examples when discussing the logical problem of moral evil, and another essay by College of Staten Island professor Mark D. White cited the season two (1998) episode &quot;Chickenlover&quot;, in which Cartman is temporarily granted law enforcement powers, in its discussion regarding the command theory of law and what obligates a citizen to obey the law. Essays in the books &quot;South Park and Philosophy: Bigger, Longer, and More Penetrating&quot;, &quot;Blame Canada! South Park and Contemporary Culture&quot;, and &quot;Taking South Park Seriously&quot; have also analyzed Cartman&#x27;s perspectives within the framework of popular philosophical, theological, political, and social concepts. Parker and Stone downplay the show&#x27;s alignment with any particular political affiliation, and deny having a political agenda when creating an episode. In response to the focus on elements of satire in &quot;South Park&quot;, Parker has said that the main goal of the show is to portray Cartman and his friends as &quot;kids just being kids&quot; as a means of accurately showcasing &quot;what it&#x27;s like to be in [elementary school] in America&quot;.

===Recognition===
&quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked Cartman at number 10 on their 2002 list of the &quot;Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters&quot;, 24th on TV Guide&#x27;s &quot;25 Greatest TV Villains&quot;, 198th on VH1&#x27;s &quot;200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons&quot;, and 19th on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest TV Characters&quot; television special in 2004. When declaring him the second-scariest character on television (behind only Mr. Burns of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;) in 2005, MSNBC&#x27;s Brian Bellmont described Cartman as a &quot;bundle of pure, unadulterated evil all wrapped up in a fat—er, big-boned—cartoony package&quot; who &quot;takes a feral delight in his evildoing&quot;. In 2014, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked Cartman first place on their list of &quot;The Top 25 South Park Characters&quot;, commenting that he was &quot;the obvious choice&quot; of number one and that &quot;sometimes the obvious choice is also the right one&quot;. The website stated that despite Cartman being &quot;one of the worst human beings in the history of fiction ... he&#x27;s the most loathsome character we&#x27;ve ever loved.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; concluded by calling him &quot;the biggest contribution to the world of animated characters that South Park has made – and that&#x27;s saying something.&quot; In 2020, &quot;Paste&quot; ranked Cartman as #17 of their &quot;The 50 Best Cartoon Characters of All Time&quot;.

==In other media==
* Cartman has a major role in &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot;, the full-length film based on the series, and appeared on the film&#x27;s soundtrack singing the same musical numbers performed in the movie. As a tribute to the Dead Parrot sketch, a short that features Cartman attempting to return a dead Kenny to a shop run by Kyle aired during a 1999 BBC television special commemorating the 30th anniversary of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;. Cartman is also featured in the documentary film &quot;The Aristocrats&quot;, telling his version of the film&#x27;s titular joke to Stan, Kyle, and Kenny, and in &quot;The Gauntlet&quot;, a short spoofing both &quot;Gladiator&quot; and &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; that aired during the 2000 MTV Movie Awards.
* Cartman is a central character in &quot;South Park: Post COVID&quot;, the first television special made for Paramount+. In the special, which takes place 40 years after the events of the series, Cartman is depicted as having converted to Orthodox Judaism, becoming a rabbi with a wife and three children, much to the chagrin of Kyle.
* Cartman returns in the follow-up special &quot;South Park: Post COVID: The Return of COVID&quot;. In it, Cartman has thoroughly convinced his family that Kyle is out to break them apart on the grounds of being anti-Jewish (in reality, Kyle intends to go back in time to try and alter the events of the COVID outbreak and Cartman is concerned that this will cost him his family). In retaliation, Cartman organizes a rebellion group consisting of Butters, Clyde and Scott Malkinson with the sole purpose of going back in time and killing him. After a brief altercation with Kyle himself, Cartman changes his mind about the plan and kills an adult Clyde in the past, who volunteered to attempt to kill Kyle, allowing Stan and Kyle to help their younger selves save their friendship before the pandemic kicked off. In the now-altered future, Cartman is shown to be alcoholic, homeless, and bitter.
* For their 2007 Snakes &amp; Arrows tour, the rock band Rush commissioned a short, video introduction for the song &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;. Cartman, dressed in a long wig to look like singer Geddy Lee, sings his own, personal, version of the song&#x27;s lyrics prompting the usual outrage from Kyle. The video can be seen on the band&#x27;s &quot;Snakes &amp; Arrows&quot; concert video.
* In 2002, Cartman became the main protagonist of a series of promotional videos for the Los Angeles Kings of the NHL, which are played on the big-screen TVs inside of Staples Center where the character ridicules the mascots of rival teams and reacts to various aspects of the game.
* Short clips of Cartman introducing the starting lineup for the University of Colorado football team were featured during ABC&#x27;s coverage of the 2007 match-up between the University of Colorado and the University of Nebraska.
* In 2008, Parker, as Cartman, gave answers to a Proust Questionnaire conducted by Julie Rovner of NPR.
* Parker performs as Cartman on tracks for &quot;Chef Aid: The South Park Album&quot; and &quot;Mr. Hankey&#x27;s Christmas Classics&quot;. Cartman also appears in six &quot;South Park&quot;-related video games: In &quot;South Park&quot;, Cartman is controlled by the player through the first-person shooter mode who attempts to ward off enemies from terrorizing the town of South Park. In &quot;South Park: Chef&#x27;s Luv Shack&quot;, a user has the option of playing as Cartman when participating in the game&#x27;s several &quot;minigames&quot; based on other popular arcade games. In the racing game &quot;South Park Rally&quot;, a user can race as Cartman against other users playing as other characters, while choosing to place him in any of a variety of vehicles. In &quot;South Park Let&#x27;s Go Tower Defense Play!&quot;, Cartman can be selected as a playable character used to establish a tower defense against the game&#x27;s antagonists. In &quot;South Park: The Stick of Truth&quot;, Cartman is the leader of one of two tribes in South Park, at war over the Stick of Truth. He plays a similar role in this game&#x27;s superhero themed sequel, &quot;South Park: The Fractured but Whole&quot;, where he leads the Coon &amp; Friends team.

<text>Ornithine is a non-proteinogenic α-amino acid that plays a role in the urea cycle. Ornithine is abnormally accumulated in the body in ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. The radical is ornithyl.

==Role in urea cycle==
-Ornithine is one of the products of the action of the enzyme arginase on -arginine, creating urea. Therefore, ornithine is a central part of the urea cycle, which allows for the disposal of excess nitrogen. Ornithine is recycled and, in a manner, is a catalyst. First, ammonia is converted into carbamoyl phosphate () by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. Ornithine transcarbamylase catalyzes the reaction between carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine to form citrulline and phosphate (Pi). Another amino group is added from aspartate, producing arginine and denitrogenated fumarate. The resulting arginine (a guanidinium compound) is hydrolysed back to ornithine, producing urea. The amino groups of urea come from the ammonia and aspartate, and the nitrogen in ornithine remains intact.

Ornithine is not an amino acid coded for by DNA, that is, not proteinogenic. However, in mammalian non-hepatic tissues, the main use of the urea cycle is in arginine biosynthesis, so, as an intermediate in metabolic processes, ornithine is quite important.
==Other reactions==
Ornithine, via the action of ornithine decarboxylase (E.C. 4.1.1.17), is the starting point for the synthesis of polyamines such as putrescine.

In bacteria, such as &quot;E. coli&quot;, ornithine can be synthesized from -glutamate.

==Research==
===Exercise fatigue===
-Ornithine supplementation attenuated fatigue in subjects in a placebo-controlled study using a cycle ergometer. The results suggested that -ornithine has an antifatigue effect in increasing the efficiency of energy consumption and promoting the excretion of ammonia.

===Weightlifting supplement===
Amino acid supplements, including -ornithine, are frequently marketed to bodybuilders and weightlifters with claims for increasing levels of human growth hormone (HGH), muscle mass, and strength. A 1993 short 4-day clinical study reported that -ornithine in combination with -arginine and -lysine at 2 g/d each did not increase HGH. A review from 2002 on the topic concluded &quot;The use of specific amino acids to stimulate GH release by athletes is not recommended.&quot;

===Cirrhosis===
-Ornithine -aspartate (LOLA), a stable salt of ornithine and aspartic acid, has been used in the treatment of cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy.

<text>Syncom (for &quot;synchronous communication satellite&quot;) started as a 1961 NASA program for active geosynchronous communication satellites, all of which were developed and manufactured by the Space and Communications division of Hughes Aircraft Company (now the Boeing Satellite Development Center). Syncom 2, launched in 1963, was the world&#x27;s first geosynchronous communications satellite. Syncom 3, launched in 1964, was the world&#x27;s first geostationary satellite.

In the 1980s, the series was continued as Syncom IV with some much larger satellites, also manufactured by Hughes. They were leased to the United States military under the Leasat program.

==Syncom 1, 2 and 3==
=== Common features ===
The three early Syncom satellites were experimental spacecraft built by Hughes Aircraft Company&#x27;s facility in Culver City, California, by a team led by Harold Rosen, Don Williams, and Thomas Hudspeth. All three satellites were cylindrical in shape, with a diameter of about and a height of about . Pre-launch fueled masses were , and orbital masses were with a payload. They were capable of emitting signals on two transponders at just 2 W. Thus, Syncom satellites were only capable of carrying a single two-way telephone conversation, or 16 Teletype connections. all three satellites are still in orbit, although no longer functioning.

=== Syncom 1 ===
Syncom 1 was intended to be the first geosynchronous communications satellite. It was launched on February 14, 1963, with the Delta B #16 launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral, but was lost on the way to geosynchronous orbit due to an electronics failure. Seconds after the apogee kick motor for circularizing the orbit was fired, the spacecraft fell silent. Later telescopic observations verified the satellite was in an orbit with a period of almost 24 hours at a 33° inclination.

=== Syncom 2 ===
Syncom 2 was launched by NASA on July 26, 1963 with the Delta B #20 launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral. The satellite successfully kept station at the altitude calculated by Herman Potočnik Noordung in the 1920s.

During the first year of Syncom 2 operations, NASA conducted voice, teletype, and facsimile tests, as well as 110 public demonstrations to show the capabilities of this satellite and invite feedback. In August 1963, President John F. Kennedy in Washington, D.C., telephoned Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa aboard (the first satellite communication ship) docked in Lagos Harbor—the first live two-way call between heads of government by satellite. The &quot;Kingsport&quot; acted as a control station and uplink station.

Syncom 2 also relayed a number of test television transmissions from Fort Dix, New Jersey to a ground station in Andover, Maine, beginning on September 29, 1963. Although it was low-quality video with no audio, it was the first successful television transmission through a geosynchronous satellite.

=== Syncom 3 ===
Syncom 3 was the first geostationary communication satellite, launched on August 19, 1964 with the Delta D #25 launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral. The satellite, in orbit near the International Date Line, had the addition of a wideband channel for television and was used to telecast the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo to the United States. Although Syncom 3 is sometimes credited with the first television program to cross the Pacific Ocean, the Relay 1 satellite first broadcast television from the United States to Japan on November 22, 1963.

=== Transfer to Department of Defense control ===
By the end of 1964, Syncoms 2 and 3 had completed NASA&#x27;s R&amp;D experiments. On January 1, 1965, NASA transferred operation of the satellites to the United States Department of Defense (DOD) along with telemetry, command stations, and range and rangefinding equipment. DOD had, in fact, provided the communications ground stations used to relay transmissions via the two Syncoms since their launch. DOD agreed to provide telemetry and ranging data of continuing scientific and engineering interest.

In 1965, Syncom 3 was implemented to support the DOD&#x27;s communications in Vietnam.

Turned off in 1969, Syncom 3 remains in geosynchronous orbit In 50 years it has drifted east, to longitude 123 W.

== Syncom IV (Leasat) ==



The five satellites of the 1980s Leasat (Leased Satellite) program (Leasat F1 through Leasat F5) were alternatively named Syncom IV-1 to Syncom IV-5 and called HS 381 by the manufacturer. These satellites were considerably larger than Syncoms 1 to 3, weighing 1.3 tonnes each (over 7 tonnes with launch fuel). At , the satellites were the first to be designed for launch from the Space Shuttle payload bay, and were deployed like a Frisbee. The satellites are 30 rpm spin-stabilized with a despun communications and antenna section. They were made with a solid rocket motor for initial perigee burn and hydrazine propellant for station keeping and spin stabilization. The communications systems offers a wideband UHF channel (500 kHz bandwidth), six relay 25 kHz channels, and five narrowband 5 kHz channels. This is in addition to the fleet broadcast frequency, which is in the military&#x27;s X-band. The system was used by military customers in the US and later in Australia. Most of the satellites were retired in the 1990s, but one would remain operational until 2015. During the First Gulf War, Leasat would be used for personal communications between Secretary of State James Baker and President George H. W. Bush, but was more typically used by &quot;mobile air, surface, subsurface, and fixed earth stations of the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Army.&quot;

Hughes was contracted to provide a worldwide communications system based on four satellites, one over the continental United States (CONUS), and one each over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, spaced about 90 degrees apart. Five satellites were ordered, with one as a replacement. Also part of the contract were the associated control systems and ground stations. The lease contracts were typically for five-year terms, with the lessee having the opportunity to extend the lease or to purchase the equipment outright. The US Navy was the original lessee.

Leasat F1&#x27;s launch was canceled just prior to lift-off, and F2 became the first into orbit on August 30, 1984 aboard on shuttle mission STS-41-D. F2 was largely successful, but its wideband receiver was out of commission after only four months. F1 was launched successfully on November 8, 1984 aboard STS-51-A. This was followed on April 12, 1985 by Leasat F3 on STS-51-D. F3&#x27;s launch was declared a failure when the satellite failed to start its maneuver to geostationary orbit once released from . Attempts by Shuttle astronauts to activate F3 with a makeshift &quot;flyswatter&quot; were unsuccessful. The satellite was left in low Earth orbit, and the Space Shuttle returned to Earth. This failure made front-page news in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Hughes had an insurance policy on the satellite, and so claimed a total loss for the spacecraft of about $200 million, an amount underwritten by numerous parties.

However, with another satellite planned to be launched, it was determined that a space walk by a subsequent Shuttle crew might be able to &quot;wake&quot; the craft. The best guess was that a switch had failed to turn on the satellite. A &quot;bypass box&quot; was hastily constructed, NASA was excited to offer assistance, the customer was supportive, and the insurance underwriters agreed to fund the first ever attempt at space salvage.

On August 27, 1985 was again used to launch Leasat F4, and during the same mission (STS-51-I) captured the 15,000 lb stricken F3. Astronaut James van Hoften grappled and then spun down the F3 satellite. After the bypass box was installed by van Hoften and Bill Fisher, van Hoften manually spun the satellite up. Once released, the F3 successfully powered up, fired its perigee motor and obtained a geostationary orbit. (This scenario would play out again in 1992 with Intelsat 603 and .) While F3 was now operational, Leasat F4 soon failed and was itself declared a loss after only 40 hours of RF communications.

The stricken F4 did not remain a complete failure. Data from F4&#x27;s failure permitted the saving of F1 from a premature failure. Since all of the Leasats are spin-stabilized, they have a bearing that connects the non-rotating and rotating parts of the spacecraft. After F4&#x27;s communication failure, it suffered a spin lock while attempting to jostle the communications payload: the spun and despun sections locked together. Remembering this second failure of F4, and with F1 beginning to wear out at the spin bearing, it was decided to &quot;flip&quot; F1 every six months to keep the payload in the sun. Thus F1 went on to operate smoothly for its remaining life and never encountered a locked despun section.

Leasat F4 was subsequently powered down and moved to a graveyard orbit with a large amount of station keeping fuel in reserve. This was fortuitous; when another satellite suffered a loss of its fuel ten years later, Hughes engineers pioneered the use of alternative propellants with Leasat F4. Long after its primary mission had failed, F4 was powered back on to test whether a satellite could be kept on station using nonvolatile propellants. F4 was used to perform numerous tests, including maneuvers with oxidizer for propulsion once the hydrazine ran out.

The fifth and last Leasat (F5), which was built as a spare, was successfully launched by mission STS-32 on January 9, 1990. The last active Leasat, it was officially decommissioned on September 24, 2015, at 18:25:13 UTC. F5 was one of the longest-serving and most successful commercial satellites. Towards the end of its 25-year life, F5 had been leased by the Australian Defence Force for UHF service.

<doc id="92149" wikidata="Q191000" url="?curid=92149" title="Oud">
<text>The oud (, ) is a Middle Eastern short-neck lute-type, pear-shaped, fretless stringed instrument (a chordophone in the Hornbostel–Sachs classification of instruments), usually with 11 strings grouped in six courses, but some models have five or seven courses, with 10 or 13 strings respectively.

The oud is very similar to other types of lute, and to Western lutes which developed out of the Medieval Islamic oud. Similar instruments have been used in the Middle East, some predating Islam, such as the barbat from Persia. Different versions of the oud are used in Arabia, Turkey, and other Middle Eastern and Balkan regions. The oud, as a fundamental difference with the western lute, has no frets and a smaller neck. It is the direct successor of the Persian barbat lute. The oldest surviving oud is thought to be in Brussels, at the Museum of Musical Instruments.

An early description of the &quot;modern&quot; oud was given by 11th-century musician, singer and author Al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham () in his compendium on music &quot;Ḥāwī al-Funūn wa Salwat al-Maḥzūn&quot;. The first known complete description of the &quot;‛ūd&quot; and its construction is found in the epistle &quot;Risāla fī-l-Luḥūn wa-n-Nagham&quot; by 9th-century philosopher of the Arabs Yaʻqūb ibn Isḥāq al-Kindī. Kindī&#x27;s description stands thus:

[and the] length [of the &quot;‛ūd&quot;] will be: thirty-six joint fingers—with good thick fingers—and the total will amount to three &quot;ashbār&quot;. And its width: fifteen fingers. And its depth seven and a half fingers. And the measurement of the width of the bridge with the remainder behind: six fingers. Remains the length of the strings: thirty fingers and on these strings take place the division and the partition, because it is the sounding [or &quot;the speaking&quot;] length. This is why the width must be [of] fifteen fingers as it is the half of this length. Similarly for the depth, seven fingers and a half and this is the half of the width and the quarter of the length [of the strings]. And the neck must be one third of the length [of the speaking strings] and it is: ten fingers. Remains the vibrating body: twenty fingers. And that the back (soundbox) be well rounded and its &quot;thinning&quot; (kharţ) [must be done] towards the neck, as if it had been a round body drawn with a compass which was cut in two in order to extract two &quot;‛ūds&quot;.

In Pre-Islamic Persia, Arabia and Mesopotamia, the stringed instruments had only three strings, with a small musical box and a long neck without any tuning pegs. But during the Islamic era the musical box was enlarged, a fourth string was added, and the base for the tuning pegs (Bunjuk) or pegbox was added. In the first centuries of (pre-Islamic) Arabian civilisation, the stringed instruments had four courses (one string per course—double-strings came later), tuned in successive fourths. Curt Sachs said they were called (from lowest to highest pitch) &quot;bamm&quot;, &quot;maṭlaṭ&quot;, &quot;maṭnā&quot; and &quot;zīr&quot;. &quot;As early as the ninth century&quot; a fifth string &quot;ḥād&quot; (&quot;sharp&quot;) was sometimes added &quot;to make the range of two octaves complete&quot;. It was highest in pitch, placed lowest in its positioning in relation to other strings. Modern tuning preserves the ancient succession of fourths, with adjunctions (lowest or highest courses), which may be tuned differently following regional or personal preferences. Sachs gives one tuning for this arrangement of five pairs of strings, d, e, a, d&#x27;, g&#x27;.

Historical sources indicate that Ziryab (789–857) added a fifth string to his oud. He was well known for founding a school of music in Andalusia, one of the places where the oud or lute entered Europe. Another mention of the fifth string was made by Al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham in &quot;Ḥāwī al-Funūn wa Salwat al-Maḥzūn&quot;.

==Names and etymology==

The (&quot;&quot;) literally denotes a thin piece of wood similar to the shape of a straw. It may refer to the wooden plectrum traditionally used for playing the oud, to the thin strips of wood used for the back, or to the wooden soundboard that distinguishes it from similar instruments with skin-faced bodies. Henry George Farmer considers the similitude between &quot; &quot;and &quot;al-ʿawda&quot; (&quot;the return&quot; – of bliss).

Multiple theories have been proposed for the origin of the Arabic name oud. The word oud (عود) means &quot;from wood&quot; and &quot;stick&quot; in Arabic. In 1940 Curt Sachs contradicted or refined that idea, saying oud meant &quot;flexible stick&quot;, not wood. A western scholar of Islamic musical subjects, Eckhard Neubauer, suggested that &quot;oud&quot; may be an Arabic borrowing from the Persian word &quot;rōd&quot; or &quot;rūd&quot;, which meant string. Another researcher, archaeomusicologist Richard J. Dumbrill, suggests that &quot;rud&quot; came from the Sanskrit &quot;rudrī&quot; (रुद्री, meaning &quot;string instrument&quot;) and transferred to Arabic (a Semitic language) through a Semitic language. While the authors of these statements about the meanings or origins of the word may have accessed linguistic sources, they were not linguists.

However, another theory according to Semitic language scholars, is that the Arabic &quot;ʿoud&quot; is derived from Syriac &quot;ʿoud-a&quot;, meaning &quot;wooden stick&quot; and &quot;burning wood&quot;—cognate to Biblical Hebrew &quot;’ūḏ&quot;, referring to a stick used to stir logs in a fire.

Names for the instrument in different languages include &#x27; (, plural: &#x27;), , Syriac: &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27; (although the barbat is a different lute instrument), or , Azeri: &quot;ud&quot;, and 𐒋𐒓𐒆 or &quot;kaban&quot; 𐒏𐒖𐒁𐒖𐒒.

==History==
===Musical instruments from pre-history===

The complete history of the development of the lute family is not fully compiled at this date, only some of it. The highly influential organologist Curt Sachs distinguished between the &quot;long-necked lute&quot; and the short-necked variety. Douglas Alton Smith argues the long-necked variety should not be called lute at all because it existed for at least a millennium before the appearance of the short-necked instrument that eventually evolved into what is now known as the lute.

Musicologist Richard Dumbrill today uses the word more categorically to discuss instruments that existed millennia before the term &quot;lute&quot; was coined. Dumbrill documented more than 3000 years of iconographic evidence for the lutes in Mesopotamia, in his book &quot;The Archaeomusicology of the Ancient Near East&quot;. According to Dumbrill, the lute family included instruments in Mesopotamia prior to 3000 BC. He points to a cylinder seal as evidence; dating from 3100 BC or earlier (now in the possession of the British Museum); the seal depicts on one side what is thought to be a woman playing a stick &quot;lute&quot;. Like Sachs, Dumbrill saw length as distinguishing lutes, dividing the Mesopotamian lutes into a long-necked variety and a short. He focuses on the longer lutes of Mesopotamia, and similar types of related necked chordophones that developed throughout the ancient world: Greek, Egyptian (in the Middle Kingdom), Elamites, Hittite, Roman, Bulgar, Turkic, Indian, Chinese, Armenian/Cilician, Canaanite/Phoenician, Israelite/Judean, and various other cultures. He names among the long lutes, the pandura, the panduri, tambur and tanbur.

The line of short-necked lutes was further developed to the east of Mesopotamia, in Bactria and Gandhara, into a short, almond-shaped lute. Curt Sachs talked about the depictions of Gandharan lutes in art, where they are presented in a mix of &quot;Northwest Indian art&quot; under &quot;strong Greek influences&quot;. The short-necked lutes in these Gandhara artworks were &quot;the venerable ancestor of the Islamic, the Sino-Japanese and the European lute families.&quot; He described the Gandhara lutes as having a &quot;pear-shaped body tapering towards the short neck, a frontal stringholder, lateral pegs, and either four or five strings.&quot; The oldest images of short-necked lutes from the area that Sachs knew of were &quot;Persian figurines of the 8th century B.C.,&quot; found in excavations at Suza, but he knew of nothing connecting these to the Oud-related Gandharan art 8 centuries later.

===Spread of oud to Europe===

When the Umayyads conquered Hispania in 711, they brought their ud along. An oud is depicted as being played by a seated musician in Qasr Amra of the Umayyad dynasty, one of the earliest depictions of the instrument as played in early Islamic history.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, many musicians and artists from across the Islamic world flocked to al-Andalus. Among them was Abu l-Hasan ‘Ali Ibn Nafi‘ (789–857), a prominent musician who had trained under Ishaq al-Mawsili () in Baghdad and was exiled to al-Andalus before 833 AD. He taught and has been credited with adding a fifth string to his oud and with establishing one of the first schools of music in Córdoba.

By the 11th century, Muslim Iberia had become a center for the manufacture of instruments. These goods spread gradually to Provence, influencing French troubadours and trouvères and eventually reaching the rest of Europe. While Europe developed the lute, the &quot;oud&quot; remained a central part of Arab music, and broader Ottoman music as well, undergoing a range of transformations.

Although the major entry of the short lute was in western Europe, leading to a variety of lute styles, the short lute entered Europe in the East as well; as early as the sixth century, the Bulgars brought the short-necked variety of the instrument called Komuz to the Balkans.

===Origins theory from religious and philosophical beliefs===

According to Abū Ṭālib al-Mufaḍḍal (a-n-Naḥawī al-Lughawī) ibn Salma (9th century), who himself refers to Hishām ibn al-Kullā, the oud was invented by Lamech, the descendant of Adam and Cain. Another hypothetical attribution says that its inventor was Mani. Ibn a-ṭ-Ṭaḥḥān adds two possible mythical origins: the first involves the Devil, who would have lured the &quot;People of David&quot; into exchanging (at least part of) their instruments with the oud. He writes himself that this version is not credible. The second version attributes, as in many other cultures influenced by Greek philosophy, the invention of the oud to &quot;Philosophers&quot;.

====Central Asia====
One theory is that the oud originated from the Persian instrument called a &quot;barbat &quot;(Persian: بربت ) or &quot;barbud&quot;, a lute indicated by Marcel-Dubois to be of Central Asian origin. The earliest pictorial image of the barbat dates back to the 1st century BC from ancient northern Bactria and is the oldest evidence of the existence of the barbat. Evidence of a form of the barbaṭ is found in a Gandhara sculpture from the 2nd-4th centuries AD which may well have been introduced by the Kushan aristocracy, whose influence is attested in Gandharan art. The name barbat itself meant &quot;short-necked lute&quot; in Pahlavi, the language of the Sasanian Empire, through which the instrument came west from Central Asia to the Middle East, adopted by the Persians.

The barbat (possibly known as mizhar, kirān, or muwatter, all skin topped versions) was used by some Arabs in the sixth century. At the end of the 6th century, a wood topped version of the Persian-styled instrument was constructed by al Nadr, called &quot;ūd&quot;, and introduced from Iraq to Mecca. This Persian-style instrument was being played there in the seventh century. Sometime in the seventh century it was modified or &quot;perfected&quot; by Mansour Zalzal, and the two instruments (barbat and &quot;ūd shabbūt&quot;) were used side by side into the 10th century, and possibly longer. The two instruments have been confused by modern scholars looking for examples, and some of the ouds identified may possibly be barbats. Examples of this cited in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Islam&quot; include a lute in the Cantigas de Santa Maria and the frontispiece from &quot;The Life and Times of Ali Ibn Isa&quot; by Harold Bowen.

The oldest pictorial record of a short-necked lute-type &quot;vīnā&quot; dates from around the 1st to 3rd centuries AD. The site of origin of the oud seems to be Central Asia. The ancestor of the oud, the barbat was in use in pre-Islamic Persia. Since the Safavid period, and perhaps because of the name shift from barbat to oud, the instrument gradually lost favor with musicians.

The Turkic peoples had a similar instrument called the &quot;kopuz&quot;. This instrument was thought to have magical powers and was brought to wars and used in military bands. This is noted in the Göktürk monument inscriptions. The military band was later used by other Turkic state&#x27;s armies and later by Europeans.

==Types==

===Arabian oud, Turkish oud, and Persian barbat===
Modern-day ouds fall into three categories: Arabian, Turkish, and Persian, the last also being known as barbat.

This distinction is not based solely on geography; the Arabic oud is found not only in the Arabian Peninsula but throughout the Arab world. Turkish ouds have been played by Anatolian Greeks, where they are called outi, and in other locations in the Mediterranean. The Iraqi oud, Egyptian oud and Syrian oud, are normally grouped under the term &#x27;Arabian oud&#x27; because of their similarities, although local differences may occur, notably with the Iraqi oud. However, all these categories are very recent, and do not do justice to the variety of ouds made in the 19th century, and also today.

Arabian ouds are normally larger than their Turkish and Persian counterparts, producing a fuller, deeper sound, whereas the sound of the Turkish oud is more taut and shrill, not least because the Turkish oud is usually (and partly) tuned one whole step higher than the Arabian. Turkish ouds tend to be more lightly constructed than Arabian with an unfinished sound board, lower string action and with string courses placed closer together. Turkish ouds also tend to be higher pitched and have a &quot;brighter timbre&quot;. Arabian ouds have a scale length of between 61 cm and 62 cm in comparison to the 58.5 cm scale length for Turkish. There exists also a variety of electro-acoustic and electric ouds.

The modern Persian barbat resembles the oud, although differences include a smaller body, longer neck, a slightly raised fingerboard, and a sound that is distinct from that of the oud. See more information at the page: Barbat (lute).

The cümbüş is a Turkish instrument that started as a hybrid of the oud and the banjo.

=== Tuning ===

Different ways of tuning the oud exist within the different oud traditions. Among those playing the oud in the Arabic tradition, a common older pattern of tuning the strings is (low pitch to high): D2 G2 A2 D3 G3 C4 on single string courses or D2, G2 G2, A2 A2, D3 D3, G3 G3, C4 C4 for a course of two strings. In the Turkish tradition, the &quot;Bolahenk&quot; tuning, is common, (low pitch to high): C#2 F#2 B2 E3 A3 D4 on instruments with single string courses or C#2, F#2 F#2, B2 B2, E3 E3, A3 A3, D4 D4 on instruments with courses of two strings. The C2 and F2 are actually tuned 1/4 of a tone higher than a normal c or f in the Bolahenk system.
Many current Arab players use this tuning: C2 F2 A2 D3 G3 C4 on the standard tuning instruments, and some use a higher pitch tuning, F2 A2 D3 G3 C4 F4

===Zenne oud===

The Zenne oud, often translated as a &quot;women&#x27;s oud&quot; or &quot;female oud&quot; is a smaller version of the oud designed for those with smaller hands and fingers. It usually has a scale length of 55–57 cm, instead of the 60–62 cm of the Arabic oud, and the 58.5 cm of the Turkish oud.

===Oud arbi and oud ramal===

The oud &quot;arbi&quot; is a North African variant of the oud with a longer neck and only four courses. It is not to be confused with the differently shaped and tuned kwitra. The oud arbi is tuned in a re-entrant tuning of G3 G3, E4 E4, A3 A3, D4 D4.

===Oud kumethra===
The &quot;oud kumethra&quot;, also known as &quot;pregnant oud&quot; or &quot;pear oud&quot; is an oud with the body in a pear-like shape. This type is relatively uncommon and mostly from Egypt.

===Electric oud===
A more experimental version is the oud counterpart to the electric guitar, used by the Franco-Algerian Folktronica band Speed Caravan.

<doc id="92166" wikidata="Q408641" url="?curid=92166" title="Citrulline">
<text>The organic compound citrulline is an α-amino acid. Its name is derived from &quot;citrullus&quot;, the Latin word for watermelon. Although named and described by gastroenterologists since the late 19th century, it was first isolated from watermelon in 1914 by Japanese researchers Yatarō Koga (古賀彌太郎) and Ryō Ōtake (大嶽了) and further codified by Mitsunori Wada of Tokyo Imperial University in 1930.
It has the formula H2NC(O)NH(CH2)3CH(NH2)CO2H. It is a key intermediate in the urea cycle, the pathway by which mammals excrete ammonia by converting it into urea. Citrulline is also produced as a byproduct of the enzymatic production of nitric oxide from the amino acid arginine, catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase.

==Biosynthesis==
Citrulline can be derived from:
* from arginine via nitric oxide synthase, as a byproduct of the production of nitric oxide for signaling purposes
* from ornithine through the breakdown of proline or glutamine/glutamate
* from asymmetric dimethylarginine via DDAH

Citrulline is made from ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate in one of the central reactions in the urea cycle. It is also produced from arginine as a byproduct of the reaction catalyzed by NOS family (NOS; EC 1.14.13.39). It is also prevalent in trichohyalin at the inner root sheath and medulla of hair follicles, where it is synthesized from arginine. Arginine is first oxidized into &quot;N&quot;-hydroxyl-arginine, which is then further oxidized to citrulline concomitant with release of nitric oxide.

Citrulline is also made by enterocytes of the small intestine.

==Function==
Citrulline is a metabolic intermediate within the urea cycle, which is the pathway by which mammals excrete ammonia by converting it into urea. Citrulline is also produced as a byproduct of the enzymatic production of nitric oxide from the amino acid arginine, catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase. In the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, citrulline is a metabolic intermediate in the latter, cytosolic half of the arginine biosynthesis pathway.

Several proteins contain citrulline as a result of a post-translational modification. These citrulline residues are generated by a family of enzymes called peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs), which convert arginine into citrulline in a process called citrullination or deimination with the help of calcium ions. Proteins that normally contain citrulline residues include myelin basic protein (MBP), filaggrin, and several histone proteins, whereas other proteins, such as fibrin and vimentin are susceptible to citrullination during cell death and tissue inflammation.

Circulating citrulline concentration is a biomarker of intestinal functionality.

==Commercial use==
L-citrulline is sold as a dietary supplement, usually in powder form. Advocates suggest that since L-citrulline boosts nitric oxide production, helping arterial function and thus blood flow throughout the body, this might be helpful in treating or preventing various ailments. 
*Lowering blood pressure in people with elevated blood pressure. 
*Easing symptoms of mild-to-moderate erectile dysfunction, with fewer risks than Viagra.
*Ameliorating circulatory problems such as slow wound healing due to diabetes.
*Raising muscle protein levels, preventing malnourishment in the elderly and possibly improving athletic performance.
*Treating intestinal problems, including short bowel syndrome, celiac disease and radiation-caused small bowel damage
*Various genetic disorders and health conditions such as liver disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease and certain dementias.

These assertions are based on animal studies, and like most dietary supplement claims have not be endorsed by the Food and Drugs Administration.

L-citrulline is added to certain energy drinks such as Reign and touted for its thermogenic effects.

<text>Union County is a county located in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 62,784. Its county seat is Marysville. Its name is reflective of its origins, being the union of portions of Franklin, Delaware, Madison, and Logan counties. Union County is part of the Columbus, Ohio Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
===Early history===
Union County has been under the rule of three countries in its history: France, England, and the present-day United States. It was discovered by the French explorer La Salle, along with traders and missionaries who accompanied him. After the French and Indian War, the Treaty of Paris of 1763 placed the area under British rule. Following the American Revolution, in 1783, the area would eventually become known as the Northwest Territory and part of the United States.
After the American Revolution, former soldiers from New England poured into Ohio after being granted land by the government. They surveyed the land, and sought to develop a state between Lake Erie and the Ohio River. Their proposals for the governance of the territory led to the passage of the Ordinance of 1787, which guided the establishment of states within the Northwestern Territory. Bitter struggles with American Indians over the next decades would follow, culminating with the battle of Tippecanoe in 1811, which saw the final defeat of the American Indian tribes in Ohio led by Tecumseh. A notable victim of the warring between the settlers and Indians was Jonathan Alder, who resided in and around the Union County area throughout his life.

===Original settlements===
The first town laid out in the county was North Liberty, established by Lucas Sullivant in 1797, but the first settlement in the county was made in present-day Jerome township by Joshua and James Ewing in 1798. An important settlement made in the county was by Abraham Amrine, of Swiss descent and a revolutionary soldier, in 1817, northwest of Marysville.

===Formation===
As part of negotiations with Virginia, who had claimed land in Ohio, to sign the Articles of Confederation, the United States granted them claims to land in Ohio which became known as the Virginia Military District. Union County was in this district. In 1803, Ohio became an independent state.

After lobbying by Col. James Curry, who represented the area in legislature at the time and a resident of what would become Jerome township, Union County was established by the Ohio legislature, and became official in 1820 with the appointment of the original commissioners: Stephen Bell, Reuben Wallace, and John Huston. The county commissioners eventually established the townships, including Union (1820), Darby (1820), Mill Creek (1820), Jerome (1821), Paris (1821), Liberty (1822), Leesburg (1825), Allen (1827), Jackson (1829), York (1834), Washington (1836), Dover (1839), Claibourne (1834), and Taylor (1849), while they designated Marysville as the county seat.

The town of Milford Center was established in 1816 by George Reed, Marysville in 1819 by Samuel Culbertson, Richwood in 1832 by Philip Plumber, Kingsville in 1834, Somerville in 1835, Watkins and Arbelia in 1838, Newton in 1838 by David Paul, York Center in 1841, Frankfort in 1846, Unionville in 1847, Pharisburg in 1847, New California in 1853, Dover in 1854, Union Center in 1863, Broadway in 1865, Pottersburg in 1869, Peoria in 1870, Magnetic Springs in 1879, and Claibourne in 1881.

====County seat====

After the organization of the county by the Ohio Legislature, Marysville was designated as the seat of Union County. The first recorded meeting of the commissioners was in 1820. Between 1835 and 1840, a courthouse was constructed. Eventually, a new courthouse would be built in Marysville, dedicated on January 27, 1883. This is the present courthouse today.

In 1849, a county infirmary was authorized. The first county jail was a log structure that sat on the southside of East Center street, in the rear of the courthouse. Eventually, a new jail was authorized by the commissioners and built in the 1870s. In 1878, the county purchased a 10-ton safe for the treasury, that eventually was moved into courthouse.

The first county fair was held in 1847 in Marysville, in the public square. In 1852, the Agriculture Society moved the fair to the current location, on the northside of town.

In 1866, the Union County Teachers&#x27; Institute was organized in Marysville, with Franklin Wood serving at the first President. In 1882, the Normal School was organized by J.S. Wharton, which specialized in instructing future teachers.
===Early growth===
====Infrastructure====
The county lacked transportation infrastructure until 1812, when the first known highway named Post Road was constructed across the southern portion of the county. In 1844, the legislature by act created a free turnpike that ran from Columbus to Bellefontaine, passing through Marysville, originally costing $230,000. This road eventually became what is known as U.S. Route 33 today. In 1853, the Marysville and Essex Plank Road Company was organized and constructed a road from Marysville north, through Pharisburg. The company sold capital stock for $30,000, and this road today is known as State Rt. 4. By 1915, the county had built of roadways, the most of any county in the state for its size.

By the late 19th century and into the 20th century, the county began developing its electricity infrastructure. By 1915, electricity lines ran from Magnetic Springs to Richwood.

The county&#x27;s first railroad was constructed between 1850 and 1854, a line that ran from Springfield to Delaware and crossed through the county in Milford Center, Marysville, Irwin, and Dover. A railroad called the New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio line was chartered in 1851 and would eventually run through Union County with station points at Richwood, Woodland, Claibourne, Pottersburg, Broadway, and Peoria. The Columbus and Bellefontaine railroad was incorporated in 1878 and had station points in the county at Marysville. The Toledo and Central railroad ran from Columbus north through the county, with station points at Marysville, Peoria, and Raymond.

The first telegraph line was completed in 1859, which connected Marysville with the world via Springfield.

====Agriculture====

Because of the fertile soil in Union County, the county&#x27;s farmers required minimal fertilizer. There were hundreds of farms in the county in its early stages. The crops grown in Union County&#x27;s early history included wheat, oats, corn, Irish potatoes, clover and alfalfa. The county was a large producer of milk, butter, sugar, syrup, apples, and pears.

In 1911, were owned in Union County, with 85,000 cultivated for farming. The farms had a total of 9,355 horses, 8,110 milk cows with 14,000 total cattle, 43,727 sheep, and 32,000 hogs. of wool was produced that year.

====Commerce and industry====

Union County was home to many industries in its original days from hotels, tanneries, distilleries, breweries, mills, asheries, manufacturers, energy production, banks, grocers, and retailers, among others.
Marysville&#x27;s industrial roots can be traced back to many early companies. Among those were the Marysville Pearlash Factory, an ashery founded in 1848, which by 1874 was the largest in the United States. The first steam-grist mill was erected in 1856 by Saxton and Casil. In 1867, Miller &amp; Snodgrass constructed a flour mill. In 1874, Marysville Butter Tub and Spoke Company was incorporated with $50,000.

A wool company, Woodbury &amp; Welsh, constructed a brick factory on the northeast part of town in 1864, and a brewery was built in 1866 on the eastside. In 1868, O.M. Scotts and Company was organized. In 1871, the Marysville Cheese Manufacturing Company was built on the eastside. Many carriage manufacturing companies were placed in Marysville, including Bauer, Schepper &amp; Devine in 1882, City Carriage Works in 1871, and L. E. Helium in 1874.

In 1875, Rice, Fleck &amp; Co. opened a lumberyard. The Marysville Gas Light Company was incorporated in 1878 following almost a decade of the city using gasoline for lighting.

Richwood was home to hotels such as the Parsons House and Beem House. Large mills in Richwood included Beem and Biddle, Loveless, Howe, and Bishop, and S. M. and A. J. Blake. There were large tile manufacturers, and a plethora of commercial and industrial interests including jewelers, furniture retailers, and lumber yards.

Milford Center was home to mills, distilleries, tanneries, and companies such as the Milford Center Lumber and Supply Company, Ohio Elevator and Grain Company, Robinson and Richter Company, and Childs and Cover, a carriage manufacturer.
Magnetic Springs, following the discovery of natural healing waters, became a tourist haven in the late 19th century until the innovation of modern medicine in the early 20th century. Tourists from all over the world visited the springs and stayed at resorts such as &quot;The Park&quot; and &quot;The Columbus&quot;. &quot;The Park&quot; was home to the &quot;Sager Sanitarium Bath&quot;.

====Legal====
Union County was home to many notable jurists in its early history, including John F. Kinney, who practiced in Union County in 1836 and eventually became a supreme court justice in Iowa and later a congressman from Utah. Edward Stillings grew up near Milford Center and was a graduate of Harvard, and became one of the top jurists in the country, practicing before the United States Supreme Court and helping to form the legal code of Kansas in the 1870s. James Wallace Robinson was a native of Union County and went on to become a U.S. congressman in 1872. James E. Robinson, a native of Union County, would eventually become an Ohio Supreme Court justice.

Cole, attended Harvard, practiced law with his father in 1867, and after being elected to the legislature in Indiana, became Deputy United States Assessor for Internal Revenue. Joseph Kennedy was admitted to the bar in 1871, and would become mayor of Marysville. Charles W. Fairbanks was admitted to the bar in 1874 and went on to become a United States Vice President.

====Media====

Publishing exerted great influence over public opinion in the county in its early days. Monthly and weekly publishings were the earliest known forms of the media in the county originally. The earliest known newspaper in the county was the &quot;Our Freedom and Union County Advertiser&quot;, first published in Marysville in 1839 by Stephen McClain, Robert McBrattney, and William Lawrence. The newspaper was then renamed the &quot;Union Star&quot; after a year and continued until May 1841, when it was purchased by John Cassil and renamed the &quot;Union Gazette&quot;. In 1842, the paper moved to Bellefontaine and was edited by Thomas Robb, with the paper sent weekly to Marysville. In 1843, the paper moved back to Marysville and was published until 1844. During the period it was owned by Cassil, it politically leaned Democratic.

In 1844, the paper was purchased by P.B. Cole and W.C. Lawrence, who renamed it the &quot;Argus and Union County Advertiser&quot;, and moved the politics toward the Whig party. In 1845, the paper was sold to James Alexander, and after only six weeks, sold back to John Cassil, who turned the paper back into a Democrat political newspaper. In 1846, P.B. Cole bought the newspaper back and turned it back into a Whig political newspaper. In 1849, he sold the paper to C.S. Hamilton, who renamed it the &quot;Marysville Tribune&quot;. A notable printer of the Marysville Tribune was Preston Plumb, who eventually left Marysville and became a U.S. Senator in Kansas. The paper would eventually be purchased by the Shearer family, who published daily editions that were Republican-leaning, and weekly editions that were independent.

Other papers in the county were the &quot;Eaglet&quot;, formed in 1845, and lasting only a few months. The &quot;Union Journal&quot;, formed in 1853, lasted a year. It would be moved to Xenia, where it became the &quot;Xenia News&quot;, and edited by Whitelaw Reid. The &quot;Union Press&quot; was formed in 1858 by Hylas Sabine and was Republican-leaning. In 1863, it was purchased by the Vallandighamer family and changed to the &quot;Union Democrat&quot;, which changed the paper in politics and spent its time attacking the Union government during the American Civil War. It ceased operations in 1864. In 1883, the &quot;Darby News&quot; was formed in Milford Center and eventually became the &quot;Milford Echo&quot; before folding. Also, were the &quot;Milford Ohioan&quot; was formed in 1887, the &quot;Richwood Gazette&quot; in 1872, the &quot;Richwood Reporter&quot; in 1882, which ceased operations two years later when destroyed by fire, and the &quot;Octograph Review&quot;.

In 1874, the &quot;Marysville Journal&quot; was formed by C.M. Kenton, later becoming the &quot;Union County Journal&quot;, and leaned Democratic. By 1883, the &quot;Marysville Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Union County Journal&quot; were the only newspapers published in the county. Bruce Gaumer purchased the &quot;Union County Journal&quot; in 1904, and later bought the &quot;Marysville Tribune&quot; in 1951. In 1952, Gaumer merged the two newspapers into what is known today as the &quot;Marysville Journal-Tribune&quot;.

====Banking====
The pioneers who composed the large majority of county residents in the early 19th century were generally very poor, meaning that there was no need for a bank in the county&#x27;s early years. Trade was done by barter, including the exchange of coon and deer skins, whiskey, honey, and other durable goods. The state bank issued currency in the early periods known as &quot;red dogs&quot;, &quot;wildcats&quot;, and other currencies which passed through the county, with a bank note reporter published weekly to inform consumers of exchange rates of these currencies. Gold and silver was of little value in the early days, and what banks were formed usually failed.

After some banking laws were passed and the production of the county grew, currency gained value in trade, including paper, gold, and silver, and banks were permanently established in the county. The first bank in the county was the Bank of Marysville, established by Andrews, Evans, and Woods in 1854.

===Modern development===
Memorial Hospital of Union County was constructed in Marysville in 1952. Many other developments would take place during this time, including the construction of the Union County Airport in Marysville, as well as numerous manufacturing companies and small housing developments throughout the county. U.S. Route 33 was expanded from a two-lane highway to a four-lane highway in the 1980s.

===Military heritage===

Union County has a military heritage dating back to the American Revolution, and was a frequent location for the organization of military companies. Because the government paid the soldiers with land grants in the west during the revolution, Union County became home to many of these soldiers after the war. A recorded 14 soldiers from the revolution eventually made their way to Union County, with many others unrecorded because of poor record keeping.

The War of 1812 broke out with early battles fought in the Northwest Territory, including Lake Erie. A descendant of a hero, Oliver Hazard Perry, from the War of 1812, named Robert S. Beightler, was a native of Union County. A company of 13 Union County men was assembled for this war, with many other natives of Union County joining companies from outside the county, including a company formed by Jonathan Alder. Over 100 natives of the county would serve in the war.

When the Mexican War broke in 1845 following the annexation of Texas into the United States, Union County provided men, totalling over 30.

The American Civil War followed, which was not greeted in the same manner the previous war was. However, Union County would provide 3,200 men for that war, while producing notable leaders such as Norton P. Chipman.

In 2007, the Union County Veterans Remembrance Committee dedicated the Union County Veterans Memorial on the northeast lawn of the courthouse. This was sponsored through private, public, and corporate grants and donations, including support from the Union County Foundation. In 2008, the Ohio National Guard opened a new $8.2 million Marysville facility.

He has been chairman of the Union County Board of Elections, and is an inductee into the Ohio Agricultural Hall of Fame.

There is a Union County Farmer&#x27;s Market, and the Ohio State University operates an agricultural extension office in the central portion of the county.

===Industrial===

In 2007, the estimated value of manufacturing operations in the county was well over $3.5 billion.

It is the home to major corporations, including Scotts Miracle-Gro and Univenture. Major corporations operating regional facilities in the county include Honda of America, Goodyear/Veyance Technologies, Parker Hannifin, United Rotary Brush, and Invensys Climate Control. The Honda operation includes the Marysville Auto Plant. Other large companies located in the county include Sumitomo Electric Wiring Systems, Ray Lewis and Son, Velocys, MAI Manufacturing, NEX Transport, and Midwest Express, among others.
Between 2000 and 2007, Union County businesses were awarded $9.3 million in United States Department of Defense contracts. The companies receiving those contracts were the Electronic Services Agency, Parker Hannifin, United Rotary Brush, and Leo Berbee Bulb Company.

===Research and development===
Union County is home to major research and development operations. Nestlé is located in Marysville, and in recent years improved their facilities with a modern, multimillion-dollar makeover. Scotts Miracle-Gro also has their R&amp;D operations located on their corporate campus. The Transportation Research Center is located on the western county line. A unit of Univenture, Algae Venture Systems, recently made a breakthrough by developing a process to produce algae as a cost-effective biofuel.
==Government==


The county receives its power through Ohio statute. It has three elected commissioners that serve four years, as well as an elected treasurer, auditor, recorder, coroner, clerk of courts, engineer, prosecuting attorney, sheriff, and judges. In 2007, the county had $112 million in assets, and revenues of $50 million.

The county is a part of the 4th U.S. congressional district in Ohio, the 86th Ohio legislative district in Ohio, and the 26th Ohio senate district.

==Politics==
Union County is a Republican Party stronghold. Its strong Republican roots go back to the formation of the party in the 1800s following the collapse of the Whig Party, which had previously been the preferred party.

The county has supported the Republican Party in all but two presidential elections since the Civil War, with the only Democrats to win the county being Woodrow Wilson in 1912 when the Republican Party was divided, and Franklin Roosevelt in 1932. In the last twenty-one presidential elections, the Democratic candidate has only once — in Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 landslide when he won all but five counties in Ohio — received more than 37 percent of the county&#x27;s vote.

As part of Ohio&#x27;s 5th congressional district and Ohio&#x27;s 15th congressional district it had been represented by Republicans for almost seventy years until the 2008 election, when Democrat Mary Jo Kilroy, won a close, disputed contest against Steve Stivers.
In 2010, Stivers defeated her in a rematch, and after reapportionment and redistricting, the county was placed in the heavily Republican 4th district, currently represented by Jim Jordan.

The entire county is contained in the 26th Ohio Senate district and is currently represented by Dave Burke, who previously served on Marysville City Council and as the state Representative for the 83rd Ohio House district.

The entire county is contained in the 86th Ohio House district, currently represented by Tracy Richardson elected in 2018.

<text>Tuscarawas County ( ) is a county located in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 93,263. Its county seat is New Philadelphia. Its name is a Delaware Indian word variously translated as &quot;old town&quot; or &quot;open mouth&quot;. Tuscarawas County comprises the New Philadelphia–Dover, OH Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Cleveland–Akron–Canton, OH Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
For years, European-American colonists on the East Coast did not know much about the territory west of the Appalachian Mountains except for reports from a few explorers and fur traders who ventured into the area. In 1750, Christopher Gist of the Ohio Land Company explored the Tuscarawas Valley. His report of the area hinted at some natural riches and friendly American Indians.

In 1761 Moravian missionaries set out from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, to set up a mission in the Tuscarawas Valley. Christian Frederick Post, David Zeisberger, and John Heckewelder met with Chief Netawatwees of the western Delaware Indians, also known as the &quot;Lenape&quot;. He invited them to the tribal village he had founded, Gekelemukpechunk (present-day Newcomerstown, Ohio). He granted the missionaries permission to build a cabin near the junction of the Sandy Creek and Tuscarawas River, in present-day Stark County and begin evangelizing the natives. While they were successful in baptizing dozens of converts, they were forced to abandon the mission in 1763 during the French and Indian War (part of the Seven Years&#x27; War).

Again, at the request of Chief Netawatwees in 1771, David Zeisberger returned to found additional missions in the Tuscarawas Valley. In the spring of 1772, near the present site of New Philadelphia, Ohio, Zeisberger, along with five converted Indian families established the mission of Schoenbrunn (beautiful spring), also known as Welhik Tuppeek (best spring). They built a school house and a chapel. In August of that year, John Heckawelder brought an additional 250 converted Christian Delawares into the village.

In late summer 1772, they established a second settlement, roughly 10 miles away from Schoenbrunn, called Gnadenhütten (cabins of grace). On October 17, 1772, Zeisberger conducted the first religious service at Gnadenhutten. In 1776, Chief Netawatwes donated land for another settlement, Lichtenau (meadow of light), near present-day Coshocton, then the principal Delaware village in the region.

The American Revolutionary War brought the demise of these first settlements. The Delawares, who at the time populated much of eastern Ohio, were divided over their loyalties, with many in the west allied with the British out of Fort Detroit and many in the east allied with the Americans out of Fort Pitt. Delawares were involved in skirmishes against both sides, but by 1781 the American sense was that the Delawares were allying with the British. In response, Colonel Daniel Brodhead of the American forces led an expedition out of Fort Pitt and on April 19, 1781, destroyed the settlement of Coshocton. Surviving residents fled to the north. Colonel Brodhead&#x27;s forces left the Delawares at the other Moravian mission villages unmolested, but the actions set the stage for raised tensions in the area.

In September 1781, British forces and Indian allies, primarily Wyandot and Delaware, forced the Christian Indians and missionaries from the remaining Moravian villages. The Indian allies took their prisoners further west toward Lake Erie to a new village, called Captive Town, on the Sandusky River. The British took the missionaries David Zeisberger and John Heckewelder under guard back to Fort Detroit, where the two men were tried (but eventually acquitted) on charges of treason against the British Crown.

The Indians at Captive Town were going hungry because of insufficient rations, and in February 1782, more than 100 returned to their old Moravian villages to harvest the crops and collect the stored food they had been forced to leave behind. In early March 1782, 160 Pennsylvania militia led by Lieutenant Colonel David Williamson raided the villages and garrisoned the Indians in the village of Gnadenhütten, accusing them of taking part in raids into Pennsylvania. Although the Delawares rejected the charges as they were pacifist Christians, the militia held a council and voted to kill them. The next morning on March 8, the militia tied up the Indians, stunned them with mallet blows to the head, and killed them with fatal scalping cuts. In all, the militia murdered and scalped 28 men, 29 women, and 39 children. They piled the bodies of the Moravian Christian Lenape and Moravian Christian Mahicans in the mission buildings and burned the village down. They also burned the other abandoned Moravian villages in the area.

This action, which came to be known as the Gnadenhutten massacre, caused an outright frontier war to break out between the Delawares and the Americans. After several years of ongoing campaigns by the natives to terrorize and keep out further American settlers, a brutal campaign by US General &quot;Mad Anthony&quot; Wayne from Fort Washington (now Cincinnati) was carried out in late 1793, eventually resulting in the Treaty of Greenville being signed in 1795 between the US government and the local natives. The Treaty ceded the eastern ⅔ of current-day Ohio to white settlers and once again opened up the territory for white settlement.

In October 1798, David Zeisberger, the same Moravian missionary who had founded many of the original missions in the 1770s, returned to the Tuscarawas Valley to found a new mission, Goshen, from where he continued his work to evangelize the local natives with the Christian gospel. Over the next several years, farmer settlers from Pennsylvania came trickling into the area, and by 1808, the first permanent settlement, New Philadelphia, was founded near the Goshen mission. After the War of 1812, Goshen declined as a mission until it was disbanded in 1824.

Tuscarawas County was formed from Muskingum County on February 15, 1808.

In the late 1820s, Tuscarawas County was chosen to be on the route of the Ohio and Erie Canal, a man-made waterway linking Lake Erie (via Cleveland) to the Ohio River (via Portsmouth, Ohio). Construction from Massillon, Ohio to Canal Dover, Ohio was completed in 1829. Construction from Canal Dover, Ohio to Newark, Ohio was completed in 1830. A total of 15 locks were built in Tuscarawas County, entering the county line on an aqueduct north of Zoar, Ohio on Lock 7 to Newcomerstown, Ohio, exiting the county below Lock 21. In 1848, the feeder Sandy and Beaver Canal was completed, linking Bolivar, Ohio to the Ohio River at Glasgow, Pennsylvania. With the rise of railroads, and a massive flood in 1913, the canal system was abandoned. Three years later, the city of Canal Dover shortened its name Dover to 1916.

<text>Trumbull County is a county in the far northeast portion of the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 201,977. Its county seat and largest city is Warren, which developed industry along the Mahoning River. Trumbull County is part of the Youngstown–Warren, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
In the early years of the European discovery and exploration of the New World, the land that became Trumbull County was originally claimed by French explorers as part of the French colony of Canada (New France). Their settlements had some fur traders who interacted with Native American tribes in this area. After losing the Seven Years&#x27; War to Great Britain, France was forced to cede its territories east of the Mississippi River in 1763. Great Britain renamed New France as the Province of Quebec.

Following the United States&#x27; victory in its Revolutionary War, the British were forced to cede this land to the new nation. The federal government convinced Connecticut to give up its claim to the land, but it was known as part of the Connecticut Western Reserve in the Northwest Territory. Connecticut retained sovereignty over some of the eastern portion of what became Ohio, selling this area in 1795 to the Connecticut Land Company, a speculative private development firm. As first organized, Trumbull County consisted of the entire area of the Connecticut Western Reserve before population increased, and it was divided into smaller counties. The county&#x27;s main city, Warren, was originally founded as the capitol of the Western Reserve territory. 

No Native American settlements have ever formally been identified in Trumbull County; however, artifacts are uncovered often. Early settlers did believe they noted an ancient village site in Kinsman, a more contemporary site in Hartford, and several strange stone constructions were noted in the Black Ash Swamp by early Bristol residents- this area now known as the Grand River Preserve. Many presumably different groups of Natives were still frequenting camps in the vicinity of Newton Falls and somewhere near the Champion-Warren township border when modern Americans first began to settle there. Several of the names of specific Native persons are echoed across most of these early residents&#x27; histories- namely Cadashaway, Paqua and Kiogg. A memorial stone piles believed to have been Native in origin was situated on the West Bank of the Mahoning, but was later removed for construction purposes. Before 1600, the area was ambiguously between the territories of the Erie people to the east and the Whittlesey Culture to the west. It is currently unknown precisely where one tribe&#x27;s territory ended and the other began. After the Beaver Wars, the area was frequented by travelling Lenape, Wyandot, Ottawa, Shawnee and Seneca, who all had settlements nearby for a time and shared the valley&#x27;s animal, food and medicinal resources. They also regularly panned for salt in the marshes. The Natives collectively used this area as a shared hunting ground, but had to give up ownership of the region for settlement as punishment for participating in the Northwest Indian War. However, early residents say Natives still frequented the area until roughly 1811. Some of the final Native residents were camped along the Grand River in Mespotamia during the war, leading to an upsetting altercation in which the locals found and ransacked their camp and, as a warning to leave, carved an image of a Native man into a tree and shot it. The Natives responded by carving a white man into a tree without a mark on it, but seem to have later felt it was unsafe to stay and left. They could have gone south to Prophetstown, a religious compound run by Tecumseh&#x27;s brother, and got caught up in the Shawnee War and War of 1812, or they and several other Native communities scattered around northeast Ohio may have condensed into a handful of settlements in the Cuyahoga River, before the majority of them relocated west in 1813 to either live with the main Ottawa or Wyandot tribe. Only a handful of Native individuals were left throughout all of Northeast Ohio and historically recorded following this. 

The county is named for Jonathan Trumbull, Governor of Connecticut, who once owned the land in this region. Early settlements were made along the Mahoning River and other waterways, which provided transportation access and water power to the industries that developed later in the 19th century.

<text>A webcam is a video camera which is designed to record or stream to a computer or computer network. They are primarily used in video telephony, live streaming and social media, and security. Webcams can be built-in computer hardware or peripheral devices, and are commonly connected to a device using USB or wireless protocol. 

Webcams have been used on the Internet as early as 1993, and the first widespread commercial one became available in 1994. Early webcam usage on the Internet was primarily limited to stationary shots streamed to web sites. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, instant messaging clients added support for webcams, increasing their popularity in video conferencing. Computer manufacturers later started integrating webcams into laptop hardware. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a shortage of webcams due to the increased number of people working from home.

== History ==

=== Early development (early 1990s) ===
First developed in 1991, a webcam was pointed at the Trojan Room coffee pot in the Cambridge University Computer Science Department (initially operating over a local network instead of the web). The camera was finally switched off on August 22, 2001. The final image captured by the camera can still be viewed at its homepage. The oldest continuously operating webcam, San Francisco State University&#x27;s FogCam, has run since 1994 and is still operating It updates every 20 seconds.

The SGI Indy, released in 1993, is the first commercial computer to have a standard video camera, and the first SGI computer to have standard video inputs.

The maximum supported input resolution is 640×480 for NTSC or 768×576 for PAL. A fast machine is required to capture at either of these resolutions, though; an Indy with slower R4600PC CPU, for example, may require the input resolution to be reduced before storage or processing. However, the Vino hardware is capable of DMAing video fields directly into the frame buffer with minimal CPU overhead.

The first widespread commercial webcam, the black-and-white QuickCam, entered the marketplace in 1994, created by the U.S. computer company Connectix. QuickCam was available in August 1994 for the Apple Macintosh, connecting via a serial port, at a cost of $100. Jon Garber, the designer of the device, had wanted to call it the &quot;Mac-camera&quot;, but was overruled by Connectix&#x27;s marketing department; a version with a PC-compatible parallel port and software for Microsoft Windows was launched in October 1995. The original Quick Cam provided 320x240-pixel resolution with a grayscale depth of 16 shades at 60 frames per second, or 256 shades at 15 frames per second. These cam were tested on several Delta II launch using a variety of communication protocols including CDMA, TDMA, GSM and HF.

Videoconferencing via computers already existed, and at the time client-server based videoconferencing software such as CU-SeeMe had started to become popular.

The first widely known laptop with integrated webcam option, at a pricepoint starting at US$ 12,000, was an IBM RS/6000 860 laptop and its related ThinkPad 850, released in 1996.

=== Entering the mainstream (late 1990s)===

One of the most widely reported-on webcam sites was JenniCam, created in 1996, which allowed Internet users to observe the life of its namesake constantly, in the same vein as the reality TV series &quot;Big Brother&quot;, launched four years later. Other cameras are mounted overlooking bridges, public squares, and other public places, their output made available on a public web page in accordance with the original concept of a &quot;webcam&quot;. Aggregator websites have also been created, providing thousands of live video streams or up-to-date still pictures, allowing users to find live video streams based on location or other criteria.

In the late 1990s, Microsoft NetMeeting was the only videoconferencing software on PC in widespread use, making use of webcams. In the following years, instant messaging clients started adding webcam support: Yahoo Messenger introduced this with version 5.5 in 2002, allowing video calling in 20 frames per second using a webcam. MSN Messenger gained this in version 5.0 in 2003.

=== 2000s–2019 ===
Around the turn of the 21st century, computer hardware manufacturers began building webcams directly into laptop and desktop screens, thus eliminating the need to use an external USB or FireWire camera. Gradually webcams came to be used more for telecommunications, or videotelephony, between two people, or among several people, than for offering a view on a Web page to an unknown public.

For less than US$100 in 2012, a three-dimensional space webcam became available, producing videos and photos in 3D anaglyph image with a resolution up to 1280 × 480 pixels. Viewers must use 3D glasses to see the effect of three dimensional image.

=== 2020–present ===

With remote work entering the mainstream, the built-in cameras of average laptops were sometimes considered inadequate. Consequently,
during the COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage of external webcams in retail occurred. Most laptops before and during the pandemic were made with cameras capping out at 720p recording quality at best, compared to the industry standard of 1080p or 4K seen in smartphones and televisions from the same period. The backlog on new developments for built-in webcams is the result of a design flaw with laptops being too thin to support the 7mm camera modules to fit inside, instead resorting to ~2.5mm. Also the camera components are more expensive and not a high level of demand for this feature, Smartphones started to be used as a backup option or webcam replacement, with kits including lighting and tripods or downloadable apps.

Image sensors can be CMOS or CCD, the former being dominant for low-cost cameras, but CCD cameras do not necessarily outperform CMOS-based cameras in the low-price range. Most consumer webcams are capable of providing VGA-resolution video at a frame rate of 30 frames per second. Many newer devices can produce video in multi-megapixel resolutions, and a few can run at high frame rates such as the PlayStation Eye, which can produce 320×240 video at 120 frames per second. Most image sensors are sourced from Omnivision or Sony.

As webcams evolved simultaneously with display technologies, USB interface speeds and broadband internet speeds, the resolution went up from gradually from 320×240, to 640×480, and some now even offer 1280×720 (aka 720p) or 1920×1080 (aka 1080p) resolution. Despite the low cost, the resolution offered as of 2019 is impressive, with now the low-end webcams offering resolutions of 720p, mid-range webcams offering 1080p resolution, and high-end webcams offering 4K resolution at 60 fps.

=== Optics ===

Various lenses are available, the most common in consumer-grade webcams being a plastic lens that can be manually moved in and out to focus the camera. Fixed-focus lenses, which have no provision for adjustment, are also available. As a camera system&#x27;s depth of field is greater for small image formats and is greater for lenses with a large f-number (small aperture), the systems used in webcams have a sufficiently large depth of field that the use of a fixed-focus lens does not impact image sharpness to a great extent.

Most models use simple, focal-free optics (fixed focus, factory-set for the usual distance from the monitor to which it is fastened to the user) or manual focus.

Webcams can come with different presets and fields of view. Individual users can make use of less than 90° horizontal FOV for home offices and live streaming. Webcams with as much as 360° horizontal FOV can be used for small- to medium-sized rooms (sometimes even large rooms). Depending on the users&#x27; purposes, webcams in the market can display the whole room or just the general vicinity.

=== Internal software ===
As the bayer filter is proprietary, any webcam contains some built-in image processing, separate from compression. Digital video streams are represented by huge amounts of data, burdening its transmission (from the image sensor, where the data is continuously created) and storage alike. Most if not all cheap webcams come with built-in ASIC to do video compression in real-time.

Support electronics read the image from the sensor and transmit it to the host computer. Most webcams come with a controller that translates video over USB from Sonix, Suyin, Ricoh, Realtek or others. Typically, each frame is transmitted uncompressed in RGB or YUV or compressed as JPEG. Some cameras, such as mobile-phone cameras, use a CMOS sensor with supporting electronics &quot;on die&quot;, i.e. the sensor and the support electronics are built on a single silicon chip to save space and manufacturing costs. Most webcams feature built-in microphones to make video calling and videoconferencing more convenient.

=== Interface and external software ===
Typical interfaces used by articles marketed as a &quot;webcam&quot; are USB, Ethernet and IEEE 802.11 (denominated as IP camera). Further interfaces such as e.g. Composite video, S-Video or FireWire were also available. The USB video device class (UVC) specification allows inter-connectivity of webcams to computers without the need for proprietary device drivers.

Various proprietary as well as free and open-source software is available to handle the UVC stream. One could use Guvcview or GStreamer and GStreamer-based software to handle the UVC stream. Another could use multiple USB cameras attached to the host computer the software resides on, and broadcast multiple streams at once over (Wireless) Ethernet, such as MotionEye. MotionEye can either be installed onto a Raspberry Pi as MotionEyeOs, or afterwards on Raspbian as well. MotionEye can also be set up on Debian, Raspbian is a variant of Debian. MotionEye V4.1.1 ( Aug &#x27;21 ) can only run on Debian 10 Buster ( oldstable ) and Python 2.7. Newer versions such as 3.X are not supported at this point of time according to Ccrisan, foundator and author of MotionEye.

Various software tools in wide use can be employed to take video and pictures, such as PicMaster and Microsoft&#x27;s Camera app (for use with Windows operating systems), Photo Booth (Mac), or Cheese (with Unix systems). For a more complete list see Comparison of webcam software.

== Uses ==
The most popular use of webcams is the establishment of video links, permitting computers to act as videophones or videoconference stations. For example, Apple&#x27;s iSight camera, which is built into Apple laptops, iMacs and a majority of iPhones, can be used for video chat sessions, using the Messages instant messaging program. Other popular uses include security surveillance, computer vision, video broadcasting, and for recording social videos.

=== Videotelephony ===
Webcams can be added to instant messaging, text chat services such as AOL Instant Messenger, and VoIP services such as Skype, one-to-one live video communication over the Internet has now reached millions of mainstream PC users worldwide. Improved video quality has helped webcams encroach on traditional video conferencing systems. New features such as automatic lighting controls, real-time enhancements (retouching, wrinkle smoothing and vertical stretch), automatic face tracking and autofocus, assist users by providing substantial ease-of-use, further increasing the popularity of webcams.

Webcams can also encourage remote work, enabling people to work remotely via the Internet. This usage was crucial to the survival of many businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, when in-person office work was discouraged. Businesses, schools, and individuals have relied on video conferencing instead of spending on business travel for meetings. Moreover, the number of video conferencing cameras and software have multiplied since then due to their popularity. 

Webcam features and performance can vary by program, computer operating system, and also by the computer&#x27;s processor capabilities. Video calling support has also been added to several popular instant messaging programs.

Webcams allow for inexpensive, real-time video chat and webcasting, in both amateur and professional pursuits. They are frequently used in online dating and for online personal services offered mainly by women when camgirling. However, the ease of webcam use through the Internet for video chat has also caused issues. For example, moderation system of various video chat websites such as Omegle has been criticized as being ineffective, with sexual content still rampant. In a 2013 case, the transmission of nude photos and videos via Omegle from a teenage girl to a schoolteacher resulted in a child pornography charge.

The popularity of webcams among teenagers with Internet access has raised concern about the use of webcams for cyber-bullying. Webcam recordings of teenagers, including underage teenagers, are frequently posted on popular Web forums and imageboards such as 4chan.

=== Monitoring ===

Webcams can be used as security cameras. Software is available to allow PC-connected cameras to watch for movement and sound, recording both when they are detected. These recordings can then be saved to the computer, e-mailed, or uploaded to the Internet. In one well-publicised case, a computer e-mailed images of the burglar during the theft of the computer, enabling the owner to give police a clear picture of the burglar&#x27;s face even after the computer had been stolen.

In December 2011, Russia announced that 290,000 Webcams would be installed in 90,000 polling stations to monitor the 2012 Russian presidential election. Webcams may be installed at places such as childcare centres, offices, shops and private areas to monitor security and general activity.

=== Astrophotography ===

With very-low-light capability, a few specific models of webcams are very popular to photograph the night sky by astronomers and astro photographers. Mostly, these are manual-focus cameras and contain an old CCD array instead of comparatively newer CMOS array. The lenses of the cameras are removed and then these are attached to telescopes to record images, video, still, or both. In newer techniques, videos of very faint objects are taken for a couple of seconds and then all the frames of the video are &quot;stacked&quot; together to obtain a still image of respectable contrast.

===Laser beam profiling===
A webcam&#x27;s CCD response is linearly proportional to the incoming light. Therefore, webcams are suitable to record laser beam profiles, after the lens is removed. The resolution of a laser beam profiler depends on the pixel size. Commercial webcams are usually designed to record color images. The size of a webcam&#x27;s color pixel depends on the model and may lie in the range of 5 to 10 μm. However, a color pixel consists of four black and white pixels each equipped with a color filter (for details see Bayer filter). Although these color filters work well in the visible, they may be rather transparent in the near infrared. By switching a webcam into the Bayer-mode it is possible to access the information of the single pixels and a resolution below 3 μm was possible.

== Privacy concerns ==

Many users do not wish the continuous exposure for which webcams were originally intended, but rather prefer privacy. Such privacy is lost when malware allow malicious hackers to activate the webcam without the user&#x27;s knowledge, providing the hackers with a live video and audio feed. This is a particular concern on many laptop computers, as such cameras normally cannot be physically disabled if hijacked by such a Trojan Horse program or other similar spyware programs.

Cameras such as Apple&#x27;s older external iSight cameras include lens covers to thwart this. Some webcams have built-in hardwired LED indicators that light up whenever the camera is active, sometimes only in video mode. However, it is possible, depending on the circuit design of a webcam, for malware to circumvent the indicator and activate the camera surreptitiously, as researchers demonstrated in the case of a MacBook&#x27;s built-in camera in 2013.

Various companies sell sliding lens covers and stickers that allow users to retrofit a computer or smartphone to close access to the camera lens as needed. One such company reported having sold more than 250,000 such items from 2013 to 2016. However, any opaque material will work just as well.

The process of attempting to hack into a person&#x27;s webcam and activate it without the webcam owner&#x27;s permission has been called camfecting, a portmanteau of &quot;cam&quot; and &quot;infecting&quot;. The remotely activated webcam can be used to watch anything within the webcam&#x27;s field of vision. Camfecting is most often carried out by infecting the victim&#x27;s computer with a computer virus.

<text>Ann Radcliffe (née Ward; 9 July 1764 – 7 February 1823) was an English novelist, a pioneer of Gothic fiction, and a minor poet. Her technique of explaining apparently supernatural elements in her novels has been credited with gaining respectability for Gothic fiction in the 1790s. Radcliffe was the most popular writer of her day and almost universally admired; contemporary critics called her the &quot;mighty enchantress&quot; and the Shakespeare of romance-writers, and her popularity continued through the 19th century. Interest in Radcliffe and her work has revived in the early 21st century, with the publication of three biographies.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Radcliffe was born Ann Ward in Holborn, London on 9 July 1764. She was the only child of William Ward (1737–1798) and Ann Oates (1726–1800). Biographies of Radcliffe typically emphasize her illustrious distant relatives over her close relatives, who were in trade, as part of cultivating a genteel and ladylike reputation for her. At the time of her birth, her father owned a haberdasher shop in London. Her mother came from a family of leadmakers and glaziers. Her father had a famous uncle, William Cheselden, who was Surgeon to King George II; her mother descended from the De Witt family of Holland and her cousins included Sir Richard Jebb, a fashionable London physician, and a Bishop, Samuel Hallifax.

In 1772, Radcliffe&#x27;s father moved to Bath to manage a shop owned by Thomas Bentley and Josiah Wedgwood, makers of Wedgwood porcelain. As Bentley and Wedgwood discussed in their correspondence, the shop was intended to sell second-rate goods to the less-discerning tourists of Bath. Radcliffe&#x27;s father also supplemented his income by renting rooms to lodgers. Bentley was Radcliffe&#x27;s maternal uncle, and more respectable as a land-owning member of the gentry. She often paid extended visits to his home in Chelsea, London and later Turnham Green. Wedgwood&#x27;s daughter Susannah, known by the nickname Sukey, also stayed in Chelsea and is Radcliffe&#x27;s only known childhood companion. Although mixing in some distinguished circles, Radcliffe seems to have made little impression in this society and was described by Wedgwood as &quot;Bentley&#x27;s shy little niece&quot;. Bentley and Wedgwood were both Unitarians, as was Radcliffe&#x27;s grand-uncle Dr. John Jebb. Radcliffe herself regularly attended Anglican church services, but her biographer Rictor Norton suggests that she remained sympathetic to Unitarian and Dissenters.
=== Marriage ===
In 1787, when Radcliffe was 23 years old, she married William Radcliffe (1763–1830), an Oxford-educated journalist. William had initially been a student of law, but he did not complete his legal studies and instead turned his attention to literature and journalism. The couple were married in Bath, but soon after moved to London, where William Radcliffe got a job working for a paper. He wrote for (and soon became the editor of) the &quot;Gazetteer and New Daily Advertiser&quot;, a campaigning newspaper that &quot;celebrated the French Revolution, freedom of the press, and Dissenters&#x27; rights.&quot;

Ann and William Radcliffe never had children. By many accounts, theirs was a happy marriage. Radcliffe called him her &quot;nearest relative and friend&quot;. According to Talfourd&#x27;s memoir, Ann started writing while her husband remained out late most evenings for work. She published her first novel, &quot;The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne,&quot; in 1789 at the age of 25, and published her next four novels in short succession. The money she earned from her novels later allowed her husband to quit his job, and the two of them travelled together, along with their dog, Chance. In 1794, they went to the Netherlands and Germany. This was Radcliffe&#x27;s only trip abroad, and it became the inspiration for a travelogue, titled &quot;A Journey Made in the Summer of 1794&quot;, that she published a year later. On this trip, the Radcliffes were initially meant to go on to Switzerland, but this plan was &quot;frustrated by a disobliging official, who refused to believe that they were English, and would not honour their passports.&quot; In 1795, William returned as editor of the &quot;Gazetteer&quot;, and a year later, he purchased the &quot;English Chronicle&quot; &quot;or&quot; &quot;Universal Evening Post&quot;, a Whig newspaper. Ann Radcliffe published &quot;The Italian&quot; in 1797, the last novel she would publish in her lifetime. She was paid £800 for it, which was three times her husband&#x27;s yearly income.

=== Later life ===
Radcliffe ceased publishing and lived privately for 26 years, with no explanation available to her many fans. She spent the rest of her adult life travelling and living a comfortable life with her husband and their dog, Chance. They travelled domestically almost once a year from 1797 to 1811, and in later years, the Radcliffes hired a carriage during the summer months so that they could make trips to places near London. Radcliffe continued to write. She wrote poetry and another novel, &quot;Gaston de Blondeville&quot;, which was not published until after her death. She was said to have suffered from asthma, for which she received regular treatment.

Radcliffe&#x27;s disinterest in public life led to frequent rumours that she had gone insane as a result of her writing, or lived in dramatic seclusion is Derbyshire. These rumours were so popular that Talfourd&#x27;s memoir included a statement from her physician that spoke about her mental condition in her later years. &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot; stated after her death that the tenor of Radcliffe&#x27;s life was characterized by the rare union of the literary gentlewoman and the active housewife. She was seen, every Sunday, at St James&#x27;s Church; almost every fine day in Hyde Park; sometimes at the theatres, and very frequently at the Opera.

=== Death and posthumous work ===
In 1823, Radcliffe went to Ramsgate, where she caught a fatal chest infection. She died 7 February 1823 at the age of 58 and was buried in a vault in the Chapel of Ease at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, London. Although she had suffered from asthma for twelve years previously, her modern biographer, Rictor Norton, argues that she likely died of pneumonia caused by a bronchial infection, citing the description given by her physician, Dr. Scudamore, of how &quot;a new inflammation seized the membranes of the brain&quot;.

Three years after her death, &quot;Gaston de Blondeville&quot; was published by Henry Colburn. It also contained some of her poetry and her essay &quot;On the Supernatural in Poetry&quot;, which outlines her distinction between terror and horror.

=== Biographies of Radcliffe ===
Walter Scott published a brief &quot;Prefatory memoir&quot; about Radcliffe in 1824, as part of &quot;The Novels of Mrs. Ann Radcliffe&quot; in the Ballantyne Novelist&#x27;s Library series. The best-known biography of Radcliffe was published as a preface to some of her posthumous works in 1826. It was written by Thomas Noon Talfourd, using extracts from Racdliffe&#x27;s journals and information provided by her husband. Many subsequent biographies have been written, but all faced the same problems of limited source material. Christina Rossetti, for example, attempted to write a biography of Radcliffe in 1883, but abandoned it for lack of information. Radcliffe&#x27;s journals are not extant, so the only material known from them is that which Talfourd excerpted. Only three documents directly related to Radcliffe could be located by the bibliographer Deborah D. Rogers in 1996: her forty-two page commonplace book, a note to someone named Miss Williamson, and her original contract for &quot;Udolpho&quot;.

Two full-length biographies were published in the mid twentieth century: Aline Grant&#x27;s &quot;Ann Radcliffe: A Biography&quot; (1951) and Pierre Arnaud&#x27;s &quot;Ann Radcliffe et le fantisque: essai de psychobiographie&quot; (1976). Rictor Norton, author of &quot;Mistress of Udolpho: The Life of Ann Radcliffe&quot; (1999), argues that these years were &quot;dominated by interpretation rather than scholarship&quot; where information (specifically on her rumoured madness) was repeated rather than traced to a reliable source. Deborah D. Rogers included a twenty-page summary of Radcliffe&#x27;s life in &quot;Ann Radcliffe: A Bio-Bibliography&quot; (1996), combining information from Talfourd with Radcliffe&#x27;s commonplace book. Norton&#x27;s 1999 biography, more than ten times the length, incorporates archival materials related to Radcliffe&#x27;s many relatives, as well as public discussion of her reputation, to expand on the context for her life.

==Literary life==
Radcliffe published five novels during her lifetime, which she always referred to as &quot;romances&quot;. Her first novel, &quot;The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne&quot;, was published anonymously in 1789. Early reviews were mostly unenthusiastic. &quot;The Monthly Review&quot; said that, while the novel was commendable for its morality, it appealed only to women and children: &quot;To men who have passed, or even attained, the meridian of life, a series of events, which seem not to have their foundation in nature, will ever be insipid, if not disgustful”. It was also largely criticized for its anachronisms and inauthentic renderings of the Scottish Highlands.

One year later, Radcliffe published her second novel, &quot;A Sicilian Romance&quot;, which proved a success, and, as Walter Scott recalled: &quot;we ourselves well recollect, attracted in no ordinary degree the attention of the public.&quot; In 1791, she published her third novel, &quot;The Romance of the Forest.&quot; Like her first two novels, this book was initially published anonymously. On the original title page, it stated that the novel was “By the Authoress of A Sicilian Romance”. &quot;The Romance of the Forest&quot; was popular with readers, and in the second edition, Radcliffe began adding her own name to the title page.

In 1794, three years later, Radcliffe published &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho.&quot; At a time when the average amount earned by an author for a manuscript was £10, her publishers, G. G. and J. Robinson, bought the copyright for this novel for £500, and it was a quick success. The money from this novel allowed her and her husband to travel to the Netherlands and Germany, which she described in her travelogue &quot;A Journey Made in the Summer of 1794&quot; (1795). In 1797, Radcliffe published &quot;The Italian,&quot; the last novel published in her lifetime. Cadell and Davies paid £800, making Radcliffe the highest-paid professional writer of the 1790s. This novel was written in response to Matthew Gregory Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Monk&quot; because Radcliffe did not like the direction in which Gothic literature was heading. Nick Groom, writes that in &quot;The Italian&quot;, Radcliffe &quot;takes the violence and eroticism that so titillated readers of &quot;The Monk&quot; and subsumes them beneath the veil and the cowl of oppressive Catholicism.&quot;

A final novel, &quot;Gaston de Blondeville&quot; was published posthumously in 1826. This novel was published with Talfourd&#x27;s memoir and Radcliffe&#x27;s unfinished essay &quot;On the Supernatural in Poetry&quot;, which details the difference between the sensation of terror her works aimed to achieve and the horror Lewis sought to evoke. Radcliffe stated that terror aims to stimulate readers through imagination and perceived evils, while horror closes them off through fear and physical dangers: &quot;Terror and Horror are so far opposite, that the first expands the soul and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life; the other contracts, freezes and nearly annihilates them.&quot;

Radcliffe portrayed her female characters as equal to male characters, allowing them to dominate and overtake the typically powerful male villains and heroes, creating new roles for women in literature previously not available. Radcliffe was also known for including supernatural elements but eventually giving readers a rational explanation for the supernatural. Usually, Radcliffe would reveal the logical excuse for what first appeared to be supernatural towards the end of her novels, which led to heightened suspense. Some critics and readers found this disappointing. Regarding Radcliffe&#x27;s penchant for explaining the supernatural, Walter Scott writes in &quot;Lives of the Novelists&quot; (1821–1824): “A stealthy step behind the arras may, doubtless, in some situations, and when the nerves are tuned to a certain pitch, have no small influence upon the imagination; but if the conscious listener discovers it to be only the noise made by the cat, the solemnity of the feeling is gone, and the visionary is at once angry with his sense for having been cheated, and with his reason for having acquiesced in the deception.&quot; Some modern critics have been frustrated by her work, as she fails to include &quot;real ghosts&quot;. This could be motivated by the idea that works in the Romantic period, from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century, sought to undermine Enlightenment values such as rationalism and realism.

== Anti-Catholicism ==
Radcliffe&#x27;s work have been considered by some scholars to be part of a larger tradition of anti-Catholicism within Gothic literature; her works contain hostile portrayals of both Catholicism and Catholics. &quot;The Italian&quot; frequently presents Catholicism, the largest religion in Italy, in a negative light. In the novel, Radcliffe portrays Catholic elements such as the Inquisition unfavourably, pointing to its discriminatory practises against non-Catholics. Radcliffe also portrays the confessional as a &quot;danger zone&quot; controlled by the power of the priest and the church. &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot; also contained negative portrayals of Catholicism; both novels are set in Catholic-majority Italy, and Catholicism was presented as being part of &quot;ancient Italianess&quot;. Italy, along with its Catholicism, had been featured in earlier Gothic literature; Horace Walpole&#x27;s novel &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; claimed in-universe that it was &quot;found in the library of an ancient catholic family in the north of England&quot; and &quot;printed at Naples, in the black letter, in the year 1529&quot;.

Some scholars have suggested that Radcliffe&#x27;s anti-Catholicism was partly a response to the 1791 Roman Catholic Relief Act passed by the British parliament, which was a major component of Catholic emancipation in Great Britain. Other scholars have suggested that Radcliffe was ultimately ambivalent towards Catholicism, claiming that she was a Latitudinarian.

==Gothic landscapes==
Radcliffe used the framing narrative of personifying nature in many of her novels. For example, she believed that the sublime motivated the protagonist to create an image that was more idealistic within the plot. Her elaborate descriptions of landscape were influenced by the painters Claude Lorrain, Nicolas Poussin, and Salvator Rosa. She often wrote about places she had never visited. Lorrain&#x27;s influence can be seen through Radcliffe&#x27;s picturesque, romantic descriptions, for example in the first volume of &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot;. Rosa&#x27;s influence can be seen through dark landscapes and elements of the Gothic.

Radcliffe once said of Claude:

==Influence on later writers==
Radcliffe influenced many later authors, both by inspiring more Gothic fiction and by inspiring parodies. In the eighteenth century, she inspired writers like Matthew Lewis (1775–1818) and the Marquis de Sade (1740–1814), who praised her work but produced more intensely violent fiction. Radcliffe is known for having spawned a large number of imitators of the &quot;Radcliffe School&quot;, such as Harriet Lee and Catherine Cuthbertson. Jane Austen (1775–1817) parodied &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot; in &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; (1817), and she defined her fiction as a contrast to Radcliffe and writers like her. Scholars have also perceived other apparent allusions to Radcliffe&#x27;s novels and life in Austen&#x27;s work.

In the early nineteenth century, Radcliffe influenced Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849), and Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832). Scott interspersed his work with poems in a similar manner to Radcliffe, and one assessment of her reads, &quot;Scott himself said that her prose was poetry and her poetry was prose. She was, indeed, a prose poet, in both the best and the worst senses of the phrase. The romantic landscape, the background, is the best thing in all her books; the characters are two dimensional, the plots far fetched and improbable, with &#x27;elaboration of means and futility of result&#x27;.&quot; Later in the nineteenth century, Charlotte and Emily Brontë continued Radcliffe&#x27;s Gothic tradition with their novels &quot;Jane Eyre, Villette,&quot; and &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot;

Radcliffe was also admired by French authors including Honoré de Balzac (1799–1850), Victor Hugo (1802–1885), Alexandre Dumas (1802–1870), George Sand (1804-1876), and Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867). Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s novel of the supernatural &quot;L&#x27;Héritière de Birague&quot; (1822) follows and parodies Radcliffe&#x27;s style. Mary Russell Mitford notes in a letter from 1849 the French admiration for Radcliffe:

The only one whom they appear really to appreciate is Mrs. Radcliffe — Anne Radcliffe, as they call her, for they do not even mis-spell her name. It is quite amusing to see how much a writer, wellnigh forgotten in England, is admired in France. I dare say, now, you never read a page of her novels, and yet such critics as Ste.-Beuve, such poets as Victor Hugo, such novelists as Balzac and George Sand, to say nothing of a thousand inferior writers, talk of her in raptures. I will venture to say that she is quoted fifty times where Scott is quoted once.&lt;br&gt;

As a child, Fyodor Dostoyevsky was deeply impressed by Radcliffe. In &quot;Winter Notes on Summer Impressions&quot; (1863) he writes, &quot;I used to spend the long winter hours before bed listening (for I could not yet read), agape with ecstasy and terror, as my parents read aloud to me from the novels of Ann Radcliffe. Then I would rave deliriously about them in my sleep.&quot; A number of scholars have noted elements of Gothic literature in Dostoyevsky&#x27;s novels, and some have tried to show direct influence of Radcliffe&#x27;s work.

==Fictional depictions==
In 1875, Paul Féval wrote a story starring Radcliffe as a vampire hunter, titled &quot;La Ville Vampire: Adventure Incroyable de Madame Anne Radcliffe&quot; (&quot;City of Vampires: The Incredible Adventure of Mrs. Anne Radcliffe&quot;), which blends fiction and history.

Helen McCrory plays Ann Radcliffe in the 2007 film &quot;Becoming Jane&quot;, starring Anne Hathaway as Jane Austen. The film depicts Radcliffe meeting the young Jane Austen and encouraging her to pursue a literary career. No evidence exists that such a meeting ever occurred.

<text>Circular dichroism (CD) is dichroism involving circularly polarized light, i.e., the differential absorption of left- and right-handed light. Left-hand circular (LHC) and right-hand circular (RHC) polarized light represent two possible spin angular momentum states for a photon, and so circular dichroism is also referred to as dichroism for spin angular momentum. This phenomenon was discovered by Jean-Baptiste Biot, Augustin Fresnel, and Aimé Cotton in the first half of the 19th century. Circular dichroism and circular birefringence are manifestations of optical activity. It is exhibited in the absorption bands of optically active chiral molecules. CD spectroscopy has a wide range of applications in many different fields. Most notably, far-UV CD is used to investigate the secondary structure of proteins. UV/Vis CD is used to investigate charge-transfer transitions. Near-infrared CD is used to investigate geometric and electronic structure by probing metal d→d transitions. Vibrational circular dichroism, which uses light from the infrared energy region, is used for structural studies of small organic molecules, and most recently proteins and DNA.

==Physical Principles==

===Circular polarization of light===

Electromagnetic radiation consists of an electric formula_1 and magnetic formula_2 field that oscillate perpendicular to one another and to the propagating direction, a transverse wave. While linearly polarized light occurs when the electric field vector oscillates only in one plane, circularly polarized light occurs when the direction of the electric field vector rotates about its propagation direction while the vector retains constant magnitude. At a single point in space, the circularly polarized-vector will trace out a circle over one period of the wave frequency, hence the name. The two diagrams below show the electric field vectors of linearly and circularly polarized light, at one moment of time, for a range of positions; the plot of the circularly polarized electric vector forms a helix along the direction of propagation formula_3. For left circularly polarized light (LCP) with propagation towards the observer, the electric vector rotates counterclockwise. For right circularly polarized light (RCP), the electric vector rotates clockwise.

===Interaction of circularly polarized light with matter===
When circularly polarized light passes through an absorbing optically active medium, the speeds between right and left polarizations differ (formula_4) as well as their wavelength(formula_5) and the extent to which they are absorbed (formula_6). &quot;Circular dichroism&quot; is the difference formula_7. The electric field of a light beam causes a linear displacement of charge when interacting with a molecule (electric dipole), whereas its magnetic field causes a circulation of charge (magnetic dipole). These two motions combined cause an excitation of an electron in a helical motion, which includes translation and rotation and their associated operators. The experimentally determined relationship between the rotational strength formula_8 of a sample and the formula_9 is given by
:formula_10
The rotational strength has also been determined theoretically,
:formula_11
We see from these two equations that in order to have non-zero formula_9, the electric and magnetic dipole moment operators (formula_13 and formula_14) must transform as the same irreducible representation. formula_15 and formula_16 are the only point groups where this can occur, making only chiral molecules CD active.

Simply put, since circularly polarized light itself is &quot;chiral&quot;, it interacts differently with chiral molecules. That is, the two types of circularly polarized light are absorbed to different extents. In a CD experiment, equal amounts of left and right circularly polarized light of a selected wavelength are alternately radiated into a (chiral) sample. One of the two polarizations is absorbed more than the other one, and this wavelength-dependent difference of absorption is measured, yielding the CD spectrum of the sample. Due to the interaction with the molecule, the electric field vector of the light traces out an elliptical path after passing through the sample.

It is important that the chirality of the molecule can be conformational rather than structural. That is, for instance, a protein molecule with a helical secondary structure can have a CD that changes with changes in the conformation.

====Delta absorbance====
By definition,

:formula_17

where formula_18 (Delta Absorbance) is the difference between absorbance of left circularly polarized (LCP) and right circularly polarized (RCP) light (this is what is usually measured). formula_18 is a function of wavelength, so for a measurement to be meaningful the wavelength at which it was performed must be known.

====Molar circular dichroism====
It can also be expressed, by applying Beer&#x27;s law, as:

:formula_20

where
:formula_21 and formula_22 are the molar extinction coefficients for LCP and RCP light,
:&quot;formula_23&quot; is the molar concentration,
:&quot;formula_24&quot; is the path length in centimeters (cm).

Then

:formula_25

is the molar circular dichroism. This intrinsic property is what is usually meant by the circular dichroism of the substance. Since formula_26 is a function of wavelength, a molar circular dichroism value (formula_26) must specify the wavelength at which it is valid.

====Extrinsic effects on circular dichroism====
In many practical applications of circular dichroism (CD), as discussed below, the measured CD is not simply an intrinsic property of the molecule, but rather depends on the molecular conformation. In such a case the CD may also be a function of temperature, concentration, and the chemical environment, including solvents. In this case the reported CD value must also specify these other relevant factors in order to be meaningful.

In ordered structures lacking two-fold rotational symmetry, optical activity, including differential transmission (and reflection) of circularly polarized waves also depends on the propagation direction through the material. In this case, so-called extrinsic 3d chirality is associated with the mutual orientation of light beam and structure.

====Molar ellipticity====

Although formula_28 is usually measured, for historical reasons most measurements are reported in degrees of ellipticity.
Molar ellipticity is circular dichroism corrected for concentration. Molar circular dichroism and molar ellipticity, formula_29, are readily interconverted by the equation:

:formula_30

This relationship is derived by defining the ellipticity of the polarization as:

:formula_31

where
:formula_32 and formula_33 are the magnitudes of the electric field vectors of the right-circularly and left-circularly polarized light, respectively.

When formula_32 equals formula_33 (when there is no difference in the absorbance of right- and left-circular polarized light), formula_36 is 0° and the light is linearly polarized. When either formula_32 or formula_33 is equal to zero (when there is complete absorbance of the circular polarized light in one direction), formula_36 is 45° and the light is circularly polarized.

Generally, the circular dichroism effect is small, so formula_40 is small and can be approximated as formula_36 in radians. Since the intensity or irradiance, formula_42, of light is proportional to the square of the electric-field vector, the ellipticity becomes:

:formula_43

Then by substituting for I using Beer&#x27;s law in natural logarithm form:

:formula_44

The ellipticity can now be written as:

:formula_45

Since formula_46, this expression can be approximated by expanding the exponentials in a Taylor series to first-order and then discarding terms of formula_28 in comparison with unity and converting from radians to degrees:

:formula_48

The linear dependence of solute concentration and pathlength is removed by defining molar ellipticity as,

:formula_49

Then combining the last two expression with Beer&#x27;s law, molar ellipticity becomes:

:formula_50

The units of molar ellipticity are historically (deg·cm2/dmol). To calculate molar ellipticity, the sample concentration (g/L), cell pathlength (cm), and the molecular weight (g/mol) must be known.

If the sample is a protein, the mean residue weight (average molecular weight of the amino acid residues it contains) is often used in place of the molecular weight, essentially treating the protein as a solution of amino acids. Using mean residue ellipticity facilitates comparing the CD of proteins of different molecular weight; use of this normalized CD is important in studies of protein structure.

====Mean residue ellipticity====
Methods for estimating secondary structure in polymers, proteins and polypeptides in particular, often require that the measured molar ellipticity spectrum be converted to a normalized value, specifically a value independent of the polymer length. Mean residue ellipticity is used for this purpose; it is simply the measured molar ellipticity of the molecule divided by the number of monomer units (residues) in the molecule.

==Application to Biological Molecules==

Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is a powerful tool in biophysical and biochemical research, providing unique insights into the structural and stability characteristics of biomolecules. Because CD arises from the differential absorption of left- and right-circularly polarized light by optically active molecules, it is inherently sensitive to the chiral nature of biological macromolecules. This makes it particularly valuable for analyzing secondary structures, as seen in the characteristic CD spectral signatures of the α-helices and β-sheets of proteins and the double helices of nucleic acids. While high-resolution techniques such as X-ray crystallography, NMR, and cryo-EM reveal atomic-level structural details, and interaction-based methods like ITC and SPR probe molecular interactions, CD spectroscopy offers a rapid, label-free means of detecting structural changes and stability shifts. Its ability to provide complementary data makes it an essential component of the modern biophysical toolbox, with applications spanning virtually every field of biomolecular research. CD spectroscopy is widely used in academia and the biopharmaceutical industry to study biomolecules, particularly proteins and peptides. CD spectra provide valuable insights into both secondary and tertiary structure.

Secondary structure information is derived from signals arising from peptide bonds that absorb in the far-UV range (spanning approximately 180 nm to 260 nm), enabling the identification and fractional assignments of structural elements such as the alpha-helix, beta-sheet, beta-turn, and random coil. These structural assignments place important constraints on the possible secondary conformations that the protein can be in. CD cannot, in general, say where the alpha helices that are detected are located within the molecule or even completely predict how many there are. Despite this, CD is a valuable tool, especially for showing changes in conformation. It can, for instance, be used to study how the secondary structure of a molecule changes as a function of temperature (in a thermal denaturation temperature ramp experiment) or of the concentration of denaturing agents (in a chemical denaturation experiment), e.g. guanidinium chloride or urea. In this way it can reveal important thermodynamic information about the molecule (such as the enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of denaturation) that cannot otherwise be easily obtained. Anyone attempting to study a protein will find CD a valuable tool for verifying that the protein is in its native conformation (i.e., as a quality control technique) before undertaking extensive and/or expensive experiments with it. Moreover, CD spectroscopy has been used in bioinorganic interface studies; specifically, it has been used to analyze the differences in secondary structure of an engineered protein before and after titration with a reagent.

Insight into tertiary structure is obtained from spectral contributions of aromatic amino acids, which absorb in the near-UV range (spanning approximately 250 nm to 350 nm). The signals obtained in this region are due to the absorption, dipole orientation, and nature of the surrounding environment of the phenylalanine, tyrosine, cysteine (or S-S disulfide bridges) and tryptophan amino acids. Unlike in far-UV CD, the near-UV CD spectrum cannot be assigned to any particular 3D structure. Rather, the near-UV range can be considered a fingerprint region because its spectral profile is exquisitely dependent on the composition of aromatic residues and the conformation and environment of their side chains.

Visible CD spectra (spanning approximately 350 nm to 700 nm) provide structural information on the nature of the prosthetic groups in proteins, e.g., the heme groups in hemoglobin and cytochrome c. Visible CD spectroscopy is a very powerful technique to study metal–protein interactions and can resolve individual d–d electronic transitions as separate bands. CD spectra in the visible light region are generally only produced when a metal ion is in a chiral environment, thus, free metal ions in solution are not detected. This has the advantage of only observing the protein-bound metal, so pH dependence and stoichiometries are readily obtained. Optical activity in transition metal ion complexes have been attributed to configurational, conformational, and vicinal effects. Klewpatinond and Viles (2007) have produced a set of empirical rules for predicting the appearance of visible CD spectra for Cu(II) and Ni(II) square-planar complexes involving histidine and main-chain coordination.

Beyond proteins and peptides, UV-CD spectroscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing the secondary structure of nucleic acids, providing insight into DNA helices and RNA structural motifs such as G-quadruplexes. Different DNA conformations—A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA—exhibit distinct CD spectral signatures due to variations in base stacking and helical geometry. Similarly, RNA structures, including stem-loops, pseudoknots, and G-quadruplexes, produce unique CD spectra that reflect their specific folding patterns and base interactions. G-quadruplexes, in particular, show characteristic positive and negative bands in the CD spectrum depending on their topology (parallel, antiparallel, or hybrid). These spectral features make UV-CD an essential technique for studying nucleic acid folding, stability, and interactions with ligands.

CD gives less specific structural information than X-ray crystallography and protein NMR spectroscopy, for example, which both give atomic resolution data. However, CD spectroscopy is a quick method that does not require large amounts of proteins or extensive data processing. Thus CD can be used to survey many solvent conditions, varying temperature, pH, salinity, and the presence of various cofactors.

CD spectroscopy is usually used to study proteins in solution, and thus it complements methods that study the solid state. This is also a limitation, in that many proteins are embedded in membranes in their native state, and solutions containing membrane structures are often strongly scattering. CD can also be measured in thin films and powders. For instance, CD spectroscopy has been conducted on solid state semiconducting materials such as TiO2 to obtain large signals in the UV wavelength range, where the electronic transitions for biomolecules often occur.

== Higher Order Structure (HOS) Comparisons ==
Modern protein CD spectroscopy is most powerful for comparative analysis of secondary and tertiary structure, commonly referred to as Higher Order Structure, or HOS, comparisons. Examples include assessing batch-to-batch consistency in biotherapeutics, evaluating the effects of mutations, and studying the properties of charge variants or glycovariants to a parent protein. HOS analysis is also highly effective for studying the impact of formulation excipients, pH, and ionic strength on protein conformation.

HOS comparisons have a wide range of applications and play a critical role at every stage of biotherapeutic development—from early-stage analytical assessments to late-stage quality control; from formulation development to forced degradation shelf stability assessments.

Higher order structure comparisons leverage both far- and near-UV wavelength ranges to enable statistically robust, reproducible, and quantifiable data analysis. An HOS comparison quantitatively evaluates whether any two spectra differ and, by extension, whether their underlying structural information is different. This is often difficult, if not impossible, to do by visual inspection. Detecting these subtle differences requires multiple independent spectra and robust statistical analysis, as many variations are too small to be discernible by eye.

There are various approaches to HOS comparisons and numerous spectral comparison methods are described in the literature, however, regardless of the HOS comparison method or application, all methods are mathematical approaches that have the same goal of yielding a single value as a measure of similarity for pair-wise spectral comparisons. One such method is the Weighted Spectral Difference (WSD) method, an HOS comparison method favored by many biopharmaceutical companies and regulatory authorities.

Over the last decade, HOS comparisons have been established as an essential tool to consolidate CD data in submissions for new biologics drug applications. Particularly in biosimilars development, HOS comparisons are indispensable to meet requirements by the FDA, EMA, and other regulatory bodies. The rationale for this guidance is to regulate and control the safety, quality, and efficacy of therapeutic agents available to the public.

== Additional Applications and Related Techniques ==

=== Fluorescence ===
Fluorescence measurements in CD spectroscopy, recorded at a 90 degree angle to the incident light, often serve as a complementary data channel, providing additional insights into protein stability and conformational changes. By detecting intrinsic fluorescence from aromatic residues such as tryptophan and tyrosine, researchers can assess environmental shifts that accompany structural transitions. Fluorescence data can be acquired alongside CD signals, particularly in temperature ramp experiments, where it helps monitor unfolding events by tracking changes in emission intensity or wavelength shifts. This process could be followed by recording CD spectra at intervals of 1 °C, for example, while increasing the temperature continuously at 1 °C per minute. The excitation bandwidth required for the fluorescence spectra is usually larger than what would be used as spectral bandwidth for CD measurements, so sometimes the use of different spectral bandwidths for CD and fluorescence measurements is necessary. This dual approach enhances the interpretation of protein behavior under varying conditions, improving confidence in structural and stability assessments.

There are multiple approaches to collecting fluorescence data, including the use of a photomultiplier tube (PMT) to record total fluorescence, the use of a CCD fluorometer to record full-spectrum fluorescence, or the use of a scanning emission monochromator (SEM) to allow for scanning the fluorescence spectrum at a fixed excitation wavelength.

=== Optical Rotatory Dispersion (ORD) ===
CD is closely related to the technique of optical rotatory dispersion (ORD). Optical rotation is the rotation of linearly polarized light as a result of it passing through an optically active material, and is a consequence of a difference in refractive index between the left and right circularly polarized components of the light (linearly polarized light can be considered to be an equal combination of right and left circularly polarized light). Optical rotatory dispersion is the variation in optical rotation with wavelength. ORD and CD spectra both derive from the interaction of polarized (circularly or linearly) light with chiral molecules and are directly related: each can be derived from the other using the Kramers-Kronig transform. Measurements of ORD and CD give essentially the same information, but experimentally each technique has been favored for particular applications. CD is the higher resolution technique since it is only observed at wavelengths where the chiral molecule absorbs light. This makes complicated spectra involving multiple absorbance bands easier to interpret. Alternatively, ORD measurements can be obtained at wavelengths where the chiral molecule being measured does not necessarily absorb light. This means that ORD measurements can be made on materials with high concentrations or where absorbance bands are obscured by solvent or buffer salt absorbance. ORD is particularly useful for unsubstituted sugars as this class of biomolecule does not possess chromophores that absorb in the UV-Vis regions accessible via commercial CD instruments.

=== Linear Dichroism (LD) ===
With the appropriate accessory, it is possible to perform linear dichroism (LD) measurements on CD spectrophotometers. Linear dichroism is the difference in the absorbance of light polarized parallel and perpendicular to an orientation axis:

ΔA = Apara - Aperp

where A is the absorbance of the linearly polarized light, and the subscripts indicate parallel and perpendicular, respectively. For a sample to have non-zero LD it must be anisotropic; the anisotropy may be intrinsic, as in liquid crystals for example, or it may be induced, for example, by stretching a polymer film, by the application of an electrical field, or by alignment or deformation in a shear field (e.g., nucleic acids such as DNA).

An LD device uses a Couette cell to generate a shear field. The sample is contained in the annular gap between two concentric quartz cylinders, the outer of which, the rotor, is rotated about its cylindrical axis, while the inner, the stator, is stationary. This arrangement is named after its originator, Maurice Couette.

Shearing can cause large particles in the liquid to align or deform. For example, rigid, rod-like particles, such as carbon nanotubes and glass fibers, will align, whereas vesicles, micelles, and flexible polymers will deform from their equilibrium conformations, extending in the direction of shear. Linear dichroism is then used to determine the direction of net electron transfer in an absorbed chromophore relative to the shear direction, and thereby to the alignment direction of the absorbing species or the deformation direction of its environment.

=== Magnetic Circular Dichroism (MCD) ===
Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) is the differential absorption of left and right circularly polarized light in the presence of a magnetic field oriented parallel to the direction of light propagation. MCD differs from natural CD in that it does not require a chiral sample; the origins of CD and MCD are quite different.

There are three contributions to an MCD spectrum, known as the A-, B-, and C-terms. At room temperature, the A- and B-terms dominate, especially for non-magnetic chromophores, and form the majority of what can be observed in a standard MCD experiment.

The A-term is due to Zeeman splitting of degenerate excited states by a difference in spin. The result is a small shift apart in the wavelengths of the UV-Visible spectrum for each spin state, with each state preferentially absorbing left or right circularly polarized light. The A-term MCD spectrum is observed as a derivative of an absorbance transition with a sharp transition around the absorbance peak. Because of the A-term bands, the MCD spectrum is more structured than the absorbance or natural CD spectrum, multiple overlapping chromophores can be quantified much more easily, and changes in individual chromophores can be tracked.

The B-term is due to mixing of non-degenerate ground states. It is normally observed as a single absorption band type peak, which may be either positive or negative.

The C-term is due to changes in populations of molecules over the Zeeman sublevels due to the response to the field of a paramagnetic ground state. They become significant in the MCD spectrum only at very low temperatures, and the instrumentation requirements of high field strengths and cryogenic temperatures are very similar to those of the related technique of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). This is an expensive and dedicated system, and access to the C-terms is therefore beyond the scope of an easily interchangeable MCD accessory on a benchtop CD instrument.

Collection of MCD data is similar to that of natural CD, except that there are two possible orientations of the magnet, with either the north or south pole closer to the detector. Normally a spectrum is acquired with the magnet in each orientation; since the MCD contribution to the spectrum changes sign when the magnetic field is reversed, whereas the natural CD contribution does not, both contributions can be obtained by averaging the two spectra.

For further information on MCD see this book.

=== Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) ===
Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) is the emission analog of CD. While CD examines the geometry of molecules in their ground state, CPL, typically observed perpendicular to the incident light beam, provides insight into the geometry of molecules in their excited or luminescent state. In a CPL experiment, the emitted light is analyzed for its contents of left and right circularly polarized light.

The difference in intensity between left and right circularly polarized emitted light, Δ&quot;I&quot;, is given by:

Δ&quot;I&quot; = &quot;I&quot;L – &quot;I&quot;R

where I&quot;L and I&quot;R are the intensity of left and right circularly polarized emitted light, respectively. The average luminescence intensity is given by:

&quot;I&quot; = (&quot;I&quot;L + &quot;I&quot;R) / 2

Both Δ&quot;I and I&quot; are in relative units because in luminescence experiments not all the luminescent light is detected, only that in a restricted solid angle. Moreover, an absolute value for the concentration of luminescent molecules may be hard to obtain. For these reasons, a dissymmetry factor in the luminescence is defined as:

g&quot;lum = Δ&quot;I&quot; / &quot;I

with &quot;g&quot;lum being an absolute number that is unique to each CPL-active molecule under specific conditions.

Many commercially available CD spectrophotometers can be adapted with an accessory to measure the circularly polarized luminescence of a sample.

=== Analysis of solid samples ===
It is possible to analyze solid-state samples by CD spectroscopy. There are a few options to accomplish this.

Samples are often prepared in the form of discs, either by compression with an inert dispersant such as potassium bromide or potassium chloride or by deposition of the sample as a thin film on top of the disc. This technique is well established in IR absorbance spectroscopy, and it has also been used in UV/visible spectroscopy. The sample is measured in transmission mode, with the light passing through the sample to a detector mounted in the spectrometer transmission port. To eliminate the effect of anisotropy, the sample is usually mounted in a wheel and can be manually rotated to allow measurements to be made at several angular positions. The spectra of all positions can then be averaged.

If the solid samples exist in the form of a powder, they can be measured via diffuse reflectance by using a device known as an integrating sphere.

Integrating spheres were developed early in the twentieth century and were originally used to measure the total output of a light source without reference to the original direction of the light. They are now commonly used when measuring the UV/visible or IR absorption spectra of solid samples, and their use can be extended to the UV/visible CD spectroscopy of solids.

Light enters the sphere through an inlet port, and the internal surfaces of the sphere are usually white, reflective, and diffuse, so that the light becomes equally distributed within the sphere through multiple scattering reflections. A detector is placed at an outlet port and the intensity of the light is measured. For CD spectroscopy, the sample can be placed either at the inlet port, so that the light passes through it before entering the sphere, or at a point on the sphere opposite the inlet port, so that light is diffusely reflected from the sample after entering the sphere. These two operating modes are called transmission and diffuse reflectance, respectively. In both cases the sample is prepared in powder form. For transmission mode, it must then be dispersed in either potassium bromide or potassium chloride and compressed into a disc. For diffuse reflectance mode, it remains as a free powder, if necessary dispersed in a diluent such as barium sulphate or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).

=== Studying fast reactions ===
Many commercially available CD spectrophotometers are designed to be outfitted with a stopped-flow device for studying the kinetics of fast reactions in solution. In the simplest form of the technique, the solutions of two reactants are rapidly mixed by being forced through a mixing chamber, on emerging from which the mixed fluid passes through an optical observation cell. At some point in time, the flow is suddenly stopped, and the reaction is monitored using a suitable spectroscopic probe, such as absorbance, fluorescence, fluorescence polarization, or circular dichroism. The change in spectroscopic signal as a function of time is recorded, and the rate constants that define the reaction kinetics can then be obtained by fitting the data using a suitable model.

== Experimental Limitations ==
CD has also been studied in carbohydrates, but with limited success due to the experimental difficulties associated with measurement of CD spectra in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region of the spectrum (100 to 200 nm), where the corresponding CD bands of unsubstituted carbohydrates lie. Substituted carbohydrates with bands above the VUV region have been successfully measured.

Measurement of far-UV CD is also complicated by the fact that typical aqueous buffer systems at physiological buffer and salt concentrations often significantly absorb in the far-UV range. Phosphate, Tris, and HEPES are tolerated, but the concentration should be minimized (e.g., ideally 10-20 mM). Buffer salts also exhibit surprisingly high absorbance at the lower end of the far-UV range and it should be endeavored to stay below approximately 50 mM (pathlength dependent). Some experimenters have substituted fluoride for chloride ion because fluoride absorbs less in the far UV, and some have worked in pure water. Even water itself will absorb below approximately 180 nm. One notable workaround includes switching from H2O to D2O, thus potentially enabling measurements to as low as 171 nm. Because CD is fundamentally an absorption technique and obeys Beer’s Law, another trick is to minimize buffer absorption by using shorter path length cells/cuvettes when working in the far-UV; 0.1-0.5 mm path lengths are not uncommon in this work. On the other hand, near-UV experiments do not suffer from most of these considerations and are typically conducted at higher concentrations in standard 10 mm pathlength cuvettes. Concentration and pathlength form a mathematical product to make absorbance and are therefore linearly interchangeable to achieve the same absorbance value.

In addition to measuring in aqueous systems, CD, particularly far-UV CD, can be measured in organic solvents e.g. ethanol, methanol, acetonitrile, trifluoroethanol (TFE) up to varying percentages of organic solvent. TFE has the advantage of being well-tolerated and inducing structure formation of proteins, inducing beta-sheets in some and alpha helices in others, which would not be observed under normal aqueous conditions. Many common organic solvents such as acetone, THF, dioxane, chloroform, and dichloromethane are generally incompatible with far-UV CD.

It may be of interest to note that the protein CD spectra used in secondary structure estimation are related to the π to π* and n to π* orbital transitions of the amide bonds in the amino acid backbone. These absorption bands lie partly in the so-called vacuum ultraviolet (wavelengths less than about 200 nm). The wavelength region of interest is actually inaccessible in air because of the strong absorption of light by oxygen at these wavelengths, which also results in the production of ozone. Ozone is a highly reactive gas that is damaging to health and to the optical components of the spectrometer. Moreover, even trace amounts of oxygen or ozone present in the lamp or monochromator will hinder acquisition of CD data. Ozone has a strong and broad absorbance peak at approximately 250 nm, and a further broad peak around 600 nm, thereby attenuating the light from the spectrometer lamp across a large portion of its wavelength range, particularly in the UV region. In practice these spectra are measured not in vacuum but in an oxygen-free instrument (purged with high-pure nitrogen gas from a tank or dewar).

Once oxygen has been eliminated, perhaps the second most important technical factor in working below 200 nm is to design the rest of the optical system to have low losses in this region. Critical in this regard is the use of aluminized mirrors whose coatings have been optimized for low loss in the far-UV region of the spectrum.

The usual light source in these instruments is a high pressure, xenon arc lamp. Xenon light sources are very stable and produce a broad and even emission spectrum from the far-UV through the near-IR. Ordinary xenon arc lamps are unsuitable for use in the low UV. Instead, specially constructed xenon arc lamps with envelopes made from high-purity synthetic fused silica must be used.

Light from synchrotron sources has a much higher flux at short wavelengths, and has been used to record CD down to 160 nm. In 2010 the CD spectrophotometer at the electron storage ring facility ISA at the University of Aarhus in Denmark was used to record solid state CD spectra down to 120 nm.
At the quantum mechanical level, the feature density of circular dichroism and optical rotation are identical. Optical rotary dispersion and circular dichroism share the same quantum information content.

<text>Herman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912 – January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century.

Frye gained international fame with his first book, &quot;Fearful Symmetry&quot; (1947), which led to the reinterpretation of the poetry of William Blake. His lasting reputation rests principally on the theory of literary criticism that he developed in &quot;Anatomy of Criticism&quot; (1957), one of the most important works of literary theory published in the twentieth century. The American critic Harold Bloom commented at the time of its publication that &quot;Anatomy&quot; established Frye as &quot;the foremost living student of Western literature.&quot; Frye&#x27;s contributions to cultural and social criticism spanned a long career during which he earned widespread recognition and received many honours.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Born in Sherbrooke, Quebec, but raised in Moncton, New Brunswick, Frye was the third child of Herman Edward Frye and of Catherine Maud Howard. His much older brother, Howard, died in World War I; he also had a sister, Vera. His first cousin was the scientist Alma Howard. Frye went to Toronto to compete in a national typing contest in 1929. He studied for his undergraduate degree in philosophy at Victoria College in the University of Toronto, where he edited the college literary journal, &quot;Acta Victoriana&quot;. He then studied theology at Emmanuel College (like Victoria College, a constituent part of the University of Toronto). After a brief stint as a student minister in Saskatchewan, he was ordained to the ministry of the United Church of Canada. He then studied at Merton College, Oxford, where he was a member and Secretary of the Bodley Club before returning to Victoria College, where he spent the remainder of his professional career.

===Academic and writing career===
Frye rose to international prominence as a result of his first book, &quot;Fearful Symmetry&quot;, published in 1947. Until then, the prophetic poetry of William Blake had long been poorly understood, and considered by some to be delusional ramblings. Frye found in it a system of metaphor derived from &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and the Bible. His study of Blake&#x27;s poetry was a major contribution to the subject. Moreover, Frye outlined an innovative manner of studying literature that was to deeply influence the study of literature in general. He was a major influence on Harold Bloom, Margaret Atwood, and others.

In 1974–1975 Frye was the Norton professor at Harvard University. But his primary position was as a professor at the University of Toronto, and then chancellor of Victoria College in the University of Toronto.

Northrop Frye did not have a PhD.

The intelligence service of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police spied on Frye, watching his participation in the anti–Vietnam War movement, an academic forum about China, and activism to end South African apartheid.

===Family life===
Frye married Helen Kemp, an educator, editor and artist, in 1937. She died in Australia while accompanying Frye on a lecture tour. Two years after her death in 1986, he remarried to Elizabeth Eedy Brown, the widow of politician James Elisha Brown and the sister of writer Alice Boissonneau. He died in 1991 and was interred in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto, Ontario.

==Contribution to literary criticism==
The insights gained from his study of Blake set Frye on his critical path and shaped his contributions to literary criticism and theory. He was the first critic to postulate a systematic theory of criticism, &quot;to work out,&quot; in his own words, &quot;a unified commentary on the theory of literary criticism&quot; (&quot;Stubborn Structure&quot; 160). In so doing, he shaped the discipline of criticism. Inspired by his work on Blake, Frye developed and articulated his unified theory ten years after &quot;Fearful Symmetry&quot;, in the &quot;Anatomy of Criticism&quot; (1957). He described this as an attempt at a &quot;synoptic view of the scope, theory, principles, and techniques of literary criticism&quot; (&quot;Anatomy&quot; 3). He asked, &quot;what if criticism is a science as well as an art?&quot; (7), Thus, Frye launched the pursuit which was to occupy the rest of his career—that of establishing criticism as a &quot;coherent field of study which trains the imagination quite as systematically and efficiently as the sciences train the reason&quot; (Hamilton 34).

===Criticism as a science===
As A. C. Hamilton outlines in &quot;Northrop Frye: Anatomy of his Criticism&quot;, Frye&#x27;s assumption of coherence for literary 
criticism carries important implications. Firstly and most fundamentally, it presupposes that literary criticism is a discipline in its own right, independent of literature. Claiming with John Stuart Mill that &quot;the artist… is not heard but overheard,&quot; Frye insists that
This &quot;declaration of independence&quot; (Hart xv) is necessarily a measured one for Frye. For coherence requires that the autonomy of criticism, the need to eradicate its conception as &quot;a parasitic form of literary expression,… a second-hand imitation of creative power&quot; (&quot;Anatomy&quot; 3), sits in dynamic tension with the need to establish integrity for it as a discipline. For Frye, this kind of coherent, critical integrity involves claiming a body of knowledge for criticism that, while independent of literature, is yet constrained by it: &quot;If criticism exists,&quot; he declares, &quot;it must be an examination of literature in terms of a conceptual framework derivable from an inductive survey of the literary field&quot; itself (&quot;Anatomy&quot; 7).

===Frye&#x27;s conceptual framework for literature===
In seeking integrity for criticism, Frye rejects what he termed the deterministic fallacy. He defines this as the movement of &quot;a scholar with a special interest in geography or economics [to] express . . . that interest by the rhetorical device of putting his favorite study into a causal relationship with whatever interests him less&quot; (&quot;Anatomy&quot; 6). By attaching criticism to an external framework rather than locating the framework for criticism within literature, this kind of critic essentially &quot;substitute[s] a critical attitude for criticism.&quot; For Frye critical integrity means that &quot;the axioms and postulates of criticism . . . have to grow out of the art it deals with&quot; (&quot;Anatomy&quot; 6).
Taking his cue from Aristotle, Frye&#x27;s methodology in defining a conceptual framework begins inductively, &quot;follow[ing] the natural order and begin[ning] with the primary facts&quot; (&quot;Anatomy&quot; 15). The primary facts, in this case, are the works of literature themselves. And what did Frye&#x27;s inductive survey of these &quot;facts&quot; reveal? Significantly, they revealed &quot;a general tendency on the part of great classics to revert to [primitive formulas]&quot; (&quot;Anatomy&quot; 17). This revelation prompted his next move, or rather, &#x27;inductive leap&#x27;:
I suggest that it is time for criticism to leap to a new ground from which it can discover what the organizing or containing forms of its conceptual framework are. Criticism seems to be badly in need of a coordinating
principle, a central hypothesis which, like the theory of evolution in biology, will see the phenomena it deals with as parts of a whole (&quot;Anatomy&quot; 16).

Arguing that &quot;criticism cannot be a systematic [and thus scientific] study unless there is a quality in literature which enables it to be so,&quot; Frye puts forward the hypothesis that &quot;just as there is an order of nature behind the natural sciences, so literature is not a piled aggregate of &#x27;works,&#x27; but an order of words&quot; (&quot;Anatomy&quot; 17). This order of words constitutes criticism&#x27;s conceptual framework, its coordinating principle.

===The order of words===
The recurring primitive formulas Frye noticed in his survey of the &quot;greatest classics&quot; provide literature with an order of words, a &quot;skeleton&quot; which allows the reader &quot;to respond imaginatively to any literary work by seeing it in the larger perspective provided by its literary and social contexts&quot; (Hamilton 20). Frye identifies these formulas as the &quot;conventional myths and metaphors&quot; which he calls &quot;archetypes&quot; (&quot;Spiritus Mundi&quot; 118). The archetypes of literature exist, Frye argues, as an order of words, providing criticism with a conceptual framework and a body of knowledge derived not from an ideological system but rooted in the imagination itself. Thus, rather than interpreting literary works from some ideological &#x27;position&#x27; — what Frye calls the &quot;superimposed critical attitude&quot; (&quot;Anatomy&quot; 7) — criticism instead finds integrity within the literary field itself.

Criticism for Frye, then, is not a task of evaluation — that is, of rejecting or accepting a literary work — but rather simply of recognizing it for what it is and understanding it in relation to other works within the &#x27;order of words&#x27; (Cotrupi 4). Imposing value judgments on literature belongs, according to Frye, &quot;only to the history of taste, and therefore follows the vacillations of fashionable prejudice&quot; (&quot;Anatomy&quot; 9). Genuine criticism &quot;progresses toward making the whole of literature intelligible&quot; (&quot;Anatomy&quot; 9) so that its goal is ultimately knowledge and not evaluation. For the critic in Frye&#x27;s mode, then,

... a literary work should be contemplated as a pattern of knowledge, an act that must be distinguished, at least initially, from any direct experience of the work, . . . [Thus] criticism begins when reading ends: no longer imaginatively subjected to a literary work, the critic tries to make sense out of it, not by going to some historical context or by commenting on the immediate experience of reading but by seeing its structure within literature and literature within culture (Hamilton 27).

===A theory of the imagination===
Once asked whether his critical theory was Romantic, Frye responded, &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s entirely Romantic, yes&quot; (Stingle 1). It is Romantic in the same sense that Frye attributed Romanticism to Blake: that is, &quot;in the expanded sense of giving a primary place to imagination and individual feeling&quot; (Stingle 2). As artifacts of the imagination, literary works, including &quot;the pre-literary categories of ritual, myth, and folk-tale&quot; (&quot;Archetypes&quot; 1450) form, in Frye&#x27;s vision, a potentially unified imaginative experience. He reminds us that literature is the &quot;central and most important extension&quot; of mythology: &quot;... every human society possesses a mythology which is inherited, transmitted and diversified by literature&quot; (&quot;Words with Power&quot; xiii). Mythology and literature thus inhabit and function within the same imaginative world, one that is &quot;governed by conventions, by its own modes, symbols, myths and genres&quot; (Hart 23). Integrity for criticism requires that it too operates within the sphere of the imagination, and not seek an organizing principle in ideology. To do so, claims Frye,
... leaves out the central structural principles that literature derives from myth, the principles that give literature its communicating power across the centuries through all ideological changes. Such structural principles are certainly conditioned by social and historical factors and do not transcend them, but they retain a continuity of form that points to an identity of the literary organism distinct from all its adaptations to its social environment (&quot;Words with Power&quot; xiii).

Myth therefore provides structure to literature simply because literature as a whole is &quot;displaced mythology&quot; (Bates 21). Hart makes the point well when he states that &quot;For Frye, the story, and not the argument, is at the centre of literature and society. The base of society is mythical and narrative and not ideological and dialectical&quot; (19). This idea, which is central in Frye&#x27;s criticism, was first suggested to him by Giambattista Vico.

===Frye&#x27;s critical method===
Frye uses the terms &#x27;centripetal&#x27; and &#x27;centrifugal&#x27; to describe his critical method. Criticism, Frye explains, is essentially centripetal when it moves inwardly, towards the structure of a text; it is centrifugal when it moves outwardly, away from the text and towards society and the outer world. Lyric poetry, for instance, like Keats&#x27;s &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;, is predominantly centripetal, stressing the sound and movement and imagery of the ordered words. Rhetorical novels, like &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, are predominantly centrifugal, stressing the thematic connection of the stories and characters to the social order. The &quot;Ode&quot; has centrifugal tendencies, relying for its effects on elements of history and pottery and visual aesthetics. &quot;Cabin&quot; has centripetal tendencies, relying on syntax and lexical choice to delineate characters and establish mood. But the one veers inward, the other pushes outward. Criticism reflects these movements, centripetally focusing on the aesthetic function of literature, centrifugally on the social function of literature.

While some critics or schools of criticism emphasize one movement over the other, for Frye, both movements are essential: &quot;criticism will always have two aspects, one turned toward the structure of literature and one turned toward the other cultural phenomena that form the social environment of literature&quot; (&quot;Critical Path&quot; 25). He would therefore agree, at least in part, with the New Critics of his day in their centripetal insistence on structural analysis. But for Frye this is only part of the story: &quot;It is right,&quot; he declares, &quot;that the first effort of critical apprehension should take the form of a rhetorical or structural analysis of a work of art. But a purely structural approach has the same limitation in criticism that it has in biology.&quot; That is, it doesn&#x27;t develop &quot;any explanation of how the structure came to be what it was and what its nearest relatives are. Structural analysis brings rhetoric back to criticism, but we need a new poetics as well . . .&quot; (&quot;Archetypes&quot; 1447).

===Archetypal criticism as &quot;a new poetics&quot;===

For Frye, this &quot;new poetics&quot; is to be found in the principle of the mythological framework, which has come to be known as &#x27;archetypal criticism&#x27;. It is through the lens of this framework, which is essentially a centrifugal movement of backing up from the text towards the archetype, that the social function of literary criticism becomes apparent. Essentially, &quot;what criticism can do,&quot; according to Frye, &quot;is awaken students to successive levels of awareness of the mythology that lies behind the ideology in which their society indoctrinates them&quot; (Stingle 5). That is, the study of recurring structural patterns grants students an emancipatory distance from their own society, and gives them a vision of a higher human state — the Longinian sublime — that is not accessible directly through their own experience, but ultimately transforms and expands their experience, so that the poetic model becomes a model to live by. In what he terms a &quot;kerygmatic mode,&quot; myths become &quot;myths to live by&quot; and metaphors &quot;metaphors to live in,&quot; which &quot;. . . not only work for us but constantly expand our horizons, [so that] we may enter the world of [kerygma or transformative power] and pass on to others what we have found to be true for ourselves&quot; (&quot;Double Vision&quot; 18).

Because of its important social function, Frye felt that literary criticism was an essential part of a liberal education, and worked tirelessly to communicate his ideas to a wider audience. &quot;For many years now,&quot; he wrote in 1987, &quot;I have been addressing myself primarily, not to other critics, but to students and a nonspecialist public, realizing that whatever new directions can come to my discipline will come from their needs and their intense if unfocused vision&quot; (&quot;Auguries&quot; 7). It is therefore fitting that his last book, published posthumously, should be one that he describes as being &quot;something of a shorter and more accessible version of the longer books, &quot;The Great Code&quot; and &quot;Words with Power&quot;,&quot; which he asks his readers to read sympathetically, not &quot;as proceeding from a judgment seat of final conviction, but from a rest stop on a pilgrimage, however near the pilgrimage may now be to its close&quot; (&quot;Double Vision&quot; Preface).

===Influences: Vico and Blake===
Vico, in &quot;The New Science&quot;, posited a view of language as fundamentally figurative, and introduced into Enlightenment discourse the notion of the role of the imagination in creating meaning. For Vico, poetic discourse is prior to philosophical discourse; philosophy is in fact derivative of poetry. Frye readily acknowledged the debt he owed to Vico in developing his literary theory, describing him as &quot;the first modern thinker to understand that all major verbal structures have descended historically from poetic and mythological ones&quot; (&quot;Words with Power&quot; xii).

However, it was Blake, Frye&#x27;s &quot;Virgilian guide&quot; (Stingle 1), who first awakened Frye to the &quot;mythological frame of our culture&quot; (Cotrupi 14). In fact, Frye claims that his &quot;second book [&quot;Anatomy&quot;] was contained in embryo in the first [&quot;Fearful Symmetry&quot;]&quot; (&quot;Stubborn Structure&quot; 160). For it was in reflecting on the similarity between Blake and Milton that Frye first stumbled upon the &quot;principle of the mythological framework,&quot; the recognition that &quot;the Bible was a mythological framework, cosmos or body of stories, and that societies live within a mythology&quot; (Hart 18). Blake thus led Frye to the conviction that the Bible provided Western societies with the mythology which informed all of Western literature. As Hamilton asserts, &quot;Blake&#x27;s claim that &#x27;the Old and New Testaments are the Great Code of Art&#x27; became the central doctrine of all [Frye&#x27;s] criticism&quot; (39). This &#x27;doctrine&#x27; found its fullest expression in Frye&#x27;s appropriately named &quot;The Great Code&quot;, which he described as &quot;a preliminary investigation of Biblical structure and typology&quot; whose purpose was ultimately to suggest &quot;how the structure of the Bible, as revealed by its narrative and imagery, was related to the conventions and genres of Western literature&quot; (&quot;Words with Power&quot; xi).

===Contribution to the theorizing of Canada===
During the 1950s, Frye wrote annual surveys of Canadian poetry for the &quot;University of Toronto Quarterly&quot;, which led him to observe recurrent themes and preoccupations in Canadian poetry. Subsequently, Frye elaborated on these observations, especially in his conclusion to Carl F. Klinck&#x27;s &quot;Literary History of Canada&quot; (1965). In this work, Frye presented the idea of the &quot;garrison mentality&quot; as the attitude from which Canadian literature has been written. The garrison mentality is the attitude of a member of a community that feels isolated from cultural centres and besieged by a hostile landscape. Frye maintained that such communities were peculiarly Canadian, and fostered a literature that was formally immature, that displayed deep moral discomfort with &quot;uncivilized&quot; nature, and whose narratives reinforced social norms and values.

Frye also aided James Polk in compiling &quot;Divisions on a Ground: Essays on Canadian Culture&quot; (1982). In the posthumous &quot;Collected Works of Northrop Frye&quot;, his writings on Canada occupy the thick 12th volume.

Garrison mentality

Frye collected his disparate writings on Canadian writing and painting in &quot;The Bush Garden: Essays on the Canadian Imagination&quot; (1971). He coined phrases like &quot;the Garrison Mentality&quot;, a theme that summarizes Canadian literature. Margaret Atwood adopted his approach and elaborated on this in her book &quot;&quot; (1972).

Canadian identity in literature

Based on his observations of Canadian literature, Frye concluded that, by extension, Canadian identity was defined by a fear of nature, by the history of settlement and by unquestioned adherence to the community. However, Frye perceived the ability and advisability of Canadian (literary) identity to move beyond these characteristics. Frye proposed the possibility of movement beyond the literary constraints of the garrison mentality: growing urbanization, interpreted as greater control over the environment, would produce a society with sufficient confidence for its writers to compose more formally advanced detached literature.

==== Study of literary productions ====
Frye&#x27;s international reputation allowed him to champion Canadian literature at a time when to do so was considered provincial. Frye argued that regardless of the formal quality of the writing, it was imperative to study Canadian literary productions in order to understand the Canadian imagination and its reaction to the Canadian environment.

==Awards and honours==

Frye was elected to the Royal Society of Canada in 1951 and awarded the Royal Society&#x27;s Lorne Pierce Medal (1958) and its Pierre Chauveau Medal (1970). He was named University Professor by the University of Toronto in 1967. He won the Canada Council Molson Prize in 1971, and the Royal Bank Award in 1978. In 1987 he received the Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award and the Toronto Arts Lifetime Achievement Award. He was an Honorary Fellow or Member of the following:
* American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1969)
* Merton College, Oxford (1974)
* British Academy (1975)
* American Philosophical Society (1976), and
* American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters (1981).

Northrop Frye was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1972. In 2000, he was honoured by the government of Canada with his image on a postage stamp. An international literary festival The Frye Festival, named in Frye&#x27;s honour, takes place every April in Moncton, New Brunswick.

The Northrop Frye Centre, part of Victoria College at the University of Toronto, was named in his honour, as was the Humanities Stream of the &quot;Vic One&quot; Program at Victoria College and the Northrop Frye Centre for Comparative Literature at the University of Toronto.

<text>Arthur Clokey (born Arthur Charles Farrington; October 12, 1921 – January 8, 2010) was an American animator, director, producer, screenwriter and voice actor, he was pioneer in the popularization of stop-motion clay animation, best known as the creator of the character Gumby and the original voice of Gumby&#x27;s sidekick, Pokey. Clokey&#x27;s career began in 1953 with a film experiment called &quot;Gumbasia&quot;, which was influenced by his professor, Slavko Vorkapich, at the University of Southern California. Clokey and his wife Ruth subsequently came up with the clay character Gumby and his horse Pokey, who first appeared in the &quot;Howdy Doody Show&quot; and later got their own series &quot;The Adventures of Gumby&quot;, from which they became a familiar presence on American television. The characters enjoyed a renewal of interest in the 1980s when American actor and comedian Eddie Murphy parodied Gumby in a skit on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

Clokey&#x27;s second-most famous production is the duo of &quot;Davey and Goliath&quot;, funded by the Lutheran Church in America (now the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America).

Clokey founded the company Premavision (which has manufacturing subsidiary, Prema Toy Company) around his Gumby and Pokey franchise.

==Early life==
Arthur Charles Farrington was born in Detroit on October 12, 1921. After his parents&#x27; divorce when he was about 8, he lived with his father; when Arthur was 9, his father was killed in an automobile accident. Rejoining his mother in California, the boy was banished by her new husband and placed in a children’s home. At about 11, young Arthur was adopted by Joseph Waddell Clokey, a well-known composer of sacred and secular music.

At Webb School in Claremont, young Clokey came under the influence of teacher Ray Alf, who took students on expeditions digging for fossils and learning about the world around them. Clokey later studied geology at Pomona College, where his new father Joseph was an organist, before leaving in 1943 to join the Air Corps as a reconnaissance photographer during World War II. He graduated from his father&#x27;s alma mater, Miami University, in 1948.

==Clay animation==
Art Clokey also made a few highly experimental and visually inventive short clay animation films for adults, including his first student film &quot;Gumbasia&quot; (produced in 1953 and released in 1955), the visually rich &quot;Mandala&quot; (1977)—described by Clokey as a metaphor for evolving human consciousness—and the equally bizarre &quot;The Clay Peacock&quot; (1959), an elaboration on the animated NBC logo of the time. Consisting of animated clay shapes contorting to a jazz score, &quot;Gumbasia&quot; so intrigued Samuel G. Engel, then president of the Motion Pictures Producers Association, that he financed the pilot film for what became Clokey&#x27;s &quot;The Gumby Show&quot; (1957). The title &quot;Gumbasia&quot; was in homage to Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot;.

In 1987, Clokey provided the voice for the figure Pokey in Arnold Leibovit&#x27;s film &quot;The Puppetoon Movie&quot;, and voiced him thereafter.

The Clokeys are credited with the clay-animation title sequences for the 1965 beach movies &quot;Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine&quot; and &quot;How to Stuff a Wild Bikini&quot;. His son, Joe Clokey, continued the &quot;Davey and Goliath&quot; cartoon in 2004. In March 2007, KQED-TV broadcast the hour-long documentary &quot;Gumby Dharma&quot; as part of their &quot;Truly CA&quot; series.

In 1995, Clokey directed and co-wrote (with his second wife, Gloria) &quot;&quot;, a feature film. The movie was not a success at the box office and was widely panned by critics, although it saw modest success on home media, going on to sell more than a million copies on home media, cementing itself as a cult classic.

==Death and legacy==
Clokey died in his sleep on January 8, 2010, at age 88, at his home in Los Osos, California, after suffering recurrent bladder infections.

On October 13, 2011, a day after what would have been Clokey&#x27;s 90th birthday, Google paid homage to his life and works with an interactive logo doodle in the style of his clay animations, including Gumby, produced by Premavision Studios.

<text>Adlai Ewing Stevenson (October 23, 1835 – June 14, 1914) was an American politician and diplomat who served as the 23rd vice president of the United States from 1893 to 1897 under President Grover Cleveland. A member of the Democratic Party, Stevenson served as a U.S. Representative for Illinois in the late 1870s and early 1880s. He was the founder of the Stevenson political family.

Appointment assistant postmaster general of the United States in 1885, during Cleveland&#x27;s first administration, Stevenson fired many Republican postal workers and replaced them with Southern Democrats. This earned him the enmity of the Republican-controlled Congress, but made him a favorite as Cleveland&#x27;s running mate in 1892, and he was elected vice president of the United States. During his term of office, Stevenson supported the free-silver lobby against the gold-standard men like Cleveland, but was praised for governing in a dignified, non-partisan manner.

In 1900, he ran for vice president with William Jennings Bryan. He was the paternal grandfather of Adlai Stevenson II, a governor of Illinois and the unsuccessful Democratic presidential nominee in both 1952 and 1956.

==Ancestry==
Adlai Ewing Stevenson was born in Christian County, Kentucky, on October 23, 1835, to John Turner and Eliza Ann Ewing Stevenson, Wesleyans of Scots-Irish descent. The Stevenson family is first recorded (as the Stephensons) in Roxburghshire, Scotland, in the early 18th century. The family appears to have had some wealth, as a private chapel in the Archdiocese of St Andrews bears their name. At some point, probably shortly after the Jacobite rising of 1715, the family migrated to County Antrim, Ireland, near Belfast. At least one Stephenson was a police officer. Adlai&#x27;s great-grandfather William Stephenson was a tailor who specialized in millinery. After William&#x27;s father died in the 1730s, his family moved to Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. William joined when his apprenticeship was completed in 1748.

In 1762, the family moved to North Carolina in what is now Iredell County. Including lands given to his children, William Stephenson (Stevenson after the American Revolution) had amassed of land by the time of his death. One branch of the family, including Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s father, then moved to Kentucky in 1813.

==Early life==
Stevenson was born on the family farm in Christian County. He attended Blue Water School in what is now Herndon, Kentucky. His childhood playmates included James A. McKenzie, a future representative for Kentucky, and Amanda Barkley, the grandmother of future Vice President Alben W. Barkley. In 1850, when he was 14, frost killed the family&#x27;s tobacco crop. Two years later, his father set free their few slaves and the family moved to Bloomington, Illinois, where his father then operated a sawmill. Stevenson attended Illinois Wesleyan University at Bloomington and ultimately graduated from Centre College, in Danville, Kentucky; at the latter he was a part of Phi Delta Theta. His father&#x27;s death prompted Stevenson to return from Kentucky to Illinois to run the sawmill.

Stevenson studied law with Bloomington attorney Robert E. Williams. He was admitted to the bar in 1858, and commenced practice in Metamora. As a young lawyer, Stevenson encountered such celebrated Illinois attorneys as Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln, and he campaigned for Douglas in his 1858 Senate race against Lincoln. Stevenson&#x27;s dislike of Lincoln might have been prompted by a contentious meeting between the two, at which Lincoln made several witty quips disparaging Stevenson. Stevenson also made speeches against the &quot;Know-Nothing&quot; movement, a nativist group opposed to immigrants and Catholics. That stand helped cement his support in Illinois&#x27; large German and Irish communities. In a predominantly Republican area, the Democratic Stevenson won friends through his storytelling and his warm and engaging personality.

==Marriage and political life, 1859–1884==
Stevenson was state&#x27;s attorney of Woodford County beginning in 1859. During the American Civil War, he was appointed a master in chancery (an aide in a court of equity). In 1864 Stevenson was a presidential elector for the Democratic ticket.

In 1866, he married Letitia Green. They had three daughters, Mary, Julia and Letitia, and a son, Lewis Stevenson. Letitia helped establish the Daughters of the American Revolution as a way of healing the divisions between the North and South after the Civil War, and succeeded the wife of Benjamin Harrison as the DAR&#x27;s second president-general.

In 1869, at the end of his term as state&#x27;s attorney, he entered law practice with his cousin, James Stevenson Ewing, moving with his wife back to Bloomington, Illinois, and settling in a large house on Franklin Square. Stevenson &amp; Ewing would become one of the state&#x27;s most prominent law firms. Ewing would later become the U.S. ambassador to Belgium.

The Democratic Party nominated Stevenson for the United States Congress in 1874. Stevenson was well-liked by Republicans and levied influence in the local Masonic lodge. Stevenson also received the nomination of the Independent Reform Party, a state party that fought monopolies following the Panic of 1873. Stevenson campaigned against Republican incumbent John McNulta. He attacked McNulta&#x27;s support for high tariffs and what became known as the Salary Grab Act, where congressmen increased their salaries by 50%. He spoke little of his own positions other than railroad regulation. McNulta attacked back, accusing Stevenson of membership in the Knights of the Golden Circle. Thanks to the votes siphoned away from the Republican Base by the Independent Reform Party, Stevenson won the election with 52% of the vote, though he did not carry his hometown of Bloomington. He was elevated to the 44th United States Congress, the first under Democratic control since the Civil War.

In 1876, Stevenson was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection. The Republican presidential ticket, headed by Rutherford B. Hayes, carried his district, and Stevenson was narrowly defeated, getting 49.6 percent of the vote. In 1878, he ran on both the Democratic and Greenback tickets and won, returning to a House from which one-third of his earlier colleagues had either voluntarily retired or been removed by the voters. In 1880, again a presidential election year, he once more lost narrowly, and he lost again in 1882 in his final race for Congress. He considered a run in 1884, but a redistricting made his district safely Republican.

In between legislative sessions, Stevenson increased his prominence in Bloomington. He rose to become grandmaster of his Masonic chapter and founded the &quot;Bloomington Daily Bulletin&quot; in 1881, a Democratic newspaper that sought to challenge the Republican &quot;Pantagraph&quot;. Stevenson directed the People&#x27;s Bank and co-managed the McLean County Coal Company with his brothers. The company founded Stevensonville, a company town near the mine shafts. Employees were purportedly fired if they did not support Stevenson in an election year.

==Election of Grover Cleveland in 1884 and the U.S. Post Office==
The Stevensons vacationed at lake resorts in Wisconsin during summers. There, Stevenson befriended William Freeman Vilas, a growing voice among Midwest Democrats and a friend of Grover Cleveland. Stevenson was a delegate to the 1884 Democratic National Convention, and after briefly supporting a local candidate, he threw his support behind Cleveland. Vilas and Stevenson personally informed Cleveland of the nomination. When Cleveland was elected that November, Vilas was named postmaster general. Although a different supporter was initially named assistant postmaster general, Stevenson received the position after the first choice fell ill.

The new position put Stevenson in charge of the largest patronage system in the country. Like his predecessors, Stevenson removed tens of thousands of political opponents from postal positions and replaced them with Democrats. Just before Cleveland left office, he nominated Stevenson for the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia judgeship left vacant by the death of William Matthews Merrick. Republicans controlled the U.S. Senate and refused to act, exacting a measure of revenge on Stevenson for replacing Republican postmasters while also secure in the knowledge that they would be able to confirm a Republican nominee after Benjamin Harrison was inaugurated. A disappointed Stevenson returned to Bloomington at the conclusion of Cleveland&#x27;s term.

==Vice presidency (1893–1897)==

Cleveland was renominated for president on the first ballot at the 1892 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. At the time, the vice presidency was considered a &quot;final resting place for has-beens and never-wases.&quot; Nonetheless, Stevenson&#x27;s brothers and cousins advocated for his nomination for the position. Likewise, Carter Harrison III (the mayor of Chicago) threw his support behind Stevenson as a native son, believing that he could influence the state to vote Democratic. Stevenson was nominated on the first ballot.

Stevenson backed off his former support of greenbacks in favor of Cleveland&#x27;s gold standard policy. Unlike Cleveland, who only appeared once in public to support his candidacy, Stevenson traveled with his wife across the country. Cleveland&#x27;s advisers sent Stevenson to the South to curb the growing appeal of the Populist Party. With his Kentucky roots, Stevenson proved popular at his Southern engagements. Stevenson also publicly opposed the Lodge Bill, a proposed bill which would have enfranchised Southern blacks. The winning Cleveland-Stevenson ticket carried Illinois, although not Stevenson&#x27;s home district.
Civil service reformers held out hope for the second Cleveland administration but saw Vice President Stevenson as a symbol of the spoils system. He never hesitated to feed names of Democrats to the Post Office Department. Once he called at the US Treasury Department to protest against an appointment and was shown a letter he had written endorsing the candidate. Stevenson told the treasury officials not to pay attention to any of his written endorsements; if he really favored someone he would tell them personally.

A habitual cigar-smoker, Cleveland developed oral cancer requiring immediate surgery in the summer of 1893. The president insisted the surgery be kept secret to avoid another panic on Wall Street. While on a yacht in New York Harbor that summer, Cleveland had part of his upper jaw removed and replaced with an artificial device in an operation that left no outward scar. The cancer surgery remained secret for another quarter century. Cleveland&#x27;s aides explained that he had merely had dental work. His vice president little realized how close he came to the presidency that summer.

Adlai Stevenson enjoyed his role as vice president, presiding over the U.S. Senate, &quot;the most august legislative assembly known to men.&quot; He won praise for ruling in a dignified, nonpartisan manner. In personal appearance he stood six feet tall and was &quot;of fine personal bearing and uniformly courteous to all.&quot; Although he was often a guest at the White House, Stevenson admitted that he was less an adviser to the president than &quot;the neighbor to his counsels.&quot; He credited the President with being &quot;courteous at all times&quot; but noted that &quot;no guards were necessary to the preservation of his dignity. No one would have thought of undue familiarity.&quot; For his part, President Cleveland snorted that the Vice President had surrounded himself with a coterie of free-silver men dubbed the &quot;Stevenson cabinet.&quot; The president even mused that the economy had gotten so bad and the Democratic Party so divided that &quot;the logical thing for me to do ... was to resign and hand the Executive branch to Mr. Stevenson,&quot; joking that he would try to get his friends jobs in Stevenson&#x27;s new cabinet.

==Post-vice presidency (1897–1914)==

===Presidential campaigns of 1896 and 1900===
Stevenson was mentioned as a candidate to succeed Cleveland in 1896. Although he chaired the Illinois delegation to the Democratic National Convention, he gained little support. Stevenson, 60 years old, received a smattering of votes, but the convention was taken by storm by a 36-year-old former representative from Nebraska, William Jennings Bryan, who delivered his fiery &quot;Cross of Gold&quot; speech in favor of a free silver plank in the platform. Not only did the Democrats repudiate Cleveland by embracing free silver, but they also nominated Bryan for president. Many Cleveland Democrats, including most Democratic newspapers, refused to support Bryan, but Vice President Stevenson loyally endorsed the ticket.

After the 1896 election, Bryan remained the titular leader of the Democrats and frontrunner for the nomination in 1900. Much of the newspaper speculation about who would run as the party&#x27;s vice-presidential candidate centered on Indiana Senator Benjamin Shively. When reporter Arthur Wallace Dunn interviewed Shively at the convention, the senator said he &quot;did not want the glory of a defeat as a vice presidential candidate.&quot; Disappointed, Dunn said that he still had to file a story on the vice-presidential nomination, and then added: &quot;I believe I&#x27;ll write a piece about old Uncle Adlai.&quot; Shively responded:

For the rest of the day, Dunn heard other favorable remarks about Stevenson, and by that night the former vice president was the leading contender, since no one else was &quot;very anxious to be the tail of what they considered was a forlorn hope ticket.&quot;

The Populists had already nominated the ticket of Bryan and Charles A. Towne, a pro-silver Republican from Minnesota, with the tacit understanding that Towne would step aside if the Democrats nominated someone else. Bryan preferred his good friend Towne, but Democrats wanted one of their own, and the regular element of the party felt comfortable with Stevenson. Towne withdrew and campaigned for Bryan and Stevenson. As a result, Stevenson, who had run with Cleveland in 1892, now ran in 1900 with Cleveland&#x27;s opponent Bryan. Twenty-five years senior to Bryan, Stevenson added age and experience to the ticket. Nevertheless, their effort failed badly against the Republican ticket of incumbent president William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.

Stevenson was the third U.S. vice president to win nomination for the office with a different running mate. He was seeking to follow George Clinton who served in Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s second term and James Madison&#x27;s first as well as John C. Calhoun who served under John Quincy Adams and then in Andrew Jackson&#x27;s first term. As of 2023, Republican Charles W. Fairbanks&#x27; failure to win a second vice-presidential term in 1916 is the only example since.

===Final years===
By May 1899, the North American Trust Company had directors such as John G. Carlisle, Adlai E. Stevenson and Wager Swayne.

After the 1900 election, Stevenson returned again to private practice in Illinois. He made one last attempt at office in a race for governor of Illinois in 1908, at age 73, losing narrowly. In 1909 he was brought in by founder Jesse Grant Chapline to aid distance learning school La Salle Extension University. After that, he retired to Bloomington, where his Republican neighbors described him as &quot;windy but amusing.&quot;

Stevenson&#x27;s wife Letitia died on December 25, 1913. William Jennings Bryan sent a letter of condolence to Stevenson. After this, Stevenson was emotionally broken, and only lived six more months. He died in Chicago, on June 14, 1914, aged 78. His body is interred in a family plot in Evergreen Cemetery, Bloomington, Illinois.

==Legacy==

Stevenson was the founder and Patriarch of the Stevenson political family, which has been called &quot;Illinois&#x27;s longest-lasting political dynasty–the only one to span four generations&quot;. Stevenson&#x27;s son, Lewis G. Stevenson, was Illinois secretary of state (1914–1917). Stevenson&#x27;s grandson Adlai Ewing Stevenson II was the Democratic nominee for president of the United States in 1952 and 1956 and governor of Illinois (1949–1953). Great-grandson Adlai Ewing Stevenson III was a U.S. senator from Illinois from 1970 to 1981 and an unsuccessful candidate for governor of Illinois in 1982 and 1986. He was also a contender for the 1976 Democratic vice presidential nomination.

There is a bust of Stevenson in the United States Capitol building as part of the United States Senate Vice Presidential Bust Collection. It was sculpted in 1894 by Franklin Simmons. Reportedly, Stevenson never sat to model for it, and Simmons only used photographs of Stevenson for likeness. The bust originally sat on a gallery-level niche in the Senate chamber, but in 1910 the bust collection was reorganized, and Stevenson&#x27;s bust was placed in the main Senate corridor. In 1991 it was moved to the opposite end of the corridor, which required moving the bust of Vice President Charles W. Fairbanks. Stevenson&#x27;s bust was moved that time to make room for the incoming bust of then-president and former vice president George H. W. Bush.

In 1962, Stevenson&#x27;s alma mater, Centre College, named a newly built residence hall &quot;Stevenson House&quot; in his honor. They had previously awarded him an honorary degree in 1893. 

Stevenson&#x27;s home in Metamora, Illinois is now a museum. It was the family residence from 1859 to 1869.

<doc id="92200" wikidata="Q258403" url="?curid=92200" title="Utterance">
<text>In spoken language analysis, an utterance is a continuous piece of speech, by one person, before or after which there is silence on the part of the person. In the case of spoken languages, it is generally, but not always, bounded by silence. Utterances do not exist in written language; only their representations do. They can be represented and delineated in written language in many ways.

In spoken language, utterances have several characteristics such as paralinguistic features, which are aspects of speech such as facial expression, gesture, and posture. Prosodic features include stress, intonation, and tone of voice, as well as ellipsis, which are words that the listener inserts in spoken language to fill gaps. Moreover, other aspects of utterances found in spoken languages are non-fluency features including: voiced/un-voiced pauses (i.e. &quot;umm&quot;), tag questions, and false starts, or when someone begins uttering again to correct themselves. Other features include fillers (i.e. &quot;and stuff&quot;), accent/dialect, deictic expressions (utterances such as &quot;over there!&quot; that need further explanation to be understood), simple conjunctions (&quot;and&quot;, &quot;but&quot;, etc.), and colloquial lexis (everyday informal words).

Utterances that are portrayed in writing are planned, unlike utterances in improvised spoken language. In written language there are frameworks that are used to portray this type of language. Discourse structure (which can also be found in spoken language) is how the conversation is organized, in which adjacency pairs - an utterance and the answer to that utterance - are used. Discourse markers are used to organize conversation (&quot;first&quot;, &quot;secondly&quot;, etc.). Lexis denotes the words being used in a text or spoken; these words can create a semantic field. For example, a semantic field of love can be created with lexical choices such as adore, admire, and care.

== Characteristics ==
An utterance found in spoken or written language, as in a script, has several characteristics. These include paralinguistic features which are forms of communication that do not involve words but are added around an utterance to give meaning. Examples of paralinguistic features include facial expressions, laughter, eye contact, and gestures. Prosodic features refer to the sound of someone&#x27;s voice as they speak: pitch, intonation and stress. Ellipsis can be used in either written or spoken language; for instance, when an utterance is conveyed and the speaker omits words because they are already understood in the situation. For example: A: Juice? B: Please. A: Room temperature? B: Cold.

Non-fluency features also occur when producing utterances. As people think about what to say during conversations, there are errors and corrections in speech. For example, voiced/un-voiced pauses which are &quot;umm&quot;, &quot;erm&quot;, etc. in voiced pauses and in transcripts un-voiced pauses are denoted as (.) or (1) relating to the amount of time of the pause. Tag questions are also a part of non-fluency features; these are used by the speaker to check if the listener understands what the speaker is saying. An example is &quot;Do you know what I mean?&quot; False alerts occur when the speaker is voicing an utterance but stops and starts again, usually to correct themselves.

Fillers usually give the speaker time to think and gather their thoughts in order to continue their utterance; these include lexis such as, &quot;like&quot;, &quot;and stuff&quot;, Accent/dialect is also a characteristic included in utterances which is the way the words are voiced, the pronunciation and the different types of lexis used in different parts of the world. Deictic expressions are utterances that need more explanation in order to be understood, like: &quot;Wow! Look over there!&quot; Simple conjunctions in speech are words that connect other words like &quot;and&quot;, &quot;but&quot;, etc. Colloquial lexis is a type of speech that is casual in which the utterance is usually more relaxed.

== Child-directed speech ==
The development of utterances in children is facilitated by parents, adults, or any other guardian the child has growing up. Studies have indicated that this development is affected by the parent, adult, or guardian&#x27;s socioeconomic status (SES). It has been shown that children whose parents received more education and have higher SES have larger vocabularies and learn new words more quickly during early childhood while children with less educated parents and lower SES have a smaller vocabulary and a slower growth in their vocabulary skills (Arriaga, Fenson, Cronan &amp; Pethick, 1998; Hart &amp; Risley, 1995; Hoff, Laursen &amp; Tardif, 2002; Hoff-Ginsberg, 1991; Lawrence &amp; Shipley, 1996; Ninio, 1980). This correlation is due to the fact that more educated parents use more lexises when speaking to their children as opposed to parents who are less educated (Hart &amp; Risley, 1995; Hoff, 2003 a; Huttenlocher, Vasilyeva, Waterfall, Vevea &amp; Hedges, in press). Hoff&#x27;s 2003 analysis supports this correlation and shows that the mean length of utterance and vocabulary of mothers who talk to their children is related to their SES status and thus child vocabulary development. For instance, high-SES mothers use longer utterances and a wider variety of words when talking to their children. These mothers also spend more time talking to their children while low-SES mothers use shorter utterances and a smaller vocabulary. As a result, children with parents who are more educated have larger vocabularies (Hoff, 2003).

In child-directed speech, utterances have several additional features. For example, the phonology in child-directed speech is different: Utterances are spoken more slowly, with longer pauses in between utterances, higher pitches, etc. The lexis and semantics differ, and a speaker uses words suited for children, &quot;doggie&quot; instead of &quot;dog&quot;, for example. The grammar is simpler, repetitive, with less use of verbs and adjectives. There is a greater use of one word utterances and the pragmatics uses supportive language like expansions and re-casting.

== Gricean maxims ==

Paul Grice (1989) came up with four maxims necessary in order to have a collegial conversation in which utterances are understood:

#Maxim of Quantity: provide the right amount of information needed for that conversation
#Maxim of Quality: provide information that is true
#Maxim of Relation: provide information that is relevant to the topic at hand
#Maxim of Manner: give order to your utterances throughout conversation, be clear

==Bakhtin&#x27;s theory of utterance==
According to philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin, there are four accepted properties that utterances should have:
* Boundaries – All utterances must be bounded by a &quot;change of speech subject&quot;. This usually means, as previously mentioned, that they are bounded by silence. 
* Responsivity or dialogicity – The utterance must be either responding/following a previous utterance or generating dialogue.
* Finalization – An utterance must have a clear ending, and only occurs if the speaker has said everything he or she wishes to say.
* Generic form – The choice of the speech genre is determined based on the specific circumstances and sphere in which the dialogue occurs.

Bakhtin also emphasizes that an utterance and a sentence are not the same thing. According to Bakhtin, sentences do not indicate a change of speech subject, and thus do not automatically satisfy one of the four properties of utterances. According to him, the sentence as a language unit is grammatical in nature, while an utterance is &quot;ethical&quot;.

<text>Charles Warren Fairbanks (May 11, 1852 – June 4, 1918) was an American politician who served as the 26th vice president of the United States under President Theodore Roosevelt from 1905 to 1909. A member of the Republican Party, Fairbanks was previously a senator from Indiana from 1897 to 1905.

Born in Unionville Center, Ohio, Fairbanks moved to Indianapolis after graduating from Ohio Wesleyan University. He became an attorney and railroad financier, working under railroad magnate Jay Gould. Fairbanks delivered the keynote address at the 1896 Republican National Convention and won election to the Senate the following year. In the Senate, he became an advisor to President William McKinley and served on a commission that helped settle the Alaska boundary dispute.

The 1904 Republican National Convention selected Fairbanks as the running mate for President Theodore Roosevelt. As vice president, Fairbanks worked against Roosevelt&#x27;s progressive policies. Fairbanks unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination at the 1908 Republican National Convention and backed William Howard Taft in 1912 against Roosevelt. Fairbanks sought the presidential nomination at the 1916 Republican National Convention, but was instead selected as the vice presidential nominee, with former Associate Justice and Governor Charles Evans Hughes, and would have been the third vice president to serve under different presidents (after George Clinton and John C. Calhoun), and the only one non-consecutively. The Hughes-Fairbanks ticket, however, narrowly lost to the Democratic ticket of President Woodrow Wilson and Vice President Thomas R. Marshall.

==Early life==
Fairbanks was born in a log cabin near Unionville Center, Ohio, the son of Mary Adelaide (Smith) and Loriston Monroe Fairbanks, a wagon-maker. Fairbanks in his youth saw his family&#x27;s home used as a hiding place for runaway slaves. After attending country schools and working on a farm, Fairbanks attended Ohio Wesleyan University, where he graduated in 1872. While there, Fairbanks was co-editor of the school newspaper with Cornelia Cole, whom he married after both graduated from the school.

==Early career==

Fairbanks&#x27;s first position was as an agent of the Associated Press in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, reporting on political rallies for Horace Greeley during the 1872 presidential election. He studied law in Pittsburgh before moving to Cleveland, Ohio, where he continued to work for the Associated Press while attending a semester at Cleveland Law School to complete his legal education. Fairbanks was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1874, and moved to Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1875 he received his Master of Arts degree from Ohio Wesleyan.

During his early years in Indiana, Fairbanks was paid $5,000 a year as manager for the bankrupt Indianapolis, Bloomington, and Western Railroad. With the assistance of his uncle, Charles W. Smith, whose connections had helped him obtain the position, Fairbanks was able to become a railroad financier and served as counsel for millionaire Jay Gould.

Prior to the 1888 Republican National Convention, federal judge Walter Q. Gresham sought Fairbanks&#x27;s help in campaigning for the Republican nomination for U.S. President. When Benjamin Harrison won the nomination, Fairbanks supported him and made campaign speeches on his behalf. Afterward, Fairbanks began to take an even greater interest in politics, and made campaign speeches on Harrison&#x27;s behalf again in the campaign of 1892. In 1893, Fairbanks was a candidate for the United States Senate, but Democrats controlled the state legislature and reelected incumbent Democrat David Turpie.

In 1894, Fairbanks was the most visible organizer and speaker on behalf of Republicans in elections for the state legislature. He was credited with delivering Republican majorities to both the Indiana House of Representatives and Indiana Senate, ensuring that a Republican would be elected to succeed Daniel W. Voorhees in the United States Senate at the end of Voorhees&#x27;s term in 1897. At the 1896 Republican National Convention, Fairbanks was both temporary chairman and keynote speaker, further raising his public profile. Fairbanks was the most likely Republican candidate for Voorhees&#x27;s seat, and in January 1897 Republican legislators formally chose him as their nominee. On January 19, 1897, Fairbanks was elected to the Senate, and he took his seat on March 4.

===U.S. Senator===
During his eight years in the U.S. Senate, Fairbanks served as a key advisor to McKinley during the Spanish–American War and was also the Chairman of the Committee on Immigration and the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds. In 1898, Fairbanks was appointed a member of the United States and British Joint High Commission which met in Quebec City &quot;for the adjustment of Canadian questions&quot;, including the Alaska boundary dispute.

==Vice presidency (1905–1909)==

Fairbanks was elected vice president of the United States in 1904 on the Republican ticket with Theodore Roosevelt and served a four-year term, 1905 to 1909. He became the first vice president to serve a complete term without casting any tie-breaking votes as President of the Senate. Fairbanks, a conservative whom Roosevelt had once labeled a &quot;reactionary machine politician&quot; (and who had been caricatured as a &quot;Wall Street Puppet&quot; during the campaign), actively worked against Roosevelt&#x27;s progressive &quot;Square Deal&quot; program. Roosevelt did not give Fairbanks a significant role in his administration, and (having chosen not to seek reelection) strongly promoted William Howard Taft as his potential successor in 1908. Fairbanks also sought the Republican nomination for president, but was unsuccessful and returned to the practice of law. In 1912, Fairbanks supported Taft&#x27;s reelection against Roosevelt&#x27;s Bull Moose candidacy.

==Post-vice presidency (1909–1918)==

===Hughes&#x27;s running mate===
In 1916, Fairbanks was in charge of establishing the platform for the Republican party. He sought that year&#x27;s Republican presidential nomination at the party&#x27;s June convention. When Charles Evans Hughes was nominated, Fairbanks was selected by the convention as the vice presidential nominee, which would have returned him to office under a different president, a feat previously accomplished only by George Clinton and John C. Calhoun. In November, Hughes and Fairbanks lost a close election to the Democratic incumbents Woodrow Wilson and Thomas Marshall. Fairbanks and Adlai Stevenson (vice president from 1893 to 1897) share the distinction of seeking reelection to non-consecutive terms as vice president. Former vice president Stevenson ran for a second non-consecutive term with William Jennings Bryan in the 1900 election but he and Bryan lost to the Republican ticket of William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. After the election, Fairbanks resumed the practice of law in Indianapolis, but his health soon started to fail.

===Death and legacy===

Fairbanks died of nephritis in his home on June 4, 1918, at the age of 66, and he was interred in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis.

Fairbanks received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1901, and from Northwestern University in 1907. The Charles W. Fairbanks Professor of Politics and Government position at Ohio Wesleyan University is named for him.

The city of Fairbanks, Alaska, and the Fairbanks North Star Borough within which it lies; the Fairbanks School District in Union County, Ohio; Fairbanks, Minnesota; Fairbanks, Oregon; and Fairbanks Township, Michigan, are all named after him.

In 1966, the Indiana Sesquicentennial Commission placed an Indiana historical marker in front of Fairbanks&#x27;s home at 30th and Meridian Streets in Indianapolis. On May 15, 2009, an Ohio historical marker was dedicated in Unionville Center, commemorating Fairbanks&#x27;s birthplace.

<text>Maybelline New York (formerly The Maybelline Company and Mabelline and Co.), trading as and commonly known as simply Maybelline ( ), is an American multinational cosmetics, skin care, perfume, and personal care company, based in New York City. Founded in Chicago in 1914, it has been a subsidiary of French cosmetics company L&#x27;Oréal since 1996.

==History==

The Maybelline Company was founded in Chicago by pharmacist Thomas Lyle Williams in 1915. Williams noticed his older sister Mabel applying a mixture of Vaseline and coal dust to her eyelashes to give them a darker, fuller look. He adapted it with a chemistry set and produced a product sold locally called Lash-Brow-Ine.

Williams renamed his eye beautifier Maybelline in her honor. In 1917, the company produced Maybelline Cake Mascara, &quot;the first modern eye cosmetic for everyday use&quot;, and Ultra Lash, the first mass-market automatic, in the 1960s.

In 1967, the company was sold by Williams to Plough Inc. (now Schering-Plough) in Memphis, Tennessee. The cosmetic production facility was moved from Chicago to Memphis over one weekend. In 1975, the company moved to Little Rock, Arkansas. In 1990, Schering-Plough sold Maybelline to a New York investment firm, Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. Maybelline&#x27;s headquarters remained in Memphis until its acquisition by L&#x27;Oréal in 1996. Its headquarters was then moved to New York City in 1996 and its factory to Brooklyn in 2000.

==Spokesmodels==
Maybelline received a boost when the company hired Lynda Carter as the company&#x27;s beauty fashion coordinator after her television series ended; she also appeared in several of its television and print advertisements.

Josie Maran, Miranda Kerr, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Melina Kanakaredes, Zhang Ziyi, Siti Nurhaliza, Fasha Sandha, Sheetal Mallar, Julia Stegner, Jessica White and Kristin Davis have endorsed Maybelline products. The current faces of Maybelline are Adriana Lima, Christy Turlington, Charlotte Kemp Muhl, Emily DiDonato, Erin Wasson, Beatriz Shantal, Jourdan Dunn, Josephine Skriver, Marloes Horst, Gigi Hadid, ITZY, Liza Soberano, Urassaya Sperbund, Winnie Harlow, DJ Peggy Gou, Kiss of Life and Ten (singer) of NCT.

==Slogans==
In 1981, the company adopted &quot;Maybelline, Maybelline Ooh La La&quot; as its advertising slogan, which was used until 1991 when the tagline changed to &quot;Maybe she&#x27;s born with it, maybe it&#x27;s Maybelline&quot; (and in some commercials as simply &quot;...Maybe it&#x27;s Maybelline.&quot;). The latter slogan was found to be the most recognizable strapline of the past 150 years by CBS Outdoor.

==Criticism==
In 1989, L&#x27;Oréal ceased to use animal testing in finished products before launch and committed to developing alternative methods. According to a 2010 report, however, animal testing of products is required by law in some countries to sell cosmetics. In 2021, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) reported that Maybelline tested on animals.

==Collaborations==
In January 2019, Maybelline collaborated with the German fashion brand Puma for its limited edition collection that was marketed as Maybelline X Puma. It was claimed as the multi-tasking athleisure-inspired collection and consisted of five products. Adriana Lima was chosen as the ambassador for the collaboration.

In May 2021, Maybelline collaborated with Marvel to create a limited edition that connects Marvel&#x27;s most iconic characters with the brand&#x27;s top-selling hero products.

<text>A bunker is a defensive military fortification designed to protect people and valued materials from falling bombs, artillery, or other attacks. Bunkers are almost always underground, in contrast to blockhouses which are mostly above ground. They were used extensively in World War I, World War II, and the Cold War for weapons facilities, command and control centers, and storage facilities. Bunkers can also be used as protection from tornadoes.

Trench bunkers are small concrete structures, partly dug into the ground. Many artillery installations, especially for coastal artillery, have historically been protected by extensive bunker systems. Typical industrial bunkers include mining sites, food storage areas, dumps for materials, data storage, and sometimes living quarters. When a house is purpose-built with a bunker, the normal location is a reinforced below-ground bathroom with fiber-reinforced plastic shells. Bunkers deflect the blast wave from nearby explosions to prevent ear and internal injuries to people sheltering in the bunker. Nuclear bunkers must also cope with the underpressure that lasts for several seconds after the shock wave passes, and block radiation.

A bunker&#x27;s door must be at least as strong as the walls. In bunkers inhabited for prolonged periods, large amounts of ventilation or air conditioning must be provided. Bunkers can be destroyed with powerful explosives and bunker-busting warheads.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;bunker&quot; originates as a Scots word for &quot;bench, seat&quot; recorded 1758, alongside shortened &quot;bunk&quot; &quot;sleeping berth&quot;. The word possibly has a Scandinavian origin: Old Swedish &quot;bunke&quot; means &quot;boards used to protect the cargo of a ship&quot;.
In the 19th century the word came to describe a coal store in a house, or below decks in a ship. It was also used for a sand-filled depression installed on a golf course as a hazard.

In the First World War the belligerents built underground shelters, called dugouts in English, while the Germans used the term &quot;Bunker&quot;. By the Second World War the term came to be used by the Germans to describe permanent structures both large (blockhouses), and small (pillboxes), and bombproof shelters both above ground (as in &quot;Hochbunker&quot;) and below ground (such as the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;).
The military sense of the word was imported into English during World War II, at first in reference to specifically German dug-outs; according to the Oxford English Dictionary, the sense of &quot;military dug-out; a reinforced concrete shelter&quot; is first recorded on 13 October 1939, in &quot;A Nazi field gun hidden in a cemented &#x27;bunker&#x27; on the Western front&quot;. All the early references to its usage in the Oxford English Dictionary are to German fortifications. However, in the Far East the term was also applied to the earth and log positions built by the Japanese, the term appearing in a 1943 instruction manual issued by the British Indian Army and quickly gaining wide currency.
By 1947 the word was familiar enough in English that Hugh Trevor-Roper in &quot;The Last Days of Hitler&quot; was describing Hitler&#x27;s underground complex near the Reich Chancellery as &quot;Hitler&#x27;s own bunker&quot; without quotes around the word bunker.

==Types==
===Trench===
This type of bunker is a small concrete structure, partly dug into the ground, which is usually a part of a trench system. Such bunkers give the defending soldiers better protection than the open trench and also include top protection against aerial attack. They also provide shelter against the weather. Some bunkers may have partially open tops to allow weapons to be discharged with the muzzle pointing upwards (e.g., mortars and anti-aircraft weapons).

===Artillery===
Many artillery installations, especially for coastal artillery, have historically been protected by extensive bunker systems. These usually housed the crews serving the weapons, protected the ammunition against counter-battery fire, and in numerous examples also protected the guns themselves, though this was usually a trade-off reducing their fields of fire. Artillery bunkers are some of the largest individual pre-Cold War bunkers. The walls of the &#x27;Batterie Todt&#x27; gun installation in northern France were up to thick, and an underground bunker was constructed for the V-3 cannon.

===Industrial===
Typical industrial bunkers include mining sites, food storage areas, dumps for materials, data storage, and sometimes living quarters. They were built mainly by nations like Germany during World War II to protect important industries from aerial bombardment. Industrial bunkers are also built for control rooms of dangerous activities, such as tests of rocket engines or explosive experiments. They are also built in order to perform dangerous experiments in them or to store radioactive or explosive goods. Such bunkers also exist on non-military facilities.

===Personal===
When a house is purpose-built with a bunker, the normal location is a reinforced below-ground bathroom with large cabinets. One common design approach uses fibre-reinforced plastic shells. Compressive protection may be provided by inexpensive earth arching. The overburden is designed to shield from radiation. To prevent the shelter from floating to the surface in high groundwater, some designs have a skirt held down with the overburden. It may also serve the purpose of a safe room.

Large bunkers are often bought by super rich individuals in case of political instability, and usually store or access large amounts of energy for use. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;luxury bunkers,&quot; and their locations are often documented.

===Munitions storage===
Munitions storage bunkers are designed to securely store explosive ordnance and contain any internal explosions. The most common configuration for high explosives storage is the igloo shaped bunker. They are often built into a hillside in order to provide additional containment mass.

A specialized version of the munitions bunker called a Gravel Gertie is designed to contain radioactive debris from an explosive accident while assembling or disassembling nuclear warheads. They are installed at all facilities in the United States and United Kingdom which do warhead assembly and disassembly, the largest being the Pantex plant in Amarillo, Texas, which has 12 Gravel Gerties.

==Design==
===Blast protection===
Bunkers deflect the blast wave from nearby explosions to prevent ear and internal injuries to people sheltering in the bunker. While frame buildings collapse from as little as of overpressure, bunkers are regularly constructed to survive over . This substantially decreases the likelihood that a bomb (other than a bunker buster) can harm the structure.

The basic plan is to provide a structure that is very strong in physical compression. The most common purpose-built structure is a buried, steel reinforced concrete vault or arch. Most expedient blast shelters are civil engineering structures that contain large, buried tubes or pipes such as sewage or rapid transit tunnels. Improvised purpose-built blast shelters normally use earthen arches or vaults. To form these, a narrow, , flexible tent of thin wood is placed in a deep trench, and then covered with cloth or plastic, and then covered with of tamped earth.

A large ground shock can move the walls of a bunker several centimeters in a few milliseconds. Bunkers designed for large ground shocks must have sprung internal buildings to protect inhabitants from the walls and floors.

===Nuclear protection===
Nuclear bunkers must also cope with the underpressure that lasts for several seconds after the shock wave passes, and block radiation. Usually, these features are easy to provide. The overburden (soil) and structure provide substantial radiation shielding, and the negative pressure is usually only of the overpressure.

===General features===

The doors must be at least as strong as the walls. The usual design is now starting to incorporate vault doors. To reduce the weight, the door is normally constructed of steel, with a fitted steel lintel and frame. Very thick wood also serves and is more resistant to heat because it chars rather than melts. If the door is on the surface and will be exposed to the blast wave, the edge of the door is normally counter-sunk in the frame so that the blast wave or a reflection cannot lift the edge. A bunker should have two doors. Door shafts may double as ventilation shafts to reduce digging.

In bunkers inhabited for prolonged periods, large amounts of ventilation or air conditioning must be provided in order to prevent ill effects of heat. In bunkers designed for war-time use, manually operated ventilators must be provided because supplies of electricity or gas are unreliable. One of the most efficient manual ventilator designs is the Kearny Air Pump. Ventilation openings in a bunker must be protected by blast valves. A blast valve is closed by a shock wave, but otherwise remains open. One form of expedient blast valve is worn flat rubber tire treads nailed or bolted to frames strong enough to resist the maximum overpressure.

==Countermeasures==
Bunkers can be destroyed with powerful explosives and bunkerbusting warheads. The crew of a pillbox can be killed with flamethrowers. Complex, well-built and well-protected fortifications are often vulnerable to attacks on access points. If the exits to the surface can be closed off, those manning the facility can be trapped. The fortification can then be bypassed.

==Famous installations==
Famous bunkers include the post-World War I Maginot Line on the French eastern border and Czechoslovak border fortifications mainly on the northern Czech border facing Germany (but to lesser extent all around), Fort Eben-Emael in Belgium, Alpine Wall on the north of Italy, World War II Führerbunker and in Italy, industrial Marnate&#x27;s Bunker, the V-weapon installations in Germany (Mittelwerk) &amp; France (La Coupole, and the Blockhaus d&#x27;Éperlecques) and the Cold War installations in the United States (Cheyenne Mountain Complex, Site R, and The Greenbrier), United Kingdom (Burlington), Sweden (Boden Fortress) and Canada (Diefenbunker). In Switzerland, there is an unusually large number of bunkers because of a law requiring protective shelters to be constructed for all new buildings since 1963, as well as a number of bunkers built as part of its National Redoubt military defense plan. Some of Switzerland&#x27;s bunkers have since become tourist attractions housing hotels and museums such as Sasso San Gottardo Museum.

The Soviet Union maintained huge bunkers (one of the secondary uses of the very deeply dug Moscow Metro and Kyiv metro systems was as nuclear shelters). A number of facilities were constructed in China, such as Beijing&#x27;s Underground City and Underground Project 131 in Hubei; in Albania, Enver Hoxha dotted the country with hundreds of thousands of bunkers. In the United States, the Presidential Emergency Operations Center underneath the East Wing of the White House serves as a secure shelter and communications center for the President of the United States in case of an emergency.

<doc id="92206" wikidata="Q6731531" url="?curid=92206" title="Magnetic circular dichroism">
<text>Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) is the differential absorption of left and right circularly polarized (LCP and RCP) light, induced in a sample by a strong magnetic field oriented parallel to the direction of light propagation. MCD measurements can detect transitions which are too weak to be seen in conventional optical absorption spectra, and it can be used to distinguish between overlapping transitions. Paramagnetic systems are common analytes, as their near-degenerate magnetic sublevels provide strong MCD intensity that varies with both field strength and sample temperature. The MCD signal also provides insight into the symmetry of the electronic levels of the studied systems, such as metal ion sites.

==History==
It was first shown by Faraday that optical activity (the Faraday effect) could be induced in matter by a longitudinal magnetic field (a field in the direction of light propagation). The development of MCD really began in the 1930s when a quantum mechanical theory of MOR (magnetic optical rotatory dispersion) in regions outside absorption bands was formulated. The expansion of the theory to include MCD and MOR effects in the region of absorptions, which were referred to as &quot;anomalous dispersions&quot; was developed soon thereafter. There was, however, little effort made to refine MCD as a modern spectroscopic technique until the early 1960s. Since that time there have been numerous studies of MCD spectra for a very large variety of samples, including stable molecules in solutions, in isotropic solids, and in the gas phase, as well as unstable molecules entrapped in noble gas matrices. More recently, MCD has found useful application in the study of biologically important systems including metalloenzymes and proteins containing metal centers.

== Differences between CD and MCD ==
In natural optical activity, the difference between the LCP light and the RCP light is caused by the asymmetry of the molecules (i.e. chiral molecules). Because of the handedness of the molecule, the absorption of the LCP light would be different from the RCP light. However, in MCD in the presence of a magnetic field, LCP and RCP no longer interact equivalently with the absorbing medium. Thus, there is not the same direct relation between magnetic optical activity and molecular stereochemistry which would be expected, because it is found in natural optical activity. So, natural CD is much more rare than MCD which does not strictly require the target molecule to be chiral.

Although there is much overlap in the requirements and use of instruments, ordinary CD instruments are usually optimized for operation in the ultraviolet, approximately 170–300 nm, while MCD instruments are typically required to operate in the visible to near infrared, approximately 300–2000 nm. The physical processes that lead to MCD are substantively different from those of CD. However, like CD, it is dependent on the differential absorption of left and right hand circularly polarized light. MCD will only exist at a given wavelength if the studied sample has an optical absorption at that wavelength. This is distinctly different from the related phenomenon of optical rotatory dispersion (ORD), which can be observed at wavelengths far from any absorption band.

== Measurement ==
The MCD signal ΔA is derived via the absorption of the LCP and RCP light as
:formula_1

This signal is often presented as a function of wavelength λ, temperature T or magnetic field H. MCD spectrometers can simultaneously measure absorbance and ΔA along the same light path. This eliminates error introduced through multiple measurements or different instruments that previously occurred before this advent.
The MCD spectrometer example shown below begins with a light source that emits a monochromatic wave of light. This wave is passed through a Rochon prism linear polarizer, which separates the incident wave into two beams that are linearly polarized by 90 degrees. The two beams follow different paths- one beam (the extraordinary beam) traveling directly to a photomultiplier (PMT), and the other beam (the ordinary beam) passing through a photoelastic modulator (PEM) oriented at 45 degrees to the direction of the ordinary ray polarization. The PMT for the extraordinary beam detects the light intensity of the input beam. The PEM is adjusted to cause an alternating plus and minus 1/4 wavelength shift of one of the two orthogonal components of the ordinary beam. This modulation converts the linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light at the peaks of the modulation cycle. Linearly polarized light can be decomposed into two circular components with intensity represented as formula_2

The PEM will delay one component of linearly polarized light with a time dependence that advances the other component by 1/4 λ (hence, quarter-wave shift). The departing circularly polarized light oscillates between RCP and LCP in a sinusoidal time-dependence as depicted below:

The light finally travels through a magnet containing the sample, and the transmittance is recorded by another PMT. The schematic is given below:

The intensity of light from the ordinary wave that reaches the PMT is governed by the equation:

formula_3

Here A– and A+ are the absorbances of LCP or RCP, respectively; ω is the modulator frequency – usually a high acoustic frequency such as 50 kHz; &quot;t&quot; is time; and δ0 is the time-dependent wavelength shift.

This intensity of light passing through the sample is converted into a two-component voltage via a current/voltage amplifier. A DC voltage will emerge corresponding to the intensity of light passed through the sample. If there is a ΔA, then a small AC voltage will be present that corresponds to the modulation frequency, ω. This voltage is detected by the lock in amplifier, which receives its reference frequency, ω, directly from the PEM. From such voltage, ΔA and A can be derived using the following relations:

formula_4

formula_5

where Vex is the (DC) voltage measured by the PMT from the extraordinary wave, and Vdc is the DC component of the voltage measured by the PMT for the ordinary wave (measurement path not shown in the diagram).

Some superconducting magnets have a small sample chamber, far too small to contain the entire optical system. Instead, the magnet sample chamber has windows on two opposite sides. Light from the source enters one side, interacts with the sample (usually also temperature controlled) in the magnetic field, and exits through the opposite window to the detector. Optical relay systems that allow the source and detector each to be about a meter from the sample are typically employed. This arrangement avoids many of the difficulties that would be encountered if the optical apparatus had to operate in the high magnetic field, and also allows for a much less expensive magnet.

== Applications ==
MCD can be used as an optical technique for the detection of electronic structure of both the ground states and excited states. It is also a strong addition to the more commonly used absorption spectroscopy, and there are two reasons that explain this. First, a transition buried under a stronger transition can appear in MCD if the first derivative of the absorption is much larger for the weaker transition or it is of the opposite sign. Second, MCD will be found where no absorption is detected at all if ΔA &gt; (ΔAmin) but A &lt; Amin, where (ΔA)min and Amin are the minimum of ΔA and A that are detectable. Typically, (ΔAmin) and Amin are of the magnitudes around 10−5 and 10−3 respectively. So, a transition can only be detected in MCD, not in the absorption spectroscopy, if ΔA/A &gt; 10−2. This happens in paramagnetic systems that are at lower temperature or that have sharp lines in the spectroscopy.

In biology, metalloproteins are the most likely candidates for MCD measurements, as the presence of metals with degenerate energy levels leads to strong MCD signals. In the case of ferric heme proteins, MCD is capable of determining both oxidation and spin state to a remarkably exquisite degree. In regular proteins, MCD is capable of stoichiometrically measuring the tryptophan content of proteins, assuming there are no other competing absorbers in the spectroscopic system.
In addition, the application of MCD spectroscopy greatly improved the level of understanding in the ferrous non-heme systems because of the direct observation of the d–d transitions, which generally can not be obtained in optical absorption spectroscopy owing to the weak extinction coefficients and are often electron paramagnetic resonance silent due to relatively large ground-state sublevel splittings and fast relaxation times.

== Theory ==
Consider a system of localized, non-interacting absorbing centers. Based on the semi-classical radiation absorption theory within the electric dipole approximation, the electric vector of the circularly polarized waves propagates along the +z direction. In this system, formula_6 is the angular frequency, and formula_7 = n – ik is the complex refractive index. As the light travels, the attenuation of the beam is expressed as

:formula_8 

where formula_9 is the intensity of light at position formula_10, formula_11 is the absorption coefficient of the medium in the formula_10 direction, and formula_13 is the speed of light. Circular dichroism (CD) is then defined by the difference between left (formula_14) and right (formula_15) circularly polarized light, formula_16, following the sign convention of natural optical activity. In the presence of a static, uniform external magnetic field applied parallel to the direction of propagation of light, the Hamiltonian for the absorbing center takes the form formula_17 for formula_18 describing the system in the external magnetic field and formula_19 describing the applied electromagnetic radiation. The absorption coefficient for a transition between two eigenstates of formula_18, formula_21 and formula_22, can be described using the electric dipole transition operator formula_23 as 

:formula_24
:formula_25

The formula_26 term is a frequency-independent correction factor allowing for the effect of the medium on the light wave electric field, composed of the permittivity formula_27 and the real refractive index formula_28.

=== Discrete line spectrum ===
In cases of a discrete spectrum, the observed formula_29 at a particular frequency formula_30 can be treated as a sum of contributions from each transition, 

:formula_31 

where formula_32 is the contribution at formula_30 from the formula_34 transition, formula_35 is the absorption coefficient for the formula_34 transition, and formula_37 is a bandshape function (formula_38). Because eigenstates formula_21 and formula_22 depend on the applied external field, the value of formula_41 varies with field. It is frequently useful to compare this value to the absorption coefficient in the absence of an applied field, often denoted 

:formula_42 

When the Zeeman effect is small compared to zero-field state separations, line width, and formula_43 and when the line shape is independent of the applied external field formula_44, first-order perturbation theory can be applied to separate formula_29 into three contributing Faraday terms, called formula_46, formula_47, and formula_48. The subscript indicates the moment such that formula_46 contributes a derivative-shaped signal and formula_47 and formula_48 contribute regular absorptions. Additionally, a zero-field absorption term formula_52 is defined. The relationships between formula_29, formula_54, and these Faraday terms are 
:formula_55
:formula_56 
for external field strength formula_44, Boltzmann constant formula_58, temperature formula_59, and a proportionality constant formula_60. This expression requires assumptions that formula_22 is sufficiently high in energy that formula_62, and that the temperature of the sample is high enough that magnetic saturation does not produce nonlinear formula_63 term behavior. 
Though one must pay attention to proportionality constants, there is a proportionality between formula_29 and molar extinction coefficient formula_65 and absorbance formula_66 for concentration formula_67 and path length formula_68. 

These Faraday terms are the usual language in which MCD spectra are discussed. Their definitions from perturbation theory are 

:formula_69 
where formula_70 is the degeneracy of ground state formula_71, formula_72 labels states other than formula_71 or formula_74, formula_27 and formula_76 and formula_77 label the levels within states formula_71 and formula_74 and formula_72 (respectively), formula_81 is the energy of unperturbed state formula_82, formula_83 is the formula_10 angular momentum operator, formula_85 is the formula_10 spin operator, and formula_87 indicates the real part of the expression. 

===Origins of A, B, and C Faraday Terms===

The equations in the previous subsection reveal that the formula_46, formula_47, and formula_48 terms originate through three distinct mechanisms. 

The formula_46 term arises from Zeeman splitting of the ground or excited degenerate states. These field-dependent changes in energies of the magnetic sublevels causes small shifts in the bands to higher/lower energy. The slight offsets result in incomplete cancellation of the positive and negative features, giving a net derivative shape in the spectrum. This intensity mechanism is generally independent of sample temperature.

The formula_47 term is due to the field-induced mixing of states. Energetic proximity of a third state formula_93 to either the ground state formula_94 or excited state formula_95 gives appreciable Zeeman coupling in the presence of an applied external field. As the strength of the magnetic field increases, the amount of mixing increases to give growth of an absorption band shape. Like the formula_46 term, the formula_47 term is generally temperature independent. Temperature dependence of formula_47 term intensity can sometimes be observed when formula_93 is particularly low-lying in energy. 

The formula_48 term requires the degeneracy of the ground state, often encountered for paramagnetic samples. This happens due to a change in the Boltzmann population of the magnetic sublevels, which is dependent on the degree of field-induced splitting of the sublevel energies and on the sample temperature. Decrease of the temperature and increase of the magnetic field increases the formula_48 term intensity until it reaches the maximum (saturation limit). Experimentally, the formula_48 term spectrum can be obtained from MCD raw data by subtraction of MCD spectra measured in the same applied magnetic field at different temperatures, while formula_46 and formula_47 terms can be distinguished via their different band shapes.

The relative contributions of A, B and C terms to the MCD spectrum are proportional to the inverse line width, energy splitting, and temperature:
:formula_105
where formula_106 is line width and formula_107 is the zero-field state separation. For typical values of formula_106 = 1000 cm−1, formula_107 = 10,000 cm−1 and formula_43 = 6 cm−1 (at 10 K), the three terms make relative contributions 1:0.1:150. So, at low temperature the formula_48 term dominates over formula_46 and formula_47 for paramagnetic samples.

== Example on C terms ==

In the visible and near-ultraviolet regions, the hexacyanoferrate(III) ion (Fe(CN)63−) exhibits three strong absorptions at 24500, 32700, and 40500 cm−1, which have been ascribed to ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) transitions. They all have lower energy than the lowest-energy intense band for the Fe(II) complex Fe(CN)62− found at 46000 cm−1. The red shift with increasing oxidation state of the metal is characteristic of LMCT bands. Additionally, only A terms, which are temperature independent, should be involved in MCD structure for closed-shell species. 

These features can be explained as follows. The ground state of the anion is 2T2g, which derives from the electronic configuration (t2g)5. So, there would be an unpaired electron in the d orbital of Fe3+
From that, the three bands can be assigned to the transitions 2t2g→2t1u1, 2t2g →2t1u2, 2t2g →2t2u. Two of the excited states are of the same symmetry, and, based on the group theory, they could mix with each other so that there are no pure σ and π characters in the two t1u states, but for t2u, there would be no intermixing. The A terms are also possible from the degenerate excited states, but the studies of temperature dependence showed that the A terms are not as dependent as the C term.

An MCD study of Fe(CN)63− embedded in a thin polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film revealed a temperature dependence of the C term. The room-temperature C0/D0 values for the three bands in the Fe(CN)63− spectrum are 1.2, −0.6, and 0.6, respectively, and their signs (positive, negative, and positive) establish the energy ordering as 2t2g→2t1u2&lt;2t2g→2t2u&lt;2t2g→2t1u1

== Example on A and B terms ==
To have an A- and B-term in the MCD spectrum, a molecule must contain degenerate excited states (A-term) and excited states close enough in energy to allow mixing (B-term). One case exemplifying these conditions is a square planar, d8 complex such as [(n-C4H9)4N]2Pt(CN)4. In addition to containing A- and B-terms, this example demonstrates the effects of spin-orbit coupling in metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions. As shown in figure 1, the molecular orbital diagram of [(n-C4H9)4N]2Pt(CN)4 reveals MLCT into the antibonding π* orbitals of cyanide. The ground state is diamagnetic (thereby eliminating any C-terms) and the LUMO is the a2u. The dipole-allowed MLCT transitions are a1g-a2u and eg-a2u. Another transition, b2u-a2u, is a weak (orbitally forbidden singlet) but can still be observed in MCD.

Because A- and B-terms arise from the properties of states, all singlet and triplet excited states are given in figure 2.


Mixing of all these singlet and triplet states will occur and is attributed to the spin orbit coupling of platinum 5d orbitals (ζ ~ 3500 cm−1), as shown in figure 3. The black lines on the figure indicate the mixing of 1A2u with 3Eu to give two A2u states. The red lines show the 1Eu, 3Eu, 3A2u, and 3B1u states mixing to give four Eu states. The blue lines indicate remnant orbitals after spin-orbit coupling that are not a result of mixing.

<text>James Schoolcraft Sherman (October 24, 1855 – October 30, 1912) was the 27th vice president of the United States, serving from 1909 until his death in 1912, under President William Howard Taft. A member of the Republican Party, Sherman was previously a United States representative from New York from 1887 to 1891 and 1893 to 1909. He was a member of the interrelated Baldwin, Hoar, and Sherman families, prominent lawyers and politicians of New England and New York.

Although not a high-powered administrator, he made a natural congressional committee chairman, and his genial personality eased the workings of the House, so that he was known as &#x27;Sunny Jim&#x27;. He was the first vice president to fly in an airplane (1911), and also the first to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at a baseball game.

Sherman was the seventh and most recent vice president to have died in office.

== Early life ==
Sherman was born in Utica, New York, the son of Richard Updike Sherman and Mary Frances Sherman. According to Facts on File, &quot;Sherman was of the ninth generation of descendants from Henry Sherman, a line also connected to Roger Sherman, signer of the Declaration of Independence, and William Tecumseh Sherman, the Union general during the Civil War&quot;. He was educated at Whitestown Seminary, then attended Hamilton College, from which he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1878. At Hamilton, he was noted for his skills in oratory and debate.

After graduation, he remained at Hamilton for a year to study law, then continued his studies at the Utica office of Beardsley, Cookingham and Burdick, which included his brother in law Henry J. Cookingham as a partner. He was admitted to the bar in 1880, and practiced with Cookingham in the firm of Cookingham &amp; Martin. Sherman was also president of the Utica Trust &amp; Deposit Co. and the New Hartford Canning Company. Sherman became active in politics as a Republican and was elected chairman of the party in Oneida County. He became mayor of Utica at age twenty-nine. In 1881, he married Carrie Babcock of East Orange, New Jersey, and they had three sons; Sherrill B. Sherman, Richard Updyke Sherman, and Thomas Moore Sherman.

== Old-guard conservative in Congress ==

In 1886, Sherman was elected U.S. Representative from New York&#x27;s 23rd congressional district as a Republican, and he served 20 years in the House (four years, followed by a two-year break and 16 more years).
At a time when the Republican Party was divided over protective tariffs, Sherman sided with William McKinley and the conservative branch, defending the gold standard against the potentially inflationary &#x27;free silver&#x27;.

During his House career, Sherman served as chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs from the 54th through the 60th Congresses (1895 to 1909).

As Sherman had never held a party leadership post or been a chairman of a major committee such as Ways and Means or Appropriations, he was considered sufficiently neutral to frequently be appointed chairman of the Committee of the Whole— a crucial device for speeding up the passage of bills by suspending certain rules at the discretion of the chairman. Henry Cabot Lodge recognized this job as a major test of integrity and judgment, and declared that Sherman was supremely fitted for it. Through Sherman&#x27;s efforts in 1900, the Sherman Indian High School in Riverside, California was built and named after him.

== Vice presidency (1909–1912) ==

At the suggestion of Senator Charles Curtis at the 1908 Republican National Convention, Sherman was nominated as the Republican candidate for vice president on the ticket with William Howard Taft. Although not an obvious front-runner, he balanced the progressive Taft&#x27;s profile, by being both an Easterner and a conservative (it was said that the two wings of the GOP &#x27;flapped together&#x27;), and the New York delegates pressed hard for his nomination. The Republicans won by a comfortable margin. At first, Sherman and Taft found themselves at odds over both tariff policy and the role of the Vice President. But as Taft became embattled with parts of the progressive faction of the Republican party, the two of them worked together more harmoniously – a relationship eased further by the First Lady&#x27;s enjoyment of the company of Sherman and his wife. The President declared that Sherman accomplished much on Capitol Hill by his &quot;charm of speech and manner, and his spirit of conciliation and compromise&quot;, backed by a &quot;stubborn adherence&quot; to his principles.

During the beginning of his term, Taft, who had been associated with progressives, had to deal with Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon who was a part of the conservatives. Sherman, who had more experience in Congress, was expected to be a liaison for Taft with Cannon. “I am going to rely on you, Jim, to take care of Cannon for me. Whatever I have to do there will be done through you,” proposed Taft. Sherman replied, “Not through me. You will have to act on your own account. I am to be Vice President, and acting as a messenger boy is not part of the duties as Vice President.”

=== Re-nomination, illness, and death ===
From 1910, Taft had experienced several disagreements with ex-President Theodore Roosevelt, who formed his own Bull Moose party. This made re-election for the Republicans almost impossible, but Taft and Sherman campaigned on the same ticket in the 1912 contest, with New Yorkers once again supporting Sherman&#x27;s nomination – the first time that a sitting vice president had been re-nominated since John C. Calhoun in 1828.
Diagnosed with Bright&#x27;s disease in 1904, Sherman&#x27;s health was failing by the time of the 1912 campaign. Less than a week before the election, he died at home in Utica on October 30, six days after his 57th birthday, and President Taft was left with no running mate. Nicholas Murray Butler was designated to receive the electoral votes that Sherman would have received. Taft and Butler came in third place in the election, carrying only eight electoral votes from Utah and Vermont. Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson and his running mate Thomas R. Marshall won the election while Progressive candidate Theodore Roosevelt and his running mate Hiram Johnson came in second place. The vice presidency remained vacant until Marshall&#x27;s inauguration on March 4, 1913.

Sherman was buried at Forest Hill Cemetery in Utica.

<doc id="92208" wikidata="Q2086630" url="?curid=92208" title="Cobalt bomb">
<text>A cobalt bomb is a type of &quot;salted bomb&quot;: a nuclear weapon designed to produce enhanced amounts of radioactive fallout, intended to contaminate a large area with radioactive material, potentially for the purpose of radiological warfare, mutual assured destruction or as doomsday devices. There is no firm evidence that such a device has ever been built or tested.

== History ==
The concept of a cobalt bomb was originally described in a radio program by physicist Leó Szilárd on February 26, 1950. His intent was not to propose that such a weapon be built, but to show that nuclear weapon technology would soon reach the point where a doomsday device could end human life on Earth.

The Operation Antler/Round 1 test by the British at the Tadje site in the Maralinga range in Australia on September 14, 1957, tested a bomb using cobalt pellets as a radiochemical tracer for estimating nuclear weapon yield. This was considered a failure, and the experiment was not repeated. In Russia, the triple &quot;taiga&quot; nuclear salvo test, as part of the preliminary March 1971 Pechora–Kama Canal project, produced relatively high amounts of cobalt-60 (60Co or Co-60) from the steel that surrounded the taiga devices, with this fusion-generated neutron activation product being responsible for about half of the gamma dose in 2011 at the test site. The high percentage contribution is largely because the devices primarily used fusion rather than fission reactions, so the quantity of gamma-emitting caesium-137 fallout was comparatively low. A secondary forest now exists around the lake that was formed by the detonation.

In 2015, a page from an apparent Russian nuclear torpedo design was leaked. The design was titled &quot;Oceanic Multipurpose System Status-6&quot;, later given the official name &quot;Poseidon&quot;. The document states the torpedo would create &quot;wide areas of radioactive contamination, rendering them unusable for military, economic or other activity for a long time.&quot; Its payload would be &quot;many tens of megatons in yield&quot;. Russian government newspaper &quot;Rossiiskaya Gazeta&quot; speculated that the warhead would be a cobalt bomb. It is not known whether the Status-6 is a real project or whether it is Russian disinformation. In 2018 the Pentagon&#x27;s annual Nuclear Posture Review stated Russia is developing a system called the &quot;Status-6 Oceanic Multipurpose System&quot;. If Status-6 does exist, it is not publicly known whether the leaked 2015 design is accurate or whether the 2015 claim that the torpedo might be a cobalt bomb is genuine. Amongst other comments on it, Edward Moore Geist wrote a paper in which he says that &quot;Russian decision makers would have little confidence that these areas would be in the intended locations&quot; and Russian military experts are cited as saying that &quot;robotic torpedoes could have other purposes, such as delivering deep-sea equipment or installing surveillance devices.&quot;

==Mechanism==

A cobalt bomb could be made by placing a quantity of ordinary cobalt metal (59Co) around a thermonuclear weapon. When the bomb explodes, the neutrons produced by the fusion reaction in the secondary stage of the thermonuclear bomb&#x27;s explosion would transmute the cobalt to the radioactive cobalt-60, which would be vaporized by the explosion. The cobalt would then condense and fall back to Earth with the dust and debris from the explosion, contaminating the ground. The deposited cobalt-60 would have a half-life of 5.27 years, decaying into 60Ni and emitting two gamma rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33 MeV, hence the overall nuclear equation of the reaction is:

 + n → → + e− + gamma rays.

Nickel-60 is a stable isotope and undergoes no further decays after the transmutation is complete.

The 5.27 year half-life of the 60Co is long enough to allow it to settle out before significant decay has occurred and to render it impractical to wait in shelters for it to decay, yet short enough that intense radiation is produced. Many isotopes are more radioactive (gold-198, tantalum-182, zinc-65, sodium-24, and many more), but they would decay faster, possibly allowing some population to survive in shelters.

==Nuclear fallout==
Fission products are more deadly than neutron-activated cobalt in the first few weeks following detonation. After one to six months, the fission products from even a large-yield thermonuclear weapon decay to levels tolerable by humans. The large-yield thermonuclear weapon is thus automatically a weapon of radiological warfare, but its fallout decays much more rapidly than that of a cobalt bomb. A cobalt bomb&#x27;s fallout on the other hand would render affected areas effectively stuck in this interim state for decades: habitable but not safe for constant habitation.

Initially, gamma radiation from the fission products of an equivalent size thermonuclear weapon are much more intense than Co-60: 15,000 times more intense at 1 hour; 35 times more intense at 1 week; 5 times more intense at 1 month; and about equal at 6 months. Thereafter fission product fallout radiation levels drop off rapidly, so that Co-60 fallout is 8 times more intense than fission at 1 year and 150 times more intense at 5 years. The very long-lived isotopes produced by fission would overtake the 60Co again after about 75 years.

Complete 100% conversion into Co-60 is unlikely; a 1957 British experiment at Maralinga showed that Co-59&#x27;s neutron absorption ability was much lower than predicted, resulting in a very limited formation of Co-60 isotope in practice. In addition, fallout is not deposited evenly throughout the path downwind from a detonation, so some areas would be relatively unaffected by fallout, and the Earth would not be universally rendered lifeless by a cobalt bomb. The fallout and devastation following a nuclear detonation does not scale upwards linearly with the explosive yield. As a result, the concept of &quot;overkill&quot;—the idea that one can simply estimate the destruction and fallout created by a thermonuclear weapon of the size postulated by Leo Szilard&#x27;s &quot;cobalt bomb&quot; thought experiment by extrapolating from the effects of thermonuclear weapons of smaller yields—is fallacious.

==Example of radiation levels vs. time==
For the type of radiation given by a cobalt bomb, the dosage measured in sievert (Sv) and gray (Gy) can be treated as equivalent. This is because the relevant harmful radiation from cobalt-60 is gamma rays. When converting between sievert and gray for gamma rays, the radiation type weighting factor will be 1, and the radiation will be a highly penetrating radiation spread evenly over the body so the tissue type weighting factor will also be 1.

Assume a cobalt bomb deposits intense fallout causing a dose rate of 10 Sv per hour. At this dose rate, any unsheltered person exposed to the fallout would receive a lethal dose in about 30 minutes (assuming a median lethal dose of 5 Sv). People in well-built shelters would be safe due to radiation shielding.

* After one half-life of 5.27 years, the dose rate in the affected area would be 5 Sv/hour. At this dose rate, a person exposed to the radiation would receive a lethal dose in 1 hour.
* After 10 half-lives (about 53 years), the dose rate would have decayed to around 10 mSv/hour. At this point, a healthy person could spend up to 4 days exposed to the fallout with no &quot;immediate&quot; effects. Long-term effects from this exposure would be increased risk to develop cancer. At the 4th day, the accumulated dose will be about 1 Sv, at which point the first symptoms of acute radiation syndrome may appear.
* After 20 half-lives (about 105 years), the dose rate would have decayed to around 10 μSv/hour. At this stage, humans could remain unsheltered full-time since their yearly radiation dose would be about 80 mSv. This yearly dose rate is about 30 times greater than the average natural background radiation rate of 2.4 mSv/year, but within its variability. At this dose rate, causal connection to cancer incidence would be difficult to establish.
* After 25 half-lives (about 130 years), the dose rate from cobalt-60 would have decayed to less than 0.4 μSv/hour and could be considered negligible.

==Decontamination==

It may be possible to decontaminate relatively small areas contaminated by a cobalt bomb with equipment such as excavators and bulldozers covered with lead glass, similar to those employed at the cleanup of the Semipalatinsk Test Site. By skimming off the thin layer of fallout on the topsoil and burying it in the likes of a deep trench along with isolating it from ground water sources, the gamma air dose is cut by orders of magnitude. The decontamination after the Goiânia accident in Brazil in 1987 and the possibility of a &quot;dirty bomb&quot; with Co-60, which has similarities with the environment that one would be faced with after a nuclear yielding cobalt bomb&#x27;s fallout had settled, has prompted the invention of &quot;sequestration coatings&quot; and cheap liquid phase sorbents for Co-60 that would further aid in decontamination, including that of water.

<text>Leonard Harris Sassaman (April 9, 1980 – July 3, 2011) was an American technologist, information privacy advocate, and the maintainer of the Mixmaster anonymous remailer code and operator of the &quot;randseed&quot; remailer. Much of his career gravitated towards cryptography and protocol development.

==Early life and education==
Sassaman graduated from The Hill School in 1998. By 18, he was on the Internet Engineering Task Force responsible for the TCP/IP protocol underlying the internet. It is speculated that he may have been the anonymous creator of the Bitcoin network. He was diagnosed with depression as a teenager. In 1999, Len moved to the Bay Area, quickly became a regular in the cypherpunk community and moved in with Bram Cohen.

==Career==
Sassaman was employed as the security architect and senior systems engineer for Anonymizer. He was a PhD candidate at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium, as a researcher with the Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography (COSIC) research group, led by Bart Preneel. David Chaum and Bart Preneel were his advisors.

Sassaman was a well-known cypherpunk, cryptographer and privacy advocate. He worked for Network Associates on the PGP encryption software, was a member of the Shmoo Group, a contributor to the OpenPGP IETF working group, the GNU Privacy Guard project, and frequently appeared at technology conferences like DEF CON. Sassaman was the co-founder of CodeCon along with Bram Cohen, co-founder of the HotPETS workshop (with Roger Dingledine of Tor and Thomas Heydt-Benjamin), co-author of the Zimmermann–Sassaman key-signing protocol, and at the age of 21, was an organizer of the protests following the arrest of Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov.
On February 11, 2006, at the fifth CodeCon, Sassaman proposed to returning speaker and noted computer scientist Meredith L. Patterson during the Q&amp;A after her presentation, and they were married. The couple worked together on several research collaborations, including a critique of privacy flaws in the OLPC Bitfrost security platform, and a proposal of formal methods of analysis of computer insecurity in February 2011.

Meredith Patterson&#x27;s current startup, Osogato, aims to commercialize Patterson&#x27;s Support Vector Machine-based &quot;query by example&quot; research. Sassaman and Patterson announced Osogato&#x27;s first product, a downloadable music recommendation tool, at SuperHappyDevHouse 21 in San Francisco.

In 2009, Dan Kaminsky presented joint work with Sassaman and Patterson at Black Hat in Las Vegas, showing multiple methods for attacking the X.509 certificate authority infrastructure. Using these techniques, the team demonstrated how an attacker could obtain a certificate that clients would treat as valid for domains the attacker did not control.

==Death==

Sassaman was reported dead on July 3, 2011. Patterson stated on the same day after speaking to Belgian police that her husband&#x27;s death was &quot;unambiguously suicide&quot;. After he had stopped responding to instant messages from Patterson while she was in the United States, she asked a friend to fly to Belgium to check up on him and the friend &quot;found him hanging in the closet&quot;. He was laid to rest on July 9, 2011 at De Jacht Cemetery at Heverlee in Leuven, Belgium.

An ASCII art tribute by Dan Kaminsky in honor of Len, to be permanently embedded into Bitcoin&#x27;s Blockchain, was first announced during &quot;The Wake for Len Sassaman&quot; held at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco on July 30, 2011. Kaminsky revealed it publicly during Black Hat USA 2011 at the Caesars Palace Venue in Las Vegas.

<doc id="92211" wikidata="Q184565" url="?curid=92211" title="Charles G. Dawes">
<text>Charles Gates Dawes (August 27, 1865 – April 23, 1951) was an American diplomat and Republican politician who was the 30th vice president of the United States from 1925 to 1929 under Calvin Coolidge. He was a co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1925 for his work on the Dawes Plan for World War I reparations.

Born in Marietta, Ohio, Dawes attended Cincinnati Law School before beginning a legal career in Lincoln, Nebraska. After serving as a gas plant executive, he managed William McKinley&#x27;s 1896 presidential campaign in Illinois. After the election, McKinley appointed Dawes as the Comptroller of the Currency. He remained in that position until 1901 before forming the Central Trust Company of Illinois. Dawes served as a general during World War I and was the chairman of the general purchasing board for the American Expeditionary Forces. In 1921, President Warren G. Harding appointed Dawes as the first director of the Bureau of the Budget. Dawes served on the Allied Reparations Commission, where he helped formulate the Dawes Plan to aid the struggling German economy.

The 1924 Republican National Convention nominated President Calvin Coolidge without opposition. After former governor of Illinois Frank O. Lowden declined the vice-presidential nomination, the convention chose Dawes as Coolidge&#x27;s running mate. The Republican ticket won the 1924 presidential election, and Dawes was sworn in as vice president in 1925. Dawes helped pass the McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill in Congress, but President Coolidge vetoed it. Dawes was a candidate for renomination at the 1928 Republican National Convention, but Coolidge&#x27;s opposition to Dawes helped ensure that Charles Curtis was nominated instead. In 1929, President Herbert Hoover appointed Dawes to be the ambassador to the United Kingdom. Dawes also briefly led the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which organized a government response to the Great Depression. He resigned from that position in 1932 to return to banking, and died in 1951 of coronary thrombosis.

==Early life and family==
Dawes was born in Marietta, Ohio, in Washington County, on August 27, 1865, the son of Civil War General Rufus Dawes and his wife Mary Beman Gates. Rufus had commanded the 6th Wisconsin Regiment of the Iron Brigade from 1863 to 1864 during the American Civil War. His uncle Ephraim C. Dawes was a major who served under Ulysses S. Grant at the Shiloh and Siege of Vicksburg, and was severely wounded at the Battle of Dallas, Georgia, in May 1864.

Dawes&#x27;s brothers were Rufus C. Dawes, Beman Gates Dawes, and Henry May Dawes, all prominent businessmen or politicians. He had two sisters, Mary Frances Dawes Beach, and Betsey Gates Dawes Hoyt.

Dawes was a descendant of Edward Doty, a passenger on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, and William Dawes who rode with Paul Revere to warn American colonists of the advancing British army at the outbreak of the American Revolution.

Dawes married Caro Blymyer on January 24, 1889. They had a son, Rufus Fearing (1890–1912), and a daughter, Carolyn. They later adopted two children, Dana and Virginia.

He graduated from Marietta College in 1884 and Cincinnati Law School in 1886. His fraternity was Delta Upsilon.

== Early business career ==

Dawes was admitted to the bar in Nebraska, and he practiced in Lincoln, Nebraska, from 1887 to 1894. When Lieutenant John Pershing, the future army general, was military instructor at the University of Nebraska he and Dawes met and formed a lifelong friendship. Pershing also received a law degree at Nebraska and proposed leaving the army to go into private practice with Dawes, who cautioned him against giving up the regular army pay for the uncertainty of legal remuneration. Dawes also met Democratic Congressman William Jennings Bryan. The two became friends despite their disagreement over free silver policies.

Dawes relocated from Lincoln to Chicago during the Panic of 1893. In 1894, Dawes acquired interests in several Midwestern gas plants. He became the president of both the La Crosse Gas Light Company in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and the Northwestern Gas Light and Coke Company in Evanston, Illinois.

==Interest in music==

Dawes was a self-taught pianist, flutist and composer. His composition &quot;Melody in A Major&quot; became a well-known piano and violin piece in 1912. Marie Edwards made a popular arrangement of the work in 1921. Also, in 1921, it was arranged for a small orchestra by Adolf G. Hoffmann. &quot;Melody in A Major&quot; was played at many official functions that Dawes attended.

In 1951, Carl Sigman added lyrics to &quot;Melody in A Major&quot;, transforming it into the song &quot;It&#x27;s All in the Game&quot;. Tommy Edwards&#x27;s recording of &quot;It&#x27;s All in the Game&quot; was a number-one hit on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; record chart for six weeks in 1958. Edwards&#x27;s version of the song became number one on the United Kingdom chart that year.

Since then, it has become a pop standard. Numerous artists have recorded versions, including Cliff Richard, the Four Tops, Isaac Hayes, Jackie DeShannon, Van Morrison, Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole, Brook Benton, Elton John, Mel Carter, Donny and Marie Osmond, Barry Manilow, Merle Haggard, and Keith Jarrett.

Dawes is the only U.S. vice president to be credited with a number-one pop hit. Dawes and Bob Dylan (as a writer) are the only persons credited with a number-one pop hit to have also won a Nobel Prize.

Dawes was a brother of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia.

==Early political career==
Dawes&#x27;s prominent positions in business caught the attention of Republican party leaders. They asked Dawes to manage the Illinois portion of William McKinley&#x27;s bid for the Presidency of the United States in 1896. Following McKinley&#x27;s election, Dawes was named Comptroller of the Currency, United States Department of the Treasury. Serving in that position from 1898 to 1901, he collected more than $25 million from banks that had failed during the Panic of 1893 and changed banking practices to try to prevent another panic.

In October 1901, Dawes left the Department of the Treasury to pursue a U.S. Senate seat from Illinois. He thought that, with the help of the McKinley Administration, he could win it. McKinley was assassinated and his successor, President Theodore Roosevelt, preferred Dawes&#x27;s opponent, Albert J. Hopkins. In 1902, following this unsuccessful attempt at legislative office, Dawes declared that he was done with politics. He organized the Central Trust Company of Illinois, where he served as its president until 1921.

On September 5, 1912, Dawes&#x27;s 21-year-old son Rufus drowned in Geneva Lake, while on summer break from Princeton University. In his memory, Dawes created homeless shelters in both Chicago and Boston and financed the construction of a dormitory at his son&#x27;s alma mater, the Lawrenceville School in Lawrenceville, New Jersey.

==World War I==

Dawes helped support the first Anglo-French Loan to the Entente powers of $500 million. Dawes&#x27;s support was important because the House of Morgan needed public support from a non-Morgan banker. The Morgan banker Thomas W. Lamont said that Dawes&#x27;s support would &quot;make a position for him in the banking world such as he otherwise could never hope to make&quot;. (Loans were seen as possibly violating neutrality, and Wilson was still resisting permitting loans.)

During WWI, Dawes was commissioned as a major on June 11, 1917, in the 17th Engineers. He was subsequently promoted to lieutenant colonel (July 17, 1917), and colonel (January 16, 1918). In October 1918, he was promoted to brigadier general. From August 1917 to August 1919, Dawes served in France during WWI as chairman of the general purchasing board for the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF). His proposal to Gen. Pershing was adopted informed the Military Board of Allied Supply, on which he served as the American delegate in 1918. When the war ended in November, he became a member of the Liquidation Commission of the United States War Department. He was decorated with the Distinguished Service Medal and the French in recognition of his service. He returned to the US aboard the SS &quot;Leviathan&quot; in August 1919. Dawes published a memoir of his World War I service, &quot;A Journal of the Great War&quot;, 1921.

In February 1921, the U.S. Senate held hearings on war expenditures. During heated testimony, Dawes burst out, &quot;Hell and Maria, we weren&#x27;t trying to keep a set of books over there, we were trying to win a war!&quot; He was later known as &quot;Hell and Maria Dawes&quot; (although he always insisted the expression was &quot;Helen Maria&quot;, an exclamation he claimed was common in Nebraska). Dawes resigned from the Army in 1919 and became a member of the American Legion.

==1920s: Financing Europe and the Nobel Peace Prize==
He supported Frank O. Lowden at the 1920 Republican National Convention, but the presidential nomination went to Warren G. Harding. When the Bureau of the Budget was created, he was appointed in 1921 by President Harding as its first director. Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover appointed him to the Allied Reparations Commission in 1923. Dawes chaired the group that devised the solution to the European crisis: through the Dawes Plan, American banks loaned large sums of money to Germany. The loans helped Germany&#x27;s industrial production to recover and the government to make reparation payments to France and Belgium as required by the Versailles Treaty. France and Belgium in turn agreed to withdraw the troops that had been occupying the Ruhr since January 1923. In 1929 the Reparations Commission under Owen Young replaced the plan with the more permanent Young Plan, which reduced the total amount of reparations and called for the removal of occupying forces from the Rhineland. For his work on the Dawes Plan and the resulting reduction of tensions between France and Germany, Dawes shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1925.

==Vice presidency (1925–1929)==


At the 1924 Republican National Convention, President Calvin Coolidge was selected almost without opposition to be the Republican presidential nominee. The vice-presidential nominee was more contested. Governor Lowden was nominated, but declined. Coolidge&#x27;s next choice was Idaho Senator William Borah, who also declined the nomination. The Republican National Chairman, William Butler, wanted to nominate then-Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover, but he was insufficiently popular. Eventually, the delegates chose Dawes. Coolidge quickly accepted the delegates&#x27; choice and felt that Dawes would be loyal to him and make a strong addition to his campaign.

Dawes traveled throughout the country during the campaign, giving speeches to bolster the Republican ticket. On August 22, Dawes would appear at a rally located in Augusta, Maine on the behalf of Republican candidate for Governor Ralph Owen Brewster, who was accused by his opponent William Robinson Pattangall of being backed by the Ku Klux Klan and having sympathies for them. Dawes, who was challenged by Pattangall to talk on the issue, gave a speech attacking the Klan and its religious and racial prejudice rhetoric (Dawes was however careful on how he talked about race). He frequently attacked Progressive nominee Robert M. La Follette as a dangerous radical who sympathized with the Bolsheviks. The Coolidge-Dawes ticket was elected on November 4, 1924, with more popular votes than the candidates of the Democratic and Progressive parties combined. The inauguration was held on March 4, 1925.

=== Speech to Senate ===
When Dawes took the oath on March 4, he would take action and infamously go on a tangent against the Senate&#x27;s filibuster. In the speech, Dawes criticized rule XXII, calling it &quot;undemocratic&quot; and noted how it was easily taken advantage of due to its two-thirds voting procedure. Through most of the speech, Dawes pointed at specific senators and repeatedly slammed his fist on a table. Chief Justice William Howard Taft wrote to his son that the vice president had &quot;made a monkey out of himself.&quot; Alongside annoying the entire Senate with a speech that left many shocked, Dawes ended up irritating them again that same day, by having the senators be sworn in one by one (usually they would take the oath in groups). Dawes would end up stealing the thunder from Coolidge that day. With many in the press afterwards making a joke out of Dawes, Coolidge was very upset with how the vice president was starting off his term.

=== Nomination of Charles B. Warren ===
On March 10, the Senate debated the president&#x27;s nomination of Charles B. Warren to be United States Attorney General. In the wake of the Teapot Dome scandal and other scandals, Democrats and Progressive Republicans objected to the nomination because of Warren&#x27;s close association with the Sugar Trust. At midday, six speakers were scheduled to address Warren&#x27;s nomination. Desiring to take a break for a nap, Dawes consulted the majority and minority leaders, who assured him that no vote would be taken that afternoon. After Dawes left the Senate, all but one of the scheduled speakers decided against making formal remarks, and a vote was taken. When it became apparent that the vote would be tied, Republican leaders hastily called Dawes at the Willard Hotel, and he immediately left for the Capitol. The first vote was 40-40, a tie which Dawes could have broken in Warren&#x27;s favor. While waiting for Dawes to arrive, the only Democratic senator who had voted for Warren switched his vote. The nomination then failed 41-39—the first such rejection of a president&#x27;s nominee in nearly 60 years. This incident was chronicled in a derisive poem, based on the Longfellow poem &quot;Paul Revere&#x27;s Ride&quot;; it began with the line, &quot;Come gather round children and hold your applause for the afternoon ride of Charlie Dawes.&quot; The choice of poem was based on Charles Dawes being descended from William Dawes, who rode with Paul Revere.

Dawes and Coolidge became alienated from one another. Dawes declined to attend Cabinet meetings and annoyed Coolidge with his attack on the Senate filibuster. Dawes championed the McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill, which sought to alleviate the 1920s farm crisis by having the government buy surplus farm produce and sell that surplus in foreign markets. Dawes helped ensure the passage of the bill through Congress, but President Coolidge vetoed it.

In 1927, Coolidge announced that he would not seek re-election. Dawes again favored Frank Lowden at the 1928 Republican National Convention, but the convention chose Herbert Hoover. Rumors circulated about Dawes being chosen as Hoover&#x27;s running mate. Coolidge made it known that he would consider the renomination of Dawes as vice president to be an insult. Charles Curtis of Kansas, known for his skills in collaboration, was chosen as Hoover&#x27;s running mate.

==Post-vice presidency (1929–1951)==

===Court of St. James&#x27;s and the RFC===
After Dawes completed his term as vice president, he served as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom (known formally as the Court of St. James&#x27;s) from 1929 to 1931. Overall, Dawes was an effective ambassador, as George V&#x27;s son, the future Edward VIII, later confirmed in his memoirs. Dawes was rather rough-hewn for some of his duties, disliking presenting American débutantes to the King. On his first visit to the royal court, in deference to American public opinion, he refused to wear the customary Court dress, which then included knee breeches. This episode was said to upset the King, who had been prevented by illness from attending the event.

As the Great Depression continued to ravage the US, Dawes accepted President Herbert Hoover&#x27;s appeal to leave diplomatic office and head the newly created Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC). After a few months, Dawes resigned from the RFC. As chairman of the failing Central Republic Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, he felt obligated to work for its rescue. Political opponents alleged that, under Dawes&#x27;s leadership, the RFC had given preferential treatment to his bank. This marked the end of Dawes&#x27;s career in public service. For the 1932 election, Hoover considered the possibility of adding Dawes to the ticket in place of Curtis, but Dawes declined the potential offer.

Later in 1932, Dawes and associates formed the City National Bank and Trust Co. to take over the deposits of the failed Central Republic Bank and Trust Company. In 1936, Republican congressional leaders informally approached Dawes about the possibility of heading up their presidential ticket at that year&#x27;s presidential election, hoping for a candidate associated with the prosperous Coolidge years, but Dawes had no interest in returning to front-line politics; the (ultimately unsuccessful) ticket would instead be headed by Alf Landon.

== Later life ==
Dawes served for nearly two decades as chairman of the board of City National from 1932 until his death. He died on April 23, 1951, at his Evanston home from coronary thrombosis at the age of 85. He is interred in Rosehill Cemetery, Chicago.

==Personal life==
Dawes belonged to several lineage societies and veterans&#x27; organizations. These included the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, Sons of the American Revolution, General Society of Colonial Wars, American Legion, and Forty and Eight.
Dawes was also a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts from 1925 until his death in 1951

==Honors==
* In 1925, Dawes was a co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on WWI reparations.
A Chicago public school located at 3810 W 81st Place is named in his honor, as are an Evanston public school at 440 Dodge Avenue and Evanston&#x27;s Dawes Park at 1700 Sheridan Road.

===United States military awards===
* Distinguished Service Medal
* World War I Victory Medal

Distinguished Service Medal citation:
===Foreign honors===
* Companion of the Order of the Bath (United Kingdom)
* Commander of the Legion of Honor (France)
* Commander of the Order of Leopold (Belgium)
* Croix de Guerre with palm (France)

==Legacy==
According to Annette Dunlap, Dawes was:
In 1944, he bequeathed his lakeshore home in Evanston to Northwestern University for the Evanston Historical Society (later renamed the Evanston History Center). Dawes lived in the house until his death. The Dawes family continued to occupy it until the death of Mrs. Dawes in 1957. Since then, the Evanston History Center operates out of the house and manages it as a museum. Designated a National Historic Landmark, the Charles G. Dawes House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="92213" wikidata="Q271023" url="?curid=92213" title="Charles Curtis">
<text>Charles Curtis (January 25, 1860 – February 8, 1936) was an American attorney and Republican politician from Kansas who served as the 31st vice president of the United States from 1929 to 1933 under Herbert Hoover and the Senate Majority Leader from 1924 to 1929. A member of the Kaw Nation born in the Kansas Territory, Curtis was the first Native American to serve in the United States Congress, where he served in the United States House of Representatives and Senate before becoming Senate Majority Leader. Curtis also was the first Native American and first multiracial person to serve as Vice President.

Curtis believed that Native Americans could benefit from mainstream education and assimilation. He entered political life when he was 32 years old and won several terms from his district in Topeka, Kansas, beginning in 1892 as a Republican to the U.S. House of Representatives. There, he sponsored and helped pass the Curtis Act of 1898, which extended the Dawes Act to the Five Civilized Tribes of the Indian Territory. Despite Curtis being unhappy with the final version of it, implementation of the Act completed the ending of tribal land titles in the Indian Territory and prepared the larger territory to be admitted as the State of Oklahoma in 1907. The government tried to encourage Indians to accept individual citizenship and lands and to take up European-American culture.

Curtis was elected to the U.S. Senate first by the Kansas Legislature in 1906 and then by popular vote in 1914, 1920, and 1926. Curtis served one six-year term from 1907 to 1913 and then most of three terms from 1915 to 1929, when he was elected as vice president. His long popularity and connections in Kansas and federal politics helped make Curtis a strong leader in the Senate. He marshaled support to be elected as Republican Whip from 1915 to 1924 and then as Senate Majority Leader from 1924 to 1929. In those positions, he was instrumental in managing legislation and in accomplishing Republican national goals.

Curtis received the nomination for vice president at the 1928 Republican National Convention, and became Herbert Hoover&#x27;s running mate; the two won the 1928 United States presidential election in a landslide victory. In 1932, he became the first United States vice president to open the Olympic Games. However, when Curtis and Hoover ran together again in 1932 during the Great Depression, they lost as the public gave the Democrats Franklin D. Roosevelt and John Nance Garner a landslide victory that year.

Curtis remains the highest-ranking enrolled Native American who ever served in the federal government. He is also the most recent officer of the executive branch to have been born in a territory, rather than a state or federal district.

== Early life and education ==
Born on January 25, 1860, in North Topeka, Kansas Territory, a year before Kansas was admitted as a state, Charles Curtis had three-eighths Native American ancestry and five-eighths European American ancestry. His mother, Ellen Papin (also spelled Pappan), was Kaw, Osage, Potawatomi, and French. His father, Orren Curtis, was of English, Scots, and Welsh ancestry. On his mother&#x27;s side, Curtis was a descendant of chief White Plume of the Kaw Nation and chief Pawhuska of the Osage.

Curtis&#x27;s first words as an infant were in French and Kansa, both languages that he learned from his mother. She died in 1863, when he was 3 years old, but he lived for some time thereafter with his maternal grandparents on the Kaw reservation and returned to them in later years. He learned to love racing horses and was later a highly successful jockey in prairie horse races.

After Curtis&#x27;s mother died in 1863, his father remarried but soon divorced. While serving in the Union army during the Civil War, Orren Curtis was captured and imprisoned. During that period, the toddler Charles was cared for by his maternal grandparents. They also later helped him gain possession of his mother&#x27;s land in North Topeka; under the Kaw matrilineal system, he inherited it from her. His father tried unsuccessfully to get control of that land. Orren Curtis married a third time and had a daughter, Theresa Permelia &quot;Dolly&quot; Curtis, who was born in 1866, after the end of the war.

On June 1, 1868, one hundred Cheyenne warriors invaded the Kaw Reservation. The Kaw men painted their faces, donned regalia, and rode out on horseback to confront the Cheyenne. The rival Indian warriors put on a display of superb horsemanship, accompanied with war cries and volleys of bullets and arrows. Terrified white settlers took refuge in nearby Council Grove. After about four hours, the Cheyenne retired with a few stolen horses and a peace offering of coffee and sugar from the Council Grove merchants. No one had been injured on either side. During the battle, Joe Jim, a Kaw interpreter, galloped to Topeka to seek assistance from the governor. Riding with Jim was the eight-year-old Charles Curtis, then nicknamed &quot;Indian Charley.&quot;

Curtis re-enrolled in the Kaw Nation, which had been removed from Kansas to the Indian Territory when he was in his teens. Curtis was strongly influenced by both sets of grandparents. After living on the reservation with his maternal grandparents, M. Papin and Julie Gonville, he returned to the city of Topeka. There, he lived with his paternal grandparents while he attended Topeka High School. Both grandmothers encouraged his education.

Curtis read law in an established firm, where he worked part time. He was admitted to the bar in 1881 and began his practice in Topeka. He served as prosecuting attorney of Shawnee County, Kansas, from 1885 to 1889.

== Marriage and family ==
On November 27, 1884, Curtis married Annie Elizabeth Baird (1860–1924). They had three children: Permelia Jeannette Curtis (1886–1955), Henry &quot;Harry&quot; King Curtis (1890–1946), and Leona Virginia Curtis (1892–1965). He and his wife also provided a home in Topeka for his paternal sister Dolly Curtis before her marriage. His wife died in 1924.

A widower when he was elected vice president in 1928, Curtis had his long-since-married sister, Dolly Curtis Gann (March 1866 – January 30, 1953), act as his official hostess for social events. She had lived with her husband, Edward Everett Gann, in Washington, D.C., since about 1903. He was a lawyer and once an assistant attorney general in the government. Attuned to social protocol, Dolly Gann insisted in 1929 on being treated officially as the second woman in government at social functions. The diplomatic corps voted to change a State Department protocol to acknowledge that while her brother was in office.

To date, Curtis is the last vice president to remain unmarried during his entire time in office. Alben W. Barkley, who served as vice president from 1949 to 1953, entered office as a widower but remarried while in office.

== House of Representatives (1893–1907) ==

First elected as a Republican to the House of Representatives of the 53rd Congress, Curtis was re-elected for the following six terms. Naturally gregarious, he also made the effort to learn about his many constituents and treated them as personal friends.

Curtis promoted cultural assimilation of Native Americans into the dominant white American society, most notably in the Curtis Act of 1898. In his hand-written autobiography, Curtis noted having been unhappy with the final version of the Curtis Act. This was due to the bill HR 8581 having gone through five revisions in committees in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, with little left of Curtis&#x27;s original draft. He believed that the Five Civilized Tribes needed to make changes, and that the way ahead for Native Americans was through education and use of both their and the majority cultures. However, he also had hoped to give more support to Native American transitions, something which Congress was not prepared to extend.

In 1902, the Kaw Allotment Act disbanded the Kaw Nation as a legal entity and provided for the allotment of its communal land to members in a process similar to that experienced by other tribes. The act transferred 160 acres (0.6 km2) of former tribal land to the federal government. Other land that had been held in common was allocated to individual tribal members. Under the terms of the act, as enrolled tribal members, Curtis and his three children were allotted about 1,625 acres (6.6 km2) of Kaw land near Washunga in Oklahoma.

Curtis served several consecutive terms in the House from March 4, 1893, to January 28, 1907.

== Senate (1907–1913, 1915–1929) ==


Curtis resigned from the House after he had been elected by the Kansas Legislature to the U.S. Senate seat that was left vacant by the resignation of Joseph R. Burton. Curtis served the remainder of his current term, which ended on March 4, 1907. (Popular election of U.S. senators had not yet been mandated by constitutional amendment.) At the same time, the legislature elected Curtis to the next full Senate term. From March 4, 1907, he served until March 3, 1913. In 1912, Democrats won control of the Kansas legislature and so Curtis was not re-elected.

The 17th Amendment, providing for direct popular election of Senators, was adopted in 1913. In 1914, Curtis was elected to Kansas&#x27;s other Senate seat by popular vote and was re-elected in 1920 and 1926. In total, he served from March 4, 1915, to March 3, 1929, when he resigned to become vice president.

During his tenure in the Senate, Curtis was President pro tempore, Chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of the Interior, of the Committee on Indian Depredations, and of the Committee on Coast Defenses; and Chairman of the Republican Senate Conference. He also was elected for a decade as Senate Minority Whip and for four years as Senate Majority Leader after Republicans won control of the chamber. He had experience in all the senior leadership positions in the Senate and was highly respected for his ability to work with members on both sides of the aisle.

In 1923, Curtis, together with his fellow Kansan Representative Daniel Read Anthony Jr., proposed the first version of the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to each of their Houses. The amendment did not pass.

Curtis&#x27;s leadership abilities were demonstrated by his election as Republican Whip from 1915 to 1924 and Majority Leader from 1925 to 1929. He was effective in collaboration and moving legislation forward in the Senate. Idaho Senator William Borah acclaimed Curtis as &quot;a great reconciler, a walking political encyclopedia and one of the best political poker players in America.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine featured him on the cover in December 1926 and reported that &quot;it is in the party caucuses, in the committee rooms, in the cloakrooms that he patches up troubles, puts through legislation&quot; as one of the two leading senators, the other being Reed Smoot.

Curtis was remembered for not making many speeches and was noted for keeping the &quot;best card index of the state ever made.&quot; Curtis used a black notebook and later a card index to record all the people whom he met in office or while he was campaigning. He continually referred to it, which resulted in his being known for &quot;his remarkable memory for faces and names:&quot;

Curtis was celebrated as a &quot;stand patter&quot;, the most regular of Republicans but also as a man who could always bargain with his party&#x27;s progressives and with Senators from across the aisle.

== Vice presidency (1929–1933) ==

Curtis received 64 votes on the presidential ballot at the 1928 Republican National Convention in Kansas City out of 1,084 total. The winning candidate, Herbert Hoover, secured 837 votes and had been the favorite for the nomination since August 1927, when President Calvin Coolidge took himself out of contention. Curtis was a leader of the anti-Hoover movement and had formed an alliance with two of his Senate colleagues, Guy Goff and James E. Watson, as well as Governor Frank Lowden of Illinois. Hoover&#x27;s pedigree as a progressive follower of Theodore Roosevelt did not sit well with conservatives like Curtis. Less than a week before the convention, he described Hoover as a man &quot;for whom the party will be on the defensive from the day he is named until the close of the polls on election day.&quot; However, Curtis had no qualms about accepting the vice-presidential nomination.

Although Hoover gave few speeches during the 1928 presidential campaign, Curtis traveled coast to coast and spoke almost every day. While covering the convention, H. L. Mencken described Curtis as &quot;the Kansas comic character, who is half Indian and half windmill. Charlie ran against Hoover with great energy, and let fly some very embarrassing truths about him. But when the Hoover managers threw Charlie the Vice-Presidency as a solatium, he shut up instantly, and a few days later he was hymning his late bugaboo as the greatest statesman since Pericles.&quot;

The Hoover–Curtis ticket won the 1928 presidential election in a landslide by receiving 444 out of the 531 Electoral College votes and 58.2% of the popular vote. Curtis resigned from the Senate the day before he was sworn in as vice-president. After he took the oath of office in the Senate Chamber, the presidential party proceeded to the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol for Hoover&#x27;s inauguration. Curtis arranged for a Native American jazz band to perform at the inauguration.

Curtis&#x27;s election as vice president made history because he was the only native Kansan, and the only Native American to hold the post. The first person enrolled in a Native American tribe to be elected to such a high office, Curtis decorated his office with Native American artifacts and posed for pictures wearing Indian headdresses. He was 69 years old when he took office, which made him the oldest incoming vice-president at the time.

Curtis was the first vice-president to take the oath of office on a Bible in the same manner as the President. Curtis named Lola M. Williams as private secretary to the vice-president, and Williams was one of the first women to enter the Senate floor, which was traditionally a male monopoly.

Soon after the Great Depression began, Curtis had endorsed the five-day work week with no reduction in wages as a work-sharing solution to unemployment. In October 1930, in the middle of the campaign for 1930 midterm elections, Curtis made an offhand remark that &quot;good times are just around the corner&quot;. The statement was later erroneously attributed to Hoover and became a &quot;lethal political boomerang.&quot;

At the 1932 Republican National Convention, Hoover was renominated almost unanimously. Curtis failed to secure a majority of votes on the first ballot for the vice-presidential nomination. He received 559.25 out of 1,154 votes (or 48.5%), with Generals Hanford MacNider (15.8%) and James Harbord (14.0%) being his nearest contenders. On the second ballot, the Pennsylvania delegation shifted its votes to Curtis from Edward Martin, which gave him 634.25 votes (54.9%) and secured him the nomination for the second time.

Curtis opened the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and so became the first U.S. executive branch officer to open the Olympic Games.

Curtis cast three tie-breaking votes in the Senate.

Following the stock market crash in 1929, the problems of the Great Depression deepened during the Hoover administration and resulted in the defeat of the Republican ticket in 1932. The Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected in 1932 as president, with a popular vote of 57% to 40%. Curtis&#x27;s term as vice president ended on March 4, 1933. Curtis&#x27;s final duty as vice president was to administer the oath of office to his successor, John Nance Garner, whose swearing-in ceremony was the last full-term swearing-in to take place in the Senate Chamber.

== Post–vice presidency (1933–1936) ==
Curtis decided to stay in Washington, D.C., to resume his legal career, as he had a wide network of professional contacts from his long career in Congress and the executive branch. He participated in one of the earliest known triathlons in the city.

Curtis died from a heart attack on February 8, 1936, at the age of 76. By his wishes, his body was returned to Kansas and buried next to his wife at the Topeka Cemetery.

== Legacy and honors ==
Curtis was the first multiracial person to serve as Vice President of the United States, and was the only one until Kamala Harris was inaugurated in 2021. Curtis was also the only United States vice president to have inaugurated the Olympic Games. Over the course of his career, Curtis was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine on three occasions. Two of these appearances – on December 20, 1926, and June 18, 1928 – occurred while Curtis was a senator. The third occasion was December 5, 1932, during the final months of his vice presidency.

Curtis&#x27;s house in Topeka, Kansas, is now operated as a historic house museum known as the Charles Curtis House Museum. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated as a state historic site.

<text>The Tsar Bomba (, ; code name: &quot;Ivan&quot; or &quot;Vanya&quot;), also known by the alphanumerical designation &quot;AN602&quot;, was a thermonuclear aerial bomb, and the most powerful nuclear weapon ever created and tested. The Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov oversaw the project at Arzamas-16, while the main work of design was by Sakharov, Viktor Adamsky, Yuri Babayev, , and Yuri Trutnev. The project was ordered by CPSU first secretary Nikita Khrushchev in July 1961 as part of the Soviet resumption of nuclear testing after the Test Ban Moratorium, with the detonation timed to coincide with the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).

Tested on 30 October 1961, the test verified new design principles for high-yield thermonuclear charges, allowing, as its final report put it, the design of a nuclear device &quot;of practically unlimited power&quot;. The bomb was dropped by parachute from a Tu-95V aircraft, and detonated autonomously above the cape Sukhoy Nos of Severny Island, Novaya Zemlya, from Mityushikha Bay, north of the Matochkin Strait. The detonation was monitored by United States intelligence agencies, via a KC-135A aircraft (Operation &quot;SpeedLight&quot;) in the area at the time. A secret U.S. reconnaissance aircraft named &quot;Speed Light Alpha&quot; monitored the blast, coming close enough to have its anti-radiation paint scorched.

The bhangmeter results and other data suggested the bomb yielded around , which was the accepted yield in technical literature until 1991, when Soviet scientists revealed that their instruments indicated a yield of . As they had the instrumental data and access to the test site, their yield figure has been accepted as more accurate. In theory, the bomb would have had a yield over if it had included the uranium-238 tamper which featured in the design but was omitted in the test to reduce radioactive fallout. As only one bomb was built to completion, that capability has never been demonstrated. The remaining bomb casings are located at the Russian Atomic Weapon Museum in Sarov and the Museum of Nuclear Weapons, All-Russian Scientific Research Institute Of Technical Physics, in Snezhinsk.

Tsar Bomba was a modification of an earlier project, RN202, which used a ballistic case of the same size but a very different internal mechanism. Many published books, even some authored by those involved in product development of 602, contain inaccuracies that are replicated elsewhere, including wrongly identifying Tsar Bomba as RDS-202 or RN202.

== Background ==
In the late 1950s Cold War, the US nuclear weapons arsenal greatly exceeded that of the USSR in quantity of weapons, total explosive yield of weapons, and the ability to deliver the weapon. In the early part of the decade, the Strategic Air Command had begun deploying nuclear-capable bombers, as well as actual weapons, to airbases hosted by US allies within striking distance of the Soviet Union, as well as deploying them on aircraft carriers and on medium-range ballistic missiles in the United Kingdom. The USSR had a credible ability to threaten American allies in Western Europe and Asia via a limited bomber and short-range missile force, had tested a multi-stage thermonuclear weapon in 1955, and had begun testing a prototype rocket for an intercontinental ballistic missile in 1957. Its leadership was well aware that the USSR&#x27;s deployed nuclear forces in 1960 could not reliably and credibly threaten targets in the continental United States, and that in the event of war, the Soviet Union would struggle to reply in kind. This in turn threatened to weaken Soviet leverage in hot-spots like Berlin, which had been the subject of Soviet and American tension since the end of World War II.

Given the Soviet Union&#x27;s strategic disadvantage concerning America&#x27;s nuclear weapons possessions, foreign policy and propaganda considerations during the leaderships of Georgy Malenkov and Nikita Khrushchev made a response to the perceived US nuclear blackmail imperative for both international and domestic reasons. The creation of the Tsar Bomba represented part of a larger effort to maintain the concept of nuclear deterrence, and to impress (and terrify) both domestic and international audiences with the strength of the Soviet nuclear weapons program, even though the weapon itself was arguably impractical.

== Name ==
The bomb was officially known as &quot;product 602&quot; () or &quot;AN602&quot;, and codenamed &quot;Ivan&quot;. The usage of different names can be a source of confusion. The Tsar Bomba, being a modification of (the) RN202, is sometimes mistakenly labelled as RDS-37, RDS-202 or PH202 (product 202).

Unofficially, the bomb would later become known as &quot;Tsar Bomba&quot; and &quot;Kuzka&#x27;s mother&quot; (, ). The name Tsar Bomba (loosely translated as &quot;Emperor of Bombs&quot;) comes from an allusion to two other Russian historical artifacts, the Tsar Cannon and the Tsar Bell, both of which were created as showpieces but whose large size made them impractical for use. The name &quot;Tsar Bomba&quot; does not seem to have been used for the weapon prior to the 1990s. The name &quot;Kuzka&#x27;s Mother&quot; was inspired by the statement of Khrushchev to then US Vice President Richard Nixon: &quot;We have funds at our disposal that will have dire consequences for you. We will show you Kuzka&#x27;s mother!&quot;

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) designated the test as &quot;JOE 111&quot; using their &quot;JOE&quot; counting scheme, which had begun with RDS-1 in 1949.

== Development ==

The development of a very large bomb began in 1956 and was carried out in two stages. At the first stage, from 1956 to 1958, it was &quot;product 202&quot;, which was developed in the recently created NII-1011. The modern name of NII-1011 is the &quot;Russian Federal Nuclear Center or the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Technical Physics&quot; (RFNC-VNIITF). According to the official history of the institute, the order on the creation of a research institute in the system of the Ministry of Medium Machine Building was signed on 5 April 1955; work at the NII-1011 began a little later.

At the second stage of development, from 1960 to a successful test in 1961, the bomb was called &quot;item 602&quot; and was developed at KB-11 (VNIIEF), V. B. Adamsky was developing, and the physical scheme was developed by Andrei Sakharov, Yu. N. Babaev, Yu. N. Smirnov, and Yu. A. Trutnev.

After the successful test of the RDS-37, KB-11 employees (Sakharov, Zeldovich, and Dovidenko) performed a preliminary calculation and, on 2 February 1956, they handed over to N. I. Pavlov, a note with the parameters for charges of and the possibility of increasing the power to .

After the creation in 1955 of the second nuclear center – NII-1011, in 1956, by a resolution of the Council of Ministers, the center was assigned the task of developing an ultra-high-power charge, which was called &quot;Project 202&quot;.

On 12 March 1956, a draft Joint Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU Central Committee) and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on the preparation and testing of the 202 product was adopted. The project planned to develop a version of the RDS-37 with a capacity of .
RDS-202 was designed with a maximum calculated power release of , with a diameter of , a length of , weighing with a parachute system and structurally coordinated with the Tu-95-202 carrier aircraft specially converted for its use. On 6 June 1956, the NII-1011 report described the RDS-202 thermonuclear device with a design power of up to with the required task of . In reality, this device was developed with an estimated power of , after testing the products &quot;40GN&quot;, &quot;245&quot; and &quot;205&quot; its tests were deemed inappropriate and canceled.

The Tsar Bomba differs from its parent design – the RN202 – in several places. The Tsar Bomba was a three-stage bomb with a Trutnev-Babaev second- and third-stage design, with a yield of 50 Mt. This is equivalent to about 1,570 times the combined energy of the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 10 times the combined energy of all the conventional explosives used in World War II, one quarter of the estimated yield of the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, and 10% of the combined yield of all other nuclear tests to date. A three-stage hydrogen bomb uses a fission bomb primary to compress a thermonuclear secondary, as in most hydrogen bombs, and then uses energy from the resulting explosion to compress a much larger additional thermonuclear stage. There is evidence that the Tsar Bomba had several third stages rather than a single very large one. RDS-202 was assembled on the principle of radiation implosion, which was previously tested during the creation of RDS-37. Since it used a much heavier secondary module than in the RDS-37, two primary modules (charges), located on opposite sides of the secondary module, were used to compress it. This physical charging scheme was later used in the design of the AN-602, but the AN-602 thermonuclear charge itself (secondary module) was new. The RDS-202 thermonuclear charge was manufactured in 1956, and was planned for testing in 1957, but was not tested and put into storage. Two years after the manufacture of the RDS-202, in July 1958, it was decided to remove it from storage, dismantle and use automation units and charge parts for experimental work. The CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers of the USSR adopted a draft Joint Resolution on 12 March 1956, on the preparation and testing of &quot;izdeliye 202&quot;, which read:

=== Product 602 ===

In 1960, KB-11 began developing a thermonuclear device with a design capacity of . In February 1961, the leaders of KB-11 sent a letter to the Central Committee of the CPSU with the subject line &quot;Some questions of the development of nuclear weapons and methods of their use&quot;, which, among other things, raised the question of the expediency of developing such a 100 Mt device. On 10 July 1961, a discussion took place in the Central Committee of the CPSU, at which First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev supported the development and testing of this super-powerful bomb.

To speed up the work on Tsar Bomba, it was based on the 202 Project, but was a new project, developed by a different group. For KB-11, six casings for the Project 202 bomb already manufactured at NII-1011 and a set of equipment developed for the 202 Project testing were used.

Tsar Bomba had a &quot;three-stage&quot; design: the first stage is the necessary fission trigger. The second stage was two relatively small thermonuclear charges with a calculated contribution to the explosion of , which were used for radiation implosion of the third stage, the main thermonuclear module located between them, and starting a thermonuclear reaction in it, contributing 50 Mt of explosion energy. As a result of the thermonuclear reaction, huge numbers of high-energy fast neutrons were formed in the main thermonuclear module, which, in turn, initiated the fast fission nuclear reaction in the nuclei of the surrounding uranium-238, which would have added another 50 Mt of energy to the explosion, so that the estimated energy release of Tsar Bomba was around 100 Mt.

The test of such a complete three-stage 100 Mt bomb was rejected due to the extremely high level of radioactive contamination that would be caused by the fission reaction of large quantities of uranium-238. During the test, the bomb was used in a two-stage version. A. D. Sakharov suggested using nuclear passive material instead of the uranium-238 in the secondary bomb module, which reduced the bomb&#x27;s energy to 50 Mt, and, in addition to reducing the amount of radioactive fission products, avoided the fireball&#x27;s contact with the Earth&#x27;s surface, thus eliminating radioactive contamination of the soil and the distribution of large amounts of fallout into the atmosphere.

Many technical innovations were applied in the design of Tsar Bomba. The thermonuclear charge was made according to the &quot;bifilar&quot; scheme – the radiation implosion of the main thermonuclear stage was carried out from two opposite sides. These secondary charges produced X-ray compression of the main thermonuclear charge. For this, the second stage was separated into two fusion charges which were placed in the front and rear parts of the bomb, for which a synchronous detonation was required with a difference in initiation of no more than 100 nanoseconds. To ensure synchronous detonation of charges with the required accuracy, the sequencing unit of the detonation electronics was modified at KB-25 (now &quot;Federal State Unitary Enterprise &quot;NL Dukhov All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Automation&quot;)(VNIIA).

== Development of the carrier aircraft ==

The initial three-stage design of Tsar Bomba was capable of yielding approximately 100 Mt (approximately 3,000 times the power of the Hiroshima (15 kt) and Nagasaki (21 kt) bombs, combined); however, it was thought that this would have resulted in too much nuclear fallout, and the aircraft delivering the bomb would not have had enough time to escape the explosion. To limit the amount of fallout, uranium-238 in the tamper was replaced with lead. This eliminated fast fission reactions from the tamper by the fusion-stage neutrons, so that approximately 97% of the total yield resulted from thermonuclear fusion alone. As such, it was one of the &quot;cleanest&quot; nuclear bombs ever created, as most of the radioactive intensity of nuclear fallout is caused by the creation of fission products. There was a strong incentive for this modification, since most of the fallout from a test of the bomb would probably have descended on populated Soviet territory.

The first studies on &quot;Topic 242&quot; began immediately after Igor Kurchatov talked with Andrei Tupolev, then held in late 1954) Tupolev appointed his deputy for weapon systems, Aleksandr Nadashkevich, as the head of the topic. Subsequent analysis indicated that to carry such a heavy, concentrated load, the Tu-95 bomber carrying the Tsar Bomba needed to have its engines, bomb bay, suspension and release mechanisms extensively redesigned. The Tsar Bomba&#x27;s dimensional and weight drawings were passed in the first half of 1955, together with its placement layout drawing. The Tsar Bomba&#x27;s weight accounted for 15% of the weight of its Tu-95 carrier as expected. The carrier, aside from having its fuel tanks and bomb bay doors removed, had its BD-206 bomb-holder replaced by a new, heavier beam-type BD7-95-242 (or BD-242) holder attached directly to the longitudinal weight-bearing beams. The problem of how to release the bomb was also solved; the bomb-holder would release all three of its locks in a synchronous fashion via electro-automatic mechanisms as required by safety protocols.

A Joint Resolution of the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers (Nr. 357-28ss) was issued on 17 March 1956, which mandated that OKB-156 begin conversion of a Tu-95 bomber into a high-yield nuclear bomb carrier. These works were carried out in the Gromov Flight Research Institute from May to September 1956. The converted bomber, designated the Tu-95V, was accepted for duty and was handed over for flight tests, which including a release of a mock-up &quot;superbomb&quot;, were conducted under the command of Colonel S. M. Kulikov until 1959, and passed without major issues.

Despite the creation of the Tu-95V bomb-carrier aircraft, the test of the Tsar Bomba was postponed for political reasons: namely, Khrushchev&#x27;s visit to the United States and a pause in the Cold War. The Tu-95V during this period was flown to Uzyn, in today&#x27;s Ukraine, and was used as a training aircraft; therefore, it was no longer listed as a combat aircraft. With the beginning of a new round of the Cold War in 1961, the test was resumed. The Tu-95V had all connectors in its automatic release mechanism replaced, the bomb bay doors removed and the aircraft itself covered with a special, reflective white paint.

In late 1961, the aircraft was modified for testing Tsar Bomba at the Kuibyshev aircraft plant.

== Test ==
Nikita Khrushchev, the first secretary of the Communist Party, announced the upcoming tests of a 50-Mt bomb in his opening report at the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on 17 October 1961. Before the official announcement, in a casual conversation, he told an American politician about the bomb, and this information was published on 8 September 1961, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The Tsar Bomba was tested on 30 October 1961.

The Tupolev Tu-95V aircraft No. 5800302 carrying the bomb took off from the Olenya airfield, and flew to State Test Site No. 6 of the USSR Ministry of Defense on Novaya Zemlya with a crew of nine:

* Test pilot – Major Andrei Yegorovich Durnovtsev
* Lead navigator of tests – Major Ivan Nikiforovich Kleshch
* Second pilot – Captain Mikhail Konstantinovich Kondratenko
* Navigator-operator of the radar – Lieutenant Anatoly Sergeevich Bobikov
* Radar operator – Captain Alexander Filippovich Prokopenko
* Flight engineer – Captain Grigory Mikhailovich Yevtushenko
* Radio operator – Lieutenant Mikhail Petrovich Mashkin
* Gunner / radio operator – Captain Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Snetkov
* Gunner / radio operator – Corporal Vasily Yakovlevich Bolotov

The test was also attended by the Tupolev Tu-16 laboratory aircraft, no. 3709, equipped for monitoring the tests, and its crew:

* Leading test pilot – Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Fyodorovich Martynenko
* Second pilot – Senior Lieutenant Vladimir Ivanovich Mukhanov
* Leading navigator – Major Semyon Artemievich Grigoryuk
* Navigator-operator of the radar – Major Vasily Timofeevich Muzlanov
* Gunner / radio operator – Senior Sergeant Mikhail Emelyanovich Shumilov

Both aircraft were painted with special reflective paint to minimize heat damage. Despite this, Durnovtsev and his crew were given only a 50% chance of surviving the test.

The bomb, weighing , was so large ( long by in diameter) that the Tu-95V had to have its bomb bay doors and fuselage fuel tanks removed. The bomb was attached to an , parachute, which gave the release and observer planes time to fly about away from ground zero, giving them a 50 percent chance of survival. The bomb was released two hours after takeoff from a height of on a test target within Sukhoy Nos. The Tsar Bomba detonated at 11:32 (or 11:33; USGS earthquake monitors list the event as occurring at 11:33:31 ) Moscow Time on 30 October 1961, over the Mityushikha Bay nuclear testing range (Sukhoy Nos Zone C), at a height of ASL ( above the target) By this time the Tu-95V had already escaped to away, and the Tu-16 away. When detonation occurred, the shock wave caught up with the Tu-95V at a distance of and the Tu-16 at . After the shock wave reached the aircraft, the Tu-16 had its speed increased in a split second from 880 to 980 km/h, and dropped in the air due to the combination of the shock wave with exceptionally high air density drop immediately afterwards. However, both aircraft managed to recover and land safely. According to initial data, the Tsar Bomba had a nuclear yield of (exceeding what the design itself would suggest) and was overestimated at values all the way up to . Both aircraft had their frames burned-out black by the radiation in all parts exposed to the blast.

Although simplistic fireball calculations predicted it would be large enough to hit the ground, the bomb&#x27;s own shock wave bounced back and prevented this. The fireball reached nearly as high as the altitude of the release plane and was visible at almost away. The mushroom cloud was about high (nearly eight times the height of Mount Everest), which meant that the cloud was above the stratosphere and well inside the mesosphere when it peaked. The cap of the mushroom cloud had a peak width of and its base was wide.

A Soviet cameraman said: &quot;The clouds beneath the aircraft and in the distance were lit up by the powerful flash. The sea of light spread under the hatch and even clouds began to glow and became transparent. At that moment, our aircraft emerged from between two cloud layers and down below in the gap a huge bright orange ball was emerging. The ball was powerful and arrogant like Jupiter. Slowly and silently it crept upwards ... Having broken through the thick layer of clouds it kept growing. It seemed to suck the whole Earth into it. The spectacle was fantastic, unreal, supernatural.&quot;

== Test results ==
The explosion of Tsar Bomba, according to the classification of nuclear explosions, was an ultra-high-power low-air nuclear explosion.

* The flare was visible at a distance of more than . It was observed in Norway, Greenland and Alaska.
* The explosion&#x27;s mushroom cloud rose to a height of . The shape of the &quot;hat&quot; was two-tiered; the diameter of the upper tier was estimated at , the lower tier at . The cloud was observed from the explosion site.
* The blast wave circled the globe three times, with the first one taking 36 hours and 27 minutes.
* A seismic wave in the Earth&#x27;s crust, generated by the shock wave of the explosion, circled the globe three times.
* The atmospheric pressure wave resulting from the explosion was recorded three times in New Zealand: the station in Wellington recorded an increase in pressure at 21:57, on 30 October, coming from the north-west, at 07:17 on 31 October, from the southeast, and at 09:16, on 1 November, from the northwest (all GMT), with amplitudes of , , and respectively. The average wave speed is estimated at , or 9.9 degrees of the great circle per hour.
* Glass shattered in windows from the explosion in a village on Dikson Island.
* The sound wave generated by the explosion reached Dikson Island, but there are no reports of destruction or damage to structures even in the urban-type settlement of Amderma, which is to the landfall.
* Ionization of the atmosphere caused interference to radio communications even hundreds of kilometers from the test site for about 40 minutes. 
* Radioactive contamination of the experimental field with a radius of in the hypocenter area was no more than 1 milliroentgen / hour. The testers appeared at the explosion site 2 hours later; radioactive contamination posed practically no danger to the test participants.
*In the Norwegian border village of Kiberg, fishermen reported injured cod, and border guards reported having contracted cancer in large numbers over the following years, though the latter was never confirmed as being as a result of the bomb.

All buildings in the village of Severny, both wooden and brick, located from ground zero within the Sukhoy Nos test range, were destroyed. In districts hundreds of kilometres from ground zero, wooden houses were destroyed; stone ones lost their roofs, windows, and doors; and radio communications were interrupted for almost one hour. One participant in the test saw a bright flash through dark goggles and felt the effects of a thermal pulse at a distance of . The heat from the explosion could have caused third-degree burns away from ground zero. A shock wave was observed in the air at Dikson settlement away; windowpanes were partially broken for distances up to . Atmospheric focusing caused blast damage at even greater distances, breaking windows in Norway and Finland. Despite being detonated above ground, its seismic body wave magnitude was estimated at 5.0–5.25.

==Reactions==
Immediately after the test, several United States politicians condemned the Soviet Union. Prime Minister of Sweden Tage Erlander saw the blast as the Soviets&#x27; answer to a personal appeal to halt nuclear testing that he had sent the Soviet leader in the week prior to the blast. The British Foreign Office, Prime Minister of Norway Einar Gerhardsen, Prime Minister of Denmark Viggo Kampmann and others also released statements condemning the blast. Soviet and Chinese radio stations mentioned the US underground nuclear test of a much smaller bomb (possibly the &quot;Mink&quot; test) carried out the day prior, without mentioning the Tsar Bomba test.

== Consequences of the test ==

The creation and testing of a superbomb were of great political importance; the Soviet Union demonstrated its potential in creating a nuclear arsenal of great power (at that time, the most powerful thermonuclear charge tested by the United States, Castle Bravo, had been 15 Mt). After the Tsar Bomba test, the United States did not increase the power of its own thermonuclear tests and, in 1963 in Moscow, the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, Outer Space and Under Water was signed.

The main scientific result of the test was the experimental verification of the principles of calculation and design of multistage thermonuclear charges. It also confirmed the theory that there is no fundamental limit to the power of a thermonuclear charge. This fact had probably been first postulated in October 1949 (three years before the Ivy Mike test which utilized the Teller-Ulam design), when in the supplement to the official report of the General Advisory Committee of the US Atomic Energy Commission, nuclear physicists Enrico Fermi and Isidor Isaac Rabi stated that thermonuclear weapons can potentially have &quot;unlimited destructive power&quot;.

The explosive power of the bomb could have easily been raised by another 50 Mt by using a uranium-238 sheath instead of lead. It was consciously decided to replace the cladding material and thus decrease the yield in order to reduce radioactive fallout below an acceptable level.

The explosion is one of the cleanest in the history of atmospheric nuclear tests per unit of power. The first stage of the bomb was a uranium charge with a capacity of 1.5 Mt, which produced a large amount of radioactive fallout, but more than 97% of the explosion power was provided by a thermonuclear fusion reaction, which does not create a significant amount of radioactive contamination.

A 2015 expedition measuring the glaciers of Novaya Zemlya reported 65–130 times more radioactivity than the background in neighboring areas, due to nuclear testing, including Tsar Bomba.

Andrei Sakharov was one of the most prominent speakers against nuclear proliferation. He played a key role in signing the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty. Sakharov became an advocate of civil liberties and reforms in the Soviet Union. In 1973 he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and in 1974 was awarded the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, but was not allowed to leave the Soviet Union to collect it. His wife Yelena Bonner read his speech at the acceptance ceremony.

== Analysis ==

The Tsar Bomba is the single most physically powerful device ever deployed on Earth, the most powerful nuclear bomb tested and the largest human-made explosion in history. For comparison, the largest weapon ever produced by the US, the now-decommissioned B41, had a predicted maximum yield of . The largest nuclear device ever tested by the US (Castle Bravo) yielded because of an unexpectedly high involvement of lithium-7 in the fusion reaction; the preliminary prediction for the yield was from . The largest weapons deployed by the Soviet Union were also around (e.g., the SS-18 Mod. 3 warhead).

The weight and size of the Tsar Bomba limited the range and speed of the specially-modified bomber carrying it. Delivery by an intercontinental ballistic missile would have required a much stronger missile (the Proton started its development as that delivery system). It has been estimated that detonating the original design would have increased the world&#x27;s total fission fallout since the invention of the atomic bomb by 25%. It was decided that a full 100 Mt detonation would create a nuclear fallout that was unacceptable in terms of pollution from a single test, as well as a near-certainty that the release plane and crew would be destroyed before it could escape the blast radius.

The Tsar Bomba was the culmination of a series of high-yield thermonuclear weapons designed by the Soviet Union and the United States during the 1950s (e.g., the Mark 17 and B41 nuclear bombs).

== Practical applications ==
The Tsar Bomba was never intended to be a practical or mass-produced weapon; it was a single product, the design of which allowed reaching a power of 100 Mt. The test of a 50-Mt bomb was, among other things, a test of the performance of the product design for 100 Mt. However, there were several &quot;super-heavy&quot; ballistic missiles that were developed by the Soviet Union whose early impetus was at least partially, if not entirely, designed to give them a capability to use warheads in the 50-150 Mt range. These included:

* UR-500 – (warhead mass – 40 tons, virtually implemented as a carrier rocket – &quot;Proton&quot; – GRAU index – 8K82)
* N-1 – (warhead mass – , the development was reoriented into a carrier for the lunar program, the project was brought to the stage of flight design tests and closed in 1976, GRAU index – 11A52). 
* R-56 – (GRAU index – 8K67)

In the absence of a push for such high-yield weapons, all of these rocket programs were either used as launch vehicles for the Soviet space program, or cancelled.

== Films ==

* Footage from a Soviet documentary about the bomb is featured in &quot;Trinity and Beyond: The Atomic Bomb Movie&quot; (Visual Concept Entertainment, 1995), where it is referred to as the &quot;Russian monster bomb&quot;. The video has a few issues regarding incorrect facts: It states that the &quot;Tsar Bomba&quot; project broke the voluntary moratorium on nuclear tests. In fact, the Soviets had restarted their test program and broken the unilateral voluntary moratorium 30 days before &quot;Tsar Bomba&quot;, testing 45 times in that month. Since the moratorium was unilateral there was no legal obstacle. The US had declared their own one-year unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests and, as that year had expired, the US had already announced that it considered itself free to resume testing without further notice. Later it was stated that the US had not resumed testing at the time of the &quot;Tsar Bomba&quot; test. That was incorrect, as the US had in fact tested five times under Operation Nougat between the USSR&#x27;s ending of the moratorium on 1 October and the Tsar Bomba test on 30 October.
* &quot;World&#x27;s Biggest Bomb&quot;, a 2011 episode of the PBS documentary series &quot;Secrets of the Dead&quot; produced by Blink Films &amp; WNET, chronicles the events leading to the detonations of Castle Bravo and the Tsar Bomba.
* In connection with the celebration of 75 years of nuclear industry, Rosatom released a declassified Russian language documentary video of the Tsar Bomba test on YouTube in August 2020.

<text>John Nance Garner III (November 22, 1868 – November 7, 1967), known among his contemporaries as &quot;Cactus Jack&quot;, was the 32nd vice president of the United States, serving from 1933 to 1941, under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A member of the Democratic Party, Garner served as the 39th speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1931 to 1933, having been a U.S. representative from Texas from 1903 to 1933. Garner and Schuyler Colfax are the only politicians to have served as presiding officers of both chambers of the U.S. Congress as speaker of the House and vice president of the United States.

Garner began his political career as the county judge of Uvalde County, Texas. He served in the Texas House of Representatives from 1898 to 1902 and won election to represent Texas in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1902. He represented Texas&#x27;s 15th congressional district from 1903 to 1933. Garner served as House Minority Leader from 1929 to 1931, and was elevated to Speaker of the House when Democrats won control of the House following special elections in 1931 (Republicans actually retained control immediately after the 1930 elections, but lost as several seats shifted parties).

Garner sought the Democratic presidential nomination in the 1932 presidential election, but agreed to serve as Roosevelt&#x27;s running mate at the 1932 Democratic National Convention. He and Roosevelt won the 1932 election and were reelected in 1936. A conservative Southerner, Garner opposed the sit-down strikes of the labor unions and the New Deal&#x27;s deficit spending. At the same time, he was considered highly effective in the passage of New Deal legislation, with Roosevelt relying greatly on Garner&#x27;s wealth of political friendships and legislative skills to pilot New Deal legislation through Congress. Unlike vice presidents before him, Garner also had an active, non-ceremonial role in the U.S. Cabinet. He broke with Roosevelt in 1937 over a range of issues, especially the centralization of power in the federal government. Garner again sought the presidency in the 1940 presidential election, but Roosevelt won the party&#x27;s nomination at the 1940 Democratic National Convention and chose Henry A. Wallace as his running mate.

==Early life and family==
Garner was born on November 22, 1868, in a mud-chinked log cabin in Red River County, Texas, to John Nance Garner Jr. and Sarah Guest Garner. That cabin no longer exists, but the large, white, two-story house where he was raised survives, at 260 South Main Street in Detroit, Texas.

Garner attended Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, for one semester before dropping out and returning home. He studied law at the firm of Sims and Wright in Clarksville, Texas, was admitted to the bar in 1890, and began practice in 1896 in Uvalde, Texas.

In 1893, Garner entered politics, running for county judge of Uvalde County, the county&#x27;s chief administrative officer. Garner was opposed in the primary by a woman—Mariette Rheiner Garner, a rancher&#x27;s daughter, whom, after the election, he courted and married in 1895. Garner won, and with the Democratic nomination seen as tantamount to election in the post-Civil War Solid South, was elected county judge and served until 1896.

==Texas politics==
Garner was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1898 and reelected in 1900. During his service, the legislature selected a state flower for Texas. Garner fervently supported the prickly pear cactus, and thus earned the nickname &quot;Cactus Jack&quot;. The bluebonnet was ultimately chosen.

Garner also drafted a resolution that would have divided Texas into five states. It passed the Texas House but was vetoed by the governor.

In 1901, Garner voted for the poll tax, a measure passed by the Democratic-dominated legislature to make voter registration more difficult and reduce the number of minority and poor voters on the voting rolls. This disfranchised most minority voters until the 1960s, and ended challenges to Democratic power; Texas became in effect a one-party state.

Garner traveled parts of southern Texas controlled by the &quot;patrón&quot; system, currying political favor with the land bosses who exercised near-complete control of the local people and local elections. His &quot;patrón&quot; allies created a gerrymandered district for him, the , shaped in a narrow strip reaching south to include tens of thousands of square miles of rural areas.

==House of Representatives==
Garner was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1902. He was elected from the district 14 subsequent times, serving until 1933. His wife was paid and worked as his private secretary during this period. Throughout his career he maintained allegiance to the white landowners who controlled the voting booths in South Texas. He regarded his Mexican voting base as &quot;inferior and undesirable as U.S. citizens.&quot;

Garner was chosen to serve as minority floor leader for the Democrats in 1929, and in 1931 as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, when the Democrats became the majority.

==Vice presidency (1933–1941)==
In 1932, Garner ran for the Democratic presidential nomination. It had become evident that Franklin D. Roosevelt, the governor of New York, was the strongest of several candidates, but although he had a solid majority of convention delegates, he was 87.25 votes short of the two-thirds required for nomination. After Garner cut a deal with Roosevelt, thus allowing Roosevelt to win the nomination, Garner became his vice-presidential candidate.

Garner was re-elected to the 73rd Congress on November 8, 1932, and on the same day was also elected Vice President of the United States. On February 8, 1933, then-vice president Charles Curtis announced the election of his successor, House Speaker Garner, while Garner was seated next to him on the House dais. He was the second man, Schuyler Colfax being the first, to serve as both Speaker of the House and president of the Senate. Garner was re-elected vice president with Roosevelt in 1936, serving in that office in total from March 4, 1933, to January 20, 1941.
Like most vice presidents in this era, Garner had little to do and little influence on the president&#x27;s policies. He famously described the vice presidency as being &quot;not worth a bucket of warm piss&quot; (for many years, this quote was bowdlerized as &quot;warm spit&quot;). Historian Patrick Cox traces the possible origin of this quote to a 1960 conversation with Lyndon B. Johnson, who consulted Garner on John F. Kennedy&#x27;s offer to run for vice president.

During Roosevelt&#x27;s second term, Garner&#x27;s previously warm relationship with the president quickly soured, as Garner disagreed sharply with him on a wide range of important issues. Garner supported federal intervention to break up the Flint sit-down strike, supported a balanced federal budget, opposed the Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937 to &quot;pack&quot; the Supreme Court with additional judges, and opposed executive interference with the internal business of the Congress.

During 1938 and 1939, numerous Democratic party leaders urged Garner to run for president in the 1940 presidential election. Garner identified as the champion of the traditional Democratic Party establishment, which often clashed with supporters of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. The Gallup poll showed that Garner was the favorite among Democratic voters, based on the assumption that Roosevelt would defer to the longstanding two-term tradition and not run for a third term. &quot;Time&quot; characterized him on April 15, 1940:

Some other Democrats did not find him appealing. In congressional testimony, union leader John L. Lewis described him using tetrameter as &quot;a labor-baiting, poker-playing, whiskey-drinking, evil old man&quot;.Garner declared his candidacy. Roosevelt refused to say whether he would run again. If he did, it was highly unlikely that Garner could win the nomination, but Garner stayed in the race anyway. He opposed some of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies, most notably those related to wooing labor, and on principle, opposed presidents serving third terms. However, Garner was also credited with steering a number of important bills through Congress in the crisis atmosphere of Roosevelt&#x27;s first one hundred days in office and his relationship with the President would not become strained until Roosevelt&#x27;s second term, when the Vice President&#x27;s hopes of balancing the budget and paring New Deal programs faded. He was also active in Roosevelt&#x27;s Cabinet meetings on national policy and legislative strategy, which also resulted in the effective transformation of the previously ceremonial office of the U.S. vice president. However, the president&#x27;s &quot;court-packing&quot; plan of 1937 widened the rift with Garner, and the final blow in their relationship came when the president attempted to purge opposition Democratic members of Congress in the 1938 elections. Also, by 1940, Garner had come to support federal legislation against lynching (although probably more out of political opportunism rather than for principled reasons) which Roosevelt opposed.

At the Democratic National Convention, Roosevelt engineered a &quot;spontaneous&quot; call for his renomination, and won on the first ballot. Garner received only 61 votes out of 1,093. Roosevelt chose Henry A. Wallace to be his vice-presidential running mate.

== Post vice-presidency (1941–1967) ==
Garner left office on January 20, 1941, ending a 46-year career in public life. He retired to his home in Uvalde for the last 26 years of his life, where he managed his extensive real estate holdings, spent time with his great-grandchildren, and fished. Throughout his retirement, he was consulted by active Democratic politicians and was especially close to Roosevelt&#x27;s successor, Harry S. Truman. His papers are held at the Briscoe Center for American History at UT Austin, which also operates Garner&#x27;s former home as a historical site.

On the morning of Garner&#x27;s 95th birthday, November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy called to wish him a happy birthday. This was several hours before Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. Dan Rather stated that he visited the Garner ranch that morning to film an interview with Garner.

==Personal life and death==

Garner and Mariette Rheiner met and began dating after the primary election in 1893. They married in Sabinal, Texas, on November 25, 1895. Mariette served as her husband&#x27;s secretary throughout his congressional career, and as Second Lady of the United States during her husband&#x27;s tenure as vice president. Their son, Tully Charles Garner (1896–1968), became a banker and businessman. Garner died of a coronary occlusion on November 7, 1967, 15 days before his 99th birthday. Garner remains the longest-lived Vice President of the United States in history.

==Legacy==

Garner State Park, located north of Uvalde, bears his name, as does Garner Field just east of Uvalde. The women&#x27;s dormitory at Southwest Texas Junior College in Uvalde bears his wife&#x27;s name. John Garner Middle School, located in San Antonio&#x27;s North East Independent School District, is also named after him.

Garner and Schuyler Colfax, vice president under Ulysses S. Grant, are the only two vice presidents to have been Speaker of the House of Representatives prior to becoming vice president. As the vice president is also the president of the Senate, Garner and Colfax are the only people to have served as the presiding officer of both houses of Congress.

<text>Francisco de Orellana (; 1511 – November 1546) was a Spanish explorer and conquistador. In one of the most improbably successful voyages in known history, Orellana managed to sail the length of the Amazon, arriving at the river&#x27;s mouth on 24 August 1542. He and his party sailed along the Atlantic coast until reaching Cubagua Island, near the coast of Venezuela.

Orellana founded the city of Guayaquil in what is now Ecuador, and died during a second expedition on the Amazon.

==Background==
Born in Trujillo in western Spain (various birth dates, ranging from 1490 to 1511, are still quoted by biographers), Orellana was a close friend and possibly a relative of Francisco Pizarro, the Trujillo-born conquistador of Peru (his cousin, according to some historians). He traveled to the New World (probably in 1527). Orellana served in Nicaragua until joining Pizarro&#x27;s army in Peru in 1533, where he supported Pizarro in his conflict with Diego de Almagro (1538). After the victory over De Almagro&#x27;s men, he was appointed governor of La Culata. He re-established the town of Guayaquil, previously founded by Pizarro and repopulated by Sebastián de Belalcázar. During the civil war, he sided with the Pizarros and was Ensign General of a force sent by Francisco Pizarro from Lima to aid Hernando Pizarro. He was granted land at Puerto Viejo, on the coast of Ecuador.

==First exploration of the Amazon River==
In 1540 Gonzalo Pizarro arrived in Quito as vice governor and was charged by Francisco Pizarro, his older paternal half-brother, with an expedition to locate the &quot;Land of Cinnamon&quot;, thought to be somewhere to the east. Orellana was one of Gonzalo Pizarro&#x27;s lieutenants during his 1541 expedition east of Quito into the South American interior. In Quito, Gonzalo Pizarro collected a force of 220 Spaniards and 4000 natives. At the same time, as second in command, Orellana was sent back to Guayaquil to gather troops and horses. Pizarro left Quito in February 1541, just before Orellana arrived with his 23 men and horses. Orellana hurried after the main expedition, eventually contacting them in March. However, by the time the expedition had left the mountains, 3000 natives and 140 Spanish had died or deserted.

On reaching the Coca River (a tributary of the Napo), a brigantine, the &quot;San Pedro&quot;, was constructed to ferry the sick and supplies. Gonzalo Pizarro ordered him to explore the Coca River and return after finding the river&#x27;s end. When they arrived at the confluence with the Napo River, his men threatened to mutiny if they did not continue. On 26 December 1541, he agreed to be elected chief of the new expedition and conquer new lands in the king&#x27;s name. Orellana (with the Dominican Gaspar de Carvajal who chronicled the expedition) and 50 men set off downstream to find food. Unable to return against the current, Orellana waited for Pizarro, finally sending back three men with a message, and started constructing a second brigantine, the &quot;Victoria&quot;. Pizarro had in the meantime returned to Quito by a more northerly route, by then with only 80 men left alive.

After leaving the village on the Napo, Orellana continued downstream to the Amazon. The 49 men began to build a bigger ship for river navigation. During their navigation on Napo River, they were threatened constantly by the Omaguas. They reached the Negro River on 3 June 1542 and finally arrived on the Amazon River.

At a longitude of about 69°W, Orellana and his men were involved in a skirmish with Machiparo&#x27;s natives and were chased downstream. Continuing downstream, they consecutively passed the Rio de la Trinidad (possibly the Rio Juruá), the Pueblo Vicioso, the Rio Negro (named by Orellana), the Pueblo del Corpus, the Pueblo de los Quemados, and the Pueblo de la Calle at about 57°W. There they entered the territory of the Pira-tapuya.

The name &#x27;Amazon&#x27; is said to arise from a battle Francisco de Orellana fought with a tribe of Tapuyas. The women of the tribe fought alongside the men, as was the custom among the tribe. Orellana described the river as &quot;the river of the Amazons&quot;, referring to the mythical Amazons of Asia described by Herodotus (see &quot;The Histories&quot; [4.110–116]) and Diodorus in Greek legends. A skirmish with these South American warrior women reportedly took place on 24 June 1542 while Orellana was approaching the Trombetus River, in the neighborhood of the Ilha Tupinambarama at the junction with the River Madeira.

At about 54°W they stopped for 18 days to repair the boats, and finally reached the Atlantic Ocean on 26 August 1542, and checked the boats for seaworthiness. While coasting toward Guiana, the brigs were separated until reunited at Nueva Cadiz on Cubagua island off the coast of Venezuela. The &quot;Victoria&quot;, carrying Orellana and Carvajal, passed south around Trinidad and was trapped in the Gulf of Paria for seven days, finally reaching Cubagua on 11 September 1542. The &quot;San Pedro&quot; sailed north of Trinidad and reached Cubagua on 9 September.

==Second expedition and death==
=== Preparations ===
From Cubagua, Orellana decided to return to Spain to obtain from the Crown the governorship over the discovered lands, which he named New Andalusia. After a difficult navigation, he touched first the shores of Portugal. The king received him in a friendly way and made him an offer to go back to the Amazon under a Portuguese flag. Orellana&#x27;s exploration produced an international issue. According to the Treaty of Tordesillas, the majority of the Amazon River should belong to Spain. However, the mouth should be ruled by Portugal. Orellana refused the Portuguese offer and went to Valladolid.

After nine months of negotiations, Prince Philip II appointed him governor of New Andalusia on February 13, 1544. After captivating the Spanish court with tales and alleged exaggerations of his voyage down the Amazon, Orellana obtained a commission to conquer and settle Nueva Andalucia. The charter established that he should explore and settle the Amazonian lands with 300 men and 100 horses, and found two cities, one in the mouth and another in the basin&#x27;s interior, Manaus.

The commission was accepted on 18 February 1544. However, preparations for the voyage were frustrated by unpaid debts, Portuguese spies, and internal wranglings. Sufficient funds were raised through the efforts of Cosmo de Chaves, Orellana&#x27;s stepfather. However, the problems were compounded by Orellana&#x27;s decision to marry a very young and poor girl, Ana de Ayala, whom he intended to take with him (along with her sisters). Orellana&#x27;s creditors relented and allowed him to sail only on the arrival of a Portuguese spy fleet at Seville. On reaching Sanlucar he was detained again, the authorities having discovered a shortfall in his complement of men and horses, and that large numbers of his crew were not Spanish. On 11 May 1545, Orellana (in hiding on one of his vessels) surreptitiously sailed out of Sanlucar with four ships and disappeared from view.

=== Expedition ===
On 11 May 1545, he left Spain with four ships, supplies to build two riverboats, perhaps 300 men, at least 24 horses, and his young wife. Before leaving land, he obtained from a farm some cattle, pigs, and chickens, which he salted. In the open sea, he waylaid a caravel and looted its supplies. At the end of May, he reached Tenerife and spent three months there putting his ships in order. He then sailed to the Cape Verde Islands where an epidemic killed 98 of his men and 50 or 60 deserted. With this loss, he abandoned one of his ships after salvaging what he could. He left about the middle of November. The crossing was difficult, and one of his ships became separated and was never seen again. With it went 77 men, 11 horses, and supplies to build one riverboat. He lost several anchors and had to replace them with cannons.

He reached the Brazil coast, sailed a hundred leagues until he found fresh water in the sea, which he assumed came from the Amazon. He landed on 20 December 1545 with two ships, 11 thin horses, and perhaps 100 men. Since the natives were friendly and there was plenty of food, his men suggested that they stop and rest and build the riverboat. Orellana overruled them and set off to find the main branch of the Amazon five days later. After sailing more than 300 miles he made camp and started building the riverboat. This took from January to March. They were forced to cannibalize the smaller of the two ships. The natives were hostile, there was little food in the area, and they had to eat all their dogs and horses. Fifty-seven men died.

Orellana sent the newly built boat off to find food, but it returned with no food and several men dead of hunger or wounds. He set off with the remaining ship and the riverboat. After traveling 75 miles southeast, the ship was wrecked on a riverbank. Orellana continued with the boat, leaving many men at the shipwreck camp. After nearly a month, he returned to the shipwreck, reporting that he had gone 500 miles and not found the main river. Orellana was now in poor shape, both physically and mentally. He set off again with the boat. Seventeen of his men were wounded by arrows. According to his wife, he died &quot;from illness and grief.&quot; The survivors went downriver to the sea where they were driven by the South Equatorial Current to the Spanish base at Margarita Island west of Trinidad.

After Orellana left the shipwreck camp, the 28 or 30 men there began building a boat from the wrecked ship, which took more than three months. The boat was ill-built and leaky. Some indigenous people guided them to &quot;a place where the Amazon splits into three arms&quot;. Finding no sign of Orellana, they went downriver. Ten men jumped ship, preferring life with the natives to a leaking boat. Reaching the sea, the current carried them northwest. In late November, the 18 survivors reached Margarita Island, where they met the other 25 survivors and Orellana&#x27;s wife.

*Orellana Province, Ecuador
*Francisco de Orellana, Maynas, Loreto, Peru
* The Amazon River was once called the Orellana River

==Historical chronicles==

Gaspar de Carvajal, the chaplain of the first expedition, wrote a chronicle &quot;Relación del nuevo descubrimiento del famoso río Grande que descubrió por muy gran ventura el capitán Francisco de Orellana&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of the new discovery of the famous Great river discovered by great good fortune by Captain Francisco de Orellana&quot;) which was partly reproduced in Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés&#x27;s &quot;Historia general y natural de las Indias&quot;, initially published in 1526 but continually revised until the author&#x27;s death in 1557, who included in addition statements by Orellana and some of his men. Carvajal&#x27;s manuscript was published in 1894 by the Chilean historian José Toribio Medina, preceded by a biography of Carvajal, in his book &quot;Descubrimiento del río de las Amazonas&quot;.

The BBC documentary &quot;Unnatural Histories&quot; presents evidence that Carvajal&#x27;s chronicle, rather than being a hugely exaggerated fantasy as previously thought, was correct in its observations that a civilization was flourishing along the Amazon in the 1540s. It is believed that the civilization was later devastated by the spread of smallpox and other diseases from Europe. The evidence to support this claim comes from the discovery of numerous geoglyphs dating from between 1 and 1250 AD, and &quot;terra preta&quot; resulting from indigenous activities. Some five million people may have lived in the Amazon region in 1500 in dense riverbank settlements such as that at Marajó, and inland. By 1900 the population had fallen to one million, and by the early 1980s it was fewer than 200,000.

==In popular culture==

A modern retelling of Orellana and his crew&#x27;s epic journey, with source material primarily provided by Carvajal, is written in Buddy Levy&#x27;s &quot;River of Darkness&quot;.

De Orellana&#x27;s voyages served as partial inspiration for the film &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot; (1972). An earlier script, penned by director Werner Herzog, also deliberately included De Orellana in the movie, but he was ultimately left out.

De Orellana&#x27;s role in the search for &quot;El Dorado&quot; also forms part of the plot of the film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; (2008).

William Ospina&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;El país de la canela&quot; (&quot;The Cinnamon Country&quot;) includes a novelized version of Orellana&#x27;s trip.

One of the campaigns of &quot;Age of Empires II: The Forgotten&quot; is called &quot;El Dorado&quot; and is about the quest of Francisco de Orellana and Francisco Pizarro to find &quot;El Dorado&quot;, the legendary Lost City of Gold, thought to be hidden somewhere in the vast Amazon rainforest. The campaign is based on De Orellana&#x27;s first exploration.
