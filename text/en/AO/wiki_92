<text>Golders Green is an area in the London Borough of Barnet in England. It began as a medieval small suburban linear settlement near a farm and public grazing area green, and dates to the early 19th century. Its bulk forms a late 19th century and early 20th century suburb with a commercial crossroads. The rest is of later build. It is centred approximately 6 miles (9 km) north west of Charing Cross on the intersection of Golders Green Road and Finchley Road.

It was founded as a medieval hamlet in the large parish of Hendon, Middlesex. The parish was heavily superseded by Hendon Urban District in 1894 and by the Municipal Borough of Hendon in 1932, abolished in 1965. In the early 20th century, it grew rapidly in response to the opening of a tube station of the London Underground, adjacent to the Golders Green Hippodrome which was home to the BBC Concert Orchestra for many years. The area has a wide variety of housing and a busy main shopping street, Golders Green Road.

It is known for its large Jewish population as well as for being home to the largest Jewish kosher hub (located west of Hoop Lane after the rail bridge) in the United Kingdom, which attracts many Jewish tourists.

==History==

The name Golders comes from a family named Godyere who lived in the area, and Green alludes to the manorial common at a cross roads next to which the settlement was built. Golders Green has been a place in the parish and manor of Hendon since around the 13th century. The earliest reference to the name of the adjacent district of &quot;Temple Fortune&quot; is on John Rocque&#x27;s map of 1754, which also shows what is now Golders Green Road as Groles Green. However the name Temple Fortune reveals a much earlier history. It is likely that the name refers to the Knights of St John, who had land here (c. 1240). Fortune may be derived from a small settlement (tun) on the route from Hampstead to Hendon. Here a lane from Finchley, called Ducksetters Lane (c. 1475), intersected. It is likely that the settlement was originally the Bleccanham estate (c. 10th century). By the end of the 18th century Temple Fortune Farm was established on the northern side of Farm Close.

The building of Finchley Road (c. 1827) replaced Ducksetters Lane as a route to Finchley, and resulted in the development of a small hamlet. Hendon Park Row (c. 1860s) is of this period, and consisted of around thirty small dwellings built by a George Stevens, which were, with two exceptions, demolished around 1956. A small dame school and prayer house run by Anglican deaconesses existed in the 1890s and 1900s, and developed to become St. Barnabas (1915). Along Finchley Road were a number of villas (c. 1830s), joined by the Royal Oak public house (c. 1850s). By the end of the 19th century there were around 300 people living in the area, which included a laundry and a small hospital for children with skin diseases. The principal industry was brick making.

In 1895, Golders Green Jewish Cemetery was established adjacent to Hoop Lane, with the first burial in 1897. Golders Green Crematorium was opened in 1902 (although much of it was built after 1905). A significant moment in Temple Fortune&#x27;s development into a suburban area occurred in 1907, when transport links were vastly improved by the opening of Golders Green Underground station.

Although the area had been served by horse-drawn omnibuses (since at least the 1880s) and later motor buses (from 1907), the tram line of 1910, connecting Finchley Church End with Golders Green Station, led to the development of the area west of Finchley Road. The establishment of Hampstead Garden Suburb brought major changes to the area east of Finchley Road. Temple Fortune Farm was demolished and along the front of the road the building of the Arcade and Gateway House (c. 1911) established the Hampstead Garden Suburb&#x27;s retail district.

Both the Golders Green Hippodrome, former home of the BBC Concert Orchestra, and the police station opened in 1913. The now-demolished Orpheum Theatre (1930) was intended to rival the Hippodrome in Golders Green.

==Geography==

For local elections &quot;Golders Green&quot; ward covers the north and west of the area; Childs Hill the south to the centre and &quot;Garden Suburb&quot;, named after Hampstead Garden Suburb: most of the east. Councillors are elected from across 21 wards. Nationally it votes for the MP for seat of Finchley and Golders Green, which encompasses the parts of the NW11 and NW2 postcode districts it contains. The same boundaries are used for the Golders Green, Childs Hill and Garden Suburb wards of the Metropolitan Police Service.

It is about to above sea level.

The area is adjacent to the Heath Extensions part of Hampstead Heath.

==Demography==
Golders Green is often referred to as a Jewish area, and 2021 Census data shows that 49.9% (7,358 of 14,744) of residents identified as Jewish, making it the epicentre of the largest Jewish population in Europe along with its surrounding areas, including Hampstead, Hendon and Finchley within the Borough of Barnet, which is home to 55,000 Jews, the highest percentage Jewish population in any Borough of the United Kingdom.

Ethnically, the Golders Green ward was 64% White (43% British, 21% Other, 1% Irish). Indians, Other Asians and Black Africans made up 5% each, while 6% claimed &#x27;Any other ethnic group&#x27;.

=== Jewish community ===
There has been a prominent Jewish community in Golders Green since the early 20th century following the building of the station at the end of the Hampstead railway. Golders Green United Synagogue was the first purpose built synagogue, with its foundation stone laid on 16 October 1921. The Jewish community took root after Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, with the first German Jewish immigrants forming the Golders Green Beth Hamedrash. Soon after, Galician Jewish immigrants formed other synagogues. With it came the formation of Jewish schools such as Menorah Primary School before the onset of World War II.

There are close to fifty kosher restaurants and eateries under rabbinical supervision in Golders Green, and more than 40 synagogues throughout the area continuing into neighbouring Hendon, as well as 30 Jewish schools (some in outlying areas owing to space restriction), many of them independent.

The Jewish community of Hendon and Golders Green is viewed as one by many in the community there, as they share the schooling system as well as rabbinical guidance and synagogue affiliations.

== Places of worship ==
=== Churches ===

The Anglican parish church of St. Alban the Martyr in North End Road was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, and in 1933 replaced the original eponymous church, on the site, which is now the parish hall. The latter was built in 1910 and made a parish church in 1922.

St Edward the Confessor, a Roman Catholic church, was built in 1915 and consecrated in 1931. A Carmelite monastery was established in Bridge Lane in 1908 and sold in 2007.

There is a Greek Orthodox cathedral on Golders Green Road, and a Coptic Orthodox church, both having been Anglican churches for most of the 20th century. The Greek Orthodox church was built in 1914.

The Golders Green Unitarian Church, built in 1925 on Hoop Lane, is Grade II listed; Historic England singles out for mention a &quot;notable temera mural by Ivon Hitchens&quot;, among other works. The congregation seceded from Rosslyn Hill Unitarian Chapel (Hampstead) in 1903 but took a generation to build its own place of worship. St Ninian&#x27;s Presbyterian Church on Helenslea Avenue was built in 1911 by T. P. Figgis, noted for designing stations on the Northern line. The congregation merged with Golders Green Methodist Church (now Trinity Church, Hodford Road) in 1979. The building found new life as a Hindu temple, but was decommissioned in 2013.

=== Synagogues ===
There are several synagogues in the area. The first, Golders Green United Synagogue (Dunstan Road), started in 1915 and its current building in Dunstan Road opened in 1922. The Golders Green Beth Hamedrash opened in Golders Green in 1934, moving to the Riding in 1956. The Sassover Beis Hamedrash Helenslea Avenue moved to Golders Green from the East End in 1939 as well as the Beis Yissochor Dov (Hager&#x27;s) currently in Highfield Avenue and the Hendon Adass on Brent Street.

The Beth Shmuel Synagogue in 1942 in Oakfields Road and relocated at 169–171 Golders Green Road in 1945 and is one of the most prominent synagogues in North West London, with Grand Rabbi Elchonon Halpern its longest serving Rabbi for 72 years up until his passing in 2015. In about 1960 the Eastern Jewish Community established the Ohel David Eastern Synagogue at the Lincoln Institute, the former site of the Golders Green Beth Hamedrash. The Machzike Hadath Synagogue moved to Golders Green in the 1970s, opening its present building in 1983.

=== Other religious buildings ===
The former Golders Green Hippodrome theatre became an El Shaddai International Christian Centre in 2007 and then an Islamic centre in 2017, and now is a Hillsong Church.

==Community facilities==

Golders Hill Park, adjoining the West Heath of Hampstead Heath, is a formal park, which includes a small (free) zoo, a walled horticultural garden, pinetum, duckponds, a water garden and a very popular café. During the summer, children&#x27;s activities are organised and there is often live music on the bandstand. Close to the park, also adjoining the West Heath is the Hill, a formal garden with an extensive and imposing pergola.

Nearby Golders Green Crematorium has an extensive garden with features such as a special children&#x27;s section and a pond, in keeping with the distinct Italianate air.

==Appearances in popular culture==

The area is the setting of the humorous short story &quot;The Ghoul of Golders Green&quot; (&quot;May Fair&quot;, 1925) by Michael Arlen.

In chapter three of the 1932 book “Brave New World,” Aldous Huxley wrote, “Eight hundred Simple Lifers were mowed down by machine guns at Golders Green.”

In his 1946 book &quot;The Great Divorce,&quot; C.S. Lewis has a character from Golders Green. Sarah Smith and her husband are the last characters to enter the novel. She appears with great pomp and circumstance, arrayed in splendor and arriving behind a procession complete with music. She is beautiful and one of the &quot;great ones&quot; in heaven, but on earth had led an anonymous life in Golders Green.

Golders Green was alluded to in the phrase &quot;half as gold as green&quot; in the 1948 BBC radio sketch &quot;Balham: Gateway to the South&quot;, written by Frank Muir and Denis Norden. It was also an allusion to John Burgon&#x27;s 1845 poem &quot;Petra&quot;, in which Petra is called &quot;a rose-red city, half as old as time&quot;. &quot;Half as old as time&quot; was itself a quotation from Samuel Rogers&#x27; &quot;Italy&quot; (1822–28). The sketch was popularised through a 1958 recording by Peter Sellers.

George Harrison recorded an unreleased track titled &quot;Going Down to Golders Green&quot; during the sessions for his acclaimed triple album &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. The song was inspired by his visits to members of the pop group Badfinger, who lived at 7 Park Avenue, off North End Road, near the borders of Golders Hill Park.

The first posthumous (1997) album release of the music of Pete Ham of the pop group Badfinger was titled &quot;7 Park Avenue&quot;, named after the address of Badfinger&#x27;s band residence in Golders Green. A second posthumous (1999) album release was titled &quot;Golders Green&quot;.

<doc id="94018" wikidata="Q1942855" url="?curid=94018" title="Goodmayes">
<text>Goodmayes is an area in Ilford, in East London, England. It is a ward of the London Borough of Redbridge, eleven miles north-east of Charing Cross, and forms part of both the Romford and Ilford post towns. Historically part of Essex, it was part of the Municipal Borough of Ilford until 1965 when it was incorporated into Greater London.

==History==
The name &quot;Goodmayes&quot; and &quot;Goodmaistrete&quot; is recorded in 1456, and the name is likely to be associated with the family of John Godemay who was referred to in a document of 1319. A farm called &quot;Goodmath&quot; is recorded on the &quot;Chapman and Andre&quot; 1 inch to one mile map of Essex from 1777. Barley Lane is believed to be named after Dorothy Barley, the sister of Henry Barley, Dorothy was the last Abbess of nearby Barking Abbey (elected 1527).

Goodmayes was part of the Chadwell ward of the ancient parish of Barking, Essex. In 1888 the Chadwell and Great Ilford wards of Barking became a new parish of Ilford. This became Ilford Urban District in 1894 and was the Municipal Borough of Ilford from 1926 to 1965. The London Borough of Redbridge was formed in 1965 from Ilford and other areas. Councillors for the electoral ward of Goodmayes were first elected in 1964.

Goodmayes was largely undeveloped until the end of the 19th century, when large scale suburban development took place as London expanded. Most of the area here and in neighbouring Seven Kings was only built up between 1898 and 1910 by the developer A. C. Corbett who used new stations on the Great Eastern Railway to promote the new suburbs. Goodmayes station was built in 1901. Since then, little has changed in the area, although there have been, and still are, regeneration projects taking place within the area. However, the lines of Edwardian terraced housing continue to dominate the district with relatively few more recent additions.

Former extensive railway sidings near Goodmayes Station were closed in the 1970s and later redeveloped for retail purposes. A large Tesco store and a branch of Wickes now occupy the site. On the A118 road, a Homebase store occupied the site until it was demolished in early 2023.

==Facilities==

Goodmayes Park, an area of open space containing a lake, basketball and tennis courts, is located here. It once contained a bandstand and a boathouse but these are no longer available. Another local park is named Barley Lane Park.

Brookside, based on Barley Lane, is, according to &#x27;the quality network for inpatient CAMHS services&#x27; (QNIC), an adolescent unit that provides a high standard of care. It comprises Brookside Main, Interact Outreach service and the Brookside High Dependency Unit.

Barley Lane Primary School is located on Barley Lane. 

On Goodmayes Lane there is a clinic known as &#x27;Mayesbrook Clinic&#x27; however it is now abandoned.

==Local media==
Goodmayes Hospital &amp; King George Hospital, Ilford had its own in-house Hospital Radio service. The service was operated volunteers as Goodmayes Hospital Radio Association (GHR) a registered charity and began broadcasting in 1975. 

In 2015 the celebrated its 40th anniversary of broadcasting to patients of Goodmayes Hospital and the North East London NHS Foundation Trust. However, a burst radiator forced the station off-air causing £30,000 of damage. The Association merged the radio service with Bedrock Radio (a registered charity) and service was resumed.

Bedrock Radio provide a wider community health (hospital radio) service across East London, South Essex and immediate surrounding areas.

==Notable people==
Actor Cardew Robinson was born in Goodmayes on 14 August 1917. He is best remembered for character and cameo roles, the best known being the fakir in &quot;Carry On Up the Khyber&quot;. He died in Roehampton in 1992.

Sir Ian Holm was born at Goodmayes Hospital on 12 September 1931 to Scottish parents, Jean Wilson Holm and James Harvey Cuthbert. His mother was a nurse and his father was a psychiatrist and superintendent of the West Ham Corporation Mental Hospital, as Goodmayes Hospital was then known. Cuthbert was one of the pioneers of electric shock therapy for treating mental illness. Ian Holm was created a CBE in 1989 and was knighted in 1998.

==Local Scout groups==
Goodmayes is home to various local Scout groups, most notably 4th Goodmayes, who are located on Barley Lane next to St Pauls Church. Established for 90 years, their home is traditionally called the Gaffery, which has had many different buildings in the past but they have remained on the same site. The group&#x27;s current home is incorporated within the St Paul&#x27;s Community Centre, which opened in 2005.
Ages start from 6 up to 14, with the three sections called the Beavers, the Cubs and the Scouts.
In 2010, they opened up their own Explorer Unit for 14- to 18-year-olds and incorporated it into a Young Leader Scheme, providing trained and qualified young leaders for other Scouting sections to assist their leaders.
The 7th Goodmayes scout group was established in 2006 and has over 100 members. It is the first scout group in East London to be run by Muslims. It has accomplished many tasks and activities, including visiting the House of Lords, Buckingham Palace, and partaking in numerous water sports activities including rafting, sailing, kayaking and canoeing. The group also aims to contribute to the community through activities such as tree planting and a sponsored walk for Comic Relief, raising over 1000 pounds.
Other activities include archery, wall climbing and camping.

<text>Greenford () is a large town in the London Borough of Ealing in West London, London, England, lying west from Charing Cross. It has a population of 46,787 inhabitants, or 62,126 with the inclusion of Perivale.

Greenford is served by Greenford Station (London Underground Central Line and Greenford branch of the Great Western Railway mainline service). South Greenford mainline station (on the A40 Western Avenue, also on the Greenford branch of the GWR) is actually in Perivale. Neither station is in Greenford Town Centre (Greenford Broadway), which instead is served by many local buses.

Nearby places include Yeading, Hanwell, Perivale, Southall, Northolt, Ealing, Sudbury and Sudbury Hill. The most prominent landmark in the suburb is Horsenden Hill, above sea level.

Greenford covers a large area, including the two miles of Greenford Road, giving it three localities: North Greenford, Greenford Green, and Greenford Broadway – this is also reflected in the names of the electoral wards. Though a separate &quot;town&quot; within the borough of Ealing, the Royal Mail includes Perivale within the Greenford post area and as such the two share the UB6 postcode.

==Toponymy==
The name is first recorded in 848 as &quot;Grenan forda&quot;. It is formed from the Old English &#x27;grēne&#x27; and &#x27;ford&#x27; and means &#x27;place at the green ford&#x27;. Greenford was known as Great Greenford in order to distinguish it from Little Greenford, which is now known as Perivale (Greenford and Perivale, though different places, still share the UB6 postal code). The affixes &#x27;Magna&#x27; and &#x27;Parva&#x27; have also been used to denote the difference.

==History==
Greenford was an ancient parish in the historic Elthorne Hundred, county of Middlesex.

=== Industrial ===
Greenford is considered to be birthplace of the modern organic chemical industry, as it was at William Perkin&#x27;s chemical factory in North Greenford, by the Grand Union Canal, that the world&#x27;s first aniline dye was discovered in March 1856. Perkin called his amazing discovery &#x27;mauveine&#x27;. Today there is a blue plaque marking the spot in Oldfield Lane North, just south of the Black Horse public house. Local anecdote says that Queen Elizabeth I would only eat bread made from wheat grown in Greenford, and until 2013/14 Greenford was the home to the Hovis factory. The former Rockware glassworks on the canal is commemorated by Rockware Avenue. Greenford formed part of Greenford Urban District from 1894 to 1926 and was then absorbed by the Municipal Borough of Ealing.

===J. Lyons and Co.===
Post First World War, tea blender and food manufacturer J. Lyons and Co. were looking for a secondary site on which to expand production beyond Cadby Hall, Hammersmith. In 1921 they bought the first piece of an eventual site, due to its location close to good transport links from both the Grand Union Canal and the Great Western Railway&#x27;s Great Western Main Line, and the West Coast Main Line and onwards to the Midlands at Willesden Junction.

The factory officially opened in July 1921, with the first single-storey buildings known as &quot;Zig-Zag&quot; due to their northern light-aligned windows allowing maximum light into the production area. There were steam and electrical power plants on site, which powered both the plant as well as the staff canteen and medical facilities, accessible to all plant employees and their dependents. Transport docks and a canal basin had been developed, allowing shipment of tea and coffee directly from London Docks into HM Customs excise controlled bonded warehouses. The extensive onsite railway infrastructure allowed precise positioning of heavy raw goods into the factory, as well as the extraction of finished product. Lyons bought their own steam shunters to move wagons between the GWR exchange sidings and the factory system.

Lyons quickly became Greenford&#x27;s biggest employer. A later pioneer in electronic machines and computing, Lyons deployed the latest factory automation technology, making Greenford a showplace that was regularly visited by the media, academics, competitors and royalty, with more than one visit by King George V and Queen Mary. In the 1950s, the site developed the breakfast cereal Ready Brek. Areas of the site not initially developed for factory use were landscaped, with many trees planted. As the factory developed these diminished, particularly after the development of the Lyons Maid Bridge Park factory in the 1950s, and the new administration block in 1971.

After the merger of Lyons with Allied Bakeries in the 1980s, and the focus of the new Allied Domecq business to focus on spirits, with the sell-off of the businesses associated with the factory, the need for the facility dwindled. Redeveloped from 1998, today it is known as Lyon Way Industrial Estate.

===Art and culture===
Five hundred yards north east from William Perkin&#x27;s dye factory was a triangular field in which he kept horses. On this ground was built the Oldfield Tavern public house, which became a popular venue for a rock group called the Detours, who met a drummer there called Keith Moon. On Thursday 20 February 1964 they were introduced to the audience of the Oldfield Tavern as the Who. (The tavern has not survived, however, and has since been replaced by a small block of flats and a Texaco petrol station).

<text>Gunnersbury is an area of West London, England.

==Toponymy==

The name &quot;Gunnersbury&quot; originally meant &quot;Gunner&#x27;s (Gunnar&#x27;s) fort&quot;, and is a combination of an old Scandinavian personal name + Middle English -&quot;bury&quot;, meaning, &quot;fort&quot;, or &quot;fortified place&quot; .

==Development==

Gunnersbury consists mainly of pre-war housing of a variety of types, including flats, terrace, semi detached, and detached houses, some of which are ex-local authority built.

The defining symbol of Gunnersbury is the 18-storey high BSI (British Standards Institution) building on Chiswick High Road. Between 1966 and 1992 the block housed a divisional headquarters of IBM UK. Below this building Gunnersbury station serves the Richmond branch of the District line and the London Overground&#x27;s Mildmay line to Stratford.

On the north side of the High Road is The Gunnersbury, formerly the John Bull pub, built in 1853, with a billiards saloon built a little later. It became a music venue, visited by bands including The Who.

In August 1921, London General Omnibus Company established a bus overhaul facility off Chiswick High Road. It incorporated a Training School with a bus skidpan. In 1989, London Transport closed the works. In 2001 the site was redeveloped as the Chiswick Business Park with 12 medium density office buildings. It houses companies including SBS Broadcasting Networks, CBS News, Technicolor, Discovery Channel Europe, Intelsat, Singapore Airlines, Qantas, Foxtons, and a Virgin Active health club.

Immediately to the east is Gunnersbury Triangle nature reserve. An area of woodland, it supports many species of birds, plants, and animals. It has free admission and its entrance is on the south of Bollo Lane, a few yards from Chiswick Park tube station.

Just to the north of Gunnersbury Triangle, Chiswick Park Footbridge connects Gunnersbury&#x27;s Chiswick Business Park with Chiswick Park tube station. It was designed by Expedition Engineering and Useful Studios.

Gunnersbury lends its name to a nearby secondary school, formerly a grammar school, in Brentford. Gunnersbury Catholic School is a boys-only Catholic comprehensive with a co-educational sixth form. It used to be located on Gunnersbury Avenue and it backed on to Gunnersbury Park. Since 1984, it has been located in The Ride, Brentford.

In 1886, Gunnersbury was given its own parish church, dedicated to Saint James. The church stood on Chiswick High Road, near Chiswick Roundabout. The church was decommissioned just over a century later, in 1987, and demolished soon afterwards. The parish was united with that of St Paul&#x27;s, Brentford.

<doc id="94028" wikidata="Q374431" url="?curid=94028" title="The Tigger Movie">
<text>The Tigger Movie is a 2000 American animated musical comedy drama film produced by Walt Disney Television Animation with animation production by Walt Disney Animation Japan. The film was written and directed by Jun Falkenstein from a story by Eddie Guzelian. It is the second theatrical &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; film following &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; (1977). It features Pooh&#x27;s sidekick Tigger searching for his family tree and other Tiggers like himself.

The film was the first feature-length theatrical &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; film that was not a collection of previously released shorts. It is also the first in the original films in which Tigger is voiced entirely by Jim Cummings (in addition to Pooh) following the retirement of Tigger&#x27;s original voice actor Paul Winchell in 1999. Winchell was originally cast as Tigger but was dropped after the studio considered his voice to be too raspy. Cummings had previously shared the role with Winchell since 1989 and provided his singing voice in most later projects with Winchell as the character&#x27;s speaking voice.

The film features original songs from the Sherman Brothers. Originally, the film was slated for a direct-to-video release in 2001, until then–Disney CEO Michael Eisner heard the Sherman Brothers&#x27; songs and decided to release the film in theaters worldwide a year early.

&quot;The Tigger Movie&quot; released in the United States on February 11, 2000, by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $96.2 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film in the &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; franchise until it was surpassed by &quot;Christopher Robin&quot; (2018).

The film received three nominations on the Annie Awards, including the Annie Award for Directing in a Feature Production, the Annie Award for Voice Acting in a Feature Production, and the Annie Award for Music in a Feature Production.

== Plot ==

In the Hundred Acre Wood, Tigger searches for someone to bounce with him, but finds that his friends are busy preparing for the upcoming winter. During his search for a playmate, Tigger inadvertently destroys Eeyore&#x27;s house with a boulder. Tigger attempts to help his friends remove the boulder, but inadvertently destroys Rabbit&#x27;s mechanical pulley system in the process. Rabbit and the rest of Tigger&#x27;s friends admonish him for his reckless nature, hurting his feelings. Tigger&#x27;s closest friend Roo sees Tigger&#x27;s sadness and asks him if he has any family members of his own. Tigger becomes fascinated by the concept and decides to search for his family, hoping to finally be within a similar company.

Misunderstanding advice from Owl, Tigger and Roo begin searching for his family tree, believing it to be a giant tree covered in stripes and with many Tiggers upon it. After the search fails, Roo suggests that Tigger write a letter to his family, and he does so. He lets the wind carry it away with hopes that it will reach his family but receives no response after days of waiting and begins to lose hope. Tigger&#x27;s friends sympathetically decide to write him a letter and they sign it &quot;your family&quot;. Upon receiving the letter, Tigger erroneously believes that his supposed family is intending to visit him and organizes a large party in preparation. Unable to tell Tigger the truth about the letter, Roo encourages his friends to disguise themselves as Tiggers and attend his party.

Tigger&#x27;s friends later arrive at his house. He falls for his friends&#x27; disguises until Roo&#x27;s mask falls off after an attempt to imitate a complex bounce that Tigger had taught him earlier fails. Feeling betrayed by his friends&#x27; deception, Tigger sets out into a blizzard in search of his real family, prompting the group to pursue him. Tigger eventually finds an immense tree that the snow has whitened with stripes, convincing him that it is the family tree he had sought, but he is saddened to find no one there. Tigger&#x27;s friends try persuading him to come home, but an argument between them causes an avalanche to occur. Tigger brings his friends to higher ground but fails to save himself before the snow sweeps him away. Remembering Tigger&#x27;s complex bounce, Roo successfully performs it and rescues Tigger. After the avalanche subsides, the group reveal their authorship of the letter, causing Tigger to realize that his friends are his real family, and he later throws a new party in honor of them.

== Cast ==

* Jim Cummings as Tigger and Winnie the Pooh
* Nikita Hopkins as Roo
* Ken Sansom as Rabbit
* John Fiedler as Piglet
* Peter Cullen as Eeyore
* Andre Stojka as Owl
* Kath Soucie as Kanga
* Tom Attenborough as Christopher Robin
* John Hurt as The Narrator

== Production ==
Jun Falkenstein directed the film, in her own feature length debut, following her work on &quot;A Winnie the Pooh Thanksgiving&quot;. The film began production in April 1998. Many scenes, totaling up to 60% of the film, were completed by Walt Disney Animation Japan. Drawing inspiration from the end of &quot;Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too&quot; when Tigger agrees to not bounce anymore, the film crafted a fuller character arc that &quot;[showed] a range of emotions&quot; for Tigger.

=== Voice cast ===
Paul Winchell, the original voice of Tigger, was originally cast to voice Tigger for the film, which was then titled &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Family Tree&quot;. During Spring 1998, Winchell participated in a single recording session for the film. However, he was dropped from the project after the studio found his voice too raspy. The role was given to Jim Cummings, who was already voicing Winnie the Pooh for the film, and had voiced Tigger on various Disney television shows and for Disney consumer products. When the Disney Imagineers heard about Winchell&#x27;s dismissal, they hired him to perform the voice of Tigger for &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; attraction at the Magic Kingdom, which opened a year before &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot;&#x27;s release; it was Winchell&#x27;s final performance before his retirement from acting in 1999 and his death in 2005.

=== Music ===
The songs for &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot; were written by Robert and Richard Sherman who had not written a feature for Disney in over 28 years. Their last fully original feature film score was for the Oscar nominated film, &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; which was released in 1971. &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot; would also be the last film work for the Sherman Brothers. Robert B. Sherman died in London on March 6, 2012 at the age of 86 and Richard M. Sherman died of &quot;age-related illness&quot; at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, on May 25, 2024 at the age of 95. Originally slated for video or television release, the demo cut of the score was so well received by then Disney CEO, Michael Eisner, that the project&#x27;s priority level moved up to feature theatrical release. The score of the film is composed by Harry Gregson-Williams with additional music by Klaus Badelt and Steve Jablonsky and the score was conducted by Nick Glennie-Smith.

All the songs were original ones created for the film except for &quot;The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers&quot; which was originally written in 1968 for the featurette, &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot; (released in 1968). That song was also by the Sherman Brothers. The &quot;punch line&quot; of the song: &quot;But the most wonderful Thing About Tiggers is I&#x27;m the only one...&quot; provides the basis of &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot;″s storyline. The vast majority of the songs, including &quot;Someone Like Me&quot;, &quot;Whoop-de-Dooper Bounce&quot;, &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Lullabee&quot;, and &quot;Round My Family Tree&quot; were performed by Jim Cummings, while &quot;How to Be a Tigger&quot; was performed by the cast.

&quot;Your Heart Will Lead You Home&quot; was the last song written for the film and is a collaborative effort between the Sherman Brothers and singer Kenny Loggins. Richard Sherman described the song as &quot;a song about the picture, as opposed to songs of the picture.&quot; It marks the only time the trio worked together on a song.

The original theatrical trailer for the film featured the song &quot;Semi-Charmed Life&quot; by alternative band Third Eye Blind. A Disney spokeswoman said that she was not aware of the sexual content within the song&#x27;s lyrics.

===Songs===
Original songs performed in the film include:

== Release ==
The film was originally intended to be released straight-to-video, akin to most Disney spin-offs and sequels, but was instead bumped up to a theatrical release.

=== Marketing ===
Disney released a teaser trailer for &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot; in August 1999, during theatrical screenings of &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;. The teaser was later attached to theatrical screenings of &quot;The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland&quot;, &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; and &quot;Stuart Little&quot;. The teaser trailer was included on the Winnie the Pooh &quot;Seasons of Giving&quot; home video release.

=== Theatrical ===
After a Hollywood red carpet premiere on February 6, 2000 at El Capitan Theatre, the film was released theatrically on February 11, 2000. The movie was on screens for 23 weeks.

=== Home media ===
&quot;The Tigger Movie&quot; was originally released on August 22, 2000, on both VHS and DVD. The film was later re-released on a 2-disc DVD edition on August 4, 2009 to coincide with its 10th anniversary and includes two bonus episodes of The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh &quot;King of the Beasties&quot; and &quot;Tigger’s Houseguest.&quot; The 2-disc release includes a DVD and a digital copy. The film was also re-released as a &quot;Bounce-a-rrrific&quot; special edition on Blu-ray on August 21, 2012.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
The film opened at number 4 at the US box office making $9.4 million in its opening weekend. The film was a box office success, earning $45,554,533 in the United States and Canada and a further $50,605,267 overseas, resulting in a worldwide gross of $96,159,800. Its budget is estimated at between $15 million and $30 million. On its initial release on home video, it earned $90 million.

=== Critical reception ===
The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 63% of critics gave the film positive reviews on 72 reviews with a 5.9 rating. The site&#x27;s consensus states, &quot;&quot;The Tigger Movie&quot; may lack the technological flash and underlying adult sophistication of other recent animated movies, but it&#x27;s fun and charming.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 53 out of 100, based on twenty three critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

William Thomas of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film a three out of four stars, saying: &quot;And while the one-dimensional nature of the plot is unlikely to entertain anyone over the age of 11, the end result certainly includes enough pre-pubescent prerequisites to ensure that the furry fella will never bounce alone.&quot; Common Sense Media gave the film a three out of five stars and said: &quot;Tigger&#x27;s bouncy quest will appeal to younger viewers.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
== In other media ==
=== Sequels ===
Disney released various theatrical and direct-to-videos in the years that followed. There were two theatrical animated films: &quot;Piglet&#x27;s Big Movie&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Heffalump Movie&quot; in 2005. Two direct-to-video animated films also followed, &quot;Springtime with Roo&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Heffalump Halloween Movie&quot; in 2005.

<text>Hampstead () is an area in London, England, which lies northwest of Charing Cross, forming the northwest part of the London Borough of Camden, a borough in Inner London. It borders Highgate and Golders Green to the north, Belsize Park to the south and is surrounded from the northeast by Hampstead Heath, a large, hilly expanse of parkland.

Hampstead is known for its intellectual, artistic, liberal, and literary associations. It contains a number of listed buildings, such as Burgh House, Kenwood House, the Spaniard&#x27;s Inn, and the Everyman cinema. With some of the most expensive housing in London, Hampstead has had many notable residents, both past and present, including King Constantine II of Greece and his wife Queen Anne Marie, Helena Bonham Carter, Agatha Christie, T. S. Eliot, Jon English, Sigmund Freud, Stephen Fry, Ricky Gervais, Jim Henson, George Orwell, Harry Styles and Elizabeth Taylor. As of 2004, Hampstead has been home to more Prime Ministers, and contains more millionaires within its boundaries, than any other area of the United Kingdom.

Inhabited since at least when the Anglo-Saxons ruled Britain, Hampstead is one of the oldest areas in London. From the 17th century it became popular as a resort away from the capital, especially for the affluent. The areas has been contained within many metropolitan governments since the 13th century, ending with the dissolution of the Metropolitan Borough of Hampstead into the London Borough of Camden in 1965. Since then, it has become a major tourist destination within Camden, owing to its many historical sites and high street.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name comes from the Anglo-Saxon words &quot;ham&quot; and &quot;stede&quot;, which means, and is a cognate of, the Modern English &quot;homestead&quot;.

===To 1900===
Archeological findings from Hampstead Heath, including Mesolithic flint tools, pits, postholes, and burnt stones, indicate a hunter-gatherer community around 7000 BCE. Objects like cinerary urns and grave goods discovered near Well Walk, dating back to 70–120 CE, suggest the possibility of a Roman settlement or road in the vicinity.

Early records of Hampstead can be found in a grant by King Ethelred the Unready to the monastery of St. Peter&#x27;s at Westminster (AD 986), and it is referred to in the Domesday Book (1086) as being in the Middlesex hundred of Ossulstone. Outlying hamlets developed at West End and North End. In addition Pond Street formed the southern limit of the settlement for many centuries.

The growth of Hampstead is generally traced back to the seventeenth century. Trustees of the Well started advertising the medicinal qualities of the chalybeate waters (mineral water impregnated with iron) in 1700. A pump room and assembly room were established on Well Walk, supplied by water from springs in nearby Well Road. Elegant housing was built in New End road, New End Square and Church Row. Although Hampstead Wells was initially most successful and fashionable, its popularity declined in the nineteenth century due to competition with other fashionable London spas. The spa was demolished in 1882, although a water fountain was left behind.

Hampstead started to expand following the opening of the North London Railway in the 1860s (now the London Overground with passenger services operated by Transport for London), and expanded further after the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway opened in 1907 (now part of London Underground&#x27;s Northern line) and provided fast travel to central London.

Much luxurious housing was created during the 1870s and 1880s, in the area that is now the political ward of Frognal &amp; Fitzjohns. Much of this housing remains to this day.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, a number of notable buildings were created including:
* Hampstead Underground station (1907), the deepest station on the Underground network
* Isokon building (1932)
* Hillfield Court (1932)
* 2 Willow Road (1938)
* Swiss Cottage Central Library (1964)
* Royal Free Hospital (mid-1970s)

Cultural attractions in the area include the Freud Museum, Keats House, Kenwood House, Fenton House, the Isokon building, Burgh House (which also houses Hampstead Museum), and the Camden Arts Centre. The large Victorian Hampstead Town Hall was recently converted and extended as an arts centre.

On 14 August 1975 Hampstead entered the UK Weather Records with the &quot;Highest 155-min total&quot; rainfall at 169 mm. As of November 2008 this record remains.

The average price of a property in Hampstead was £1.5 million in 2018.

==Geography==

Hampstead became part of the County of London in 1889 and in 1899 the Metropolitan Borough of Hampstead was formed. The Town Hall on Haverstock Hill, which was also the location of the Register Office, can be seen in newsreel footage of many celebrity civil marriages. In 1965, the metropolitan borough was abolished and its area merged with that of the Metropolitan Borough of Holborn and the Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras to form the modern-day London Borough of Camden.

For some, the area represented by Hampstead today consists principally of the (electoral) wards of Hampstead Town and Frognal &amp; Fitzjohns; others espouse a broader definition, encompassing South Hampstead, Belsize Park and West Hampstead.

===Climate===
==Politics==

Hampstead is part of the Hampstead and Kilburn constituency, formed at the 2010 general election. It was formerly part of the Hampstead and Highgate constituency.

Since July 2022 the area has been represented on Camden Council by Conservative Party councillor Stephen Stark and Liberal Democrat councillor Linda Chung.

===Hampstead Liberalism===
The area has a significant tradition of educated liberal humanism, sometimes referred to (often disparagingly) as &quot;Hampstead Liberalism&quot;. In the 1960s, the figure of the Hampstead Liberal was notoriously satirised by Peter Simple of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; in the character of Lady Dutt-Pauker, an immensely wealthy aristocratic socialist whose Hampstead mansion, Marxmount House, contained an original pair of Bukharin&#x27;s false teeth on display alongside precious Ming vases, neo-constructivist art, and the complete writings of Stalin. Michael Idov of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; stated that the community &quot;was the citadel of the moneyed liberal intelligentsia, posh but not stuffy.&quot; As applied to an individual, the term &quot;Hampstead Liberal&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;champagne socialist&quot; but carries some of the same connotations. The term is also rather misleading.

As of 2018, the component wards of Hampstead (South Hampstead, Frognal, Hampstead Town and Belsize) have mixed representation. Frognal ward elects two Conservative councillors, Belsize ward elects three Liberal Democrat councillors, South Hampstead elects three Labour councillors, while Hampstead Town is represented by one Liberal Democrat and one Conservative councillor.

South Hampstead is a competitive Labour and Conservative marginal, and Belsize is competitive between the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, whereas Frognal is a safe Conservative ward. Hampstead Town (including the area of Hampstead Village and South End Green) has seen a number of tightly fought Conservative and Liberal Democrat contests, and the ward has had mixed representation in recent decades. 

===Brexit referendum===
During the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 75% of voters across the London Borough of Camden voted to remain in the EU. Following the result many commentators used Hampstead as an archetype of the type of area that preferred to remain in the EU. This point was often made in alliterative contrast to poor post-industrial northern towns such as Hartlepool and Hull, that preferred to leave.

==Places of interest==


===Sites===
To the north and east of Hampstead, and separating it from Highgate, is London&#x27;s largest ancient parkland, Hampstead Heath, which includes the well-known and legally-protected view of the London skyline from Parliament Hill. The Heath, a major place for Londoners to walk and &quot;take the air&quot;, has three open-air public swimming ponds; one for men, one for women, and one for mixed bathing, which were originally reservoirs for drinking water and the sources of the River Fleet. The bridge pictured is known locally as &#x27;The Red Arches&#x27; or &#x27;The Viaduct&#x27;, built in fruitless anticipation of residential building on the Heath in the 19th century.

Local activities include major open-air concerts on summer Saturday evenings on the slopes below Kenwood House, the FT Weekend Festival, book and poetry readings, fun fairs on the lower reaches of the Heath, period harpsichord recitals at Fenton House, Hampstead Scientific Society and Hampstead Photographic Society.

The largest employer in Hampstead is the Royal Free Hospital, Pond Street, but many small businesses based in the area have international significance. George Martin&#x27;s AIR recording studios, in converted church premises in Lyndhurst Road, is a current example, as Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop was before it relocated to California.

The area has some remarkable architecture, such as the Isokon building in Lawn Road, a Grade I listed experiment in collective housing, once home to Agatha Christie, Henry Moore, Ben Nicholson and Walter Gropius. It was recently restored by Notting Hill Housing Trust.

===Churches and synagogues===
*Christ Church – Hampstead Square, NW3 1AB

St Stephen&#x27;s Rosslyn Hill (Church of England) was built in 1869 by Samuel Sanders Teulon on the Pond Street side of Hampstead Green. Deconsecrated in 1978 and stripped of much of its assets it was boarded up and subsequently invaded by squatters. In 1998 it was leased to the St Stephen&#x27;s Restoration and Preservation Trust which, after 11 years of fundraising and grants returned it to the community as a centre for education, weddings, public meetings and social celebrations together with occasional classical music concerts. Winning an English Heritage award for the restoration of buildings at risk, the website www.ststephenstrust.co.uk has further information.

* Catto Gallery – 100 Heath Street, Hampstead, London NW3 1DP
* Gilden&#x27;s Art Gallery, 74, Heath Street, London NW3 1DN
* Zebra One Gallery,– 1 Perrin&#x27;s Court, Hampstead, London, NW3 1QX

===Public houses===
Hampstead is well known for its traditional pubs, such as The Holly Bush, gas-lit until recently; the Spaniard&#x27;s Inn, Spaniard&#x27;s Road, where highwayman Dick Turpin took refuge; The Old Bull and Bush in North End; and The Old White Bear (formerly Ye Olde White Bear). Jack Straw&#x27;s Castle, on the edge of the Heath near Whitestone Pond, has now been converted into residential flats. Others include:
*The Flask – 14 Flask Walk, Hampstead, London, NW3 1HE
*Freemasons Arms – 32 Downshire Hill, Hampstead, London, NW3 1NT
*The Duke of Hamilton – 23–25 New End, Hampstead, London, NW3 1JD

*The Garden Gate – 14 South End Road, Hampstead, London, NW3 2QE
*The Wells Tavern – 30 Well Walk, Hampstead, London NW3 1BX

===Restaurants===
Hampstead has served as a testing ground for a number of cafes and restaurants that later became successful chains. Those include Giraffe World Kitchen, Gail&#x27;s and &#x27;Bagel Street&#x27;. As a consequence, Hampstead has an eclectic mix of restaurants ranging from French to Thai. After over a decade of controversy and legal action from local residents, McDonald&#x27;s was finally allowed to open in Hampstead in 1992, after winning its right in court, and agreeing to a previously unprecedented re-design of the shop front, reducing the conspicuousness of its facade and logo, It closed in November 2013. Popular local eateries also include street food vendors, such as La Creperie de Hampstead, which is often frequented by domestic and global celebrities.

===Schools===
===Film locations===
Hampstead&#x27;s rural feel lends itself for use in film, a notable example being &quot;The Killing of Sister George&quot; (1968) starring Beryl Reid and Susannah York. The opening sequence has Reid&#x27;s character June wandering through the streets and alleyways of Hampstead, west of Heath Street, around The Mount Square. The Marquis of Granby pub, in which June drinks at the opening of the film, was actually The Holly Bush, at 22 Holly Mount. Another example is &quot;The Collector&quot; (1965), starring Terence Stamp and Samantha Eggar, where the kidnap sequence is set in Mount Vernon.

Some scenes from &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; (1981) are shot on Hampstead Heath, Well Walk and Haverstock Hill.

More recently Kenwood House is the set of the &quot;film-within-the-film&quot; scene of &quot;Notting Hill&quot; (1999). Outdoor scenes in &quot;The Wedding Date&quot; (2005), starring Debra Messing, feature Parliament Hill Fields on the Heath, overlooking west London. Parliament Hill also features in &quot;Notes on a Scandal&quot; (2006) together with the nearby areas of Gospel Oak and Camden Town. &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; (1994) features the old Hampstead Town Hall on Haverstock Hill. The film &quot;Scenes of a Sexual Nature&quot; (2006) was filmed entirely on Hampstead Heath, covering various picturesque locations such as the &#x27;Floating Gardens&#x27; and Kenwood House.

A musical specifically focusing on the area, &quot;Les Bicyclettes de Belsize&quot; (1968), tells the story of a young man&#x27;s cycle journey around Hampstead. After crashing into a billboard poster, he falls in love with the fashion model depicted on it. In February 2016, principal photography for Robert Zemeckis&#x27; war film &quot;Allied&quot; starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard, began with the family home located on the corners of Christchurch Hill and Willow Road in Hampstead.

Cruella de Vil Mansion (Sarum Chase) is on the West Heath Road in movies 101 Dalmatians (1996.) and 102 Dalmatians (2001.)

==Demography==
The 2021 census showed that the population of Hampstead Town ward was 77.7% white (46.7% British, 28% Other, 2.4% Irish). The largest non-white group, Asian, claimed 8.9%. The religious data of the area showed that 32.6% was Christian, 37.9% irreligious and 11% Jewish. 2.7% of the population was unemployed and seeking work; this compared to 5.1% for the wider borough.
==Transport==

=== Rail and Tube ===
Hampstead station is on one underground line, the Northern Line which has connections to other lines at Camden Town and Kings Cross &amp; St Pancras stations and Embankment among others.

The London Overground (Mildmay line) also runs through Hampstead Heath and Finchley Road &amp; Frognal.

Stations in Hampstead include:
* Belsize Park 
* Finchley Road 
* Finchley Road &amp; Frognal 
* Hampstead 
* Hampstead Heath 
* Swiss Cottage 

All stations are in London fare zone 2, except Hampstead, which is in both zones 2 and 3. Hampstead station serves the north western part of the wider district, near Hampstead&#x27;s traditional centre. All the other three stations in the area are located to the south.

In the 1860s, the Metropolitan and St John&#x27;s Wood Railway was authorised to build a branch line from Swiss Cottage to Hampstead with its terminus to be located at the junction of Flask Walk, Well Walk and Willow Road. Financial difficulties meant that the project was cancelled in 1870.

=== Bus ===
There is a major bus terminus near South End Green in Hampstead (near the Royal Free Hospital), served by London Buses routes London Buses route 1. Routes 46, 268, C11, and N5 also serve the Royal Free Hospital.

Hampstead tube station and High Street are served by routes 46, 268, 603, and N5. Route 210 runs along the northernmost rim of Hampstead, stopping at Jack Straw&#x27;s Castle.

Finchley Road is served by routes 13, 113, 187, 268, C11, and N113.

=== Cycling ===
Cycling infrastructure in Hampstead is poor. In early 2016, Transport for London (TfL) consulted with the public on a new &quot;Cycle Superhighway&quot; (CS11) between Swiss Cottage and the West End, which provide an unbroken, predominantly traffic-free cycle route from Hampstead to Central London. The scheme was cancelled following court action from the City of Westminster in 2018.

There are bus lanes along the A41/Finchley Road that cyclists are allowed to use.

A shared-use path runs from Parliament Hill to Jack Straw&#x27;s Castle/Highgate through the centre of Hampstead Heath.

=== Road ===
The A41/Finchley Road passes north–south through Hampstead. The road links the area directly to Marylebone and Oxford Street to the south. The route runs northbound to Golders Green, Brent Cross, the M1 motorway, and Watford.

The A502/Hampstead High Street runs from Camden Town in the south, through Hampstead, to Golders Green and Hendon in the north-west.

===Nearest places===
The Royal Free Hospital and A&amp;E is in Hampstead.
==Notable residents==

 Hampstead has long been known as a residence of the intelligentsia, including writers, composers, ballerinas and intellectuals, actors, artists and architects – many of whom created a bohemian community in the late 19th century. After 1917, and again in the 1930s, it became base to a community of &quot;avant garde&quot; artists and writers and was host to a number of émigrés and exiles from the Russian Revolution and Nazi Europe.

===Blue plaques===
There are at least 60 English Heritage blue plaques in Hampstead commemorating the many diverse personalities that have lived there.

==Local newspapers==
The local newspapers, as of 2014, were the &quot;Hampstead and Highgate Express&quot;—known locally as the &quot;Ham and High&quot;—and the free &quot;Camden New Journal&quot;. The area is also home to the left-wing Labour magazine &quot;Tribune&quot; and the satirical magazine &quot;Hampstead Village Voice&quot;.

<text>Hampton is a suburb of Greater London on the north bank of the River Thames, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, England, and the historic county of Middlesex. Hampton is bounded by Bushy Park to the east (and to the north of St Albans Riverside facing Tagg&#x27;s Island), the suburbs of Hampton Hill and Fulwell to the north, green belt to the west, and the Thames to the south.

Historically, the manor of Hampton included Hampton Court Palace (and Bushy Park), Hampton Hill, and Hampton Wick (which are now known collectively as &quot;The Hamptons&quot;). Originally settled in Saxon times, the manor was awarded to the Norman lord Walter of Saint-Valéry following the 1066 Norman Conquest, passed by his heirs to the Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem in 1237, and acquired by Henry VIII following the Act of Supremacy 1534 (26 Hen. 8. c. 1). The enclosure of common land in 1811 and rapid growth of 19th-century London saw agricultural fields converted to market gardens, and later nurseries. The construction of the Hampton Water Treatment Works in the late 1850s and early 1860s, and the opening of the Shepperton Branch Line to London Waterloo in 1864, led to a steady growth in the population of Hampton, and fields in south Hampton near the station being converted to suburban housing in the late 19th century and interwar period. Refrigeration, air freight and cheaper overseas labour ultimately rendered the market gardens and nurseries uncompetitive and derelict, and after a lengthy planning process the Nurserylands estate was established in north Hampton in the 1980s.

Today Hampton is a primarily residential suburb of Greater London. The population at the 2021 Census was 27,307 (20,000 excluding Hampton Hill).

==History==

=== Pre-history ===
The River Thames was displaced southwards to its present course through Berkshire and London following the Anglian glaciation c. 450,000 BCE. The local geology comprises Kempton Park Gravel above London Clay, on which the Thames deposits fertile, well-drained alluvial soils, making it an attractive area for human habitation and settlement.

There is evidence of small hunter-gatherer communities in the Thames Valley in the Palaeolithic period, who would have hunted migrating animal herds (reindeer and horse) depending on seasonal conditions. Hand-axes and a flint from that era have been recovered from sites in Hampton, indicating the presence of human activity as early as the Wolstonian Stage.

The resettlement of Britain following the Last Glacial Maximum and the start of the Holocene is evidenced in Hampton and surrounding areas by the artefacts (predominantly flintwork) of Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, who would have favoured the diversity of habitats and food resources offered by rivers and their floodplains for settlement and resource procurement. Three Mesolitihic tranchet axes were discovered during construction of the Hampton Waterworks.

Evidence of Neolithic and Bronze Age settlement activity in the area is widespread, during a period when the level of the River Thames would have been significantly lower than at present. Finds on Garrick&#x27;s Ait (Neolithic stone axe), Hurst Park (Neolithic pits), and Platt&#x27;s Eyot (early Bronze Age axe); and the excavation in 1854 of a significant Bronze Age barrow in Bushy Park (containing the cremated remains and offerings of a local chieftain) indicate the transition to settled agriculture.

Before the Roman invasion of Britain, the Hampton area was occupied by the Catuvellauni, a Celtic tribe with its centre of government at &quot;Watamestede&quot;, near modern-day St Albans. There is little archaeological evidence of Roman activity in the Hampton area (which was concentrated around the river crossing at Kingston-upon-Thames), except for a small collection of finds at Hampton Hill, a corn drier in Hurst Park, and field boundaries laid out to Roman proportions in what would become Bushy Park.

=== Anglo-Saxon Hampton and the Norman Conquest ===
Following the end of Roman rule the Hampton area would have been on the fringes of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Mercia, in territory which came to be known as &quot;Middlesex&quot;. The settlement of Hampton first developed under the Saxons, centred on a village clustered around the intersection of the Windsor-Kingston road running east–west along the river with the road north to Twickenham, around the hillock on which St Mary&#x27;s Church stands. The Anglo-Saxon parish of Hampton included the area comprising present-day Hampton, Hampton Hill, Hampton Wick, Bushy Park, parts of Teddington, and Hampton Court.

The Hampton settlement developed under the manorial system (where tenant serfs work the arable farm and grazing land of the manor on behalf of the absentee lord) as an agricultural domain primarily supporting neighbouring Kingston, which by the 9th century was a significant royal estate. Bushy Park shows extensive use of the ridge and farrow system of agriculture introduced by the Saxons. The 1086 Domesday Book records that prior to the Norman Conquest the Manor of Hampton belonged to Aelfgar, Earl of Mercia, but indicated that, as Aelfgar had not passed his lands to his son Edwin upon his death in 1062, they were instead held by King Harold at the time of the Norman Invasion.The name Hampton may come from the Anglo-Saxon words &quot;hamm&quot; meaning an enclosure in the bend of a river and &quot;ton&quot; meaning farmstead or settlement. Hamntone is recorded in the Domesday Book, the entry listing 41 villagers and 4 smallholders (accounting for households comprising ~200 individuals) occupying 35 hides, each comprising the area that could be ploughed by eight oxen in a year (~120 acres, or ~4,200 acres total). The demesne (lands belonging to the lord of the manor) comprised 18 hides tilled by only 3 ploughs, indicating it was used mostly for sheep pasture. The other 17 villanes (hides leased to serfs) each had a plough, suggesting cultivation. The entry also recorded a substantial meadow (for the provision of hay for plough animals) and a significant fishery.

The Domesday Book records the total annual value of the estate in 1086 (used to calculate how much tax the lord should be charged) as 39 pounds. The assessed 1086 value was 9 pounds &quot;less&quot; than prior to the conquest, attributed to the devastation caused by Norman forces on their circuitous route around London as they sought its subjugation.

After the Conquest the Manors of Hampton and Isleworth (comprising the hundred of Hounslow) were granted to Walter of Saint-Valéry, from whose home town in Flanders, Saint Valery-sur-Somme, William had sailed in 1066. Walter probably never resided in Middlesex, and he and his heirs were active participants in the First and Second Crusades. In 1189 the estate passed to Thomas de St Valerie, who, as a baron in the &quot;extraordinarily difficult&quot; position of holding large possessions on both sides of the English Channel in the time of Magna Carta and the rebellion against King John, appears to have taken the precaution of severing the two holdings—transferring the Manor of Hampton to Henry de St Albans, a London merchant, and the Manor of Isleworth to his daughter Annora&#x27;s husband, Robert III of Dreux—at some point before the 1217 Battle of Lincoln (in which he was implicated and ultimately exiled). The Manor of Hampton transferred from the hundred of Hounslow to that of Spelthorne in the late 12th or early 13th century.

=== Medieval Hampton and the Knights Hospitaller ===
The Manor was acquired in 1237 by the Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem (known as the &quot;Knights Hospitaller&quot;). A Benedictine order charged with the care and defence of the Holy Land, the Knights Hospitaller operated from headquarters on Rhodes, using their holdings in England (received via bequests from returning Crusaders) to fund their operations. The Order became established in Hampton around 1180 (probably by a gift from Reginald St Valery), and by 1237 owned a house and sheep pasture on the site of present-day Hampton Court Palace. In 1338, the Order commissioned a financial survey of its possessions in England, which showed the Manor of Hampton comprising 800 acres of demesne (rented arable land), 40 acres of meadow by the Thames, pasture for 24 oxen, 18 cows, 10 store cattle and 2000 sheep, a fish weir and a pigeon house.

The Knights Hospitallers developed their estate at Hampton Court into one of the largest and best-appointed of their manors in England, and it was frequently used by the royal court as alternative accommodation to Sheen Palace (the royal palace on the Thames at Richmond), and as a way station and guest house for visitors en route to the royal manor at Byfleet on the River Wye (constructed by Edward II in the early 14th century).

The destruction by fire of Sheen Palace in 1497 saw the royal court move to Hampton Court. In 1500 the Lord Chamberlain Sir Giles Daubeney ordered that 300 acres of the demesne near Hampton be enclosed for hunting, taking out a lease for the entire manor in 1505. After his death in 1508, the lease passed to Sir Giles&#x27; wife, who allowed it to lapse. Cardinal Wolsey purchased the lease from the Knights Hospitaller in 1514, and continued development of the site into the historic palace ultimately acquired by Henry VIII after Wolsey&#x27;s demise in 1530.

=== Post-medieval Hampton ===
The 1534 Act of Supremacy enshrining Henry VIII as supreme head of the Church of England saw the expropriation of Catholic properties throughout England. The Knights Hospitallers Order was formerly dissolved by an Act of Parliament in 1540 and the manor annexed by the Crown. In 1536 Henry acquired part of Teddington from the Abbot of Westminster, enclosing the land for hunting. In 1537 Henry emparked the arable land around Upper Lodge and ordered the construction of brick walls from Hampton Court to Teddington and Hampton Wick. The boundaries of modern-day Bushy Park were set in 1620 with the addition of the Hampton Eastfield (nearest the town). 
The supply of water for the ever-increasing population of the royal complex at Hampton Court had been problematic since the time Wolsey had first taken the Hospitallers&#x27; lease, but it was not until Charles I ordered the construction of a canal connecting the River Colne to the Thames via Hampton Court that the palace secured a steady supply for its household and expanding water features. Designed by Nicholas Lane, the canal started at Longford on the Colne, and was built swiftly in 1638–39, cutting through Feltham, Hanworth, Hounslow Heath, and the north Hampton heath on its route to Bushy Park. Initially unpopular for blocking roads and dividing parishes, the original river (variously known as the Cardinal&#x27;s, Queen&#x27;s or King&#x27;s River) was poorly made and prone to flooding. Protesters dammed the river in 1649 and the river fell into disuse and ran dry during the Protectorate. After the Restoration, Charles II sought to replicate in Bushy Park the garden at Versailles, establishing the Long Water in Home Park as a wedding present for Catherine of Braganza, and thus ordered the Longford River restored.

Between 1500 and 1700 the population of Hampton and Hampton Wick grew from 300–350 to 1100–1200. This growth came despite regular outbreaks of plague in London, which both culled the citizenry and swelled the population of Hampton with the migration of London citizens out of the city. In 1603, 99 of the 119 deaths recorded among Hampton&#x27;s 400-500 inhabitants were attributed to plague, compared to 11 total deaths the previous year. 

In the Christmas of 1603-04 the newly crowned James I moved his court to Hampton Court Palace to escape the outbreak that had blighted London (and Hampton) that summer, before hosting the conference of bishops and clerics (also postponed due to plague) which would commission the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; and the King James Version of the Bible. In July 1665 the court of Charles II escaped London to Hampton Court after an escalating outbreak of plague in the spring (which would come to be known as &quot;The Great Plague&quot;), but would be forced to move again to Oxford in September after the infection reached Hampton.

=== Hampton in the Modern era ===

Hampton&#x27;s transition from medieval manor to privately owned land and housing began with the passage of the (51 Geo. 3. c. cxxxviii), which led to the parcelling and enclosure of common land, and a steady increase in population. The rapid growth and urbanisation of 19th-century London saw agricultural production pushed out to the city&#x27;s perimeter. Land in north Hampton which had been used for grazing and farming was enclosed and, after unsuccessful attempts at residential development, was converted to market gardens and nurseries to service the increased demand from London markets.

Having last been used as a royal residence by George II, Queen Victoria opened the State Apartments of Hampton Court Palace to the general public in 1838, displaying artworks from the Royal Collection. The 1840-46 restoration and redecoration of the Great Hall saw the palace became a major tourist attraction. Visitor numbers increased further following the opening of the Hampton Court branch line (off the London and Southampton Railway mainline) in 1849 (see Hampton Court Palace).

The passage of the Metropolis Water Act 1852 made it unlawful for any water company to extract water for domestic use from the tidal reaches of the Thames (i.e. below Teddington Lock). This led to the Southwark and Vauxhall, Grand Junction and West Middlesex water companies to jointly construct water works on the Thames at Hampton, between the Sunbury and Molesey Locks, which began operations in 1855, and became a major employer (see Hampton Water Treatment Works).

The Shepperton branch line, including Hampton and Fulwell stations, was opened in 1864, and electrified in 1916. The curve of the railway line would come to define the suburb of Hampton distinct from the original village, but did not immediately lead to an increase in population (unlike neighbouring Teddington). The &#x27;New Street&#x27; (now Station Road) was developed along the route of a historic trackway to link Hampton Station to the village. The area around the station between the railway line and the water works began to be developed for housing in the 1880s and 1890s, and was occupied primarily by Metropolitan Water Board staff and their families. Hampton recorded a population of 1,722 in the Census of 1801, rising to 3,134 in the Census of 1851, and 9,220 in the Census of 1911. The passage of the Local Government Act 1858 allowed for the creation of elected Local Boards, which, unlike civil parishes, had the power to borrow money against future revenue, allowing for capital projects. Hampton residents initially voted in 1865 against establishing a Local Board, but after being subsumed into the Kingston Rural Sanitary Authority in 1872, voted in favour of establishment in 1884. Permission was however denied on the basis of Hampton being too small an area, and a Local Board was not created for Hampton until 1890. The Board converted to an Urban District Council in 1895, and established its office in Rosehill in 1902 (see Rosehill and Hampton Library).

St Mary&#x27;s Church had been demolished in 1829 and replaced by the present larger building in 1831, at which time the parish of Hampton Wick was separately established. The parish of Hampton was further divided with the establishment of the parish of St James&#x27;s Hampton Hill in 1863, and the parish of All Saints&#x27; in 1929 following the consecration of All Saints Church in 1908.

Hampton developed into its current form of a residential suburb of London over the course of the late 19th and 20th centuries, as the families of professional workers settled within commuting distance of the city, and demand for local shops and services grew. A police station was first opened in Hampton in c1840, and moved into purpose-built premises at 12 Station Road in 1846 (with an inspector and 9 constables). A &quot;new and more commodious&quot; Police Station was opened at 68 Station Road in 1905. Hampton fire station was built in 1897. London United Tramways extended its network from Twickenham to Hampton, Hampton Court, East Twickenham (west of Richmond Bridge) and Teddington in 1903.

=== Hampton during the Great War and Interwar period ===
Following the outbreak of the Great War recruitment drives were held by both services on Hampton Court Green in the summer of 1915. A mass meeting on Hampton Court Road in June 1916 calling for government action regarding aliens was followed later that month by a meeting of 5,000 people on Hampton Court Green calling for the internment of all Germans and Austrians. St Mary&#x27;s Hospital was used throughout the war as a military hospital, and the Whitehall Hotel was converted to a military hospital in January 1917. Food shortages led to the ploughing and cultivation of fields in Bushy Park, and allotments established in Nine-Acre Field in Percy Road and other open land throughout Hampton. 

Suburban development of the area bound north of the railway line took place mostly during the Interwar period: the streetplan laid out generally following old lanes and field boundaries. The commercial centre of Hampton also gravitated away from the original triangle of streets around St Mary&#x27;s Church to along Station Road near Hampton Station, as the increased popularity of the motor car led to increased traffic (and associated dust, mud, noise) along the road between Sunbury and Kingston. The Electric Theatre opened in 1912 on Station Road, seating 400. Renamed &quot;The Palaceum&quot; in the 1920s, it operated until 1938. Hampton Pool was built in 1922 (on land previously occupied by the Hampton and Hampton Hill Rifle Club) after plans approved in 1914 were delayed due to the outbreak of the World War I (see Hampton Pool). 

The four storey telephone exchange on High Street near St Mary&#x27;s was built in 1927 as a replacement for the original telephone exchange at Manor Road in Molesey (hence known as the Molesey Telephone Exchange). The exchange switched from manual operation to Subscriber Trunk Dialling in the 1960s, and an additional building constructed on the other side of Old Farm Passage ini 1982. The exchange was enabled for ADSL broadband internet in 2000, and the newer building demolished in 2001.

=== Hampton during the Second World War ===

Preparations by the Borough of Twickenham for the outbreak of hostilities in the Second World War began in 1936, and a public meeting held to discuss the enlistment of Air Raid Precaution (ARP) wardens held in the Public Hall on Church Street on 30 November that year. Anderson shelters were distributed to houses in Hampton, and public shelters constructed, during 1939-1940. Three air-raid rescue parties (out of 11 for the Borough) were established in Oldfield Road. 

The first bomb to fall on the Borough in the Battle of Britain fell on 153 Tudor Road in the first night attack on London on 24 August 1940, and properties throughout Hampton were damaged and destroyed as bombing continued through 1940. On 7 October a high-explosive bomb landing in Warfield Road demolished most of the houses on Station Road between the &quot;Worlds End&quot; and &quot;Railway Inn&quot; pubs, killing four. Four nights later a high-explosive bomb damaged another five neighbouring shops on Station Road. On the night of 7 November Hampton was hit by 8 high-explosive bombs, killing six people. 

In 1944 V1 flying bombs and later V2 rockets either passed over or landed in or near Hampton (their distinctive noises recorded in residents&#x27; diaries). On 19 June 1944 two V1 bombs landed in Hampton, one near Hampton Grammar School (breaking two panes of glass), the other falling into a reservoir at the Hampton Water Treatment Works blowing out the windows of the nearby Grange building. On 7 January 1945, a V2 rocket was heard to pass over Hampton and land in Teddington.

VE Day celebrations were held in Carlisle Park, with dancing from 8 to 11 pm; a drumhead service was held on Sunday 9 June, and children&#x27;s events on 10 June, culminating with fireworks.

=== Post-war Hampton ===

==== Regeneration ====
Post-war austerity and recovery meant construction activity in Hampton focussed on the immediate needs of house rebuilding and repair, with construction of new roads and housing not returning to pre-war levels until the mid-1950s. The 1970s and 1980s saw the demolition and regeneration of significant parts of Hampton, including land occupied by the nurseries, and derelict properties along the riverfront.

The Hampton nurseries had begun to face competition in the 1960s from overseas and domestic produce sourced using refrigeration, air freight and cheaper labour, and by the 1970s had become uncompetitive and increasingly derelict. After a lengthy planning process, work to develop the area into the Nurserylands Housing estate began in 1980, with 48 new roads built by 1989. The Sainsbury&#x27;s &#x27;superstore&#x27; built on the site of the St Clare&#x27;s nursery in 1989-90 was at the time the largest built by Sainsbury&#x27;s in the UK. The population of Hampton North / Hampton Nursery rose from 3,977 to 6,426 between the 1981 and 1991 Censuses.

During the 1970s several historic Thames Street properties backing onto the river became derelict, partly due to the planning blight associated with proposals to construct an elevated road along the riverside, and were successively demolished during the 1980s. &quot;Spring Grove&quot;, constructed in the 1760s by the Clerk of Works at Hampton Court Palace on the site of the original conduit house supplying the palace, was demolished in 1981, having fallen into disrepair and despite repeated proposals for restoration. &quot;St Albans&quot;, an imposing Restoration-era riverside property on Hampton Court Road, had been bequeathed to the Borough of Twickenham upon the death of the owner in 1961, but inaction on the part of the Council saw the property fall into disrepair and become unstable, and the property was demolished in February 1972. The gardens of St Albans are retained as St Albans Riverside.

The population of Hampton in the 2021 Census was recorded as 27,307, with 77.4% recording the United Kingdom as their country of birth. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 52% of Hampton residents in employment recorded in the 2021 Census that they worked mainly from home, compared to 32% for England, reflecting Hampton&#x27;s status as a commuter suburb.

== Hampton and the River Thames ==
Hampton stands on the north bank of a bend in the River Thames, and has a close historical association with the river as a trading post, commercial/industrial centre, and recreation destination.

=== Industry ===
Boatyards and slipways have led down to the river from the village for centuries. Benn&#x27;s boathouse on Thames Street was reputed to have been built before 1704 (being demolished in 1946-7 and merging with Constable&#x27;s boatyard next door).

Platt&#x27;s Eyot was the site of multiple boatyards during the 19th and 20th centuries. Thomas Tagg constructed the first boatyard on the island&#x27;s eastern end in 1866, with German electric engine builder Moritz Immisch taking over the site to build electric launches from 1888. In 1904 shipbuilder John Isaac Thornycroft established the Hampton Launch Works, generating cabin cruisers and pleasure craft, including world water speed record holder Miss England III. During wartime, production shifted: to torpedo-carrying motor launches in the First World War, and constructing motor torpedo boats, motor launches and landing craft during the Second World War.

=== Recreation ===

In the 19th century the growth of the London middle class, increase in leisure time (assisted by the passage of the Bank Holidays Act 1871), and the extension of rail and tram networks to London&#x27;s perimeter, saw attractions on the Thames become destinations for mass recreation. Rowing became a popular activity from the mid-19th century and Hampton Reach came to host regular regattas (see Rowing). Significant numbers of day-trippers would travel by river, tram and rail to visit Hampton Court Palace after it was opened to the public (with free admission) in 1838 (see Hampton Court Palace). Tagg&#x27;s Island became the site of multiple resort hotel developments, culminating with the grand &quot;Karsino Hotel&quot; in 1913. As Henry Ripley wrote in 1883:
=== Islands ===
Hampton comprises Platt&#x27;s Eyot, Benn&#x27;s Island and Tagg&#x27;s Island, but historically also includes Garrick&#x27;s Ait and Ash Island.

==== Platt&#x27;s Eyot ====

Platt&#x27;s Eyot is a large island opposite the Hampton Water Treatment Works. Historically willow was cultivated on the island for osiers, with the island becoming the site of multiple boatyards and light industry in the late 19th and 20th centuries (see Industry). In 1910, the height of the island&#x27;s western end was augmented by fill from the excavation of the Stain Hill Reservoirs. The island was connected to the north bank of the Thames by a pedestrian bridge in 1941. Boat building ceased in the 1960s and the boatsheds reverted to light industrial use, including being used as music studios. The boatyards were largely destroyed by fire in 2021.

==== Benn&#x27;s Island ====

Benn&#x27;s Island is a small uninhabited island close to the Hampton riverbank below St Mary&#x27;s Church. In the 19th century the island was occupied by the Thames Valley Sailing Club (since relocated to Sunbury Lock Ait), and since 1945 has been leased by the Hampton Sailing Club.

==== Tagg&#x27;s Island ====

Tagg&#x27;s Island is an inhabited private island surrounded by 62 houseboats in a self-styled community of artists and creatives. Historically, the island has been the site of multiple hotel and resort developments, including the Island Hotel established by Thomas Tagg (after whom the island is named), the famous &quot;Karsino&quot; built by impresario Fred Karno, which, following Karno&#x27;s bankruptcy, became known as the Thames Riveria under various owners. The island was bought by car manufacturer AC Cars in 1940, who converted the skating rink and tennis courts into factory space for wartime munitions, and later, Invacars for the Ministry of Pensions. The hotel was demolished in 1971. In 1980 houseboat owners Gerry and Gillian Braban bought the island, excavating a lagoon in the centre of the island (increasing the number of houseboats by 20) and rebuilding a road bridge to the north bank.

=== River crossings ===

Hampton Ferry has linked Hampton to the south bank of the Thames at Hurst Park, Molesey since at least 1514, and reputedly since the time of the Domesday book. 

A ferry had also operated linking Hampton Court to present-day East Molesey since the Tudor period, with a bridge first constructed on the site in 1753. The present-day Hampton Court Bridge, opened in 1933, is the fourth iteration.

=== Locks and river management ===
Hampton lies on the River Thames upstream of Molesey Lock and downstream of Sunbury Lock.

The River Thames has always been a key waterway for the supply of goods along its banks and in and out of London. In the 19th century, barges carrying up to 200 tons of material, hauled by men or horses along tow paths, were a common sight along the Hampton/Molesey Reach and an integral part of the river economy. But as river traffic increased, the &quot;ad hoc&quot; wooden weirs and dams constructed to maintain the river level became unsatisfactory. A lock was first proposed to manage the shallows at &quot;Kenton Hedge and Sundbury Flatts above&quot; in 1802, but it was not until 1812 that Parliament passed an Act for the construction of a lock, and Molesey Lock was completed in 1815. There had been a weir at Sunbury to divert water for better navigation since 1789, and the first lock was opened in 1812. The lock was rebuilt downstream in 1856 after the Hampton Water Treatment Works were built. A second lock was opened in 1927.

== Local Features ==

=== Hampton Water Treatment Works ===

The Hampton Water Treatment Works, currently owned and operated by Thames Water, occupy a 66 hectare site located between the A308 Upper Sunbury Road and the Thames. The Waterworks were constructed in the late 1850s and 1860s as a joint venture of three London water companies, after the passage of the 1852 Metropolis Water Act which made it unlawful to take drinking water from the tidal Thames below Teddington Lock because of the amount of sewage in the tidal river. The original works were designed by Joseph Quick and J.W. Restler, and the site comprises filter beds and four massive engine pump houses constructed in Gault brick, with large arched windows and decorative balustrades. The Waterworks was in the past a significant local employer, and its brick pumphouses dominate the local landscape. The Waterworks currently has a maximum output of 700 megalitres a day, and supplies about 30% of London&#x27;s fresh water.

=== Garrick&#x27;s Villa and Temple to Shakespeare ===
==== Garrick&#x27;s Villa ====

David Garrick, a renowned 18th century actor and playwright, purchased Hampton House, an established country house facing the Thames on the road to Hampton Court, in 1754. Numerous alterations were made to the house during Garrick&#x27;s residence by the neoclassical architect Robert Adam, including an imposing portico, the building of an orangery and the construction of a tunnel under the road to connect with his riverside lawn. The house became known as Garrick&#x27;s Villa, and received Grade I listing in 1952.

==== Garrick&#x27;s Temple to Shakespeare ====
In 1755 Garrick commissioned an (unknown) architect to construct a garden folly as a temple to his muse, William Shakespeare. The architect designed an octagonal domed building modelled on the Pantheon in the Classical style with an Ionic portico, to be constructed in the villa&#x27;s riverside garden. The temple&#x27;s interior was furnished as a shrine to Shakespeare, exhibiting Garrick&#x27;s collection of Shakespearean relics, and used by Garrick quite place to study, learn lines and entertain guests. Garrick&#x27;s collection was sold on the death of his widow, but the temple was preserved and restored, becoming known as Garrick&#x27;s Temple to Shakespeare, and also receiving Grade I listing in 1952. Garrick&#x27;s Temple is now a museum, concert venue and educational facility, open to the public on Sunday afternoons in the summer.

=== Hampton Court Palace ===
Cardinal Wolsey began construction in 1514 of a royal palace on the site of Hampton Court formerly occupied by the Knights Hospitaller, which was continued and expanded by Henry VIII after Wolsey&#x27;s demise in 1530. Hampton Court Palace went on to become a centre of royal power in the Tudor period. The palace underwent extensive renovation in the Baroque style during the reign of William III, designed by Christopher Wren. Queen Victoria opened the palace to the public in 1838 and the site became and remains a major tourist attraction. The palace is managed today by Historic Royal Palaces, an independent charity.

=== Roy Grove cannon and the Anglo-French geodetic survey ===

A cannon in Roy Grove marks the Hampton end of the baseline measured in 1784 by General William Roy in preparation of the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790) to measure the relative situation of Greenwich Observatory and Paris Observatory. This high precision survey was the forerunner of the Principal Triangulation of Great Britain which commenced in 1791, one year after Roy&#x27;s death. In the report of the operation Roy gives the locations of the ends of the baseline as Hampton Poor-house and King&#x27;s Arbour. The latter lies with the confines of Heathrow Airport. The exact end points of the baseline were originally made by two vertical pipes which carried flag-poles but in 1791, when the base was remeasured, the ends were marked by two cannons sunk into the ground.

=== Other notable features ===

==== Rosehill and Hampton Library ====
Rosehill is a prominent 18th century Grade II Listed stock-brick built house on the Upper Sunbury Road. Built for the celebrated 18th century tenor John Beard, it was purchased by the Urban District Council (UDC) in 1902 and used as Council Offices and Library until 1937 when Hampton Council was joined with Twickenham and Teddington, and the whole house was given over for use as the Hampton Library. The building sports blue plaques for former residents, the singer John Beard and William Ewart MP, the Politician behind the Public Libraries Act 1850.

==== Pubs and inns ====
The oldest buildings and most longstanding businesses in Hampton are current and former pubs and inns. These include:

* &quot;The Feathers&quot;. Constructed c. 1540 on the corner of Thames Street and Church Street, &quot;The Feathers&quot; operated as a pub from c. 1630 until 1792, and was frequented by Samuel Johnson and David Garrick. The building was later converted into cottages, one of which was let to historian Henry Ripley in 1874 (see Hampton and the River Thames), and which remains the oldest surviving building in Hampton. 
* &quot;The Shipp / The Red Lion&quot;. Constructed c. 1660 at No. 1 High Street, and renamed in the 1750s, &quot;The Red Lion&quot; was a focal point for members of London society in the late 19th century, particularly for crowds travelling by ferry to watch horse racing or boxing on Molesey Hurst. Having been gutted by fire the pub was rebuilt in 1909, and closed in 1980.
* &quot;The Bell Inn&quot;. Located on Thames Street with a prominent view of the River, a pub has operated on the site of &quot;The Bell&quot; since at least 1557. In 1892 the pub was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in its current mock-Tudor form. &quot;The Bell&quot; is mentioned in works by Dickens and T.S. Eliot (see Literature).
* &quot;Jolly Coopers&quot;. Originally called &quot;The Glass Bottle&quot;, Jolly Coopers has traded at No. 16 High Street since c. 1720, and is Hampton&#x27;s oldest pub still operating in its original premises. 
* &quot;The Court Jester / The Hampton / The Hamptons Ale House.&quot; &quot;The Court Jester&quot; opened in November 1980 in the heart of the redeveloped Nurserylands estate (see Modern Hampton). After a fire in 2017 the pub now trades as &quot;The Hamptons Ale House&quot;.

==== Hampton Youth Project ====
Hampton Youth Project is a youth centre established in Tangley Park in 1990. Built in a converted coach depot on the Nurserylands Estate it offers a wide programme of activities for those aged 11–19.

==== Beveree wildlife site ====
The Beveree Wildlife Site to the north of Station Road is a Site of Local Importance for Nature Conservation. It is a small secluded area of green open space, mixed woodland, self-seeded fruit trees, scrub, two small meadows, and orchard trees.

==== Tagg&#x27;s Island sundial ====

In the park of St Albans Riverside beside the bridge leading to Tagg&#x27;s Island is a sundial, &quot;a globe with numbered longitude fins and tropic latitudes, resting on three balls, all upon a bell-shaped base&quot; designed by David Harber.

==== Hampton Cemetery ====

Hampton Cemetery is a cemetery on Hollybush Lane in Hampton. The cemetery was opened in 1879, and fourteen Commonwealth servicemembers of World War I and seven of World War II are buried in the cemetery.

== Sport and leisure ==
=== Football ===

Hampton &amp; Richmond Borough F.C. are a semi-professional club playing at step 2 of Non-League football in the National League South. The club has played at Beveree Stadium (capacity: 3,500) since 1959.

=== Rugby ===
Twickenham Rugby Football Club can trace its establishment to 1867, and moved to its current home ground at Parkfields west of Hampton in 1930.

=== Cricket ===

Hampton&#x27;s first cricket club, the Royal Clarence Cricket Club, was founded in 1828. Sponsored by its patron the Duke of Clarence, the club played its matches on what is now Hurst Park in Molesey.

Hampton Hill Cricket Club was established in 1855 (as New Hampton Cricket Club) and moved to its present ground in Bushy Park in 1890. The club also plays at Carlisle Park in Hampton.

=== Sailing ===

The River Thames widens at Hampton Reach, and the prevailing south-westerly breeze over Hurst Park makes the river an attractive venue for sailing. Benn&#x27;s Island was occupied by the Thames Valley Sailing Club in the 19th century, and since 1945 has been leased by the Hampton Sailing Club, which operates a clubhouse and boatyard. The club&#x27;s racing course runs from upstream of Platt&#x27;s Eyot down to Tagg&#x27;s Island.

=== Rowing ===
A Watermen&#x27;s Regatta was first run at Hampton in 1835, and which ran until 1910, becoming an informal entertainment (including water jousting and canoe polo) in its final years.

Molesey Boat Club has operated the Molesey Regatta since 1867. For much of its early history, the race course finished downriver from Garrick&#x27;s Temple, with crowds and officials massing on Garrick&#x27;s Lawn. The current race course follows an 850-metre course starting upstream of Platt&#x27;s Eyot and finishing opposite the Waterworks and Hurst Park.

The rowing clubs of Hampton School and Lady Eleanor Holles School jointly operate the Millennium Boathouse, opposite the upstream end of Platt&#x27;s Eyot on the north bank of the Thames. Both clubs have produced multiple British school champions, competitors in the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race, and international representatives.

=== Canoeing ===
Originally founded as the Westel Club in 1970, Hampton Canoe Club has operated from the old pumping station at Bell Hill since 1990.

=== Triathlon ===
Thames Turbo Triathlon Club was established in 2012, and is based at Hampton Pool. The Club runs an annual triathlon on the first Bank Holiday Monday in May, with the swim leg at Hampton Pool, the cycle course along Hampton Court Road/Lower Sunbury Road/B375 from Hampton Court to Dumsey Meadow, and the run leg in Bushy Park. The Club also runs an annual junior aquathlon at Lady Eleanor Holles School in June.

=== Hampton Pool ===

Hampton Heated Open Air Pool and Gym near Bushy Park was built in 1922 after plans approved in 1914 were delayed due to the outbreak of the First World War. A diving pit and filtration system was added in 1939, and the pool widened in 1961. The pool was closed by the council in 1980 due to financial reasons, and re-opened with community support in 1985, with management transferred to a dedicated charity.

==Hampton in art, literature and other media==

=== Art ===

==== Alfred Sisley and Camille Pissarro ====

Following the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war some Impressionist artists sought refuge in England. Anglo-French Impressionist painter Alfred Sisley came to England in 1874 at the invitation of baritone Jean-Baptist Faure, settling in Hampton Court in the summer and painting a series of paintings along the banks of the River Thames around Hampton Court and Molesey. &quot;Regatta at Molesey near Hampton Court&quot; features the Molesey Regatta, with the recently constructed Island Hotel visible on Tagg&#x27;s Island in the background. &quot;The Thames with Hampton Church&quot; shows the view up river from Molesey towards Hampton, featuring St Mary&#x27;s Church and Garrick&#x27;s Temple to Shakespeare. French Impressionist painter Camille Pissarro first visited London in 1870, and made further visits throughout his lifetime. During a short visit to visit his son George in May–June 1890 Pissarro painted six canvases of various London outdoor scenes (including &quot;Charing Cross Bridge&quot;&quot;,&quot; &quot;Old Chelsea Bridge&quot; and &quot;Primrose Hill, London&quot;). Among these works was &quot;Hampton Court Green&quot;, depicting a cricket match on the green.

Eliot sought respite from the intrigues of London&#x27;s literary circles (and his wife Vivien) by holing up at the Bell Inn in Hampton, writing to his editor John Hayward under the nom-de-plume &#x27;White Cargo&#x27;. Eliot&#x27;s residence at the Bell Inn led to a reference in &quot;Old Possum&#x27;s Book of Practical Cats&quot;. 
==== Jerome K. Jerome ====
Hampton is also mentioned in humorist Jerome K. Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;.

<text>Hanwell () is a town in the London Borough of Ealing. It is about west of Ealing Broadway and had a population of 28,768 as of 2011. It is the westernmost location of the London post town.

Hanwell is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. St Mary&#x27;s Church was established in the tenth century and has been rebuilt three times since, the present church dating to 1842. Schools were established around this time in Hanwell; notably Central London District School which Charlie Chaplin attended. By the end of the 19th century there were over one thousand houses in Hanwell. The Great Western Railway came in 1838 and Hanwell railway station opened. Later the trams of London United Tramways came on the Uxbridge Road in 1904, running from Chiswick to Southall. From 1894 it was its own urban district of Middlesex until being absorbed into Ealing Urban District in 1926.

To its west flows the River Brent, which marks Hanwell&#x27;s boundary with Southall. There are several green spaces including Brent Valley Park, Elthorne Park and Cuckoo Park; meanwhile, the Hanwell Zoo is a popular local attraction featuring small mammals, birds and other wildlife. Its elevation is approximately . The town holds its own annual Hanwell Carnival, London&#x27;s oldest carnival.

==History==

=== Etymology ===
The name probably means &#x27;spring/stream frequented by cocks&#x27;.

The earliest surviving reference is AD 959 when it is recorded as &quot;Hanewelle&quot; in pledge, when Alfwyn (a Saxon) pawned his land for money to go on a pilgrimage. The origin of the name is uncertain; various suggestions have been put forward.

Near to the old Rectory and close to Hanwell spring is a large stone of about a ton in weight. In Anglo-Saxon the word &quot;Han&quot; denoted a boundary stone. This juxtaposition of these two natural features could have given rise to the name &quot;Han-well&quot;, which dates back to before the Domesday Book.

The original borders of the parish stretched from the bend of the River Brent at Greenford and followed the river down to the River Thames. Its geography, before the draining of the marshes, formed a natural boundary between the different tribes of the south east of England. This gives some support to the suggestion that &quot;Han&quot; came from the Saxon &quot;han&quot; for cockerel. If so, the name is derived from &quot;Han-créd-welle&quot;. &quot;Han-créd&quot; or cock-crow meant the border between night and day, and is neither one nor the other. So Hanwell would mean &quot;well upon the boundary&quot;. &quot;For more see: River Brent: Hydronymy&quot;.

The only other Hanwell in Britain is a small parish in Oxfordshire on the boundary with Warwickshire.

===Short history of the inns and public houses===
The Uxbridge Road (then known as the Oxford Road) was turnpiked between Uxbridge and Tyburn in 1714. The revenue from tolls enabled an all-weather metaled road surface of compacted gravel to be laid down.

This constant movement of people along the road, brought about the establishment of coaching inns along the road as it crossed the River Brent and passed through the parish of Hanwell. In these inns, travellers could stable their horses, place their carts or goods in safe storage and secure board and lodgings for themselves overnight.

The first inn on crossing the River Brent is &quot;The Viaduct&quot;, which is on the north side. Named after the Wharncliffe Viaduct, its original name was the &quot;Coach and Horses&quot;. At the back of the pub, some of the original stable building can be seen, dating to about 1730. Early in the 20th century, The Viaduct received a new faïence façade, which Nikolaus Pevsner succinctly described as &quot;a jolly tiled Edwardian pub&quot;.

Next was the &quot;Duke of Wellington&quot;, which lay approximately 400 m closer to London on the southern side of the road, roughly opposite the old Hanwell Police Station. However, this had been demolished by the 1920s and was not rebuilt.

Further east still and back across on the north side of the Uxbridge Road at the junction of Hanwell Broadway is the &quot;Duke of York&quot;This became an important staging point for stagecoaches on their way between Oxford and London. Established in the 18th century, it has been subsequently rebuilt in the Tudorbethan style.

The next pub occupies the site of what was probably the very first inn to be established on the Oxford Road as it ran through Hanwell; it is known today as the Kings Arms. It lies on the south side of the road. It was original called the &quot;Spencer Arms&quot;after Edward Spencer, who was Lord of the Manor of Boston during the Civil War. In the 18th century, the Manor Courts hearings were transferred here from Greenford, then later transferred to the Viaduct Inn. However, the present building dates back to 1930 when it was rebuilt by brewers Mann, Crossman &amp; Paulin in the Arts &amp; Crafts style. Though unexciting on the outside, its interior is still today, a fine example of this type of architecture, and CAMRA has placed it in its &quot;National Inventory of Pub Interiors of Outstanding Historic Interest&quot;. The lower half of the exterior walls is decorated with green faïence with brick-sized faces. These tiles extend to cover the stallriser of the shop to the immediate right. This is because, originally, this shop was built to serve as the Off-licence premises.
Gradually, retail stores and shops started to fill the gaps between these inns to take advantage of the passing trade brought by this important route into and out of the city. During the Victorian period, the village to the north of the Uxbridge Road began to slowly expand to the south of the road. Toward the southern end of Green Lane (the old toll-free drovers route into the city) is The Fox public house. The Fox has been named &quot;West Middlesex Pub of the Year&quot; in 2005, 2007, 2010 and 2011. Built in 1848 it is a largely unspoiled and original mid-Victorian pub. It has received a &#x27;local listing&#x27; from Ealing Council as a building of local interest. It is constructed out of local golden yellow brick with more expensive red bricks used for detailing on corners and chimneys. Rich brown glazed tiles are used for the ground floor exterior walls with coloured stained glass in the fan lights. The upper story has Mock Tudor detailing, including dentils on the two outward-facing gables. Most of the interior is also original, although the dividing walls between bars and off-license sales have been taken out to create one large bar area. The present day eating area retains its original wooden wall panelling. On the east of the building itself is a very sheltered beer garden, so food and drink can be enjoyed inside or out. The Fox was the meeting place for the local fox hunt until the 1920s. The hunt would set off across Hanwell Heath, much of which still existed at that time. Present-day clientele can still see foxes drinking, quite unfazed, from the dog bowls of water, put outside the Fox&#x27;s saloon bar.
===Healthcare===

Lying to the west of the River Brent and so actually in the precinct of Norwood Green, the Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum was commonly referred to as the Hanwell Asylum because it was closer to the centre of Hanwell than either Norwood or Southall. The asylum was opened in 1831 to house pauper lunatics. In 1937 it was renamed St Bernard&#x27;s Hospital by which it is still known today. Built on some of its former grounds to the east is Ealing Hospital. Most of the original asylum still remains, with over half having been turned into the St Bernard&#x27;s Gate housing development and the rest remaining as a psychiatric hospital. The most interesting parts are the chapel and an entrance arch, visible from the Uxbridge Road. Within the grounds of Hanwell Asylum, on the west side of the main block, was a small isolation hospital.

The hospital was remarkable as one of its physicians, John Conolly, 1794–1866, was progressive in the treatment of patients and avoided the use of restraints. A memorial garden dedicated to him is at the junction of Station Road with Connolly Road. The hospital did have a museum housed in its chapel, but this collection has now been broken up and relocated. It included many items ranging from patient registers, reports and a large assortment of medical equipment, including a padded cell, consisting of a wooden framework with padded door, walls and floor, but no ceiling.

Within the boundary of Hanwell proper, there were three more asylums. These were all private. The first one recorded, was &quot;Popes House&quot;, which admitted its first patient (it is thought) in 1804.

Later, &quot;Elm Grove House&quot; in Church Road was turned into an asylum by Susan Wood. Her husband was the brother of Mrs Ellis, the wife of William Ellis, the first superintendent of Hanwell Asylum. (This is not to be confused with the similarly named Elm Grove in Ealing which the East India Company took over in 1870 and created the &quot;Royal India Asylum&quot;, which closed in 1892.)

Another local asylum was &quot;Lawn House&quot;, the home and privately run asylum of Dr John Conolly, which he opened after retiring as superintendent of Hanwell Asylum. After his death in 1866, it was taken over by his son-in-law Henry Maudsley who ran it until 1874.

Down Green Lane and on the west side was the old &quot;Hanwell Cottage Hospital&quot;, which was named &quot;The Queen Victoria and War Memorial Hospital&quot;. This was built in 1900 and paid for by public subscription and run on voluntary contributions until the creation of the NHS in 1948. In 1979 it was replaced by &quot;Ealing District General Hospital&quot;, on the other side of the River Brent. The southern Portland stone and brick pier of the cottage hospital&#x27;s entrance, bearing the inscription was preserved as a permanent reminder of Hanwell&#x27;s first hospital. The two original Edwardian street lamps outside the entrance were also preserved, but then mysteriously disappeared, causing enquiries to be made.

===Transport===

In 1901 the first electric trams began to run along the Uxbridge Road, causing the population of the village to expand faster than with the arrival of the trains half a century before. First however, the tram company had to strengthen Hanwell Bridge, as well as widen it on its north side. A balustrade, which survives to this day, lines each side. Another stipulation placed upon the company was that the standards to support the catenary also had to be able to double as street lampposts. The cars cost £1,000 each yet the ordinary fare from Shepherd&#x27;s Bush to Uxbridge was only 8d. 
A route from Brentford to Hanwell was introduced on 26 May 1906.

A tram depot (later converted into a trolleybus depot and then into a bus garage) was located on the Uxbridge Road. It was closed down in 1993 and the land has been converted into a retail park.

AEC Routemaster buses were built at the AEC factory in Windmill Lane and much of the fuel injection equipment and electrical systems were manufactured by CAV Ltd who had a factory in Acton Vale. The large Routemaster tyres were moulded and cured, just to the south on the Great West Road in Brentford by the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company whose factory was opened there in 1928.

Trolley buses were introduced in 1936 and ran until the early 1960s.

Plans to reintroduce trams in the form of the West London Tram scheme were suggested, but then abandoned by Transport for London in 2007 in the face of local opposition.

==Hanwell Estate==

The Hanwell estate is a London County Council cottage estate built between the wars. It provides 1586 houses and flats.

===The parish church===

St Mary&#x27;s Church is the original &quot;ancient parish&quot; church. The present church structure was built in 1841. As such, it stands as one of George Gilbert Scott&#x27;s very early churches, executed in the style of Gothic Revival, and consists of masoned white limestone and gault brickwork, with flint-rubble and mortar panels. Scott himself later condemned his work of this period as &quot;a mass of horrors&quot;. However, the famous painter William Frederick Yeames, who at one time was its churchwarden, is thought to have done the wall paintings in the chancel.

Perhaps the most famous rector was Dr. George H. Glasse; he has a memorial place in his memory in St. Mary&#x27;s Churchyard (Grade II). Still surviving is the home he had built for him nearby in 1809. It is executed in the style of cottage orné and named The Hermitage (Grade II). Nikolaus Pevsner described it thus: &quot;a peach of an early c19 Gothic thatched cottage with two pointed windows, a quatrefoil, and an ogee arched door, all on a minute scale. Inside, an octagonal hall and reception room&quot;.

In latter years another well-known rector was Fred Secombe (brother of Harry Secombe). After leaving and moving back to Wales, he became a prolific author.
No archaeological evidence has been found so far, to show that any church existed here earlier than shown in written records. However, due to its commanding topographical position, which enables the distinctive broach spire to be seen from many miles away, it has been suggested that this may have been a pagan place of worship long before Christianity reached this part of the world. There is however, no evidence to support this theory. An early supporter of this hypothesis was Sir Montagu Sharpe KC DL, a local historian and a member of the Society of Antiquaries. (In nearby Northolt, the parish church, which is also on high ground, has had much evidence found around it of past occupation by the Beaker People.)

===St Thomas the Apostle===

St Thomas&#x27;s is a Grade II* listed building. Edward Maufe won the competition for Guildford Cathedral in 1932. His reputation as a church architect had hitherto rested on restoration work at AIl Saints, Southampton and St Martin&#x27;s in the Fields; and on two churches for the Royal Association for the Deaf at East Acton and Clapham, and – most notable – a well respected &#x27;Clubland&#x27; Methodist chapel in Walworth, which was bombed in the war.

Work on Guildford Cathedral did not begin until 1936. In the meantime Maufe designed St Thomas&#x27;s, for which the foundation stone was laid in July 1933. Completed in 1934, the materials used were an experiment with the form of construction proposed for Guildford. They were the load-bearing silver grey Tondu brick from South Wales and particularly the reinforced concrete vault Iined with acoustic plaster. Many of the interior details are also similar to Guildford Cathedral: most notably the tall lancets and narrow aisle passages with the acutely pointed arches, but also the style of some of the fittings and the employment of Eric Gill as one of the sculptors.

====Exterior====

The large Calvary that arrests attention from the road is by Eric Gill, its cross forming the tracery of the East Window. This was carved &quot;in situ&quot; from a single Weldon stone block. The carving over the north door is the work of Vernon Hill, depicting a dove with the girdle of Our Lady that was sent to St Thomas. To the left of the door, almost at ground level, the seal of Edward Maufe can be seen.

The wave pattern to the brass kicking plates on the doors represents the sea. Inside the north porch is a carving of St Matthew by John Skelton (nephew of Eric Gill).

The carving over the west door is also by Vernon Hill and represents two birds pecking from the same bunch of grapes symbolic of all Christians sharing the one cup at Communion.

====Edward Maufe&#x27;s &#x27;finest church&#x27;====

In her listing report to English Heritage Elain Harwood described St Thomas&#x27; as Maufe&#x27;s &#x27;finest church&#x27;. She writes:

&#x27;Inside the feeling is of a great church exquisitely miniaturised. Indeed, it has frequently been said that Maufe&#x27;s distinctive and austere style was better suited to the small scale than to a cathedral. Moreover, St Thomas&#x27;s substantiates Pevsner&#x27;s admission that Maufe was &quot;a man with genuine spatial gifts&quot;. The initial impression is of a nave and chancel of equal height given semblance of religious presence by narrow passage aisles cut into the thick piers of the vault, Alibi style. The east end is more complicated, however, One becomes aware of a cross axis along the front of the chancel, and another in front of the sanctuary itself On the south side there are vestries and a kitchen: on the north side another door, a Morning Chapel, now called the Lady Chapel, and between them a little Children&#x27;s Corner or chapel set within the thick walls of the tower. There is a small space behind the sanctuary, reached through the arches.&#x27;

====Font and nave====

At the west end of the church is the font, which was also carved by Vernon Hill in Weldon stone. It depicts a fish and anchor and the ICQUS cypher, which are all signs for Christ. The stained glass behind the font, depicting &#x27;Christ and the children&#x27;, is by Moira Forsyth. The War Memorial came from the &#x27;tin church&#x27;, which used to stand where the Parish Hall now stands.

In the Nave, the light fittings are plated with silver and bear the arms of the twelve apostles. The original foot-long candle bulbs are now unobtainable and have been replaced with a modern energy saving equivalent.

The flooring is linoleum and was originally buff in colour and marked out with blue lines. The sign of St. Thomas the Apostle – a builder&#x27;s square and three spears – can be seen on the churchwardens&#x27; staves and various other places in the church. The square indicates that Thomas was a builder and that spears were the instruments of his martyrdom.

====Sanctuary====

The Sanctuary is dominated by the reredos that came from St Thomas&#x27;s Portman Square. It was made to the design of Cecil Greenwood Hare, Bodley&#x27;s last partner and successor to his practice. The three manual organ also came from St Thomas&#x27;, Portman Square and was reconditioned and electrified by Walker and Sons Ltd. 

===St Mellitus Church===

Until the early years of the 20th century all of Hanwell had been one parish, St Mary&#x27;s. The inadequacy of one church to serve a growing population is indicated by the rebuilding of St Mary&#x27;s church in 1842 to cater for the increased number of church goers and then by the building in 1877 of St Mark&#x27;s as an additional church serving the south of the parish. By the turn of the century this was no longer sufficient and it was decided to create an additional parish, St Mellitus, the first in the Anglican Communion to bear that name.

The church building is an imposing Gothic style building of the Edwardian period situated on a busy cross roads in the heart of Hanwell. It was designed by the office of Sir Arthur Blomfield in 1909, built by Messrs J Dorey &amp; Co of Brentford and consecrated by the Bishop of London, Rt Rev Arthur Winnington-Ingram in March 1910. It is a landmark building with a distinctive gable end housing three recently restored bells.

The parish was formed in 1908 and lay between the railway and Elthorne Park, thus including St Mark&#x27;s as a chapel of ease. While St Mark&#x27;s would continue in this fashion as a subsidiary church for the parish, it was clear that a new, bigger parish church was needed and so Sir Arthur Blomfield was commissioned to design it. With a capacity of 800 people it was designated St Mellitus, the name probably derived from the legend, propagated by Sir Montagu Sharpe, the Middlesex historian, that Mellitus, Bishop of the East Saxons, was instrumental in the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons of Hanwell. Funds for the new church were raised from the sale of Holy Trinity in Gough Square in the city of London.

In 1980, with the retirement of the then vicar of St Mark&#x27;s, the two parishes were merged, now known as St Mellitus with St Mark&#x27;s.

===The Wharncliffe Viaduct===
Brunel&#x27;s first major structural design and the first contract to be let on his Great Western Railway. The viaduct carries trains across the Brent valley at an elevation of .

Constructed of brick, the bridge has 8 arches, each spanning and rising . The supporting piers are hollow and tapered, rising to projecting stone cornices that held up the arch centring during construction.

Originally, the piers were wide at ground level and at deck level. The deck was designed to accommodate two tracks of Brunel&#x27;s broad gauge railway.

However, an Act of Parliament was passed in 1846 that made Stephenson&#x27;s narrower gauge standard across the country and so the viaduct was widened in 1847 by the addition of an extra row of piers and arches on the north side. The new width is . In 1892 the broad gauge track was converted to standard gauge, and this allowed enough width for four standard gauge tracks. Overhead electrification, at 25,000 volts AC, of the London to Bristol main line is in progress (2017).

The viaduct is still used today for trains running from Paddington to Bristol. Lord Wharncliffe&#x27;s coat of arms can be seen on the central pier on the south side. He was chairman of the Great Western Railway.

===Hanwell Flight of Locks===

The Hanwell flight of six locks raises the Grand Union Canal by just over and has been designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument by English Heritage. At the top of the flight of locks towards Norwood Green is the Three Bridges designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. It is still often referred to on maps by the original canal crossing name of Windmill Bridge and is very close to the spot where the eponymous windmill once stood; attracting the attention of a local Brentford artist, Joseph Mallard William Turner. However, there was also a windmill on the grounds where the Hanwell asylum once stood and the original name was Watermill Lane. So the true origine of the name appears to originate with the watermill that stood near to the club house of the local golf club house. This canal and flight of locks are actually within the boundary of Southall but are named after the local village of Hanwell, which is much closer than either of the villages of Norwood or Southall.

===The Central London District Poor School/Hanwell Community Centre===

The Central London District Poor School, aka the Cuckoo Schools at Hanwell was built between 1856 and 1861 by a group of central London poor law unions to house and educate pauper children away from the workhouse; the original site at Norwood having proved to be too small and unsuitable for extension. By far its most famous resident was Charlie Chaplin who was at the school from June 1896 until January 1898.

The school was closed in 1933 but parts of it remain standing, and it is in use as the Hanwell Community Centre. The Community Centre was used as a location in the film Billy Elliot. It has been declared a Grade II listed building by English Heritage. In 2015 the London Welsh School moved into the building.

===Brent Lodge Park and Animal Centre===

This park was acquired by Ealing Borough Council as a recreation ground in 1931 from Sir Montagu Sharpe (1856–1942), who had lived in Brent Lodge since 1884. The lodge itself, by then dilapidated, was demolished. The original stable block remains and is Grade II listed.
For many years the park served as a 9-hole golf course requiring no more than a small driver and a putt, which could be hired together with a ball from a kiosk. Small boys would supplement their pocket money by retrieving lost balls from the river.

Another attraction was a large wired enclosure, within which unwanted pet rabbits (and tortoises, guinea pigs etc.) were given a new home. This inevitably led to it acquiring the nickname &#x27;Bunny Park&#x27;, which is still how most locals refer to it today. Later, the animal collection became more exotic as it began to receive and house imported animals that remained unclaimed after their period of compulsory quarantine had expired. Better enclosures were built and it has now become a small zoo and is a recognized member of the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA). As of April 2016, the animal centre has been renamed Hanwell Zoo, and is home to such animals as Mara, Capybara, Meerkats, Caribbean Flamingo and Crested Porcupine, Emperor Tamarin monkeys and Ring-tailed Lemurs.

The park has a modern and well-equipped children&#x27;s playground. Clearly visible on Google Earth are the 2,000 yew trees that were planted to create the Millennium Maze. The entrance to the park is at the south-west side of St Mary&#x27;s Church at the end of Church Road.

The park also has a coffee shop and a children&#x27;s play area.

=== Brent River Park and Brent Valley Golf Club ===
The Lodge Park is part of the larger Brent River Park, which follows the river from Perivale down to Hanwell. In this river valley, there is also the Brent Valley Golf Club

===Hanwell Clock Tower===

This was unveiled on Hanwell Broadway at midday on 7 May 1937, as part of Ealing&#x27;s celebration of the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (later known as the Queen Mother) by Alderman Alfred Bradford, chairman of the Highways Committee. The Mayor, Frederick Woodward, was also present, as were members of the Hanwell Chamber of Commerce and &#x27;a large concourse of the general public&#x27;.

Amongst other remarks, the Mayor said: &quot;I consider Hanwell one of the finest gateways to the city of London, and I cannot think of a more fitting place for the clock&quot;. It had been Timothy King, a councillor from Hanwell, who had first suggested the idea and had fought for it in the Highways Committee. Alderman Bradford was proud that the Hanwell Clock had been the result of a Hanwell man&#x27;s work. It was also noted that the Mayor was born in Hanwell (he also attended Hanwell National School and was married there).

However, the clock tower became the centre of controversy in the early 70s. This started because a Hanwell estate agent, one Mr Parish, objected to it and wanted to raise £5,000 to demolish it and replace it with something more pleasing. According to him, the clock tower was a &quot;dreadful concrete eyesore&quot; and &quot;aesthetically pleasing neither in its location nor design&quot;. He added that it was &quot;downright ugly…built in the thirties, one of the worst periods for design&quot;. He also commented &quot;the motive behind it was largely self-congratulatory on the part of a small village community&quot;. The latter statement was certainly open to question, since Mr Parish seemed to have had no evidence to back it up, and nor was Hanwell &quot;a small village community&quot; in 1937 with a population of over 20,000.

This caused much annoyance to both residents of Hanwell and commuters who passed the tower on their way to work. Parish&#x27;s views were seen as &#x27;arrogant&#x27; and &#x27;insulting&#x27;. Some thought it was a useful reminder of the time (Mr Parish later doubted the clock&#x27;s accuracy) or a good meeting place. Others defended it as being in the style of the time &quot;if the clock tower is typical of the thirties, that is how it should be&quot;. The Elthorne Ward Labour Group also defended the tower, some members feeling that its removal might herald the construction of an office block.

On the whole, Parish&#x27;s arguments were countered. The general thrust was that the clock tower needed restoration, not demolition. In the following year, such work was carried out and the tower properly cleaned up. Its appearance even had the effect of converting Mr Parish, who commented &quot;I admit having said some harsh things about its architectural inadequacies&quot;, but he liked the new, clean, clock tower, &quot;Come back, all is forgiven&quot;.

The problem of cleaning and restoration was a common one over future years. Sometimes the edifice had to be boarded up. However, in 2002, as part of the celebrations of the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, the clock tower was again restored. The clock put in operation again and a new plaque displayed to celebrate this renovation.

===Elthorne Park===
The name Elthorne goes back at least one thousand years. It was mentioned in the Domesday survey as being one of the six Hundreds of the shire of Middlesex along with Edmonton, Gore, Hounslow, Ossulstone and Spelthorne.

The origin of the park goes back to the 1500s. The original much larger estate, called La Bromeland, was named after the wild yellow flowering Broom shrub, which still grows on the steep embankment of the river Brent.

In the 16th century Thomas Gresham&#x27;s widow bought the freehold of &#x27;Broomland&#x27;, which later passed down through Osterley to the Earls of Jersey.

Fifteen years after the Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801 the estate was reduced to 90 acres and then became known as Park Farm. At one time, with Cuckoo Farm it was one of the last two existing farms in Hanwell.

In 1908 Lord Jersey started negotiations with the Council and Middlesex County Council about the use of the land. Whilst negotiations were going on he allowed a section of the land to be used as a temporary recreation ground.

The farmland was finally broken up c1910 and some of the land is now open space and playing fields but seven and a half acres of the site were used to form Elthorne Park.

Lord Villiers and his mother, the Countess of Jersey, officially opened the Park at 3 pm on 11 June 1910. The opening, which had been postponed because of the death of King Edward VII on 6 May 1910, was said to be a grand affair, held in a large marquee with tea being served in the nearby mission church of St Thomas&#x27;s.

In July 1910 the first event to be held in the park was a show by the Hanwell and Greenford Horticultural Society, which later became an annual event. The following year in April a two-day celebration of George V&#x27;s coronation took place, which included music from the local Hanwell Band and a march by children from St Ann&#x27;s school to Elthorne Park. 

Although toilets for men were installed in the park from the outset, a toilet for women was not installed until 1912.

The Hanwell ‘Sarsen’ Stone can be seen just inside the main entrance to the park. This stone, a glacial erratic which was deposited in the Ice Age, was excavated from a gravel pit on a site now occupied by Townholm Crescent.

=== Cemeteries ===
There are three burial grounds in Hanwell. The one at the parish church of St Mary is full. The remaining two are for the deceased residents of other boroughs.

For the local people today, the London Borough of Ealing offers interments in Hortus Cemetery, Southall, and Greenford Park Cemetery, Greenford.

====St. Mary&#x27;s church graveyard====
The graveyard of St. Mary&#x27;s is the oldest burial ground. To the east side of the church yard is a large square stone monument to the Glasses family, which English Heritage has given a Grade II listing, although it is in a poor state of repair.

====Westminster City Council Cemetery, Hanwell====
Built on the former common land of South Field, Westminster City Cemetery, Hanwell is an extramural cemetery run by Westminster City Council.

In 1987 Shirley Porter&#x27;s controlled Westminster City Council controversially sold to land developers for 15p. It possesses some fine mausoleums and family vaults.

====Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Cemetery, Hanwell====


Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Cemetery, Hanwell is an extramural Victorian cemetery run by Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. It is situated on the north side of the Uxbridge Road on the former common land of East Field. On the grounds stands a disused chapel. The chapel, gatehouse and entrance arch were designed by Thomas Allom and executed in Kentish ragstone. There are many Victorian and Edwardian graves here.

====Ancient Saxon burials====
Middlesex as a whole has a dearth of early Saxon archaeology. However, the nearby place names of Ealing, Yeading and Harrow are of the early Saxon period, even though there are no surviving records of their presence in the Brent valley and its tributaries at this time.

In 1886, during excavation of gravel on Hanwell Common, seven Saxon graves were discovered. They were found approximately where Oaklands Primary School stands today. Of these burials, it is thought that at least three were men with iron spears. Gold-plated copper alloy brooches were also found and may be seen in the Museum of London. They have been dated to between the fifth and the mid sixth century and attest to the age of this Saxon settlement in Hanwell.

However, when they were first uncovered, it led some historians to suppose that these were warriors slain in battle. Especially since some 50 iron spears were found close by. In Victorian times they only had the written records to go on, and, as no mention of Saxon occupation in Middlesex appear for this period, it was a reasonable hypothesis to consider, even though there was no evidence for this fanciful idea that any had died in battle. Archaeological evidence has since shown that Saxons were already present in small numbers along the River Thames generations earlier. Yet the colourful tale of the Battle of Bloody Croft (given as circa AD 572) circulates locally to this day.
Bloody Croft alludes to a small former common field called Blood Croft. This used to lie between the present-day golf links to the west, Greenford Avenue to the east, and is partly covered by the northern half of the present-day Grove Avenue, which itself is 1.5 km to the nor-nor west of the burial site. Since ancient times, pigs were let loose into the woods that once stood upon Cuckoo Hill, to feed upon the acorns and roots therein. This practice was even recorded in the Domesday Book entry for Hanwell. Therefore, the name may just allude to the place, where they were then slaughtered during the Saxon lunar &quot;blood month&quot;, which falls around November. &quot;Blotmonað&quot;: blot &quot;blood or a sacrifice&quot;, monað &quot;month.&quot; The English Place-Name Society found in its search of the Hanwell records an earlier name for the field, which was &quot;Blood Cut Meadow&quot;. Their only comment is &quot;possibly &#x27;land on which veterinary phlebotomy was practised.&#x27;&quot;

In 2013 a plaque was unveiled near the Hanwell Clock Tower to honour Jim Marshall, the founder of Marshall Amplification, who opened his first store in Hanwell in 1962. To commemorate the unveiling the nearby pubs hosted a live music festival with local bands and musicians dubbed the Hanwell Hootie. The event was so successful that it was repeated the following year with more pubs taking part, and in 2015 every pub in Hanwell was included, with even some coffee shops and delicatessens joining in. The festival has now become an annual event, with the 2019 edition taking place on 11 May.

==Sport, leisure and media==

Hanwell is represented by Non-League football club Hanwell Town F.C., which plays at the Reynolds Field, in Perivale. Nicknamed &#x27;The Geordies&#x27; the club was formed in 1920 by a group of natives of Newcastle upon Tyne who were working in the Hanwell area, who adopted the famous black and white stripes of Newcastle United as their colours. They play in the Isthmian League South Central Division. There is also an amateur rugby team, Hanwell RFC (Middlesex Merit Table Division 2), who play at Gunnersbury Park.

A community radio station, Westside 89.6FM serves the local area from studios based at Clocktower Mews.

<text>Hanworth is a district of West London, England. Historically in Middlesex, it has been part of the London Borough of Hounslow since 1965. Hanworth adjoins Feltham to the northwest, Twickenham to the northeast and Hampton to the southeast, with Sunbury-on-Thames to the southwest.

The name is thought to come from the Anglo-Saxon words &quot;haen/han&quot; and &quot;worth&quot;, meaning &quot;small homestead&quot;.

==History==
During Edward the Confessor’s time, Hanworth was a sparsely populated manor and parish held by Ulf, a &quot;huscarl&quot; of the King. Huscarls were the bodyguards of Scandinavian Kings and were often the only professional soldiers in the Kingdom. The majority of huscarls in the kingdom were killed at Hastings in 1066, and William the Conqueror granted Hanworth to Robert under Roger de Montgomery, the Earl of Arundel and Shrewsbury. After his death, his second son held the land until his death in the Mowbray conspiracy of 1098, after which it passed to his eldest son, Robert de Bellesme, who also rebelled against the Crown in 1102 with the result that the lands were confiscated.

Towards the end of the 14th century, the manor was occupied by Sir Nicholas Brembre, who was Mayor of London in 1377 and 1378. Sir Nicholas was hanged at Tyburn in 1387, having been accused of treason.

In 1512, Hanworth came to the Crown, and Henry VIII, who enjoyed hunting on the heath surrounding the village, gave the manor to Anne Boleyn for life. After her execution, the manor returned to the King who held it until his death in 1547 but passing to Catherine Parr, who lived in the house with her stepdaughter Princess Elizabeth. When the princess became Queen, she stayed at Hanworth Manor several times, often hunting on the heath.
In 1784, General Sir William Roy, the military draughtsman, supervised the Principal Triangulation of Great Britain project. That measured a base line from King&#x27;s Arbour, across Hounslow Heath passing through Hanworth Park, to Hampton Poor House. This measurement, which earned the General the Copley medal of the Royal Society, was the origin of all subsequent surveys of the United Kingdom, and still forms the basis of the Ordnance Survey maps today.

In 1797, the manor house was destroyed by fire, leaving only the stable block, which survives today as flats, and the coach house, which was converted into homes. &quot;c.&quot; 1799 a new house was built on the same site known as Hanworth House. In 1827 the house and estate of &quot;c.&quot; 680 acres (known as Hanworth Great Park), including three farms was sold outright to Henry Perkins. During the 1830s the current building known as Hanworth Park House was built. This building is currently sitting derelict in the middle of Hanworth Park. A local campaign is running to restore the house.

By the end of the 19th century, William Whiteley, of Whiteleys in Bayswater, had bought of farmland that had previously been Butts and Glebe farms. Renamed Hanworth Farms, these supplied all the produce for the store&#x27;s food hall having been transported daily by horse and cart. Following Whiteley&#x27;s murder by his illegitimate son in 1907, his legitimate sons sold the farm to a jam manufacturer who operated there until selling the land for new homes in 1933.
===Manors===

The Ambassador to Charles I, negotiating the secret treaty of 1631 with Spain, who had good knowledge of the country, was raised to the peerage as Baron Cottington of Hanworth, referring to his Hanworth Park estate, receiving the honour &#x27;at Greenwich in a very solemn manner.&#x27; As the Civil War drew near he declared himself an active Royalist, and after hostilities had broken out he joined the king at Oxford. He was excepted by Parliament from &#x27;indemnity and composition&#x27;, and spent the remainder of his life abroad, dying in Spain in 1652. His estates were assigned in 1649 to John Bradshaw who had earlier insisted on Charles&#x27;s execution and were recovered at the English Restoration by his nephew and heir Charles Cottington who sold it in 1670 to Sir Thomas Chamber.

Chamber died in 1692, and was succeeded by his son Thomas. Thomas Chamber left two daughters and co-heiresses, and Hanworth passed, through agreement on marriage of the elder, to Vere Beauclerk, who was created Baron Vere, of Hanworth in 1750. The manor was inherited by his son and heir, Aubrey, in 1781, who succeeded his cousin as Duke of St. Albans six years later but who sold it shortly after 1802 to James Ramsey Cuthbert. Frederick John Cuthbert was lord of the manor in 1816 from whom it passed to Henry Perkins. After the death of his heir Algernon Perkins it passed to a firm of solicitors, and the main home was acquired in the early part of the next century by Court of Appeal judge turned politician Ernest Murray Pollock, 1st Viscount Hanworth.

===Churches===

====Saint George&#x27;s Church====
Hanworth&#x27;s main parish church is dedicated to Saint George. There has been a church on the site, in Castle Way, since at least the fourteenth century; the church was first mentioned in 1293. The first known rector was Adam de Brome, founder of Oriel College, Oxford, in 1309.

====All Saints&#x27; Church====

In 1935, Hanworth had a jam factory belonging to Whiteley&#x27;s. It was decided that a chapel of ease should be set up. It was founded by Bertram Pollock, Bishop of Norwich, and the Rector of Saint George&#x27;s. Bishop Pollock had been born at Woodlawn, a house in Hanworth, near Hampton Road West, and part of it was used as the chapel.

After the Second World War, in 1947, it was originally decided that a Nissen hut should be used to house the chapel. However, when the architect Nugent Cachemaille-Day was approached, he decided that a proper church should be built, and a site on the opposite side of Hampton Road West was chosen.

The Parish of All Saints was split off from Saint George&#x27;s in 1950, and the foundation stone of the new church was laid on 14 July 1951 by the Bishop of Guildford, Henry Montgomery Campbell, in the presence of Lord Latham, Lord-Lieutenant of Middlesex. The church was finally consecrated on 28 September 1957 by Campbell, who by then was Bishop of London.

The church now also offers an &quot;International Service&quot; in Ukrainian.

====St. Richard&#x27;s Church====

Hanworth&#x27;s third church, St. Richard&#x27;s, was built in 1965 and is located at the end of Forge Lane, near the village boundary with Hampton. It is currently fundraising to completely renovate \ refurbish the church.

===Hanworth Aerodrome===

Hanworth Aerodrome was a grass airfield, operational from 1917 to 1919 and 1929 to 1947. It was located in Hanworth Park, and included the grounds of Hanworth Park House, an 1802 rebuild of Hanworth Palace, but currently empty and disused. It was used as a clubhouse in the 1930s, and more recently as an old people&#x27;s home. In the 1930s, named London Air Park, it was best known as a centre for private flying, society events, aircraft manufactured by General Aircraft Limited (GAL) 1934–1949, and the visit by the Graf Zeppelin airship in 1932. Amelia Earhart flew to Hanworth after landing in Ireland at the end of her 1932 crossing of the Atlantic; Walter Sickert recorded &quot;Miss Earhart&#x27;s Arrival&quot; in a painting now owned by the Tate Gallery. There is a public house nearby named &quot;The Airman&quot; in recognition of its close proximity to the aerodrome, and a large aircraft propeller sculpture marks the site of the General Aircraft factory. Feltham District Council purchased the park in 1956. Feltham Swimming Baths was built on parkland beside the Uxbridge Road in 1965, later refurbished and renamed Feltham Airparcs Leisure Centre. That public sports facility was renamed in 2010 as Hanworth Air Park Leisure Centre &amp; Library

===1970s===
The construction of an elevated M3 feeder road (now part of the A316) in the 1970s cut Hanworth in two; in preparation for this, the library was relocated to &quot;Mount Corner&quot;, so-named for being opposite the Hanworth Park House icehouse mound. Forge Lane Infants and Junior School was built on the south side of the new road, and the war memorial was relocated.
==Sport and leisure==

Hanworth has two Non-League football clubs, Hanworth Villa F.C. who play at Rectory Meadow and play in the Isthmian league and Feltham FC who play at Feltham Rugby Club and play in the Middlesex County Football League. 

Hanworth Air Park is the home of Feltham Rugby Football Club, founded 1947; and a reincarnation of Feltham Football Club, originally founded 1946. 

Hanworth Airpark is also the home of Hanworth Sports FC, since 2002.

Hanworth Air Park Leisure Centre &amp; Library (formerly Feltham Airparcs), also in Hanworth Air Park, has a gym and a swimming pool.

Staines Rugby Football Club The Reeves play home games and train at a rugby ground in Snakey Lane.

==Geography==

===Soil, watercourses and elevation===
Soil in Hanworth varies between gravel close to the surface and a clay-rich loam, with very narrow belts of alluvium closest to the streams. The land is relatively flat and drained by two watercourses heading southward and eastward respectively to meet the Thames in neighbouring historic parishes, the River Crane marking much of the northern border with Twickenham, and the Port Lane stream matching approximately the western boundary. Elevations range from 11m to 16m OD.

<text>Yoshi&#x27;s Cookie is a 1992 tile-matching puzzle video game developed by Tose and published by Nintendo for the NES and Game Boy platforms in 1992. A Super NES version was released the following year, developed and published by Bullet-Proof Software.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Cookie&quot; is a tile-matching video game in which the player is given a playing field populated with cookies of several types, arranged in a rectangular grid. The main objective of each level is to clear the playing field of all the cookies. The player mixes and matches the cookies such that entire rows or columns consist only of cookies of the same type. The player controls a cursor on the grid that is used to rotate individual lines in a manner similar to a Rubik&#x27;s Cube. When a single row or column contains all matching cookies, the row is cleared from the grid. The grid grows in size from cookies entering from the top and right sides of the playing field and a game over occurs when the grid overflows. A sixth cookie type, shaped like Yoshi″s head, occasionally appears that acts as a wild card, used to help clear lines of any other cookie.

===Game modes===
&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Cookie&quot; has different game modes. In the single-player Action Mode, the player completes successive levels that progressively grow more complex. A multiplayer VS Mode has two players competing against each other in split-screen. The Super NES version has a single-player VS Mode in which the player competes against a computer player. The Super NES version also contains a Puzzle Mode in which each level has a predefined grid of cookies and player must clear all the cookies in a maximum number of moves.

==Development==
&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Cookie&quot; originally began development as an arcade game called , which was being produced by game developer Home Data. The arcade game did poorly at the location test, so Home Data sold the &quot;Hermetica&quot; rights to Bullet-Proof Software. Bullet-Proof Software then produced an SNES version, designed by David Nolte. This version was shown at the 1992 Consumer Electronics Show. Nintendo obtained the licenses for the 8-bit (NES and Game Boy) versions of &quot;Hermetica&quot;, and developed the game into &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Cookie&quot;, which now featured &quot;Mario&quot; characters. The soundtrack was composed by Akira Satou, Nobuya Ikuta, Noriko Nishizaka, and Tsutomu, which also features a rendition of Csikós Post, written by German composer Hermann Necke.

While Bullet-Proof Software retained the rights to the original Super NES game, Nintendo licensed the &quot;Mario&quot; characters and allowed the developer to use the &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Cookie&quot; branding. This version was produced by both Nolte and Yasuaki Nagoshi. The levels in the game&#x27;s Puzzle Mode were designed by &quot;Tetris&quot; creator Alexey Pajitnov.

==Release==
&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Cookie&quot; was first released in Japan on November 21, 1992, for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy. Five months later, it was released in North America in April 1993, and in Europe on April 28, 1994.

The Super NES version was released in June 1993 in North America, on July 9, 1993, in Japan, and in Europe during the same year.

===&quot;Yoshi no Cookie: Kuruppon Oven de Cookie&quot;===
National, a brand of Panasonic, released 500 copies of a special limited edition of &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Cookie&quot; for the Super Famicom, titled , which worked with a peripheral called the Kuruppon Oven to show players how to make the cookies in the game. In October 2010, a copy of this edition was valued at ¥157,500 (equivalent to US$1,924 in 2010).

===Remake and emulation===
&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Cookie&quot; was remade and included in the &quot;Nintendo Puzzle Collection&quot; for the GameCube, released in Japan on February 7, 2003. The collection also contained the NES emulated version on the disc that could be transferred to the Game Boy Advance via the GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable. Besides lacking the VS Mode, the GBA version is virtually identical to the original.

The NES emulated version was also re-released for the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console service on April 4, 2008, in Europe and Australia, April 7, 2008, in North America, June 10, 2008, in Japan, and November 11, 2008, in South Korea. It was discontinued from the service on October 11, 2013, in Japan and Europe, and October 18, 2013, in North America.

==Reception==
&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Cookie&quot; received mixed reviews. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; ranked it the 48th best game available on the Game Boy and Game Boy Color. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1993 called the game &quot;simple, but addictive, just like all puzzlers from the Big N. Give &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Cookie&quot; a taste test - but don&#x27;t do it before bedtime. You might have nightmares about that NES coming back to life.&quot; &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; rated &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Cookie&quot; the fifth best NES game of 1993. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked the game 50th on their Top 100 SNES Games.&quot;

<doc id="94052" wikidata="Q2243312" url="?curid=94052" title="Harefield">
<text>Harefield is a village in the London Borough of Hillingdon, England, northwest of Charing Cross near Greater London&#x27;s boundary with Buckinghamshire to the west and Hertfordshire to the north. The population at the 2011 Census was 7,399. Harefield is the westernmost settlement in Greater London, and lies outside the capital&#x27;s contiguous built-up area.

Harefield is near Denham, Ickenham, Northwood, Rickmansworth, Ruislip and Uxbridge. Pioneering heart surgery techniques were developed at Harefield Hospital.

==History==
Two sites near Dewes Farm have produced late Mesolithic artefacts. Harefield enters recorded history through the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; (1086) as &quot;Herefelle&quot;, comprising the Anglo-Saxon words &quot;Here&quot; &quot;[danish] army&quot; (c.f. the English &quot;fyrd&quot;) and &quot;felle&quot; (later &quot;feld&quot;), &quot;field&quot;. Before the Norman conquest of England, the Manor of Harefield belonged to Countess Goda, the sister of Edward the Confessor. Her husbands were French, Dreux of the Vexin and Count Eustace of Boulogne.

Following the Norman conquest, ownership of Harefield passed to Richard FitzGilbert, the son of Count Gilbert of Brionne. It was listed in the Domesday Book as comprising enough arable land for five ploughs, with meadow land only sufficient for one plough. Woodland areas in Middlesex were registered in the number of pigs which could be supported there; Harefield had 1,200, the second highest in the Hundred of Elthorne to Ruislip, with 1,500. Ten villeins (tenants) are also counted; they held their land freely from the lord in exchange for rent payments and labour. By the 12th or 13th century their land is believed to have passed back to the lord and become unfree. There were also seven bordars (poorer tenants) with five acres each, while one had three. In addition, three cottars, who owned a cottage and garden, also feature.

Harefield was eventually split into the main manor of Harefield, and the two smaller submanors of Brackenbury and Moorhall. It had been owned by the Clares, descended from Richard FitzGerald, before passing to the Batchworths by 1235. In turn, the Swanlord family took possession in 1315. By 1446, the Newdigate family owned Harefield - they still owned some land in the 1920s. John Newdigate exchanged most of his land in 1585 with the Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, Sir Edmund Anderson. He sold the manor to Sir Thomas Egerton, who staged an elaborate entertainment for Queen Elizabeth in 1602.

During World War I, Harefield Park was used as an Australian military hospital. The bodies of the servicemen who died there were buried with full military honours within the graveyard of St Mary&#x27;s Church; the area, which also included the ground where the Harefield Place building stood, became a military cemetery.

In 1929 Harefield became part of the Municipal Borough of Uxbridge, then in 1965 the London Borough of Hillingdon.

==Notable buildings==

===Harefield Hospital===
Harefield Hospital is a world-famous heart and lung hospital. It is part of the Royal Brompton &amp; Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, the largest specialist heart and lung centre in the UK, and among the largest in Europe. Its sister hospital in the trust is the Royal Brompton Hospital in Chelsea.

Sir Magdi Yacoub, consultant cardiothoracic surgeon at Harefield Hospital (1969–2002), carried out the first live lobe lung transplant, and went on to perform more transplants than any other surgeon in the world. By the end of the 1980s Harefield Hospital was the leading transplant centre. Magdi Yacoub was involved in the development of heart and heart-lung transplants.

===St Mary the Virgin Church===
St Mary&#x27;s Parish Church (off Church Hill) is Harefield&#x27;s oldest building and an important focal point for the Harefield community. A priest is first mentioned in the manor of Harefield in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; (1086). In the late 12th century the advowson was given to the Knights Hospitallers, although the Newdigate family later became patrons of the church. The church building has some medieval features, but was restored and altered in 1768, and again in 1841.

The church cemetery contains the graves of over 100 soldiers of the First Australian Imperial Force who died at No. 1 Australian Auxiliary Hospital (Harefield Park Hospital) after being wounded in World War I. The hospital became Harefield prior to World War II. Each year on Anzac Day a commemoration service is attended by local dignitaries, representatives from the Australian and New Zealand governments, local school children and many retired servicemen. Following the church service the congregation move to the cemetery and form around the Anzac memorial. The last post and reveille are played, followed by a wreath-laying ceremony. Local school children also place flowers on the well-kept grave sites.

The church holds the tomb in which Alice Stanley, Dowager Countess of Derby was laid to rest in January 1637. Dowager Stanley was a Spencer, from Althorp in Northamptonshire, of the family to which Diana Princess of Wales belonged. She was the widow of Ferdinando, 5th Earl of Derby, who had been poisoned because of his closeness to the throne of England. Very soon after Ferdinando&#x27;s murder in 1594 Alice had to move out of Lathom and Knowsley in Lancashire. She came to live at Harefield Place in considerable splendour. The house stood to the south of the present church and parts of its moat and brickwork can still be seen.

Alice, Dowager Countess of Derby was also Dowager Viscountess Brackley. Her second husband Thomas Egerton, Lord Ellesmere, an eminent lawyer and Lord Chancellor of England, had died in 1617. But the Derby title was the one she preferred to be known by, and it is the one by which she is described on her funeral monument, which is surely one of the finest of its time anywhere in England. The mourning daughters beside the tomb are not meant to be lifelike representations of her actual daughters, Anne, Frances and Elizabeth; they conform to a stereotype often observed on grand monuments of this kind. But the figure of Alice Countess of Derby is probably closer to historical reality. She wears the coronet of a Countess, not a Viscountess, and at the foot of her tomb is a coroneted eagle, a reminder of the Stanleys&#x27; armorial crest. This commemorates their descent from the Lathoms, which was the foundation of their fortunes.

Sir Michael Shersby, MP for Uxbridge from 1972 to 1997, is buried in the churchyard along with his widow Lady Barbara.

===Manor of Harefield===
The ancient Manor of Harefield was held by the Newdigate family from about 1440. The old Manor house, Harefield Place, adjacent to St Mary the Virgin church, was replaced in 1786, when a new mansion house was built at Harefield Lodge. The old &#x27;Harefield Place&#x27; fell into disrepair and was demolished in 1813, whereupon the new Manor house became known as Harefield Place. It was sold by Charles Newdigate Newdegate in 1877. In 1938 it was acquired by the local authority to serve as a hospital. In 1959 the land was redeveloped and is now the Harefield Place Golf Club.

Harefield House, a Grade II listed building, High Street, Harefield, was built by Sir Roger Newdigate in about 1750. From about 1765 to 1809 it was occupied by J. M. Bruhl. During World War I it served as No. 1 Australian Auxiliary Hospital. In 1937 it was acquired by the Ministry of Defence and was occupied by the Aeronautical Inspection Directorate. 

After 1982 the building was restored and converted to office use. In 2015 the building was used as the filming location for the interior of the island mansion in the TV adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s mystery novel &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;.

Breakspear House (Breakspears), a Grade I listed building, originally constructed in the 17th century also falls within Harefield.

===The Harefield Academy===
The Harefield Academy replaced the John Penrose School in September 2005. The new academy is an age 11 to 18 school with accommodation for 750 students aged 11 to 15 and a further 250 post-16 students.

The School is set in the village of Harefield on the edge of the green belt and is adjacent to the commencement of agricultural land.

The Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF), a number of directors of Watford Football Club, and the London Borough of Hillingdon worked together to seek to bring about a significant improvement in educational and health standards.

The Harefield Academy project is part of the Government&#x27;s Academies initiative.

==Sport==
Harefield is home to Harefield United Football Club, which was founded in 1868 and is the oldest in Middlesex.

Harefield is home to Harefield Cricket Club, whose first and second teams play their matches at the Woods Cricket Ground on Breakspear Road North. In 2008, however, the Dairy Farm Ground (behind the current first team pitch) was opened in order to accommodate the third and fourth XIs. This was done in conjunction with the Harefield Parochial Charity. In 2009, the first XI achieved promotion to the Home Counties Cricket League, and are therefore one division away from the highest level of club cricket in England and Wales. In 2010, HCC had the most successful season in its history, with the second, third &amp; fourth XI&#x27;s all winning their respective leagues. The Sunday Academy side won their division of the Chess Valley League. The 2014 season saw the first XI play their first season in the Premier Division and after a protracted relegation battle, they survived on the last game of season. A second season in the top flight secured their status as the highest ranked club in the area.

Harefield is also home to an Elite Gymnastics Academy. The Harefield Academy, Northwood Road, opened in September 2005 on the John Penrose School site.

<text>Tetris Attack, also known as in Japan, is a puzzle video game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. A Game Boy version was released a year later. In the game, the player must arrange matching colored blocks in vertical or horizontal rows to clear them. The blocks steadily rise towards the top of the playfield, with new blocks being added at the bottom. Several gameplay modes are present, including a time attack and multiplayer mode.

&quot;Tetris Attack&quot; was first released as &quot;Panel de Pon&quot; in Japan in October 1995, featuring fairies as the main characters with a mythical, fantasy setting. The game was released outside Japan in 1996, with the original characters and settings replaced by those from &quot;Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;. Though international releases have the name &quot;Tetris Attack&quot;, the game bears no relation to the &quot;Tetris&quot; video game series, leading Tetris Company co-founder Henk Rogers to regret giving Nintendo the license to use the name. Both &quot;Panel de Pon&quot; and &quot;Tetris Attack&quot; were later broadcast through the Japan-only Satellaview peripheral, the latter renamed to 

&quot;Tetris Attack&quot; was well received by critics for its graphical style, addictive gameplay and multiplayer modes, with some noting the North American version was superior to the original Japanese release. It was followed by a series of sequels and remakes for multiple platforms, most of which instead use the name &quot;Puzzle League&quot;. The game is referenced in other Nintendo games, such as the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, &quot;Animal Crossing: New Leaf&quot;, and &quot;Captain Rainbow&quot;.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Tetris Attack&quot; is a puzzle video game. The player must use an on-screen cursor to arrange colored blocks into horizontal or vertical rows – matching together three or more blocks of the same color will destroy them. Any blocks above cleared lines will fall, which can be used to cause chain reactions if they touch other matching blocks. The player can also earn combos, clearing more than three blocks in a single move. As the stage progresses, the blocks will begin to rise steadily towards the top of the screen, with new blocks generating from the bottom. Should the blocks touch the top of the playfield, the game will be over.

Several different gameplay modes are included. Story Mode pits the player against a series of computer-controlled opponents. In Endless Mode, the player is challenged to play as long as possible with a continuously rising stack of blocks, which increases in speed over time. Timed Mode challenges the player to score as many points as possible within a two-minute time limit. Stage Clear mode takes the player through a series of stages, in which the objective is to clear all blocks underneath a &quot;boundary&quot; line. In Puzzle Mode, the player must clear all the blocks in a preset block arrangement in a set number of moves – the blocks here do not rise towards the top. Several multiplayer modes are also present with adjustable difficulty levels.

==Development and release==

&quot;Tetris Attack&quot; was released in Japan on October 27, 1995, August 1996 in North America, and November 28, 1996, in Europe. Development was headed by Intelligent Systems and produced by Gunpei Yokoi, known as the creator of the Game Boy. The Japanese version of the game is titled &quot;Panel de Pon&quot;, featuring fairies as the main characters with a fantasy setting. International versions instead replace these with characters and settings from &quot;Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;, a game released earlier in 1995. Though international releases have the name &quot;Tetris Attack&quot;, the game has no relation to the &quot;Tetris&quot; video game franchise, leading to Tetris Company co-founder Henk Rogers saying in a 2009 interview he regrets giving Nintendo permission to using the name. Although Rogers liked the game, he believed it &quot;got lost in history&quot; due to it using the &quot;Tetris&quot; branding.

A Game Boy version of &quot;Tetris Attack&quot; was released in 1996. Two years later, in 1998, a special version of &quot;Panel de Pon&quot; was broadcast through the Satellaview peripheral for the Super Famicom in Japan, renamed &quot;BS Panel de Pon – Event &#x27;98&quot; as part of a contest by St. GIGA. &quot;Tetris Attack&quot; was later released for the Satellaview the same year, renamed &quot;BS Yoshi no Panepon&quot;. The original &quot;Panel de Pon&quot; was digitally re-released for the Japanese Wii Virtual Console on November 27, 2007. The original version of &quot;Tetris Attack&quot; was added to the Nintendo Switch Online service on May 20, 2020, under its Japanese title &quot;Panel de Pon&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Tetris Attack&quot; was met with very positive reviews, earning a 90% average rating on GameRankings. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave it an 8.25 out of 10, lauding the addictive gameplay, colorful and cartoony graphics, use of Mario characters in the North American localization, and two-player mode. &quot;GamePro&quot; gave it a perfect 5 out of 5 in graphics, control and FunFactor, and a 4.5 out of 5 in sound. The reviewer commented that it has &quot;a gentler, slower style of gameplay that requires learning some easy new controls, but this game&#x27;s no less addicting than the original &quot;Tetris&quot;.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; called it &quot;absolutely brilliant&quot;. 

&quot;GamePro&quot; gave the Game Boy version a brief positive review, saying it &quot;updates the age-old &quot;Tetris&quot; concept by inverting the basic action&quot;.

===Accolades===
&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; editors named &quot;Tetris Attack&quot; Super NES Game of the Year, Hand-Held Game of the Year, and Puzzle Game of the Year, commenting that &quot;[T]he simple premise makes it a game of mass appeal; its depth makes it a hardcore gamer&#x27;s delight.&quot; In 1997 &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; editors ranked the Super NES version the 16th best console video game of all time. They cited its accessibility and addictive quality, confessing that their boss had confiscated the office copy of the game because of how much time they spent playing it. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; listed it 87th on their list of &quot;The 100 best games of all time&quot;, stating &quot;you haven&#x27;t lived until you&#x27;ve played &quot;Tetris Attack&quot; two-player and dropped an immensely satisfying five-line garbage block on your opponent.&quot; &quot;Game Informer&quot; featured it on its own best games of all-time list at 96 and called it one of the most addictive puzzle games made. In 2018, &quot;Complex&quot; listed the game #64 on its &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Tetris Attack&quot; was followed by several sequel games, most using the name &quot;Puzzle League&quot; in western territories. The first of these were &quot;Pokémon Puzzle Challenge&quot; for the Game Boy Color and &quot;Pokémon Puzzle League&quot; for the Nintendo 64 in 2000, featuring characters from the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime series. A previously unreleased sequel, &quot;Panel de Pon 64&quot;, was later released as part of &quot;Nintendo Puzzle Collection&quot; for the GameCube in 2003, followed by &quot;Dr. Mario &amp; Puzzle League&quot; for the Game Boy Advance in 2005. &quot;Planet Puzzle League&quot; was released for the Nintendo DS in 2007 (renamed to &quot;Panel de Pon DS&quot; in Japan and &quot;Puzzle League DS&quot; in Europe), featuring online multiplayer support via the now-defunct Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service and touch-screen controls. A similar game for DSiWare, &quot;Puzzle League Express&quot;, was released in 2010 for the Nintendo DSi with many of the same features as &quot;Planet&quot;.

Several Nintendo games reference &quot;Tetris Attack&quot; and &quot;Panel de Pon&quot;. The &quot;Lip&#x27;s Stick&quot;, the primary weapon of the main character of &quot;Panel de Pon&quot;, appears throughout the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series since &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, poisoning the opponent. &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; features multiple &quot;Panel de Pon 64&quot; characters and a red-colored block as collectible stickers. A remix of Lip&#x27;s theme song appears in multiple series entries, beginning with &quot;Brawl,&quot; where it can be played on the stage &quot;PictoChat&quot; in &quot;Brawl&quot;, &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot; in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Wii U&quot;, and on any miscellaneous Nintendo series stage in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. Lip appears in the Japan-only Wii game &quot;Captain Rainbow&quot; and as a Spirit and Mii Fighter costume in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. A 2016 update to &quot;Animal Crossing: New Leaf&quot; adds a minigame based on the &quot;Puzzle League&quot; series, titled &quot;Animal Crossing Puzzle League&quot;.

&quot;Panel de Pon&quot; was included solely in Japan as part of the 21 games rereleased on the Super Famicom Mini on October 5, 2017, and was made available internationally on the Nintendo Switch Online service on May 20, 2020.

<doc id="94058" wikidata="Q146335" url="?curid=94058" title="Harlesden">
<text>Harlesden is a district in the London Borough of Brent, north-west London.

Located north of the Grand Union Canal and Wormwood Scrubs, the Harrow Road flows through the centre of the area which goes eastwards to Central London and west towards Wembley. Harlesden was historically in the Municipal Borough of Willesden before the creation of Brent; it lies within Willesden&#x27;s postal district of NW10. Harlesden has been praised for its vibrant Caribbean culture and unofficially named London&#x27;s reggae capital for its contributions to the musical genre. The town centre contains a large number of multicultural independent businesses, while industry exists by the canal, most notably a McVitie&#x27;s biscuit factory that has been operating since 1902. The population includes people of Afro-Caribbean heritage most notably, as well as Irish, Portuguese, Brazilian, Somali, and smaller Latin American and East African groups within the community.

==History==
Harlesden was once a Saxon settlement. The Domesday Book calls it &quot;Hervlvestvne&quot;. For centuries the area was a small rural community set in orchards with some inns.

In the 19th century, Harlesden, then a rural village in the parish of Willesden, began to develop some of its urban appearance with the arrival of the railways. Willesden Junction, Kensal Green and Harlesden stations on the London &amp; Birmingham Railway all had an effect on the developing village. Cottages for railway and industrial workers were built, as was grander housing for the local middle class. The London–Harrow coach passed through the village every day by 1839. The village gained a blacksmith, grocer and a shoemaker during this period.
Harlesden increasingly lost its rural nature, with factories replacing farms and woodland. Sewerage arrived here in 1871 and soon houses were being built. A mainly middle class population resided here who enjoyed the availability of numerous churches, cinemas, a court, a library and recreational pleasure at Roundwood Park. From late Victorian times until the 1930s, housing completed its spread across the area, and Harlesden became part of the London conurbation. A jubilee clock tower was built in 1888. Harlesden gained excellent transport links by the train stations as well as a frequent horse bus service to Paddington as early as 1890. Electric trams came to Harlesden in 1907. That year also saw the opening of Willesden Hippodrome Theatre, which was destroyed by German bombing in 1940. Much of the working class in Harlesden suffered from poverty, with the &quot;Willesden Chronicle&quot; mentioning &quot;nearness to starvation&quot; of those people in 1908.

In 1908, the Olympic Games were held in London. The marathon race course went through Harlesden, and ended at the White City Stadium. The course entered Harlesden via Craven Park Road, turned down Manor Park Road, down the High Street and passed the Jubilee Clock. After that, the course headed towards North Acton via Station Road and passing Willesden Junction.

Mainly after World War I, one of Europe&#x27;s biggest industrial estates was constructed at nearby Park Royal, and large factories there and within Harlesden included McVitie &amp; Price (later United Biscuits) from 1910, and Heinz from 1919. Industrial growth led to a middle class exodus as Harlesden turned entirely into a working class area in the inter-war period. The McVitie &amp; Price factory became the largest biscuit factory in the western world, employing 2,600 people by 1978. 
By 1939 the last of the really large Victorian houses, Roundwood House and Knowles Tower, had both been demolished by Willesden Council. At 6am on 16 January 1939, the Irish Republican Army blew up the Harlesden electricity cable bridge. The bridge crossed the Grand Junction Canal, and carried the power line from Battersea Power Station. No one was injured in the attack. In the interwar period, a cargo ship, built on Tyneside, was named after the area. In 1941, the ship was sunk by the German battle cruiser Gneisenau, approximately 600 miles west of Newfoundland. Seven members of the crew were killed.

In the 1950s, the transport of coal from Durham and steel from Sheffield became a main contributor to the local economy, these industries employed a mass of labour from Irish and Jamaican immigrants.
The image of Harlesden today began to take shape in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Continued immigration from Ireland and new immigration from the Caribbean and the Indian sub-continent changed the racial and cultural make up of the area. Despite the immigration the population of Harlesden still declined from 39,527 in 1951 to 26,970 in 1971, but remained densely populated. Prefab homes for those made homeless by Second World War bombings were still in existence by the end of the 1960s.

By the 1960s, the Curzon Crescent estate was known for poverty and became a vandalism hotspot. At the same time, immigration from the West Indies and Indian sub-continent led to racist articles in a national newspaper. Poverty increased further by the decline of industry and the building of Brent Cross Shopping Centre. Steps were taken to improve the area, such as the Harlesden City Challenge community project in the 1990s that involved the creation of public artwork in the area, as well as the renovation of the jubilee clock on the High Street in 1997. More recently from the end of the 20th century the area has become home to Brazilian, Portuguese and Somali communities, as well as Polish, Afghan and Colombian communities.

Prince Charles visited Harlesden in March 2007. He commented &quot;I don&#x27;t think I have enjoyed myself so much for a long time going down the high street and popping into one or two shops. I&#x27;m sorry I couldn&#x27;t go into more of them.&quot;

The fortunes of Harlesden have been on the up more recently. Reduced crime rates have led to higher house prices, but the district retains a non-gentrified atmosphere. In 2015 a new community &quot;Town Garden&quot; was opened for locals to garden, socialise and exercise, established by the funding of local volunteers and charities. It has become a green sanctuary in the heart of Harlesden.

==Amenities==
The diversity of Harlesden is apparent in the high street which houses various businesses such as the likes of Afro-Caribbean hair and beauty shops, Somali restaurants, Portuguese bakeries and Brazilian cafes.

===All Souls church===

The Church of All Souls is on Station Road in Harlesden. It was designed in 1879 by E.J. Tarver and is a Grade II* listed building.

===Jubilee Clock===
Harlesden&#x27;s jubilee clock was erected in 1888 which commemorates Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee.

===Roundwood Park===

Roundwood Park is the main public open space and park in Harlesden.

===Willesden County Court===
Located on Acton Lane, the current Willesden County Court was built in 1970.

===Our Lady of Willesden===

Our Lady of Willesden Church is a Roman Catholic church, with devotion to Our Lady of Willesden and was the first mission to cater for a growing Irish population in the late 19th century, although the current church was built in 1931.

=== Harlesden House ===
This is a government building, constructed in 1960, that currently contains a Jobcentre Plus office. The site was previously occupied by the Willesden Hippodrome; a Music Hall and Variety Theatre. It was designed by the theatre architect Frank Matcham, opening on 16 September 1907. The Theatre had seating for 3,500 people. The Theatre was destroyed in 1940 during an air raid.

==Demography==

The 2011 census results for Harlesden ward counted a population of 17,162. In 2011, 71.4% of homes were apartments across the ward, 15.8% of homes were terraced houses, 8.6% semi-detached houses and 4% detached houses; with 0.1% of the homes mobile or temporary structures. Most of the terraces are pre-1920s and the flats converted from them. Many of the flats date to after 2000. Non-mixed use terraces and private sector built apartments are the main housing types that attract high prices from private sector owner-occupiers unable to afford similar properties in nearby Kensal Green and Queen&#x27;s Park.

Harlesden is ethnically diverse. 67% of the population identified themselves as being BAME (Black, Asian and minority Ethnic) at the 2011 census in the Harlesden ward. Ethnically, 19% of the population was Black Caribbean, followed by 19% Black African (both including those of mixed heritage), 15% Other White, and 14% White British. The main spoken foreign languages were Portuguese and Somali.

===Crime===
In the late 1990s, Harlesden and the nearby Stonebridge estate, witnessed a high number of murders and became a crime hotspot, because of several rival yardie gangs. During this time Harlesden turned into one of London&#x27;s main crack cocaine trading centres, and one of the yardies&#x27; strongholds. In 2001 the area reportedly had the highest murder rate in Britain, with 26 shooting incidents that year alone. Through community projects and better policing, crime rates were significantly reduced throughout the 2000s. Crime rates fell at Stonebridge in 2002 and residents reported better living conditions in 2005.

During the nationwide riots of 2011, some shops in Harlesden were attacked by looters.

==Culture and &quot;reggae capital&quot;==

Harlesden and some of its surroundings in Brent played a key part in the development of the reggae music business in the UK. In the 1960s Planetone Studios Sonny Roberts the heartbeat of Rhythm &amp; Blues and Ska recordings, releasing and distribution followed by Trojan Records who became a major reggae label, producing successful artists within and in Jamaica, such as Desmond Dekker and Toots and the Maytals, and numerous top 20 UK singles during the 1970s. Another popular label of reggae and other black music was Jet Star, which called itself &quot;the world&#x27;s largest reggae distributors&quot;.

The Brent Black Music Cooperative Rehearsal Studios was set up in Willesden in 1983 by a grant from Brent council. It provided a studio and training for numerous local and international acts such as The Last Poets and Aswad. In 1970, Sonny Roberts established the first specialist record shop called Orbitone Records, retailing various genres of music but in the mid 1970s became the hub premises for producing, licensing and distributing soca music. During the mid 1970s and 1980s, dozens of record shops filled the Harlesden streets of Church Road, Craven Park Road and the High Street. As of 2020, two still remain in operation on Craven Park Road: Hawkeye and Starlight Records. Numerous pirate radio stations also operated in the area, being very influential to local black artists.

The Cimarons, England&#x27;s first home-grown reggae roots band, was formed in 1969 at Tavistock community centre in Harlesden. Numerous reggae artists lived or live in or around Harlesden, including Dennis Brown (on Hazeldean Road), Janet Kay, General Levy, Jimmy Cliff, Bob Marley (on The Circle, Neasden), Liz Mitchell of Boney M (on Wrottesley Road), and others.

The 1998 musical film &quot;Babymother&quot;, produced by Channel 4 Films, is set in Harlesden and captures the black dancehall culture in the area. &quot;A London Safari: Walking Adventures in NW10&quot; is a 2014 paperback book authored by local Rose Rouse about Harlesden.

More recently, Harlesden has produced known hip hop and grime artists such as K Koke, Nines and George The Poet.

==Media==
The Beat London (formerly known as BANG Radio) is a licensed radio station that broadcasts urban music and cultural programmes from Harlesden High Street. It broadcasts on 103.6 FM throughout north-west London. Numerous unlicensed stations broadcast in and around North West London from reggae and other genres, including Radio RJR 98.3 FM, UK Roots 95.4 FM and Omega Radio 104.1 FM.

Brent&#x27;s largest newspaper is the &quot;Brent &amp; Kilburn Times&quot;.

<text>Harlington is a district of Hayes in the London Borough of Hillingdon and one of five historic parishes partly developed into London Heathrow Airport and associated businesses, the one most heavily developed being Harmondsworth. It is centred west of Charing Cross. The district adjoins Hayes to the north and shares a railway station with the larger district, which is its post town, on the Great Western Main Line. It is in the west of the county of Greater London and until 1965 it was in the south-west corner of the historic county of Middlesex.
==Etymology==
The place-name &quot;Harlington&quot; is recorded in Anglo-Saxon as &quot;Hygereding tun&quot;: &quot;Hygered&#x27;s people&#x27;s farmstead&quot;.

==History==

The earliest surviving mention of Harlington appears to be in a 9th-century charter in which land at Botwell in Hayes was said to be bounded on the west by &quot;Hygeredington&quot; and &quot;Lullinges&quot; tree. The first of these must be Harlington; the second has not been identified.
The boundary between Hayes and Harlington, which may thus have been defined by the date of this charter, was later marked by North Hyde Road and Dawley Road, but Dawley Road may not have followed the boundary before the 18th century.

===Administrative history===
By 1834 the select vestry (informally known simply as the vestry) employed a paid assistant overseer. In 1824 a surgeon for the poor of Cranford and Harlington was appointed by the vestries of both. Their later co-operation saw the establishment of Harlington&#x27;s National School jointly with in 1848, and its cottage hospital jointly with Cranford and Harmondsworth in 1884.

In 1924 the civil parish council (CPC) asked Staines Rural District Council (RDC) to light the village street and this was done a year later. The cemetery in Cherry Lane was opened in 1936 by the UDC and the CPC started its first allotments in 1895, but they rejected proposals to acquire a recreation ground or parish hall.
See the entry for Hayes for the later detailed local history.

===Sanitation===
The chief task from 1872 for local government was the making of sewers in villages beyond a handful of homes such as this. Sewerage had been discussed in the vestry as long ago as 1864. The increase of population in the 20th century, growing preference for flush toilets and prohibitions on ground water contamination made the need for proper sanitation more urgent. In 1912, for instance, there were said to have been eleven cases of typhoid near the &#x27;White Hart&#x27;, and there was an outbreak of diphtheria in 1916.

During the 1920s the RDC made plans for constructing sewers, and the relative cost of their scheme and of schemes proposed by Hayes Urban District Council largely influenced the parish council&#x27;s views on local government reorganisation. In the end the council seem to have acquiesced peacefully in the amalgamation with Hayes that took place in 1930, only on the grounds that this seemed to provide the best and cheapest chance of sewers being constructed soon. A sewerage scheme for the parish was completed by Hayes and Harlington Urban District Council in 1934.

==Present day==

Harlington Library is towards the north of the village/district.

The village contains six public houses: Captain Morgans&#x27;, The Great Western, The Pheasant, The Red Lion, The Wheatsheaf, and The White Hart. There are two churches, a Baptist church and a Church of England church, St Peter &amp; St Paul&#x27;s. Schools include Harlington School.

Hellenic Imperial Airways has its United Kingdom offices in Axis House in Harlington. Harlington Locomotive Society on the High Street of the village - operates a trestle railway around the site of an old orchard. Harlington is covered by a community radio station: 91.8 Hayes FM, which is licensed with the national authority.

===Churches===
* S.S. Peter and Paul, contains, inter alia, sculpture by Edgar Boehm, Richard Cockle Lucas, William Theed and Inigo Thomas, and glass by Charles Eamer Kempe, Arthur Louis Moore and Thomas Willement.

The glebe was absorbed into the land of Sir John Bennet of Dawley, who held the benefice during the Interregnum.

==Historic transport==
The Grand Junction Canal runs through the Dawley land, east to west: it was constructed c. 1794–1800.
In the late 1830s the main line of the Great Western Railway was also built across the former Dawley Park (by then Dawley Wall Farm). However, Hayes &amp; Harlington railway station (just outside the parish) was not opened until 1864. Before then there was a choice of the stations at West Drayton and Southall, or of the daily omnibus and weekly carrier to London.

A road going south-east towards Hatton was removed because of Heathrow&#x27;s construction. The road along with Harlington High Street were formerly designated A312 until the 1950s.

==Former cottage hospital==

The Harlington, Harmondsworth and Cranford Cottage Hospital, in Sipson Lane, opened in 1884, demolished and closed in 1977. Its site hosts a branch of the Sant Nirankari Satsang Bhawan.

=== Listed buildings ===
===Former listed buildings in the parish===
Manor Farm was demolished between 1930 and 1940 and pre-dated the possibility of statutory listing. It is the site of shops in Manor Parade and adjoining residential roads.

==Notable people==
* John Derby Allcroft, glove manufacturer and philanthropist. Lived at Harlington Lodge;
* English statesman Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington (1618–1685), part of Charles II&#x27;s Cabal, was born in (and took his title from) Harlington. And his elder brother Sir John Bennet, KB, 1st Lord Ossulston. Their grandfather was Sir John Bennet (died 1627), who had bought the manor of Dawley from the heirs of Sir Ambrose Coppinger in 1607. In 1649 Sir John Bennet owned around of the parish including Dawley House and four farm-houses. In 1692 the family estate measured around 540 acres, and 602 in the early 18th century. Charles Bennet, 2nd Earl of Tankerville sold the manor of Dawley in 1725; A monumental inscription in the church features Sir John Bennet, KB, Lord Ossulston, and his wives Elizabeth, daughter of Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex and widow of Edmund Sheffield, 2nd Earl of Mulgrave (died 1658), along with his second wife Bridget, daughter of John Howe;

Bolingbroke bought Dawley for £22,000 in 1724, moved there in 1725. With help from Charles Bridgeman he worked on the 400 acres of park and 20 acres of garden, making a ferme ornée, while James Gibbs beautified the house. He sold it in 1737, or 1738, for £26,0000 to Edward Stephenson (1691–1768), MP for Sudbury 1734–41, and for two days Governor of Fort William, 1728, who passed it on again soon after 1748;

Coincidentally, in 1779 Tattersall bought for £2500, for the purpose of breeding, 2nd Lord Bolingbroke&#x27;s unbeaten Highflyer. Operations at Dawley were continued after his death by various other Tattersalls including his son George I (1792–1853), and perhaps grandson George II (1817–1849): thoroughbred stallion Glencoe (1831–1857) stood at stud there in 1835.

Henry Jerome, his daughter, wife, parents, one brother, and nephew were all buried in the family vault in Harlington&#x27;s churchyard. Peter de Salis (1738-1807) acquired the site of Dawley House in 1797. In 1841 members of the de Salis family (Peter Fane de Salis (1799-1870) and his step-mother and half-brothers) owned together 533 acres in the parish. Most of this lay in the north, in or near the former park, but it also included Dawley Manor Farm, in the High Street, The Gramophone Company (then Electric and Musical Industries Ltd.) acquired the site of Dawley House from Cecil Fane de Salis for an extension to their works across the road in 1929;

==Sport==
A greyhound racing track was opened during the 1930s, off the Bath Road. The racing was independent (that is, not affiliated to the National Greyhound Racing Club, the sport&#x27;s governing body) and was therefore a flapping track (the nickname given to independent tracks). In 1959 plans for two large hotels, the Skyways (now Sheraton) and the Ariel (now Holiday Inn), to serve Heathrow were revealed, which resulted in the track being demolished: the last meeting was on 22 January 1962. The track stood very near to where the Holiday Inn is today.

<text>Harmondsworth is a village in the London Borough of Hillingdon in the county of Greater London with a short border to the south onto London Heathrow Airport and close to the Berkshire county border. The village has no railway stations, but adjoins the M4 motorway and the A4 road (the Bath Road). Harmondsworth was in the historic county of Middlesex until 1965. It is an ancient parish that once included the large hamlets of Heathrow, Longford and Sipson. Longford and Sipson have modern signposts and facilities as separate villages, remaining to a degree interdependent such as for schooling. The Great Barn and parish church are medieval buildings in the village. The largest proportion of land in commercial use is related to air transport and hospitality. The village includes public parkland with footpaths and abuts the River Colne and biodiverse land in its Regional Park to the west, once the grazing meadows and woodlands used for hogs of Colnbrook.

The west of the parish has two major airline headquarters (international and local) and two immigration detention centres: the larger is for a maximum of 620 men without leave (permission) to enter or remain in the United Kingdom. Many international visitors stay within the church-based bounds of Harmondsworth, as all hotels are branded as &quot;Heathrow&quot;, a former hamlet and other farmsteads that were absorbed by the airport.

In October 2016 it was announced by HM Government that Heathrow Airport would receive permission to apply for a third runway. According to current expansion plans, around half of the existing village of Harmondsworth will have to be demolished to make way for the north-west runway and surrounding grass safety area. The other half, including the parish church and Great Barn, will be only a few metres from the airport perimeter.

== History ==
Harmondsworth is mentioned in Domesday Book, its name coming from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Heremōdes worþ&quot;, meaning &quot;Heremōd&#x27;s enclosure&quot;, or &quot;Heremundes worþ&quot;, meaning &quot;Heremund&#x27;s enclosure&quot;.

Harmondsworth remains an ecclesiastical parish, with the name first recorded in AD 780 when King Offa granted land to his servant Aeldred.

Before 1066 the manor was owned by Harold Godwinson (Earl Harold), and at the Conquest (1066) it passed to William I. In 1069 it was granted by the king, on the suggestion of William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford ( – 1071), to the Benedictine Abbey of Holy Trinity, Rouen, afterwards known as St. Catherine&#x27;s, which held it in 1086 and then until 1391.



The manor and advowson (this grant did not include the knight&#x27;s fees held in the king&#x27;s hands nor the property farmed out by the priory), together with those of Tingewick (Buckinghamshire), were acquired from the abbey and prior in 1391 by William of Wykeham, Bishop of Winchester, and formed part of the endowment of Winchester College and New College, Oxford, aka &quot;St. Mary College of Winchester in Oxford&quot;. Winchester College and New College retained the manor until 1543 when it was surrendered to Henry VIII in exchange for property elsewhere.

In 1547 the lordship and manor was granted to William Paget, 1st Baron Paget, KG, PC.
The Pagets held on to the manor until the eighteenth century, selling most of early during the time of the heir of Henry Paget, 2nd Earl of Uxbridge (1719–1769), Henry Bayley-Paget, 1st Earl of Uxbridge (1744–1812). William, Lord Paget (1609–1678) sold some of it in 1672. Via his daughter Penelope Foley the Pagets were ancestors of Charles Darwin.
 
Harmondsworth as an ancient parish of 30 hides (as assessed at Domesday, 1086) or (rather than today&#x27;s surviving village nucleus) changed from agrarian and a few, isolated London suburban homes to mostly industrial gradually in 1929 with the opening of the Colnbrook by-pass which by-passed diminutive Longford to the north.

Harmondsworth civil parish from its 1880s creation until its 1964 abolition contained the same areas as its religious counterpart. Industrial development began in 1930 with the opening of the Road Research Laboratory (RRL) on this road. In the same year, the Fairey Aviation Company opened an airfield, the Great West Aerodrome, south-west of Heathrow. This formed the nucleus of the later airport, and the Fairey hangar was eventually incorporated into Heathrow Airport as a fire station.

By the late 1930s some residential building had taken place, although almost entirely in the northern half of the parish. Small estates were built off Hatch Lane around Candover Close and Zealand Avenue and further building took place along Sipson Road, around Blunts Avenue, and along the north side of the Bath Road at Sipson Green. Longford remained virtually untouched. A brick-works was established by the corner of Cain&#x27;s Lane and Heathrow Road and the area of former heathland was extensively worked for gravel, sand, and grit. In the 1930s Middlesex County Council opened a large sewage pumping station to the west of Perry Oaks, which was converted to Heathrow Terminal 5 in the early 21st century. The Great South West Road touched the south-east corner of the parish but played no part in its development. Although many of the orchards survived, their numbers had been greatly reduced and it seems probable that much of the former fruit-growing area was being used for market gardening. In 1944 Harmondsworth and Sipson retained their agricultural character despite some suburban housing. It was then suggested that further expansion in the Yiewsley and West Drayton area should be curtailed, as the land was primarily in demand for agriculture, which was greatly adhered to until 1971.
In 1944, however, the modern pattern of Harmondsworth began to emerge with the transfer of the Fairey airfield to the Royal Air Force and its subsequent development by the Air Ministry as Heathrow R.A.F. station. This entailed the complete demolition of Heathrow and Perry Oaks hamlets, and widespread draining of the old flooded gravel pits. Many of the small buildings along the south side of the Bath Road that were still standing in 1960 were erected by the R.A.F.

Although not a post town, in printed form Harmondsworth is frequently seen in books. From 1937 the offices and warehouses of Penguin Books were here until their gradual closure in the 1990s. In this period its books published in the country bore the publication location, &quot;Harmondsworth, Middlesex&quot;.

In 1965 it became part of the London Borough of Hillingdon in the newly formed ceremonial county of Greater London.

==Proceedings of court, 26 July 1245==
==Henry III Fine Rolls==
Fine rolls of Henry III.
*(13 January 1250): &quot;For the abbot of Rouen. The abbot of Sainte-Trinité-du-mont-de-Rouen gives the king £10 for having seisin of the manor of Harmondsworth after the death of the abbot of the same place, his predecessor.&quot;

==Priors of the alien priory of S. Catherine du Mont, Harmondsworth==
*William, occurs 1260
*John de Walemond, occurs 1276 
*Richard, occurs 1279 
*William de Bosco alias de Yvelont, occurs 1297 
*John de Ibelound
*Humphrey le Conte-Poyntour, occurs 1317 
*John de Fraunkevyle, occurs 1321 
*William de Pestlamore, occurs 1329 
*John Busot(is)
*Roger Sorel, occurs 1342, 1345; recently dead in 1351 
*John Cibe, occurs 1351; 
*Robert Beauchamp (Bello Campo), occurs 1352; &#x27;late prior&#x27; in 1392

In 1390 William of Wykeham, Bishop of Winchester, secured both papal and royal authority to acquire the lands of alien priories for his colleges, and in the following year he obtained from Richard II a licence for St. Catherine&#x27;s Abbey to sell him all its possessions in England, apart from the Priory of Blyth. These possessions comprised the manor of Harmondsworth with the advowson of the church and vicarage, the manor of Tingewick with its advowson, the advowsons of Saham Toney and St. Leonard&#x27;s, and certain yearly pensions. The Bishop sent a member of his household, Richard Altryncham, to Rouen to negotiate with the abbey and convent about this buying of the priory as an endowment for his colleges. A sale was agreed on 15 October 1391, the price being fixed at 8,400 gold francs, which were paid in 1392 through a firm of Genoese bankers. The bishop also undertook to provide for the prior Robert Beauchamp and for John le Cellier, his companion, all such things in the way of wine, food, clothing, and lodging as befitted religious of their estate for the rest of their lives. He would also furnish a chapel for the abbey. The Harmondsworth property, centered on the priory which stood to the west of Manor Farm and the tithe barn, thus became part of the endowment of his two colleges at Winchester and Oxford.

==Church==

The historic parish church of Harmondsworth is the church of St Mary, of which parts date from the 12th century. There is an opinion that Heathrow Airport is legally responsible for maintaining this church&#x27;s chancel, because the airport now owns land (formerly in Heathrow village) which in 1819 at the enclosing of the commons had been assigned in lieu of tithes used to maintain the chancel.

Some Harmondsworth clergy:
* 1437–1440† Richard Wyche 
* 1511–1515 John Edmunds
* 1594–1623† Leonard Davies 
* 1628–1650† Emanuel Hodges
* 1664–1697† John Jenney
* 1698–1714† John Bush
* 1714–1727† Thomas Fyson

† &quot;Vicar died in post&quot;

==Great Barn==
The other notable historic building in Harmondsworth is the Grade I-listed Harmondsworth Great Barn, Britain&#x27;s largest barn. On the site of an earlier great barn, it was put up between 1425 and 1427 on land bought by William of Wykeham, Bishop of Winchester, in 1391, to endow his colleges Winchester College and New College, Oxford. It is the largest extant timber-framed building in England and was described by the English poet John Betjeman as the &quot;Cathedral of Middlesex&quot;. As of January 2012 the barn is owned by English Heritage.

A similar barn, built 25 years later in 1451–53, but shorter (with eight bays as opposed to the Harmondsworth barn&#x27;s 12), is at Old Burghclere, Hampshire. This monumental barn was also built on land acquired by William of Wykeham. While the Harmondsworth barn was part of Winchester College&#x27;s endowment the Burghclere barn passed to the family of Fiennes who had married the heiress of Wykeham&#x27;s great-nephew heir. It now is part of the Highclere estate belonging to Lord Carnarvon.

==Government==
===Local government===
* 1894: Rural districts brought in. Harmondsworth civil parish, created in the 1870s was put in Staines Rural District.
* 1930: Harmondsworth civil parish was transferred to Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District.
* 1949: Harmondsworth civil parish was merged with Yiewsley and West Drayton.
* 1965: Middlesex county was abolished. Yiewsley and West Drayton was transferred to the London Borough of Hillingdon, in Greater London.
* Harmondsworth forms a minority of the Heathrow Villages ward (2008-date), which elects three councillors to Hillingdon London Borough Council and had a population of 12,199 in 2011.

===United Kingdom government===
There are two UK Border Agency immigration removal centres in Harmondsworth: Colnbrook Immigration Removal Centre and Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre.

==Cottage Hospital==
The Harlington, Harmondsworth and Cranford Cottage Hospital was established in 1884 and opened in 1885. It was halfway between Harmondsworth and Cranford on the Sipson Road, about four furlongs west of Harlington.

==Economy==

British Airways is headquartered in Waterside in Harmondsworth. The building officially opened in 1998. An office of American Airlines occupies Orient House, Waterside.

Harmondsworth has two pubs: The Crown and the Five Bells.

The village was formerly home to Penguin Books, from 1937.

==Education==
Harmondsworth Primary School is in Harmondsworth.

==Transport==
The area is served by various buses and by West Drayton railway station centred north, across the M4 motorway. The Bath Road (A4) is the predecessor to this route and passes through the village with junctions in the neighbouring villages leading to the M4 motorway.

==Demography==
The area comprises well-populated and scarcely populated areas but which have differing constitutions as to the buildings in which people live and stay: hotels, homes and the two immigration control institutions (in the east and north census output areas). Thus the population fluctuates to a greater or lesser extent, dependent on land use.

<text>The London Borough of Ealing () is a London borough in London, England. It comprises the districts of Acton, Ealing, Greenford, Hanwell, Northolt, Perivale and Southall. With a population of 367,100 inhabitants, it is the third most populous London borough.

Ealing is the third largest London borough in population and eleventh largest in area, covering part of west London and a small part of north-west London. It bridges Inner and Outer London. Its administrative centre is in Ealing Broadway. Ealing London Borough Council is the local authority.

Ealing has long been known as the &quot;Queen of the Suburbs&quot; due to its many parks and tree-lined streets; the term was coined in 1902 by borough surveyor Charles Jones. This is reflected by the tree emblem on its council logo and its coat of arms. Within the borough are two garden suburbs, Brentham Garden Suburb and Bedford Park. 330 hectares within the borough are designated as part of the Metropolitan Green Belt.

The neighbouring boroughs are (clockwise from north): Harrow, Brent, Hammersmith and Fulham, Hounslow and Hillingdon.

==History==
A local government district called Ealing was created in 1863. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. Ealing was then incorporated to become a municipal borough in 1901. The borough was significantly enlarged in 1926, when it absorbed the neighbouring urban districts of Greenford and Hanwell, and in 1928, when it absorbed the parish of Northolt.

The London Borough of Ealing was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963, covering the combined area of the former boroughs of Ealing, Acton and Southall. The area was transferred from Middlesex to Greater London to become one of the 32 London Boroughs.

==Districts==

Ealing borough is made up of seven major towns:

* Acton (W3)
* Ealing (W5, W13, NW10)
* Greenford (UB6)
* Hanwell (W7)
* Northolt (UB5)
* Perivale (UB6)
* Southall (UB1, UB2).

==Governance==

The local authority is Ealing Council, which meets at Ealing Town Hall and has its main offices in the adjoining Perceval House on Uxbridge Road in Ealing.

===Greater London representation===
Since 2000, for elections to the London Assembly, the borough forms part of the Ealing and Hillingdon constituency.

===UK Parliament===
The London Borough of Ealing is represented by three Members of Parliament (MPs), elected in the following constituencies:
*Ealing Central and Acton
*Ealing North
*Ealing Southall

==London Fire Brigade==
There are four fire stations within the London Borough of Ealing. Southall and Northolt have similar-sized station grounds and both house two pumping appliances. Southall attended some 700 incidents more than their Northolt counterparts in 2006/07. Ealing, with two pumping appliances, and Acton, one pump and two fire investigation units, are the other two appliances in the area. The ward of Northfield had over forty malicious calls made from it, more than twice as many as any other ward within Ealing.

==Education==

Ealing has a total of 91 state-run schools and nurseries. There are 13 high schools under the domain of the local education authority, 12 of which are either comprehensive, foundation or voluntary-aided, and one city academy.

A number of successful independent schools, including St Benedict&#x27;s School (co-ed), the Barbara Speake Stage School (co-ed, ages 4–16), St Augustine&#x27;s Priory (girls) and Notting Hill and Ealing High School (girls), are also located within the borough.

The Japanese School in London is a Japanese international school in Acton.

==Demographics==

The borough of Ealing is ethnically diverse. In 2011, 49% gave their ethnicity as white, 30% as Asian, 15% as Afro Caribbean and 4.5% as of mixed or multiple ethnicity, the remaining identifying as Arab or other ethnicity. The main religions of the borough&#x27;s population in 2011 were Christianity (44%), Islam (16%) Hinduism (9%) and Sikhism (8%); 15% stated they had no religion and a further 7% did not state any religion.

===Ethnicity===

===Ethnic communities===

The borough has a long-standing Irish community which is particularly visible through the number of established Irish pubs in the borough and the popularity of Gaelic games in the community. Country flags for example can be seen flown on the outside or hung inside of various pubs in the area, especially on St Patrick&#x27;s Day. St Benedict&#x27;s School has also had a long term affiliation with the Irish community in Ealing, as it is a Catholic school. Many Irish members of the Ealing borough attend Ealing Abbey which is linked to St Benedict&#x27;s School.

Ealing has a large British-Polish community that owes its origins to the World War II refugees and Polish armed forces finding both cheap accommodation and work in the Acton area, which then had a high proportion of London&#x27;s light engineering companies involved with government war contracts. This community has grown considerably including more shops with authentic Polish food since Poland joined the European Union and its migrant workers have been able to come to the UK freely; in 2011 the borough had the UK&#x27;s highest proportion of Polish speakers at 6% of the population. This has also led to an increase in Polish social centres in the borough. The population is highly concentrated in Acton, Greenford and Perivale.

Southall in the west of the borough is home to one of the largest South Asian communities in the UK, the majority of whom are Sikhs. The community first developed in the 1950s. The Asian population makes up 80% of Southall Broadway ward as of 2011, a contrast compared to the 8% of Southfield ward in the borough&#x27;s east.

The most noticeable Afro-Caribbean populations in the borough are in the areas of Northolt and Acton. Of the residents in the Northolt West End ward (as of 2011), 19.4% of them were of Afro-Caribbean heritage, with a relatively large proportion of these being Somali. 16.1% of the South Acton ward was black, whilst 15.9% of the East Acton ward was black. The Caribbean population of Ealing Borough is also mostly concentrated in these two wards of Acton.

In a speech to mark the 70th anniversary of the Indian Journalists&#x27; Association and of Indian independence on 15 August 1947 North Ealing MP Stephen Pound said: &quot;There is North Ealing, South Ealing and Darjeeling&quot; referring to the relatively large Asian population.

There are also churches and centres for London&#x27;s Hungarian and Assyrian communities in South Ealing.

===Other demographics===
As of the 2011 census, Hanger Hill had, at 13%, the largest proportion of people aged 65 and over. The lowest were East Acton and Southall Green, at 8% each.

==Sport and leisure==

Ealing is home to Ealing Studios, and was a major centre of the UK film industry. Brentford F.C. draw a large amount of local support from the borough, although Griffin Park is situated just outside the borough, in the neighbouring London Borough of Hounslow.

The borough is represented in Rugby Union by Ealing Trailfinders, Wasps RFC, Hanwell RFC, Old Priorian, Northolt and West London RFC.

The borough has four non-League football clubs Hanwell Town F.C. and Southall F.C. which both play at Reynolds Field in Perivale. The other two clubs are London Tigers F.C., which plays at the Avenue Park Stadium in Greenford and North Greenford United F.C., which plays at Berkeley Fields.

The borough is also home to one of the country&#x27;s top athletics clubs, with Ealing Southall and Middlesex AC based at Perivale Athletics Track.
The club has a successful history, with many national and international honours, including the double Olympic gold medallist, Kelly Holmes.
In 2020 the club celebrated their 100th anniversary.

==Transport==

===Rail and London Underground===
The numerous National Rail and London Underground stations in the borough are:

===Travel to work===
In March 2011, the main forms of transport that residents used to travel to work were: driving a car or van, 21.8% of all residents aged 16–74; underground, metro, light rail, tram, 18.0%; bus, minibus or coach, 9.2%; on foot, 4.7%; train, 4.0%; work mainly at or from home, 3.0%; bicycle, 2.0%.

===Transport development===

<text>Harold Wood is a suburban neighbourhood in East London  in the London Borough of Havering. It is situated east-northeast of Charing Cross. Harold Wood was part of the ancient parish of Hornchurch, which became the Liberty of Havering. Most of the current area of Harold Wood became part of Hornchurch Urban District in 1926. It is near to the Greater London boundary with Essex.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name Harold Wood was recorded in about 1237, when it was shown as &quot;Horalds Wood&quot;. It was named after King Harold Godwinson, who was defeated by William the Conqueror in 1066. He held the surrounding manor of Havering-atte-Bower. Some of the original roads are named after Anglo-Saxon kings such as Æthelstan and Alfred the Great.

===Local government===
Harold Wood formed a ward in the ancient parish of Hornchurch, although the area now around the station was in the North End ward. The eastern and southern boundary of the parish was the River Ingrebourne such that the area around Harold Court was in the parish of Upminster. Although locally situated within Essex the ancient Hornchurch parish formed the independent Liberty of Havering and was outside county administration. Harold Wood ward came under the control of the vestry of Romford chapelry, which also included Collier Row and Noak Hill, however most of the current area of Harold Wood was in the North End ward which remained under Hornchurch parish vestry. In 1836 Romford and Hornchurch became separate civil parishes and were grouped into the Romford Poor Law Union. The area of the union, excluding the town of Romford, became a rural sanitary district in 1875. The special status of the Liberty of Havering was abolished in 1892 and the area was reincorporated into Essex.

Following the Local Government Act 1894, the Romford parish was split with the northern part of the Harold Wood ward becoming a new parish of Noak Hill and the southern part forming part of the Romford Rural parish, both within the Romford Rural District. This split the administration of the area between the Hornchurch, Romford Rural, Noak Hill and Upminster parish councils, and the Romford Rural District Council. In 1900 the Romford Rural parish was recombined with Romford Urban (which consisted of the town of Romford) to form an expanded Romford Urban District. With suburban house building, the population in the area started to rise soon after which prompted changes to the local government system. Hornchurch parish became the Hornchurch Urban District in 1926 and Upminster was added to it in 1934. The area formed part of the London Traffic Area from 1924 and the London Passenger Transport Area from 1933. The whole area was included in the London Borough of Havering in 1965 when it was transferred from Essex to Greater London.

===Urban development===

Harold Wood Hospital, on Gubbins Lane, closed on 13 December 2006 with all patients moved to Queen&#x27;s Hospital in nearby Romford. The site vacated by the hospital was earmarked for a 470-home housing development which faced fierce opposition from the local population. As of February 2023, the Kings Park estate has been completed.

==Education==
There are three schools in Harold Wood:
* Secondary - Redden Court School
* Primary - Harold Wood Primary School and Harold Court Primary School

==Geography==

Harold Wood borders with the following places:

* Ardleigh Green
* Gidea Park
* Harold Park
* Harold Hill
* Hornchurch
* Brentwood

==Demography==
86% of the population is White British, as of the 2011 census.

==Transport==

===Buses===
Harold Wood is served by several London Buses routes:

* Daily routes include 256, 294, 346, 496, 498 and 499
* Mon–Sat 347
* School routes 646, 656 and 608

===Railway===
Harold Wood railway station is situated on the Great Eastern Main Line. It is served by Elizabeth line trains running between Shenfield and Paddington via Whitechapel, Liverpool Street, Farringdon and Tottenham Court Road. The nearest tube stations to Harold Wood are Upminster Bridge and Hornchurch, both on the District line.

===Roads===
The M25 motorway runs along the easterly boundary and the A12 and A127 roads form the north-west and south-west borders respectively.

<doc id="94077" wikidata="Q1359941" url="?curid=94077" title="Hỏa Lò Prison">
<text>Hỏa Lò Prison (, Nhà tù Hỏa Lò; ) was a prison in Hanoi originally used by the French colonists in Indochina for political prisoners, and later by North Vietnam for U.S. prisoners of war during the Vietnam War. During this later period, it was known to American POWs as the &quot;Hanoi Hilton&quot;. Following Operation Homecoming, the prison was used to incarcerate Vietnamese dissidents and other political prisoners, including the poet Nguyễn Chí Thiện. The prison was demolished during the 1990s, although its gatehouse remains a museum.

==French era==
The name Hỏa Lò, commonly translated as &quot;fiery furnace&quot; or even &quot;Hell&#x27;s hole&quot;, also means &quot;stove&quot;. The name originated from the street name phố Hỏa Lò, due to the concentration of stores selling wood stoves and coal-fire stoves along the street in pre-colonial times.

The prison was built in Hanoi by the French, in dates ranging from 1886 to 1889 to 1898 to 1901, when Vietnam was still part of French Indochina. The French called the prison &quot;Maison Centrale&quot;, &#x27;Central House&#x27;, which is still the designation of prisons for dangerous or long sentence detainees in France. It was located near Hanoi&#x27;s French Quarter. It was intended to hold Vietnamese prisoners, particularly political prisoners agitating for independence who were often subject to torture and execution. A 1913 renovation expanded its capacity from 460 inmates to 600. It was nevertheless often overcrowded, holding some 730 prisoners on a given day in 1916, a figure which rose to 895 in 1922 and 1,430 in 1933. By 1954 it held more than 2000 people; with its inmates held in subhuman conditions, it had become a symbol of colonialist exploitation and of the bitterness of the Vietnamese towards the French.

The central urban location of the prison also became part of its early character. During the 1910s through 1930s, street peddlers made an occupation of passing outside messages in through the jail&#x27;s windows and tossing tobacco and opium over the walls; letters and packets would be thrown out to the street in the opposite direction. Within the prison itself, communication and ideas passed. Many of the future leading figures in Communist North Vietnam and Viet Minh spent time in Maison Centrale during the 1930s and 1940s.

Conditions for political prisoners in the &quot;Colonial Bastille&quot; were publicised in 1929 in a widely circulated account by the Trotskyist Phan Van Hum of the experience he shared with the charismatic publicist Nguyen An Ninh.

==Democratic Republic of Vietnam, 1954==
Following the defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu and the 1954 Geneva Accords the French left Hanoi and the prison came under the authority of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Thereafter the prison served as an education center for revolutionary doctrine and activity, and it was kept around after the French left to mark its historical significance to the North Vietnamese.

==Vietnam War==
During the Vietnam War, the first U.S. prisoner of war to be sent to Hỏa Lò was Lieutenant Junior Grade Everett Alvarez Jr., who was shot down on August 5, 1964. From the beginning, U.S. POWs endured miserable conditions, including poor food and unsanitary conditions. The prison complex was sarcastically nicknamed the &quot;Hanoi Hilton&quot; by the American POWs, in reference to the well-known Hilton Hotel chain. There is some disagreement among the first group of POWs who coined the name but F-8D pilot Bob Shumaker was the first to write it down, carving &quot;Welcome to the Hanoi Hilton&quot; on the handle of a pail to greet the arrival of Air Force Lieutenant Robert Peel.

Beginning in early 1967, a new area of the prison was opened for incoming American POWs; it was dubbed &quot;Little Vegas&quot;, and its individual buildings and areas were named after Las Vegas Strip landmarks, such as &quot;Golden Nugget&quot;, &quot;Thunderbird&quot;, &quot;Stardust&quot;, &quot;Riviera&quot;, and the &quot;Desert Inn&quot;. These names were chosen because many pilots had trained at Nellis Air Force Base, located in proximity to Las Vegas. American pilots were frequently already in poor condition by the time they were captured, injured either during their ejection or in landing on the ground.

The Hỏa Lò was one site used by the North Vietnamese Army to house, torture, and interrogate captured servicemen, mostly American pilots shot down during bombing raids. Although North Vietnam was a signatory of the Third Geneva Convention of 1949, which demanded &quot;decent and humane treatment&quot; of prisoners of war, severe torture methods were employed, such as rope bindings, irons, beatings, and prolonged solitary confinement. When prisoners of war began to be released from this and other North Vietnamese prisons during the Johnson administration, their testimonies revealed widespread and systematic abuse of prisoners of war.
In 1968, and from East Germany filmed in the prison the 4-chapter series &quot;Pilots in Pajamas&quot; with interviews with American pilots in the prison, that they claimed were unscripted.
Heynowski and Scheumann asked them about the contradictions in their self image and their war behavior and between the Code of the United States Fighting Force and their behavior during and after capture.

Regarding treatment at Hỏa Lò and other prisons, the North Vietnamese countered by stating that prisoners were treated well and in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. During 1969, they broadcast a series of statements from American prisoners that purported to support this notion. The North Vietnamese also maintained that their prisons were no worse than prisons for POWs and political prisoners in South Vietnam, such as the one on Côn Sơn Island. Mistreatment of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese prisoners and South Vietnamese dissidents in South Vietnam&#x27;s prisons was indeed frequent, as was North Vietnamese abuse of South Vietnamese prisoners and their own dissidents.

Beginning in late 1969, treatment of the prisoners at Hỏa Lò and other camps became less severe and generally more tolerable. Following the late 1970 attempted rescue operation at Sơn Tây prison camp, most of the POWs at the outlying camps were moved to Hỏa Lò, so that the North Vietnamese had fewer camps to protect. This created the &quot;Camp Unity&quot; communal living area at Hỏa Lò, which greatly reduced the isolation of the POWs and improved their morale.

===Post-war accounts===
After the implementation of the 1973 Paris Peace Accords, neither the United States nor its allies ever formally charged North Vietnam with the war crimes revealed to have been committed there. In the 2000s, the Vietnamese government has had the position that claims that prisoners of war were tortured at Hỏa Lò and other sites during the war are fabricated, but that Vietnam wants to move past the issue as part of establishing better relations with the U.S. Tran Trong Duyet, a jailer at Hỏa Lò beginning in 1968 and its commandant for the last three years of the war, maintained in 2008 that no prisoners of war were tortured. However, eyewitness accounts by American servicemen present a different account of their captivity.

After the war, Risner wrote the book &quot;Passing of the Night&quot; detailing his seven years at Hỏa Lò. A considerable amount of literature emerged from released POWs after repatriation, depicting Hỏa Lò and the other prisons as places where such atrocities as murder, beatings, broken bones, teeth and eardrums, dislocated limbs, starvation, serving of food contaminated with human and animal feces, and medical neglect of infections and tropical disease occurred. These details are revealed in famous accounts by McCain (&quot;Faith of My Fathers&quot;), Denton, Alvarez, Day, Risner, Stockdale and dozens of others.

In addition, Hỏa Lò was depicted in the 1987 Hollywood movie &quot;The Hanoi Hilton&quot;.

==Hỏa Lò in the late 1970s and early 1980s==
The prison continued to be in use after the release of the American prisoners. Among the last inmates was dissident poet Nguyễn Chí Thiện, who was reimprisoned in 1979 after attempting to deliver his poems to the British Embassy, and spent the next six years in Hỏa Lò until 1985 when he was transferred to a more modern prison. He mentions the last years of the prison, partly in fictional form, in &quot;Hỏa Lò/Hanoi Hilton Stories&quot; (2007).

==Demolition, conversion and museum==

Most of the prison was demolished in the mid-1990s and the site now contains two high-rise buildings, one of them the 25-story Somerset Grand Hanoi serviced apartment building. Other parts have been converted into a commercial complex retaining the original French colonial walls.

Only part of the prison exists today as a museum. The displays mainly show the prison during the French colonial period, including the guillotine room, still with original equipment, and the quarters for male and female Vietnamese political prisoners.

Building materials from several complete cells were saved, including original bricks, cement ceilings, concrete &quot;beds&quot; with ankle shackles, and an original cell door and transom window. After being in storage in Vietnam for six years and nearly another ten in Canada, the cells were reconstructed using the original materials and turned into a permanent exhibit that opened in 2023 at the American Heritage Museum in Stow, Massachusetts.

<text>This article is about the spiritual beliefs, histories and practices in Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw mythology. The Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw are a group of Indigenous nations, numbering about 5,500, who live in the central coast of British Columbia on northern Vancouver Island and the mainland. &quot;Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw&quot; translates into &quot;Kwak&#x27;wala-speaking tribes.&quot; However, the individual tribes are single autonomous nations and do not view themselves collectively as one group.

These people share many common cultural customs with neighboring nations. They share beliefs in many of the same spirits and deities, although they speak different languages. Some spirits are, however, totally unique to one or two cultures and are not universally known throughout the Northwest Coast. Each tribe has its own history, practices, and stories. Some origin stories belong to only one specific tribe, while another tribe has its own stories. But many practices, rituals, and ceremonies occur throughout Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw culture, and in some cases, neighboring indigenous cultures also.

== Creation stories ==
The Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw creation narrative states the world was created by a raven flying over water, who, finding nowhere to land, decided to create islands by dropping small pebbles into the water. He then created trees and grass, and, after several failed attempts, he made the first man and woman out of wood and clay.

=== Flood ===
:&quot;Main page: Deluge (mythology)&quot;
Like all Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, most of the Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw tribes have stories about their people surviving the flood. With some of these nations, their history talks of their ancestors transforming into their natural form and disappearing while the waters rose then subsided. For others, they have stories of their people attaching their oceangoing canoes to tall peaking mountains. For the stories about supernatural powers, these figures tend to be the founding clans of some Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw nations.

== Ancestors, crest, and clans ==
Tseiqami is a man who comes from the cedar tree and Thunderbird, lord of the winter dance season, a massive supernatural bird whose wing beats cause the thunder, and the flash of whose eyes causes lightning. Tseiqami hunts whales for its dinner out at sea, and sometimes helped heroic ancestors build houses by placing giant cedar beams for them. Thunderbird has a younger brother named Kolus.

Thunderbird&#x27;s adversary is Qaniqilak, spirit of the summer season, who is often identified as the sea god, Kumugwe. Kumugwe or Komokwa is the name of &quot;Undersea Chief.&quot; Many Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw families have been blessed by riches and supernatural treasures bestowed by this god of the tides and maker of coppers. 

Sisiutl is a giant three-headed sea serpent whose glance can turn an adversary into stone. Cross beams of clan houses sometimes are carved with his appearance. Blessed ancestors have sometimes received sisiutl&#x27;s help when he transforms himself into an invincible war canoe, and sometimes into a magic belt with which to gird oneself against all dangers.

Dzunukwa (Tsonokwa) is a type of cannibal giant (called sasquatch by other Northwest Coast tribes) and comes in both male and female forms. In most legends, the female form is the most commonly told; she eats children and cries &quot;hu-hu!&quot; to attract them, she imitates the child&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s voice. Children frequently outwit her, sometimes killing her and taking her treasures without being eaten.

Bakwas is king of the ghosts. He is a small green spirit whose face looks emaciated like a skeleton, but has a long curving nose. He haunts the forests and tries to bring the living over to the world of the dead. In some myths Bakwas is the husband of Dzunukwa.

U&#x27;melth is the Raven, who brought the Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw people the moon, fire, salmon, the sun and the tides.

&quot;Pugwis&quot; is a sort of aquatic creature with a fish-like face and large incisors.

== Ceremony ==
Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw spirituality is transmitted at ceremonies, mostly during the winter season. These ceremonies are often referred to as potlatches. They are mostly designed for the transference, justification, and reaffirmation of family and spiritual status inherited from primeval ancestors who contacted the spirit world and were given privileges from beings of a supernatural nature. These beings prefer honor, power, and magic through the gift of Tlugwe, which are supernatural treasures, often taking the physical form of masks and regalia, but also comprising stories, songs, recitations, dances, and other intangible performances.

Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw spirits, like those of other Northwest Coast peoples, can be divided into four separate spirit realms: sky spirits, sea spirits, earth spirits, and otherworldly spirits. All four realms interact with one another, and human beings attempt to contact all four worlds and often channel their spirits at sacred ceremonies wherein dancers go into trances while wearing masks and other regalia associated with the spiritworld.

Of particular importance in Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw culture is the secret society called Hamatsa. During the winter, there is a four-day complex dance that serves to initiate new members of Hamatsa. The Hamatsa dancer represents the spirit of Baxbaxwalanuksiwe (&quot;Man-Eater at the North End of the World&quot;); who can transform into various man-eating birds and has mouths all over his body. Hamatsa initiates are possessed by Baxwbakwalanuksiwe&#x27;. On the first day of the Hamatsa ceremonies the initiate is lured out of the woods and brought into the Big House to be tamed. When the initiate returns, he enacts his cannibalistic possession symbolically. Gwaxwgwakwalanuksiwe&#x27; is the most prestigious role in the Supernatural Man-Eater Birds ceremony; he is a man-eating raven. Galuxwadzuwus (&quot;Crooked-Beak of Heaven&quot;) and Huxhukw (supernatural Crane-Like Bird who cracks skulls of men to suck out their brains) are other participants.

<doc id="94087" wikidata="Q1050827" url="?curid=94087" title="Waluigi">
<text>is a character in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise. He plays the role of Luigi&#x27;s arch-rival and accompanies Wario in spin-offs from the main &quot;Mario&quot; series, often for the sake of causing mischief. He was created by Camelot employee Fumihide Aoki and was voiced from 2000 to 2022 by Charles Martinet, who described Waluigi as someone with a lot of self-pity. Waluigi&#x27;s design is characterised by his tall stature, thin and lanky frame, and his purple and black outfit with purple hat, which displays an inverted yellow &quot;L&quot;.

He was designed as Wario&#x27;s tennis partner and sidekick, debuting in the 2000 Nintendo 64 game &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;. He has featured in over 50 video games, appearing in at least one game every year since his debut until 2022. He is a playable character in &quot;Mario&quot; sports games, most &quot;Mario Party&quot; games and also in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series. He has also made appearances in other video games, such as the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.

Since his debut, he has received a polarized reception from the media, often being accused of having few defining characteristics and minimal backstory. Waluigi has attained a cult following, especially helped through his use as an Internet meme. Although he has never appeared in his own video game or any mainline &quot;Mario&quot; game, critics have described him as one of Nintendo&#x27;s mascots and a cult hero.

== Concept and creation ==

Waluigi was created during the development of the game &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; to serve as the bitter rival to Luigi. He was originally introduced as Wario&#x27;s younger brother in the American version of the game. His character design was created by Fumihide Aoki. His name is a portmanteau of Luigi&#x27;s name and the Japanese adjective meaning &quot;bad&quot;; hence, a &quot;bad Luigi&quot;.

Waluigi was conceived as a sidekick for Wario to team up with in the doubles matches of &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Nintendo Dream&quot;, Shugo Takahashi said that he initially asked Nintendo to create a new character but was given instruction to develop a character at Camelot. The character&#x27;s name was agreed from the beginning before his design was finalised. Initially the idea was to change one letter to make him similar to Wario, but Takahashi said that as a bad version of Luigi, he was named Waluigi. An early idea for the symbol on Waluigi&#x27;s hat was a W, but as this was the same as Wario, it was changed to the letters W and L. Yōichi Kotabe, who supervised the character at Nintendo, decided that this should be an upside down L as an inversion of Luigi, just as the letter W in Wario is an upside down letter M for Mario. Waluigi&#x27;s appearance was designed to be lean to create a balanced team combination with the stoutness of Wario. Camelot took inspiration from Boyacky and Tonzura from the Doronbo Gang in the &quot;Yatterman&quot; series. His purple colouring was chosen to create a balance of colours alongside those of the other characters in the game and his moustache created in the shape of the letter L. Takahashi said that Waluigi was characterised as the rival of Luigi, with them having a similar relationship to Mario and Wario.

Upon his debut in &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;, Waluigi was voiced by Charles Martinet, who continued to voice the character until stepping back from recording character voices in 2023 to take on a new role as Mario Ambassador at Nintendo.

Waluigi&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Super Mario Strikers&quot; gained attention for a celebratory taunt that became known as the &quot;Crotch chop&quot;. The taunt involves the character thrusting his hips forward while gesturing towards his crotch. Despite looking like the letter V, Waluigi&#x27;s chop using both hands was supposed to represent the W in his name. The game&#x27;s director, Mike Inglehart, said that the development team at Next Level Games wanted to make Waluigi &quot;a bit edgier than Wario&quot; and explore his character. He thought that Waluigi&#x27;s character was about blaming others, whereas Wario was about self-loathing. Inglehart said that when it was presented to Nintendo &quot;nobody batted an eye&quot; so he was surprised that the taunt was allowed to remain in the game without question.

== Characteristics ==

Waluigi is portrayed as a mischievous villain and an exaggerated mirror version of Luigi. He bears a large pink nose and crooked moustache. His stature is tall and his frame thin and lanky. He is the rival of Luigi and is the same age. His &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; trophy describes him as hardworking by stating that he spends his time training and perfecting his skills in order to antagonise the Mario brothers. Although he has a scrawny physique, Waluigi is technically skilled and athletic, but sometimes cheats in-game. His design comprises black overalls, a purple long-sleeved shirt, a purple hat with a yellow &quot;Γ&quot; symbol (an inverted L, paralleling Wario&#x27;s W as an upside-down M).

Martinet stated that the cornerstone of Waluigi&#x27;s personality is one of self-pity, a character who feels that everything goes right for everyone but himself. Waluigi was created to be the tennis partner of Wario in &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; and early material from Nintendo of Europe portrayed them as brothers, but their relationship has since been ambiguous. When asked whether Waluigi was a brother to Wario in 2008, Martinet stated that while he did not know, he felt that they were just &quot;two nice, evil guys who found each other&quot;. 

Despite having appeared in more than 50 video games, Waluigi has been provided with little backstory and has few defining traits other than the need to be liked, an appreciation of Princess Daisy, and his habit of screaming out his signature catchphrase, &quot;Waaah!&quot; In various &quot;Mario&quot; sports games Waluigi can perform exaggerated athletic moves. In &quot;Mario Power Tennis&quot; when making an offensive power shot, he demonstrates his spinning ability and poses in the shape of his &quot;Γ&quot; symbol. In &quot;Mario Party 8&quot;, his preferred victory stance involves producing a rose as a recurring accessory. As displayed in &quot;Mario Power Tennis&quot; and &quot;Mario Hoops 3-on-3&quot;, Waluigi has the ability to summon a body of water and swim towards the ball, which &quot;IGN&quot; editor Rob Burman described as &quot;baffling&quot;.

==Appearances==
=== &quot;Mario&quot; spin-off games ===
From his debut in 2000, Waluigi appeared in at least one game every year until 2022. This 22-year streak ended in 2023, which was the first year that Waluigi did not appear in any game. He is the only regular character in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise to never appear in his own game or be given a role in the mainline &quot;Mario&quot; series. His first appearance was in the Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color versions of &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;, establishing himself as Wario&#x27;s doubles partner. He remained partners with Wario for future installments, the one exception being &quot;Mario Tennis: Power Tour&quot;, where he appeared in-game without Wario. &quot;Mario Power Tennis&quot; begins with Wario and Waluigi losing a tennis tournament and plotting their revenge on Mario and Luigi by teaming up with Bowser, who helps them to train up for the doubles final. In &quot;Mario Tennis Aces&quot;, Waluigi is a defensive character that can cover a wide area. He and Wario initiate the story events by offering Mario a racket called Lucien that possesses Luigi and threatens to destroy the kingdom. During gameplay he can perform a trick shot in which he moonwalks. He also performs a special shot that involves spinning around flaunting a rose.

Alongside Princess Daisy, Waluigi joined the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series starting with &quot;Mario Party 3&quot;. The game features his own board filled with traps named Waluigi&#x27;s Island. After &quot;Mario Party 3&quot;, he returned as a playable character in every subsequent game in the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series except &quot;Mario Party Advance&quot;. He next appeared as one of the playable characters in &quot;Mario Party 4&quot;. In &quot;Mario Party-e&quot;, one of the multiplayer duels is named Waluigi&#x27;s Reign.

In the &quot;Mario Golf&quot; series, Waluigi features as a playable character alongside other main &quot;Mario&quot; characters in &quot;Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour&quot;, where he has his own unique play style. Waluigi and Wario are presented as the villains in the game&#x27;s introduction until they get into trouble by angering Bowser. In 2014, he returned as a playable character in &quot;Mario Golf: World Tour&quot;. In the 2021 golf game &quot;Mario Golf: Super Rush&quot;, his Special Shot is his Slim Stinger, which blasts balls out of its path. He also performs a Dance-off Dash, in which he pirouettes and leaps.

Waluigi appears in the &quot;Mario Strikers&quot; series beginning with &quot;Super Mario Strikers&quot;. He is one of nine &quot;Mario&quot; characters that can be chosen as team captains. He returns in &quot;Mario Strikers Charged&quot; and is introduced in the game&#x27;s introduction where Mario, Bowser and other major characters battle for the ball on a soccer field. He appears as a playable character in &quot;Mario Strikers: Battle League&quot;, where he is a defensive character and can perform a powerful kick that sends the ball towards the goal leaving a trail of thorns.

Waluigi is a playable driver in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series, first appearing in &quot;Mario Kart: Double Dash!!&quot;, where his course is known as &quot;Waluigi Stadium&quot;. He features in all subsequent console installments with the exception of &quot;Mario Kart 7&quot;. In &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot;, Waluigi has his own course named &quot;Waluigi Pinball&quot;, which later returned as a DLC booster course in &quot;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&quot;. He is a recurring character in &quot;Mario Kart Tour&quot;, where he also appears as a bus driver. In October 2021 for a Halloween event &quot;Mario Kart Tour&quot; introduced another variant of Waluigi dressed as a vampire wearing a top hat and cape and riding a Vampire Flyer kart.

Waluigi appears in &quot;Mario Superstar Baseball&quot; (2005) as one of the cast of characters featuring Mario and friends. He reprises his role as a playable character in &quot;Mario Super Sluggers&quot;. Waluigi plays a significant role as the main antagonist of &quot;Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix&quot;, in which he wreaks havoc in the Mushroom Kingdom by stealing the Music Keys to hypnotize the world with his dancing, requiring Mario and Luigi to retrieve them. He also appears as one of the player characters shooting hoops alongside Mario in &quot;Mario Hoops 3-on-3&quot; (titled &quot;Mario Slam Basketball&quot; in Europe), where he performs a swimming ability. Waluigi is one of several playable characters appearing in the &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic&quot; series, starting with the crossover sports game &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games&quot;, which features Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog. He appears alongside other &quot;Mario&quot; characters in &quot;Mario Sports Mix&quot;, a sports game featuring hockey, volleyball, dodgeball and basketball. He and other &quot;Mario&quot; characters appear in &quot;Mario Sports Superstars&quot;. A variant of Waluigi named Dr. Waluigi appeared as one of 45 doctor characters in the mobile game &quot;Dr. Mario World&quot; before the game was shut down.

=== Other video games ===
In the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, starting with &quot;Brawl&quot;, Waluigi appears as a non-playable Assist Trophy item. When Waluigi was revealed as an Assist Trophy but not a playable character for &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot;, game director Masahiro Sakurai jokingly stated that &quot;just because you try hard doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ll make it into the battle&quot;. He was again excluded as a playable character but instead used as an example for destroying Assist Trophies during the gameplay reveal of &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;.

Waluigi makes minor appearances in other video games. In &quot;Game &amp; Watch Gallery 4&quot;, he is an opponent of Luigi in the &quot;Boxing&quot; game. He appears in &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot; as an unlockable Mystery Mushroom costume for Mario to wear in the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; style. Although he does not make an appearance in &quot;Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&quot;, Mario can be dressed in the colors of Waluigi. In 2016, he was introduced alongside other core &quot;Mario&quot; characters to the &quot;&quot; as a skin in the Super Mario Mash-Up Pack. In &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot;, an outfit modeled after Waluigi&#x27;s own can be purchased in-game and worn by Mario after the player has collected enough Power Moons. A Rabbid version of Waluigi named Bwaluigi appears as a boss alongside Wario&#x27;s Rabbid counterpart Bwario in &quot;Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle&quot;.

== Merchandise ==
Waluigi has appeared in official branded merchandise, such as plush dolls, clothing and food packaging. His purple colour scheme and design has been used on official Nintendo Switch controllers. In April 2016, Nintendo released an amiibo of Waluigi as part of a set of seven &quot;Super Mario&quot; amiibo figures.

==Reception==
Since his appearance in &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;, Waluigi has received a mixed reception. Ben Bertoli of &quot;Kotaku&quot; said that the game introduced &quot;one of gaming&#x27;s greatest anti-heroes&quot; and that Waluigi had since gained a cult following. &quot;IGN&quot; editor Matt Casamassina described him as a recognizable mascot to many, but also as a beloved one to Nintendo fans. Hiroyuki Takahashi, a developer for &quot;Mario Power Tennis&quot; chose him and Wario as his favorite characters in &quot;Power Tennis&quot;, adding that he prefers characters with more personality. Ian Walker of &quot;Kotaku&quot; expressed a pure love for Waluigi on the character&#x27;s 20th anniversary and highlighted that while Mario, Luigi and Wario are all sympathetic characters, &quot;Waluigi stands apart as the one truly irredeemable scoundrel&quot; and considered that an aspect of his character is present in everyone. Ryan Craddock of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; also celebrated the 20-year anniversary of his debut, stating that they could not imagine a Nintendo sports game without him. Writing for &quot;Game Informer&quot;, Dan Ryckert felt that Waluigi should be the star of his own game because he considered him to be funnier than Wario and highlighted that his legs look hilarious when running. Despite this, he opined that Nintendo did not care about the character because his relationship to Wario had never been clarified. While describing Waluigi as a &quot;hollow absence of a character&quot; and &quot;a rejected Frankenstein monster, cobbled together from half-assed, bad, or otherwise meaningless ideas&quot;, Dom Nero of &quot;Esquire&quot; praised the character for his tennis skills and the fluidity of his movements. He opined that playing as Waluigi in &quot;Mario Tennis Aces&quot; epitomises the joy of playing video games and highlighted his moonwalking backswing, spins and tossing of roses as &quot;devilishly entertaining&quot;. &quot;VG247&quot; writer Kelsey Raynor thought that the Waluigi Pinball track was the best in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series, stating that it was &quot;Waluigi&#x27;s time to shine&quot; and was the perfect opportunity for a character associated with chaos to force drivers into a &quot;sadistic death-trap of a race&quot;.

Pedro Hernandez writing for &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; commented that Waluigi is a &quot;very structurally basic character&quot;, simply Wario transformed into Luigi with a purple colour scheme. He said that while Wario was given a personality and story, Waluigi was just an accessory to Wario whose purpose was to pad out the supporting characters. He also noted that gamers had developed a love/hate relationship with the character, as he had generated universal hatred while also gaining a cult following. Chris Buffa of &quot;GameDaily&quot; included him as one of the characters they wanted to kill, describing him as &quot;one of the most unimportant characters in video game history&quot;. Brett Elston of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; described Waluigi as a &quot;lame-o villain&quot; in an otherwise great game, referencing &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;. Matthew Gault of &quot;Vice&quot; criticised Waluigi for having no defining characteristics other than hating Luigi and described him as a &quot;corporate trash character that&#x27;s lazy, dumb, and uninteresting&quot;. He noted that due to his lack of characterisation, fans had spent years creating their own backstories for him. &quot;Destructoid&quot; wrote that Waluigi&#x27;s name and design amounted to &quot;creative bankruptcy&quot; and thought that the Internet had created him as a meme that was outside of the character that Nintendo depicted and then mistakenly treated it as canon. In &quot;Icons of Horror and the Supernatural: An Encyclopedia of Our Worst Nightmares, Volume 1&quot;, S. T. Joshi cites Waluigi and Wario as archetypal examples of alter egos.
His exclusion as a playable character in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; (confirmed when the character was announced as a non-playable Assist Trophy during E3 2018) was met with negative reception from the gaming press and social media, including a comedic Twitter post by Netflix. The response resulted in numerous Internet memes and a Change.org petition calling for the character to be added to the game. &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Joe Skrebels described his non-playable status within the game as &quot;a slap in the face for those who want a playable Waluigi&quot;. Fan reaction to the omission intensified and resulted in series director Masahiro Sakurai being subjected to a harassment campaign on social media. Former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé acknowledged the popularity of Waluigi and dismissed the idea that Nintendo had purposefully excluded him due to disliking the character. Claire McNear of &quot;The Ringer&quot; described Waluigi as Nintendo&#x27;s cult hero, but commented that his place in the &quot;Mario&quot; hierarchy of characters is tenuous and that, despite being a &quot;pan-internet obsession&quot;, he is yet to appear in a mainline &quot;Mario&quot; game outside of spinoffs. Ian Walker of &quot;Kotaku&quot; highlighted that official artwork of the character promoting a blue-purple Switch had gained considerable Internet attention due to his seductive pose and use of a rose as a romantic gesture. Briana Lawrence of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; described Waluigi as &quot;Nintendo&#x27;s ultimate sex symbol&quot; in reference to his official render and found him to be interesting due to the mysterious nature of his character. This positive reaction to Waluigi&#x27;s animations was echoed by Zack Zwiezen for &quot;Kotaku&quot;, who upon reviewing a demo for &quot;Mario Strikers: Battle League&quot; noted that Waluigi&#x27;s characteristic swagger and &quot;rose pose&quot; featured prominently in his scoring animation. Henry Stockdale writing for &quot;TechRadar&quot; praised the game&#x27;s visuals, particularly describing Waluigi&#x27;s Hyper Strike involving placing a rose in his mouth as &quot;the stuff of many Nintendo fans&#x27; dreams&quot;. Zack Zwiezen also expressed disappointment over Waluigi not appearing in a single game in 2023 and thought the character had been forgotten by Nintendo and deserved his own game, particularly because Princess Peach appears in her own game.

=== Legacy ===
Due to his popularity, Waluigi has been featured in popular culture in the form of memes, songs and poems. Elijah Watson of &quot;The Daily Dot&quot; chronicled his influence as an internet meme from 2008, describing him as &quot;beloved by a part of the web&quot;. In April 2009, he appeared in the webcomic &quot;Brawl in the Family&quot;, which was renamed &quot;Waluigi in the Family&quot; for April Fools&#x27; Day. He became a recurring character, resulting in the webcomic introducing the catchphrase &quot;Too bad. Waluigi time.&quot; In May 2021, in an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, host Elon Musk starred as Wario in a sketch in which he was put on trial for murdering Mario in a kart race, while Kate McKinnon dressed as Waluigi. A phenomenon in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) known as the &quot;Waluigi effect&quot; was inspired by the character in reference to Carl Jung&#x27;s concept of the dark, repressed side of the human personality, which is based on the theory that AI has the potential to produce chaotic or harmful results.

<doc id="94089" wikidata="Q898660" url="?curid=94089" title="Heathrow (hamlet)">
<text>Heathrow or Heath Row was a wayside hamlet along a minor country lane called Heathrow Road in the ancient parish of Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England, on the outskirts of what is now Greater London. Its buildings and all associated holdings were demolished, along with almost all of the often grouped locality of The Magpies in 1944 for the construction of the new London Airport, which would later assume the name of Heathrow after 1967.

The name Heathrow described its layout: a lane, on one side smallholdings and farms of fields and orchards which ran for a little over a , on the other, until the 1819 Inclosure for farmland, common land: a mixture of pasture, hunting and foraging land on less fertile heath. Akin to Sipson Green it was a scattered agricultural locality of Harmondsworth. The two lightly populated places dotted the brickearth-over-gravel soils in the east of Harmondsworth which historically butted on to Hounslow Heath. Yards from the lane, while the heath existed, General William Roy mapped one end of the first baseline for measuring the distance between the Paris and Greenwich observatories, the first precise distance survey in Britain, in 1784.

By the late 19th century Heathrow had developed three main agricultural settlement clusters with orchards and fields worked by teams of labourers – Heathrow Hall, Perrotts Farm and on some measures Perry Oaks at a fork in the southwest end of the lane. Abutting The Magpies, east along the Bath Road, Sipson Green also lay in Harmondsworth, covered in the article on the hamlet-turned-village of Sipson. A small orchard founded before the 19th century Kings Arbour, Harmondsworth, separated The Magpies from Heathrow. The Magpies had a mission church of the parish and has kept one of its pre-1765 public houses, &quot;The Three Magpies&quot;.

==History==

&quot;For a timeline of Heathrow events, see Heathrow timeline.&quot;

===Extent and development===
By the 1910s the amenities of Heathrow had grown little since the, at latest, 15th-century laying out of the lane.

It spanned, north–south, from Kings Arbour orchard to Perry Oaks farm (which sat at the junction of the lane and another). An agricultural cluster of buildings and great house Heathrow Hall were slightly toward the north of the lane. All the homes and farms clung to this 90° turning lane, a turn staggered by two bends. Detailed 1910s maps show its unusual continuing agricultural focus so close to London; about half of the buildings and homes were at the two farms. The northern was Heathrow Hall, 500 metres south of the area of Harmondsworth that was from the 16th century until the mid 20th century known as The Magpies, a mix of terraces and houses on and off of the Bath Road, the west of which was a set of 18 densely packed houses, Belch&#x27;s Row and the east of which was Sipson Green, further orchard-backed homes along the Bath Road in the same parish. Heathrow itself had no terraces, instead small cottages and a few larger houses in large grounds. Two offshoot lanes broke away, Cain&#x27;s Lane southeast to New Bedfont and High Tree Lane south to West Bedfont (long part of Stanwell); at the start of Cain&#x27;s Lane was in the 1910s an Anglican Mission room in the heart of the orchards and fields of Perrotts Farm, the other main cluster of buildings of Heathrow. The Diocese of London was keen to give all people a convenient place of worship. By the end of the 19th century The Magpies had a mission church, on the north side of the Bath Road. Sipson Green is covered in the text on the hamlet-turned-village of Sipson. Both remain intrinsic parts of the ecclesiastical parish of Harmondsworth, whose parish priest is as at 2025 Amatu Onundu Christian-Iwuagwu in a church with elements surviving from initial 1067 construction. It will be re-sited or see elements curated in a museum if a third runway for Heathrow Airport receives final planning permission and all appeals are dismissed.

===Founding and early history===
A sizeable Neolithic settlement is believed to have been in the Heathrow area. Many artefacts have been found in the gravel around what is now the airport, and the Colne Valley regional park. Waste pits filled with struck flint, arrowheads and fragments of pottery were also found in the area, indicating a settlement, though none other remains of such a settlement.

Heathrow was one of the last settlements formed in the parish of Harmondsworth. Its name was rendered in various orthographies which reflect approximately the same pronunciation as today &quot;La Hetherewe&quot; (about year 1410, first known mention), &quot;Hithero&quot;, &quot;Hetherow&quot;, &quot;Hetherowfeyld&quot;, &quot;Hitherowe&quot;, and &quot;Heath Row/Heathrow&quot;, Middle English spellings of &quot;heath row&quot; (simply a row (impliedly of houses) on or by a heath). Old maps show Heathrow as a row of houses along the northwest sides of the curve of a lane occasionally named Heathrow Road or Lane, which faced land until 1819 part of a great set of common lands belonging to neighbouring parishes — Hounslow Heath. The first orthography as &quot;Heathrow&quot; dates to 1453.

====Sipson Green earthworks====
Certain Ordnance Survey maps before the Second World War, closer to Sipson Green and the adjoining Harlington Corner (localities of the Bath Road), show an earthwork, 300 metres due south of where New Road, Harlington meets the Bath Road, that had been excavated in 1723 by order of William Stukeley. He believed it to have been a Roman settlement, and named it &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Camp&quot;.

===General Roy&#x27;s western baseline===

In 1784 General William Roy chose the orchard of King&#x27;s Arbour to be one end of first base line of the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790) trigonometrical survey for the first triangles of a triangulation grid reaching across the English Channel. He chose Hounslow Heath for his lines as it was near-flat, near barracks and about 15 miles from the Royal Observatory. The east/south end was the Poor House in Hampton. The ends were originally marked by vertical wooden pipes (which could support flagstaffs), but in the resurvey of 1791 they were found to be rotting and were replaced by upright cannon heads which are still to be seen.

The marker and landmarks on the Bath Road enables visitors and historians to picture features on old maps when visiting today&#x27;s airport, without the use of grid references.

===Great West Aerodrome===

In 1929, Fairey Aviation bought of land just southeast of Heathrow hamlet, to establish an airfield for flight testing; later purchases gradually enlarged the aerodrome to about . It came to be called the Great West Aerodrome, which in 1944 was greatly enlarged to become London Airport, which was later renamed as Heathrow Airport.

===Development===
Agriculture became the main source of income for residents in the hamlet, as the brickearth just as the underlying gravel in soils in the area made for reliable farming for fruit trees and bushes, vegetables, and flowers as it held manure well and markets were in easy reach of these perishable cash crops. Clay soil in other parts of England favoured potatoes and chalk favoured grains. Most residents and seasonal labourers joined in the large west Middlesex market gardening industry. Many residents grew which they would travel with into London to sell, on the return journey collecting manure for farming. As motor vehicles made urban horse manure (from stables and cleaned off roads) much less, local farm workers started instead using sewage sludge (up to annually) from the Perry Oaks sewage works, opened in 1936, as fertiliser.

The farms and buildings across most of south-east Harmondsworth greatly changed in the early 20th century; mostly a web of rural roads and lanes. An illustration being that until about 1930, only one building stood on the north side of Bath Road between Belches Row at The Magpies on the two kilometres to the demolished Kings Head west of the preserved Longford Pump, Longford. Three factories: Technicolor and Penguin Books and Black &amp; Decker were founded in those fields before 1939. No buildings equally stood on the south side of this major thoroughfare.

Other than a few homes and gardens, six farms held land which became the airport in the 1930s, as documented in principal feature maps.

Heathrow was away from main roads and further away from railways; that kept it secluded and quiet although near London. As Middlesex changed to market gardening and fruit growing to supply expanding London, parts of Heathrow held on to old-type mixed farming, and thus was chosen for Middlesex area horse-drawn ploughing competitions, which needed land which was under stubble after harvest.

The ford where High Tree Lane crossed the Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s River was a scenic spot used sometimes for picnics and courting couples. There was a footpath along beside the river from the ford to Longford.

The Middlesex Agricultural and Growers&#x27; Association held annual ploughing matches in Heathrow, until the last, the 99th, was held on 28 September 1937; the 100th match (in 1938) was postponed to 1939 due to severe drought, and in 1939 it was cancelled because World War II had started.

The Royal Commission on Historic Monuments listed 28 historically significant buildings in the parish of Harmondsworth, a third of which were in Heathrow. Notable buildings included Heathrow Hall, a late 18th-century farmhouse, which was on Heathrow Road, and Perry Oaks farm, which was Elizabethan.

In the 19th century much brickearth-type land in west Middlesex, including in Heathrow, was used for orchards of fruit trees, often several sorts mixed in one orchard. Much was grown, often in the orchards under the fruit trees. Sometimes vegetables, or flowers for cutting, were grown under the fruit trees. An author in 1907 reported &quot;thousands and thousands&quot; of plum, cherry, apple, pear, and damson trees, and innumerable currant and gooseberry bushes, round Harmondsworth and Sipson and Harlington and Heathrow. After World War I the amount of fruit growing in the area decreased due to competition from imports and demand for more market-gardening land, and by 1939 less than 10% of the orchard area was left.
Produce was taken to Covent Garden market, or by smaller growers to Brentford market, which was nearer but less profitable. From the Three Magpies, the lane&#x27;s northern end – much reduced and curtailed today – to Covent Garden is which was about 6 hours at laden horse-and-wagon speed; goods had to set off before 10 pm the day before to reach the market when it opened at 4 am, until motor trucks came. Lighter produce such as strawberries where freshness brought highest prices could reach Covent Garden Market in an hour and a half in a light vehicle behind a light fast horse.

An field south of the Bath Road, about east of the lane, was, between 1912 and 1935, allotment gardens (shown on a map dated 1935) and in the 1940 Luftwaffe air survey.

In the 1930s Heathrow Hall and Perry Oaks were mixed farms with wheat, cattle, sheep and pigs, and the other farms were largely market gardening and fruit growing. Photographs from early in the 20th century show to the southeast, at Cain&#x27;s Farm facing modest Heathrow House, milk cattle (about 22 in the photograph) and the yearly horse-drawn ploughing competition on Cain&#x27;s Lane. Later examples show such competitions in the far north-east near Tithe Barn Lane on Heathrow Hall land. In the 1910s a small gravel pit of just under an acre was on the east side of Tithe Barn Lane at the far west of what could be loosely, based mainly on Heathrow Hall&#x27;s ownership be considered part of Heathrow and a similar marsh then pond to the north, all where today&#x27;s Compass Centre stands.

==Archaeology==

===Caesar&#x27;s Camp===
Caesar&#x27;s Camp, also called Schapsbury Hill and Shasbury Hill, was a square, Early Iron Age, British (not Roman) fort site of c. 500 BC, south of Bath Road, about halfway between Heathrow Road and Hatton Road, and a bit north of due east of Heathrow Hall. It was about square (c. 1820 measurement) or square (1911 measurement). It survived because it was on common land until the enclosure of the commons of Harmondsworth parish, after which the fort&#x27;s ramparts were fairly quickly ploughed out.

It was excavated hurriedly in 1944: see timeline below. Inside its rampart 15 circular hut sites were found, and a large rectangular building which was probably a temple. The east end of the north runway obliterated it.

===Fern Hill===
Fern Hill was another ramparted prehistoric site, represented in 1944 by a roughly circular cropmark about in diameter, near Hatton Cross. The site is now partly under an aircraft hangar.

===Terminal 5 site===
Construction of Heathrow Terminal 5 began in September 2002, on the site of the Perry Oaks sewage works, with earthworks for the construction of the buildings&#x27; foundation. The long delay caused by planning discussions allowed a thorough archaeological dig at the site, which found more than 80,000 artefacts.

==Industry==
A brickearth and gravel quarry and brick works was opened in the 1930s. At a survey in 1934 the quarry was , of which was lake. Later it expanded to the northeast and finally the lake was about long. The Heathrow Brick Company went into liquidation in 1943 and was wound up in 1944.
A sewage sludge works was built in the Perry Oaks part of Heathrow in 1934, and a gauge railway installed three years later. Improvements were made in the 1950s and 1960s, and the works were eventually demolished in 2002 to make way for Terminal 5.

The settled sludge of the large Mogden Sewage Treatment Works (West Middlesex Sewage Treatment Works) in Isleworth/Twickenham was pumped west to Perry Oaks for further settling and conversion for use in agriculture in pelleted or powder form as biosolids. Sales were eventually stopped because of the possibility of contamination with toxic
metals.

;Timeline of the sludge works
* 12 June 1931: Middlesex County Council bought the site for £33,000 from W.Whittington &amp; Son, the owners of Perry Oaks farm; it was orchard then.
* 1934: It occupied ; later enlarged.
* 1937: A portable gauge railway was in use on the beds to transport sewage sludge. 
* 1944: The Air Ministry, when taking over Heathrow, tried to take over the sludge works, but for obvious basic hygiene the sludge needed somewhere to be treated, which forced Middlesex County Council to resist; after a volcanic official row the Air Ministry admitted defeat and had to change its plans.
* 1952: The early circular concrete tanks were supplemented with large rectangular tanks, and later by a series of lagoons. 
* 1960s: A large dried sludge storage/collection area was built.
* 1965: This was augmented by installing a conveyor system.
** Both were replaced by centrifuges able to discharge directly into parked trailer units.
* 2002: The second-stage works forming the whole site was replaced by Terminal 5, preceded by a detailed archaeological dig over the area.

It has been inferred that the route of the under-pressure sludge sewer, which needed access points to prevent blockages, could have stopped the building of the airport. He states if it had gone across the Heathrow fields area, e.g. straight from Harlington Corner to Perry Oaks, the amount of work and time in wartime needed to divert it would have stopped the airport from being developed.

==Education==
Heathrow School was founded in 1875, as Heathrow Elementary School, on land given by George Stevens Byng, 2nd Earl of Strafford by the north side of Bath Road. The school opened two years later and was enlarged in 1891. In time the school was renamed &#x27;Sipson and Heathrow School&#x27;, because more than half its pupils came from Sipson.

After the construction of Heathrow Airport started in 1944, the school was affected by aircraft noise from the north runway. Pupils from the few Perry Oaks cottages for more than a year travelled by taxi to avoid construction works, until its sludge-to-fertiliser farm led to the end of almost all its homes. In 1962 the school lost its playing field when an airport access road was built and four years later it moved to Harmondsworth Lane in Sipson, and became Heathrow School again. The school&#x27;s current logo is a Concorde in flight.

<doc id="94090" wikidata="Q149787" url="?curid=94090" title="Hendon">
<text>Hendon is an urban area in the London Borough of Barnet, northwest London northwest of Charing Cross. Hendon was an ancient manor and parish in the county of Middlesex and a former borough, the Municipal Borough of Hendon; it has been part of Greater London since 1965. Hendon falls almost entirely within the NW4 postcode, while the West Hendon part falls in NW9. Colindale to the northwest was once considered part of Hendon but is today separated by the M1 motorway.

The district is most famous for the London Aerodrome which later became the RAF Hendon; from 1972 the site of the RAF station was gradually handed over to housing development and to the RAF Museum. The railways reached Hendon in 1868 with Hendon station on the Midland Main Line, followed by the London Underground further east under the name Hendon Central in 1923. Brent Street emerged as its commercial centre by the 1890s. A social polarity was developed between the uphill areas of Hendon and the lowlands around the railway station.

Hendon is located by numerous arterial roads, namely the A41, A406 (North Circular), the A1 and the M1 motorway. Today Hendon is home to rugby union club Saracens F.C. based at Copthall, and is also home to Middlesex University. It is represented in parliament by its namesake constituency which also includes Edgware and Mill Hill.

==History and locale==


The name means the high place or down, and Hendon&#x27;s motto is &quot;Endeavour&quot;. Hendon was historically a civil parish in the hundred of Gore, county of Middlesex. The manor is described in Domesday (1087), but the name &#x27;Hendun&#x27; – meaning &#x27;at the highest hill&#x27; – is of earlier origin. Evidence of Roman settlement was discovered by members of the Hendon and District Archaeological Society and others; an urn burial of a headless child was found in Sunny Hill Park.

The Midland Railway and the Great Northern Railways were built through Hendon in the 1860s. The underground (Northern line) arrived at Golders Green to the south in 1907, the line being extended to Hendon Central, Colindale and Edgware in 1923–24.

Much of the area developed into a suburb of London and now the area is mostly built-up with some countryside in the Mill Hill area, such as the Copthall playing fields. Hendon&#x27;s industry was mostly centred on manufacturing, and included motor and aviation works, and developed from the 1880s. In 1931 the civil parish of Edgware was abolished and its area was added to the great civil parish of Hendon. This meant Hendon covered everywhere from Edgware and Mill Hill down to Golders Green, Childs Hill and Hampstead Garden Suburb.

Hendon became an urban district in 1894. In 1932 the urban district became the Municipal Borough of Hendon. The municipal borough was abolished in 1965 and the area became part of the London Borough of Barnet.

In 1976, Brent Cross Shopping Centre was built and opened at the southern end of Hendon, to the north of the North Circular Road.

===Church End===

Hendon and District Archaeological Society has found a number of interesting Roman artifacts at Church End but nothing conclusive, and the Saxon settlement near to St Mary&#x27;s Church may not be a continuation of its Roman predecessor. The Domesday Survey mentions a priest, and a church building was documented in 1157. The oldest fabric of the present church is 13th century. The 50 ft tower (c1450) was much restored in the 18th century when the weathercock in the form of a &quot;Lamb and Flag&quot;, the badge of St John, was added.

However, the church is dedicated to St Mary, an enigma that defies local historians to this day. It may be a sign of the (heretical) cult of Mary Magdalene said to have been promoted by the Templars and their successors. Eastern extensions carried out between 1913–15 to designs by architect Temple Moore have greatly expanded the church.

Sir Stamford Raffles, founder of Singapore in 1819, died at his home in nearby Mill Hill and is buried in the church. Another grave of distinction in the churchyard is that of football manager Herbert Chapman who had great success in charge of Northampton Town, Leeds City, Huddersfield Town and finally Arsenal before his sudden death from pneumonia in 1934. Bram Stoker may well have had St Mary&#x27;s graveyard in mind when he created the fictional &quot;Kingstead&quot;, the uneasy resting place of Lucy Westenra, in his book Dracula. However, St Mary&#x27;s graveyard is also the resting place of a more benign spirit, Coventry Patmore&#x27;s wife Emily, the model for the poem The Angel in the House (1854), and upon whom the Victorian ideal of domesticity &quot;the Angel of the Hearth&quot; is based.

Adjacent to the church at the top of Greyhound Hill is the &quot;Greyhound&quot; pub, which was rebuilt in 1898. Originally called the Church House, it was used for vestry meetings from the 1600s to 1878. In 1676 the inn, by then known as the &quot;Greyhound&quot;, burned down in a fire. In 1855 a fire brigade was established, renamed the Hendon volunteer fire brigade in 1866, and a manual fire engine was kept in a building near the church.

Further west, adjacent to the &quot;Greyhound&quot; pub, is the oldest building in Hendon, a 17th-century farmhouse which became the former Church Farmhouse Museum (1955–2011), now part of the campus of nearby Middlesex University.

The &quot;Claddagh Ring&quot; pub, originally known as &quot;The Midland Arms&quot;, in Church Road, Hendon, is somewhat more than nine miles from Athenry (see photo). The sign is genuinely Irish, giving pleasure to a significant Irish community in this area. Another pub, the &quot;Midland Hotel&quot;, close to Hendon station, was opened in 1890 by The Midland Railway Company to provide liquid refreshment for commuters using the Midland Railway. At the time when both of these pubs were open &quot;The Midland Arms&quot; (&quot;The Claddagh Ring&quot;) was known as The Upper Midland and &quot;The Midland Hotel&quot; was known as The Lower Midland. The Irish connection with Hendon goes back at least to the early 19th century when many of that country came here to make the hay, for which Hendon was then famous.

===The Burroughs===
The Burroughs was a distinct hamlet until the 1890s, and appears on an 1873 Ordnance Survey map of the area. The name, known from 1316 until the 19th century as &#x27;the burrows&#x27;, doubtless refers to the keeping of rabbit warrens.

There was an inn and brew-house by the 16th century for travellers, very possibly the White Bear, which was so-called from 1736, and was rebuilt in 1932. Here, the &#x27;leet courts&#x27;, based on feudal tradition, were held as late as 1916, to ensure the rights of the Lord of the Manor to control the increasingly emancipated peasantry, to punish transgressors, and to fix &#x27;Quit-Rent&#x27; for those who had built on manorial land and wastes.

By 1697 the inn was the location for Hendon&#x27;s Whitsun fair. Originally an un-chartered hiring fair for local hay farmers, it was also renowned for dancing and country sports, and was immortalised in the lines of a song of the 1810s:

:Then a soldier fond of battle,
:Who has fought and bled in Spain,
:Finds in Hendon air his mettle,
:Well stirred up to fight again.
:Then a justice of the Quorum
:At Burroughs revels, Hendon Fair,
:Finds such order and decorum
:At the White and Funny Bear.
There was cockfighting during the 1820s, and horse racing in the 1860s; by this time, haymakers were usually contracted directly from Ireland.

From 1735 until 1934 a poorhouse with six cottages used to house older parishioners (and sometimes wrongly called &#x27;alms-houses&#x27;) stood where Quadrant Close (occupied by 1936) is now located. The Poor Law workhouse ceased to be operational when &#x27;Hendon Union Workhouse&#x27; opened in 1835, in what was then &#x27;Red Hill&#x27; and is now Burnt Oak. With the foundation of a Local Board in 1879, the buildings were later used as offices.

In this same period, three religious institutions were established. The first was a Methodist chapel in 1827, which was reached by the footpath of the same name. The second was a Roman Catholic chapel, later called Our Lady of Dolours (1863, remodelled 1927). There were a handful of shops nearby by the 1880s. The modern Methodist chapel, designed by Welch &amp; Lander, was built in 1937.

Grove House (or Hendon Grove), built before 1753, was a private psychiatric hospital by 1900; it was demolished in 1933, having already lost much of its original frontage for building. The remaining estate became a public park, with rumours of a secret tunnel. A number of picturesque 18th- and 19th-century houses survive. The Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ established the Convent of St Joseph, in 1882, and had added a school by 1900.

Hendon Town Hall was built in 1900 from designs by T. H. Watson.

Hendon&#x27;s first proper fire station (1914) was built to designs by A. Welch, and superseded another close by in Church End. Next to the town hall is Hendon Library, built in 1929 to designs by T. M. Wilson. It was considerably rebuilt internally during 1972–3 and 2003–4. Eileen Colwell, the pioneer children&#x27;s librarian, worked for many years at Hendon from the 1930s.

Between 1937 and 1939, the Middlesex County Council built &#x27;Hendon Technical Institute&#x27; (designed by (H. W. Burchett), which became &#x27;Hendon College&#x27;, then in 1973 an Institute of technology called &#x27;Hendon Polytechnic&#x27;, and it is now part of Middlesex University.

Hendon War Memorial was unveiled on St George&#x27;s Day, 23 April 1922, and was moved to its present location in 1962.

===West Hendon and the Hyde===
West Hendon Broadway is part of the arterial A5 road (or Edgware Road), which was Watling Street during Roman Britain. In the 18th century two public houses named &quot;Welsh Harp&quot; were built, giving the popular nickname of the nearby Brent Reservoir. Hendon railway station was opened in 1868 soon followed by Welsh Harp railway station, by the Midland Railway.

This new district developed around the A5 and Hendon rail station became known as &quot;New Hendon&quot; by the 1880s. West Hendon Broadway was served by the Metropolitan Electric Tramways from 1904, which ran from Cricklewood to Edgware on the A5 and later extended northwards to Canons Park and southwards to Acton. Eventually the area formed a popular retail district during this time. West Hendon was devastated by a Luftwaffe bomb in 1941.

To the north, the Hyde was the site of Hendon&#x27;s courthouse opening in 1913 and an open-air swimming pool build by 1922. In 1925 Duple Coachbuilders opened a factory here and were one of the largest employers in Hendon with 800 workers. The coachbuilders even named one of its products &quot;Hendonian&quot;. This factory closed in 1970.

===Parson Street and Holders Hill===

During the 18th century, some of the immediate estate surrounding Hendon Place was auctioned off for large houses, with much of the land being used for building other mansions. Of these, Hendon Hall (later a hotel owned by Hand Picked Hotels but now demolished), built in 1756 at the corner of Ashley Lane, was the last remaining and perhaps the best known. The suggestion that David Garrick, the actor, lived here while he was lord of the manor (1765–1779) is without foundation. A small obelisk in the hotel garden dedicated to William Shakespeare and David Garrick originally stood in Manor Hall Road until 1957. A ceiling painting by Tiepolo, &quot;Olympia and the Four Continents&quot;, was uncovered in 1954, and is now in the Met; but two other large ceiling paintings are still in the house.

A Mr. Somerville laid out Waverley Grove and Tenterden Grove in the 1860s, and by the end of the 19th century the estate saw further development by C.F. Hancock, including houses. On Parson Street, St Swithans was for many years a convent and training house of the Sisters of Nazareth. It is now a Jewish School. Further north is Holders Hill House, now Hasmonean High School.

===Hendon Central===

This busy area around a major road junction contains parades of shops and Hendon Central Underground station. Before the coming of the Underground the area was just open fields. The station opened in 1923, built at the junction of the new Watford Way and a road from Brent Street to the Midland Railway station at West Hendon. A large roundabout was built in front of the station and shops and offices were built. London Electric railways referred to it as the Piccadilly Circus of North West London. During 1923, 687 houses, etc. had been built and plans for a further 1,500 had been passed. Thus the district developed, and the area around the station became an important shopping centre for Hendon.

===Brent Street and Brent Green===

Brent Street was part of a northern route out of London, and at the Quadrant a seven-mile stone – the last piece of physical evidence for the road – is set into a wall. Much of the original small hamlet in Brent Street, which had been there since at least 1613, burned down in a fire in 1861.

Brent Street had a parish pump, which was in disrepair in 1818 owing to the numerous thirsty travellers using the road, and from 1796 there was a cage for criminals (removed in 1883), which stood at the junction of Brent Street and Bell Lane and is now commemorated by a blue plaque. By the 1850s there were at least 13 shops in Brent Street.

Congregationalists built a chapel (1855) and a school in New Brent Street (1856), which later moved and became Bell Lane Board School (1901). Tenby House is the last of three large properties that were built between Finchley Lane and Victoria Road. The Victoria Estate was developed around Victoria and Stratford Roads in the 1870s and 1880s. The cricketer and footballer Denis Compton was brought up here and lived in 47 Alexandra Road, attending Bell Lane Primary School.New Brent Street was the address of the local police office in 1855 (a later station, next to the Post Office at the corner of Brampton Grove and dating from 1884, was demolished in 2002). Christ Church was opened in October 1881 as a chapel of ease for St. Mary&#x27;s, becoming a parish church in 1923.
During the 20th century, a number of small factories were established in the area. The largest was Tilley Lamps Ltd (1915 to 1961), which employed around 300 people and manufactured pressure paraffin lamps (rather charmingly called &quot;Aladdin&quot; lamps in the 1930s). In December 1969, planning permission was granted for the development of a new shopping precinct on Brent Street to be called Sentinel Square, at a cost of £1.5 million, and within a year the old &quot;Rose and Crown&quot; pub, the Classic Cinema (once called the Gala), and a number of shops had been replaced with a collection of modernist shops and a Tesco supermarket. The Odeon at the Quadrant was opened in 1939 at what had been Cook&#x27;s Corner in Parson Street. It was pulled down in 1979 and the site redeveloped for housing.

Salisbury Plain is a piece of wasteland in front of &quot;The Load of Hay&quot; (a pub demolished in 2004), where animals destined for Smithfield were penned overnight. There is a small collection of 18th-century houses along Shirehall Lane, two with fire plaques. Penfold House in Brent Street (not far from the site of &quot;The Load of Hay&quot;) is said to have been built in 1713. It is believed it had been a lodge for drovers bringing cattle up to London, and it was known as Albert Cottage until 1923.
Near to Brent Green was Goodyers House (demolished in 1934), named after an important Hendon family. Where Goodyers House was is now a cul-de-sac called Goodyers Gardens with about 10 or 11 houses. Number 11 was the main house when Goodyers House was still standing. Hendon Park was laid out on Step Fields, part of the Goodyers House estate, and was opened as Queen&#x27;s Park in 1903. In July 1940, there was a particularly large propaganda rally held in Hendon Park – &quot;Rout the Rumour&quot;. Hendon House was home to John Norden, a 16th-century cartographer, but was demolished and replaced with Hendon School. Famous alumni include Peter Mandelson, Rabbi Lionel Blue, and author Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.

==Geography==

Hendon peaks at an elevation of about around Church End, with surrounding areas going downhill, often steeply.

The River Brent runs through Hendon. On 30 November 2009 the Environment Agency warned residents of flooding along the River Brent from Hendon to Brentford, after a day of notably heavy rain. Several premises were temporarily flooded in Brentford and Perivale.

There are two large public parks, Hendon Park in the south and Sunny Hill Park in the north; the latter is separated by the A41 trunk road from the Copthall complex and its adjacent fields.

== Demography ==

According to the 2011 census in Hendon ward, 60% of the population was white, with White British the largest group at 35%, followed by 25% Other White. 17% was Indian, 7% Black African, 5% Other Asian and 4% Chinese. Hendon has a high Jewish population. The West Hendon ward is more diverse with over half of the population being of minority ethnic heritage.

== Transport ==

Hendon is served by Hendon Central tube station on the Edgware Branch of the Northern line (Zone 3/4 on the London Underground network) and by Hendon railway station on National Rail&#x27;s Thameslink service.

Numerous minicab companies operate within Hendon. The main routes that go through Hendon are the A1 (Great North Road); A41 (North Western Avenue), also at various stretches called Hendon Way and Watford Way as well as the A406 (North Circular Road); the last two have a junction that is called the Brent Cross flyover and is known as a traffic blackspot.

Further north is the site of Hendon Aerodrome in an area of Hendon now known as Colindale. It was famous for the first airmail delivery; the first parachute descent from a powered aircraft; the first night flights; and, from RAF Hendon during World War II the RAF provided the first aerial defence of a city. It is believed that the first casualty in the Battle of Britain was an RAF Hurricane pilot from Hendon. It closed to flying in 1968 and is now the site of the RAF Museum, as well as the housing developments at Grahame Park and Beaufort Park.

<doc id="94092" wikidata="Q2571386" url="?curid=94092" title="Heston">
<text>Heston is a suburban area and part of the Hounslow district in the London Borough of Hounslow. The residential settlement covers a slightly smaller area than its predecessor farming village, 10.8 miles (17.4 km) west south-west of Charing Cross and adjoins the M4 motorway but has no junction with it; Heston also adjoins the Great West Road, a dual carriageway, mostly west of the &quot;Golden Mile&quot; headquarters section of it. Heston was, historically, in Middlesex.

==History==
The village of Heston is north of Hounslow, and has been settled since Saxon times. It is first recorded as having a priest in the 7th century, though the present Anglican parish church dates to the 14th century. A charter of Henry II gives the name as Hestune, meaning &quot;enclosed settlement&quot;, which is justified by its location in what was the Warren of Staines, between the ancient Roman road to Bath, and the Uxbridge Road to Oxford. Another suggested etymology is Anglo-Saxon &quot;Hǣs-tūn&quot; = &quot; farm or settlement&quot;.

Before 1229, Heston was part of the parish of Gistleworth (Isleworth) before being taken by Henry III, who subsequently granted it to the Earl of Cornwall. It covered until the late 19th-century creation of Hounslow from outlying parts of two adjoining parishes, . The close association pre-dates the town of Hounslow, when that was simply Hounslow Priory, the two parishes had long been associated: the medieval manor of Isleworth covered all of that parish and this. After Henry III died in 1316, Heston was owned by the Crown, and later by the wardens of St Giles&#x27; Hospital, until it was surrendered to Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Elizabeth I granted Heston to Sir Thomas Gresham, and, after eating some bread made from locally grown wheat, insisted on a supply for her own personal use.

The separation from Isleworth in the 14th century gave the locals a sense of independence from the inhabitants and feudal lords of Isleworth, with whom they frequently quarrelled. The practice of &quot;beating the bounds&quot; was practised annually when the inhabitants went in procession around the parish boundaries, to show locals the extent of their lands. A contemporary account of such a procession describes an occasion when the parishioners of Heston came across some from Isleworth, and the ensuing &quot;quarrel&quot; saw men from Heston throwing the others across a ditch.

A single board of health for the parishes mentioned was formed in 1875 and a very large civil parish in 1927. The Great West Road was completed in 1925, forming the southern border with Hounslow and the farming and market garden land around the village was snapped up for industry and housing developments. The southern part of Heston up to the Great West Road, Sutton (also known as &#x27;The Deans&#x27;), was previously a small hamlet subsequently built up as part of the suburb; this name appearing in some road names and other local features. A Roman Catholic parish church was also built for Heston in the 20th century.

===Heston Aerodrome===

Heston Aerodrome was operational between 1929 and 1947. In September 1938, the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, flew from Heston to Germany three times in two weeks for talks with Adolf Hitler, and he returned to Heston from the Munich Conference with the paper referred to in his later &quot;Peace for our time&quot; speech from 10 Downing Street.

Housing and industrial estates have been built on some of the area that was Heston Aerodrome, and the M4 motorway with its large service area (Heston services) cuts across the former aerodrome site east–west, but a substantial area to the north of the M4 is host to the Airlinks 18-hole golf course. Many of the roads in the area have aviation-related names: Alcock Road (Alcock and Brown), Brabazon Road (Lord Brabazon), Bleriot Road (Louis Blériot), Cobham Road (Sir Alan Cobham), De Havilland Road (Geoffrey de Havilland), Norman Crescent (Nigel Norman), Phoenix Way (Heston Phoenix), Sopwith Road (Thomas Sopwith), Spitfire Way (Supermarine Spitfire), Whittle Road (Frank Whittle), and Wright Road (the Wright brothers).

==Schools==
There are six primary schools in Heston: Edison Primary School, Berkeley, The Rosary Catholic School, Westbrook Primary, Springwell School, Heston Primary School.
Heston Community School is a secondary school with a sixth form.

==Community==
There are three active community groups in Heston: Heston Residents Association, formed in 1918, Heston West Big Local, formed in 2015 and Heston Action Group, formed in 2018.
==Transport==
===London Underground===
Hounslow West tube station is just within the area&#x27;s southern boundary and is ( from the village hall). To the East, the nearest underground station is Osterley tube station ( from the village hall)

===East–West roads===
The A4 Great West Road, having left the historic A315 on the Chiswick–Brentford border, forms the southern border of Heston and then reaches Henlys Roundabout by Hounslow West from which two routes leave. A WNW route passes Heathrow Airport Terminals 1–3 and 5 as the &quot;Bath Road&quot; and a WSW route, the A30, passes Terminal 4, bypasses Staines and reaches the M25; the remainder is for the most part a minor route to Land&#x27;s End, Cornwall.

The M4 motorway is north; its nearest junction is J3, accessed from Hyde Lane or Southall Lane, crossing over the M4 motorway into North Hyde and then turning left (west) to reach the A312, &quot;The Parkway&quot;, north of the junction.

===North–South roads===
The north–south A312, &quot;The Parkway&quot;, to the west of Heston leads south to Feltham and Hampton or north to Harrow passing Waggoners&#x27; Roundabout (WNW of Henlys Roundabout in Hounslow West), Hayes, Yeading and Northolt.

Three minor roads converge on Heston from the A315 in parts of Hounslow, the A3063, A3005 and B363. The single road re-divides just north in Norwood Green into a northwest road to Southall (the A3005) and into the A4127 that passes by Hanwell, briefly using the A4020 west before bypassing Dormers Wells, passing Greenford to reach Sudbury, the town immediately to the west of Wembley and North Wembley.

For longer journeys north, the M4 then M25 provide the best routes. For longer journeys south, Hanworth Road in Hounslow leads to the A316 which becomes the M3 motorway.

<doc id="94094" wikidata="Q124394" url="?curid=94094" title="Highbury">
<text>Highbury is an area in North London and located in the London Borough of Islington. Highbury was owned by Ranulf, brother of Ilger, and included all the areas north and east of Canonbury and Holloway Roads.

The manor house was situated by what is now the east side of Hornsey Road, near the junction with Seven Sisters Road. After the manor decayed, a new manor house was built in 1271 (see below) to the south-east; to differentiate it from the original manor and because it was on a hill, it was called Highbury, from which the area takes its name.

The site for Highbury Manor was possibly used by a Roman garrison as a summer camp. During the construction of a new Highbury House in 1781, tiles were found that could have been Roman or Norman; however, these have been lost.

== Highbury Manor ==
Ownership of Highbury eventually passed to Alicia de Barrow, who in 1271 gave it to the Priory of St John of Jerusalem, also known as the Knights Hospitallers in England. The wealthy Lord Prior built Highbury manor as a substantial stone country lodging with a grange and barn.

In 1381, during the Peasants&#x27; Revolt, Jack Straw led a mob of 20,000 rioters who &quot;so offended by the wealth and haughtiness&quot; of the Knights Hospitallers destroyed the manor house. The Lord Prior at the time, Robert Hales, who had taken refuge in the Tower of London, was captured and beheaded on Tower Hill. Jack Straw and some of his followers used the site as a temporary headquarters; consequently the derelict manor became known for the next 500 years as Jack Straw&#x27;s Castle. This should not be confused with the better known Jack Straw&#x27;s Castle, formerly a pub and now residential flats at Whitestone Ponds, Hampstead, which was named after the semi-legendary leader of the revolt.

== Highbury House ==

The Manor of Highbury remained the possession of the Knights of St John until it was confiscated by Henry VIII in 1540. The land then stayed as crown property until Parliament began selling it in the 17th century.

John Dawes, a real estate developer, acquired the site of Jack Straw&#x27;s Castle together with of surrounding land. In 1781 he built Highbury House at a cost of £10,000 on the spot where Highbury Manor had stood. Over the next 30 years the house was extended by new owners, firstly Alexander Aubert and then John Bentley, to include a large observatory and lavish gardens.

The grounds around Highbury House started to be sold off in 1794. By 1894 Highbury House and its remaining grounds became a school. Finally in 1938 Highbury House was demolished and is now the site of Eton House flats (on Leigh Road), built by the Old Etonian Housing Association in 1939.

== Highbury Barn ==
After the Manor house had been destroyed in 1381, the grange and barn remained on the east side of the track that ran south to Hopping Lane, now St Paul&#x27;s Road, roughly on the line of Highbury Park / Highbury Grove (the A1201). In 1740 a small ale and cake house was opened in the Barn, Highbury.

In 1770 William Willoughby took over Highbury Barn and greatly increased its popularity. He expanded its size and facilities, taking over land and buildings from the farm next door, reaching beyond what is now Kelvin Road and created a bowling green, trap-ball grounds and gardens. It could cater for company dinners of 2,000 people, concerts and dancing and became one of the most popular venues in London.

In 1854 events at the annual balls in the grounds of the Barn included the aeronaut Charles Green&#x27;s balloon ascent. By 1865 there was a huge dancing platform, a rebuilt theatre, high-wire acts, pantomime, music hall and the original Siamese twins. The Barn became the victim of its own success. After a riot led by students from Bart&#x27;s Hospital in 1869, locals complained about the Barn&#x27;s increasingly riotous and bawdy clientele. This led to a court case and in 1871 authorities revoked the Barn&#x27;s dancing licence.

== Residential growth ==

By 1794 Highbury consisted of Highbury House and Highbury Hill House, Highbury Barn and the gated terraces of Highbury Terrace and Highbury Place, which had been built on land leased by John Dawes. Highbury may have stayed this way, as the plan was to create a park – Albert Park – between St Paul&#x27;s Road/Balls Pond Road and the Seven Sisters Road. Instead a site, which is now Highbury Fields was saved in 1869 and the Finsbury Park were created. The rest of the area was developed.

The greater part of the development of the area occurred in two phases; until the 1870s many large Italianate villas were built, mostly in the southern part of Highbury. After this time, development went high-density with close packed mostly terraced houses being built, mainly in the north of Highbury. Available land continued to be in-filled with more housing until 1918, but little else changed until after World War II.

A need for a place for Catholic residents of Highbury to worship in the 1920s led to the commissioning of St Joan of Arc&#x27;s church, thought to be the first dedicated to the saint canonised in 1920, on a site on Kelross Road where the church hall is now located. The church was soon expanded, but the influx of Catholic residents after the war led to a need for a new, larger church. The new church, also dedicated to St Joan of Arc, and designed by Stanley Kerr Bate, opened on 23 September 1962 on Highbury Park.

Highbury was bombed during the Blitz and again by V-1 flying bombs. On 27 June 1944, a V-1 destroyed Highbury Corner, killing 26 people and injuring 150. Highbury Corner had an impressive station and hotel which were damaged in this attack but its main building remained in use until demolished in the 1960s during the building of the Victoria Line. The original westbound platform buildings remain on the opposite side of Holloway Road, as does a small part of the original entrance to the left of the present station entrance. A red plaque, mounted on a building wall overlooking the roundabout, commemorates this event.

After the Second World War large-scale rebuilding in parts of Highbury replaced bombed buildings and provided new municipal housing. Some villas that had not been modernised were demolished to make way for yet more municipal housing; some buildings had to be listed to protect them. Following the property boom in the early 1980s, there has been some gentrification in the area and the council has begun selling some of the grand villas to private developers who have the finances to restore them, e.g. in 2004 Islington council sold four buildings on Highbury New Park to developers for £1 million each.

The Highbury Community Association (HCA) was formed in 1997. Since then, the HCA has grown to represent residents and businesses in Highbury, Lower Holloway and Finsbury Park. The HCA campaigns on many different aspects of living and working in this area of North Islington in London.

== Arsenal Stadium ==
In 1913 Woolwich Arsenal F.C. moved north to Highbury, dropping Woolwich from its name. Their chairman Sir Henry Norris took a 20-year lease on part of the grounds of St John&#x27;s Hall for £20,000. The new Arsenal Stadium (also called Highbury) was built there. St John&#x27;s Hall, originally called Highbury College (of Divinity), was built in 1825 on what is now Aubert Park and was a grand ionic-style building, reminiscent of the British Museum. St John&#x27;s Hall burnt down in 1946 and was replaced by a block of flats.

The club prospered and by 1925 had purchased the freehold. Arsenal&#x27;s subsequent success made Highbury well known, albeit initially with depressing effect on nearby housing. In 2006 the club moved to Ashburton Grove on the west side of Drayton Park in Highbury. The old stadium was converted into a luxury housing complex known as Highbury Square, with the two listed main stands being converted into apartments, ensuring their original exteriors remained almost entirely preserved. The unlisted North Bank and Clock End stands have been demolished to make way for entirely new apartment blocks. The pitch has been converted into a garden, with private gym and swimming pool located underneath it. Today, property in the area around the old Highbury stadium is highly sought after, and prices for apartments within the stadium start at £300k.

== Highbury in the arts ==

For 40 years from 1965, Highbury New Park was home to Wessex Studios. Created by the Beatles producer Sir George Martin (who grew up on Drayton Park in Highbury), the studios saw the recording of some of the best-known albums created by bands including Queen, Genesis, the Rolling Stones, the Sex Pistols and the Clash. The building is now a block of residential apartments called &quot;The Recording Studio&quot; and located at 106, Highbury New Park. (Refs: George Martin speaking on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s Desert Island Discs; The Independent, 3 November 2004; the &quot;Queen – Days of our Lives&quot; documentary screened by BBC4 in April 2012.)

Highbury was also home to Highbury Studios, a film/TV/recording studio further along the same street, at 65A Highbury New Park; these studios had a training school next door in a disused church hall. Built initially as a music conservatoire in 1890, the site became a recording studio in 1926 for the Piccadilly label. In 1933, they became the Highbury (film) Studios and in 1945 they were acquired by the Rank Organisation. Due to economic difficulties, Rank closed the studios down and they were demolished in 1960. Athenaeum Court, a block of flats, now occupies the site.

As of September 2019, Highbury is home to the London Screen Academy (LSA), a state-funded sixth form college located on Highbury Grove opposite Christ Church. LSA is dedicated to training young people of all backgrounds in behind-the-camera skills. LSA&#x27;s founders include Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner of Working Title Films, Lisa Bryer of Cowboy Films, David Heyman of Heyday Films, and Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson of Eon Productions.

The following books and films feature parts of Highbury:
*The book &quot;A London Family 1870–1900&quot; by Molly Hughes, . In particular it mentions Highbury New Park.
*The book &quot;The Rescue Man by Anthony Quinn &quot;. The dramatic book finishes with scenes at Highbury Corner on 27 June 1944 after an attack by V-1 flying bomb. 
*The film &quot;Killing Her Softly&quot; was partially filmed on Highbury New Park.
*The film &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; was filmed around the Arsenal stadium and along Highbury Hill.
*The film &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; begins with Hugh Grant trying to hail a taxi at Highbury Corner and ends in front of the houses that run along the edge of Highbury Fields.
*The film &quot;The Arsenal Stadium Mystery&quot; was filmed in and around the Arsenal stadium.
*The poem &quot;Summoned by Bells&quot; by John Betjeman. This verse autobiography mentions Highbury several times, including St Saviours Church on Aberdeen Park, which he used to attend. St Saviours closed in 1980 and is now an art studio.
*Highbury is where the fictional comedy character Mr. Bean lives.
*Writer Alan Moore recorded a &#x27;beat seance&#x27; in and about Highbury, titled &#x27;The Highbury Working&#x27;.
*In the early 70s a drama was filmed by the BBC called &quot;The House on Highbury Hill&quot;.
*Highbury is mentioned in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, the novel by William Makepeace Thackeray; in chapter 4, the Sedleys are said to be going &quot;to dine with Alderman Balls, at Highbury Barn.&quot;
*The novel &quot;Emma&quot; by Jane Austen is set in a village called Highbury, though located in Surrey.This information is fairly pertinent here, since Austen&#x27;s fictitious Highbury village might otherwise be confused with the Islington area. This is so despite the author&#x27;s placing Emma&#x27;s Highbury &#x27;sixteen miles from London&#x27; and the fact that it is regarded by perhaps most Austen scholars as imagined to be in Surrey.
*Highbury is mentioned in The Fire Sermon, part III of T.S. Eliot&#x27;s The Waste Land: &quot;Highbury bore me. Richmond and Kew / Undid me.&quot;
Highbury is the setting of Andrea Levy&#x27;s autobiographical novel, Every Light in the House Burnin&#x27;.

<text>In Greek mythology, Axylus (Ancient Greek: Ἄξυλος) was a Trojan warrior who participated in the Trojan War.

== Family ==
Axylus was the son of Teuthranus.

== Mythology ==
Axylus was a wealthy and young man who came from the town of Arisbe, a city in the Troad. He was killed by Diomedes during the siege of Troy.

This character was mentioned in Book VI of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;:Diomedes, expert in war cries, killed Axylus,&lt;br&gt;son of Teuthranus, a rich man, from well-built Arisbe.&lt;br&gt;People really loved him, for he lived beside a road,&lt;br&gt;welcomed all passers-by into his home.&lt;br&gt;But not one of those men he&#x27;d entertained now stood&lt;br&gt;in front of him, protecting him from wretched death.&lt;br&gt;Diomedes took the lives of two men--Axylus,&lt;br&gt;and his attendant Calesius, his charioteer.&lt;br&gt;So both men went down into the underworld.

<text>Highgate is a suburban area of north west London at the northeastern corner of Hampstead Heath in the London Boroughs of Camden, Islington and Haringey, north-northwest of Charing Cross.

Highgate is one of the most expensive London suburbs in which to live. It has three active conservation organisations: the Highgate Society, the Highgate Neighbourhood Forum and the Highgate Conservation Area Advisory Committee, to protect and enhance its character and amenities.

Until late Victorian times, it was a distinct village outside London, sitting astride the main road to the north. The area retains many green expanses, including the eastern part of Hampstead Heath, three ancient woods, Waterlow Park and the eastern-facing slopes, known as Highgate bowl.

At its centre is Highgate village, largely a collection of Georgian shops, pubs, restaurants and residential streets, interspersed with diverse landmarks such as St Michael&#x27;s Church and steeple, St. Joseph&#x27;s Church and its green copper dome, Highgate School (1565), Jacksons Lane arts centre, housed in a Grade II listed former church, the Gatehouse Inn, dating from 1670, which houses the theatre Upstairs at the Gatehouse and Berthold Lubetkin&#x27;s 1930s Highpoint buildings. Pond Square, behind the High Street, is a registered village green, and is the centre of communal activities which take place in the elegant buildings of the Highgate Literary and Scientific Institution and Highgate Society facing the Square.

Highgate is best known for the Victorian Highgate Cemetery, in which the Communist philosopher Karl Marx and the novelist George Eliot are buried, along with many other notable people. Adjoining is Holly Village, the first gated community, built in 1865, which is a Grade II* listed site.

The village is at the top of Highgate Hill, which provides views across central London. Highgate is above sea level at its highest point.

The area is divided among three London boroughs: Haringey in the north and east, Camden in the south and west, and Islington in the south and east. The postal district is N6.

==History==

Historically, Highgate adjoined the Bishop of London&#x27;s hunting estate. Highgate gets its name from these hunting grounds, as there was a high, deer-proof hedge surrounding the estate: &#x27;the gate in the hedge&#x27;.

The bishop kept a toll-house where one of the main northward roads out of London entered his land. A number of pubs sprang up along the route, one of which, the Gatehouse, commemorates the toll-house.

Hampstead Lane and Highgate Hill contain the red brick Victorian buildings of Highgate School and its adjacent Chapel of St Michael. The school has played a paramount role in the life of the village and has existed on its site since its founding was permitted by letters patent from Queen Elizabeth I in 1565.

The area north of Hampstead Lane and east of the High Street was part of Hornsey parish and also later the Municipal Borough of Hornsey, and the seat of that borough&#x27;s governing body for many years.

Highgate Hill, the steep street linking Archway (traditionally called part of Upper Holloway) and Highgate village, was the route of the Highgate Hill Cable Tramway, the first cable car to be built in Europe. It operated between 1884 and 1909.

Like much of London, Highgate suffered damage during World War II by German air raids. The local tube station was used as a bomb shelter.
Highgate New Town is a post-war estate adjacent to the cemetery, designed by Camden Council with similarities to the Alexandra Road estate.

==Governance==
Between 1983 and 2010 Highgate was part of the Hampstead and Highgate constituency. The Boundary Commission report of 2003 recommended removing the Camden part of Highgate from the remainder of that constituency and joining it with Kentish Town and Holborn to the south in order to form an enlarged Holborn and St Pancras constituency from the 2010 general election. 

Since 1983 the northern half of Highgate village was part of the Hornsey and Wood Green constituency. Until 2023 the southern half of Highgate was in the Holborn &amp; St Pancras Parliamentary constituency whose MP is Keir Starmer of the Labour Party, the party&#x27;s current leader. The whole of Highgate Village is now part of the Hampstead and Highgate (UK Parliament constituency).

==Education==
== Religion ==
Highgate&#x27;s main Church of England parish church, St Michael&#x27;s, is situated close to the summit of the hill, and is the highest church in Greater London. It was built as one of the Commissioners&#x27; churches in 1831 and consecrated and opened on 8 November 1832. The architect was Lewis Vulliamy, and in 1831 his original drawings for the church were exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts.

From the late 17th century until 1830 Ashhurst House, the home of former Lord Mayor of London Sir William Ashhurst, stood on the site of the church. The remains of the house&#x27;s cellar now form part of the church&#x27;s crypt.

The church&#x27;s spire, built of Bath stone, with a cross of Portland stone, is a landmark on London&#x27;s northern skyline.

Inside, the chancel and choir stalls were done by G. E. Street in 1880. The pulpit dates from 1848. The present bench pews date from 1879, replacing box pews. The present organ is by Hill and Davidson, and was installed in 1885, replacing an earlier instrument of 1842. It was overhauled in 1985.

There is a monument to Samuel Taylor Coleridge and his family in the form of a slate slab in the middle of the church.

The church was damaged in the Second World War by enemy air raids and the present stained glass window at the east end was installed in 1954, replacing a window broken in the Blitz. It is one of the last works by Evie Hone and depicts the Last Supper.

Further down Highgate Hill is the town&#x27;s Roman Catholic parish church, St Joseph&#x27;s. It was designed by Albert Vickers, and built in 1888, replacing an earlier, smaller church of 1861. Although St Joseph&#x27;s Church was opened in 1889 by the Bishop of Liverpool, it was not until 1932, when its debts were cleared, that it was officially consecrated.

The church has a distinctive copper dome with a green patina, and the interior of the dome was painted by Nathaniel Westlake in 1891. The organ is by William Hill and Sons, and installed in 1945 as a memorial to the local victims of the Second World War.

== 1980s murder ==
On Friday 26 August 1988, Michael Williams, a 43-year-old father from Highgate who worked for the Home Office in Pimlico, disappeared while travelling back home after an employee social. His body was found at Highgate Wood the next day. The case remains unsolved despite being featured heavily in the national press and on the BBC&#x27;s TV programme &quot;Crimewatch&quot;.

==Notable inhabitants==

Highgate Cemetery is the burial place of Communist philosopher Karl Marx, Michael Faraday, Douglas Adams, George Eliot, Jacob Bronowski, Sir Ralph Richardson, Dawn Foster, Christina Rossetti, Sir Sidney Nolan, Alexander Litvinenko, Malcolm McLaren, Radclyffe Hall, Joseph Wolf and singer-songwriter George Michael.

Many notable alumni have passed through Highgate School, either Masters or indeed Old Cholmeleians, the name given to old boys of the school. These include T.S. Eliot, who taught the poet laureate John Betjeman there, Gerard Manley Hopkins the poet, the composers John Taverner and John Rutter, John Venn the inventor of Venn diagrams, actor Geoffrey Palmer, Anthony Crosland MP and Labour reformer, and the cabinet minister Charles Clarke.

A blue plaque on a house at the top of North Hill notes that Charles Dickens stayed there in 1832, when he was 20 years old.

Peter Sellers lived as a boy in a cottage in Muswell Hill Road, where his mother had moved in order to send him to the Catholic St Aloysius Boys&#x27; School in Hornsey Lane.

In Victorian times St Mary Magdalene House of Charity in Highgate was a refuge for former prostitutes—&quot;fallen women&quot;—where Christina Rossetti was a volunteer from 1859 to 1870. It may have inspired her best-known poem, Goblin Market.

Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; bassist Steven Severin was born and brought up there.

===Coleridge===
In 1817 the poet, aesthetic philosopher and critic Samuel Taylor Coleridge came to live at 3, The Grove, Highgate, the home of Dr James Gillman, in order to rehabilitate from his opium addiction. After Dr Gillman built a special wing for the poet, Coleridge lived there for the rest of his life, becoming known as the sage of Highgate.

While here some of his most famous poems, though written years earlier, were first published including &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;. His literary autobiography, &quot;Biographia Literaria&quot;, appeared in 1817. While living there he became friends with his neighbour Joseph Hardman. His home became a place of pilgrimage for figures such as Carlyle and Emerson. He died here on 25 July 1834 and is buried in the crypt of nearby St Michael&#x27;s Church. The writer J. B. Priestley subsequently lived in the same house; a commemorative plaque marks the property.

==In popular culture==

* Highgate&#x27;s historic feel—in particular the gothic atmosphere of its cemetery—has provided the backdrop to a considerable number of films, including Hammer Horror films of the 1970s and, more recently, &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald&quot; and &quot;Dorian Gray&quot;.
* The pub tradition of Swearing on the Horns originated in Highgate.
* In Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, James Steerforth lives in a house at the top of Highgate West Hill.

<text>Holborn ( or ), an area in central London, covers the south-eastern part of the London Borough of Camden and a part (St Andrew Holborn Below the Bars) of the Ward of Farringdon Without in the City of London.

The area has its roots in the ancient parish of Holborn, which lay on the west bank of the now buried River Fleet; the district takes its name from an alternative name for the river: the Holbourne (or Oldbourne). The area is sometimes described as part of the West End of London or of the wider West London area.

The River Fleet also gave its name to the streets &quot;Holborn&quot; and &quot;High Holborn&quot; which extend west from the site of the former Newgate in the London Wall, over the Fleet, through Holborn and towards Westminster.

The district benefits from a central location which helps provide a strong mixed economy. The area is particularly noted for its links to the legal profession, for the diamond centre at Hatton Garden and for Great Ormond Street Hospital.

== Origins and administration ==
Holborn emerged from the ancient parish of St Andrew Holborn and its later sub-divisions. The parish church is first mentioned, and described as &quot;old&quot;, in a charter of 959, but this is before the parish or the landholdings on which it was based took on anything like their settled form.

=== Toponymy ===

The earliest surviving written record of the area occurs in a charter of AD 959, in which King Edgar the Peaceful granted Westminster Abbey an area of land (much larger than the later parish of Holborn) stretching from the Abbey, on Thorney Island, to the River Fleet. The charter mentions &quot;the old wooden church of St Andrew&quot; (St Andrew, Holborn). The name Holborn is used in the charter, but it refers to the River Fleet rather than the district.

The name &quot;Holborn&quot; may derive from the Middle English &quot;hol&quot; for &quot;hollow&quot;, and &quot;bourne&quot;, a &quot;brook&quot;, referring to the River Fleet as it ran through a steep valley (hollow) in places.

However, the 16th-century historian John Stow attributes the name to a different watercourse: the &quot;Old Bourne&quot; (&quot;old brook&quot;), a small stream which he believed ran into the Fleet at Holborn Bridge. This structure was lost when the river was culverted in 1732. The exact course of the stream is uncertain, but according to Stow it started in one of the many small springs near Holborn Bar, the old City toll gate on the summit of Holborn Hill. Other historians, however, find the theory implausible, in view of the slope of the land.

===Administration: Parish and Ward===
The Parish of St Andrew, Holborn, was divided by a civil boundary, with part within the Farringdon Without ward of the City of London (later known as &quot;St Andrew Holborn Below the Bars&quot;) – which includes the parish church and the part within the Ossulstone Hundred of Middlesex (later known as &quot;St Andrew Above the Bars&quot;).
It is not known when the parish of Holborn took on its settled form, but it is likely to have been by the time of the introduction of Canon Law around 1180, with records from the time the hospital of St Giles was established in 1120 indicating that the parish extended further west at that time, presumably to encompass what would become the combined parish of St Giles and Bloomsbury.

A charter of around 1000 shows the boundaries of the city being pushed west to their settled historic extent in around 1000, though this extramural area would have been very sparsely settled. The city&#x27;s wards take shape in the 11th century, before the Norman Conquest. The civil division of the parish is very ancient and predates the establishment of the parish in its settled form. In 1394 the Ward of Farringdon was subdivided into Farringdon Within and Farringdon Without, with south-east Holborn part of the latter.

The City Bars mark the boundary of the City of London within Holborn. In 1994 the City boundary shifted slightly to the junction of Chancery Lane and the Bars were moved accordingly.

===Many Civil Parishes===

It has been described how the two parts of the parish came under separate civil governance (though without any civil governance at parish level) according to whether the part was in the city or outside. From the Tudor period onwards new local government were introduced in England, and parish areas were obliged to take on civil as well as ecclesiastical responsibilities for the first time, this started with relief of the poor.

The two parts became, for civil but not ecclesiastical purposes, two separate parishes known as &quot;St Andrew Holborn Below the Bars&quot; and &quot;St Andrew Holborn Above the Bars&quot;, the &quot;Bars&quot; being the City boundary markers. The area &quot;above Bars&quot; (outside the city&#x27;s jurisdiction) was organised by the vestry board of the parish of St Andrew.
As well as Holborn&#x27;s two main civil parishes, there were a number of extra-parochial areas, parts of the ecclesiastical parish of Holborn but formed their own (usually tiny) civil parish areas:
* Liberty of Saffron Hill, Hatton Garden, Ely Rents and Ely Place
* Lincoln&#x27;s Inn (excluding Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, in the combined parish of &quot;St Giles and Bloomsbury&quot;)
* Thavie&#x27;s Inn
* Barnard&#x27;s Inn
* Furnival&#x27;s Inn
* Gray&#x27;s Inn
* Staple Inn

===Response to urbanisation===
The St George the Martyr Queen Square area became a separate parish, for both civil and ecclesiastical matters, in 1723; but for civil matters was reunited with the part of St Andrew outside the city (&quot;Above the Bars&quot;) of London in 1767, to form St Andrew Holborn Above the Bars with St George the Martyr.

The Holborn District was created in 1855, consisting of the civil parishes and extra-parochial places of Holborn outside the city; St Andrew Holborn Above the Bars with St George the Martyr, Saffron Hill, Hatton Garden, Ely Rents and Ely Place, as well as two tiny units that were added from the Finsbury Division: Glasshouse Yard and St Sepulchre, Middlesex.
The Metropolitan Borough of Holborn was created in 1900, consisting of the former area of the Holborn District and the St Giles District, but the small units previously part of the Finsbury Division were instead included in the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury. The Metropolitan Borough of Holborn was abolished in 1965 and its area now forms part of the London Borough of Camden.

==Latter history==
===Urban growth===
The westward growth of London beyond the City Wall, and towards the seat of government in Westminster, took place along the banks of the River Thames and along the roads leading from Ludgate (Fleet Street and The Strand) and Newgate (&quot;Holborn&quot; and &quot;High Holborn&quot;). This growth, initially limited to Farringdon Without (which includes a part of Holborn) was well underway in the 12th century, leading to the Ward being retrospectively described as the capital&#x27;s original West End.

In the 12th century St Andrew&#x27;s was noted in local title deeds as lying on &quot;Holburnestrate&quot;—Holborn Street, but as the street leads from Roman Newgate, and the church was sited on it by the 10th century, it is probably considerably older. In 1394 the population had grown so large that the Ward of Farringdon had grown too large for effective governance and was formally divided into the separate Wards, (rather than separate named areas within the same Ward) in 1394.

The westward growth towards Westminster accelerated in the Tudor period. The westerly ribbon development through the parish was complete before the Great Fire of 1666, with the displacement of people accelerating the development of the rest of the area. The northern fringe the last area to be developed, with this process finalised in the 18th century.

===Medieval===
St Etheldreda&#x27;s Church, in gated Ely Place, was originally the chapel of the Bishop of Ely&#x27;s London palace. This ecclesiastical connection allowed the street to remain part of the county of Cambridgeshire until the mid-1930s. This meant that Ye Olde Mitre, a pub located in a court hidden behind the buildings of the Place and the Garden, was licensed by the Cambridgeshire Magistrates.

St Etheldreda&#x27;s is the oldest Roman Catholic church in Britain, and one of two extant buildings in London dating back to the era of EdwardI.

===Tudor and Stuart periods===
Henry VII paid for the road to be paved in 1494 because the thoroughfare &quot;was so deep and miry that many perils and hazards were thereby occasioned, as well to the king&#x27;s carriages passing that way, as to those of his subjects&quot;. Criminals from the Tower and Newgate passed up Holborn on their way to be hanged at Tyburn or St Giles.

Hatton Garden, the centre of the diamond trade, was leased to a favourite of Queen Elizabeth I, Sir Christopher Hatton, at the insistence of the Queen to provide him with an income.


The area was not damaged by the Great Fire of London in 1666, though the area of destruction reached its south-eastern boundary.

===Legal profession===
Charles Dickens took up residence in Furnival&#x27;s Inn (later the site of &quot;Holborn Bars&quot;, the former Prudential building designed by Alfred Waterhouse). Dickens put his character &quot;Pip&quot;, in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, in residence at Barnard&#x27;s Inn opposite, now occupied by Gresham College. Staple Inn, notable as the promotional image for Old Holborn tobacco, is nearby. The three of these were Inns of Chancery. The most northerly of the Inns of Court, Gray&#x27;s Inn, is off Holborn, as is Lincoln&#x27;s Inn: the area has been associated with the legal professions since mediaeval times, and the name of the local militia (now Territorial Army unit, the Inns of Court &amp; City Yeomanry) still reflects that. The unit is nicknamed the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Own&quot;, a name given by George III, not due to ferocity in battle, but rather to his dislike of lawyers.

===Historic points of interest===
In the 18th century, Holborn was the location of the infamous Mother Clap&#x27;s molly house (meeting place for homosexual men). There were 22 inns or taverns recorded in the 1860s. The Holborn Empire, originally Weston&#x27;s Music Hall, stood between 1857 and 1960, when it was pulled down after structural damage sustained in the Blitz. The theatre premièred one of the first full-length feature films in 1914, &quot;The World, the Flesh and the Devil&quot;, a 50-minute melodrama filmed in Kinemacolor.

Subsequently, the area diversified and become recognisable as the modern street. A plaque stands at number 120 commemorating Thomas Earnshaw&#x27;s invention of the Marine chronometer, which facilitated long-distance travel. At the corner of Hatton Garden was the old family department store of Gamages. Until 1992, the London Weather Centre was located in the street. The Prudential insurance company relocated in 2002. The Daily Mirror offices used to be directly opposite it, but the site is now occupied by Sainsbury&#x27;s head office.

Behind the Prudential Building lies the Anglo-Catholic church of St Alban the Martyr. Originally built in 1863 by architect William Butterfield, it was gutted during the Blitz but later reconstructed, retaining Butterfield&#x27;s west front.

On Holborn Circus lies the Church of St Andrew, an ancient Guild Church that survived the Great Fire of London. However, the parochial authority decided to commission Sir Christopher Wren to rebuild it. Although the nave was destroyed in the Blitz, the reconstruction was faithful to Wren&#x27;s original. Just to the west of the circus, but originally sited in the middle, is a large equestrian statue of Prince Albert by Charles Bacon, erected in 1874 as the city&#x27;s official monument to him. It was presented by Charles Oppenheim, of the diamond trading company De Beers, whose headquarters is in nearby Charterhouse Street.
== Geography ==
The district can best be described in reference to the ancient parish and the sub-divisions that succeeded it, however the area is not an administrative unit so contemporary perceptions of its extent can be vague and highly variable. In particular there are overlapping perceptions of the extent of the districts of Holborn, Bloomsbury and St Giles. One of the many factors in this, is a tendency to conflate the &quot;Holborn&quot; and &quot;High Holborn&quot; roads with the district.

The now buried River Fleet formed the historic eastern boundary of the ancient parish of Holborn, a course now marked by Farringdon Street, Farringdon Road and other streets. The northern boundary with St Pancras was formed by a tributary of the Fleet later known as Lamb&#x27;s Conduit. The curving alignment of Roger Street follows part of the course of that lost brook, and marked the northern boundary of the parish and later borough.

The area extends west from Farringdon Street, for three-quarters of a mile, roughly as far as Southampton Row and Holborn tube station. The station was originally named &quot;Holborn (Kingsway)&quot; as it was on the junction of those two roads. Most of the area lies north of the eponymous road, rather than to the south.

=== Transport ===
The nearest London Underground stations are Chancery Lane and Holborn. The closest mainline railway station is City Thameslink.

Holborn is served by bus routes 1, 8, 19, 25, 38, 55, 59, 68, 76, 91, 98, 133, 168, 171, 188, 243, 341, X68 and night routes N1, N8, N19, N38, N41, N55, N68 and N171.

== Economy ==
In the early 21st century, Holborn has become the site of new offices and hotels. For example, the old neoclassical Pearl Assurance building near the junction with Kingsway was converted into a hotel in 1999.
There has been attempts by some commercial organisations to rebrand the southern parts of the London Borough of Camden (Holborn, Bloomsbury and St Giles; the former Metropolitan Borough of Holborn) as &quot;Midtown&quot;. This area, is notionally in the very middle of London, being situated between the Westminster and the City, but this Americanisation has been widely criticised and not accepted or used by Londoners.

==Representation==

The MPs for the area are:
* Keir Starmer MP, the Labour Party Member of Parliament for Holborn and St Pancras;
* Rachel Blake, the Labour MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, which includes the City of London portion of Holborn.

The three ward councillors for Holborn and Covent Garden, representing the London Borough of Camden part of the district are:
* Cllr Julian Fulbrook, Cllr Sue Vincent and Cllr Awale Olad of the Labour Party.

Holborn is represented in the London Assembly as part of Barnet and Camden by:
* Andrew Dismore, of the Labour Party.

== Notes ==
*a. Pronunciation: The BBC Pronunciation Unit recommends &quot;ˈhəʊbə(r)n&quot; but allows &quot;sometimes also hohl-buhrn&quot;. The organisation&#x27;s less formal &quot;Pronouncing British Placenames&quot; notes, &quot;You&#x27;ll occasionally find towns where nobody can agree... Holborn in central London has for many years been pronounced &#x27;hoe-bun&#x27;, but having so few local residents to preserve this, it&#x27;s rapidly changing to a more natural &#x27;hol-burn&#x27;&quot;. However, &quot;Modern British and American English pronunciation&quot; (2008) cites &quot;Holborn&quot; as one of its examples of a common word where the &quot;l&quot; is silent. The popular tourist guide &quot;The Rough Guide to Britain&quot; sticks to the traditional form, with neither &quot;l&quot; nor &quot;r&quot;: .

<doc id="94102" wikidata="Q208476" url="?curid=94102" title="Solid angle">
<text>In geometry, a solid angle (symbol: ) is a measure of the amount of the field of view from some particular point that a given object covers. That is, it is a measure of how large the object appears to an observer looking from that point.
The point from which the object is viewed is called the &quot;apex&quot; of the solid angle, and the object is said to &quot;subtend&quot; its solid angle at that point.

In the International System of Units (SI), a solid angle is expressed in a dimensionless unit called a &quot;steradian&quot; (symbol: sr), which is equal to one square radian, sr = rad2. One steradian corresponds to one unit of area (of any shape) on the unit sphere surrounding the apex, so an object that blocks all rays from the apex would cover a number of steradians equal to the total surface area of the unit sphere, formula_1. Solid angles can also be measured in squares of angular measures such as degrees, minutes, and seconds.

A small object nearby may subtend the same solid angle as a larger object farther away. For example, although the Moon is much smaller than the Sun, it is also much closer to Earth. Indeed, as viewed from any point on Earth, both objects have approximately the same solid angle (and therefore apparent size). This is evident during a solar eclipse.

== Definition and properties ==

The magnitude of an object&#x27;s solid angle in steradians is equal to the area of the segment of a unit sphere, centered at the apex, that the object covers. Giving the area of a segment of a unit sphere in steradians is analogous to giving the length of an arc of a unit circle in radians. Just as the magnitude of a plane angle in radians at the vertex of a circular sector is the ratio of the length of its arc to its radius, the magnitude of a solid angle in steradians is the ratio of the area covered on a sphere by an object to the square of the radius of the sphere. The formula for the magnitude of the solid angle in steradians is 

formula_2

where formula_3 is the area (of any shape) on the surface of the sphere and formula_4 is the radius of the sphere.

Solid angles are often used in astronomy, physics, and in particular astrophysics. The solid angle of an object that is very far away is roughly proportional to the ratio of area to squared distance. Here &quot;area&quot; means the area of the object when projected along the viewing direction.

The solid angle of a sphere measured from any point in its interior is 4 sr. The solid angle subtended at the center of a cube by one of its faces is one-sixth of that, or 2/3  sr. The solid angle subtended at the corner of a cube (an octant) or spanned by a spherical octant is /2  sr, one-eight of the solid angle of a sphere.

Solid angles can also be measured in square degrees (1 sr = 2 square degrees), in square arc-minutes and square arc-seconds, or in fractions of the sphere (1 sr = fractional area), also known as spat (1 sp = 4 sr).

In spherical coordinates there is a formula for the differential,

formula_5

where is the colatitude (angle from the North Pole) and is the longitude.

The solid angle for an arbitrary oriented surface subtended at a point is equal to the solid angle of the projection of the surface to the unit sphere with center , which can be calculated as the surface integral:

formula_6

where formula_7 is the unit vector corresponding to formula_8, the position vector of an infinitesimal area of surface with respect to point , and where formula_9 represents the unit normal vector to . Even if the projection on the unit sphere to the surface is not isomorphic, the multiple folds are correctly considered according to the surface orientation described by the sign of the scalar product formula_10.

Thus one can approximate the solid angle subtended by a small facet having flat surface area , orientation formula_11, and distance from the viewer as:

formula_12

where the surface area of a sphere is .

== Solid angles for common objects ==

=== Cone, spherical cap, hemisphere ===

The solid angle of a cone with its apex at the apex of the solid angle, and with apex angle 2, is the area of a spherical cap on a unit sphere

formula_13

For small such that this reduces to , the area of a circle.

The above is found by computing the following double integral using the unit surface element in spherical coordinates:

formula_14

This formula can also be derived without the use of calculus. 

Over 2200 years ago Archimedes proved that the surface area of a spherical cap is always equal to the area of a circle whose radius equals the distance from the rim of the spherical cap to the point where the cap&#x27;s axis of symmetry intersects the cap. In the above coloured diagram this radius is given as
formula_15
In the adjacent black &amp; white diagram this radius is given as &quot;t&quot;.

Hence for a unit sphere the solid angle of the spherical cap is given as

formula_16
When = , the spherical cap becomes a hemisphere having a solid angle 2.

The solid angle of the complement of the cone is
formula_17

This is also the solid angle of the part of the celestial sphere that an astronomical observer positioned at latitude can see as the Earth rotates. At the equator all of the celestial sphere is visible; at either pole, only one half.

The solid angle subtended by a segment of a spherical cap cut by a plane at angle from the cone&#x27;s axis and passing through the cone&#x27;s apex can be calculated by the formula

formula_18

For example, if , then the formula reduces to the spherical cap formula above: the first term becomes , and the second .

===Tetrahedron===
Let OABC be the vertices of a tetrahedron with an origin at O subtended by the triangular face ABC where formula_19 are the vector positions of the vertices A, B and C. Define the vertex angle to be the angle BOC and define , correspondingly. Let formula_20 be the dihedral angle between the planes that contain the tetrahedral faces OAC and OBC and define formula_21, formula_22 correspondingly. The solid angle subtended by the triangular surface ABC is given by

formula_23

This follows from the theory of spherical excess and it leads to the fact that there is an analogous theorem to the theorem that &quot;The sum of internal angles of a planar triangle is equal to &quot;, for the sum of the four internal solid angles of a tetrahedron as follows:

formula_24

where formula_25 ranges over all six of the dihedral angles between any two planes that contain the tetrahedral faces OAB, OAC, OBC and ABC.

A useful formula for calculating the solid angle of the tetrahedron at the origin O that is purely a function of the vertex angles , , is given by L&#x27;Huilier&#x27;s theorem as

formula_26

where
formula_27

Another interesting formula involves expressing the vertices as vectors in 3 dimensional space. Let formula_19 be the vector positions of the vertices A, B and C, and let , , and be the magnitude of each vector (the origin-point distance). The solid angle subtended by the triangular surface ABC is:

formula_29

where
formula_30

denotes the scalar triple product of the three vectors and formula_31 denotes the scalar product.

Care must be taken here to avoid negative or incorrect solid angles. One source of potential errors is that the scalar triple product can be negative if , , have the wrong winding. Computing the absolute value is a sufficient solution since no other portion of the equation depends on the winding. The other pitfall arises when the scalar triple product is positive but the divisor is negative. In this case returns a negative value that must be increased by .

===Pyramid===
The solid angle of a four-sided right rectangular pyramid with apex angles and (dihedral angles measured to the opposite side faces of the pyramid) is
formula_32

If both the side lengths ( and ) of the base of the pyramid and the distance () from the center of the base rectangle to the apex of the pyramid (the center of the sphere) are known, then the above equation can be manipulated to give

formula_33

The solid angle of a right -gonal pyramid, where the pyramid base is a regular -sided polygon of circumradius , with a 
pyramid height is

formula_34

The solid angle of an arbitrary pyramid with an -sided base defined by the sequence of unit vectors representing edges can be efficiently computed by:

formula_35

where parentheses (* *) is a scalar product and square brackets [* * *] is a scalar triple product, and is an imaginary unit. Indices are cycled: and . The complex products add the phase associated with each vertex angle of the polygon. However, a multiple of
formula_36 is lost in the branch cut of formula_37 and must be kept track of separately. Also, the running product of complex phases must scaled occasionally to avoid underflow in the limit of nearly parallel segments.

=== Latitude-longitude rectangle ===
The solid angle of a latitude-longitude rectangle on a globe is
formula_38
where and are north and south lines of latitude (measured from the equator in radians with angle increasing northward), and and are east and west lines of longitude (where the angle in radians increases eastward). Mathematically, this represents an arc of angle swept around a sphere by radians. When longitude spans 2 radians and latitude spans radians, the solid angle is that of a sphere.

A latitude-longitude rectangle should not be confused with the solid angle of a rectangular pyramid. All four sides of a rectangular pyramid intersect the sphere&#x27;s surface in great circle arcs. With a latitude-longitude rectangle, only lines of longitude are great circle arcs; lines of latitude are not.

=== Celestial objects ===
By using the definition of angular diameter, the formula for the solid angle of a celestial object can be defined in terms of the radius of the object, formula_39, and the distance from the observer to the object, formula_40:

formula_41 

By inputting the appropriate average values for the Sun and the Moon (in relation to Earth), the average solid angle of the Sun is steradians and the average solid angle of the Moon is steradians. In terms of the total celestial sphere, the Sun and the Moon subtend average &quot;fractional areas&quot; of % () and % (), respectively. As these solid angles are about the same size, the Moon can cause both total and annular solar eclipses depending on the distance between the Earth and the Moon during the eclipse.

== Solid angles in arbitrary dimensions ==
The solid angle subtended by the complete ()-dimensional spherical surface of the unit sphere in -dimensional Euclidean space can be defined in any number of dimensions . One often needs this solid angle factor in calculations with spherical symmetry. It is given by the formula
formula_42
where is the gamma function. When is an integer, the gamma function can be computed explicitly. It follows that
formula_43

This gives the expected results of 4 steradians for the 3D sphere bounded by a surface of area and 2 radians for the 2D circle bounded by a circumference of length . It also gives the slightly less obvious 2 for the 1D case, in which the origin-centered 1D &quot;sphere&quot; is the interval and this is bounded by two limiting points.

The counterpart to the vector formula in arbitrary dimension was derived by Aomoto
and independently by Ribando. It expresses them as an infinite multivariate Taylor series:
formula_44
Given unit vectors formula_45 defining the angle, let denote the matrix formed by combining them so the th column is formula_45, and formula_47. The variables formula_48 form a multivariable formula_49. For a &quot;congruent&quot; integer multiexponent formula_50 define formula_51. Note that here formula_52 = non-negative integers, or natural numbers beginning with 0. The notation formula_53 for formula_54 means the variable formula_55, similarly for the exponents formula_56. 
Hence, the term formula_57 means the sum over all terms in formula_58 in which l appears as either the first or second index.
Where this series converges, it converges to the solid angle defined by the vectors.

<text>Ricardo Bofill Leví (; 5 December 1939 – 14 January 2022) was a Spanish architect from Barcelona, Spain. He founded Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura in 1963 and developed it into a leading international architectural and urban design practice. According to architectural historian Andrew Ayers, his creations rank &quot;among the most impressive buildings of the 20th century.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Born in late 1939, just after the end of the Spanish Civil War, Ricardo Bofill grew up in a well-to-do family with deep Catalan and Barcelonese roots. His grandfather (1860-1938) had been involved in prominent local institutions such as the Institute for Catalan Studies, the , and the . His father Emilio Bofill (1907-2000) was an architect, builder, and developer who studied at &quot;&quot;, Catalonia&#x27;s oldest professional architecture school. Ricardo Bofill would later describe him as &quot;republican, liberal, progressive, austere and logical.&quot; Ricardo&#x27;s mother, Maria Levi (1909-1991), was an Italian of Jewish descent born in Venice, who became a prominent sponsor of Catalan literature and culture in post-war Barcelona. His sister Anna Bofill Leví is an architect, composer, pianist, and author.

Bofill went to school at the from 1942, the Catholic in Barcelona from 1949, then at the Lycée français de Barcelone in the 1950s. He spent much of his youth traveling, first with his family and later on his own, and developed a passion for vernacular architecture. In 1957 he enrolled at the &#x27;, where he engaged in student activism with the unauthorized Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia, and was soon arrested in a demonstration and expelled from the university and from Spain. He moved to Switzerland and enrolled at the &#x27; in 1958, which he left in 1960 to return to Spain. His first architecture design was a summer home in Ibiza, completed in 1960. In 1961-1962 he went into Spanish military service for nine months. He was again arrested and briefly incarcerated on political grounds in Barcelona in 1964.

==&quot;Taller de Arquitectura&quot;==

In 1963, Bofill and a group of close friends created Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura (Ricardo Bofill Architecture Workshop), initially hosted in his father&#x27;s construction business with offices on Plaça de Catalunya in the center of Barcelona. Building on Catalan traditions of craftsmanship, he enlisted architects and engineers but also writers and artists into a multidisciplinary effort, which later branched into urban design and urban planning. The team experimented on original methodologies based on three-dimensional modular geometries, such as those of the in Reus (1964-1970), &quot;El Castillo de Kafka&quot; in Sant Pere de Ribes above Sitges (1964-1968), &quot;Xanadu&quot; (1966-1971), and &quot;La Muralla Roja&quot; (1968-1973) in Calp. The same thinking was developed on a larger scale with the project &quot;La Ciudad en el Espacio&quot; (&quot;The City in Space&quot;), whose construction started in the Moratalaz area of Madrid in 1970 but was abruptly stopped by Francoist mayor Carlos Arias Navarro. It was instead realized with the construction of Walden 7 in Sant Just Desvern near Barcelona (1970-1975). These projects were recognized as exemplars of critical regionalism and can be viewed as a reaction against both architectural modernism and the Francoist dictatorship in Spain.

Bofill then started working in France, and gradually introduced symbolic elements into the &quot;Tallers designs that echo French traditions of classical architecture. In 1971, he was invited by , a key planner of the Cergy-Pontoise urban project, to develop a design concept analogous to that of the in Reus. This morphed into a project named &quot;La Petite Cathédrale&quot; (&quot;the small cathedral&quot;) but actually intended as a large-scale development, which was approved in 1973 but canceled in 1974. Another major development was a competition-winning concept for Les Halles in Paris in 1975, whose construction subsequently started but was reversed in 1978 by the newly elected mayor Jacques Chirac. Other projects did come to fruition in the &#x27; around Paris which offered a favorable environment for large-scale experimentation, including &quot;Les Espaces d&#x27;Abraxas&quot; in Marne-la-Vallée and &quot;Les Arcades du Lac&quot; in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines. This phase culminated in the expansive Antigone new district of Montpellier in Southern France, for which Bofill presented the initial master plan in 1978. It is associated with both large-scale industrialization in precast concrete and classical forms and geometries in contemporary architecture, which Bofill called &quot;modern classicism&quot;. As a consequence, Bofill opus is often cited as that one of the most representative and signififant postmodern architects to have lived and created in Europe.

From the mid-1980s on, he increasingly shifted to glass and steel for the materials used in his projects, while still using a classical vocabulary of columns and pediments. Representative projects of that period include the 77 West Wacker Drive office tower in Chicago, the extension of Barcelona Airport ahead of the 1992 Summer Olympics, and the National Theater of Catalonia, also in Barcelona.

In 2000, Bofill re-centralized the activities of the &quot;Taller&quot; at its head office near Barcelona. His designs in more recent years gradually shed his classical decorative vocabulary of the 1980s and 1990s, while retaining a highly formal sense of geometry. Representative buildings of this more recent period include the W Barcelona Hotel on the Barcelona seafront and the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in Ben Guerir, Morocco.

==Personal life and death==

Bofill met Italian actress Serena Vergano in 1962; their son Ricardo Emilio Bofill was born in 1965. Bofill and French visual artist Annabelle d&#x27;Huart had another son, Pablo Bofill, born in 1980. Both sons eventually worked with their father at Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura, and are co-leading the firm as of January 2022. From the 1990s, Bofill lived in Barcelona together with Catalan designer Marta de Vilallonga. In October 2021, he was named in the Pandora Papers.

He died from complications linked to COVID-19 in Barcelona on , at the age of 82.

<doc id="94105" wikidata="Q124308" url="?curid=94105" title="Holloway, London">
<text>Holloway is an area of north London in the London Borough of Islington, England, north of Charing Cross, which follows the line of the Holloway Road (A1). At the centre of Holloway is the Nag&#x27;s Head commercial area which sits between the more residential Upper Holloway and Lower Holloway neighbourhoods. Holloway has a multicultural population and includes the Emirates Stadium, home of Arsenal F.C. Until 2016, it was the site of Holloway Prison, the largest women&#x27;s prison in Europe. Before 1965, it was in the historic county of Middlesex.

==History==
The origins of the name are disputed; some believe that it derives from &quot;Hollow&quot;, or &quot;Hollow way&quot;, due to a dip in the road caused by the passage of animals and water erosion, as this was the main cattle driving route from the North into Smithfield. In Lower Holloway the former &quot;Back Road&quot;, now Liverpool Road was used to rest and graze the cattle before entering London. Others believe the name derives from &quot;Hallow&quot; and refers to the road&#x27;s historic significance as part of the pilgrimage route to Walsingham. No documentary evidence can be found to support either derivation; and by 1307, the name &quot;Holwey&quot; was applied to the district around the road. The main stretch of Holloway Road runs through the site of the former villages of Tollington and Stroud. The exact time of their founding is not known, but the earliest record of them is in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;. The names had ceased being used by the late 17th century, but are still preserved in the local place names of Tollington Park and Stroud Green.

The original route from London went through Tollington Lane. By the 14th century it was in such poor condition that the Bishop of London built a new road up Highgate Hill and was claiming tolls by 1318. This was the origin of the Great North Road, now the A1, which passes through Holloway.

Until the 18th century, the area was predominantly rural, but as London expanded in the second half of the 19th century it became urbanised. Holloway, like much of inner north London, experienced further rapid growth in the early 1900s. It became an important local shopping centre, benefitting from the road junction at Nag&#x27;s Head which became an important hub for trolleybuses till their withdrawal in the 1950s. The London and North Eastern Railway opened a station here, which had a significant impact on the residential and commercial development of the neighbourhood in the latter part of the 19th century. The station, now closed, was at the same spot as the current Holloway Road tube station, on the Piccadilly line.

In 1921, the first sexual health clinic for women in the whole of the UK was opened in Holloway by Marie Stopes. The Mothers&#x27; Clinic at 61 Marlborough Road, Holloway, North London, opened on 17 March 1921. The clinic was run by midwives and supported by visiting doctors. It offered mothers birth control advice, taught them birth control methods and dispensed Stopes own &quot;Pro-Race&quot; brand cervical cap.
The free clinic was open to all married women for knowledge about reproductive health. Stopes opposed abortion; she tried to discover alternatives for families and increase knowledge about birth control and the reproductive system.

In the late 1930s, the Odeon cinema on the junction of Tufnell Park Road and Holloway Road was built as a Gaumont but was severely damaged by a doodlebug during the Second World War. It has recently undergone extensive refurbishment but retains its foyer and staircase. It is Grade II listed.

During the Second World War, parts of Holloway experienced intense bombing due to its proximity to King&#x27;s Cross railway station.

Holloway was also home to HMP Holloway in Parkhurst Road, which was first built in 1852, originally housing both male and female prisoners, and from 1902 until its closure in 2016 housed only women and was the UK&#x27;s major female prison. Prisoners that had been held at the original prison include Ruth Ellis, Isabella Glyn, Christabel Pankhurst and Oscar Wilde. The site is due to be redeveloped, though as of 2017 the prison buildings still stand.

==Holloway as of 2021==

Like many other parts of Islington, the gentrification of Holloway is now under way, particularly in the Hillmarton and Mercers Road/Tavistock Terrace conservation areas (to the south and west of Holloway Road). There are also many luxury development projects taking place over a large area between the Arsenal stadium development and Caledonian Road. In addition, Islington London Borough Council have earmarked many improvement projects for the Nag&#x27;s Head area over the next decade. It is also home to the large, sprawling Andover housing estate.

Near to Holloway Road tube station is the North Campus of London Metropolitan University. This includes the Tower building, Stapleton House and the Learning Centre. Another prominent feature in Holloway is the Emirates Stadium, home of Arsenal F.C.

The area is home to many artists and people who work in the media, including many journalists, writers and professionals working in film and television. It is also known as a hotspot for many of London&#x27;s graffiti artists.

==Demographics==
At the 2001 census, the population of Holloway was 41,329, of those 48% male and 52% female. It is home to a very multicultural population, with the Holloway ward in 2011 recorded as: 42% white British, 21% from other white backgrounds, 7% mixed race, 14% Black, and 11% Asian. The mixed race population is in the top 100 out of 8,500 wards in the country. It is one of the most densely populated areas of London, with a density of approximately 40,000 people per square mile.

==Ashburton Grove==
Arsenal Football Club moved after 93 years at Highbury to a new stadium at Ashburton Grove in Holloway. It was informally known as Ashburton Grove until a naming rights deal with Emirates was announced. The stadium opened in the summer of 2006, and has an all-seated capacity of 60,355, making it the third biggest stadium in the Premiership after Old Trafford and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and the fourth biggest in London after Wembley Stadium, Twickenham Stadium and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The overall cost of the project was £390 million.

Ashburton Grove was the site of Islington&#x27;s Waste Transfer station. This facility has been moved to nearby Hornsey Street. All of Islington&#x27;s waste is shipped here for onward processing - together with a significant proportion of that generated by the neighbouring London Boroughs of Camden and Hackney. The waste is transported by road to the Edmonton Solid Waste Incineration Plant or to landfill sites in Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire.

==Transport==

The nearest London Underground stations are Caledonian Road, Highbury &amp; Islington, Holloway Road and Archway.

<text>Golders Green Crematorium and Mausoleum was the first crematorium to be opened in London, and one of the oldest crematoria in Britain. The land for the crematorium was purchased in 1900, costing £6,000 (the equivalent of £136,000 in 2021), and the crematorium was opened in 1902 by Sir Henry Thompson.

Golders Green Crematorium, as it is usually called, is in Hoop Lane, off Finchley Road, Golders Green, in northwest London, near Golders Green Underground station. It is directly opposite the Golders Green Jewish Cemetery. (Golders Green is an area with a large Jewish population.) The crematorium is secular, accepts all faiths and non-believers; clients may arrange their own type of service or remembrance event and choose whatever music they wish.

The crematorium gardens are listed at Grade I in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

==History==

The legality of cremation in Great Britain was not confirmed until 1885. The first crematorium was built in Woking and it was successful. At that time cremation was championed by the Cremation Society of Great Britain. This society was governed by a council, at that time led by Sir Henry Thompson (president and founding member). There is a bust to his memory in the West Chapel of Golders Green Crematorium. Out of this Society was formed the London Cremation Company (which has its offices on the premises), who desired to build a crematorium within easy reach of London.

The crematorium in Golders Green was designed by the architect Sir Ernest George and his partner Alfred Yeates. The gardens were laid out by William Robinson. The crematorium is a red brick building in Lombardic style and was built in stages, as money became available. The crematorium opened in 1902 and was built in four phases (1901–1910, 1910–1911, 1912–1916, 1926–1928). By 1939, the site was largely completed, although since then some buildings have been added. Since November 1902 more than 323,500 cremations have taken place at Golders Green Crematorium, far more than any other British crematorium. It is estimated that the crematorium now averages around 2,000 cremations a year. The funerals of many prominent people have taken place there over the last century.
The chimney of the crematorium is located within the tower and the building is in an Italianate style. The of gardens are extensively planted, and produce a beautiful and tranquil environment for visitors. There are several large tombs, two ponds and bridge, and a large crocus lawn. Another notable feature is a special children&#x27;s section, which includes a swinging bench. There is also a &#x27;communist corner&#x27; with memorials to notables of the Communist Party of Great Britain. There are two cremation chapels and a Chapel of Memory. There are also three columbaria containing the ashes of thousands of Londoners and residents of neighbouring counties.

There have been 14 holders of the Victoria Cross cremated here, and there are locations and memorials for many other military personnel of all ranks, and from many countries. Largest among them is the Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorial, commemorating 496 British and Commonwealth military casualties of both World Wars who were cremated here. Designed by Sir Edward Maufe, it was unveiled in 1952. Built in Portland stone with names listed on three bronze panels, it stands at head of an ornamental pond at the western end of the memorial cloister.

At Christmas, a Christmas tree is erected in the field in front of the main buildings. Although the crematorium is secular, a nativity scene is also placed near the Chapel of Memory.
==Notable monuments==
The crematorium gardens are listed at Grade I in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The Philipson Family mausoleum, designed by Edwin Lutyens, is a Grade II* listed building on the National Heritage List for England and the crematorium building, the wall, along with memorials and gates, the Martin Smith Mausoleum and &quot;Into The Silent Land&quot;, a sculpture by Henry Alfred Pegram are all Grade II listed buildings. The largest sculpture portraying someone cremated here is the statue of Indian industrialist and friend of Gandhi, Ghanshyam Das Birla.

==Visiting==
A map of the Garden of Rest and some information on persons cremated here is available from the office. Staff are available to help in finding a specific location.

<text>Homerton ( ) is an area in London, England, in the London Borough of Hackney. It is bordered to the west by Hackney Central, to the north by Lower Clapton, in the east by Hackney Wick, Leyton and by South Hackney to the south. In 2019, it had a population of 14,658 people. In terms of ethnicity it was 43.9% White, 33.0% Black, 10.9% Asian and 7.8% Mixed. It covered an area of 0.830 sq kilometres. Homerton ward on Hackney Borough Council is currently represented by three Labour councillors. There are fifty listed buildings located within the boundaries of the ward.

==History==

===Origins===
Archaeological excavations at Link Street exposed a building dating to the 11th or 12th century suggesting that Homerton existed before it was first recorded in 1343. The hamlet of Homerton (Humberton or Hummerton, named for the farm of a woman named Hunburh) developed for about a half-mile along the road on the north side of the now buried and lost Hackney Brook, within the vale formed by the brook. This led from the hamlet of Clopton, passing near the church of St Augustine at Hackney, then across the marshes and the crossing points of both the River Lea, and its tributary, Hackney Brook. By 1605 Homerton was the most populous part of the Parish of Hackney, becoming a separate parish in 1846.

===Medieval Homerton===
In medieval times, Homerton, like much of Hackney, was predominantly rural and arable crops were grown, together with fruit and vegetables for the City of London markets. The majority of the land was given over to pasture for sheep and cattle, and milk and cheese were also supplied to the city. Small kitchen gardens ran at the back of the houses along the road, with large fields behind. Domestic brewing was common (there are records of brewing performed at Sutton House and the Tan House). Many unsavoury activities (banned in the city) were also undertaken, such as tanning and fulling - the cleaning of felt cloth using urine.

===Tudor wealth===

Homerton became a desirable suburb of London in the Tudor period, with many estates and grand houses being formed from the former Templar lands (Knights Templar of St. John of Jerusalem). The village was divided between Upper and Lower Homerton, with the later extending towards the marshes and the house at Hackney Wick. Upper Homerton was divided from the village of Hackney by the width of the rectory manor&#x27;s Church Field, and a path led to the churchyard. In 1538, this estate, including other fields lying along the brook, passed to the Tudor diplomat Sir Ralph Sadler. Around 1560 part of this estate came into the ownership of Thomas Sutton, a resident of the Tan House (adjacent to Sutton House). This land formed part of his endowment of the Hospital of King James in Charterhouse, who continued to own the property until the 20th century, building Sutton Place between 1790 and 1806.

===The marshes===

Marsh Road, from Homerton High Street, led to, and across the marshes, towards the Templar owned water-powered corn mill at Temple Mills. Prone to flooding, the marshes were primarily used for grazing. A Roman stone causeway was discovered in the 1770s.

By 1795 the former Templar mills were being used for preparing lead. Sheets of lead were placed in clay pots and submerged in urine, then heated by decaying cow dung. The process converted the lead to lead oxide, and it was then finely ground to form a pigment for white, yellow and red lead paint. A new watermill was established on the marshes by Prince Rupert for an improved method of boring guns; however, the secret died with him in 1682, and the enterprise collapsed.

===Religion and education===

In the 18th century the availability of land, large houses and tolerance to dissenters made Homerton a popular place to found institutions. The educational ones were commonly known as Dissenting Academies. The Kings Head Society moved to a large house here in 1768, forming Homerton College for the education of Calvinist ministers with between 12 and 20 students. Religious education moved to the new University College London in 1826, but Homerton College remained here as a teacher training college until 1896 when it moved to Cambridge, eventually becoming a full college of the University of Cambridge in 2010. Students from Homerton college were principal in forming, in 1881, both the Glynn Cricket Club and Clapton Orient - which became Leyton Orient F.C. on its move to Leyton. The buildings of the college were rebuilt and expanded several times, but eventually lost to bomb damage in World War II.
South of the Brook, by Money Lane, the Unitarian Gravel Pit Meeting House was built between 1715 and 1716. This was the result of an acrimonious split in the congregation of the Lower Clapton meeting. Notable nonconformist ministers preached at the Old Gravel Pit. The moral and political philosopher Richard Price, known for his support of the American Revolution, became morning preacher in 1770, while continuing his afternoon sermons at Newington Green Chapel, on the green where he lived. Those who attended his sermons in Homerton included American politicians such as John Adams, who later became the second president of the United States, and his wife Abigail. On the 101st anniversary of the Glorious Revolution, he preached a sermon at Old Jewry meeting house entitled &quot;A Discourse on the Love of Our Country&quot;, thus igniting a so-called &quot;pamphlet war&quot; known as the Revolution Controversy, furiously debating the issues raised by the French Revolution. Burke&#x27;s rebuttal &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; attacked Price, whose friends Thomas Paine and Mary Wollstonecraft leapt into the fray to defend their mentor. The reputation of Price for speaking without fear of the government on these political and philosophical matters drew huge crowds to his sermons, which were published and sold as pamphlets (i.e. publications easily printed and circulated). Another eminent minister was the formidable polymath, Joseph Priestley, discoverer of oxygen. When his support of dissent led to the riots named after him, he fled Birmingham and headed for London; he was appointed minister here in 1793. Today a Blue Plaque marks the site of the Gravel Pit Meeting House in Ram Place and a brown plaque marks the site of the Priestley&#x27;s house at 113 Lower Clapton Road (on the corner of Clapton Passage). Priestley said of his time here, &quot;On the whole I spent my life more happily at Hackney than I had ever done before&quot;. The meeting house is now used as a factory.

===Victorian era===

A spur connecting the North London Railway at Dalston to Stratford, forming a part of the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway, opened in 1847 for the carriage of coal. This resulted in Hackney Brook being placed in a culvert and the loss of the extensive watercress fields to the south of Homerton High Street. Its later development as a passenger line led to the redevelopment in the 1880s of the mediaeval core of the village on Homerton High Street with Victorian dwellings and public houses, and speculative building on the lands either side of Homerton High Street. In 1868 Homerton Station opened.

The parish church of St Barnabas on Homerton High Street, designed by Hackney-born Arthur Ashpitel, was built between 1843 and 1852, of Kentish ragstone, with a grant from the Incorporated Church Building Society and its endowment and vicarage funded by Joshua Watson. Described by Nikolaus Pevsner as &quot;interesting as an effort to copy local character&quot;, it is built in the perpendicular style and was Grade II listed in 1975. Having been damaged by bombing during 1944, it was restored after World War Two and rededicated in 1958. At the time of the church&#x27;s construction, the area was described as being inhabited by a &quot;very poor class of labourers &amp; those who trust to precarious employment&quot;.

The church of St Luke, Chatham Place, consecrated in 1872, is situated in the south of the Homerton area. It was designed by Arthur Shean Newman and Arthur Billing in a gothic revival style, and is Grade II listed. Construction of the Grade II listed red brick church of St Paul, Lower Homerton on Glyn Road, was completed in 1891. It was designed in combination of Arts and Crafts and Early English styles, by Henry Cowell Boyes, the architect of the Worshipful Company of Grocers, which also operated a school in the area, with its foundation stone being laid by the livery company&#x27;s Master. It was declared redundant, first being used by the Celestial Church of Christ before being taken over by a Seventh-Day Adventist congregation in 2006. The Roman Catholic church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary on Kenworthy Road, designed by C.A. Buckler and inspired by the churches of Sta Maria in Dominica and Santi Nereo e Achillo was completed in 1883, and rebuilt after damage in World War Two.

In the early 1890s, the author of &quot;Glimpses of Ancient Hackney&quot; wrote: &quot;Few who traverse Homerton today will fail to note the squalid poverty of many of its inhabitants, the mean tumble-down dwellings, for which we have to thank the jerry-builders, who doubtless will pass the odium on to the ground landlords&quot;.

By the 1860s, London fell prey to epidemics of fever. The 200 bed Eastern Fever Hospital was founded in September 1870 by the Metropolitan Asylums Board to prevent contagion. There were six wards for typhus, two each for scarlet fever and enteric patients. Two smaller wards were reserved for &#x27;special cases&#x27;. The buildings were almost entirely demolished in 1982 and the site became the core of the modern Homerton University Hospital, which opened in 1986. This replaced the old Hackney Hospital which (in turn) had been formed from the Hackney Union Workhouse. These buildings are now used by the Hackney Mental Health Trust.

===Industry and housing===

The coming of the railways and the building of the fever hospital drove many of the wealthier residents away. The tightly packed Victorian streets provided homes for the clerks and employees of the new purpose-built factories (like Berger Paints) being built in the area. From 1937 onwards, the London County Council built mass housing, sweeping away the worst of the slums, but also eliminating many older buildings containing shops on Homerton High Street, effectively destroying it as a commercial area. The Lesney die cast model factory was built in the 1940s on the Homerton side of the Lee Navigation, just north of Homerton Road, producing for many years their &quot;Matchbox&quot; brand. The factory closed in 1990 and was demolished in 2010.

The oldest surviving residential building in Hackney is Sutton House on Homerton High Street. It was built in 1535 and is owned and run by the National Trust.

===In modern times===

1970s glam rock singer Marc Bolan and actor Ray Winstone were born in Hackney Hospital, on Homerton High Street. The hospital, originally built in 1841 as the Hackney Union workhouse, finally closed in 1995. The old hospital was refurbished in 2006 and reopened to serve the mental health trust.

Homerton&#x27;s links with popular music continued with the arrival of Toe Rag Studios, relocated from Shoreditch to the Lower Clapton/Homerton border, an eight-track recording studio which uses reclaimed 1960s analogue equipment, where the White Stripes&#x27; acclaimed 2003 album &quot;Elephant&quot; was produced. More recently, Sound Savers studios was also established in Homerton, and Gun Factory Studios relocated to the area from Stoke Newington. UK drill artist Unknown T is from Homerton.
Homerton is also home to Chats Palace arts centre, named after the nearby Chatsworth Road. Chats Palace has presented and encouraged a wide variety of music, comedy, theatre, photography, carnival, disability arts, dance and transgressive performance, including Clifford Jarvis, Tom Hunter, Miniscule of Sound, Red Saunders, Asian Dub Foundation and Graeae Theatre Company. The building itself was originally established as a Carnegie library, built in 1912–13 for the betterment of the people of the East End. The council closed the library in 1976 but members of the local community reclaimed the building. In October 2014, historic pub the Chesham Arms on Mehetabel Road became Hackney&#x27;s first Asset of Community Value.

Homerton is home to the Castle Cinema, which re-opened following a successful Kickstarter campaign raised £57,000 to support its renovation in 2016.

==Education==

Secondary schools located in the area include Cardinal Pole Catholic School and the City Academy, Hackney.

==Transport==
===Rail===
Homerton is served by London Overground at Homerton railway station, with westbound trains to Richmond and Clapham Junction via Dalston Junction, and eastbound trains to Stratford. The original station was opened on 1 October 1868. Services ceased on 15 May 1944 with a substitute bus service provided until official closure on 23 April 1945. Other than a partial section of wall to the north of the bridge over Barnabas Road, the original 1868 station has been demolished. Although of reduced size, the original station building would have been similar to buildings remaining at Hackney Central and Camden Road. The present basic station was opened on 13 May 1985.

===Buses===
Homerton is served by a large number of London Buses routes 26, 30, 236, 242, 276, 308, 388, 394, 425 and 488 as well as the W15. Homerton is also served by the London night bus network by route N26 and N242.

<text>Hornchurch is a suburban town in East London in the London Borough of Havering and predominantly an affluent residential area. It is located east-northeast of Charing Cross. It comprises a number of shopping streets and a large residential area. It historically formed a large ancient parish in the county of Essex that became the manor and liberty of Havering. The economic history of Hornchurch is underpinned by a shift away from agriculture to other industries with the growing significance of nearby Romford as a market town and centre of administration. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Hornchurch significantly expanded and increased in population, becoming an urban district in 1926 and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. It is the location of Queen&#x27;s Theatre, Havering Sixth Form College and Havering College of Further and Higher Education.

==History==
===Toponymy===

According to Mills, Hornchurch is first recorded in English in 1233 as &quot;Hornechurch&quot; and means &#x27;church with horn-like gables&#x27;. It has been suggested that the Hornchurch Priory is the origin of the Hornchurch placename because the priory used a bulls-head seal on official documents during the 14th century. Both the seal and, since , the bull emblem on the wall of the parish church derive from the name rather than provide the origin.

===Origins===
In the Anglian Ice Age, 450,000 years ago, the ice sheet reached The Dell, just south of St Andrew&#x27;s Church, the furthest south any ice sheet reached in Britain. Hornchurch Cutting is a Site of Special Scientific Interest just north of St Andrews Park which exhibits the geology. Stone Age tools, Bronze Age and Iron Age artefacts have been discovered in Hornchurch, indicating a lengthy occupation in pre-history. Roman remains, sufficient to indicate a settlement have also been found in South Hornchurch.

===Hornchurch Priory and New College===
In 1158/9 Henry II gave of southern Hornchurch to the hospice of Great St Bernard Hospice in Savoy as a gift. The Hornchurch Priory was established and in 1163 the St Andrew&#x27;s Church and adjacent land was given by Henry II to the priory with a house built to the north of the church. The priory lands in total were around . The priory claimed exclusive spiritual authority within the ancient parish of Hornchurch which was the same area as the manor of Havering at this time. The Parliament of England authorised the king to confiscate the property of alien religious houses that supported the Avignon Papacy in 1379. The members of the priory left the house in 1385 and the property was seized. The lands were purchased in 1391 by William of Wykeham for the endowment of New College, Oxford. The site of the priory became Hornchurch Hall.

===Economic development===
The Hornchurch Marsh was used for cattle grazing and became popular with butchers, inn owners and others in the City of London and by the 19th century it had become famous for the quality of the cattle sent to the London meat market. Havering was a centre of leather production from the 13th to 16th centuries. The high street was known as Street, reflecting the importance of the leather trade in Hornchurch. There was a brewery in Hornchurch from 1789 to 1929. The Speedwell (later renamed Ormonde) cycle factory was located on Hornchurch Road from around 1879 to 1900. It employed 100 &quot;men and boys&quot; in 1897. Stafford Allen and Sons set up a chemical factory in Ardleigh Green, adjacent to the railway tracks, after their first choice of a nearby site in Gidea Park was rejected in 1919. Lacrinoid Products took over the site in 1936 for a plastics factory.

===Local government===

Hornchurch was a large ancient parish in the Becontree hundred of Essex; it was divided into the three chapelries of Havering-atte-Bower, Hornchurch and Romford. The Hornchurch chapelry stretched from the River Thames in the south to Harold Wood in the north and was located between the River Ingrebourne in the east and the River Beam in the west. It was also known as &#x27;Hornchurch side&#x27; and consisted of the North End, South End and Town wards. Town ward was absorbed into North End and South End around 1722. Hornchurch chapelry occupied of the ancient parish. The local authority was the Hornchurch vestry. The royal manor of Havering, which was conterminous with the ancient parish of Hornchurch, enjoyed special status and a charter in 1465 removed it from the Becontree hundred and the county of Essex to instead form an independent liberty. By the 16th century &#x27;Romford side&#x27;, comprising the five northern wards of Romford Town, Harold Wood, Collier Row, Noak Hill and Havering, had grown larger than Hornchurch and had achieved some degree of independence from the Hornchurch vestry. Havering ward grew independent in its own right and became a separate parish in the late 18th century.

Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Hornchurch and Romford became separate civil parishes in 1836 and were grouped into the Romford Poor Law Union. The area of the union, excluding the town of Romford, became a rural sanitary district in 1875. The special status of the Liberty of Havering was abolished in 1892 and the area was reincorporated into Essex. In 1894 the Hornchurch vestry was replaced by Hornchurch Parish Council. The rural sanitary district became Romford Rural District and the local authority became Romford Rural District Council. As the population of Hornchurch was rising, the parish council was abolished in 1926 and the parish was removed from the rural district. On 1 April 1926 the parish of Hornchurch became Hornchurch Urban District and the local authority became Hornchurch Urban District Council, with the first election having taken place on 27 March 1926. The council met at Langtons House from 1929. The urban district was significantly expanded in 1934 when the parishes of Cranham, Rainham, Upminster, Wennington and part of Great Warley were added. In 1936 part of North Ockendon was added to the district. The area formed part of the London Traffic Area from 1924 and the London Passenger Transport Area from 1933. The whole area was included in the London Borough of Havering in 1965 and it was transferred from Essex to Greater London. For elections to the Greater London Council, Hornchurch was part of the Havering electoral division until 1973 and then the Hornchurch electoral division until 1986.

===Suburban expansion===
Railway stations opened in the parish of Hornchurch at Harold Wood in 1868 and Hornchurch in 1885. Both stations were some distance from the village and did not initially encourage large scale housebuilding.

In 1886 the parish authorities of St Leondard Shoreditch purchased 80 acres of Harrow Lodge Farm for the construction of the Hornchurch cottage homes that opened in 1889. The homes had a population of 306 in 1896. In 1897 Hornchurch had a population of 4,200. It was a large village with scattered groups of houses throughout rest the parish and in the northwest the built up area of Romford extended into it. The growth of Hornchurch from rural village to suburban town began with the sale of the southern of Nelmes manor for the Emerson Park housing estate of 200 homes in 1895. In 1901 the northern portion of Nelmes was sold for the Great Nelmes housing estate. Emerson Park railway station was opened in 1909 to serve the new estates.

Uphavering Terrace, the first 18 council houses in Hornchurch, were constructed on Abbs Cross Lane in 1914 by Romford Rural District Council at the request of Hornchurch Parish Council. 50 houses at Princes Park and 48 at Priors Park were constructed in the early 1920s by the Romford Rural District Council following the Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c. Act 1919 as &quot;housing of the working classes&quot;. In total, 186 houses were built by 1922. 60 further houses were built by Hornchurch Urban District Council on Suttons Avenue and Park Lane from 1928.

The construction of the dual carriageways of the Southend Arterial Road between 1925 and 1940 cut off the Harold Wood part of the parish from the rest.

Hornchurch was quickly built upon as part of the interwar private housing boom that saw workers migrate from the inner districts of London. This was encouraged by the introduction of the electric District Railway service from 1932 and the availability of cheap agricultural land for development. The population of Hornchurch grew by 335% from 1921 to 1938 as new homes were occupied. 50 acres of Haynes Park Farm was sold in 1925 for development as the Haynes Park building estate. The New College lands were sold for development between 1927 and 1931. The density of interwar development was much higher than the Emerson Park and Great Nelmes estates. In 1930 the development of the Wych Elm Farm estate caused an arbitration case which only partially upheld the restrictive covenant on the size of houses that could be built. Grey Towers mansion was demolished in 1931 and the grounds used for the Grey Towers housing estate and the Towers Cinema. Stafford Allen and Sons built houses for factory employees along Stafford Avenue around 1931.

In 1931 Hornchurch Hall, Priors Farm and Grove Farm were being developed for housing and the Crescent and Ravenscourt estates were being built. In 1932 the Hardley Green, Harold Wood Hall, Lee Gardens and Redden Court estates were being built. In 1933 an extension to the Hardley Green estate was under construction and work on the Maylands, Dorset House and Hornford estates was underway. Wyebridge, Elm and Uphavering farms were purchased in 1933 by Richard Costain and Sons for the Elm Park Garden City development. 7,000 houses were planned with the official opening of the estate in 1935. This coincided with the opening of Elm Park tube station and Harrow Lodge Park. Elm Park had a higher density of development than previous schemes and had its own town centre. 2,600 houses were built by 1939 with further development halted by the Second World War. After the war, the estate was completed with over 1,000 council houses.

Nelmes manor house and immediate grounds survived until 1967 when the house was demolished by the owner to avoid a preservation order by the Greater London Council. The land was used for The Witherings neo-Georgian style housing development.

===Hornchurch Airfield and the military===
During both the First World War and Second World War nearby Hornchurch Airfield was an important RAF station; it was known as RAF Suttons Farm during the Great War, with its HQ as far away as Upminster Hall. During the Second World War, the airfield was known as RAF Hornchurch, and was home mostly to a number of Spitfire squadrons, with an advanced sub-station at Rayleigh. The land has since been reused for a large housing development and Hornchurch Country Park. During the First World War a large vacant country estate called Grey Towers on Hornchurch Road was commandeered by the Army Council as a military depot. In January 1916 it became the first Command Depot for the New Zealand Contingent in Britain but was found to be more suitable as a Convalescent Hospital Camp for servicemen from the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, and was run as such until June 1919.

<doc id="94111" wikidata="Q44228" url="?curid=94111" title="Leonidas I">
<text>Leonidas I (; , &quot;Leōnídas&quot;; born ; died 11 August 480 BC) was king of the Ancient Greek city-state of Sparta. He was the son of king Anaxandridas II and the 17th king of the Agiad dynasty, a Spartan royal house which claimed descent from the mythical demigod Heracles. Leonidas I ascended to the throne in , succeeding his half-brother king Cleomenes I. He ruled jointly along with king Leotychidas until his death in 480 BC, when he was succeeded by his son, Pleistarchus. 

At the Second Greco-Persian War, Leonidas led the allied Greek forces in a last stand at the Battle of Thermopylae (480 BC), attempting to defend the pass from the invading Persian army, and was killed early during the third and last day of the battle. Leonidas entered myth as a hero and the leader of the 300 Spartans who died in battle at Thermopylae. While the Greeks lost this battle, they were able to expel the Persian invaders in the following year.

==Life==
According to Herodotus, Leonidas&#x27; mother was not only his father&#x27;s wife, but also his father&#x27;s niece and had been barren for so long that the ephors, the five annually elected administrators of the Spartan constitution, tried to prevail upon King Anaxandridas II to set her aside and take another wife. Anaxandridas refused, claiming his wife was blameless, whereupon the ephors agreed to allow him to take a second wife without setting aside his first. This second wife, a descendant of Chilon of Sparta (one of the Seven Sages of Greece), promptly bore a son, Cleomenes. However, one year after Cleomenes&#x27; birth, Anaxandridas&#x27; first wife also gave birth to a son, Dorieus. Leonidas was the second son of Anaxandridas&#x27; first wife, and either the elder brother or twin of Cleombrotus. Leonidas&#x27; name means &quot;descendant of Leon&quot;, and he was named after his grandfather Leon of Sparta. The Doric Greek suffix -ίδας, with corresponding Attic form -ίδης, mainly means &quot;descendant of&quot;. But literally his name can also mean &quot;son of a lion&quot;, as the name Leon means &quot;lion&quot; in Greek.

King Anaxandridas II died in c. 524 BC, and Cleomenes succeeded to the throne sometime between then and 516 BC. Dorieus was so outraged that the Spartans had preferred his half-brother over himself that he found it impossible to remain in Sparta. He made one unsuccessful attempt to set up a colony in Africa and, when this failed, sought his fortune in Sicily, where after initial successes he was killed. Leonidas&#x27; relationship with his bitterly antagonistic elder brothers is unknown, but he married Cleomenes&#x27; daughter, Gorgo, sometime before coming to the throne in 490 BC.

Leonidas was heir to the Agiad throne (successor of Cleomenes I) and a full citizen (&quot;homoios&quot;) at the time of the Battle of Sepeia against Argos (c. 494 BC). Likewise, he was a full citizen when the Persians sought submission from Sparta and met with vehement rejection in 492/491 BC. His elder half-brother, king Cleomenes, had already been deposed on grounds of purported insanity, and had fled into exile when Athens sought assistance against the First Persian invasion of Greece, that ended at Marathon (490 BC).

Plutarch wrote, “When someone said to him: &#x27;Except for being king you are not at all superior to us,&#x27; Leonidas son of Anaxandridas and brother of Cleomenes replied: &#x27;But were I not better than you, I should not be king.&#x27;&quot; The product of the &quot;agoge&quot;, Leonidas was unlikely to have been referring to his royal blood alone but rather suggesting that, like his brother Dorieus, he had proved himself superior in the competitive environment of Spartan training and society, thus making him qualified to rule.

Leonidas was chosen to lead the combined Greek forces determined to resist the Second Persian invasion of Greece in 481 BC. This was not simply a tribute to Sparta&#x27;s military prowess: The probability that the coalition wanted Leonidas personally for his capability as a military leader is underlined by the fact that just two years after his death, the coalition preferred Athenian leadership to the leadership of either Leotychidas or Leonidas&#x27; successor (as regent for his still under-aged son) Pausanias. The rejection of Leotychidas and Pausanias was not a reflection on Spartan arms. Sparta&#x27;s military reputation had never stood in higher regard, nor was Sparta less powerful in 478 BC than it had been in 481 BC.

This selection of Leonidas to lead the defence of Greece against Xerxes&#x27; invasion led to Leonidas&#x27; death in the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC.

===Battle of Thermopylae===
Upon receiving a request from the confederated Greek forces to aid in defending Greece against the Persian invasion, Sparta consulted the Oracle at Delphi. The Oracle is said to have made the following prophecy in hexameter verse:

In August 480 BC, Leonidas marched out of Sparta to meet Xerxes&#x27; army at Thermopylae with a small force of 1,200 men (900 helots and 300 Spartan hoplites), where he was joined by forces from other Greek city-states, who put themselves under his command to form an army of 7,000 strong. There are various theories on why Leonidas was accompanied by such a small force of hoplites. According to Herodotus, &quot;the Spartans sent the men with Leonidas on ahead so that the rest of the allies would see them and march with no fear of defeat, instead of siding with the Persians like the others if they learned that the Spartans were delaying. After completing their festival, the Carneia, they left their garrison at Sparta and marched in full force towards Thermopylae. The rest of the allies planned to do likewise, for the Olympiad coincided with these events. They accordingly sent their advance guard, not expecting the war at Thermopylae to be decided so quickly.&quot; Many modern commentators are dissatisfied with this explanation and point to the fact that the Olympic Games were in progress or impute internal dissent and intrigue.

Whatever the reason Sparta&#x27;s own contribution was just 300 Spartiates (accompanied by their attendants and probably perioikoi auxiliaries), the total force assembled for the defence of the pass of Thermopylae came to something between four and seven thousand Greeks. They faced a Persian army who had invaded from the north of Greece under Xerxes I. Herodotus stated that this army consisted of over two million men; modern scholars consider this to be an exaggeration and give estimates ranging from 70,000 to 300,000.
Xerxes waited four days to attack, hoping the Greeks would disperse. Finally, on the fifth day the Persians attacked. Leonidas and the Greeks repulsed the Persians&#x27; frontal attacks during the fifth and sixth days, killing roughly 10,000 of the enemy troops. The Persian elite unit known to the Greeks as &quot;the Immortals&quot; was held back, and two of Xerxes&#x27; brothers (Abrocomes and Hyperanthes) died in battle. On the seventh day (11 August), a Malian Greek traitor named Ephialtes led the Persian general Hydarnes by a mountain track to the rear of the Greeks. At that point Leonidas sent away most of the Greek troops and remained in the pass with his 300 Spartans, 900 helots, 400 Thebans and 700 Thespians. The Thespians stayed entirely of their own will, declaring that they would not abandon Leonidas and his followers. Their leader was Demophilus, son of Diadromes, and as Herodotus writes, &quot;Hence they lived with the Spartans and died with them.&quot;

One theory provided by Herodotus is that Leonidas sent away the remainder of his men because he cared about their safety. The King would have thought it wise to preserve those Greek troops for future battles against the Persians, but he knew that the Spartans could never abandon their post on the battlefield. The soldiers who stayed behind were to protect their escape against the Persian cavalry. Herodotus believed that Leonidas gave the order because he perceived the allies to be disheartened and unwilling to encounter the danger to which his own mind was made up. He therefore chose to dismiss all the troops except the Thebans, Thespians and helots and save the glory for the Spartans.

Of the small Greek force, which was attacked from both sides, all were killed except for the 400 Thebans, who surrendered to Xerxes without a fight. When Leonidas was killed, the Spartans retrieved his body after driving back the Persians four times. Herodotus says that Xerxes&#x27; orders were to have Leonidas&#x27; head cut off and put on a stake and his body crucified. This was considered sacrilegious.

==Legacy==
A hero cult of Leonidas survived in Sparta until the Antonine era (2nd century AD). Leonideia (λεωνιδεῖα) were solemnities celebrated every year in Sparta in honour of Leonidas and only Spartans were allowed to take part. The contest was held opposite the theatre at Sparta where there were the two sepulchral monuments of Pausanias and Leonidas.

===Modern culture===

A bronze statue of Leonidas was erected at Thermopylae in 1955. A sign, under the statue, reads simply: &quot;ΜΟΛΩΝ ΛΑΒΕ&quot; (&quot;Come and take them&quot;), which was Leonidas&#x27; laconic reply when Xerxes offered to spare the lives of the Spartans if they gave up their arms. Another statue, also with the inscription ΜΟΛΩΝ ΛΑΒΕ, was erected in Sparta in 1969.

Another monument to Leonidis was erected in Brunswick, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia, in November 2009. Brunswick is known as &quot;the suburb of the Spartans&quot; due to an influx of migrants from the Laconian region of Greece during the 1950s and 1960s.

&quot;Leonidas&quot; was the name of an epic poem written by Richard Glover, which originally appeared in 1737. It went on to appear in four other editions, being expanded from 9 books to 12. He is a central figure in Steven Pressfield&#x27;s novel &quot;Gates of Fire&quot;, and appears as the protagonist of Frank Miller&#x27;s 1998 comic book series &quot;300&quot;. It presents a fictionalised version of Leonidas and the Battle of Thermopylae, as does the 2006 feature film adapted from it.

In cinema, Leonidas has been portrayed by: Richard Egan in the 1962 epic &quot;The 300 Spartans&quot;; Gerard Butler in the 2006 film &quot;300&quot;, inspired by the graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley (Tyler Neitzel portrayed Leonidas as a young man); Sean Maguire in the 2008 film &quot;Meet the Spartans&quot;, a parody of the 2006 film.

<text>Hornsey () is a district of north London, England, in the London Borough of Haringey. It is an inner-suburban, for the most part residential, area centred north of Charing Cross. It adjoins green spaces Queen&#x27;s Wood to the west and Alexandra Park to the north, and lies in the valley of the now-culverted River Moselle. The central core of the area is known as Hornsey Village.

==Locale==
Hornsey is relatively old, and the oldest recorded village [1202, according to the Place Names of Middlesex] now in London. Originally a village, it grew up along Hornsey High Street- at the eastern end of which is the churchyard and tower of the former St Mary&#x27;s parish church, which was first mentioned in 1291. At the western end is Priory Park. This was the administrative centre of the historically broad parish.

North of Hornsey High Street, and immediately to its south, some of the area is public sector housing, surrounded by the late-Victorian terraces developed by builders such as John Farrer. Between the western end of the High Street and the bottom of Muswell Hill, the character of the area changes; most being part of the Warner Estate built up with large late-Victorian houses. To the south west of the High Street is Priory Park.

The High Street has a variety of shops, coffee shops, restaurants and pubs, the oldest being the Three Compasses. The eastern section retains strips of grassed areas. 

The 13th-century St Mary&#x27;s Tower is all that remains of St Mary&#x27;s Church. The nave was demolished in Victorian times and a grey stone church was built on the corner of Church Lane and Hornsey High Street. The tower was retained as there were not enough funds raised for a new bell tower. However, in the late &#x27;60s the Victorian church was demolished and St Mary&#x27;s school was built on the site. 

The 500-year-old Tower was restored and managed by the charity, Friends of Hornsey Church Tower (FoHCT). It is now used for open-air live performances and occasional services. The internal space, known as The Intimate Space, claims to be London&#x27;s smallest performance space. It has become one of the four key venues of the Crouch End Festival that now runs an annual two-day music festival, The Tower Music Festival. Hornsey Parish Church holds open-air services there every Sunday.

Hornsey also has a Bowling Club which is situated on land owned by the London Diocesan Fund, part of the Diocese of London. The London Diocesan Fund had expressed an interest in building new homes on the site of the Bowling Club in 2015.

Priory Park is, along with Alexandra Park, the main park serving the area. It is a 6.5-hectare site. Two key events that happen in the park annually are the YMCA Fun Run and the Carter&#x27;s Steam Fair. It has a cafe, kid&#x27;s paddling pool and tennis courts.
The park was originally opened in 1896 as the Middle Lane Pleasure Grounds.[2] In 1926 the western section was added after the acquisition of a piece of land known as Lewcock&#x27;s Field. The expanded park was renamed Priory Park The park was created in two sections. Two parcels of land at the eastern and southern ends were purchased in 1891 by the Borough of Hornsey at the instigation of Henry Reader Williams and opened in 1896 as the Middle Lane Pleasure Grounds. In 1926 the western section was added after the acquisition of a piece of land known as Lewcock&#x27;s Field. During World War 1 this had been requisitioned by the council for allotments. After the war an initial plan for the council to develop the field for housing was dropped on grounds of cost, and an expanded park was renamed Priory Park in 1926. Some locals have suggested it be renamed Hornsey Park.

Hornsey is served by 6 major churches including Hornsey Parish Church, Holy Innocents, Moravian, Middle Lane Methodist, St John The Baptist Greek Orthodox Church and Campsbourne Baptist Church. Mosques in the area include Wightman Road Mosque and Diyanet Camii.

==Geography==

There are various views as to the location of Hornsey&#x27;s current boundaries. The northern and eastern boundaries are relatively uncontentious. Although the eastern boundary of the parish was Green Lanes, it is alleged by some that these are now restricted by Alexandra Park and the Great Northern Railway respectively. The southern and western boundaries are less clear cut. A recent version of those boundaries was provided by local opinion as expressed in a small residents&#x27; survey undertaken as part of the application for the Crouch End Neighbourhood Forum. It offers a contemporary view of where local residents see the boundary between Hornsey and Crouch End and so defines the southern and western boundaries. The area defined is almost identical to that presented by one individual on a personal Google Map. Both closely resemble the post-19th-century Anglican parish and refer to former methods of property reference such as the layout of building schemes (developers&#x27; estates).

==History==

The name Hornsey has its origin in the Saxon period and is derived from the name of a Saxon chieftain called Haering. Haering&#x27;s Hege meant Haering&#x27;s enclosure. The earliest-written form of the name was recorded as Harenhg&#x27; in about 1195. Its development thereafter gave rise to the modern-day names of Harringay (the district of London), the London Borough of Haringey and Hornsey. The church was first mentioned in 1291. Hornsey Village developed along what is now Hornsey High Street, and in the seventeenth century it was bisected by the New River that crossed the village in three places: first at the end of Nightingale Lane, secondly from behind the Three Compasses and lastly, as it does now, at the bottom of Tottenham Lane. The village grew dramatically after about 1860 and eventually merged with the separate settlement at Crouch End (first mentioned in 1465), to form an urban area in the middle of the parish.

Hornsey was a much larger original ancient parish than today&#x27;s electoral ward of the same name. These entities are smaller than the Municipal Borough of Hornsey which co-governed the area with Middlesex County Council from 1889 until 1965, since when the name refers, as a minimum, to the London neighbourhood with a high street at its traditional heart to the west of Hornsey railway station. Its parish ranked sixth in size, of more than forty in Ossulstone, the largest hundred in Middlesex and was a scattered semi-rural community of 2,716 people in 1801. By 1901 the population had risen about eightfold in forty years, reaching 87,626, by which time new localities/districts, mainly Crouch End and Muswell Hill, were popularly becoming considered distinct from Hornsey. The N8 postcode district, the current form of Hornsey ward as devised from time-to-time for equal representation (electorate) across wards of the Borough, and the choice of other railway and tube stations towards, on these definitions, outer parts create conflicting definitions of Hornsey and it is unclear whether since 1965 the term is distinct from Hornsey Village, a term unrecognised by some residents.

The old parish used to have two small detached parts immediately beyond and within Stoke Newington Parish. In the 1840s the parish had 5,937 residents, slightly reduced by the loss of Finsbury Park but comprised taking in besides its own village, the established hamlets of Muswell Hill, Crouch End, Stroud Green, and part of Highgate.

In the later eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth century, Hornsey became an increasingly popular area for wealthy merchants wanting a comfortable home close to London. With them came the laying out some large estates and subsequently the development of large villas along the principal routes. The arrival of the railway in 1850 made Hornsey a commuter town and accelerated urban development. In the late 1860s, large areas of Hornsey were developed by freehold land societies for working-class housing including Abyssinia (later known as Hornsey Vale) and Campsbourne. Development of a generally much more middle-class nature continued throughout the Victorian and Edwardian eras with the final gaps being filled during interwar period. Most of the early freehold land estates have since been demolished for public housing, or in the case of Abyssinia (Hornsey Vale) to accommodate the Hornsey School for Girls.

The tower of the original parish church still stands in its ancient graveyard in Hornsey High Street, at the centre of the old village. Well-known people buried in the churchyard include English poet Samuel Rogers and Dutch poet Gerrit van de Linde [Schoolmeester|Gerrit van de Linde] [aka The Schoolmaster]. 

Other notable places are the former Hornsey Town Hall in Crouch End, and Highpoint and Cromwell House in Highgate. On the north side of the High Street was the old public bath and wash house (not to be confused with Hornsey Road Baths &amp; Laundry away on Hornsey Road) which was demolished to make way for a new housing scheme and Sainsbury&#x27;s. Opened in 1932, it had 33,000 users a year in the 1950s. A small group of residents wished Haringey Council to purchase the site and install arts and crafts studios, with a gallery, primarily for local artists.

For 1978 to 2002 in the borough, having in its initial 13 years no wards mentioning &quot;Hornsey&quot;, three wards bearing the name existed and so popularised it among bordering, competing areas with newer names, strongly reflecting their historic, shared identity:
#Hornsey Central
#Hornsey Vale
#South Hornsey

===Economic development===

In the 1840&#x27;s a section of a major new railway line from London to the north, the Great Northern Railway (Great Britain), was constructed right through Hornsey near to the centre of the village, and a station - the first out of London on the line - was built to serve it on Tottenham Lane, opened on 8th August 1850. It was successful and sidings on both sides of the line were constructed s well as goods depots, so Hornsey became somewhat of a railway town. This tradition contines: two major maintenance depots for the new electric trains running from Finsbury Park to Brighton have been constructed beside the main line.

In 1870 the first shop of what would become the David Greig national grocery chain, once a rival to Sainsbury&#x27;s, was opened in 32 Hornsey High Street by Greig&#x27;s mother.

In 1951 the first Lotus Cars factory was established in stables behind the Railway Hotel (now No5 Dining) on Tottenham Lane. The company was formed as Lotus Engineering Ltd by Colin Chapman. The Railway Hotel pub was owned by Chapman&#x27;s father. In its early days, Lotus sold cars aimed at private racers and trialists. Its early road cars could be bought as kits, in order to save on purchase tax. Lotus moved to Cheshunt in 1959, and to Hethel in Norfolk in 1966. Adjacent to the pub was the first Lotus showroom (formerly part of Jewson&#x27;s) where there is now a memorial plaque to Colin Chapman erected by Club Lotus. An application to demolish the building by Jewson&#x27;s, listed by Haringey Council as an &quot;historic building of interest&quot;, was turned down following a public campaign by local resident Chris Arnold, son of the former Lotus Sales Director Graham Arnold. It was briefly a plumbing shop but is now empty. Suggestions have been made to turn it into a Colin Chapman museum or the Colin Chapman Innovation Centre for young people. The site is now being developed by Fifth State [proposal] as the Lotus Buildings and will celebrate the Lotus heritage with a community cafe, new public spaces and housing for students.

Established in 1964, Hornsey Co-operative Credit Union was Britain&#x27;s oldest credit union, until it merged with London Capital Credit Union in 2013.

Since 2000 Hornsey&#x27;s residential developments have been architecturally diverse and overall accommodative of a diverse range of the local community. This has included estates of more than 50 homes with a proportion available under social housing and affordable housing schemes.

The Hornsey Water Treatment Works were developed alongside the New River, the water supply system constructed in the 17th century that brings water from Hertfordshire to London. The brick buildings associated with the works were the last constructed by the New River Company before the Metropolitan Water Board took over in 1904. They are now run by Thames Water and still supply some of London&#x27;s water.

==Rail transport==

The East Coast Main Line from to the east Midlands, northern England and Scotland, successor to the GNR mentioned above, crosses Hornsey. Local commuter and regional services are provided from Hornsey railway station by Great Northern into Central London ending in Moorgate and towards Hertfordshire. A change at Finsbury Park station gives direct access on the overground lines to central London, south London and Brighton. Turnpike Lane tube station on the Piccadilly Line is the nearest Underground station.

==Education==

Secondary schools serving the area include Greig City Academy, Hornsey School for Girls and Highgate Wood Secondary School.
Primary schools within Hornsey include Campsbourne Primary School and St Mary&#x27;s Primary School.

==In literature==

In Jonathan Coe&#x27;s 1987 debut novel &quot;The Accidental Woman&quot;, the protagonist Maria shares a flat in Hornsey with two other women for several years.
