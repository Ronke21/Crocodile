<text>Suspense is a radio drama series broadcast on CBS Radio from 1940 through 1962.

One of the premier drama programs of the Golden Age of Radio, was subtitled &quot;radio&#x27;s outstanding theater of thrills&quot; and focused on suspense thriller-type scripts, usually featuring leading Hollywood actors of the era. Approximately 945 episodes were broadcast during its long run, and more than 900 still exist.

&quot;Suspense&quot; went through several major phases, characterized by different hosts, sponsors, and director/producers. Formula plot devices were followed for all but a handful of episodes: the protagonist was usually a normal person suddenly dropped into a threatening or bizarre situation; solutions were &quot;withheld until the last possible second&quot;; and evildoers were usually punished in the end.

In its early years, the program made only occasional forays into science fiction and fantasy. Notable exceptions include adaptations of Curt Siodmak&#x27;s &quot;Donovan&#x27;s Brain&quot; and H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;, but by the late 1950s, such material was regularly featured.

==Alfred Hitchcock==
Alfred Hitchcock directed its audition show (for the CBS summer series &quot;Forecast&quot;). This was an adaptation of &quot;The Lodger&quot; a story Hitchcock had filmed in 1926 with Ivor Novello. Martin Grams Jr., author of &quot;Suspense: Twenty Years of Thrills and Chills&quot;, described the &quot;Forecast&quot; origin of &quot;Suspense&quot;:

On the second presentation of July 22, 1940, &quot;Forecast&quot; offered a mystery/horror show titled &quot;Suspense.&quot; With the co-operation of his producer, Walter Wanger, Alfred Hitchcock received the honor of directing his first radio show for the American public. The condition agreed upon for Hitchcock&#x27;s appearance was that CBS make a pitch to the listening audience about his and Wanger&#x27;s latest film, &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot;. To add flavor to the deal, Wanger threw in Edmund Gwenn and Herbert Marshall as part of the package. All three men (including Hitch) would be seen in the upcoming film, which was due for a theatrical release the next month. Both Marshall and Hitchcock decided on the same story to bring to the airwaves, which happened to be a favorite of both of them: Marie Belloc Lowndes&#x27; &quot;The Lodger.&quot; Alfred Hitchcock had filmed this story for Gainsborough in 1926, and since then it had remained as one of his favorites.

Herbert Marshall portrayed the mysterious lodger, and co-starring with him were Edmund Gwenn and character actress Lurene Tuttle as the rooming-house keepers who start to suspect that their new boarder might be the notorious Jack-the-Ripper. [Gwenn was actually repeating the role taken in the 1926 film by his brother, Arthur Chesney. And Tuttle would work again with Hitchcock nearly 20 years later, playing Mrs. Al Chambers, the sheriff&#x27;s wife, in &quot;Psycho.&quot;] Character actor Joseph Kearns also had a small part in the drama, and Wilbur Hatch, head musician for CBS Radio at the time, composed and conducted the music specially for the program. Adapting the script to radio was not a great technical challenge for Hitchcock, and he cleverly decided to hold back the ending of the story from the listening audience in order to keep them in suspense themselves. This way, if the audience&#x27;s curiosity got the better of them, they would write in to the network to find out whether the mysterious lodger was in fact Jack the Ripper. For the next few weeks, hundreds of letters came in from faithful listeners asking how the story ended. Actually a few wrote threats claiming that it was &quot;indecent&quot; and &quot;immoral&quot; to present such a production without giving the solution
==1942–1962==
In the earliest years, the program was hosted by &quot;The Man in Black&quot; (played by Joseph Kearns or Ted Osborne) with many episodes written or adapted by the prominent mystery author John Dickson Carr.

One of the series&#x27; earliest successes and its single most popular episode is Lucille Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot;, about a bedridden woman (Agnes Moorehead) who panics after overhearing a murder plot on a crossed telephone connection but is unable to persuade anyone to investigate. First broadcast on May 25, 1943, it was restaged seven times (last on February 14, 1960)each time with Moorehead. The popularity of the episode led to a film adaptation in 1948. Another notable early episode was Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;The Hitch Hiker&quot; (aired September 2, 1942), in which a motorist (Orson Welles) is stalked on a cross-country trip by a nondescript man who keeps appearing on the side of the road; however, the first performance of &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot; actually took place on &quot;The Orson Welles Show&quot; the previous year. &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot; was later adapted for television by Rod Serling as a 1960 episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

After the network sustained the program during its first two years, the sponsor became Roma Wines (1944–1947), and then (after another brief period of sustained hour-long episodes, initially featuring Robert Montgomery as host and &quot;producer&quot; in early 1948), Autolite Spark Plugs (1948–1954); eventually Harlow Wilcox (of &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot;) became the pitchman. William Spier, Norman Macdonnell and Anton M. Leader were among the producers and directors.

&quot;Suspense&quot; received a Special Citation of Honor Peabody Award for 1946.

The program&#x27;s heyday was in the early 1950s, when radio actor, producer and director Elliott Lewis took over (still during the Wilcox/Autolite run). Here the material reached new levels of sophistication. The writing was taut, and the casting, which had always been a strong point of the series (featuring such film stars as Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, Henry Fonda, Humphrey Bogart, Judy Garland, Ronald Colman, Marlene Dietrich, Eve McVeagh, Lena Horne, and Cary Grant), took an unexpected turn when Lewis expanded the repertory to include many of radio&#x27;s famous drama and comedy starsoften playing against typesuch as Jack Benny. Jim and Marian Jordan of &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; were heard in the episode &quot;Backseat Driver&quot;, which originally aired February 3, 1949.

The highest production values enhanced &quot;Suspense&quot;, and many of the shows retain their power to grip and entertain. At the time he took over &quot;Suspense&quot;, Lewis was familiar to radio fans for playing Frankie Remley, the wastrel guitar-playing sidekick to Phil Harris in &quot;The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show&quot;. On the May 10, 1951 &quot;Suspense&quot;, Lewis reversed the roles with &quot;Death on My Hands&quot;: A bandleader (Harris) is horrified when an autograph-seeking fan accidentally shoots herself and dies in his hotel room, and a vocalist (Faye) tries to help him as the townfolk call for vigilante justice against him.

With the rise of television and the departures of Lewis and Autolite, subsequent producers (Antony Ellis, William N. Robson and others) struggled to maintain the series due to shrinking budgets, the availability of fewer name actors, and listenership decline. To save money, the program frequently used scripts first broadcast by another noteworthy CBS anthology, &quot;Escape&quot;. In addition to these tales of exotic adventure, &quot;Suspense&quot; expanded its repertoire to include more science fiction and supernatural content. By the end of its run, the series was remaking scripts from the long-canceled program &quot;The Mysterious Traveler&quot;. A time travel tale like Robert Arthur&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Went Back to Save Lincoln&quot; or a thriller about a death ray-wielding mad scientist would alternate with more run-of-the-mill crime dramas.

The series expanded to television with the &quot;Suspense&quot; series on CBS from 1949 to 1954, and again in 1962. The radio series had a tie-in with &quot;Suspense&quot; magazine which published four 1946–47 issues edited by Leslie Charteris.

The final broadcasts of &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot; and &quot;Suspense&quot;, ending at 7:00 pm Eastern Time on September 30, 1962, are often cited as the end of the Golden Age of Radio. The final episode of &quot;Suspense&quot; was &quot;Devilstone&quot;, starring Christopher Carey and Neal Fitzgerald. It was sponsored by Parliament cigarettes.

==Opening introductions==
There were several variations of program introductions. A typical early opening is this from April 27, 1943:
:(MUSIC ... BERNARD HERRMANN&#x27;S SUSPENSE THEME ... CONTINUES IN BG)

:THE MAN IN BLACK: Suspense!

:This is The Man in Black, here again to introduce Columbia&#x27;s program, &quot;Suspense&quot;.

:Our stars tonight are Miss Agnes Moorehead and Mr. Ray Collins. You&#x27;ve seen these two expert and resourceful players in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; – &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; in which Miss Moorehead&#x27;s performance won her the 1942 Film Critics&#x27; Award. Mr. Collins will soon be seen in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Technicolor film, &quot;Salute to the Marines.&quot;

:Miss Moorehead and Mr. Collins return this evening to their first love, the CBS microphone, to appear in a study in terror by Lucille Fletcher called &quot;The Diary of Sophronia Winters.&quot;

:The story told by this diary is tonight&#x27;s tale of... suspense. If you&#x27;ve been with us on these Tuesday nights, you will know that Suspense is compounded of mystery and suspicion and dangerous adventure. In this series are tales calculated to intrigue you, to stir your nerves, to offer you a precarious situation and then withhold the solution... until the last possible moment. And so it is with &quot;The Diary of Sophronia Winters&quot; and the performances of Agnes Moorehead and Ray Collins, we again hope to keep you in...

:(MUSIC: ... UP, DRAMATICALLY)

:THE MAN IN BLACK: ... &quot;Suspense!&quot;

==Recognition==
&quot;Suspense&quot; was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2011.

Since 2007, Radio Classics (Sirius XM channel 148) has been airing episodes of &quot;Suspense&quot;. The show is also streamed nightly at 7 pm Pacific time on kusaradio.com from the original masters.

==Satire==
The familiar opening phrase &quot;tales well-calculated to...&quot; was satirized by &quot;Mad&quot; as the cover blurb &quot;Tales Calculated to Drive You... &quot;Mad&quot;&quot; on its first issue (October–November 1952) and continuing until issue #23 (May 1955).

Radio comedians Bob and Ray had a recurring routine lampooning the show called &quot;Anxiety.&quot; Their character Commander Neville Putney told stories that were presented as dramatic but were intentionally mundane, with the opening line &quot;A tale well designed to keep you in... Anxiety.&quot;

In the “Chicken Heart” sketch on his Wonderfulness album Bill Cosby relates radio programs during his youth “that were scary.” One is Suspense.

==Theater==
For PowPAC, San Diego actor-director Robert Hitchcox mounted a 2006 stage production recreating two episodes of &quot;Suspense&quot;, complete with commercials, in a stage set designed like a CBS radio studio.

<text>The New Deal coalition was an American political coalition that supported the Democratic Party beginning in 1932. The coalition is named after President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal programs, and the follow-up Democratic presidents. It was composed of voting blocs who supported them. The coalition included labor unions, blue-collar workers, big city machines, racial and religious minorities (especially Jews, Catholics, and African Americans), white Southerners, and intellectuals. Besides voters the coalition included powerful interest groups: Democratic Party organizations in most states, city machines, labor unions, some third parties, universities, and foundations. It was largely opposed by the Republican Party, the business community, and wealthy Protestants. In creating his coalition, Roosevelt was at first eager to include liberal Republicans and some radical third parties, even if it meant downplaying the &quot;Democratic&quot; name. By the 1940s, the Republican and third-party allies had mostly been defeated. In 1948, the Democratic Party stood alone and won both the White House and both Congressional houses with a mandate, surviving the splits that created two splinter parties.

The coalition made the Democratic Party the majority party nationally for decades. Democrats lost control of the White House only in 1952 and 1956 during the broadly popular Eisenhower presidency. They typically controlled both Houses of Congress before the 1990s. The coalition began to weaken with the collapse of big city machines after 1940, the steady decline of labor unions after 1970, the bitter factionalism during the 1968 election, the turn of White Northern ethnics and Southern Whites toward conservatism on racial issues, and the rise of neoliberalism under the presidency of Ronald Reagan, with its opposition to regulation.

==History==
===Formation===
The Great Depression in the United States began in 1929 and was often blamed on Republicans and their big business allies. Republican president Herbert Hoover opposed federal relief efforts as unwarranted, believing that market actors and local governments were better suited to address the situation. As the depression worsened, voters became increasingly dissatisfied with this approach and came to view President Hoover as indifferent to their economic struggles. Franklin D. Roosevelt won a landslide in 1932 and spent his time in office building a powerful nationwide coalition and keeping his partners from squabbling with each other.

Over the course of the 1930s, Roosevelt forged a coalition of liberals, labor unions, Northern religious and ethnic minorities (Catholic, Jewish, and Black), and Southern Whites. These voting blocs together formed a majority of voters and handed the Democratic Party seven victories out of nine presidential elections (1932–1948, 1960, 1964), as well as control of both houses of Congress during all but four years between the years 1932–1980 (Republicans won small majorities in 1946 and 1952). Political scientists describe this realignment as the &quot;Fifth Party System&quot;, in contrast to the Fourth Party System of the 1896–1932 era that proceeded it.

City machines had major roles to play. Most important, the New Deal coalition had to carry entire states, not just cities. The largest possible landslide was needed, and the city machines came through in 1940, 1944, and 1948. They kept the voters by providing federal jobs aimed at the unemployed—the Civil Works Administration, the Civilian Conservation Corps (where the boys&#x27; wages went to the unemployed father), the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, and especially the Works Progress Administration (WPA). A representative transition came in Pittsburgh, which had long been a Republican stronghold with a promise of prosperity. The worsening depression enabled the Democrats to convince some Republicans to switch parties while mobilizing large numbers of ethnics who had not voted before. Democrats capitalized on Roosevelt&#x27;s popularity to win the 1933 mayoral race. The WPA then played a critical role in the consolidation of the Democratic machine. By 1936 the Democrats had a majority in the registration rolls for the first time since the Civil War. That November FDR won 70% of the Pittsburgh vote.

===Roosevelt moves left===
The president in 1933 wanted to bring all major groups together, business and labor, banker and borrower, farms and towns, liberals and conservatives. The escalating attacks from the right, typified by the American Liberty League led by his old friend Al Smith, spoiled the dream. Sensing how quickly public opinion was becoming more radical, Roosevelt moved left. He attacked big business. His major innovations now were social security for the elderly, the WPA for the unemployed, and a new labor relations act to support and encourage labor unions. Running for reelection in 1936, Roosevelt personalized the campaign and downplayed the Democratic Party name. In contrast to his 1933 position as a neutral moderator between business and workers, he now became a strong labor union supporter. He crusaded against the rich upper class, denouncing the &quot;economic royalists&quot;. He worked with third parties on the left: the Minnesota Farmer–Labor Party, the Wisconsin Progressive Party, and the American Labor Party (ALP) in New York state. In New York City he collaborated closely with Republican Fiorello La Guardia, against the conservatives of Tammany Hall who had controlled city hall. La Guardia was the candidate of the ad-hoc City Fusion Party, winning the mayoralty in 1933 and reelection in 1937 and 1941. La Guardia was also the nominee of the American Labor Party (ALP), a union-dominated left-wing group that supported Roosevelt in 1936, 1940,and 1944. The role of the ALP was to funnel socialists who distrusted the Democratic Party into the New Deal coalition. In 1940 La Guardia chaired the nationwide Committee of Independent Voters for Roosevelt; in return, the president put him in charge of the Office of Civilian Defense. He retired and was replaced as mayor in 1945 by William O&#x27;Dwyer, the Tammany candidate.

===WPA jobs and Democratic party organizations===
Roosevelt&#x27;s top aide in distributing patronage was James Farley, who served simultaneously as chair of the New York State Democratic Party, chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and Postmaster General in FDR&#x27;s cabinet, as well as FDR&#x27;s campaign manager in 1932 and 1940. He handled traditional patronage for the Post Office. He helped with the new agencies aimed at the unemployed, especially the Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps, as well as other job agencies. He helped state and local Democratic organizations set up systems to select likely candidates for the federal payroll. In the 1940s most of the big city machines collapsed, with a few exceptions such as Chicago and Albany, New York.

Being a voter or a Democrat was not a prerequisite for a relief job. Federal law specifically prohibited any political discrimination regarding WPA workers. Vague charges were bandied about at the time. The consensus of experts is that: “In the distribution of WPA project jobs as opposed to those of a supervisory and administrative nature politics plays only a minor in a comparatively insignificant role.&quot; However those who were hired were reminded at election time that FDR created their job and the Republicans would take it away. The great majority voted accordingly.

===Decline and fall===
After the end of the Great Depression around 1941, the next challenge was to keep Democratic majorities alive. It seemed impossible after the GOP landslide in 1946. Journalist Samuel Lubell found in his in-depth interviews of voters after the 1948 presidential election that Democrat Harry Truman, not Republican Thomas E. Dewey, seemed the safer, more conservative candidate to the &quot;new middle class&quot; that had developed over the previous 20 years. He wrote that &quot;to an appreciable part of the electorate, the Democrats had replaced the Republicans as the party of prosperity.&quot;

In 1952 and 1956 Republican Dwight Eisenhower had been able to temporarily peel several elements of the coalition into the Republican column, notably some Northern farmers and manual workers and middle-class voters in the Border South. In the 1960 election, John F. Kennedy and his running mate Lyndon Johnson won back Southern voters.

After the smashing reelection victory of President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, the heavily Democratic Congress passed a raft of liberal legislation. Labor union leaders claimed credit for the widest range of liberal laws since the New Deal era, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Voting Rights Act of 1965; the War on Poverty; aid to cities and education; increased Social Security benefits; and Medicare for the elderly. The 1966 elections were an unexpected disaster, with defeats for many of the more liberal Democrats. According to Alan Draper, the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Action (COPE) was the main electioneering unit of the labor movement. It ignored the White backlash against civil rights, which had become a main Republican attack point. The COPE assumed falsely that union members were interested in issues of greatest salience to union leadership, but polls showed this was not true as the members were much more conservative. The younger ones were much more concerned about taxes and crime, and the older ones had not overcome racial biases. Labor unions began to lose their members and influence in the 1970s as the economy became more service-oriented and the proportion of manufacturing jobs declined. Companies began relocating manufacturing jobs to Sun Belt states, free of labor union influences, and many Americans followed suit. As a result, union membership steadily declined. Labor unions were painted as corrupt, ineffective, and outdated by the Republican Party.

During the 1960s, issues as civil rights and racial integration, the Vietnam War and the counterculture of the 1960s, affirmative action, and large-scale urban riots further split the coalition and drove many Whites away, signalling that the coalition started to fall. The War in Vietnam split the liberal coalition into hawks (led by Johnson and Vice President Hubert Humphrey) and doves (led by Senators Eugene McCarthy and Robert Kennedy). In addition after the John F. Kennedy assassination, the coalition lacked a leader of the stature of Roosevelt. The closest was Lyndon B. Johnson (president 1963–1969), who tried to reinvigorate the old coalition but was unable to hold together the feuding components, especially after his handling of the Vietnam War alienated the emerging New Left. Besides Johnson, another who came closest was Robert Kennedy, the likely Democratic candidate in 1968. The assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, in the space of just two months, seem to have been an almost fatal blow to the New Deal coalition prospects.

====Reagan Era and the Southern Strategy====
During the Presidency of Ronald Reagan (1981–1989), Republicans took control of prosperity issues, largely because of the poor performance of Jimmy Carter (1977–1981) in dealing with stagflation. Reagan&#x27;s new economic policy of neoliberalism held that regulation was bad for economic growth and that tax cuts would bring sustained prosperity. In 1994 the Republicans swept control of Congress for the first time since 1952. The response of Democratic President Bill Clinton was: “We know big government does not have all the answers. We know there&#x27;s not a program for every problem...The era of big government is over.” Clinton went on to cut New Deal-inspired welfare programs and repeal some of the New Deal&#x27;s restrictions on banks. Clinton largely accepted the neoliberal argument, thereby abandoning the New Deal coalition&#x27;s claim to the prosperity issue.

While most Northerners supported the original civil rights movement, many conservative blue collar voters disliked the goal of racial integration and became fearful of rising urban crime. The Republicans, first under Richard Nixon, then later under Reagan, were able to corral these voters with promises to be tough on law and order. The votes of blue-collar workers contributed heavily to the Republican landslides of 1972 and 1984, and to a lesser extent 1980 and 1988. At the presidential level, the GOP made inroads among urban, middle-class White Southerners as early as 1928 and later in 1952. Starting in 1980, Reagan pulled together both middle-class and working-class White Southerners. At the state and local level the GOP made steady gains in both White groups until reaching majority status in most of the South by 2000.

Scholars debate exactly why the New Deal coalition collapsed so completely. Most emphasize a Southern Strategy by Republicans to appeal to a backlash against Democratic national support for civil rights. However, a minority of scholars consider a demographic change in addition to race. They argue that the collapse of cotton agriculture, the growth of a suburban middle class, and the large-scale arrival of Northern migrants outweighed the racist factor. Both viewpoints agree that the politicization of religious issues important to White Southern Protestants (i.e. opposition to abortion and LGBT rights) in the &quot;Bible Belt&quot; made for a strong Republican appeal.

==Components in 1930s==
===Third Parties===
Roosevelt wanted a coalition that was broader than just the Democratic Party. He admired old Progressives now in the GOP, such as George W. Norris of Nebraska and Senator Robert M. La Follette Jr. of Wisconsin. He disliked the conservativism of Wisconsin Democrats and preferred to work with the Progressive Party there. The Farmer-Labor Party of Minnesota made an informal alliance with FDR and supported him in 1936; the Minnesota Democrats were a weak third party. The White House supported the Farmer-Labor Party (FLP) in Minnesota. Roosevelt had an informal deal with Governor Floyd B. Olson whereby the FLP would get some of the patronage, and in turn the FLP would work to block a third-party ticket against Roosevelt in 1936. The radical third parties declined rapidly after 1936 and no longer played a part in the New Deal coalition.

===Pressure from the Left===
As the economy began to improve in 1933–34, people loudly demanded faster action and pushed the New Dealers to the left. Labor strikes grew to large scale, especially in California and Minnesota. Textile workers launched the largest strike in national history in 1934. Senator Huey Long in Louisiana and radio priest Charles Coughlin, had both been active Roosevelt supporters in 1932. They now broke away and set up national appeals to millions of supporters, with talk of a third party to the left of Roosevelt in 1936. Long was assassinated but his followers did set up the Union Party that polled 2% of the vote in the 1936 United States presidential election. In California, Upton Sinclair, a famous novelist and socialist won the Democratic nomination for governor, on a left-wing ticket in 1934. His EPIC program promised to end poverty and unemployment by a setting up state-owned factories to hire the unemployed, and by increasing pensions for the elderly. Critics said it would flood the state with unemployed from everywhere else. Sinclair had a pension plan of his own and refused to endorse the Townsend Plan which had a strong following. The Republican candidate endorsed the Townsend Plan and won the movement&#x27;s support. Sinclair was narrowly defeated by a combination of defections of prominent Democrats—including Roosevelt—as well as a massive smear campaign using Hollywood techniques and a blackout whereby all the state&#x27;s newspapers opposed him and refused to cover his ideas. The Republican leadership realized the California electorate was moving left so it went along. Its 1934 platform endorsed not just the Townsend Plan but also the 30 hour work week, unemployment relief, and collective bargaining for all workers. The GOP wanted to win votes but in the process it legitimized a social welfare state as a bipartisan ideal. Consequently, the California experience helped push New Deal towards social welfare legislation, especially the WPA and Social Security. Sinclair&#x27;s campaign gave aspiring Democratic leaders a boost, most notably Culbert Olson, who was elected governor in 1938. Needing an alternative to the New Deal&#x27;s Social Security system, many Republicans around the country endorsed the Townsend Plan.

=== Class ethnicity, and religion ===
In the northern states, class and ethnicity proved decisive factors in the New Deal coalition as shown by polling data in presidential and congressional elections from 1936 through 1968. Over the period, blue-collar workers averaged 63% Democratic voters. White collar workers, representing the middle class, averaged 43% Democratic. By religious affiliation over the period, while northern White Protestants averaged 58% Republican, White Catholics were 68% Democrats. Social class and religious affiliation had separate effects that could intersect, so that Catholic blue-collar workers were 76% Democratic, while Protestant blue-collar workers were only 52% Democratic. Throughout the period, better educated higher income middle-class voters tended to lean more towards Republicans, so that average Northern Protestant white collar voters were 69% Republican, while a Catholic counterpart was only 41% Republican. A dichotomy formed in the north between Catholic blue-collar workers forming the core of the Democratic Party, while Protestant businessmen, professionals, and clerical workers fell in with the GOP. A Gallup poll of listees in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; in early 1936 showed that only 31% planned to vote for Roosevelt. Nationwide, Roosevelt won 36% of the votes of business and professional voters in 1940, 48% of lower-level white-collar workers, 66% of blue-collar workers, and 54% of farmers.
Among various demographics, ethnicity was the strongest reliable identifier for Democrats that held together the New Deal coalition, listed below is the distribution of party identification in 1944 among the northern electorate:
Roosevelt was successful in attracting further support from Italian, Black, and Jewish voters between 1936 to 1940. 

The coalition was strongest among Jews and Catholics and weakest among White Protestants. 
===Labor unions===

The New Dealers made a major, successful effort to build up labor unions, especially through the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. In addition, Democratic-led state governments were much more favorable to unions than the pro-business Republicans had been. In 1940 FDR won 64% of non-union manual workers, 71% of AFL members, and 79% of CIO members. Union membership grew rapidly during World War II. In 1944 FDR won 56% of non-union manual workers, 69% of AFL members, and 79% of CIO members. Truman in 1948 had similar results.
The more militant industrial unions, led by John L. Lewis formed the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), and split off from the more traditional American Federation of Labor in 1938. Both federations added members rapidly, but they feuded bitterly. Both supported Roosevelt and the New Deal Coalition. The nationwide wave of labor strikes in 1937–38 alienated many voters, and the split weakened the New Deal coalition. The most controversial labor leader was John L. Lewis, head of the coal miners; he headed the CIO 1938–1941. Lewis was an isolationist and broke with Roosevelt and endorsed his Republican opponent in the 1940 election, a position demanded by the pro-Soviet far left element in the CIO. Nevertheless, CIO members voted for Roosevelt and Lewis was forced to leave the CIO, taking his United Mine Workers of America union along. Additionally, the coattails of labor candidates and the get-out-the-vote campaigns that were organized by labor unions were a reason for Truman moving ahead in the election of 1948 in many urban-industrial areas. This achievement was done despite Truman’s weaker showing, dragging behind the Democratic party’s congressional ticket by 4%.

===City politics and machines===

City Democratic machines had a new role to play. Traditionally the goal of winning power in the city was facilitated by keeping the vote low and under close watch. As part of the national New Deal coalition, the machines had to carry the state&#x27;s electoral vote. That required turning out the largest possible majorities. They did this by converting some Republicans, mobilizing large numbers who had never voted before. Milton Rakove states: &quot;Holding the South and delivering thumping majorities in the big cities of the North insured national hegemony for the Democratic party.&quot; The new majorities did not matter in the great 1936 landslide, but they were decisive in 1940. A third of the electorate lived in the 106 cities with a population of 100,000 or more. They were 61% for FDR. The South had a sixth of the electorate and FDR won 73%. The remaining half of the electorate—the non-metropolitan North—voted 53% for the Republican Wendell Willkie. The largest possible landslide was needed, and the city machines came through in 1940, 1944, and 1948. In the 1920s strong big city Republican machines were common. During the Great Depression their support plunged, and they were displaced by Democratic machines in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago, St. Louis, and elsewhere. Across the urban North blacks deserted the GOP and were welcomed into the Democratic machine.

Ethnics and Catholics were concentrated in large cities, which gave them a more Democratic hue. The 103 largest cities with a population of 100,000 or more in 1950 were Democratic strongholds, typically with former machines that had faded away during and after World War II. The largest cities averaged 66% for FDR in 1932 and 1936, compared to 58% of the rest of the country. The cities dropped 5 points to 61% for FDR in 1940 and 1944, while the rest dropped 7 points to 51%.

==Legacy==
The big-city machines faded away in the 1940s with a few exceptions that lingered a bit such as Albany and Chicago. Local Democrats in most cities were heavily dependent on the WPA for patronage; when it ended in 1943, there was full employment and no replacement patronage source was created. Furthermore, World War II brought such a surge of prosperity that the relief mechanism of the New Deal was no longer needed.

Labor unions crested in size and power in the 1950s but then went into steady decline. They continue to be major backers of the Democrats, but with so few members, they have lost much of their influence. From the 1960s into the 1990s, many jobs moved to the Sun Belt free of union influences, and the Republican Party frequently painted unions as corrupt and ineffective.

Intellectuals gave increasing support to Democrats since 1932. The Vietnam War, however, caused a serious split, with the New Left unwilling to support most of the Democratic presidential nominees. Since the 1990s, the growing number of Americans with a post-graduate degree have supported Democrats. In recent years, White Americans with a college degree have tended to support the Democratic Party, especially among younger voters, while non-college graduates are more likely to support the Republican Party—a reversal of the pattern before 2000.

White Southerners abandoned cotton and tobacco farming, and moved to the cities where the New Deal programs had much less impact. Beginning in the 1950s, the southern cities and suburbs started voting Republican. The White Southerners believed the support that northern Democrats gave to the Civil Rights Movement to be a direct political assault on their interests, which opened the way to protest votes for Barry Goldwater, who, in 1964, was the first Republican to carry the Deep South. Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton lured many of the Southern Whites back at the level of presidential voting, but by 2000, White males in the South were 2–1 Republican and, indeed, formed a major part of the new Republican coalition. Since the 2010s, younger non-evangelical White Southerners with a college degree have been trending towards the Democratic Party, such as in Virginia, Georgia, and North Carolina.

The European ethnic groups came of age after the 1960s. Ronald Reagan pulled many of the working-class social conservatives into the Republican party as Reagan Democrats. Many middle-class ethnic minorities saw the Democratic Party as a working class party, and preferred the GOP as the middle class party. In addition, while many supported the 1964 Civil Rights Act, they were generally opposed to racial integration, and also supported the Republican stance against rising urban crime. However, the Jewish community has continued to vote largely Democratic: 74% voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, 78% in 2008, and 69% in 2012.

African Americans grew stronger in their Democratic loyalties and in their numbers. From the 1930s into the 1960s, black voters in the North began trending Democrat, while those in the South were largely disenfranchised. Following the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, black voters became a much more important part of the Democrat voter base. Their Democratic loyalties have cut across all income and geographic lines to form the single most unified bloc of voters in the country, with over 87% of black voters voting for the Democratic presidential candidate since 2008.

<doc id="86219" wikidata="Q316170" url="?curid=86219" title="Tim Montgomery">
<text>Timothy Montgomery (born January 28, 1975) is an American former track sprinter who specialized in the 100-meter dash. In 2005, he was stripped of his records—including a now-void men&#x27;s 100-meter world record of 9.78 seconds set in 2002—after being found guilty of using performance-enhancing drugs as a central figure in the BALCO scandal. Since retiring from athletics, he has been tried and convicted for his part in a New York–based check fraud scheme and for dealing heroin in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia.

Montgomery&#x27;s first major medal was an Olympic silver in the 4 × 100-meter relay at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. He was a 100-meter bronze medalist at the 1997 World Championships, then shared in the relay gold medal with the United States team at the 1999 World Championships. He also took Olympic gold at the 2000 Summer Olympics with the American relay team. He initially won a silver medal in the 100 meters at the 2001 World Championships, but this was nullified due to doping. His official personal best for the 100 meters stands at 9.92 seconds, making him a sub-10 second sprinter.

==Career==
Born in Gaffney, South Carolina, Montgomery was initially a basketball and football player prior to trying out for track.

Montgomery studied at Blinn College in Brenham, Texas, and transferred to Norfolk State University in 1994. Located in the Hampton Roads area of the Virginia port city of Norfolk, Norfolk State was known for its strong track program. While in school, he competed in several junior track events, and did well in the sprint and relay events.

Montgomery did not qualify for the 100 meters at the 1996 Summer Olympics, but he did compete in Atlanta in the heats of the 4 × 100-meter relay team that eventually finished second behind Canada. He qualified for his first major international tournament in 1997, and won the bronze medal at those World Championships, finishing third behind Maurice Greene. Two years later, Montgomery came in sixth in the individual final, but did win a gold medal with the United States relay team.

Montgomery did not qualify for the individual 100 meters at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, though he again ran as an alternate in the heats of the relay event. In the final, the United States won the gold medal.

Montgomery broke Greene&#x27;s 100-meter world record by 0.01 seconds in September 2002. With a maximum-allowable tailwind of , Montgomery posted a time of 9.78 seconds. This record was later nullified because of doping.

==Business==
In 2014, Montgomery relocated to Gainesville, Florida, to start a business focused on general athletic and sports training for youth and adults. The motto for the business is &quot;Never Underestimate My Ability&quot; as encoded into the business website name NUMA Speed. The motto is a reference to both the initial success, extensive life challenges and ultimate redemption reflected in his athletic and business timeline.

==Steroid scandal==
Montgomery did not qualify for the 2004 Summer Olympics, finishing seventh in the final of the United States Olympic trials. Before the trials, however, he was charged with using illegal performance-enhancing drugs by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). While he has not returned a positive drug test, according to press reports he testified to the agency that he, along with a number of other prominent athletes, obtained steroids and human growth hormone from BALCO, a laboratory near San Francisco. The USADA sought a four-year suspension on Montgomery, who appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). On December 13, 2005, CAS found Montgomery guilty and imposed a two-year ban. On top of the ban, all of Montgomery&#x27;s results and awards since March 31, 2001, including his former world record, were also stripped. After the ban was made public, Montgomery announced his retirement. The investigation also implicated his former partner Marion Jones, winner of the women&#x27;s 100 meters at the 2000 Sydney Games.

On November 24, 2008, Montgomery admitted to taking testosterone and human growth hormone before the Sydney Games 4 × 100-meter relay, in which he helped claim the gold medal. After the admission an International Olympic Committee spokesperson said the committee would look into the matter as part of its open file on the BALCO investigation, but the United States team continues to be officially listed as the winner of the event and no action has been taken against teammates Jon Drummond, Bernard Williams, Brian Lewis, Maurice Greene, and Kenny Brokenburr.

==Money laundering charge==
In April 2006, Montgomery was indicted and arrested on fraud charges for his alleged involvement in a money laundering scheme. He was accused of depositing three bogus checks totaling $775,000. Montgomery allegedly received $20,000 for his participation. His former coach, Steve Riddick, was also a defendant in the case.

Riddick served a prison term of five years and three months. Marion Jones served a six-month prison term for lying to investigators about the check-fraud scam.

Montgomery pleaded guilty to the charges on April 9, 2007. He was sentenced to 46 months in prison on May 16, 2008.

==Heroin arrest==
On May 1, 2008, an indictment was unsealed that accused Montgomery of dealing more than 100 grams of heroin in the Hampton Roads area over the previous year, according to &quot;the Virginian-Pilot&quot;, the daily newspaper in Virginia Beach. Montgomery told the newspaper he knew nothing of the accusations and that his arrest was a &quot;total surprise.&quot;

In October 2008, Montgomery was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison.

== Personal life ==
Montgomery has four children with four different women. His son Tim Jr (June 2003) is with Marion Jones; his daughter Tymiah(2001) is a runner for University of Florida Gators. In October 2009 while imprisoned he married Jamalee Montgomery.

<text>The 1928 Summer Olympics (), officially the Games of the IX Olympiad (), was an international multi-sport event that was celebrated from 28 July to 12 August 1928 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The city of Amsterdam had previously bid for the 1920 and 1924 Olympic Games. Still, it was obliged to give way to war-torn Antwerp in Belgium for the 1920 Games and Pierre de Coubertin&#x27;s Paris for the 1924 Games.

The only other candidate city for the 1928 Olympics was Los Angeles, which would eventually be selected to host the Olympics four years later. In preparation for the 1932 Summer Olympics, the United States Olympic Committee reviewed the costs and revenue of the 1928 Games. The committee reported a total cost of US$1.183 million with receipts of US$1.165 million, giving a negligible loss of US$18,000, which was a considerable improvement over the 1924 Games.

The United States won the most gold and medals overall.

== Host city selection ==
Dutch nobleman Frederik van Tuyll van Serooskerken first proposed Amsterdam as the host city for the Summer Olympic Games in 1912, even before the Netherlands Olympic Committee was established.

The Olympic Games were canceled in 1916 due to World War I. In 1919, the Netherlands Olympic Committee abandoned the proposal of Amsterdam in favor of their support for the nomination of Antwerp as host city for the 1920 Summer Olympics. In 1921, Paris was selected for the 1924 Summer Olympics on the condition that the 1928 Summer Olympics would be organized in Amsterdam. This decision, supported by the Netherlands Olympic Committee, was announced by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on 2 June 1921.

Los Angeles&#x27; bid for the 1928 Summer Olympics was unsuccessful in 1922 and again in 1923. The city was eventually selected as host city for the 1932 Summer Olympics, being the only bidder for that year.

== Highlights ==

*These were the first Olympics to be organized under the IOC presidency of Henri de Baillet-Latour.
* A symbolic fire was lit for the first time during the Olympics, a tradition that continues today. The first Olympic flame and torch relay, however, would not take place until the 1936 Summer Olympics.
* For the first time, the parade of nations started with Greece, which holds the origins of the Olympics, and ended with the host country, a tradition that has continued ever since.
* The events were entirely funded through private donations with the government of the host nation providing no financial support for the first time.
* The Games were officially opened by Prince Hendrik, consort of Queen Wilhelmina, who had authorized her husband to deputize for her. The Queen was unable to attend the opening ceremony as she was on holiday in Norway and did not want to disrupt her trip. This was the second time a head of state had not personally officiated at an Olympic opening ceremony (the first occasion being the 1904 Games in St. Louis, Missouri, which were officially opened by David R. Francis, the Mayor of St. Louis). The Queen had initially refused to appear at either the opening or closing ceremony; it is thought that she objected to the Netherlands hosting the 1928 Games as she considered the Olympics a demonstration of paganism. However, she returned from Norway before the conclusion of the Games, to be present at the closing ceremony, and she presented the first prizes at the prize distribution which was held immediately beforehand.
* The American company Coca-Cola made its first appearance as an official sponsor of the Olympic Games, remaining the oldest Olympic sponsor to this day.
* Many cars were expected for the Games, but Amsterdam had at most 2,000 single-car parking spaces. Consequently, several new parking sites were provided, and a special parking symbol was launched to show foreign visitors where they could park. The white P on a blue background was to become the international traffic sign for parking, which is still used today.
* These Games were the first to bear the name &quot;Summer Olympic Games&quot;, to distinguish them from the Winter Olympic Games (held since 1924).
* These Games were the first to feature a fixed schedule of sixteen days, which is still followed since 1984. In previous Olympics, competition had been stretched out over several months.
* Athletics events were held on a 400-meter track, later becoming the standard for athletics tracks.
* Germany returned to the Olympic Games for the first time since 1912, after being banned from the 1920 and 1924 Games due to its role in World War I. The German team immediately finished second in the 1928 medal count.
* South American football made a definite breakthrough, as Uruguay retained its title by defeating Argentina.
* India took its first ever gold medal in field hockey, beginning a streak of six consecutive gold medals in the sport.

==Athlete highlights==
* Paavo Nurmi of Finland won his ninth, and final, gold medal in the 10,000 m race.
* Canadian athlete Percy Williams exceeded expectations by winning both the 100 m and 200 m sprint events.
* Crown Prince Olav, who would later become King of Norway, won a gold medal in the 6 meter sailing event.
* Pat O&#x27;Callaghan won the first ever medal for a newly independent Ireland, taking gold in the hammer throw.
* Mikio Oda of Japan won the triple jump event with a result of , becoming the first gold medalist from an Asian country.
* Betty Robinson of the USA won the women&#x27;s 100 metres in a world record time of 12.2 seconds. She was still just 16 years of age at the time. 
* Algerian-born marathon runner Boughera El Ouafi won a gold medal for France in the men&#x27;s marathon.
* Johnny Weissmuller, who later appeared in several Tarzan movies, won two gold medals in swimming: an individual gold in the men&#x27;s 100 m freestyle, and a team gold in the men&#x27;s 4 × 200 m freestyle relay.

== Sports ==
During the 1928 Summer Olympics, there were 14 sports, 20 disciplines and 109 events in the tournament. In parentheses is the number of events per discipline.
Women&#x27;s athletics and team gymnastics debuted at these Olympics, in spite of criticism. Five women&#x27;s athletics events were added: 100 meters, 800 meters, high jump, discus, and 400 meter hurdles. In protest of the limited number of events, British women athletes, boycotted the Games. Halina Konopacka of Poland became the first female Olympic track and field champion. Reports that the 800 meter run ended with several of the competitors being completely exhausted were widely (and erroneously) circulated. As a result, the IOC decided that women were too frail for long-distance running, and women&#x27;s Olympic running events were limited to 200 meters until the 1960s.

Tennis disappeared from the program until it reappeared in 1968 as a demonstration sport.

=== Demonstration sports ===
* Kaatsen (not considered official by the IOC)
* Korfball
* Lacrosse

These Games also included art competitions in five categories: architecture, painting, sculpture, literature, and music. However, the IOC no longer considers these to be official medal events, so the medals awarded are not included in today&#x27;s Olympic medal counts.

== Venues ==
Fourteen sports venues were used for the 1928 Summer Olympics. The Swim Stadium was demolished in 1929. The Het Kasteel football stadium was renovated in 1998–99. The Monnikenhuize stadium was demolished in 1950. The Schermzaal sports hall has also been demolished. The Olympic Stadium was renovated between 1996 and 2000, and is still in use. The Old Stadion was demolished in 1929 and replaced with housing in the Amsterdam area.

== Participating nations ==
A total of 46 nations were represented at the Amsterdam Games. Malta, Panama, and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) competed at the Olympic Games for the first time. Germany returned after having been banned in 1920 and 1924.

The nations that participated in the previous games in Paris 1924 but were absent in Amsterdam 1928 were Brazil and Ecuador.

At the time, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa and Ireland were all dominions of the British Empire. India and Rhodesia were also a part of the British Empire, but were not dominions. For other sovereign states (i.e. United States, France, Argentina, Japan, etc) and the international community as a whole (i.e League of Nations) the term dominion, used internally in the British Empire, was very ambiguous, meaning &quot;something between a colony and state&quot;. It was only years later with the Statute of Westminster 1931 that this ambiguity would be dispelled. Philippines was an unincorporated territory and commonwealth of the United States.

=== Number of athletes by National Olympic Committees ===

== Medal count ==

These are the top ten nations that won medals at the 1928 Games. 
== Poster ==
The official poster for the Games displaying a running man in a white shirt was designed by Jos Rovers however the IOC never succeeded in obtaining the copyright of the image. The IOC used a different poster, with the German text &quot;Olympische Spiele&quot;, and an athlete partly covered in the Dutch national flag, holding a peace leaf in his hand. The poster was made for a German book about the Amsterdam Olympics.

== Last surviving competitor ==
The last living competitor of the 1928 Summer Olympics was Carla Marangoni, a member of the silver medal-winning Italian gymnastic team who had been twelve years old during the Olympics. Marangoni died 18 January 2018, at the age of 102 as the oldest living Olympic medalist at the time of her death.

<text>Hu Gadarn (&quot;Hu the Mighty&quot;) is a supposed Welsh legendary figure who appears in several of a series of Welsh Triads produced by the Welsh antiquarian and literary forger Iolo Morganwg. These triads, which Iolo put forth as medieval works, present Hu as a culture hero of the ancient Britons who introduced ploughing. However, it is now known that the triads, like all of the so-called &quot;Third Series&quot; of triads, were fabricated by Iolo himself. The name &quot;Hu Gadarn&quot; earlier appeared in a Welsh translation of a French romance about Charlemagne. Still, Iolo&#x27;s version of Hu Gadarn was taken up in the 20th century by the poet Robert Graves, who associated him with other Celtic figures; since then he has been popular among neopagans.

==Origins==
The name Hu Gadarn first appears in &quot;Pererindod Siarlymaen&quot;, a Welsh adaptation of the 12th-century French romance &quot;Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne&quot; (&quot;The Pilgrimage of Charlemagne&quot;). In this story, part of the literary cycle known as the Matter of France, Hu Gadarn (&quot;Hugo&quot; or &quot;Hugun le Fort&quot; in the French) is Emperor of Constantinople and an enemy of Siarlymaen (Charlemagne). After Siarlymaen&#x27;s wife tells him his valor is overshadowed by Hu&#x27;s, Siarlymaen sets off on a pilgrimage to find the emperor in Constantinople. With the aid of his knights, he bests his adversary and returns to his wife triumphant.

The story, which may have precedents in Celtic literature, specifically associates Hu with ploughing, a detail later picked up by Iolo Morganwg. Hu Gadarn is mentioned metaphorically in Iolo Goch&#x27;s (fl. 14th century) poem &quot;Y Llafurwr&quot;, on the ploughman, suggesting the poet knew some version of the story. Other early references to &quot;Hu Gadarn&quot; have been cited in poems by Rhys Brydydd and Llywelyn ab y Moel, both of whom associated him with semi-divine attributes during the 15th century.

==Iolo Morganwg and later use==
Seven of Iolo Morganwg&#x27;s &quot;Third Series&quot; of triads mention Hu Gadarn. Here, Hu is presented as a culture hero who leads the ancient Britons to Britain from their previous home in &quot;Deffrobani&quot;, glossed as &quot;Summerland&quot;, and said to be situated &quot;where Constantinople is now&quot; (though the name has also been identified as a Welsh form of &quot;Taprobana&quot;). He becomes their first king, teaches them to plough, and creates song to strengthen memory and record. He uses a yoke, which he invents, to pull a flood-causing monster named the &quot;afanc&quot; out of the water.

Iolo&#x27;s &quot;Third Series&quot; of triads were initially accepted as authentic, and were published in the influential collection known as &quot;The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales&quot;. However, they are now known to be forgeries created by Iolo himself. Iolo wrote further about Hu in his &quot;Barddas&quot;, supposedly an ancient collection of bardic lore, where he identifies Hu with the Gaulish god Esus and with Jesus. The 20th-century English author Robert Graves accepted Iolo&#x27;s version of Hu Gadarn (and much of the rest of his work), and further identified Hu as a Welsh horned god, a variant of Cernunnos. In Graves&#x27; wake, Hu Gadarn has become a popular figure among Neopagans.

<text>Cessair or Cesair (, meaning &#x27;sorrow, affliction&#x27;) is a character from a medieval Irish origin myth, best known from the 11th-century chronicle text &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;. According to the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;, she was the leader of the first inhabitants of Ireland, arriving before the Biblical flood. The tale may have been an attempt to Christianise an earlier pagan myth.

==Overview==
According to the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;, Cessair was the daughter of Noah&#x27;s non-Biblical son Bith and his wife Birren. Cessair&#x27;s father&#x27;s name, &#x27;Bith&#x27;, is derived from the proto-Celtic &quot;Bitu&quot;-, which can mean &quot;world&quot;, &quot;life&quot;, or &quot;age&quot; (cf. Bituitus).

In some versions of the tale, Noah tells them to go to the western edge of the world to escape the coming flood. In other versions, after being denied a place on Noah&#x27;s Ark, Cessair tells her people to create an idol to advise them. This idol tells them to escape the flood by sailing to Ireland. They set out in three ships and reach Ireland after a long journey. However, when they attempt to land, two of the ships are lost. The only survivors are Cessair, forty-nine other women, and three men: Fintan mac Bóchra, Bith, and Ladra.

According to the Annals of the Four Masters, they landed in Ireland at on Bantry Bay forty days before the flood, in Age of the World 2242. According to Seathrún Céitinn&#x27;s chronology, they arrived in 2361 BC.

The tale continues with the women being shared evenly among the men. Each man had one woman as his primary wife: Fintán with Cessair, Bith with Bairrfhind, Ladra with Alba. Bith and Ladra soon die, and Fintán is left with all of the women. However, he is unable to cope and flees to a cave in the mountains. Fintán is the only survivor when the Flood eventually comes. He shapeshifts into a one-eyed salmon, then an eagle, and then finally a hawk. He lives for 5,500 years after the flood, becomes a man again, and recounts Ireland&#x27;s history to the High King Diarmait mac Cerbaill. Fintán is thus similar to the character Tuan mac Cairill.

According to legend, Cessair died at in Connacht and a cairn, , was raised over her body. It has been speculated that this cairn is near Boyle in County Roscommon, or that it is Cnoc Meadha in County Galway.

== Other versions ==
Archaeologist J. P. Mallory has a different version of the tale, in which there are 150 women and three men. The first man dies and is buried in Wexford. The second man then has 100 women and soon dies of exhaustion. The 150 women chase the remaining man, who saves himself by jumping into the sea and turning into a salmon.

An earlier version of the tale, allegedly found in the &quot;Cín Dromma Snechtai&quot;, says that the first woman in Ireland was Banba. She arrived with her two sisters, Fódla and Ériu, three men, and fifty women. Banba, Fódla, and Ériu were a trio of Irish land goddesses. Their husbands were Mac Cuill (son of hazel), Mac Cecht (son of the plow), and Mac Gréine (son of the Sun), respectively. It is likely that Cessair, Bairrfhind, and Alba are Christianized replacements for the three goddesses and that Fintán, Bith, and Ladra are replacements for the three gods. Fintán/Mac Cuill may also be linked to the Salmon of Knowledge, which gains all the world&#x27;s knowledge after eating nine hazelnuts that fell into a well. The women who accompany Cessair appear by their names to represent the world&#x27;s ancestral mothers. They included &#x27;Alba&#x27; (British), &#x27;German&#x27; (Germans), &#x27;Espa&#x27; (Spanish), &#x27;Triage&#x27; (Thracians), &#x27;Gothiam&#x27; (Goths), and so forth. Thus &quot;their arrival can be read as creating a microcosm of the whole world&#x27;s population in Ireland&quot;. Several other companions echo the names of ancient Irish goddesses.

Seathrún Céitinn also refers to a legend in which three fishermen from Iberia—Capa, Lavigne, and Luasad—were driven to Ireland by a storm a year before the flood. They liked Ireland and returned home to collect their wives. They returned shortly before the flood and were drowned.

According to another medieval Irish legend, Cessair is also the name of the King of Gallia&#x27;s daughter. She married the High King of Ireland, Úgaine Mór, in either the 5th or 6th century BC.

<text>The Fomorians or Fomori (, Modern ) are a supernatural race in Irish mythology, who are often portrayed as hostile and monstrous beings. Originally they were said to come from under the sea or the earth. Later, they were portrayed as sea raiders and giants. They are enemies of Ireland&#x27;s first settlers and opponents of the Tuatha Dé Danann, the other supernatural race in Irish mythology; although some members of the two races have offspring. The Tuath Dé defeat the Fomorians in the &quot;Battle of Mag Tuired&quot;. This has been likened to other Indo-European myths of a war between gods, such as the Æsir and Vanir in Norse mythology, the Olympians and Titans in Greek mythology, and the Devas and Asuras in Indian mythology.

One theory is that the Fomorians were supernatural beings representing the wild or destructive powers of nature; personifications of chaos, darkness, death, blight and drought.

==Name==
In Old and Middle Irish, the race is usually called the &quot;Fomóire&quot; or &quot;Fomóiri&quot; (plural), and an individual member is called a &quot;Fomóir&quot; (singular). In Middle Irish, they are also called the &quot;Fomóraiġ&quot; (plural) and a &quot;Fomórach&quot; (singular). This is spelt &quot;Fomhóraigh/Fomóraigh&quot; (plural) and &quot;Fomhórach&quot; (singular) in Modern Irish. Their name is Latinized as &quot;Muiridi&quot; in the &quot;Lebor Bretnach&quot;. In English, they are called the Fomorians, Fomori or Fomors.

The etymology of the name is debated. The first part is generally agreed to be the Old Irish &quot;fo&quot;, meaning under, below, lower, beneath, nether, etc. The meaning of the second part is unclear. One suggestion is that it comes from Old Irish &quot;mur&quot; (sea), and that the name means something like &quot;the undersea ones&quot;. This was the interpretation offered by some medieval Irish writers. Another suggestion is that it comes from &quot;mór&quot; (great/big) and means something like &quot;the great under(world) ones&quot;, &quot;the under(world) giants&quot; or &quot;the nether giants&quot;. A third suggestion, which has more support among scholars, is that it comes from a hypothetical Old Irish term for a demon or phantom, found in the name of The Morrígan and cognate with the archaic English word &quot;mare&quot; (which survives in &quot;nightmare&quot;). The name would thus mean something like &quot;underworld demons/phantoms&quot; or &quot;nether demons/phantoms&quot;. Building on this, Marie-Louise Sjoestedt interprets the name as meaning &quot;inferior&quot; or &quot;latent demons&quot;, saying the Fomorians are &quot;like the powers of chaos, ever latent and hostile to cosmic order&quot;. John T. Koch suggests a relationship with Tartessian &quot;omuŕik&quot;.

==Description==
Originally the Fomorians seem to have been regarded as malevolent spirits dwelling underwater and in the nether regions of the earth. In one of the earliest references to them, a probably 7th-century elegy for Mess-Telmann, they are said to dwell &quot;under the worlds of men&quot;. Later they were portrayed as sea raiders. This was influenced by the Viking raids on Ireland that were taking place around that time.

They are often portrayed as monstrous. Sometimes they are said to have the body of a man and the head of a goat, according to an 11th-century text in &quot;Lebor na hUidre&quot; (the Book of the Dun Cow), or to have had one eye, one arm and one leg. However, those Fomorians who have relationships with the Tuath Dé, such as Elatha and his son Bres, were portrayed as darkly beautiful.

The Fomorians are the enemies of Ireland&#x27;s first settlers and of the supernatural Tuath Dé, with whom they are contrasted. However, in some sources there is an overlap between the Fomorians and Tuath Dé. A figure called Tethra is named as presiding over both races.

The conflict between the Tuath Dé and Fomorians has been likened to other Indo-European myths of a war between gods: between Æsir and Vanir in Norse mythology, between Olympians and Titans in Greek mythology, and between Devas and Asuras in Vedic mythology. Dáithí Ó hÓgáin writes that the Tuath Dé gaining agricultural knowledge from the Fomorians is similar to the Norse and Vedic versions, where the defeated races represent the fertility of the soil.

==Myths==

The medieval myth of Partholón says that his followers were the first to invade Ireland after the flood, but the Fomorians were already there: Geoffrey Keating reports a tradition that the Fomorians, led by Cichol Gricenchos, had arrived two hundred years earlier and lived on fish and fowl until Partholon came (this detail only appears in the 3rd Redaction of the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn)&quot;, bringing the plough and oxen. Partholon defeated Cíocal in the Battle of Mag Itha, but all his people later died of plague.

Then came Nemed and his followers. Ireland is said to have been empty for thirty years following the death of Partholon&#x27;s people, but Nemed and his followers encountered the Fomorians when they arrived. At this point, Céitinn reports another tradition that the Fomorians were seafarers from the Middle East, descended from Ham, son of Noah. Nemed defeated them in several battles, killing their kings Gann and Sengann, but two new Fomorian leaders arose: Conand son of Faebar, who lived in Conand&#x27;s Tower on Tory Island, County Donegal, and Morc son of Dela (note that the first generation of the Fir Bolg were also said to be sons of Dela).

After Nemed&#x27;s death, Conand and Morc enslaved his people and demanded a heavy tribute: two thirds of their children, grain and cattle. Nemed&#x27;s son Fergus Lethderg gathered an army of sixty thousand, rose up against them and destroyed Conand&#x27;s Tower, but Morc attacked them with a huge fleet, and there was great slaughter on both sides. The sea rose over them and drowned most of the survivors: only thirty of Nemed&#x27;s people escaped in a single ship, scattering to the other parts of the world. The next invasion was by the Fir Bolg, who did not encounter the Fomorians.

Next, the Tuatha Dé Danann, who are usually supposed to have been the gods of the Goidelic Irish, defeated the Fir Bolg in the first Battle of Mag Tuired and took possession of Ireland. Because their king, Nuada Airgetlám, had lost an arm in the battle and was no longer physically whole, their first king in Ireland was the half-Fomorian Bres. He was the result of a union between Ériu of the Tuatha Dé Danann and the Fomorian prince Elatha, who had come to her one night by sea on a silver boat. Both Elatha and Bres are described as very beautiful. However Bres turned out to be a bad king who forced the Tuatha Dé to work as slaves and pay tribute to the Fomorians. He lost authority when he was satirised for neglecting his kingly duties of hospitality. Nuada was restored to the kingship after his arm was replaced with a working one of silver, but the Tuatha Dé&#x27;s oppression by the Fomorians continued.

Bres fled to his father, Elatha, and asked for his help to restore him to the kingship. Elatha refused, on the grounds that he should not seek to gain by foul means what he couldn&#x27;t keep by fair. Bres instead turned to Balor, a more warlike Fomorian chief living on Tory Island, and raised an army.

The Tuatha Dé Danann also prepared for war, under another half-Fomorian leader, Lug. His father was Cian of the Tuatha Dé, and his mother was Balor&#x27;s daughter Ethniu. This is presented as a dynastic marriage in early texts, but folklore preserves a more elaborate story, reminiscent of the story of Perseus from Greek mythology. Balor, who had been given a prophecy that he would be killed by his own grandson, locked Ethniu in a glass tower to keep her away from men. But when he stole Cian&#x27;s magical cow, Cian got his revenge by gaining entry to the tower, with the help of a druidess called Biróg, and seducing her. She gave birth to triplets, which Balor ordered drowned. Two of the babies either died or turned into the first seals, but Biróg saved one, Lug, and gave him to Manannán and Tailtiu to foster. As an adult, Lug gained entry to Nuada&#x27;s court through his mastery of every art, and was given command over the army.

The second Battle of Mag Tuired was fought between the Fomorians under Balor and the Tuatha Dé under Lug. When the two forces met on the field of battle, it was said that to attack the fierce Fomorian flank was like striking a head against a cliff, placing a hand into a serpent&#x27;s nest, or facing up to fire. Balor killed Nuada with his terrible, poisonous eye that killed all it looked upon. Lug faced his grandfather, but as he was opening his eye Lug shot a sling-stone that drove his eye out the back of his head, wreaking havoc on the Fomorian army behind. After Balor&#x27;s death the Fomorians were defeated and driven into the sea.

According to the Irish version of the &quot;Historia Britonum of Nennius&quot;, the Fomorians are referred to as mariners who were forced into a tower near the sea by the Tuatha Dé Danann. Then the Irish or otherwise descendants of Nemed with Fergus red-side at the lead, pushed all the Fomorians into the sea, with the exception of one ship that survived.

===&quot;The Training of Cú Chulainn&quot;===
The Fomorians were still around at the time of Cú Chulainn. In the medieval Irish tale entitled &quot;The Training of Cú Chulainn&quot;, preserved as a copy by Richard Tipper in British Library, Egerton MS 106, it gives the following mention:

In later times, any settled pirates or seaborne raiders were labelled Fomorians and the original meaning of the word was forgotten.

<doc id="86234" wikidata="Q27429" url="?curid=86234" title="Nemed">
<text>Nemed or Nimeth () is a character in medieval Irish legend. According to the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; (compiled in the 11th century), he was the leader of the third group of people to settle in Ireland: the &quot;Muintir Nemid&quot; (or &quot;Muintir Neimhidh&quot;, &quot;people of Nemed&quot;), &quot;Clann Nemid&quot; (&quot;Clann Neimhidh&quot;, &quot;offspring of Nemed&quot;) or &quot;Nemedians&quot;. They arrived thirty years after the Muintir Partholóin, their predecessors, had died out. Nemed eventually dies of plague and his people are oppressed by the Fomorians. They rise up against the Fomorians, attacking their tower out at sea, but most are killed and the survivors leave Ireland. Their descendants become the Fir Bolg.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;nemed&quot; means &quot;privileged&quot; or &quot;holy&quot; in Old Irish, and &quot;seems to have been a designation of a druid&quot;. The reconstructed Proto-Celtic language root &quot;nemos&quot; means &quot;sky&quot; or &quot;heaven&quot;. In the ancient Celtic religions a nemeton was a place of worship (which included temples, shrines and sacred natural places). Similar roots are found in place names across Celtic culture. For example, there was a Nemetes tribe of the central Rhine area, who had a goddess Nemetona.

== Legend ==
According to the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;, Nemed, like those who settled Ireland before him, had a genealogy going back to the Biblical Noah. Nemed was the son of Agnoman of Scythia, the son of Piamp, son of Tait, son of Sera, son of Sru, son of Esru, son of Friamaint, son of Jobhath, son of Magog, son of Japheth, one of the sons of Noah.

Ireland had been uninhabited since the Muintir Partholóin died of plague. The Muintir Nemid set sail from the Caspian Sea in 44 ships, but after a year and a half of sailing, the only ship to reach Ireland is Nemed&#x27;s. In one version, the fleet come upon a tower of gold in the sea. They try to take the tower, but all the ships except Nemed&#x27;s are wrecked by the waves. Also on board are his wife Macha, his four chieftain sons (Starn, Iarbonel, Annind, and Fergus &#x27;Red-Side&#x27;), their wives and others.

His wife Macha dies twelve days after they arrived and is buried at &quot;Ard Mhacha&quot; (Armagh). Two quite different dates are given for the arrival of Muintir Nemid: 2350 BCE, according to the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;; or 1731 BCE in Seathrún Céitinn&#x27;s chronology.

Four lakes burst from the ground in Nemed&#x27;s time, including Loch Annind, which flowed up when Annind&#x27;s grave was being dug. The other three lakes are Loch Cál in Uí Nialláin, Loch Munremair in Luigne, and Loch Dairbrech in Mide.

The Muintir Nemid clear twelve plains: Mag Cera, Mag Eba, Mag Cuile Tolaid and Mag Luirg in Connacht; Mag Seired in Tethbae; Mag Tochair in Tír Eoghain; Mag Selmne in Dál nAraidi; Mag Macha in Airgíalla; Mag Muirthemne in Brega; Mag Bernsa in Leinster; Leccmag and Mag Moda in Munster.

They also build two royal forts: Ráth Chimbaith in Semne and Ráth Chindeich in Uí Nialláin. Ráth Chindeich was dug in one day by Boc, Roboc, Ruibne, and Rotan, the four sons of Matan Munremar. Nemed kills them before dawn the next morning.

Nemed wins four battles against the mysterious Fomorians (Fomoire). Modern scholars believe the Fomorians were a group of deities who represent the harmful or destructive powers of nature: personifications of chaos, darkness, death, blight, and drought. These battles are at Ros Fraechain (in which Fomorian kings Gann and Sengann are killed), at Badbgna in Connacht, at Cnamros in Leinster (in which Artur, Nemed&#x27;s first son born in Ireland, dies), and at Murbolg in Dál Riata (where his son Starn is killed by the Fomorian Conand).

However, nine years after arriving in Ireland, Nemed dies of plague, along with three thousand of his people. He is buried on the hill of &quot;Ard Nemid&quot; on Great Island in Cork Harbour.

The remaining Muintir Nemid are oppressed by the Fomorians Morc and Conand, who lives in Conand&#x27;s Tower, on an island off the coast. Each Samhain, the Nemedians must give two thirds of their children, their corn and their milk to the Fomorians. This tribute may be &quot;a dim memory of sacrifice offered at the beginning of winter, when the powers of darkness and blight are in the ascendant&quot;. After many years, the Muintir Nemid rise up against the Fomorians and attack Conand&#x27;s Tower with 60,000 warriors (30,000 on sea and 30,000 on land), defeating Conand. Morc then attacks, and almost all of the Nemedians are either killed in the fighting or swept away by the sea. Only one ship of thirty men escapes.

Some of the survivors go &quot;into the north of the world&quot; and become the Tuatha Dé Danann, some go to Britain and become the ancestors of all Britons, and some go south to Greece and become the Fir Bolg. The island would be empty for another 200 years.

The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;—which is earlier than the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;—says there were only three settlements of Ireland, with the Nemedians being the second. It says that the Nemedians came from Iberia and stayed in Ireland for many years, but returned to Iberia and the continent. The &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; says that there were six settlements and classifies the Nemedians as the third group. The number may have been increased to six to match the &quot;Six Ages of the World&quot;.

Irish mythology mentions another Nemed, namely &quot;Nemed mac Nama,&quot; who may or may not be the same as the Nemed mentioned in the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;. This Nemed is described as a famous warrior king who raised two horses with the Fairy Folk of Síd Ercmon. When the horses were released from the Síd, a stream called &quot;Uanob&quot; (&quot;Foam River&quot;) or &quot;Oin Aub&quot; chased them from the Síd and released foam over the entire land for a year. Cúchulainn later referred to this river thus: &quot;Over the foam of the two horses of Emain am I come&quot;.

==Analysis==
Dáithí Ó hÓgáin writes that Nemed himself &quot;is probably drawn from genuine tradition&quot; and that his name (and his wife&#x27;s name) suggests &quot;he originally belonged to the context of the divine pantheon known as the Tuatha Dé Danann&quot;. He notes that the clash between the Nemedians and Fomorians echoes the primordial clash between the Tuath Dé and Fomorians, commenting that &quot;the medieval scholars were more concerned with devising a chronological pseudo-history than with avoiding duplication&quot;.

In one version of the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;, the Nemedians are drowned while trying to take a golden tower at sea, while in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; it is the Milesians who attack a glass tower at sea. The Nemedians later battle the Fomorians at a tower by the sea, while the Tuath Dé battle the Fomorians at a place called the &quot;plain of towers&quot; or &quot;plain of pillars&quot; (the &quot;Battle of Mag Tuired&quot;).

<text>In medieval Irish myth, the Fir Bolg (also spelt Firbolg and Fir Bholg) are the fourth group of people to settle in Ireland. They are descended from the Muintir Nemid, an earlier group who abandoned Ireland and went to different parts of Europe. Those who went to Greece became the Fir Bolg and eventually return to Ireland, after it had been uninhabited for many years. After ruling it for some time and dividing the island into provinces, they are overthrown by the invading Tuatha Dé Danann.

== Myth == 
&quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; tells of Ireland being settled six times by six groups of people. The first three—the people of Cessair, the people of Partholón, and the people of Nemed—were wiped out or forced to abandon the island. The Fir Bolg are said to be descendants of the people of Nemed, who inhabited Ireland before them. All but thirty of Nemed&#x27;s people were killed in warfare and disaster. Of this thirty, one group flees &quot;into the north of the world&quot;, one group flees to Britain, and another group flees to Greece. Those who went into the north became the Tuatha Dé Danann (or Tuath Dé), the main pagan gods of Ireland.

Those who went to Greece became the Fir Bolg. &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; says that they were enslaved by the Greeks and made to carry bags of soil or clay, hence the name &#x27;Fir Bolg&#x27; (men of bags). The &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot; says that they were forced to settle on poor, rocky land but that they made it into fertile fields by dumping great amounts of soil on it. After 230 years, they leave Greece at the same time as the Israelites escaped from Egypt. In a great fleet, the Fir Bolg sail to Iberia and then to Ireland.

Led by their five chieftains, they divide Ireland into five provinces: Gann takes North Munster, Sengann takes South Munster, Genann takes Connacht, Rudraige takes Ulster, and Slánga takes Leinster. They establish the High Kingship and a succession of nine High Kings rules over Ireland for the next 37 years. The seat of the high-kings is established at Tara, a site with significance through Medieval times as a source of religious and royal power. The last High King, Eochaid mac Eirc, is the example of a perfect king. The Fir Bolg are also said to have included two sub-groups known as the Fir Domnann and Fir Gáilióin.

After 37 years, the Tuath Dé arrive in Ireland. Their king, Nuada, asks to be given half the island, but the Fir Bolg king Eochaid refuses. The two groups meet at the Pass of Balgatan, and the ensuing battle—the First Battle of Mag Tuired—lasts for four days. During the battle, Sreng, the champion of the Fir Bolg, challenges Nuada to single combat. With one sweep of his sword, Sreng cuts off Nuada&#x27;s right hand. However, the Fir Bolg are defeated and their king, Eochaid, is slain by the three sons of Nemid. Sreng saves them from total destruction, however. According to some texts, the Fir Bolg flee Ireland. According to others, the Tuath Dé offer them one quarter of Ireland as their own, and they choose Connacht. They are mentioned very little after this in the myths.

The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;—which was written earlier than the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;—says there were only three settlements of Ireland: the people of Partholón, the people of Nemed, and the Gaels. However, it mentions that a leader called &quot;Builc&quot; or &quot;Builg&quot; and his followers had taken an island called Eubonia, believed to be the Isle of Man. The &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; adds the Fir Bolg into the scheme and increases the number of settlements to six. It has been suggested that this number was chosen to match the &quot;Six Ages of the World&quot;.



== Analysis ==
Today, most scholars regard the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; as myth rather than history. It is believed the goal of its writers was to provide an epic origin story for the Irish, like that of the Israelites, which reconciled native myth with the Christian view of history. Ireland&#x27;s inhabitants (in this case the Fir Bolg) are likened to the Israelites by escaping from slavery and making a great journey to a &#x27;Promised Land&#x27;. The pagan gods (the Tuath Dé) are depicted as a group of people with powers of sorcery.

The name &quot;Fir Bolg&quot; is usually translated in the early literature as &quot;men of bags&quot;. The Irish word &quot;fir&quot; means &quot;men&quot; and the word &quot;bolg/bolc&quot; can mean a belly, bag, sack, bellows, and so forth. Kuno Meyer and R. A. Stewart Macalister argue that the name comes from the term &quot;Fir i mBolgaib&quot;, meaning &quot;breeches wearers&quot;, literally &quot;men in (baggy) breeches&quot;, which could be interpreted as a term of contempt for the &quot;lower orders&quot;. Macalister suggests this expression had fallen out of use by the time the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; was written, and the writers tried to make sense of it by creating a story about men with bags. It has also been suggested that it originally meant men who were &quot;bulging&quot; or &quot;swollen&quot; with battle fury.

The name may be based on, and cognate with, &quot;Belgae&quot;. The Belgae were a group of tribes living in northern Gaul. Some have suggested that the writers named a fictional race, the Fir Bolg, after a real group, the Belgae. T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly suggested that Fir Bolg, or Builg, was another name for the Érainn. He believed they were linked to the Belgae and settled Ireland around the 5th century BC. O&#x27;Rahilly&#x27;s theory has been challenged by historians and archaeologists, and is no longer accepted.

John Rhys and R. A. Stewart Macalister suggest that the Fir Bolg are the Fomorians (Fomoire) under another guise. Macalister notes that the Fir Bolg are the only group of settlers who are not harried by the Fomorians. The Tuath Dé fight two similar battles at Mag Tuired, one against the human Fir Bolg and one against the supernatural Fomorians. The Fir Bolg lead the Fomorians to the second battle. The Fomorians seem to have represented the harmful or destructive powers of nature, while the Tuath Dé represented the gods of growth and civilization.

<text>In Irish mythology, Clíodhna (Clídna, Clionadh, Clíodna, Clíona, transliterated to Cleena in English) is a Queen of the Banshees of the Tuatha Dé Danann. Clíodna of Carrigcleena is the potent banshee that rules as queen over the &quot;sióga&quot; (fairies) of South Munster, or Desmond.

In some Irish myths, Clíodhna is a goddess of love and beauty, and the patron of County Cork. She is said to have three brightly coloured birds who eat apples from an otherworldly tree and whose sweet song heals sickness. 

She had her palace in the heart of a pile of rocks, from Mallow, which is still commonly known by the name of Carrig-Cleena, and numerous legends about her are told above the Munster peasantry who considered her their benefactor.

==Associated families and legends==
In general, it has been observed that Clíona is especially associated with old Irish families of Munster. Clíona has long been associated with the lands that had been the territory of the Ui-Fidgheinte (O&#x27;Donovans and O&#x27;Collins) during their period of influence (circa 373 A.D. to 977 A.D.), or were later associated with what had been the Ui-Fidghente territory (MacCarthys and FitzGeralds).

Clíodhna is also associated with the MacCarthy dynasty of Desmond, who adopted her as their fairy woman, and the O&#x27;Keeffes and FitzGerald dynasty, with whom she has had amorous affairs

Surviving traditions of Clíodhna in narrative and poetry associate her with the O&#x27;Keeffes (Ó Caoimh or Keefer) and O&#x27;Donovans. The latter, originally from Uí Fidgenti in North Munster with its own traditions, where their original goddess was Mongfind, later moved south to Carbery on Cuan Dor Harbour, Clíodhna&#x27;s traditional abode on the South Munster coast, and she then features in poetry associated with them. The O&#x27;Keeffe narrative tradition is more extensive, and Clíodhna has other Desmond associations too.

Irish revolutionary Michael Collins also had knowledge of Clíodhna. Stories were told of her in the Rosscarbery school he attended, and they took Sunday trips to Clíodhna&#x27;s rock. Collins was descended from the Ó Coileáins of Uí Chonaill Gabra. Both the Ui Chonaill and the Ui Donnobhans were tribes within the Ui-Fidghente.

===Cleena&#x27;s Wave===

This legend is recorded in Acallam na Senórach (&quot;Colloquy of the Ancients&quot;), longest-surviving work of medieval Irish literature. During the time of the Fianna lived Ciabham of the Curling Hair, son of the King of Ulster. Ciabham decided to leave Ireland by currach (boat) but encountered great white waves as big as mountains. He was saved from the sea by a rider on a dark grey horse with a golden bridle. They then reached Tír Tairngire (&quot;the land of promise&quot;), an otherworldly land ruled by Manannan their king. Ciabham is entertained at a feast within Manannan&#x27;s city. The chief druid Gebann had a daughter named Cleena of the Fair Hair. When she saw Caibhan, she falls in love with him and agreed to leave with him the next day. 

Together they sailed to Teite&#x27;s Strand in Ireland. Ciabhan went on shore to hunt and left Cleena in the boat. However, the people of Manannan pursued them in ships. One of them treacherously played music which causes Cleena to fall asleep. Then a great wave came and swept her away. The place was then called Tonn Chlíodhna, &quot;Clíodhna&#x27;s Wave&quot;, which is near Glandore harbour. Whether she drowns or not depends on the version being told, along with many other details of the story.

===The Voyage of Teigue, Son of Cian===

The Book of Lismore tells that Teigue was the son and heir of Cian, the king of West Munster. During a raid by an enemy from a far off land, many of their people were abducted and enslaved. Teigue and his warriors set out to rescue them. After rowing for nine weeks, they arrived in a strange land called &quot;Inis Derglocha&quot; (Red loch island). There Teigue meets a number of luminaries from Ireland&#x27;s mythical past. The final person they encounter introduces herself as &quot;Cleena Fairhead, daughter of Genann mac Treon of the &quot;tuatha dé Danann&quot;, sweetheart of Eochaid Redweapon&#x27;s son Ciabhan of the curling locks; for now some time I am in this island, and from me &#x27;Cleena&#x27;s Wave&#x27; in the borders of Munster is denominated&quot;. She gives them three birds to guide them and provide music, as well as an emerald cup that transforms water into wine. She warns that if Teigue is parted from the cup, he will die soon after.

Teigue and his warriors depart the island and after rescuing their kinsmen, they return home victorious.

===The legend of O&#x27;Keeffe, the Druid and his two daughters===

In the early eighth century, in Feur-magh-Feine (now Fermoy) there lived Draoi Ruadh, the last of the Druids. He had assisted the King of Munster by summoned a great storm to drive back their enemies. As a reward for his service, the king had grant the Druid the title Prince of Fermoy. The Druid had two accomplished and beautiful daughters: the elder was called Cleena who could transform creatures to any form she pleased and was titled &quot;the queen of the fairies&quot;. The younger daughter was called Aoivil (Aibell) and was her inseparable companion.

Caiov (O&#x27;Keeffe) was a prince accomplished in mind and body, who had inherited a neighboring territory. He was in the habit of visiting the Druid&#x27;s palace and liked to join in the sports in which he was often victorious. This attracted the admiration of the Druid and his daughters. Both sisters fell in love with O&#x27;Keeffe. Cleena expressed her love openly and discussions began with her father for their marriage.
Aoivil secretly fell in love and worked to gain his affection by her innocent arts. Caiov fell deeply in love with Aoivil but this was quickly discovered by Cleena. 

Because of her jealousy, Cleena called on the oldest of her nurses to curse her innocent sister. Aoivil was stricken with sickness and the loss of her beauty. Cleena pretended to help her by a powerful sleep mixture, which caused Aoivil&#x27;s apparent death. Aoivil was laid in a coffin and displayed before the Druid and his wife, who were filled with profound sorrow. She was then laid to rest in a tomb under the palace. Cleena and the nurse entered the tomb by a secret entrance and moved the still unconscious Aoivil to the cave at Castlecor ( north-east of Kanturk). When revived, Aoivil was told she would be imprisoned there until she forgot about Caiov. Cleena, seeing it may be impossible to make Aoivil forget, and in a fit of jealousy, she transformed Aoivil into a beautiful white cat. Cleena magically changed the cave into a palace, so her sister may bear her suffering more easily. The cave at Castlecor was said to be filled with treasures of gold and silver, watched over by a white cat that sat on a throne. Cleena told Aoivil that Caiov had fallen in battle with the Danes but Aoivil remained in love with him. For the space of one week a year at midsummer, Aoivil transformed back to her true form. Visitors to the cave sometimes saw the cat residing in the palace surrounded by treasure but were forced out by a mighty wind or invisible force.

When Caiov heard of her supposed death, he was filled with sorrow. The Druid and his wife were overcome with grief and brought them to an untimely grave. After due time, Caiov and Cleena were married with much rejoicing. Together they had three children and lived in happiness. However, the old nurse fell dangerously ill and her conscience forced her to confess everything to Caiov. The prince went to Cleena but she refused to release her sister. Cleena admitted she was unable to return her sister to her true form as she had lost her precious wand. This caused an irreconcilable division between Caiov and Cleena and after some time she retired to her fairy palace at Carrigcleena. Caiov would often come to ask forgiveness and for the release of Aoivil. Cleena remained unable to lift the enchantment but it is said that if one were to come that truly loved Aoivil more than her treasures, the enchantment would be lifted. Cleena still visits Aoivil and while Aoivil briefly resumes her human form, sisters are happy together.

===The legend of Ellen O&#x27;Brien and Fiz-Gerald===

Fiz-Gerald was a youthful chieftain who lived by the banks of the Shannon, County Limerick. He was widely known to be brave, hospitable and generous, as well as an accomplished harp player.

Ellen O&#x27;Brien was the only daughter from a chief who&#x27;s power had crumbled under the Saxon invasion. Fitz-Gerald loved her and stole her heart with his harp playing.

Cleena also desired Fiz-Gerald and resolved to bring him to her unseen hall. On a festival day, a dark cloud descended, enveloped Fiz-Gerald and carried him away. For months, no trace of him could be found and it was generally believed he was taken by enchantment. None felt greater sorry than Ellen O&#x27;Brien, who sought the help of a wizard that lived in Kerry who communed with beings from the other world.
The wizard told her that Fiz-Gerald had been taken to Cleena&#x27;s favorite residence at Carrigcleena. Ellen travelled to that place and pleaded in poetry for Cleena to release her lover. She also appealed to Cleena&#x27;s kindness and pledged to die at the foot of the rock if she was denied. Cleena was moved by Ellen&#x27;s plea and released Fitz-Gerald. They departed and were married and afterward had many happy children.

===The legend of John Fitzjames and Isabel Butler===

In 1736, the wedding of John Fitzjames (Fitzgerald) and Isabel Butler was held. As the wedding was nearing its end, dancing and feasting was underway. Then, as if struck by lightning, John dropped dead at Isabel&#x27;s feet. All in attendance were shocked and it was generally believed he had been transported in spirit to Fairyland.

Friends and associates of the couple attempted to make contact with Fairies to try to bring him back. Caitileen Dubh Keating and her daughter Caitileen Oge traveled to Carrigcleana to contact Cleena. They covered their clothes in tar and roll themselves in feathers of different colors. They saw Cleena face-to-face and the demanded the return of John but Cleena firmly refused, saying she would keep him for herself. While there are a number of versions of the story, Robert D. Joyce&#x27;s poem has a happy ending with Cleena releasing the groom named Gerald Fitzgerald, Earl of Desmond. In one version, Caitileen Oge was the bride.

===The Blarney Stone===

The most traditional story of the famous Blarney Stone involves Clíodhna. Cormac Laidir MacCarthy, the builder of Blarney Castle, being involved in a lawsuit, appealed to Clíodhna for her assistance. She told him to kiss the first stone he found in the morning on his way to court, and he did so, with the result that he pleaded his case with great eloquence and won. Thus the Blarney Stone is said to impart &quot;the ability to deceive without offending&quot;. He then incorporated it into the parapet of the castle. To be fair, Clíodhna does not take credit for all the blarney of the MacCarthys. Queen Elizabeth noted in frustration that she could not effect a negotiation with Cormac MacCarthy, whose seat was Blarney Castle, as everything he said was &#x27;Blarney, as what he says he does not mean&#x27;.

===John O&#x27;Donovan===

Irish antiquarian John O’Donovan claimed that Cleena visited to lament his grandfather&#x27;s death in 1798.

==Carrigcleena==

Carrigcleena, meaning Cleena&#x27;s rock, is a natural rock feature about south of Mallow. It was long considered as sacred ground by the local peasantry as Cliodhna&#x27;s principal palace. It consisted of rough ramparts of rocks encircling about a circle of green land. The encircling rocks rose about above the neighboring fields and occurred in a number of separate groups. Among the rocks were many caves of various sizes. One large square stone in the south east corner had some resemblance to an enormous door. A line of stones divide the inner area approximately in half. The outcrop is a very restricted occurrence of Devonian volcanic rocks. The place was described as having a &quot;melancholy, lonesome and frightful appearance&quot; and being &quot;strange and romantic&quot;.

According to folklore, fairies would assemble quarterly at Carrigcleena for their amusement and to conduct their business. Legends say fairies could be seen &quot;with the light of the declining moon in
their May dance, and Cleena at their head in the most splendid attire&quot;.

Only a small portion of the original rock outcrop remains, the rest being destroyed by quarrying. The remaining rock is only accessible via a short spur extending from the south wall of the quarry.

Cleena was said to have several other residences including one at Tonn-Cliodhna, &quot;Cleena&#x27;s Wave&quot; in Glandore. 

==Origins==
It has been suggested by J. O&#x27;Beirne Crowe that Clídna derives from the Gaulish goddess Clutonda or Clutondae

==In other media==

Clíona is referred to as an unwelcome pursuer in Edward Walsh&#x27;s poem, &quot;O’Donovan’s Daughter&quot;. And, in an ode by Muldowny O&#x27;Morrison praising Donel O&#x27;Donovan upon his accession to the chiefship of Clancahill, he is referred to as the &quot;Dragon of Clíodhna&quot;.

In the comic opera &quot;The Emerald Isle; or, The Caves of Carrig-Cleena&quot;, a woman disguises herself as Clíodhna to deceive occupying English soldiers.

The banshee queen Clíodhna herself features as a playable goddess in the MOBA Smite (video game) as the Celtic pantheon&#x27;s assassin, released in October 2021.

<doc id="86244" wikidata="Q5135536" url="?curid=86244" title="Clṻd">
<text>In Celtic mythology, Clṻd /klɨːd/ or Clọ:tā /klɔːtaː/ (Latin: Clōta) is a hypothesised/inferred Brittonic goddess of the River Clyde. If she was ever revered historically, she would presumably have been worshipped by the Damnonii tribe who held the territory around the Clyde basin which later was to become the Kingdom of Alt Clud (possibly Alclṻd, and later the Kingdom of Strathclyde (Ystrad Clud)), at least prior to the Christianisation of Roman Britain and possibly later.

Alt Clud had its base of power at Dumbarton Rock (&quot;Alt Clud&quot;), and later moved to Govan, both in immediate proximity to the Clyde. Alt Clud is known to have been in use since the Iron Age and therefore was also likely a prominent site for the Damnonii.

The name &quot;Clṻd&quot; is the reconstructed Brittonic form of the river name &quot;Clyde&quot; - which developed into &quot;Clut&quot; and/or &quot;Clud&quot; in Cumbric (a descendent of Brittonic that was spoken in Yr Hen Ogledd in the early medieval period – contemporary to Old Welsh), and &quot;Chluaidh&quot; in Gaelic, before reaching its current English form. James (2019) provides &quot;Clṻd&quot; meaning &quot;pure, cleansed&quot; for the river and &quot;Clọ:tā&quot; meaning &quot;she who is pure&quot; as a potential form for the goddess&#x27; name.

There is little if any direct evidence for the existence or worship of this deity, or the precise form of her name. In 1967 a tricephalic Celtic statue was found close to the Clyde and in the vicinity of the source of one of its minor tibutaries, and Ross (1974) interprets this as very likely to depict a god or gods (perhaps connected to the goddess of the river) in line with similar sculptures found elsewhere, which demonstrates likely Celtic worship of water-based deities in the area and time period.

Rhŷs (1891) points to the existence of the minor character Gwawl ap Clud in the first cycle of the Mabinogi, who is the initially betrothed of Rhiannon (reasonably herself interpreted as a divine figure). And proposes that this mythological figure (whom he connects to some form of solar divinity) should be read as the son of the goddess Clud (though typically Early/Pre-Medieval surnames were patronymic, there are cases - especially in myth such as the Mabinogi - where matronymic names are known (e.g. Gouannon mab Dôn and Amaethon mab Dôn in Culhwch and Olwen, both notably sons of the goddess Dôn)). This relationship is supported by MacKillop (2004), though whether the goddess &quot;Clud&quot; mentioned is related to the Clyde is not mentioned.

However, there is broad agreement that divine embodiments of natural bodies of water (e.g. springs, rivers, lakes) were very common in Celtic culture, to the point that it could be considered the norm for every such feature in an inhabited region to have an associated god or spirit (overwhelmingly female). As such, several authors conjecture the existence of this goddess based solely or primarily on the significance of the River Clyde and that its region was populated in the British Iron Age, generally presuming based on the etymology of the river name that she is a goddess associated with the concepts of purity, cleanliness, and/or washing.

<doc id="86245" wikidata="Q1105201" url="?curid=86245" title="Cocidius">
<text>In Romano-British religion, Cocidius was a deity worshipped in northern Britain. The Romans equated him with Mars, god of war and hunting, and also with Silvanus, god of forests, groves and wild fields. Like Belatucadros, he was probably worshipped by lower-ranked Roman soldiers as well as by the Britons for whom he was probably a tribal god - a genius loci.

==Etymology==
Rivet and Smith note that the name may be related to British Celtic &quot;cocco-&quot;, &#x27;red&#x27; (compare Welsh &quot;coch&quot; and Cornish &quot;kogh&quot;), suggesting that statues of the god might have been painted red. A figure discovered in the 1980s in the Otterburn Training Area and is known as the Red One.

== Representations and dedications ==

&quot;Fanocodi&quot; was a Roman place-name mentioned in the Ravenna &quot;Cosmography&quot; for a location close to the Solway Firth; the name has been derived from &quot;Fanum Cocidii&quot;, or temple of Cocidius, and the place identified with Bewcastle. There are dedications to Cocidius around Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and Cumbria, including the forts at Birdoswald and Bewcastle. Another inscription, at Ebchester, refers to him as &quot;Cocidius Vernostonus&quot;, Cocidius of the alder tree. A 2000-year-old carving of Cocidius was found in 2006 near Chesters Fort on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. This was dubbed the &quot;little man&quot; and shows a figure with its arms flung wide and legs braced firmly against the ground. Although the gender is not depicted, the shape and accessories are seemingly male, with a shield in the left hand, a sword in the right, and a scabbard hanging from the belt around his tunic. This is one of at least nine representations known in the Hadrian&#x27;s Wall corridor, and a further 25 or so inscriptions dedicated to him. Most of these are along the western portion of the Wall, the most spectacular being found at Yardhope, where a figure in bas-relief brandishes spear and shield on a vertical rock-face at the entrance to a small shrine.

==In literature==
William A. Young suggests that the characters of the &#x27;Dark Man&#x27; in the Brythonic romance &quot;Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain&quot;, the guardian of the chapel in Guillaume le Clerc&#x27;s &quot;Fergus of Galloway&quot;, and the Brown Man of the Moor in John Leyden&#x27;s &quot;The Cout o&#x27; Keeldar&quot; (1802) have their origins in Cocidius.

<text>Conall Cernach (modern spelling: Conall Cearnach) is a hero of the Ulaid in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. He had a crooked neck and is said to have always slept with the head of a Connachtman under his knee. His epithet is normally translated as &quot;victorious&quot; or &quot;triumphant&quot;, although it is an obscure word, and some texts struggle to explain it. Alternative meanings include &quot;angular, having corners&quot;, &quot;swollen&quot;, or &quot;possessing a dish or receptacle&quot;. The original form of the name &quot;Conall&quot; in Ogham inscriptions was &quot;Cunavalas&quot;.

==Legendary biography==

===Physical description===
In the destruction of Da Derga&#x27;s Hostel, Conall Cernach is described as follows:

&quot;I saw a man there in an ornamented dining compartment, who was the fairest of the warriors of Ireland. A fleecy crimson cloak about him. As white as the snow one of the cheeks on him, as freckled-red as the foxglove the other cheek. One of his two eyes is as blue as a hyacinth, as black as a beetle’s back the other eye. The measure of a reaping basket his bushy tree (of) fair, very blond (hair) that is on him. It strikes the edge of his two hips. It is as fleecy as a tufted ram. Though a sack of bountiful (?) red nuts were poured out over the top of his head, not a nut of them would fall to the ground. A goldhilted sword in his hand. A blood-red shield, dotted with rivets of white metal (tincopper alloy) between plates of gold. A long, three-ridged spear, as thick as an outer yoke (of a miller’s team?) the shaft that is on it.&quot;

===Birth===
He was born c. 50 BC. His father was Amairgin mac Echit and his mother was Findchoem. His parents&#x27; marriage was barren, until Findchoem visited a druid and was advised to drink from a certain well. She took a drink from the well, swallowing a worm with it, and became pregnant. Findchoem&#x27;s brother Cet mac Mágach, a Connachtman, protected his sister until she gave birth to a son, Conall. Druids came to initiate the child into their religion, and prophesied that he would kill more than half of the men of Connacht, and that he would always have a Connachtman&#x27;s head on his belt. Cet took the child, put him under his heel and tried to break his neck, but only damaged it, leaving his nephew with a crooked neck.

===Mac Da Thó&#x27;s Pig===

Conall would have a fierce rivalry with his uncle for the rest of his life. He shamed Cet at a feast at the house of Mac Dá Thó, a hospitaller of Leinster, when the warriors of Connacht and Ulster competed for the champion&#x27;s portion by boasting of their deeds. Cet reminded all comers how he had bested them in combat, including emasculating Celtchar with his spear. However, just as Cet was about to carve, Conall arrived, and his boasts topped even Cet&#x27;s. Cet admitted defeat, but claimed that if his brother Anlúan were present, his feats would top even Conall&#x27;s. Conall responded by tossing him Anlúan&#x27;s freshly severed head.

===Bricriu&#x27;s Feast===
He also competed for the champion&#x27;s portion at a feast held by the troublemaker Bricriu, albeit with less success. Bricriu went in turn to Conall, Lóegaire Búadach and Cú Chulainn, and promised each of them the champion&#x27;s portion. When the feast started each of the three warriors&#x27; charioteers stood up and claimed the champion&#x27;s portion for his master. A fight broke out between Conall, Láegare and Cú Chulainn, until King Conchobar, Fergus and Sencha intervened to separate them. Meanwhile, Bricriu went to each of the three heroes&#x27; wives - Conall&#x27;s wife Lendabair, Lóegaire&#x27;s wife Fedelm, and Cú Chulainn&#x27;s wife Emer - and promised them precedence at the feast, and when the women approached, Conall, Lóegaire and Cú Chulainn were almost set to violence again. Emer was the first to enter, as Cú Chulainn lifted the side of the house up to let her in, tipping Bricriu into a ditch. The Ulstermen asked first Ailill and Medb, king and queen of Connacht, then Cú Roí, king of Munster, to adjudicate the dispute. In every test set, Cú Chulainn came out on top, but neither Conall nor Lóegaire would accept the result. Finally, a hideous, giant churl, carrying a huge axe, appeared at Emain Macha. He challenged each of the three heroes to cut off his head, and then allow him to return the next day to cut off the hero&#x27;s head. Lóegaire accepted the challenge and cut off the churl&#x27;s head, and the churl picked up his head and left. He returned the next day, but Lóegaire was nowhere to be seen. Conall was the next to take up the challenge, but he too did not fulfil his side of the bargain. Finally Cú Chulainn cut off the churl&#x27;s head, and submitted himself to the churl&#x27;s axe the following day as promised. The churl spared him, revealed himself as Cú Roí, and declared that Cú Chulainn should have the champion&#x27;s portion undisputed at any feast held by the Ulstermen.

===Fráech&#x27;s Cattle Raid===
He helped the Connacht hero Fráech recover his abducted wife and sons and stolen cattle. They tracked them to Alba (Scotland), southwards through Britain, across the English Channel, through Lombardy, to the Alps, where they met an Irish girl herding sheep. She told them the land was ruled by warriors who stole cattle from far and near, and had recently brought back Fráech&#x27;s cattle and family. She advised them to go to the woman who tended the cows, who warned them that the fort where Fráech&#x27;s wife was kept was guarded by a serpent, but promised to leave the gate open for them. When they attacked the fort, the serpent leaped into Conall&#x27;s belt, and did him no harm. They liberated Fráech&#x27;s family, took all the cattle and treasure, and went back to Ireland the way they came.

===The Battle of Howth===
He fought Mes Gedra, king of Leinster, in single combat following a battle provoked by the Ulster poet Athirne. Mes Gedra had lost a hand in an earlier fight, so Conall fought him with one hand tucked into his belt. He won, taking his opponent&#x27;s head as a trophy. When he put Mes Gedra&#x27;s head on his shoulder, it straightened his neck. Conall&#x27;s charioteer couldn&#x27;t carry the head, so he cut out the brain and preserved it by mixing it with lime. The calcified brain was later stolen by Cet and used to kill Conchobar mac Nessa.

===The death of Cú Chulainn===
Conall and Cú Chulainn had sworn to each other that whoever was killed first, the other would avenge him before nightfall. When Lugaid mac Con Roí and Erc mac Cairpri killed Cú Chulainn, Conall pursued them. Lugaid had also lost a hand, and Conall again fought one-handed, but this time he only won when his horse Deirg nDruchtaig (Dewy or Dripping Red) took a bite out of Lugaid&#x27;s side. He took both their heads, and when he took Erc&#x27;s head back to Tara his sister, Achall, died of grief.

===Final showdown with Cet===
Conall pursued Cet after he had made a raid on Ulster, killing twenty-seven men and taking their heads. It had snowed, so he was able to follow his trail. He caught up with him, but was reluctant to face him until his charioteer chided him for cowardice. They met at a ford, and Conall killed Cet in a ferocious combat that left Conall near to death himself. He was found by Bélchú of Breifne, a Connachtman, who took him home, tended to his wounds, and planned to fight him when he was fit. But Bélchú soon regretted his honourable behaviour and asked his three sons to kill Conall as he lay in his sickbed. Conall overheard and forced Bélchú to take his place in the bed, and when his sons arrived they killed him instead. Conall then killed the three of them and took all four heads home.

===Later years===
After Conchobor and his son, Cormac Cond Longas, had been killed, Conall was offered the kingship of Ulster, but he refused it, putting forward instead his foster-son, Conchobar&#x27;s younger son Cúscraid, who was proclaimed king. In his declining years he contracted leprosy and went to stay with Ailill and Medb of Connacht, who were best placed to look after him, since they had the resources to satisfy his enormous appetite. Ailill was seeing another woman behind Medb&#x27;s back, so Medb incited Conall to kill Ailill, something he was happy to do as Ailill had killed Fergus mac Róich. Ailill was killed on 1 May, Lá Bealtaine, which was on a Tuesday. Conall fled, but the men of Connacht pursued and killed him at a ford on the following Monday, 7 May. Both oral tradition and old textual sources place this at the town of Ballyconnell, County Cavan.

==Family and Genealogy==

Conall&#x27;s wife was Lendabair, daughter of Eogain mac Durthacht. He also had other wives, including 1. Aifi, daughter of Bélcu Bréifne whom Conall had slain; 2. Niamh, daughter of Cealtair; 3. Feibe, daughter of Concubur and her son by Conall was Fiaca Fir Feibe; 4. Fedelm Noíchrothach, daughter of Conchobar mac Nessa. She was also the wife of Cairbre Nia Fer, whom she left to go to Conall; 5. Londcaidhe, daughter of Eatach Eachbeoil. Her son by Conall was Irial Glunmar. Unusually for a character from the Ulster Cycle, Conall appears in medieval Irish genealogies as the ancestor of the kings of the Dál nAraidi and the Uí Echach Cobo. The legendary High King Mal mac Rochride was also said to be descended from him.

== Modern Irish Folklore ==
In modern Irish folklore Conall is also an occurring character. Within it he has been conflated with and is told to be a member of the Fianna. One story recounts a tale about how Conall was present at and witnessed the Crucifixion of Jesus.

<doc id="86248" wikidata="Q1183379" url="?curid=86248" title="Deirdre">
<text>Deirdre ( , ; ) is a tragic heroine in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. She is also known by the epithet &quot;Deirdre of the Sorrows&quot; ().

Deirdre is a prominent figure in Irish legend. American scholar James MacKillop assessed in 2004 that she was its best-known figure in modern times.

==In legend==
Deirdre was the daughter of the royal storyteller Fedlimid mac Daill. Before she was born, Cathbad, the chief druid at the court of Conchobar mac Nessa, king of Ulster, prophesied that Fedlimid&#x27;s daughter would grow up to be very beautiful, but that kings and lords would go to war over her, much blood would be shed because of her, and Ulster&#x27;s three greatest warriors would be forced into exile for her sake.

Hearing this, many urged Fedlimid to kill the baby at birth, but Conchobar, aroused by the description of her future beauty, decided to keep the child for himself. He took Deirdre away from her family and had her brought up in seclusion by Leabharcham, a poet and wise woman, and planned to marry Deirdre when she was old enough. As a young girl, living isolated in the woodlands, Deirdre told Leabharcham one snowy day that she would love a man with the colours she had seen when a raven landed in the snow with its prey: hair the color of the raven, skin as white as snow, and cheeks as red as blood.

Leabharcham told her she was describing Naoise mac Uisneach, a handsome young warrior, hunter and singer at Conchobar&#x27;s court. With the collusion of Leabharcham, Deirdre met Naoise and they fell in love. Accompanied by his brothers Ardan and Ainnle (the other two sons of Uisneach), Naoise and Deirdre fled to Scotland. They lived a happy life there, hunting and fishing and living in beautiful places; one place associated with them is Loch Etive. Some versions of the story mention that Deirdre and Naoise had children, a son, Gaiar, and a daughter, Aebgreine, who were fostered by Manannan Mac Lir.

However, the furious, humiliated Conchobar tracked them down. He sent Fergus mac Róich to them with an invitation to return and Fergus&#x27;s own promise of safe conduct home. On the way back to Emain Macha, Conchobar had Fergus waylaid, forced by his personal geis (an obligation) to accept an invitation to a feast.

Fergus sent Deirdre and the sons of Uisneach on to Emain Macha with his son to protect them. When they arrived, Conchobar sent Leabharcham to spy on Deirdre, to see if she had lost her beauty. Leabharcham, to protect Deirdre, told the king that Deirdre was now ugly and aged. Conchobar then sent another spy, Gelbann, who managed to catch a glimpse of Deirdre but was seen by Naoise, who threw a gold chess piece at him and put out his eye.

The spy managed to get back to Conchobar, and told him that Deirdre was as beautiful as ever. Conchobar called his warriors to attack the Red Branch house where Deirdre and the sons of Uisneach were lodging. Naoise and his brothers fought valiantly, aided by a few Red Branch warriors, before Conchobar invoked their oath of loyalty to him and had Deirdre dragged to his side. At this point, Éogan mac Durthacht threw a spear, killing Naoise, and his brothers were killed shortly afterward.

Fergus and his men arrived after the battle. Fergus was outraged by this betrayal of his word, and went into exile in Connacht. He later fought against Ulster for Ailill and Medb in the war of the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; (the Cattle Raid of Cooley), sometimes referred to as &quot;the Irish Iliad&quot;.

After the death of Naoise, Conchobar took Deirdre as his wife. After a year, angered by Deirdre&#x27;s continuing coldness toward him, Conchobar asked her whom in the world she hated the most, besides himself. She answered &quot;Éogan mac Durthacht&quot;, the man who had murdered Naoise. Conchobar said that he would give her to Éogan. As she was being taken to Éogan, Conchobar taunted her, saying she looked like a ewe between two rams. At this, Deirdre threw herself from the chariot, dashing her head to pieces against a rock.

<doc id="86249" wikidata="Q346607" url="?curid=86249" title="Dee Dee Ramone">
<text>Douglas Glenn Colvin (September 18, 1951 – June 5, 2002), better known by his stage name Dee Dee Ramone, was an American musician. He was the bassist and a founding member of the punk rock band the Ramones. Throughout the band&#x27;s existence, he was the most prolific lyricist and composer, writing many of their best-known songs, such as &quot;53rd &amp; 3rd&quot;, &quot;Chinese Rock&quot;, &quot;Commando&quot;, &quot;Wart Hog&quot;, &quot;Rockaway Beach&quot;, &quot;Poison Heart&quot; and &quot;Bonzo Goes To Bitburg&quot; (also known as &quot;My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down&quot;). The latter won the New York Music Award for best independent single of the year in 1986, while &quot;Animal Boy&quot;, which the song is from, won for best album.

Dee Dee was the band&#x27;s lead vocalist until original drummer Joey Ramone took over lead vocalist duties. He was then the band&#x27;s bassist from 1974 until 1989, when he left to pursue a short-lived career in hip hop music under the name Dee Dee King, releasing the album &quot;Standing in the Spotlight&quot; in 1989. He soon returned to his punk roots and released four more solo albums featuring brand-new songs, many of which were later recorded by the Ramones. He toured the world playing his new songs, Ramones songs and some old favorites in small clubs, and continued to write songs for the Ramones until 1996, when the band retired.

Dee Dee was addicted to drugs, particularly heroin, for much of his life. He began using drugs as a teenager and continued to use for the majority of his adult life. He died from a heroin overdose on June 5, 2002, at the age of 50.

==Early life and family==
Douglas Glenn Colvin was born on September 18, 1951, in Fort Lee, Virginia. He was the son of an American soldier and a German woman. As an infant, his family relocated to West Berlin, West Germany, due to his father&#x27;s military service. His father&#x27;s military career also required the family to relocate frequently. As a result of these frequent moves, Douglas had a lonely childhood with few real friends. His parents separated during his early teens and he remained in Berlin until the age of 15 when he, along with his mother and sister Beverley, moved to Forest Hills, Queens, New York, in order to escape Dee Dee&#x27;s alcoholic father. There, he met John Cummings and Thomas Erdelyi (later dubbed Johnny and Tommy Ramone), then playing in a band called the Tangerine Puppets, named after a Donovan song.

Bassist Monty Colvin from the progressive metal band Galactic Cowboys is one of Dee Dee&#x27;s cousins.

==Career==
===Ramones===
Colvin, later Dee Dee, and Cummings, later Johnny, quickly became friends, as they were both social outcasts in their middle-class neighborhood. After an unsuccessful guitar audition for Television, Johnny convinced Dee Dee to form their own band with then-drummer Jeffrey Hyman, later Joey Ramone, in 1974. Dee Dee initially wanted to be the band&#x27;s lead vocalist in addition to being a guitarist along with Johnny, but had to switch to bass when their friend Richie Stern, who they had hired to be the band&#x27;s bassist, proved incapable of playing the instrument. Joey later took over vocal duties after Dee Dee decided that he could not sing lead vocals for longer than a few songs as his voice shredded. Dee Dee would continue, however, to count off each song&#x27;s tempo with his signature rapid-fire shout of &quot;1-2-3-4!&quot;

It was Dee Dee who first suggested naming the band the Ramones, after reading that Paul McCartney often signed into hotels under the alias &quot;Paul Ramon&quot;. He added an &#x27;e&#x27; to the end of that surname and the band members all agreed to adopt the surname &quot;Ramone&quot; as a means of conveying their unity.

In the early 1970s, Dee Dee worked at The Bureau of Advertising, located at 485 Lexington Ave., Manhattan, NYC. Later renamed The Newspaper Advertising Bureau, the agency promoted newspapers as the best media source for advertising. Dee Dee was a printer&#x27;s helper for about one year in the company&#x27;s small in-house print shop. Because of his creative abilities he would hang out, when he could, with the graphic designers in the company&#x27;s art department. In 1973, Colvin became friends with Arturo Vega, a Mexican artist who had relocated to New York City and would become a close associate of the Ramones for the duration of their existence. Officially dubbed their &quot;artistic director&quot;, Vega designed their famous logo, oversaw stage lighting and had other duties as needed.

The Ramones played before an audience for the first time on March 30, 1974, at Performance Studios. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Ramones&quot;, was greeted positively by rock critics. The album was not a commercial success, reaching only number 111 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. Their next two albums, &quot;Leave Home&quot; and &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot;, were released in 1977. &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; was the band&#x27;s highest-charting album to date, reaching number 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In 1978, the band released their fourth studio album, &quot;Road to Ruin&quot;. It failed to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100. However, &quot;I Wanna Be Sedated&quot;, which appeared both on the album and as a single, would become one of the band&#x27;s best-known songs. The artwork on the album&#x27;s cover was done by &quot;Punk&quot; magazine cofounder John Holmstrom.

Dee Dee wrote or co-wrote much of the Ramones&#x27; repertoire, such as &quot;53rd and 3rd&quot; (a song about male prostitution at 53rd Street and 3rd Avenue in Manhattan, allegedly based on personal experience), &quot;Glad to See You Go&quot; (written about his then-girlfriend, a stripper and fellow drug user with a volatile personality), &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way Back&quot;, &quot;Chinese Rocks&quot; (originally recorded by Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, as guitarist Johnny Ramone was not enthusiastic about the Ramones doing songs about drugs) and &quot;Wart Hog&quot; (a song Dee Dee wrote in rehab). After he quit the Ramones in 1989, Dee Dee continued to write songs for them, contributing at least three songs to each of their albums.

According to &quot;Mondo Bizarro&#x27;s&quot; liner notes, the Ramones once bailed Dee Dee out of jail in exchange for the rights to his songs &quot;Main Man&quot;, &quot;Strength to Endure&quot; and &quot;Poison Heart&quot;, which would become a minor hit for the band. The band&#x27;s final studio album, 1995&#x27;s &quot;¡Adios Amigos!&quot;, features several of Dee Dee&#x27;s solo songs, such as &quot;I&#x27;m Makin&#x27; Monsters for My Friends&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Not for Me to Know&quot; from his album &quot;I Hate Freaks Like You&quot;, and &quot;The Crusher&quot; from &quot;Standing in the Spotlight&quot;.

Dee Dee was a special guest at the final Ramones show at the Palace in Los Angeles on August 6, 1996. He performed lead vocals on &quot;Love Kills&quot;.

Recognition of the band&#x27;s importance grew over the years. The Ramones ranked number 26 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; and number 17 in VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;. In 2002, the Ramones were ranked the second-greatest band of all time by &quot;Spin&quot;, trailing only The Beatles.

Dee Dee was present when the Ramones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002, the first year they were eligible, and not long after lead singer Joey had died. Dee Dee humorously congratulated himself at the induction.

===Later music projects===
In 1987, before leaving the Ramones, Dee Dee embarked on a brief hip hop career as rapper &quot;Dee Dee King&quot; with the album &quot;Standing in the Spotlight&quot;. Dee Dee had recorded &quot;Funky Man&quot; as Dee Dee King in 1987. Music critic Matt Carlson wrote that the album &quot;will go down in the annals of pop culture as one of the worst recordings of all time&quot;. After the album failed, he returned to punk rock with various short-lived projects such as Sprocket (which also featured Richard &#x27;The Atomic Elf&#x27; Bacchus of D Generation and the Spikey Tops). In 1987 Dee Dee wrote and produced a song called &quot;Baby Doll&quot; for the Chesterfield Kings (&quot;Baby Doll&quot;/&quot;I Cannot Find Her&quot;, acoustic version 1987, Mirror Records, later recorded by American rock and roll band the Connection, on their album &quot;New England&#x27;s Newest Hit Makers&quot;).
Months after he left the Ramones, in the fall of 1989, Dee Dee already performed songs such as &quot;Poison Heart&quot; and &quot;Main Man&quot; (later to be recorded by the Ramones) with his band the Spikey Tops.

In 1991, Dee Dee was briefly involved with transgressive punk rock singer-songwriter GG Allin, playing the guitar with Allin&#x27;s backup band the Murder Junkies. His involvement lasted approximately one week, enough for him to be briefly interviewed during the filming of Todd Phillips&#x27; Allin documentary &quot;&quot;. In the film, Dee Dee reveals that he was unaware of the band&#x27;s name, even after joining. Rehearsal recordings of him with Allin and the Murder Junkies appears on the &quot;Hated&quot; soundtrack, as well as on the posthumous live Allin compilation &quot;Res-Erected&quot;. Video footage of the rehearsals is available on DVD through Allin&#x27;s estate&#x27;s website. Dee Dee never actually played a live gig with the band.

In 1992, Dee Dee formed another short-lived project named Dee Dee Ramone and the Chinese Dragons, which was followed by the most successful of his post-Ramones projects, a group named Dee Dee Ramone I.C.L.C. (Inter-Celestial Light Commune), which lasted from 1994 to 1996. The group featured New York City bassist John Carco (formerly of Queens hardcore group Misguided) who befriended Dee Dee when the two attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings together during the summer of 1992. After writing more than a dozen songs and recording several demos for an upcoming Ramones album with producer Daniel Rey, Dee Dee decided to keep the material for his new band. After working with several drummers and playing several live shows in the New York City area, Dee Dee and Carco moved to Amsterdam to record a four-song EP and fourteen-track album for Rough Trade Records. &quot;I Hate Freaks Like You&quot; was released on April 17, 1994. It features Nina Hagen on two of the album&#x27;s fourteen tracks. The three-piece line up now consisted of Dee Dee (vocals, guitar), Carco (bass, vocals), and Dutch drummer Danny Arnold Lommen.

I.C.L.C. would go on to promote the &quot;I Hate Freaks Like You&quot; album by touring 22 countries over a 10-month period. In January 1995, the group had completed their 10-month tour and returned to their headquarters in Amsterdam to begin recording a second album. The group was soon dropped, however, by their record label, Rough Trade World Service. With this development, bassist John Carco left the group and moved to Los Angeles where he formed and played with Frankie O. and Pete Stahl (singer of D.C.H.C. group Scream) in the group Metro. Carco would later pursue an acting career. Songs written by Dee Dee and Carco for the never-released second I.C.L.C. album would appear on the Ramones&#x27; final album &quot;¡Adios Amigos!&quot;. One of these songs, &quot;Born to Die in Berlin&quot;, appeared as the final song on the final Ramones&#x27; album, and featured Dee Dee singing in German on the bridge of the song. &quot;Fix Yourself Up&quot; was recorded by Dee Dee on the album &quot;Zonked&quot;.

Dee Dee formed a Ramones&#x27; tribute band called the Ramainz with his wife Barbara (&quot;Barbara Ramone&quot;, bass) and former Ramones&#x27; member Marky (drums). They recorded an album, &quot;Live in NYC&quot;, released in Argentina and many other countries, and played a couple of times with C.J. Ramone.

Dee Dee also recorded several solo albums. &quot;Zonked!&quot;, the first album release under the Dee Dee Ramone moniker, was retitled &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Fun?&quot; for the European release. Other than the addition of the bonus track &quot;Please Kill Me&quot;, the releases are the same the line-up for this album was Dee Dee Ramone on guitars and lead vocals, Marky Ramone on drums, longtime partner Daniel Ray producing and on guitars, and Barbara &quot;Ramone&quot;/Zampini on bass and lead vocals. Guests included Joey Ramone singing lead on &quot;I am seeing UFOs&quot;, and the Cramps&#x27; vocalist Lux Interior doing so on &quot;Bad Horoscope&quot;.

The second solo album was called &quot;Hop Around&quot;; the line-up consisted of Dee Dee Ramone, Barbara Ramone/Zampini, Chris Spedding on guitars and Billy Rogers on drums. Dee Dee also released &quot;Greatest &amp; Latest&quot;, with Barbara, Spedding and Chase Manhattan on drums. This album consisted of re-recordings of Ramones songs, a re-recorded solo song (&quot;Fix Yourself Up&quot;, originally from &quot;Zonked!&quot;/&quot;Ain&#x27;t It Fun?&quot;), cover-songs and an unreleased new solo-song (&quot;Sidewalk Surfin&#x27;&quot;).

In the 21st century, Dee Dee teamed up with Paul Kostabi, leader of the hardcore punk band Youth Gone Mad and former guitarist for White Zombie. An established artist, Kostabi was instrumental in getting Dee Dee&#x27;s new career as a painter off the ground. Together with Barbara, the trio collaborated on several hundred works that sold quickly for a few hundred dollars each. In 2012, the tenth anniversary of Dee Dee&#x27;s death was observed by a show at a prominent art gallery in California.

On Halloween, 1998, while staying at the Hotel Chelsea, Dee Dee and Zampini met the Hollywood band SEXYCHRIST, which featured adult film star Kurt Lockwood. Lockwood encouraged them to move to Hollywood, and together the two bands shared a successful tour of the U.S. in early 1999. Afterwards, Dee Dee formed the Dee Dee Ramone Band, with members including Christian Martucci (vocals and guitar), Anthony Smedile (drums), Chase Manhattan (drums), and Stefan Adika (bass). With the exception of one show at the Spa Club in NYC and a Club Makeup performance, this would be his last touring band. Dee Dee would release a book, entitled &quot;Legend of a Rock Star, A Memoir: The Last Testament of Dee Dee Ramone&quot;, written while on tour in Europe in 2001.

Dee Dee later moved to California, where he continued to make music and pursued an acting career. He was unsuccessful as an actor but landed a major role in the 2002 low-budget film &quot;Bikini Bandits&quot;. He contributed the song &quot;In a Movie&quot; to the film&#x27;s soundtrack, featuring his wife Barbara on lead vocals.

His next album, a live album produced by Gilby Clarke (formerly of Guns N&#x27; Roses) would have been recorded on June 12, 2002, at Hollywood&#x27;s Key Club, but plans fell through. Bootlegs of the Dee Dee Ramone Band exist, amongst them &quot;Live in Milan, Italy&quot;. Dee Dee&#x27;s final studio recordings were released by Trend iS dEAD! records as the 2002 album &quot;Youth Gone Mad featuring Dee Dee Ramone&quot;. He also worked with the band Terrorgruppe.

===Equipment===
Though he used both a Danelectro and Fender Musicmaster Bass in the first two years of the Ramones, he is primarily associated with the Fender Precision Bass, which he used exclusively between 1976 and 1986. In the late 1980s, he began using a variety of custom ESP basses which he would use for the rest of his tenure with the band. He used Ampeg amplification during his entire career with the Ramones.

===Writing===
Dee Dee Ramone&#x27;s autobiography &quot;My Right to Survive&quot; was published as &quot;Poison Heart: Surviving the Ramones&quot; in 1998. A second revision edition appeared in 2001. It was republished as &quot;Lobotomy: Surviving the Ramones&quot; in 2016. Dee Dee co-authored the book with Veronica Kofman. Another nonfiction work, &quot;Legend of a Rock Star&quot;, written by Dee Dee alone, presents daily journal of commentary on his last, hectic European tour in the spring of 2001.

His novel &quot;Chelsea Horror Hotel&quot; relates a story in which he and his wife move into New York City&#x27;s famous/notorious Hotel Chelsea and believe they are staying in the same room where Sid Vicious allegedly killed his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen. Ramone is visited by Vicious, as well as other dead punk rock friends such as Johnny Thunders, Stiv Bators, and Jerry Nolan.

==Personal life==
In 1978, Dee Dee married Vera Boldis. According to Boldis, Dee Dee&#x27;s struggles with mental illness and drug abuse put a strain on the couple&#x27;s relationship. They separated in 1990 before finalizing their divorce in 1995.

In November 1994, Dee Dee met 16-year-old Barbara Zampini while searching for his lost guitar outside his hotel in Argentina. Zampini was a fan and influenced by Dee&#x27;s early work. She had been playing bass for two years. They would later marry. She went on tour with him, and they remained together until his death. Following his death, Barbara managed his estate, calling herself Barbara Ramone Zampini.

According to drummer Marky Ramone, he was politically conservative.

Dee Dee Ramone was found dead at his home in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles on the evening of June 5, 2002. An autopsy established a heroin overdose as the official cause of death. He had been booked to perform at the Majestic Ventura Theater, which ended up being a memorial show in his honor.

Dee Dee Ramone is buried at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, not far from the bronze memorial to his former Ramones bandmate, Johnny Ramone. His headstone features the Ramones seal with the line &quot;I feel so safe flying on a ray on the highest trails above&quot; taken from his song &quot;Highest Trails Above&quot;, from the Ramones&#x27; &quot;Subterranean Jungle&quot; album. At the stone&#x27;s base is the line &quot;O.K...I gotta go now.&quot; Every day a large group of “Ramones Ducks” march up the hill to Dee Dee’s grave.

<text>Conchobar mac Nessa (son of Ness) is the king of Ulster in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. He rules from Emain Macha (Navan Fort, near Armagh). He is usually said to be the son of the High King Fachtna Fáthach, although in some stories his father is the druid Cathbad, and he is usually known by his matronymic, &quot;mac Nessa&quot;: his mother is Ness, daughter of Eochaid Sálbuide, King of Ulster.

Conchobar was an important figure in the Ulster Cycle, appearing in the Táin Bó Cúailnge and a number of other stories where he is depicted as a good king.

==Legendary biography==
===Birth===
There are several versions of how Conchobar was conceived. In the earliest, Ness, daughter of Eochaid Sálbuide, the then king of Ulster, asks the druid Cathbad what it is an auspicious time for. Cathbad replies, &quot;for begetting a king on a queen&quot;. There are no other men around, so Ness takes Cathbad to bed and she conceives a son. In a later version, Ness is brought up by twelve foster-fathers, and while all twelve are at a feast, Cathbad, leading a &quot;fian&quot; or landless war-band, attacks the house and kills them all. Eochaid is unable to avenge them as the culprit cannot be identified, so Ness forms her own &quot;fian&quot; to hunt Cathbad down. But while she is bathing alone in a pool, Cathbad appears, stands between her and her weapons, and bares his sword. He spares her life on the condition that she becomes his wife. They settle near a river called Conchobar, and Ness soon conceives a son, but in this version, the father is the High King Fachtna Fáthach, who is Ness&#x27;s lover. As she and Cathbad set out to visit Fachtna, Ness goes into labour. Cathbad tells her if she can manage not to give birth until the following day, her son will be a great king and have everlasting fame, for he will be born on the same day as Jesus Christ. Ness sits on a flagstone by the river Conchobar, and the following morning gives birth. The baby falls into the river, but Cathbad lifts him out, names him Conchobar after the river, and brings him up as his own son.

===Conchobar becomes king===
By the time Conchobar is seven, Fergus mac Róich is king of Ulster and falls in love with Ness. She agrees to become his wife, on one condition: that Fergus allows Conchobar to be king for a year, so his children will be called the sons of a king (under Medieval Irish law inheritance passed through the male line, and only those who had a king as a male-line ancestor were eligible for kingship). The nobles of Ulster advise Fergus that this will not affect his standing with them, as the boy will be king in name only, so he agrees. But Conchobar, advised by his mother, rules so well that by the end of the year it&#x27;s decided he should be king permanently. Fergus makes an alliance with the new High King, Eochu Feidlech, and they make war on Ulster. After a series of bloody battles, Conchobar makes overtures for peace. Fergus is offered land, the Champion&#x27;s Portion at Emain Macha, and the position of Conchobar&#x27;s heir. Conchobar demands compensation from Eochu for the killing of his father, Fachtna Fáthach, and is granted land, status and the High King&#x27;s daughter in marriage.

===Marriages and family===
Conchobar marries several of Eochu&#x27;s daughters. Medb, later queen of Connacht, is the first. She bears him a son called Amalgad, but soon leaves him.

Her sister Eithne conceives a son by him, but Medb murders her by drowning her in a stream. Her son Furbaide is delivered by posthumous Caesarian section.

Mugain bears him a son called Glaisne and remains his chief wife.

The mother of Conchobar&#x27;s eldest son, Cormac Cond Longas, is either Eochu&#x27;s daughter Clothru or Conchobar&#x27;s own mother Ness. Cormac is given to Fergus mac Róich to foster.

His other sons include Cúscraid Mend Macha and Folloman. His daughter Fedelm Noíchrothach marries Cairbre Nia Fer, King of Tara, and they have a son, Erc, and a daughter, Achall.

Conchobar has two sisters, Findchóem and Deichtine. Findchóem marries the poet Amergin, and they have a son, Conall Cernach. Deichtine is the mother of Cú Chulainn, by either her mortal husband Sualtam or the god Lugh, making Conchobar his uncle.

===Deirdre===
When Conchobar is visiting the house of his storyteller Fedlimid mac Daill, Fedlimid&#x27;s wife gives birth to a daughter. Cathbad, now Conchobar&#x27;s chief druid, prophesies that she will be so beautiful that kings will go to war over her, and she will bring nothing but sorrow. The child is named Deirdre, and Conchobar decides to have her brought up in seclusion from men, intending to marry her when she comes of age. However, she elopes with a young warrior called Naoise. Along with Naoise&#x27;s two brothers, the couple go into hiding and are eventually forced to flee to Scotland. Wherever they settle, the local king tries to have the brothers killed so he can have Deirdre for himself, and they have to move on. Eventually, Conchobar tracks them down to a remote island and sends Fergus to them with his guarantee of safe passage home. On the way home he arranges for Fergus to be separated from his charges by having him invited to a feast, so they are escorted back to Emain Macha by Fergus&#x27;s son Fiachu. When they arrive, Fiachu, Naoise and his brothers are murdered on Conchobar&#x27;s orders by Éogan mac Durthacht, and Deirdre is forced to marry Conchobar.

Fergus, outraged by the death of his son and the betrayal of his honour, makes war against Conchobar, alongside Cormac Cond Longas, who sides with his foster-father against his father, and Dubthach Dóeltenga. They burn Emain and slaughter the maidens of Ulster, before going into exile with Medb and her husband Ailill in Connacht.

Deirdre lives with Conchobar for a year, but during that time she never smiles, rarely eats or sleeps, and refuses to be comforted. Conchobar asks her what it is she hates, and she replies, &quot;you, and Éogan mac Durthacht.&quot; Conchobar gives her to Éogan. The next day, riding in Éogan&#x27;s chariot, she commits suicide by dashing her head against a stone.

===The Cattle Raid of Cooley===
When Medb raises an army from four of the five provinces of Ireland and launches an invasion of Ulster to steal the bull Donn Cúailnge in the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot;, Conchobar, like all the Ulstermen but Cú Chulainn, is unable to fight, disabled by the curse of Macha. Cú Chulainn fights a series of single combats against Connacht champions, hoping to give the Ulstermen time to recover and take the field.

Eventually, Cú Chulainn&#x27;s father, Sualtam, comes to Conchobar at Emain Macha to warn him of the devastation the Connacht army is creating and demand he raise his army before it&#x27;s too late. Conchobar and his druids agree that Sualtam should be put to death for breaking the protocol of the court - no-one is permitted to speak before Conchobar but the druids - and Sualtam runs out, but falls and decapitates himself on the sharpened edge of his shield. His severed head is brought back in on his shield, still crying out his warning. Conchobar raises his army and leads them into battle. During the fighting, Fergus has him at his mercy, but Cormac Cond Longas prevents his foster-father from killing his biological father, and Fergus strikes off the top of three hills instead. Medb is eventually forced to retreat by Cú Chulainn, but manages to bring the bull back to Connacht, where it fights her husband Ailill&#x27;s bull Finnbhennach, kills it, and dies of exhaustion.

===The Battle of Ros na Ríg===
After the &quot;Táin&quot;, Conchobar falls ill and doesn&#x27;t eat or sleep. The Ulaid ask Cathbad to find out what&#x27;s wrong with their king. Conchobar tells Cathbad that he is ill because the other four provinces of Ireland have made war against him with impunity. Although he was victorious against Ailill and Medb, neither of them was killed in the battle, and he still lost his bull. He wants to make war against Connacht, but it is now winter, so Cathbad advises him to wait until summer when his men and horses will be fresh and energetic, and in the meantime, call on all his foreign allies to bring reinforcements. He sends word to Conall Cernach, who is raising tribute in the Scottish islands, and he raises a great fleet of the Ulaid&#x27;s allies in Scandinavia and the Faroe Islands and brings them home to Ulster.

In response to this build-up, the other provinces mobilise. Eochu mac Luchta, king of Munster, convinces Ailill and Medb, very much against Medb&#x27;s better judgement, to offer reparations to Conchobar. Ailill sends a man the Ulaid have reason to mistrust as their envoy to make the offer. Conchobar rejects the offer and says he will not be satisfied until he is able to pitch his tent anywhere in Ireland. When asked where he wants to pitch his tent that night, he selects Ros na Ríg (Rosnaree) on the River Boyne. A battle ensues at Ros na Ríg between the Ulaid on one side, and on the other side the kingdom of Meath, led by Conchobar&#x27;s son-in-law Cairpre Nia Fer, king of Tara, and the Gailióin of Leinster, led by their king Find mac Rossa. The battle goes badly for the Ulaid until Conall Cernach joins the fray because the wavering Ulstermen are too scared of him to retreat. Conall kills a thousand men in the battle. Cairpre Nia Fer kills 800 before Cú Chulainn kills him with a spear thrown from a distance, and then beheads him before his body hits the ground. The Gailióin retreat and the Ulaid take Tara. Erc, Cairpre&#x27;s son and Conchobar&#x27;s grandson, is installed as the new king of Tara. He swears allegiance to Conchobar and is given Cú Chulainn&#x27;s daughter Fínscoth in marriage.

===Death===
The story of Conchobar&#x27;s death was a popular medieval tale and is recorded in many manuscripts which given different versions of the story.

Conchobar is eventually killed as a result of a wound inflicted by the Connacht warrior Cet mac Mágach. Cet had stolen one of Ulster&#x27;s trophies of battle, the petrified brain of Mesgegra, king of Leinster, and shoots it from his sling so it embeds itself in Conchobar&#x27;s head; this is supposed to have taken place at Baile Ath in Urchair, (Ardnurcher). Conchobor&#x27;s physicians are unable to remove it, but sew up the wound and tell the king he will survive so long as he doesn&#x27;t get excited or over-exert himself. Seven reasonably peaceful years later, Conchobar is told of the death of Christ and becomes so angry that the brain bursts from his head, and he dies. The blood from the wound baptises him as a Christian, and his soul goes to heaven. While this account of his death has been superficially Christianised, it also bears strong resemblances to the Scandinavian myth of Thor&#x27;s fight against Hrungnir, suggesting either a common origin of the two episodes or a later borrowing during the era of Viking influence in Ireland.

The Ulstermen invite his son Cormac Cond Longas, still in exile in Connacht, to succeed him as king, but on his way to Emain Macha Cormac is forced to break his &quot;geasa&quot; or taboos, and is killed in battle at Da Choca&#x27;s Hostel. On Conall Cernach&#x27;s recommendation the kingship is then given to Conchobar&#x27;s other son, Cúscraid Mend Macha.

<text>John Eric Bartholomew (14 May 1926 – 28 May 1984), known by his stage name Eric Morecambe, was an English comedian who together with Ernie Wise formed the double act Morecambe and Wise. The partnership lasted from 1941 until Morecambe&#x27;s death in 1984. Morecambe took his stage name from his home town, the seaside resort of Morecambe in Lancashire.

He was the co-star of the BBC1&#x27;s television series &quot;The Morecambe &amp; Wise Show&quot;, which for the 1977 Christmas episode gained UK viewing figures of over 28 million people. One of the most prominent comedians in British popular culture, in 2002 he was named one of the 100 Greatest Britons in a BBC poll.

==Early life and childhood career==

Eric Morecambe was born at 12.30pm on Friday, 14 May 1926 at 42 Buxton Street, Morecambe, Lancashire to George and Sarah Elizabeth &quot;Sadie&quot; (née Robinson) Bartholomew. He was christened on 6 June as John Eric Bartholomew. Sadie took work as a waitress to raise funds for his dancing lessons. During this period, Eric Bartholomew won numerous talent contests, including one in Hoylake in 1940 for which the prize was an audition in Manchester for Jack Hylton. Three months after the audition, Hylton invited Morecambe to join a revue called &quot;Youth Takes a Bow&quot; at the Nottingham Empire, where he met Ernest Wiseman, who had been appearing in the show for some years as &quot;Ernest Wise&quot;. The two soon became very close friends, and with Sadie&#x27;s encouragement started to develop a double act.

When the two were eventually allowed to perform their double act on stage (in addition to their solo spots), Hylton was impressed enough to make it a regular feature in the revue. However, the duo were separated when they came of age for their War Service during the final stages of the Second World War. Wise joined the Merchant Navy, while Morecambe was conscripted to become a Bevin Boy and worked as a coal miner in Accrington from May 1944 onwards.

==Career==

===Morecambe and Wise===
After the war, Morecambe and Wise began performing on stage and radio and secured a contract with the BBC to make a television show, where they started the short-lived show &quot;Running Wild&quot; in 1954, which was poorly received. They returned to the stage to hone their act, and later made appearances on &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot; and &quot;Double Six&quot;.

===&quot;Two of a Kind&quot;: 1961–1968===
In 1961, Lew Grade offered the duo a series for the London-based ITV station ATV. Entitled &quot;Two of a Kind&quot;, it was written by Dick Hills and Sid Green. An Equity strike halted that show, but Morecambe and Wise were members of the Variety Artists&#x27; Federation, then a separate trade union unaffiliated with Equity. Green and Hills later appeared in the series as &quot;Sid&quot; and &quot;Dick&quot;.

The sixth Morecambe and Wise series for ATV was planned from the start to be aired in the United Kingdom as well as exported to the United States and Canada. It was taped in colour and starred international guests, often American. Prior to its British run, it was broadcast in North America by the ABC network as a summer replacement for re-runs of &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, under the title &quot;The Piccadilly Palace&quot;, from 20 May to 9 September 1967. All but two episodes of this series are now believed to be lost, with the surviving two episodes existing only as black-and-white copies, bearing the UK titles.

The duo had appeared in the US on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. In 1968, Morecambe and Wise left ATV to return to the BBC.

===With the BBC: 1968–1978===
While Morecambe was recuperating from a heart attack, Hills and Green, who believed that Morecambe would probably never work again, quit as writers. Morecambe and Wise were in Barbados at the time and learned of their writers&#x27; departure only from the steward on the plane. John Ammonds, the show&#x27;s producer, replaced Hills and Green with Eddie Braben. Theatre critic Kenneth Tynan stated, Braben made Wise&#x27;s character a comic who was not funny, while Morecambe became a straight man who was funny. Braben made them less hostile to one another.

Morecambe and Wise did annual BBC Christmas shows from 1968 to 1977, with the 1977 show having an estimated audience of 28,385,000, although at a time when there were only three UK television channels. They were one of the most prominent comedy duos in British popular culture and in 1976 were both appointed OBEs. (Morecambe&#x27;s wife, Joan, received an OBE in 2015 for her work with children&#x27;s charities.)

===With Thames Television: 1978–1983===
The pair left the BBC for ITV in January 1978, signing a contract with the London station Thames Television.

Morecambe suffered a second heart attack at his home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, on 15 March 1979; this led to a heart bypass operation, performed by Magdi Yacoub on 25 June 1979. At that time, Morecambe was told he only had three months to live.

Morecambe increasingly wanted to move away from the double act, and into writing and playing other roles. In 1980, he played the &quot;Funny Uncle&quot; in a dramatisation of the John Betjeman poem &quot;Indoor Games Near Newbury&quot;, part of an ITV special titled &quot;Betjeman&#x27;s Britain&quot;. Produced and directed by Charles Wallace, it spawned the start of a working relationship that led to a follow-up in 1981 for Paramount Pictures titled &quot;Late Flowering Love&quot; in which Morecambe played an RAF major. The film was released in the UK with &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. In 1981, Morecambe published &quot;Mr Lonely&quot;, a tragicomic novel about a stand-up comedian. He began to focus more on writing.

They also appeared together recalling their music hall days in a one-hour special on ITV on 2 March 1983, called &quot;Eric &amp; Ernie&#x27;s Variety Days&quot;. During this time Morecambe published two other novels: &quot;The Reluctant Vampire&quot; (1982) and its sequel, &quot;The Vampire&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1983). Morecambe and Wise&#x27;s final show together was the 1983 Christmas special for ITV.

Morecambe and Wise worked on a television movie in 1983, &quot;Night Train to Murder&quot;, which was broadcast on ITV in January 1985. Continuing his collaboration with Wallace, Morecambe also acted in a short comedy film called &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot; opposite Tom Baker and Madeline Smith, again directed by Wallace for MGM/UA. It was released in the cinema with the James Bond film &quot;Octopussy&quot; and later with &quot;WarGames&quot;. Wallace and Morecambe were halfway through filming a fourth film when Morecambe died. It was never completed.

==Personal life==
Eric Morecambe married Joan Bartlett in Margate, Thanet, Kent, on 11 December 1952. They held their wedding reception at the Bulls Head pub in Margate. They had three children: Gail (born 1953); Gary (born 1956) and Steven (who was born in 1970, and whom they adopted in 1974). Joan Bartlett Morecambe died on her 97th birthday on 26 March 2024.

In his leisure time, Eric was a keen birdwatcher, and the statue of him at Morecambe shows him wearing his binoculars. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds named a hide after him at the nearby Leighton Moss RSPB reserve in recognition of his support. In 1984 the RSPB bought the Old Hall Marshes Reserve near Tolleshunt D&#x27;Arcy in Essex for £780,000, helped by donations to the &quot;Eric Morecambe Memorial Appeal&quot;.

Morecambe was the nephew of the rugby league player John &quot;Jack&quot; Bartholomew.

Alongside various other celebrities, Morecambe sent a message of support to Margaret Thatcher after she won the 1979 general election, wishing her luck during the 1979 European election campaign. His message ended, &quot;God bless you, Maggie, and good luck in the European Campaign and it is your round next.&quot;

In a diary entry from 17 August 1967, when Morecambe and Wise were appearing in Great Yarmouth as part of a summer season, Morecambe observed: &quot;I have a slight pain on the left side around my heart. It&#x27;s most likely wind, but I&#x27;ve had it for about four days. That&#x27;s a hell of a time to have wind.&quot;

He suffered a near-fatal heart attack late on 7 November 1968 after a show, while driving back to his hotel outside Leeds.

Morecambe had been appearing with Wise during a week of midnight performances at the Variety Club in Batley, Yorkshire. Morecambe and Wise appeared there in December 1967 for a week, making £4,000 ().

Since the beginning of the week Morecambe noticed he had pains in his right arm but thought little of it, thinking the pains were tennis elbow or rheumatism. That night, he headed back to his hotel, and recounted in an interview with Michael Parkinson in November 1972 that, as the pains spread to his chest, he became unable to drive. He was rescued by a passerby as he stopped the car. The first hospital they arrived at had no Accident and Emergency. At the second one, Morecambe admitted himself and a heart attack was immediately diagnosed. Morecambe was due to appear at the London Palladium with his partner Ernie Wise on 18 November 1968 but had to miss the performance as he was recovering in hospital. The comedian Frankie Howerd and impressionist Mike Yarwood were both late stand-ins for them instead.

After leaving hospital on 24 November 1968 under orders not to work for three months Morecambe gave up his cigarette habit and started smoking a pipe, as he mentioned that he was trying to do in August 1967. He also stopped doing summer and winter seasons and reduced many of his public engagements. Morecambe took six months off, returning for a press call at the BBC Television Centre in May 1969. On 27 July of that year, Morecambe and Wise returned to the stage at the Bournemouth Winter Gardens, and received a four-minute standing ovation.

Morecambe suffered a second heart attack in March 1979 and underwent bypass surgery in June.

==Death==
Morecambe took part in a charity show, hosted by close friend and comedian Stan Stennett, at the Roses Theatre in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, on Sunday 27 May 1984. His wife Joan, who was in the audience, recalled that Morecambe was &quot;on top form&quot;.

After the show had ended and Morecambe had first left the stage, the musicians returned and picked up their instruments. He rushed back onto the stage to join them and played various instruments making six curtain calls. On leaving the stage for the final time as the house tabs fell, he stepped into the wings and collapsed with his third heart attack in 16 years. He was rushed to Cheltenham General Hospital, where he died just before 3 a.m on Monday 28 May.

His funeral was held on 4 June at St Nicholas Church, Harpenden, with the principal address delivered by Dickie Henderson. There was a private cremation service at Garston. His ashes were later returned to the church for burial in the Garden of Remembrance.

Ernie Wise said in an interview, &quot;I think I had two sad days, I think – when my father died and, actually, when Eric died.&quot;

==Legacy==

* A larger-than-life statue of Morecambe, created by sculptor Graham Ibbeson, was unveiled by the Queen at Morecambe in July 1999 and is surrounded by inscriptions of many of his favourite catchphrases and an exhaustive list of guest stars who appeared on the show. The statue was vandalised in October 2014, having had one of its legs sawn off. Subsequently, it was moved to London for repair and was restored on 11 December 2014. 

* In Harpenden, Hertfordshire, where Morecambe and his family lived from the 1960s until his death, the public concert hall is named after him, with a portrait of Morecambe hanging in the foyer. Morecambe often referred to Harpenden in his comedy, with a band once appearing on the show named &quot;The Harpenden Hot-Shots&quot; and in a Casanova sketch he introduced himself as Lord Eric, Fourth Duke of Harpenden &quot;and certain parts of Birkenhead&quot;. Morecambe was the guest of honour, and performed the opening ceremony at the 75th Anniversary Fete of St George&#x27;s School, Harpenden. 
* A West End Show, &quot;The Play What I Wrote&quot;, opened in 2001 as a tribute to the duo. Directed by Kenneth Branagh, each performance featured a different guest celebrity. In March 2003, the show transferred to Broadway. 
* In 2003, Morecambe&#x27;s eldest son Gary released &quot;Life&#x27;s Not Hollywood, It&#x27;s Cricklewood&quot;, a biography of his father from the point of view of his family, using family photos and extracts from previously unseen diaries. 
* Kenilworth Road Stadium, the home of Luton Town F.C., has a suite named after Morecambe. He was a supporter and one-time president of the club.
* J D Wetherspoon opened a public house called &quot;The Eric Bartholomew&quot; in Morecambe in 2004.
* At the Roses Theatre in Tewkesbury, the Eric Morecambe Room is used by local and national companies for conferences and meetings.
* There is a bird hide named after him at Leighton Moss RSPB reserve, which is on Morecambe Bay, near Carnforth, Lancashire.
* The play &quot;Morecambe&quot; was created as a celebration of the life of Eric Morecambe. It played at the Edinburgh fringe festival in 2009 and subsequently transferred to London&#x27;s West End before embarking on a UK tour in 2010.
* In February 2016 Morecambe&#x27;s 1968 Jensen Interceptor, which he had bought for £4,500, was offered for sale at £150,000.
* In November 2024 it was announced that a collection of Morecambe&#x27;s memorabilia and personal items, from his former home, Brachefield in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, would be sold, following the death in March of his widow, Joan. The collection includes telegrams from Prince Philip and letters from Margaret Thatcher and fellow comics Ronnie Barker and Tommy Cooper. At the auction, on 9 February 2025, Morecambe&#x27;s distinctive imitation tortoiseshell Metzler spectacles and pipe were bought by long-time fan Robbie Williams for £20,000, much more than their £2,000 to £4,000 estimate.

<text>Condatis (Gaulish: &#x27;confluence&#x27;) was an ancient Celtic deity worshipped primarily in northern Britain but also in Gaul. He was associated with the confluences of rivers, in particular within County Durham in the North of England.

Condatis is known from several inscriptions in Britain and a single inscription found at Alonnes, Sarthe, France. In each case he is equated with the Roman god Mars.

== Name ==
The theonym &quot;Condatis&quot; derives from the stem &quot;condāt&quot;-, meaning &#x27;confluence&#x27;, itself from Proto-Celtic *&quot;kom-dati-&quot;, from an earlier &quot;kom-dhh1-ti-&quot; (&#x27;put with, put together&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;grouping, reunion&#x27;).

The stem &quot;condāt&quot;- is also attested in personal names, including &quot;Condatus&quot;, &quot;Condatius&quot;, and &quot;Condatie&quot;, as well as in toponyms such as &quot;Condé&quot;, &quot;Condat&quot;, &quot;Candé&quot;, &quot;Conte&quot;, &quot;Condes&quot;, &quot;Candes&quot;, &quot;Cosnes&quot;, &quot;Condate&quot; (the old name of Rennes and Northwich), &quot;Condom&quot;, &quot;Condéon&quot; (both from *&quot;Condate-o-magos&quot;), &quot;Cond&quot; (&lt; *&quot;Condate-dunum&quot;), &quot;Kontz&quot;, &quot;Conz&quot; (Trier), and &quot;Canstatt&quot; (Condistat).

== Cult ==
The cult title is probably related to the place name &quot;Condate&quot;, often used in Gaul for settlements at the confluence of rivers. 
The Celtic god &quot;Condatis&quot; is thought to have functions pertaining to water and healing.

Roman altar-inscriptions to &quot;Mars Condates&quot; have been found near Roman forts in County Durham in the North of England that may suggest a &#x27;confluence-deity&#x27; cult and the possibility that river confluences may have been used as pagan ritual sacrifice or human sacrifice sites.

==Archaeological evidence==

===British Isles===
Roman altars with inscriptions to &quot;Mars Condates&quot; have been found in the Tees and Wear valleys of County Durham.
 Altars are normally found at the confluence of rivers – for example, the Cong Burn–Wear confluence near Chester-le-Street – however others may have been disturbed or removed, especially by antiquarians and collectors.

The inscription &quot;Mars Condates&quot; is a (joining) of deities:
# Roman god Mars – god of war and father of Romulus, the founder of Rome.
# Gaulish deity Condatis – god of river confluences.

<text>In ancient Celtic religion, Ialonus Contrebis or Ialonus or Gontrebis was a god (or perhaps two related gods) worshipped in what are now Lancashire and Provence. Ialonus is thought to be the god of clearings and/or meadows.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Ialonus&quot;, which may have designated a god of clearing, derives from the Celtic stem &quot;ialo(n)&quot;- (&#x27;cleared place, clearing&#x27;; cf. Middle Welsh &quot;ial&quot; &#x27;clearing&#x27;, &quot;an-ial&quot; &#x27;wasteland&#x27;). The stem &quot;ialon&quot;- also had the meaning &#x27;village&#x27; in Gaulish. In the words of Xavier Delamarre, &quot;In forest-covered Gaul, a village was essentially established by clearing a wood.&quot;

The name &quot;Contrebis&quot; is based on the prefix &quot;con&quot;- (&#x27;with, together&#x27;) attached to the root &quot;-treb&quot;- (&#x27;settlement&#x27;; cf. Old Irish &quot;treb&quot;, Middle Welsh &quot;tref&quot;, Old Breton &quot;treff&quot; &#x27;town, dwelling-place&#x27;). It can be compared with the Celtiberian place name &quot;Contrebia&quot;, meaning &#x27;conurbation&#x27;.

== Cult ==
He is known from three dedicatory inscriptions. One, at Lancaster, was dedicated (in the dative) to &quot;Deo Ialono Contre Sanctissimo&quot; (&quot;to the holiest god Ialonus Contre[bis]&quot;); another, at Overborough or Over Burrow near Kirkby Lonsdale, to &quot;Deo San Gontrebi&quot; (&quot;to the holy god Gontrebis&quot;). In the third inscription, found at Nîmes in Provence, Ialonus was invoked in conjunction with the goddess Fortune.

<doc id="86258" wikidata="Q1138061" url="?curid=86258" title="Coventina">
<text>Coventina was a Romano-British goddess of wells and springs. She is known from multiple inscriptions at one site in Northumberland, England, an area surrounding a wellspring near Carrawburgh on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. It is possible that other inscriptions, two from Hispania and one from Narbonensis, refer to Coventina, but this is disputed.

==The well==

Dedications to Coventina and votive deposits were found in a walled area which had been built to contain the outflow from a spring now called &quot;Coventina&#x27;s Well&quot;. The well and the walled area surrounding it are near the Roman fort and settlement on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, now known as Carrawburgh, which was called &quot;Brocoliti&quot; in the Ravenna Cosmography), from the 7th century but based on earlier sources, and &quot;Procolitia&quot; in the 5th century document Notitia Dignitatum. The remains of a Roman Mithraeum and Nymphaeum are also found near the site.

The well itself was a spring in a rectangular basin 2.6m x 2.4m in the centre of a walled enclosure 11.6m x 12.2m within a wall 0.9m thick. The contents of the well included 13,487 coins from Mark Anthony to Gratian, a relief of three water nymphs, the head of a male statue, two dedication slabs to the goddess Coventina, ten altars to Coventina and Minerva, two clay incense burners, and a wide range of votive objects.

The site near Coventina&#x27;s Well was excavated by British archaeologist John Clayton in 1876. The date of the wall at Coventina&#x27;s Well is uncertain, but some have theorized that it was built sometime after the completion of the Roman fort (dated between the years 128 and 133). Since Hadrian&#x27;s Wall does not deviate to avoid the well, this may suggest that the boundary wall around the well was built some time after in order to control the flow of water in a marshy area.

Evidence from coin hoards and stones which covered them and those also blocking the well suggest a fairly abrupt end around 388, perhaps due to events linked to anti-pagan edicts of Theodosius I.

==Statues==
Excavation of the site revealed several inscribed altars, some with depictions of Coventina in typical Roman nymph form - reclining, partially clothed and associated with water. On one, Coventina is either depicted in triple form or with two attendants.

==Inscriptions==
At least ten inscriptions to Coventina are recorded from Carrawburgh. Several stone altars contained dedications to Coventina as did two pottery incense burners.

An example of an inscription from the site reads:

:&quot;Deae Cov{v}entinae&quot; /
:&quot;T D Cosconia&quot; /
:&quot;nvs Pr Coh&quot; /
:&quot;I Bat L M&quot;

“To the Goddess Coventina, Titus D[unclear] Cosconianus, Prefectus of the First Cohort of Batavians, freely and deservedly (dedicated this stone).”

<text>John Heartfield (born Helmut Herzfeld; 19 June 1891 – 26 April 1968) was a German visual artist who pioneered the use of art as a political weapon. Some of his most famous photomontages were anti-Nazi and anti-fascist statements. Heartfield also created book jackets for book authors, such as Upton Sinclair, as well as stage sets for contemporary playwrights, such as Bertolt Brecht and Erwin Piscator.

==Biography==

===Early life, education and work===
John Heartfield was born Helmut Herzfeld on 19 June 1891 in Berlin-Schmargendorf, Berlin under the German Empire. His parents were Franz Herzfeld, a socialist writer, and Alice (née Stolzenburg), a textile worker and political activist.

In 1899, Helmut, his brother Wieland, and their sisters Lotte and Hertha were abandoned in the woods by their parents after Franz Herzfeld was accused of blasphemy. His family had to flee to Switzerland and later they were deported to Austria. When their parents disappeared in 1899, Heartfield and his siblings were left abandoned in a mountain hut. The four children went to live with an uncle, Ignaz, in the small Austrian town of Aigen.

In 1908, he studied art in Munich at the Königliche Kunstgewerbeschule München (Royal Bavarian Arts and Crafts School). Two commercial designers, Albert Weisgerber and Ludwig Hohlwein, were early influences.

While living in Berlin, he began styling himself &quot;John Heartfield&quot;, an anglicisation of his German name, to protest against anti-British fervour sweeping Germany during the First World War, when Berlin crowds often shouted &quot;Gott strafe England!&quot; (&quot;May God punish England!&quot;) in the streets.

During the same year, Heartfield, his brother Wieland and George Grosz launched the Malik publishing house in Berlin. In 1916, he and George Grosz experimented with pasting pictures together, a form of art later named photomontage, and which would become a central characteristic of their work.

In 1917, Heartfield became a member of Berlin Club Dada. Heartfield would later become active in the Dada movement, helping to organise the Erste Internationale Dada-Messe (First International Dada Fair) in Berlin in 1920. Dadaists were provocateurs who disrupted public art gatherings and ridiculed the participants. They labeled traditional art trivial and bourgeois.

In January 1918, Heartfield joined the newly founded German Communist Party (KPD).

===Interwar period===
In 1919, Heartfield was dismissed from the Reichswehr film service because of his support for the strike that followed the assassination of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. With George Grosz, he founded &quot;Die Pleite&quot;, a satirical magazine.

Heartfield met Bertolt Brecht in 1924, and became a member of a circle of German artists that included Brecht, Erwin Piscator, Hannah Höch, and a host of others.

Though he was a prolific producer of stage sets and book jackets, Heartfield&#x27;s main form of expression was photomontage. Heartfield produced the first political photomontages. He mainly worked for two publications: the daily &quot;Die Rote Fahne&quot; (&quot;The Red Flag&quot;) and the weekly communist magazine &quot;Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung&quot; (&quot;AIZ&quot;; &quot;Workers&#x27; Illustrated Newspaper&quot;), the latter of which published the works for which Heartfield is best remembered. He also built theatre sets for Erwin Piscator and Bertolt Brecht.

During the 1920s, Heartfield produced a great number of photomontages, many of which were reproduced as dust jackets for books such as his montage for Upton Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;The Millennium&quot;.

It was through rotogravure, an engraving process whereby pictures, designs, and words are engraved into the printing plate or printing cylinder, that Heartfield&#x27;s montages, in the form of posters, were distributed in the streets of Berlin between 1932 and 1933, when the Nazis came to power.

His political montages regularly appeared on the cover of &quot;Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung&quot; from 1930 to 1938, a popular weekly whose circulation (as many as 500,000 copies at its height) rivaled any other contemporary German magazine. Since Heartfield&#x27;s photomontages appeared on this cover, his work was widely seen at newsstands.

Heartfield lived in Berlin until April 1933 when the Nazi Party took power. On Good Friday, the SS broke into his apartment, but he escaped by jumping from his balcony and hiding in a trash bin. He fled Germany by walking over the Sudeten Mountains to Czechoslovakia. He eventually rose to number five on the Gestapo&#x27;s most-wanted list.

In 1934, he combined four bloody axes tied together to form a swastika to mock the &quot;Blood and Iron&quot; motto of the Reich (&quot;AIZ&quot;, Prague, 8 March 1934).

In 1938, given the imminent German occupation of Czechoslovakia, he was forced once again to flee from the Nazis. Relocating to England, he was interned as an enemy alien, and his health began to deteriorate. Afterward, he lived in Hampstead, London. His brother Wieland was refused a British residency permit in 1939 and instead left for the United States with his family.

===Postwar period===
In the aftermath of World War II, Heartfield was denied his written applications to remain in England for &quot;his work and his health&quot;, and was convinced in 1950 to join Wieland, who had been living in East Berlin, East Germany. Heartfield moved into an apartment next to his brother&#x27;s, at 129A Friedrichstrasse. However, his return to Berlin was seen with suspicion by the East German government due to his 11-year stay in England and the fact his dentist was under suspicion by the Stasi. He was interrogated and released having narrowly avoided a trial for treason, but was denied admission into the East German Akademie der Künste (Academy of the Arts). He was forbidden to work as an artist and was denied health benefits.

Due to the intervention of Bertolt Brecht and Stefan Heym, Heartfield was formally admitted to the Academy of the Arts in 1956. Although he subsequently produced some montages warning of the threat of nuclear war, he was never again as prolific as in his youth.

In East Berlin, Heartfield worked closely with theatre directors such as Benno Besson and Wolfgang Langhoff at Berliner Ensemble and Deutsches Theater. He created innovative stage set designs for Bertolt Brecht and David Berg. Using Heartfield&#x27;s minimal props and stark stages, Brecht interrupted his plays at key junctures to have the audience be part of the action and not lose themselves in it.

In 1967, he visited Britain and began preparing a retrospective exhibition of his work, which was subsequently completed by his widow Gertrud and the Berlin Academy of Arts, and shown at the ICA in London in 1969.

==Works==

He is best known for the 240 political art photomontages he created from 1930 to 1938, mainly criticising fascism and Nazism. His photomontages satirising Adolf Hitler and the Nazis often subverted Nazi symbols such as the swastika in order to undermine their propaganda message.

===Selection of notable works===
* &quot;Adolf, the Superman&quot; (published in the &quot;Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung&quot; [&quot;AIZ&quot;, &quot;Workers&#x27; Illustrated Newspaper&quot;], Berlin, 17 July 1932), used a montaged X-ray to expose gold coins in Adolf Hitler&#x27;s esophagus leading to a pile in his stomach as he rants against the fatherland&#x27;s enemies.
* In &quot;Göring: The Executioner of the Third Reich&quot; (&quot;AIZ&quot;, Prague, 14 September 1933), Hermann Göring is depicted as a butcher.
* &quot;The Meaning of Geneva, Where Capital Lives, There Can Be No Peace&quot; (&quot;AIZ&quot;, Berlin, 27 November 1932), shows the peace dove impaled on a blood-soaked bayonet in front of the League of Nations, where the cross on the Swiss flag is changed into a swastika.
* &quot;Hurrah, die Butter ist Alle!&quot; (&quot;Hurray, There&#x27;s No Butter Left!&quot;) was published on the front page of the &quot;AIZ&quot; in 1935. A pastiche of the aesthetics of propaganda, the photomontage shows a German family at a dinner table eating a bicycle, with a portrait of Hitler hanging on the wall; the wallpaper is emblazoned with swastikas. A baby gnaws on an executioner&#x27;s axe, also emblazoned with a swastika, and a dog licks an oversized nut and bolt. The title is written in large letters, in addition to a quote uttered by Hermann Göring during a food shortage. Translated, the quote reads: &quot;Hooray, the butter is all gone!&quot;. Göring once said in an address delivered in Hamburg: &quot;Iron ore has made the Reich strong. Butter and drippings have, at most, made the people fat&quot;.

==Death and legacy==

Following a lifelong history of illness, Heartfield died on 26 April 1968 in East Berlin, East Germany. He was buried in the Dorotheenstadt Cemetery, adjacent to Brecht&#x27;s former home.

After his widow Gertrud Heartfield&#x27;s death, the East German Academy of the Arts took possession of all of Heartfield&#x27;s surviving works. When the West German Academy of Arts absorbed the East German Academy, the Heartfield Archive was transferred with it.

From November to December, 1974 the Ministry of Culture and the Academy of Arts of the Democratic Republic of Germany (East Germany) hosted an exhibition of John Heartfield photomontages at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris.

From 15 April to 6 July 1993, the New York City Museum of Modern Art hosted an exhibition of Heartfield&#x27;s original montages.

In 2005, the British Tate Gallery held an exhibition of his photomontage pieces. The Museum Ludwig in Cologne held a retrospective exhibition of Marinus and Heartfield in 2008.

In 2023, an animated documentary about Heartfield was released, directed by Katrin Rothe.

==In popular culture==

&quot;Hurray, There&#x27;s No Butter Left!&quot;, was an inspiration for the song &quot;Metal Postcard&quot; by Siouxsie and the Banshees. This song was re-recorded in German as &quot;Mittageisen&quot; and released as a single in September 1979 in Germany with Heartfield&#x27;s work as the cover art. A few months later the single was also released in the UK. The Swiss darkwave band Mittageisen (1981–1986) is named after this song&#x27;s title.

Hurray, There&#x27;s No Butter Left, was the text on the bottom of a photo of a German family, which can be found in a political comic posted into a banned communist magazine, in 1935.

Slovenian and former Yugoslav avant-garde music group Laibach has a number of references to Heartfield&#x27;s works: the original band&#x27;s logo, the &#x27;black cross&#x27;, references Heartfield&#x27;s art &quot;Der alte Wahlspruch im &quot;neuen&quot; Reich: Blut und Eisen&quot; (1934), a cross made of four axes, as can be seen on the inner sleeves and labels of their 1987 album Opus Dei. The cover art of their self-titled debut album Laibach (Ropot, 1985, Ljubljana), also references Heartfield&#x27;s &quot; Wie im Mittelalter… so im Dritten Reich&quot; (1934). A track called &quot;Raus! (Herzfelde)&quot;, originally on Slovenska Akropola, but also included in Krst pod Triglavom and Opus Dei as &quot;Herzfeld (Heartfield)&quot;, is about Heartfield.

British hardcore punk band Discharge used Heartfield&#x27;s work &quot;Peace and Fascism&quot; for the cover artwork of their 7-inch EP Never Again, 1981.

English post-punk band Blurt recorded a song called &quot;Hurray, the Butter is All Gone!&quot; on their 1986 album Poppycock.

Armenian-American alternative metal band System of a Down used Heartfield&#x27;s poster for the Communist Party of Germany (&quot;The Hand Has Five Fingers&quot;) as cover art on their 1998 self-titled debut album.

German experimental group Einstürzende Neubauten reference Heartfield and his brother Wieland Herzfelde, as well as other Dadaist and Futurist artists such as Kurt Schwitters, Hannah Höch, George Grosz and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in the track &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It a Dada&quot; from their 2007 album &quot;Alles wieder offen&quot;.

<text>An autograph is a person&#x27;s own handwriting or signature. The word &quot;autograph&quot; comes from Ancient Greek (, &quot;autós&quot;, &quot;self&quot; and , &quot;gráphō&quot;, &quot;write&quot;), and can mean more specifically:
* a manuscript written by the author of its content. In this meaning the term &quot;autograph&quot; can often be used interchangeably with holograph.
* a celebrity&#x27;s handwritten signature. Autograph collecting is the activity of collecting such autographs.

==History==

What might be considered the oldest &quot;autograph&quot; is a Sumerian clay table from about 3100 BC which includes the name of the scribe Gar.Ama. No ancient written autographs have been found, and the earliest one known for a major historical figure is that of El Cid from 1098.

==Autograph manuscript==

&quot;Autograph&quot; can refer to a document transcribed entirely in the handwriting of its author, as opposed to a typeset document or one written by an amanuensis or a copyist. This meaning overlaps that of &quot;holograph&quot;.

==Celebrity&#x27;s signature==
Autograph collecting is the hobby of collecting autographs of famous persons. Some of the most popular categories of autograph subjects are presidents, military soldiers, athletes, movie stars, artists, social and religious leaders, scientists, astronauts, and authors.

* Memorial to the 56 Signers of the Declaration of Independence, stone blocks with depicted signatures
* , specifically a signature made by an agent on behalf of a principal

<doc id="86261" wikidata="Q1140870" url="?curid=86261" title="Crom Cruach">
<text>Crom Cruach ( ) was a pagan god of pre-Christian Ireland. According to Christian writers, he was propitiated with human sacrifice and his worship was ended by Saint Patrick.

He is also referred to as &quot;Crom Cróich&quot;, &quot;Cenn Cruach&quot;/&quot;Cróich&quot; () and &quot;Cenncroithi&quot; (). He is related to the later mythological and folkloric figure Crom Dubh.

The references in a &quot;dinsenchas&quot; (&quot;place-lore&quot;) poem in the 12th century to sacrifice in exchange for milk and grain suggest that Crom had a function as a fertility god. The description of his image as a gold figure surrounded by twelve stone or bronze figures has been interpreted by some as representing the sun surrounded by the signs of the zodiac, suggesting a function as a solar deity.

== Name ==
Crom Cruach&#x27;s name takes several forms. &quot;Crom&quot; (or &quot;cromm&quot;) means &quot;bent, crooked, stooped&quot; or according to O&#x27;Reilly is perhaps related to &quot;cruim&quot; meaning &quot;thunder&quot;. &quot;Cenn&quot; means &quot;head&quot;, and by extension &quot;head, chief&quot;. &quot;Cruach&quot; (or &quot;crúach&quot;) is a noun meaning &quot;pile, heap, mound, stack&quot;, generally of grain, hay, peat or other gathered goods, booty, and so on, including slaughtered fighters. A common extension is its reference to hills or mountains that look like stacks or piles.

Crom Cruach is called the chief Celtic idol of Ireland by Michael J. O&#x27;Kelly, and was located on Magh Slécht (The &quot;Plain of Prostrations&quot;) in County Cavan, surrounded by twelve other idols.

== Literary references ==

According to an Irish &quot;dinsenchas&quot; (&quot;place-lore&quot;) poem in the 12th century Book of Leinster, Crom Cruach&#x27;s cult image, consisting of a gold figure surrounded by twelve stone figures, stood on Magh Slécht (&quot;the plain of prostration&quot;) (pronounced Moy Shlokht) in County Cavan, and was propitiated with first-born sacrifice in exchange for good yields of milk and grain. Crom Cruach is described as a wizened god, hidden by mists, and is said to have been worshipped since the time of Érimón. An early High King, Tigernmas, along with three quarters of his army, is said to have died while worshipping Crom on Samhain eve, but worship continued until the cult image was destroyed by St. Patrick with a sledgehammer.

This incident figures prominently in medieval legends about St. Patrick, although it does not appear in his own writings, nor in the two 7th century biographies by Muirchu and Tírechán. However J.B. Bury, infers that there is a missing passage in Tírechán about Crom Cruaich; L. Bieler, who edited the two biographies, is non-committal on the point.

In the 9th century &quot;Tripartite Life of Saint Patrick&quot; the deity is called Cenn Cruach, and his cult image consists of a central figure covered with gold and silver, surrounded by twelve bronze figures. When Patrick approaches it he raises his crozier, the central figure falls face-down, with the imprint of the crozier left in it, and the surrounding figures sink into the earth. The &quot;demon&quot; who inhabits the image appears, but Patrick curses him and casts him to hell. Jocelin&#x27;s 12th century &quot;Life and Acts of St. Patrick&quot; tells much the same story. Here the god is called Cenncroithi, interpreted as &quot;the head of all gods&quot;, and when his image falls the silver and gold covering it crumble to dust, with the imprint of the crozier left on bare stone.

== Archaeology ==
A decorated stone known as the Killycluggin Stone (, meaning &#x27;the Wood of the Bell-Shaped Stone&#x27;) has been interpreted by some as the cult image of Crom Cruach. It was found at Killycluggin, County Cavan. It was discovered broken in several pieces and partly buried close to a Bronze Age stone circle (54.090773, -7.634122), inside which it probably once stood.

The 14th century &quot;Book of McGovern&quot;, written in Magh Slécht, contains a poem which states that Crom was situated at Kilnavert beside the road and that the local women used to tremble in fear as they passed by. There is still a local tradition in the area that the Killycluggin Stone is the Crom stone.

There is another standing stone identified with Crom Crúaich in Drumcoo townland, County Fermanagh. It has the figure of a man walking engraved on it, representing either Saint Patrick or a druid, depending on when it was engraved. A nearby street is named Crom Crúaich Way after it.

A large wooden idol from the 4th century AD has recently been discovered in Gortnacrannagh, County Roscommon.

<doc id="86265" wikidata="Q1151065" url="?curid=86265" title="Cú Roí">
<text>Cú Roí mac Dáire (Cú Ruí, Cú Raoi) is a king of Munster in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. He is usually portrayed as a warrior with superhuman abilities and a master of disguise possessed of magical powers. His name probably means &quot;hound of the plain/field&quot;, or more specifically, &quot;hound of the battlefield&quot;. He is the son of Dáire mac Dedad (or Dáire Doimthech), and thus belongs to the Clanna Dedad. However, T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly believed this to be artificial, stating that &quot;Cú Roí and Dáire are ultimately one and the same&quot;.

Though often an outsider figure, for instance in the role of intervener or arbitrator, Cú Roí appears in a great number of medieval Irish texts, including &quot;Forfess Fer Fálgae&quot;, &quot;Amra Con Roi&quot;, &quot;Brinna Ferchertne&quot;, &quot;Aided Chon Roi&quot; (in several recensions), &quot;Fled Bricrenn&quot;, &quot;Mesca Ulad&quot; and &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot;. The early Irish tale-lists refer to such titles as &quot;Aided Chon Roí&quot;, &quot;Echtra Chon Roí&quot; (List A), &quot;Orgain Chathrach Chon Roí&quot; and &quot;Cathbúada Con Roí&quot; (List B), but only the first of these tales can be shown to have survived in some form. Several tales describe the enmity between him and the Ulster hero Cú Chulainn, who eventually kills him.

==&quot;Fled Bricrenn&quot;==

Cú Roí plays an important role in the 8th-century tale &quot;Fled Bricrenn&quot; (&quot;Bricriu&#x27;s Feast&quot;). The trickster Bricriu incites the heroes Cú Chulainn, Conall Cernach and Lóegaire Búadach to compete for the champion&#x27;s portion at a feast, and Cú Roí is one of those who judged among them. Like all the other judges, he chooses Cú Chulainn, but Conall and Lóegaire refuse to accept his verdict. When the three heroes return to Ulster, Cú Roí appears to each in the guise of a hideous churl (&quot;bachlach&quot;) and challenges them to behead him, then allow him to return and behead them. Only Cú Chulainn is brave and honourable enough to submit himself to the churl&#x27;s axe, so he is declared champion. This story is related to the &quot;beheading game&quot; motif appearing in many later works in Arthurian literature - most famously the 14th-century English poem &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, although closer correspondences are to be found in &quot;Diu Crône&quot; and &quot;La Mule sans frein&quot;, both of which feature a revolving fortress like Cu Roi&#x27;s.

==&quot;Táin bó Cúailnge&quot;==
===Combat of Munremar and Cú Roí===
Cú Roí appears in the side-tale &quot;Comlond Munremair &amp; Con Roi&quot; (&quot;The combat of Munremar and Cú Roí&quot;) included in Recension I of &quot;Táin bó Cúailnge&quot;. Cú Roí, who has sent a contingent to the Connacht army but had not hitherto been personally involved in the recent hostilities between Ulster and Connacht, does intervene when he learns that the Ulster warrior Munremar mac Gerrginn (lit. &quot;Fatneck son of Shorthead&quot;) has come to assist Cú Chulainn in fighting the Connacht army. Since he believes no warrior in the army was able to withstand Munremar, he chooses to rally to the support of &quot;his people&quot; (&quot;muinter&quot;). The resulting encounter (&quot;comlond&quot;) between the two warriors is a spectacular stone-throwing contest, described from the perspective of the Connacht troops, who witness many stones flying in opposite directions from the east and west (Cotal and Ard Róich) and colliding right above their heads. The shower of falling rubble forces them to use their shields for protection, until on their request, Cú Roí and Munremar agree to discontinue the fight and return home. The plain strewn with stones is afterwards called Mag Clochair (&quot;The Stony Plain&quot;).

===The Trance of Amairgin===
Cú Roí further appears in the episode known as &quot;The Trance of Amairgin&quot;, variants of which appear in Recension I and II of the &quot;Táin bó Cúailnge&quot;.

The episode appears as &quot;Aislinge n-Aimirgin&quot; (&quot;The trance of Amairgin&quot;) in Recension I of the &quot;Táin&quot;. Having followed news of Cú Chulainn&#x27;s sustained success in single-handedly opposing the Connacht army, Cú Roí once again appears on the scene, this time to fight Cú Chulainn directly. However, on finding Cú Chulainn weak from the injuries which Ferdiad had recently inflicted on him, he refused to carry out his original plan. Instead he faces the giant warrior poet Amairgin, who in a trance is hurling stones at the Connacht army in Tailtiu, with devastating effects. Cú Roí attacks him in kind and their stones meet in the air. They pause when on Cú Roí&#x27;s request, Amairgen allows the cattle to go past Tailtiu, but seeing as the passage had become difficult, Cú Roí agrees to withdraw from the contest altogether.

The episode in the Book of Leinster (Recension II), called &quot;Imthúsa Chon Ruí meic Dáire&quot; (header) or &quot;Oislige Amargin&quot; (text), offers by and large the same story, but adds more explicit detail, notably on the point of Cú Roí&#x27;s sense of honour in his encounters with Cú Chulainn and Amairgin. First, Cú Roí explains his refusal to fight Cú Chulainn not only by pointing out the inequality between a physically healthy and an injured warrior, but also by saying that a victory would not be his, seeing as it was Fer Diad who had laid low his opponent. Second, the conclusion of Cú Roí&#x27;s fight with Amairgin is told from a perspective which highlights the role of honour in his motives. Medb insisted &quot;[b]y the truth of your [Cú Roí&#x27;s] valour&quot; (&quot;&quot;) that he should abandon the competition, obstructive as it proved to be to the progress of the expedition. Cú Roí, however, was determined to persist &quot;till the day of doom&quot; (&quot;co brunni brátha&quot;) unless Amairgin agreed to stop. (When the matter was settled and Cú Roí returned to his country, Amairgin resumed his attacks on the invading army, explaining that his agreement was with Cú Roí only.)

==Death tale and fragments==
Cú Roí&#x27;s death by Cú Chulainn&#x27;s hand is the subject of the tale &quot;Aided Con Roi&quot;, which survives in two versions. A number of tales describe enmity between the two warriors, and some allude to a lost story of its origin. Texts such as &quot;Forfess Fer Fálgae&quot; and &quot;Siaburcharpát Con Culainn&quot; describe a raid on Inis Fer Falga (possibly the Isle of Man) in which Cú Roí and Cú Chulainn come into conflict. The texts indicate that two were involved in an Ulster raid on the Fir Falgae, with Cú Roí participating again in disguise. They steal treasure and abduct Bláthnat, daughter of the king of the island, who loves Cú Chulainn. But when Cú Roí is asked to choose his share, he chooses Bláthnat. Cú Chulainn tries to stop him taking her, but Cú Roí drives him into the ground up to his armpits, cuts off his hair and, according to the &quot;Aided Conrói Mac Dáiri&quot;, rubbed cow dung onto his head before escaping, taking Bláthnat with him.

===&quot;Aided Con Roí&quot;===
Later, Bláthnat (Blanaid) betrays Cú Roí to Cú Chulainn, who besieges his fort and killed him. In one version of the story, Cú Roí&#x27;s soul was hidden in an apple in the belly of a salmon which lived in a stream in the Slieve Mish Mountains, and only surfaced once every seven years; Bláthnat discovered the secret and told Cú Chulainn, who killed the fish, enabling him to kill Cú Roí. However Ferchertne, Cú Roí&#x27;s poet, enraged at the betrayal of his lord, grabbed Bláthnat and leaped off a cliff, killing her and himself.

Cú Roí&#x27;s uncle (or brother or nephew), Conganchnes (&quot;Horn-skinned&quot;), tried to avenge him, but was killed by Celtchar. His son, Lugaid mac Con Roí, later succeeds in avenging him by killing Cú Chulainn, a story told in &quot;Aided Con Culainn&quot;. Lugaid is himself killed by Conall Cernach.

In another version Cú Roí takes Bláthnat to the fort and keeps her captive there. Bláthnat communicates with Cú Chulainn and a plan is hatched. Taking an opportunity when most of Cú Roí&#x27;s men are absent from the fort, Bláthnat gives the signal to Cú Chulainn by pouring milk into the Fionnghlaise (white stream - now the Derrymore River). Cú Chulainn, on seeing the stream become white, storms the fort, kills Cú Roí, and carries off Bláthnat. As Cú Roí&#x27;s men return up the valley, Bláthnat places a spell which makes the valley walls dance in front of the men&#x27;s eyes. Walkers who ascend Caherconree via the Derrymore River valley can still see this effect which is caused by an optical illusion.

==Clanna Dedad==
According to the genealogical schemes, Cú Roí is cousin to the famous monarch Conaire Mór, son of Eterscél, son of Íar mac Dedad, brother of Cú Roí&#x27;s father Dáire mac Dedad. All belong to the Clanna Dedad, a leading dynasty of the Érainn.

==Caherconree==
The Iron Age ruin of Caherconree (Irish &quot;Cathair Con Raoi&quot;, Cú Roí&#x27;s castle) in the Slieve Mish Mountains, on the Dingle Peninsula or Corcu Duibne, County Kerry, preserves Cú Roí&#x27;s name.

==Cú Roí in Welsh literature==
Cú Roí&#x27;s name also appears in two examples of medieval Welsh literature. First, it occurs in the corrupt form &quot;Cubert m. Daere&quot; in the Middle Welsh tale &quot;Culhwch ac Olwen&quot;, along with the names of other characters of the Ulster Cycle – Conchobor, Fergus, Conall Cernach and Lóegaire Búadach. Here the Irish heroes form one group out of a long list of King Arthur&#x27;s warriors whose names Culhwch invokes as his sureties when he demands entry to King Arthur&#x27;s court. Second, an elegy (&quot;marwnat&quot;) for &quot;Corroi/Corroy m[ab] Dayry&quot; is preserved in the Book of Taliesin, which mentions his contention with &quot;Cocholyn&quot;, or Cú Chulainn.

<doc id="86266" wikidata="Q2746976" url="?curid=86266" title="List of universities in the United Kingdom">
<text>This is a list of universities in the United Kingdom (alphabetical by substantive name). Below that are lists of university colleges and other recognised bodies (institutions with degree awarding powers), followed by a list of defunct institutions.

== Universities alphabetically ==

This list follows the list of recognised bodies on the UK government website. All the institutions on this list are recognised bodies with university status, indicated either by their use of university title in their name on the recognised bodies list or by reference to the Office for Students database for the few universities that do not use the title in their name. Member institutions of the University of London are listed here if they hold university status.


==University colleges==
:&quot;This is a list of university colleges in the UK&quot;. Institutions included on this list are university colleges that are recognised bodies with their own degree awarding powers; it does not include institutions with &quot;university college&quot; in their title that are listed bodies as parts of a university (see colleges within universities in the United Kingdom), or other institutions with &quot;university college&quot; in their title. Separate citations are given for institutions that have been awarded university college title recently and are not yet shown under that name on the recognised bodies list or which do not use the title in their name.

==Member institutions of the University of London==

All member institutions of the University of London are recognised bodies as institutions that have the right to grant University of London degrees. Some also hold their own degree awarding powers and, since the passing of the University of London Act 2018, can apply for university status in their own right without leaving the federal university. Member institutions that are also universities in their own right are listed both here and in the list of universities above. The university was an examining board until 1900, when it became a federal university and admitted colleges as &quot;Schools of the University&quot;.

 there are 29 &quot;Overseas Higher Education Institutions&quot; that have been approved for student visa purposes by the UK Government as offering &quot;an overseas course of degree level study that&#x27;s equal to a UK higher education course&quot;.

<doc id="86289" wikidata="Q376693" url="?curid=86289" title="Herm (sculpture)">
<text>A herma (, plural ), commonly herm in English, is a sculpture with a head and perhaps a torso above a plain, usually squared lower section, on which male genitals may also be carved at the appropriate height. Hermae were so called either because the head of Hermes was most common or from their etymological connection with the Greek word (, meaning &#x27;blocks of stone&#x27;), which originally had no reference to Hermes at all. The form originated in ancient Greece, and was adopted by the Romans (called mercuriae), and revived at the Renaissance in the form of term figures and atlantes.

==Origin==
In the earliest times Greek divinities were worshipped in the form of a heap of stones or a shapeless column of stone or wood. In many parts of Greece there were piles of stones by the sides of roads, especially at their crossings, and on the boundaries of lands. The religious respect paid to such heaps of stones, especially at the meeting of roads, is shown by the custom of each passer-by throwing a stone on to the heap or anointing it with oil. Later there was the addition of a head and phallus to the column, which became quadrangular (the number four was sacred to Hermes).

==Uses==

In ancient Greece the statues were thought to ward off harm or evil, an apotropaic function, and were placed at crossings, country borders and boundaries as protection, in front of temples, near to tombs, outside houses, in the gymnasia, palaestrae, libraries, porticoes, and public places, at the corners of streets, on high roads as sign-posts, with distances inscribed upon them. Before his role as protector of merchants and travelers, Hermes was a phallic god, associated with fertility, luck, roads and borders. His name perhaps comes from the word &quot;herma&quot;, referring to a square or rectangular pillar of stone, terracotta, or bronze; a bust of Hermes&#x27; head, usually with a beard, sat on the top of the pillar, and male genitals adorned the base. The surmounting heads were not, however, confined to those of Hermes; those of other gods and heroes, and even of distinguished mortals, were of frequent occurrence. In this case a compound was formed: &quot;Hermathena&quot; (a herm of Athena), &quot;Hermares&quot; (of Ares), &quot;Hermherakles&quot; (of Herakles), &quot;Hermaphroditus&quot; (of Aphrodite—not to be confused with the son of Hermes and Aphrodite with the same name, &quot;Hermaphroditus&quot;, who had the genitals of both sexes), &quot;Hermanubis&quot;, &quot;Hermalcibiades&quot;, and so on. In Athens, where the &quot;hermai&quot; were most numerous and most venerated, they were placed outside houses as apotropes for good luck. They would be rubbed or anointed with olive oil and adorned with garlands or wreaths. This superstition persists, for example the bronze boar of Florence (and numerous others like it around the world), where the nose is shiny from being continually touched for good luck or fertility.

In Roman and Renaissance versions (&quot;termini&quot;), the body was often shown from the waist up. The form was also used for portrait busts of famous public figures, especially writers like Socrates and Plato. Anonymous female figures were often used from the Renaissance on, when herms were often attached to walls as decoration.

==Trial of Alcibiades==
In 415 BC, on a night shortly before the Athenian fleet was about to set sail for Syracuse as part of the Sicilian Expedition of the Peloponnesian War, all of the Athenian &quot;hermai&quot; were vandalized. Many people at the time thought such an impious act would threaten the success of the expedition.

Though it was never proven, the Athenians at the time believed it was the work of saboteurs, either from Syracuse or Spartan sympathizers from Athens itself; one suspect was the writer Xenophon. Enemies of Alcibiades, using the anger of the Athenians as a pretext to investigate further desecrations, accused him of other acts of impiety, including mutilations of other sacred objects and mocking performances of religious mystery ceremonies. He denied the accusations and offered to stand trial, but the Athenians did not want to disrupt the expedition any further, and his opponents wanted to use his absence to incite the people against him at a time when he would not be able to defend himself.

Once he had left on the expedition, his political enemies had him charged and sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot;, both for the mutilation of the hermai, and the supposedly related crime of profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries.

==Art and popular culture==
In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Hipparchus&quot;, Socrates attributes the existence of these statues to Hipparchus. They were meant to educate the people in the country, outside of Athens, and make them admire Hipparchus&#x27; wisdom over the wisdom of the Delphic inscriptions. Hence he ordered the carvings of the following two inscriptions: &quot;This is a memorial to Hipparchus: Walk thinking just thoughts&quot; and &quot;This is a memorial to Hipparchus: Don&#x27;t deceive a friend&quot; (229a–b). Socrates is making fun of Hipparchus, and his interlocutor, by this account.

The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles has a large collection of Roman Herma boundary marker stones in its stored collection.

An Aesop&#x27;s fable makes fun of a statue of Hermes. When a pious dog offers to &quot;anoint&quot; it, the god hastily assures his worshipper that this is not necessary.

In the fantasy novel &quot;Lud-in-the-mist&quot; by Hope Mirrlees the main character unearths an important object by digging beneath an object called both a &quot;berm&quot; and a &quot;herm&quot;. It is described as &quot;the tree yet not a tree, the man yet not a man&quot;.

<text>The first record in the [[100 metres]] for men (athletics) was recognised by the International Amateur Athletics Federation, now known as World Athletics, in 1912.

, the IAAF had ratified 67 records in the event, not including rescinded records.

==Unofficial progression before the IAAF==


==IAAF record progression==

&quot;Wind&quot; in these tables refers to wind assistance, the velocity of the wind &quot;parallel&quot; to the runner - positive values are from the starting line towards the finish line, negative are from the finish line towards the starting line, 0 is no wind in either direction, and all values are measured in metres per second. Any wind &quot;perpendicular&quot; to the runners (from left to right, right to left, or up to down or down to up, although the conditions of the track generally preclude those wind directions) is &quot;ignored&quot; and not listed.

&quot;Auto&quot; refers to automatic timing, and for the purposes of these lists, indicates auto times which were either also taken for hand-timed records, or were rounded to the tenth or hundredth of a second (depending on the rounding rules then in effect) for the official record time.

===Records 1912–1976===

The first manual time of 9.9 seconds was recorded for Bob Hayes in the final of the 100 metres at the 1964 Olympics. Hayes&#x27; official time of 10.0 seconds was determined by rounding down the electronic time of 10.06 to the nearest tenth of a second, giving the appearance of a manual time. This method was unique to the Olympics of 1964 and 1968, and the officials at the track recorded Hayes&#x27; time as 9.9 seconds.

===Records since 1977===
Since 1975, the IAAF has accepted separate automatically electronically timed records for events up to 400 metres. Starting on January 1, 1977, the IAAF has required fully automatic timing to the hundredth of a second for these events.

Jim Hines&#x27; October 1968 Olympic gold medal run was the fastest recorded fully electronic 100 metre race up to that date, at 9.95 seconds. &quot;Track and Field News&quot; has compiled an unofficial list of automatically timed records starting with the 1964 Olympics and Bob Hayes&#x27; gold medal performance there. Those marks are included in the progression.

The event is linked on some of the dates. 

===Low-altitude record progression 1968–1987===

The IAAF considers marks set at high altitude as acceptable for record consideration. However, high altitude can significantly assist sprint performances. One estimate suggests times in the 200 m sprint can be assisted by between 0.09s and 0.14s with the maximum allowable tailing wind of 2.0 m/s, and gain 0.3s at altitudes over 2000m. For this reason, unofficial low-altitude record lists have been compiled.

After the IAAF started to recognise only electronic times in 1977, the then-current record and subsequent record were both set at altitude. It was not until 1987 that the world record was equalled or surpassed by a low-altitude performance. The following progression of low-altitude records therefore starts with Hines&#x27;s low-altitude &quot;record&quot; when the IAAF started to recognise only electronic timing in 1977, and continues to Lewis&#x27;s low-altitude performance that equalled the high-altitude world record in 1987. (Ben Johnson&#x27;s 9.95 run in 1986 and 9.83 run in 1987 are omitted.)

<doc id="86314" wikidata="Q172964" url="?curid=86314" title="Goalkeeper">
<text>In many team sports that involve scoring goals, the goalkeeper (sometimes termed goaltender, netminder, GK, goalie, or keeper) is a designated player charged with directly preventing the opposing team from scoring by blocking or intercepting opposing shots on goal. Such positions exist in bandy, rink bandy, camogie, association football, Gaelic football, international rules football, floorball, handball, hurling, field hockey, ice hockey, roller hockey, lacrosse, ringette, rinkball, water polo, and shinty, as well as in other sports.

In most sports that involve scoring in a net, rules apply to the goalkeeper that do not apply to other players. These rules are often instituted to protect the goalkeeper from being a target for dangerous or even violent actions. This is most apparent in sports such as ice hockey and lacrosse, where goalkeepers are required to wear special equipment like heavy pads and a face mask to protect their bodies from the impact of the playing object (e.g., a ball or puck).

In some sports, goalkeepers may have the same rights as other players; in association football, for example, the keeper is allowed to kick the ball just as any other player but may also use their hands to handle the ball in a restricted area. In other sports, goalkeepers may be limited in the actions they are allowed to take or the area of the field or rink where they may be; in the NHL, for example, goalkeepers may not play the puck in the restricted areas behind the net or take the puck across the red line.

In some sports, like Cycle ball, there is no designated goalkeeper, but any player can perform that function on the condition that only one player acts as a goalkeeper at a time.

In some sports, like basketball, acting as a goalkeeper is considered a foul.

==Examples==
===Football codes===

==== Association football ====
In football, each team&#x27;s goalkeeper (GK) defends their team&#x27;s goal and has special privileges within the game. The goalkeeper&#x27;s main job is to stop any penetration of the ball into the goal. The goalkeeper is the only player in the side who may use their hands and arms to catch, throw, and save the ball, but only within their own penalty area. Goalkeepers are required to wear a distinctive color jersey, separate from the referee&#x27;s jersey color and either team&#x27;s regular jersey color, so the referee can easily identify them. There are no other specific requirements, but goalkeepers are usually allowed to wear additional protective gear, such as padded clothing. Most goalkeepers also wear gloves to protect their hands and enhance their grip on the ball. Like every player on the pitch, they are required to wear shin guards.

The goalkeeper is allowed to catch the ball and is also allowed to punch or deflect the ball away from the goal. The goalkeeper generally has a significant advantage on a ball high in the air by raising their arms and play the ball before an attacker can attempt a header. When the keeper picks up the ball, they are allowed to kick it or throw it, or to place it on the ground and play it with their feet. The official Laws of the Game stipulate that the goalkeeper must redistribute the ball within six seconds after picking it up; however, referees often use their discretion as long as the goalkeeper is not obviously attempting to waste time. Once the keeper establishes possession of the ball, opposing players are not allowed to attempt to play the ball and must give the goalkeeper room to attempt a kick. Referees usually give an advantage to an unprotected goalkeeper if a ball is in the air and both the goalkeeper and a field player of the opposing team are challenging for the ball.

The 1936 death of Sunderland A.F.C. goalkeeper Jimmy Thorpe shaped the development of the rule by which players were no longer allowed to raise their foot to a goalkeeper with control of the ball in their arms. Despite winning the league that season, Sunderland&#x27;s season was marked with tragedy after the young goalkeeper died as a result of a kick in the head and chest after he had picked up the ball following a backpass in a game against Chelsea at Roker Park. He continued to take part until the match finished, but collapsed at home afterwards and died in hospital four days later from diabetes mellitus and heart failure &#x27;accelerated by the rough usage of the opposing team&#x27;.

Though the goalkeeper is generally allowed to use their hands in the penalty area, they are not allowed to use their hands on balls that have been deliberately kicked to them by a teammate (it does not have to go backwards). In such situations, the goalkeeper may play the ball with their feet but cannot pick it up. The rule applies only to a ball that is kicked. A ball that is headed or otherwise not kicked may be picked up by the goalkeeper without penalty. An infringement of this rule results in an indirect kick for the opposing team. A ball that is merely deflected by a teammate may still be picked up by the goalkeeper since a deflection is not a deliberate play. The &quot;back-pass&quot; rule has been followed in international football and in most professional and amateur leagues since the early 1990s, but leagues for younger players may choose not to enforce the rule . The back pass rule is listed in Law 12 of the Laws of the Game.

As the goalkeeper is usually the team&#x27;s only player who can see the entire field, they often act as the organizer of the team when it is defending, such as on a free kick or a corner kick. This means the goalkeeper needs to be loud, with a voice that can project over the defensive area of the pitch. In turn, the players on their team need to be able to listen and respond to directions given to them. Some of the greatest soccer/ football goalies include Petr Cech, Peter Schmeichel, Manuel Neuer, Oliver Kahn, Edwin van der Sar, Lev Yashin, Gianluigi Buffon, Jean-Marie Pfaff, Ricardo Zamora or Michel Preud&#x27;homme.

==== Gaelic football ====
In Gaelic football, the goalie&#x27;s main task is to prevent a goal from being scored against his side by directly defending the team&#x27;s goal. A goal occurs when the ball passes through the goal; the attacking team is awarded 3 points. The goalie is the only player who may handle the ball on the ground, and only inside the small rectangle. 

==== International rules football ====
In International rules football, a hybrid game between Australian rules football (which does not have a goalkeeper) and Gaelic football, the goalkeeper&#x27;s main task is to prevent a goal from being scored. A goal occurs when the ball comes off any part of an attacking player and passes through the goal; the attacking team is awarded 6 points.

==== Gridiron football ====
The term &quot;goal-tend&quot; was used in early descriptions of American football positions to describe the defensive position farthest back from the line of scrimmage. Eventually the term became obsolete and was replaced by the term &quot;defensive fullback&quot;, then to its modern term &quot;free safety&quot; (or &quot;punt returner&quot; in kicking situations) . Unlike in soccer or Gaelic football, the goal-tend/safety does not physically protect the goalposts, as they are elevated above the ground and mostly out of the reach of any player (the National Football League also explicitly outlawed goaltending in 1985; no such rule exists in other levels of the game ). Also, unlike other codes of football, goal-tends have no special ball-handling privileges.

One situation in which a goalkeeper-like responsibility can arise is in Canadian football, where a single point is awarded for a kicked ball that is not returned out of the end zone. While standard practice is for defending teams to concede the single point, situations often arise where conceding that point could jeopardize a lead. A goal-tend can thus be employed to recover the ball and either return it out of the end zone or, generally if it is in the closing seconds of a game, punt the ball back into play or out of bounds to ensure the point is not conceded.

=== Handball ===
In handball, the goalkeeper is the only player in the team who is allowed to stay in the 6-meter zone throughout the whole competition. A goalkeeper is allowed to save the ball with all parts of their body, including two hands, trunks, two legs and so on, only within the defending 6-meter zone.

Whenever the ball is left on the ground within the 6-meter zone, the goalkeeper owns the possession of the ball; while whenever the ball is in the air above the 6-meter zone, the opponent can still jump in to grasp the ball without stepping in the 6-meter zone.

A goalkeeper can participate in offense by long-passing the ball to a teammate in the opposing half court for a fast-break score. The common handball goalkeeper clothing includes a long-sleeve jersey, long trousers, and any body protection (such as base layer or protective cup) .

==== Czech handball ====

In Czech handball the goalkeeper is the only player allowed kick the ball during play, and only if defending a shot inside the goal area (other players may only have contact with the ball above the knee). Attackers may enter the goal area but not shoot from inside it. The goalkeeper may not enter the other team&#x27;s defensive third. Goalkeepers take penalty throws when the ball goes out of play behind their goal area with no deflection from the goal. The referee must allow a change of goalkeepers before penalty and free throws. Goalkeepers must wear a different colour jersey from the other players.

=== Hockey ===

==== Bandy ====

In bandy, the goalkeeper defends their team&#x27;s goal and has specific privileges within the game, which is regulated in section 6 of the Bandy Playing Rules set up by the Federation of International Bandy The goalkeeper&#x27;s main job is to stop any penetration of the ball into the goal. The goalkeeper is allowed to hold the ball for six seconds before they have to release it. They may drop it to a defender or chuck it directly into attack.

If the ball passes the goal line, it is followed by different actions: if a defender last touches the ball, the reaction is an own goal if the ball goes between the goalposts; if it passes outside the goalposts, the reaction is a corner stroke. If last touched by an attacker&#x27;s stick and passes between the posts, the reaction is a goal or a disallowed goal (offside or an infringement from the attacking team). If the ball passes from an attacker over the goal line outside the goalposts, the goalkeeper may retrieve a new ball from a cage hanging on the goal&#x27;s either side and put the new ball in play with no signal from the referees.

The goalkeeper is the only player who may use their hands to play the ball (although only within their own penalty area). According to Rule 6.1 the goalkeeper is required to wear a jersey with a different color from either team&#x27;s jersey color to avoid confusion for the referee. Goalkeepers wear padded gloves to aid in catching the ball, large shinpads, a padded sweater, and a helmet with a face mask.

The goalkeeper is the only player in the team who can pass the ball to a teammate by aid of their skates. The team might have a reserve goalkeeper, and the two may switch at any time during the game, without the need to notify the referee. There is no time-out in bandy, but an exception is sometimes made when the goalkeeper is hurt, especially if they don&#x27;t have a designated reserve keeper.

As the goalkeeper is usually the team&#x27;s only player who can see the entire field, they often act as an organizer of the team when it is defending, especially for free strokes against them.

==== Broomball ====
The role of the &quot;goalie&quot; or &quot;goaltender&quot; in Broomball is to prevent the ball from entering the net using their broom and body. In official games they must wear a face protector and helmet in addition to the normal protective clothing used in the game. They are additionally allowed to use one blocker glove and leg guards. Most goaltender privileges only apply when inside the goal area, for example being allowed to close their hand over the ball or send it out of play. Goaltenders are not sent to the penalty bench for infractions; instead, another team member is nominated to take their place. Goaltenders may not cross the centre line or play the ball across it. Goaltender substitutions may be made at any stoppage as often as desired.

==== Field hockey ====

In field hockey, the goalkeeper generally wears extensive protective equipment including helmet, face and neck guards, chest and leg padding, arm or elbow protectors, specific gloves (the left glove is designed purely to block the ball, the right glove also has this function but in addition is designed to permit the goalkeeper to hold and use his or her stick), lower leg guards (known as pads) and shoe covers (known as kickers). The gloves, pads and kickers are almost always made of special high density foam material that both protects the goalkeeper and has excellent rebound qualities. The goalkeeper is also equipped with a stick; either one designed for goalies or one as used for normal play. Specialist goalkeeper sticks must conform to the same dimensional limitations as field players&#x27; sticks but are designed for optimal use with one hand and for blocking rather than hitting the ball. From 2007 teams may elect to play with 11 field players, and no-one has the privileges of a goalkeeper. If a goalkeeper is used, they fall into one of two categories: a fully equipped goalkeeper must wear a helmet, unless they are nominated to take a penalty stroke against the opposing goalkeeper, wear a different colored shirt and at least foot and leg guards (arm and upper-body protection is optional); or they may opt to wear only a helmet. The goalkeeper is allowed to use any part of their body to play or deflect the ball, although they can&#x27;t obstruct its play (for example by lying on top of it), and they can only do so within the goal circle (or &quot;D&quot;). Outside the D they are subject to the same rules as field players and may only use their stick to play the ball. Goalkeepers who are wearing a helmet are not permitted to pass their team&#x27;s 23 m line, with the exception of goalkeepers who take penalty strokes. However, a goalkeeper who has elected to wear only a helmet is permitted to remove it and provided it is not left on the field of play, they may take part in the game in any part of the pitch, and retain their goalkeeping privileges, even if they do not have time to replace the helmet before making a save. It is compulsory to wear a helmet when defending a penalty stroke or penalty corner.

==== Floorball ====

In floorball, the goalkeeper defends their team&#x27;s goal and has specific rules to follow within the game. The goalkeeper is the only player who may use their hands to play the ball. Goalkeepers do not have sticks, and they move in the goal crease on their knees, attempting to save the shots on goal. When the goalkeeper has possession of the ball, they have 3 seconds to throw it back into the game. The goalkeeper may not control the ball outside of his crease, except when kicking it. Goalkeepers are an essential part of starting plays, as they can throw the ball for a quick offensive chance. When throwing, the ball has to touch the goalkeeper&#x27;s own side first before crossing the center line. Goalkeepers are also important in organizing their team&#x27;s games, as they see the whole field better. Any contact against the goalkeeper (slashing, interference etc.) will result in a free shot or a 2-minute penalty. Like in ice hockey, the goalkeeper may be substituted for an extra attacker, if a delayed penalty occurs, or if his team needs a goal to tie the game in the final moments of the game. Goalkeepers may score goals, although this is not the case in some leagues. In floorball games, more goals are often scored than in, for example, ice hockey, because of the extremely quick tempo of the game and fast shots.

The only mandatory equipment for goalkeepers are masks, goalie-shirts, goalie-pants and shoes. Most goalkeepers also wear gloves. They may also optionally wear other protective equipment, such as knee pads, elbow-guards, shin-guards, jocks and torso armor. In some junior/independent leagues, many goalkeepers don&#x27;t even wear goalie-shirts, but hooded tops .

==== Ice hockey ====
In ice hockey, goalkeepers are more commonly referred to as &quot;goaltenders&quot; or simply &quot;goalies&quot;. They defend their team&#x27;s goal zone (net) by stopping shots of the puck from entering the net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the &quot;goal crease&quot; (often referred to simply as the&quot; crease&quot; or &quot;the net&quot;). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears specific equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact . As is true with most other sports, only one goaltender is allowed to be on the playing area for each team at any one time.

=== Hurling ===

In hurling, the goalkeeper&#x27;s main task is to prevent a goal from being scored against their side by directly defending the team&#x27;s goal. The goalkeeper also takes &quot;puckouts&quot; after a score or wide ball. A goal occurs when the ball passes through the goal; the attacking team is awarded 3 points. The goalkeeper has one specific rule pertaining to him, opposing players may not directly physically challenge the goalkeeper while they are in possession of the ball in the small parallelogram, while if the goalkeeper leaves the small parallelogram, they are subject to the same rules as all other players. The goalkeeper wears a different color jersey, e.g., if a team has blue jerseys with white font, the goalkeeper will wear a white jersey of the same design with blue font. Most goalkeepers use a specific hurley with a wider &quot;bas&quot; (flat face) to aid shot-stopping .

===Lacrosse===
====Box lacrosse====
Since the creation of indoor or box lacrosse in the 1930s, a unique form of lacrosse goaltender was formed for the different dynamics of lacrosse on an ice-less ice hockey pad.

====Field lacrosse====

In men&#x27;s field lacrosse, the designated goalkeeper is allowed to have a stick from 40inches to 72inches long and the head of a goalkeeper&#x27;s crosse may measure up to 12inches wide. This is significantly larger than field players&#x27; heads to assist in blocking shots. Once a goalkeeper makes a save and has control of the ball in his crosse (stick), he may only remain in possession of the ball inside the protective crease for four seconds (the length may depend on the level of play). Before the four seconds is up, the goalkeeper must either pass the ball or leave the crease. After leaving, he may not re-enter the crease with possession of the ball.

While inside the crease (nine feet in radius), offensive players may not make contact with the goalie or his stick. Doing so is declared &quot;goalie interference&quot; and is penalized by a free clear to the half field line. There is a significant difference between NCAA/MLL rules and international rules regarding a pass while the goalkeeper is inside the crease: under NCAA/MLL rules, contact with a goalie&#x27;s stick while in the act of passing, even after the ball is released, is prohibited and considered interference. Under international rules, protection ends when possession ends . Contact with a goalie&#x27;s stick after the ball is released, is legal. A goalie is allowed to make contact with the ball with his hand, although he is not allowed to control it or pick it up.

In women&#x27;s lacrosse, once a goalkeeper makes a save and has control of the ball in her crosse, she may remain in possession of the ball inside the crease for ten seconds. The interference rule is similar to men&#x27;s lacrosse; unlike in the men&#x27;s game, a woman goalkeeper is allowed to control or even pick up the ball in her hand.

In both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse, goalkeepers are required to wear a helmet and 4-point chinstrap, a throat protector, gloves, and a chest protector. Use of a protective cup is, for obvious reasons, required in the men&#x27;s game; thigh pads and shin guards are also being required for women goalkeepers as of 2007 . Although they are permitted to, few goalkeepers elect to wear optional protective equipment, including elbow and shoulder pads, thigh pads and shin guards, and long sweatpants.

=== Netball ===
In netball, the role of the Goal Keeper (denoted GK) is to prevent opposing players from shooting. This can be done by deflecting and intercepting passes and shots, collecting rebound balls from failed shots, and strategically influencing opposing players&#x27; positions in the shooting circle. Only the positions Goalkeeper and Goal Defence are allowed within the opposing shooting circle, from within which all scoring shots must be taken by the other team&#x27;s Goal Attack and Goal Shooter. The Goal Keeper usually defends the opposing team&#x27;s Goal Shooter. In accordance with the general rules of netball, the Goalkeeper must be a minimum of three feet away from the landing foot position of a player in possession of the ball when attempting to block, otherwise an obstruction penalty pass/shot is awarded to the other side&#x27;s player in which the Goal Keeper must stand by the player&#x27;s side and out of play until the ball is thrown. The Goal Keeper must stay within the defensive third of the court.

===Shinty===
In shinty and women&#x27;s shinty the goalkeeper is the only player allowed to touch the ball with their hands. However, this does not extend to catching or holding the ball and the legal move is described as a &#x27;slap&#x27;, and the exception only applies within the ten yard area. The goalkeeper, like the rest of the players, may also use the caman/stick, the chest, two feet together or one foot on the ground to block the ball. Goalkeepers must wear a different colour jersey from the other players.

===Water polo===
Goalkeepers in water polo are given specific rules to follow when inside the five-meter area including the ability to touch the ball with two hands, the ability to stand, and the ability to punch the ball with a clenched fist. However, the goalkeeper may not cross the half-distance line while non-goalkeeper players can. 

The rule change in 2006, according to the NFHS 2006–2007 swimming/diving and water polo rulebook, made the four and seven-meter lines merge into a five-meter line. A goalie may now, under revised rules, go beyond the 5m line according to the field rules (one hand) and not pass the half line and use two hands.

The new cap rules resulted in a goalie cap must now be in quarters alternating red/dark for home and red/white for away, the goalie must be number 1, 13, or 15, and for females: a red swim cap must be worn under the goalie cap, a team&#x27;s dark swim cap is no longer acceptable as it is hard to distinguish a goalie from field players if the official cap is off. USWP and NCAA rules vary slightly.

The water polo goalkeeper is the least protected goalkeeper without gloves or body protection.

==Goalkeepers on coins and postage stamps==
Goalkeepers are regarded as one of the hardest positions to play therefore they can have a huge impact on a countries culture. Goalkeepers have been used on some collectors&#x27; coins and medals such as the Austrian 5 euro 100 years of football coin that was minted on 12 May 2004. The coin depicts a successful shot by a footballer, shown in the background, with the ball just passing the Austrian goalkeeper, Samuel Ali (still in the air) into the goal.

<doc id="86321" wikidata="Q108908" url="?curid=86321" title="Fluxus">
<text>Fluxus was an international, interdisciplinary community of artists, composers, designers, and poets during the 1960s and 1970s who engaged in experimental art performances which emphasized the artistic process over the finished product. Fluxus is known for experimental contributions to different artistic media and disciplines and for generating new art forms. These art forms include intermedia, a term coined by Fluxus artist Dick Higgins; conceptual art, first developed by Henry Flynt, an artist contentiously associated with Fluxus; and video art, first pioneered by Nam June Paik and Wolf Vostell. Dutch gallerist and art critic Harry Ruhé describes Fluxus as &quot;the most radical and experimental art movement of the sixties&quot;.

They produced performance &quot;events&quot;, which included enactments of scores, &quot;Neo-Dada&quot; noise music, and time-based works, as well as concrete poetry, visual art, urban planning, architecture, design, literature, and publishing. Many Fluxus artists share anti-commercial and anti-art sensibilities. Fluxus is sometimes described as &quot;intermedia&quot;. The ideas and practices of composer John Cage heavily influenced Fluxus, especially his notions that one should embark on an artwork without a conception of its end, and his understanding of the work as a site of interaction between artist and audience. The process of creating was privileged over the finished product. Another notable influence were the readymades of Marcel Duchamp, a French artist who was active in Dada (1916 – ). George Maciunas, largely considered to be the founder of this fluid movement, coined the name Fluxus in 1961 to title a proposed magazine.

Many artists of the 1960s took part in Fluxus activities, including Joseph Beuys, Willem de Ridder, George Brecht, John Cage, Robert Filliou, Al Hansen, Dick Higgins, Bengt af Klintberg, Alison Knowles, Addi Køpcke, Yoko Ono, Nam June Paik, Shigeko Kubota, La Monte Young, Mary Bauermeister, Joseph Byrd, Ben Patterson, Daniel Spoerri, Eric Andersen (artist), Ken Friedman, Terry Riley and Wolf Vostell. Not only were they a diverse community of collaborators who influenced each other, they were also, largely, friends. They collectively had what were, at the time, radical ideas about art and the role of art in society. Fluxus founder George Maciunas proposed a well known manifesto, but few considered Fluxus to be a true movement, and therefore the manifesto was not largely adopted. Instead, a series of festivals in Wiesbaden, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Amsterdam, London, and New York, gave rise to a loose but robust community with many similar beliefs. In keeping with the reputation Fluxus earned as a forum of experimentation, some Fluxus artists came to describe Fluxus as a laboratory.

==Early History, Late 50s to 1965==

===Origins===
The origins of Fluxus lie in many of the concepts explored by composer John Cage in his experimental music of the 1930s through the 1960s. After attending courses on Zen Buddhism taught by D. T. Suzuki, Cage taught a series of classes in experimental composition from 1957 to 1959 at the New School for Social Research in New York City. These classes explored the notions of chance and indeterminacy in art, using music scores as a basis for compositions that could be performed in potentially infinite ways. Some of the artists and musicians who became involved in Fluxus, including Jackson Mac Low, La Monte Young, George Brecht, Al Hansen, and Dick Higgins attended Cage&#x27;s classes. A major influence is found in the work of Marcel Duchamp. Also of importance was &quot;Dada Poets and Painters&quot;, edited by Robert Motherwell, a book of translations of Dada texts that was widely read by members of Fluxus. The term anti-art, a precursor to Dada, was coined by Duchamp around 1913, when he created his first readymades from found objects (ordinary objects found or purchased and declared art). Indifferently chosen, readymades and altered readymades challenged the notion of art as an inherently optical experience, dependent on academic art skills. The most famous example is Duchamp&#x27;s altered readymade &quot;Fountain&quot; (1917), a work which he signed &quot;R. Mutt.&quot; While taking refuge from WWI in New York, in 1915 Duchamp formed a Dada group with Francis Picabia and American artist Man Ray. Other key members included Arthur Cravan, Florine Stettheimer, and the Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, credited by some with proposing the idea for Fountain to Duchamp. By 1916 these artists, especially Duchamp, Man Ray, and Picabia, became the center for radical anti-art activities in New York City. Their artworks would inform Fluxus and conceptual art in general. In the late 1950s and very early 1960s, Fluxus and contemporaneous groups or movements, including Happenings, Nouveau réalisme, mail art, and action art in Japan, Austria, and other international locations were, often placed under the rubric of Neo-Dada&quot;.

A number of other contemporary events are credited as either anticipating Fluxus or as constituting proto-Fluxus events. The most commonly cited include the series of Chambers Street loft concerts, in New York, curated by Yoko Ono and La Monte Young in 1961, featuring pieces by Ono, Jackson Mac Low, Joseph Byrd, and Henry Flynt; the month-long &quot;Yam&quot; festival held in upstate New York by George Brecht and Robert Watts in May 1963 with Ray Johnson and Allan Kaprow (the culmination of a year&#x27;s worth of Mail Art pieces); and a series of concerts held in Mary Bauermeister&#x27;s studio, Cologne, 1960–61, featuring Nam June Paik and John Cage among many others. It was at one of these events in 1960, during his Etude pour Piano, that Paik leapt into the audience and cut John Cage&#x27;s tie off, ran out of the concert hall, and then phoned the hall&#x27;s organisers to announce the piece had ended. As one of the movement&#x27;s founders, Dick Higgins, stated:
Fluxus started with the work, and then came together, applying the name Fluxus to work which already existed. It was as if it started in the middle of the situation, rather than at the beginning.
===From the Neo-Dada Anthology of Chance Operations to Early Fluxus===
In 1961 the American musician/artist La Monte Young had been enlisted to guest-edit an East Coast issue of the Wast Coast literary journal &quot;Beatitude&quot; to be called &quot;Beatitude East&quot;. But as the &quot;Beatitude&quot; connection was prematurly terminated, George Maciunas, a trained graphic designer, asked Young if he could layout and help publish the Neo-Dada material. Maciunas supplied the paper, design, and some money for publishing the anthology which contained the work of New York avant-garde artists from that time. The project took the title of &quot;An Anthology of Chance Operations&quot; from its full title &quot;An Anthology of chance operations concept art anti-art indeterminacy improvisation meaningless work natural disasters plans of action stories diagrams Music poetry essays dance constructions mathematics compositions&quot;. &quot;An Anthology of Chance Operations&quot; was completed and published in 1963 by Jackson Mac Low and La Monte Young, as Maciunas had by then moved to Germany to escape his creditors. After opening a short-lived art gallery on Madison Avenue, which showed work by Dick Higgins, Yoko Ono, Jonas Mekas, Ray Johnson, Henry Flynt and La Monte Young, Maciunas moved to Wiesbaden, West Germany, having taken a job as a graphic designer with the US Air Force in late 1961 after the gallery had gone bust. From Wiesbaden, Maciunas continued his contact with Young and other New York City-based artists and with expatriate American artists like Benjamin Patterson and Emmett Williams, whom he met in Europe. By September 1962, Maciunas was joined by Dick Higgins and Alison Knowles who traveled to Europe to help him promote a second planned publication to be called Fluxus, the first of a series of &quot;yearbooks&quot; of artists&#x27; works. Maciunas had first come up with the title &quot;Fluxus&quot; for a never done anthology of New York&#x27;s Lithuanian artists, but instead applied the term to artists working in the &quot;Anthology of Chance Operations&quot; vein. Because after fleeing Lithuania at the end of World War II, his family settled in New York, where he first met the group of avant-garde artists and musicians centered around John Cage and La Monte Young. Thus Maciunas coined the name &quot;Fluxus&quot; not for his perceived group of Lithuania artists but for the Neo-Dada art being produced by a range of artists with a shared sensibility as an attempt to &quot;fuse... cultural, social, &amp; political revolutionaries into [a] united front and action&quot;. 

Maciunas first publicly coined the term &quot;Fluxus&quot; (meaning &#x27;to flow&#x27;) in a &#x27;brochure prospectus&#x27; that he distributed to the audience at a festival he had organized, called &quot;Après Cage; Kleinen Sommerfest&quot; (After Cage; a Small Summer Festival), in Wuppertal, West Germany, 9 June 1962.

Maciunas was an avid art historian, and initially referred to fluxus as &#x27;neo-dadaism&#x27; or &#x27;renewed dadaism&#x27;. He wrote a number of letters to Raoul Hausmann, an original dadaist, outlining his ideas. Hausmann discouraged the use of the term;

I note with much pleasure what you said about German neodadaists—but I think even the Americans should not use the term &quot;neodadaism&quot; because neo means nothing and -ism is old-fashioned. Why not simply &quot;Fluxus&quot;? It seems to me much better, because it&#x27;s new, and dada is historic.

As part of the festival, Maciunas wrote a lecture entitled &#x27;Neo-Dada in the United States&#x27;. After an attempt to define &#x27;Concretist Neo-Dada&#x27; art, he explained that Fluxus was opposed to the exclusion of the everyday from art. Using &#x27;anti-art and artistic banalities&#x27;, Fluxus would fight the &#x27;traditional artificialities of art&#x27;. The lecture ended with the declaration &quot;Anti-art is life, is nature, is true reality—it is one and all.&quot;

===European festivals and the Fluxkits===

In 1962, Maciunas, Higgins and Knowles traveled to Europe to promote the planned Fluxus publication with concerts of antique musical instruments. With the help of a group of artists including Joseph Beuys and Wolf Vostell, Maciunas eventually organised a series of &quot;Fluxfests&quot; across Western Europe. Starting with 14 concerts between 1 and 23 September 1962, at Wiesbaden, these &quot;Fluxfests&quot; presented work by musicians such as John Cage, Ligeti, Penderecki, Terry Riley and Brion Gysin alongside performance pieces written by Higgins, Knowles, George Brecht and Nam June Paik, Ben Patterson, Robert Filliou, and Emmett Williams, amongst many others. One performance in particular, &quot;Piano Activities&quot; by Philip Corner, became notorious by challenging the important status of the piano in post-war German homes.

The score—which asks for any number of performers to, among other things, &quot;play&quot;, &quot;pluck or tap&quot;, &quot;scratch or rub&quot;, &quot;drop objects&quot; on, &quot;act on strings with&quot;, &quot;strike soundboard, pins, lid or drag various kinds of objects across them&quot; and &quot;act in any way on underside of piano&quot;—resulted in the total destruction of a piano when performed by Maciunas, Higgins and others at Wiesbaden. The performance was considered scandalous enough to be shown on German television four times, with the introduction &quot;The lunatics have escaped!&quot;
At the end we did Corner&#x27;s &quot;Piano Activities&quot; not according to his instructions since we systematically destroyed a piano which I bought for $5 and had to have it all cut up to throw it away, otherwise we would have had to pay movers, a very practical composition, but German sentiments about this &quot;instrument of Chopin&quot; were hurt and they made a row about it...

At the same time, Maciunas used his connections at work to start printing cheap mass-produced books and multiples by some of the artists that were involved in the performances. The first three to be printed were &quot;Composition 1961&quot; by La Monte Young (see it here, &quot;An Anthology of Chance Operations&quot; edited by Young and Mac Low and &quot;Water Yam&quot;, by George Brecht. &quot;Water Yam&quot;, a series of event scores printed on small sheets of card and collected together in a cardboard box, was the first in a series of artworks that Maciunas printed that became known as &quot;Fluxkits&quot;. Cheap, mass-produced and easily distributed, &quot;Fluxkits&quot; were originally intended to form an ever-expanding library of modern performance art. &quot;Water Yam&quot; was published in an edition of 1000 and originally cost $4. By April 1964, almost a year later, Maciunas still had 996 copies unsold.

Maciunas&#x27; original plan had been to design, edit and pay for each edition himself, in exchange for the copyright to be held by the collective. Profits were to be split 80/20 at first, in favor of the artist. Since most of the composers already had publishing deals, Fluxus quickly moved away from music toward performance and visual art. John Cage, for instance, never published work under the Fluxus moniker due to his contract with the music publishers Edition Peters.
Maciunas seemed to have a fantastic ability to get things done... if you had things to be printed he could get them printed. It&#x27;s pretty hard in East Brunswick to get good offset printing. It&#x27;s not impossible, but it&#x27;s not so easy, and since I&#x27;m very lazy it was a relief to find somebody who could take the burden off my hands. So there was this guy Maciunas, a Lithuanian or Bulgarian, or somehow a refugee or whatever—beautifully dressed—&quot;astonishing looking&quot; would be a better adjective. He was somehow able to carry the whole thing off, without my having to go 57 miles to find a printer.

Since Maciunas was colorblind, Fluxus multiples were almost always black and white.

===New York and the FluxShops===

After his contract with the US Air Force was terminated due to ill health, Maciunas was forced to return to the US on 3 September 1963. Once back in New York, he set about organizing a series of street concerts and opened a new shop, the &#x27;Fluxhall&#x27;, on Canal Street.
12 concerts, &quot;away from the beaten track of the New York art scene&quot;, took place on Canal Street, 11 April to 23 May 1964. With photographs taken by Maciunas himself, pieces by Ben Vautier, Alison Knowles and Takehisa Kosugi were performed in the street for free, although in practice there was &#x27;no audience to speak of&#x27; anyway.

The people in Fluxus had understood, as Brecht explained, that &quot;concert halls, theaters, and art galleries&quot; were &quot;mummifying&quot;. Instead, these artists found themselves &quot;preferring streets, homes, and railway stations...&quot; Maciunas recognized a radical political potential in all this forthrightly anti-institutional production, which was an important source for his own deep commitment to it. Deploying his expertise as a professional graphic designer, Maciunas played an important role in projecting upon Fluxus whatever coherence it would later seem to have had.

Along with the New York shop, Maciunas built up a distribution network for the new art across Europe and later outlets in California and Japan. Gallery and mail order outlets were established in Amsterdam, Villefranche-Sur-Mer, Milan and London, amongst others. By 1965, the first anthology &quot;Fluxus 1&quot; was available, consisting of manila envelopes bolted together containing work by numerous artists who would later become famous including La Monte Young, Christo, Joseph Byrd and Yoko Ono. Other pieces available included packs of altered playing cards by George Brecht, sensory boxes by Ay-O, a regular newsletter with contributions by artists and musicians such as Ray Johnson and John Cale, and tin cans filled with poems, songs and recipes about beans by Alison Knowles (see).

===Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Originale&quot;===

After returning to New York, Maciunas became reacquainted with Henry Flynt, who encouraged members of Fluxus to take a more overtly political stance. One of the results of these discussions was to set up a picket line at the American premiere of &quot;Originale&quot;, a recent work by the German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, 8 September 1964. Stockhausen was deemed a &#x27;Cultural Imperialist&#x27; by Maciunas and Flynt, while other members vehemently disagreed. The result was members of Fluxus, such as Nam June Paik and Jackson Mac Low, crossing a picket line made up of other members, including Ben Vautier and Takako Saito who handed out leaflets denouncing Stockhausen as &quot;a characteristic European-North American ruling-class Artist&quot;. Dick Higgins participated in the picket, and then coolly joined the other performers inside;

Maciunas and his friend Henry Flynt tried to get the Fluxus people to march around outside the circus with white cards that said Originale was bad. And they tried to say that the Fluxus people who were in the circus weren&#x27;t Fluxus any more. That was silly, because it made a split. I thought it was funny, and so first I walked around with Maciunas and with Henry with a card, then I went inside and joined the circus; so both groups got angry with me. Oh well. Some people say that Fluxus died that day—I once thought so myself—but it turned out I was wrong.

The event, arranged by Charlotte Moorman as part of her &quot;2nd Annual New York Avant Garde Festival&quot;, would cement animosities between Maciunas and her, with Maciunas frequently demanding that artists associated with Fluxus have nothing to do with the annual festival, and would often expel artists who ignored his demands. This hostility continued throughout Maciunas&#x27; life—much to Moorman&#x27;s bemusement—despite her continued championing of Fluxus art and artists.

==Middle Fluxus History: 1965–78==

===Perceived insurgencies and the Asiatic influence===

The picketing of &quot;Originale&quot; marked the high point of Maciunas&#x27; agitprop approach, an approach that estranged many of Fluxus&#x27; early proponents; Jackson Mac Low had resigned immediately after hearing &#x27;antisocial&#x27; plans laid in April 1963, such as breaking down trucks under the Hudson River. Brecht threatened to quit on the same issue, and then left New York in the spring of 1965. Despite his continued allegiance to Fluxus ideals, Dick Higgins fell out with Maciunas around the same time, ostensibly over his setting up the Something Else Press which printed many texts by key Fluxus-related personalities and other members of the avant garde. Charlotte Moorman continued to present her Annual Avant Garde Festival in New York.

Such perceived insurrections in the coherence of Maciunas&#x27; leadership of Fluxus provided an opening for Fluxus to become increasingly influenced by Japanese members of the group. Since returning to Japan in 1961, Yoko Ono had been recommending colleagues look Maciunas up if they moved to New York; by the time she had returned, in early 1965, Hi Red Center, Shigeko Kubota, Takako Saito, Mieko Shiomi, Yasunao Tone and Ay-O had all started to make work for Fluxus, often of a contemplative nature.

In Tokyo Japan 1964 Yoko Ono, a nonconformist to the Fluxus community, independently published her artist’s book &quot;Grapefruit&quot;. The book’s text itself encompassing event scores and other forms of participatory art.

An event score from the book:

Cloud Piece

Imagine the clouds dripping.

Dig a hole in your garden to put them in.

===Proto-Performance Art===

On September 25, 1965, the FluxOrchestra, with La Monte Young conducting, played at Carnegie Recital Hall in New York City with a poster and program designed by George Maciunas. Copies of the program were folded into paper airplanes and launched during the evening, which included performances of &quot;Falling Event&quot; by Chieko Shiomi, &quot;Symphony No. 3 &#x27;On the Floor from &#x27;Clouds Scissors&#x27;&quot; by George Brecht, &quot;4 Pieces for Orchestra to La Monte Young&quot; by Yoko Ono, &quot;Disappearing Music for Face&quot; by Shiomi, &quot;Tactical Pieces for Orchestra&quot; and &quot;Olivetti Adding Machine in Memoriam for Adriano Olivetti&quot; by Anthony Cox, &quot;Trance for Orchestra&quot; by Watts, &quot;Sky Piece to Jesus Christ*&quot; by Ono, &quot;Octet for Winds &#x27;In the Water&#x27; from &#x27;Cloud Scissors&quot; by Brecht, &quot;Piece&quot; by Shigeko Kubota, &quot;1965 $50&quot; by Young, &quot;Piano Piece&quot; by Tomas Schmit, &quot;Sword Piece&quot; by Cox, &quot;Music for Late Afternoon Together With&quot; by Shiomi, &quot;2&quot; by Watts, &quot;c/t Trace&quot; by Watts, &quot;Intermission Event&quot; by Willem de Ridder, &quot;Moviee Music&quot; by Stan Vanderbeek, &quot;Mechanical Orchestra&quot; by Joe Jones, and &quot;Secret Room&quot; by Ben Vautier.

In 1969, Fluxus artist Joe Jones opened his &quot;JJ Music Store&quot; (aka &quot;Tone Deaf Music Store&quot;) at 18 North Moore Street, where he presented his repetitive drone music machines. He created there an installation in the window so that anyone could press numerous door buttons to play the noise music machines displayed there. Jones also presented small musical installation performances there, alone or with other Fluxus artists, such as Yoko Ono and John Lennon, among others. From April 18 to June 12, 1970, Ono and Lennon (aka Plastic Ono Band) presented a series of Fluxus art events and concerts there called &quot;GRAPEFRUIT FLUXBANQUET&quot;. It was promoted with a poster designed by Fluxus leader George Maciunas. Performances included &quot;Come Impersonating John Lennon &amp; Yoko Ono, Grapefruit Banquet&quot; (April 11–17) by George Maciunas, Yoshimasa Wada, Nye Ffarrabas (formerly Bici Forbes and Bici Forbes Hendricks), Geoffrey Hendricks, and Robert Watts; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; (April 11–17) by Yoko Ono; &quot;Tickets by John Lennon + Fluxagents&quot; (April 18–24) with Wada, Ben Vautier and Maciunas; &quot;Clinic by Yoko Ono + Hi Red Center&quot; (April 25-May 1); &quot;Blue Room by Yoko + Fluxmasterliars&quot; (May 2–8); &quot;Weight &amp; Water by Yoko + Fluxfiremen&quot; (May 9–15); &quot;Capsule by Yoko + Flux Space Center&quot; (May 16–22) with Maciunas, Paul Sharits, George Brecht, Ay-O, Ono, Watts, John Cavanaugh; &quot;Portrait of John Lennon as a Young Cloud by Yoko + Everybody&quot; (May 23–29); &quot;The Store by Yoko + Fluxfactory&quot; (May 30-June 5), with Ono, Maciunas, Wada, Ay-O; and finally &quot;Examination by Yoko + Fluxschool&quot; (June 6–12) with Ono, Geoffrey Hendricks, Watts, Mieko Shiomi and Robert Filliou.

===Objects blurring boundaries===
As Fluxus gradually became more famous, Maciunas&#x27; ambitions for the sale of cheap multiples grew. The second flux-anthology, the &quot;Fluxkit&quot; (late 1964), collected together early 3D work made by the collective in a businessman&#x27;s case, an idea borrowed directly from Duchamp&#x27;s &quot;Boite en Valise&quot; Within a year, plans for a new anthology, &quot;Fluxus 2&quot;, were in full swing to contain Flux films by John Cage and Yoko Ono (with hand held projectors provided), disrupted matchboxes and postcards by Ben Vautier, plastic food by Claes Oldenburg, FluxMedicine by Shigeko Kubota (containing empty pill packages), and artworks made of rocks, ink stamps, outdated travel tickets, undoable puzzles and a machine to facilitate humming.

Maciunas&#x27; belief in the collective extended to authorship; a number of pieces from this period were anonymous, mis-attributed, or have had their authorship since questioned. As a further complication, Maciunas was in the habit of dramatically changing ideas submitted by various artists before he put the works into production.
&quot;Solid Plastic in Plastic Box&quot;, credited to Per Kirkeby 1967, for instance, had originally been realised by Kirkeby as a metal box, inscribed &#x27;This Box Contains Wood&#x27;. When opened, the box would be found to contain sawdust. By the time the multiple had been manufactured by Maciunas, it was a block of solid plastic contained in a plastic box of the same color. Conversely, Maciunas assigned &quot;Degree Face Clock&quot;, in which a clock face is measured out in 360°, to Kirkeby despite being an idea by Robert Watts;
Some years ago, when I spoke with Robert Watts about &quot;Degree Face Clock&quot; and &quot;Compass Face Clock&quot;, he had recalled thinking up the idea himself and was surprised that George Maciunas advertised them as Per Kirkeby&#x27;s. Watts shrugged and said that was the way George worked. There would be ideas in the air and Maciunas would assign the piece to one artist or another.
Other tactics from this time included Maciunas buying large amounts of plastic boxes wholesale, and handing them out to artists with the simple request to turn them into Fluxkits, and the use of the rapidly growing international network of artists to contribute items needed to complete works. Robert Watts&#x27; &quot;Fluxatlas&quot;, 1973, for instance, contains small rocks sent by members of the group from around the world.

===Inventing Performance Art===
In addition to his numerous original compositions which have joined the collective&#x27;s catalog of works, Larry Miller, associated with the group since 1969, has also been active as an interpreter of the &quot;classic&quot; scores and responsible for bringing the group&#x27;s works to a wider public, blurring the lines between artist, producer and researcher. Besides Miller&#x27;s own artistic work, he has also organized, reconstructed and performed at numerous Fluxus events and assembled an extensive collection of material on the history of Fluxus. Through Miller, Fluxus attracted media coverage such as the worldwide CNN coverage of &quot;Off Limits&quot; exhibit at Newark Museum, 1999. Other Miller activities as organizer, performer and presenter within the Fluxus milieu include &quot;Performance in Fluxus Continue 1963–2003&quot; at Musee d&#x27;Art et d&#x27;Art Contemporain in Nice; &quot;Fluxus a la Carte&quot; in Amsterdam; and &quot;Centraal Fluxus Festival&quot; at Centraal Museum, Utrecht, Netherlands. In 2004, for Geoff Hendricks&#x27; &quot;Critical Mass: Happenings, Fluxus, Performance, Intermedia and Rutgers University 1958–1972&quot;, Miller reprised and updated the track and field events of the Flux Olympics, first presented in 1970. For &quot;Do-it Yourself Fluxus&quot; at AI – Art Interactive – in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Miller worked as the curatorial consultant for an exhibit of works that allowed viewers hands-on experience including the reconstruction of several sections of the historic &quot;Flux Labyrinth&quot;, a massive and intricate maze that Miller originally constructed with George Maciunas at &quot;Akademie der Künste&quot;, Berlin in 1976 and which included sections by several of the Fluxus artists. Miller created a new version of the &quot;Flux Labyrinth&quot; at the &quot;In the Spirit of Fluxus&quot; exhibit at the Walker Art Center in 1994, where Griel Marcus said, &quot;Miller was... fine tuning the monster.&quot;

=== Feminism ===
Women associated with Fluxus such as Carolee Schneemann and Charlotte Moorman, and founding members of the group such as Alison Knowles and Yoko Ono, contributed works in varying media and with differing content such as Knowles&#x27; &quot;Make a Salad&quot; and &quot;Make a Soup.&quot;. Each was shaped by their times and their associations with artists of the previous generation such as Sari Dienes who were pointing the way to the changes of the 1960s and 70s with strong personnas and art. Some made experimental and performative work having to do with the body that created a powerful female presence, which existed within Fluxus from the group&#x27;s beginning as illustrated by works including Carolee Schneemann&#x27;s &quot;Interior Scroll&quot;, Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;Cut Piece&quot;, and Shigeko Kubota&#x27;s &quot;Vagina Painting&quot;. Women working within Fluxus were often simultaneously critiquing their position within a male dominated society while also exposing the inequalities within an art collective that claimed to be open and diverse. George Maciunas, in his rejection of Schneeman as a member of Fluxus, called her &quot;guilty of Baroque tendencies, overt sexuality, and theatrical excess&quot;. &quot;Interior Scroll&quot; was a response to Schneemann&#x27;s experience as a filmmaker in the 1950s and 1960s, when male filmmakers claimed that women should restrict themselves to dance.
In &quot;An evening with Fluxus women: a roundtable discussion&quot;, hosted at New York University on 19 February 2009 by &quot;Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory&quot; and the Department of Performance Studies, a passage from Mieko Shiomi reads &quot;...the best thing about Fluxus, I think, is that there was no discrimination on the basis of nationality and gender. Fluxus was open to anyone who shared similar thoughts about art and life. That&#x27;s why women artists could be so active without feeling any frustration.&quot;

Shigeo Kubota&#x27;s &quot;Vagina Painting&quot; (1965), was performed by attaching a paintbrush dipped in red paint to her underwear, then applying it to a piece of paper while moving over it in a crouching position. The paint evoked menstrual blood. &quot;Vagina Painting&quot; has been interpreted as a critique of Jackson Pollock&#x27;s action paintings, and the male-dominated abstract expressionist tradition.

===Utopian communities===
A number of artists in the group were interested in setting up Flux communes, intending to &#x27;bridge the gap between the artist community and the surrounding society&#x27; The first of these, La Cédille qui Sourit or &quot;The Cedilla That Smiles&quot;, was set up in Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, by Robert Filliou and George Brecht, 1965–1968. Intended as an &#x27;International Centre of Permanent Creation&#x27;, the shop sold Fluxkits and other small wares as well as housing a &#x27;non-school&#x27;, boasting the motto &quot;A carefree exchange of information and experience. No students, no teachers. Perfect licence, at times to listen at times to talk.&quot; In 1966, Maciunas, Watts and others took advantage of new legislation drafted to regenerate the area of Manhattan known as &#x27;Hell&#x27;s Hundred Acres&#x27;, soon to become rebranded as SoHo, allowing artists to buy live/work spaces in an area that had been blighted due to a proposed 18-lane expressway along Broome Street. Led by Maciunas, plans were laid to start a series of real-estate developments in the area, designed to create an artists&#x27; community within a few streets of the FluxShop on Canal Street. 

&#x27;Maciunas wanted to establish collective workshops, food-buying cooperatives and theaters to link the strengths of various media together and bridge the gap between the artist community and the surrounding society&#x27;

The first warehouse, intended to house Maciunas, Watts, Christo &amp; Jeanne-Claude, Jonas Mekas, La Monte Young and others, was located on Greene Street. Likening these communities to the soviet Kolkhozs, Maciunas didn&#x27;t hesitate to adopt the title &#x27;Chairman of Bldg. Co-Op&#x27; without first registering an office or becoming a member of the New York State Association of Realtors. FluxHousing Co-Operatives continued to redevelop the area over the next decade, and were widened to include plans to set up a &quot;FluxIsland&quot;- a suitable island was located near Antigua, but the money to buy and develop it remained unforthcoming- and finally a performance arts centre called the &quot;FluxFarm&quot; established in New Marlborough, Massachusetts. The plans were continually dogged by financial problems, constant run-ins with the New York authorities, and eventually resulted, on 8 November 1975, in Maciunas being severely beaten by thugs sent by an unpaid electrical contractor.

=== End ===
It is arguably said that Fluxus came to an end when its founder and leader George Maciunas died in 1978 from complications due to pancreatic cancer. Maciunas&#x27; funeral was held in typical Fluxus style where they dubbed the funeral &quot;Fluxfeast and Wake&quot;, ate foods that were only black, white, or purple. Maciunas left behind his thoughts on Fluxus in a series of important video conversations called &quot;Interview With George Maciunas&quot; with Fluxus artist Larry Miller, which has been screened internationally and translated into numerous languages. Over the past 30 years, Miller has shot and collected Fluxus related materials including tapes on Joe Jones, Carolee Schneemann, Ben Vautier, Dick Higgins, and Alison Knowles, in addition to the 1978 Maciunas interview.

==Fluxus since 1978==
Maciunas moved to the Berkshire Mountains in Western Massachusetts in the late 1970s. Two decades earlier, after collecting paintings, the Boston art collector Jean Brown, and her late husband Leonard Brown, began to shift their focus to Dadaist and Surrealist art, manifestoes and periodicals. In 1971, after Mr. Brown&#x27;s death, Mrs. Brown moved to Tyringham, and expanded into areas adjacent to Fluxus, including artists&#x27; books, concrete poetry, happenings, mail art and performance art. Maciunas helped turn her home, originally a Shaker seed house, into an important center for both Fluxus artists and scholars, with Mrs. Brown alternately cooking meals and showing guests her collection. Activities centered on a large archive room on the second floor built by Maciunas, who settled in nearby Great Barrington, where it was discovered that Maciunas developed cancer of the pancreas and liver in 1977.

Three months before his death, he married his friend and companion, the poet Billie Hutching. After a legal wedding in Lee, Massachusetts, the couple performed a &quot;Fluxwedding&quot; in a friend&#x27;s loft in SoHo, 25 February 1978. A videotape of the Maciunas&#x27; wedding was produced by Dimitri Devyatkin. The bride and groom traded clothing. Maciunas died on 9 May 1978 in a hospital in Boston.

After the death of George Maciunas a rift opened in Fluxus between a few collectors and curators who placed Fluxus as an art movement in a specific time frame (1962 to 1978), and the artists themselves, many of whom continued to see Fluxus as a living entity held together by its core values and world view. Different theorists and historians adopted each of these views. Fluxus is therefore referred to variously in the past or the present tense. While the definition of Fluxus was always a subject of controversy, the question is now significantly more complex due to the fact that many of the original artists who were still living when Maciunas died are now dead themselves.

Some have argued that the unique control that curator Jon Hendricks holds over a major historical Fluxus collection (the Gilbert and Lila Silverman collection) has enabled him to influence, through the numerous books and catalogues subsidized by the collection, the view that Fluxus died with Maciunas. Hendricks argues that Fluxus was a historical movement that occurred at a particular time, asserting that such central Fluxus artists as Dick Higgins and Nam June Paik could no longer label themselves as active Fluxus artists after 1978, and that contemporary artists influenced by Fluxus cannot lay claim to be Fluxus artists. The Museum of Modern Art makes the same claim dating the movement to the 1960s and 1970s. However, the influence of Fluxus continues today in multi-media digital art performances. In September, 2011 Other Minds presented a performance at the SOMArts building in San Francisco to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Fluxus. The performance was curated by Adam Fong who was also one of the performers along with Yoshi Wada, Alison Knowles, Hannah Higgins, Luciano Chessa and Adam Overton.

Others, including Hannah Higgins, daughter of fluxus artists Alison Knowles and Dick Higgins, assert that although Maciunas was a key participant, there were many more, including Fluxus co-founder Higgins, who continued to work within Fluxus after the death of Maciunas. The rise of the Internet in the 1990s enabled a vibrant post-Fluxus community to emerge online. After some of the original Fluxus artists from the 1960s and 1970s including Higgins, created online communities such as the Fluxlist, following their departure, younger artists, writers, musicians, and performers have attempted to continue their work in cyberspace. Many of the original Fluxus artists still working enjoy homages by younger Fluxus-influenced artists who stage events to commemorate Fluxus, but discourage the use of the &quot;Fluxus&quot; label by younger artists.

In 2018 the Los Angeles Philharmonic in its &quot;Fluxus Festival&quot; presented a fluxus performance incorporating John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Europeras 1 and 2&quot; directed by Yuval Sharon. Fluxus artists continue to perform today on a smaller scale.

== Influences ==
An immediate predecessor of Fluxus, according to Maciunas, was the Gutai group which promoted art as an anti-academic, psychophysical experience, an &quot;art of matter as it is&quot; as explained by Shiraga Kazuo in 1956. Gutai became connected with a sort of artistic mass-production, anticipating Fluxus&#x27;s trademark, i.e., ambiguity between the cultivated and the trivial, between high and low. Indeed, avant-garde art in Japan tended toward informal rather than conceptual elements, radically opposing the extreme formality and symbolism found in Japanese art.

In the 1950s New York music scene there could be discerned many issues related to the post-war disenchantment experienced by many throughout the developed world. Such disillusionment in itself presented a case for commitment to Buddhism and Zen in everyday matters such as mental attitude, meditation, and approach to food and body care. It was also felt, however, that there was a general need for a more radical artistic sensibility. The themes of decay and of the inadequacy of the idea of modernity in artistic fields were adopted, partly from Duchamp and Dada and partly from consciousness of the uneasiness of living in contemporary society.

It is said that Fluxus challenged notions of representation, offering instead simple presentation. This, in fact, corresponds to a major difference between Western and Japanese art. Another important Fluxus characteristic was the elimination of perceived boundaries between art and life, a very prominent trend in post war art. This was exemplified by the work and writings of Josheph Beuys who stated, &quot;every man is an artist.&quot; Fluxus&#x27;s approach was an everyday, &quot;economic&quot; one as seen in the production of small objects made of paper and plastic. Again, this strongly corresponds with some of the fundamental characteristics of Japanese culture, i.e., the high artistic value of everyday acts and objects and the aesthetic appreciation of frugality. This also links with Japanese art, and the concept of shibumi, which may involve incompleteness, and supports the appreciation of bare objects, emphasizing subtlety rather than overtness. The renowned Japanese aesthetics scholar Onishi Yoshinori called the essence of Japanese art pantonomic because of the consciousness of no distinction between nature, art and life. Art is the way to approach life and nature/reality corresponding to actual existence.

==Fluxus art==
Fluxus encouraged a &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; aesthetic, and valued simplicity over complexity. Like Dada before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an anti-art sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. As Fluxus artist Robert Filliou wrote, however, Fluxus differed from Dada in its richer set of aspirations, and the positive social and communitarian aspirations of Fluxus far outweighed the anti-art tendency that also marked the group.

Among its early associates were Joseph Beuys, Dick Higgins, Davi Det Hompson, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell, La Monte Young, Joseph Byrd, Al Hansen and Yoko Ono who explored media ranging from performance art to poetry to experimental music to film. Taking the stance of opposition to the ideas of tradition and professionalism in the arts of their time, the Fluxus group shifted the emphasis from what an artist makes to the artist&#x27;s personality, actions, and opinions. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s (their most active period) they staged &quot;action&quot; events, engaged in politics and public speaking, and produced sculptural works featuring unconventional materials. Their radically untraditional works included, for example, the video art of Nam June Paik and Charlotte Moorman and the performance art of Joseph Beuys and Wolf Vostell. During the early years of Fluxus, the often playful style of the Fluxus artists resulted in them being considered by some to be little more than a group of pranksters. Fluxus has also been compared to Dada and aspects of Pop Art and is seen as the starting point of mail art and no wave artists. Artists from succeeding generations such as Mark Bloch do not try to characterize themselves as Fluxus but create spinoffs such as Fluxpan or Jung Fluxus as a way of continuing some of the Fluxus ideas in a 21st-century, post-mail art context.

In terms of an artistic approach, Fluxus artists preferred to work with whatever materials were at hand, and either created their own work or collaborated in the creation process with their colleagues. Outsourcing part of the creative process to commercial fabricators was not usually part of Fluxus practice. Maciunas personally hand-assembled many of the Fluxus multiples and editions. While Maciunas assembled many objects by hand, he designed and intended them for mass production. Where multiple publishers produced signed, numbered objects in limited editions intended for sale at high prices, Maciunas produced open editions at low prices. Several other Fluxus publishers produced different kinds of Fluxus editions. The best known of these was the Something Else Press, established by Dick Higgins, probably the largest and most extensive Fluxus publisher, producing books in editions that ran from 1,500 copies to as many as 5,000 copies, all available at standard bookstore prices. Higgins created the term &quot;intermedia&quot; in a 1966 essay.

The art forms most closely associated with Fluxus are event scores and Fluxus boxes. Fluxus boxes (sometimes called Fluxkits or Fluxboxes) originated with George Maciunas who would gather collections of printed cards, games, and ideas, organizing them in small plastic or wooden boxes.

===Event score===
An event score, such as George Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Drip Music&quot;, is essentially a performance art script that is usually only a few lines long and consists of descriptions of actions to be performed rather than dialogue. Fluxus artists differentiate event scores from &quot;happenings&quot;. Whereas happenings were sometimes complicated, lengthy performances meant to blur the lines between performer and audience, performance and reality, event performances were usually brief and simple. The event performances sought to elevate the banal, to be mindful of the mundane, and to frustrate the high culture of academic and market-driven music and art.

The idea of the event began in Henry Cowell&#x27;s philosophy of music. Cowell, a teacher to John Cage and later to Dick Higgins, coined the term that Higgins and others later applied to short, terse descriptions of performable work. The term &quot;score&quot; is used in exactly the sense that one uses the term to describe a music score: a series of notes that allow anyone to perform the work, an idea linked both to what Nam June Paik labeled the &quot;do it yourself&quot; approach and to what Ken Friedman termed &quot;musicality.&quot; While much is made of the do it yourself approach to art, it is vital to recognize that this idea emerges in music, and such important Fluxus artists as Paik, Higgins, or Corner began as composers, bringing to art the idea that each person can create the work by &quot;doing it.&quot; This is what Friedman meant by musicality, extending the idea more radically to conclude that anyone can create work of any kind from a score, acknowledging the composer as the originator of the work while realizing the work freely and even interpreting it in far different ways from those the original composer might have done.

Other creative forms that have been adopted by Fluxus practitioners include collage, sound art, music, video, and poetry—especially visual poetry and concrete poetry.

===Use of shock===
Nam June Paik and his peers in the Fluxus art movement thoroughly understood the impact and importance of shock on the viewer. Fluxus artists believed that shock not only makes the viewer question their own reasoning, but is a means to awaken the viewer, &quot;...from a perceptive lethargy furthered by habit.&quot; Paik himself described the shock factor in his Fluxus work: &quot;People who come to my concerts or see my objects need to be transferred into another state of consciousness. They have to be high. And in order to put them into this state of highness, a little shock is required... Anyone who came to my exhibition saw the head and was high.&quot; Paik&#x27;s &quot;head&quot; was that of a real cow displayed at the entrance to his exhibition, Exposition of Music—Electronic Television, located in the Galerie Parnass, Wuppertal, Germany in 1963.

==Artistic philosophies==
Fluxus is similar in spirit to the earlier art movement of Dada, emphasizing the concept of anti-art and taking jabs at the seriousness of modern art. Fluxus artists used their minimal performances to highlight their perceived connections between everyday objects and art, similarly to Duchamp in pieces such as &quot;Fountain&quot;. Fluxus art was often presented in &quot;events&quot;, which Fluxus member George Brecht defined as &quot;the smallest unit of a situation.&quot; The events consisted of a minimal instruction, opening the events to accidents and other unintended effects. Also contributing to the randomness of events was the integration of audience members into the performances, realizing Duchamp&#x27;s notion of the viewer completing the art work.

The Fluxus artistic philosophy has been defined as a synthesis of three key factors that define the majority of Fluxus work: 
#Fluxus is intermedia. Fluxus creators like to see what happens when different media intersect. They use found and everyday objects, sounds, images, and texts to create new combinations of objects, sounds, images, and texts.
#Fluxus works are simple. The art is small, the texts are short, and the performances are brief.
#Fluxus is fun. Humor has always been an important element in Fluxus. 

==Late criticism==
There is a complexity in adequately charting a unified history of Fluxus. In &quot;Fluxus: A Brief History and Other Fictions&quot;, Owen Smith concedes that, with the emergence of new material published about Fluxus and its expansion into the present, its history must remain open. The resistance to being pigeonholed, and with the absence of a stable identity, Fluxus opened up to wide participation but also, from what would appear in history, closed off that possibility. Maciunas made frequent acts of excommunication between 1962 and 1978 which destabilized the collective. Kristine Stiles argues in one of her essays that the essence of Fluxus is &quot;performative&quot;, while recently she feels that essence has been &quot;eroded or threatened&quot;. Fluxus instead moved towards favoring the objects of publication, Stiles asserts: &quot;Care must be taken that Fluxus is not transformed historically from a radical process and presentational art into a tradition static and representational art.&quot; With no leadership, no identifiable guidelines, no real collective strategy, no homogeneity in terms of practices, Fluxus cannot be handled through traditional critical tools. Fluxus is an indicator of this confusion. Fluxus therefore is nearly always a discourse on the failure of discourse.

==Fluxus artists==
Fluxus artists shared several characteristics including wit and &quot;childlikeness&quot;, though they lacked a consistent identity as an artistic community. This vague self-identification allowed the group to include a variety of artists, including a large number of women. The possibility that Fluxus had more female members than any Western art group up to that point in history is particularly significant because Fluxus came on the heels of the white male-dominated abstract expressionism movement. However, despite the designed open-endedness of Fluxus, Maciunas insisted on maintaining unity in the collective. Because of this, Maciunas was accused of expelling certain members for deviating from what he perceived as the goals of Fluxus.

<text>The ancient universities are seven British and Irish medieval universities and early modern universities founded before the year 1600. Four of these are located in Scotland (Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and St Andrews), two in England (Oxford, and Cambridge), and one in Ireland (Dublin). The ancient universities in Great Britain and Ireland are amongst the oldest extant universities in the world. The ancient universities in Britain are part of twenty-seven culturally significant institutions recognised by the British monarchy as privileged bodies of the United Kingdom.

==Foundation and development==

The surviving ancient universities in England, Scotland and Ireland are, in order of formation:

In the middle ages, universities followed the canonical hours of the church. As the masters in the arts faculty would often also be students in one of the higher faculties, universities used these canonical hours to define periods when the compulsory lectures in the different facilities were given in order to prevent timetable clashes. At Cambridge, for example, only the canon lawyers could lecture between &quot;prime&quot; (dawn) and &quot;nones&quot; (mid afternoon). In the morning, there were lectures offered by regent masters on standard texts that they wanted to lecture. Then in the afternoon there would be advanced bachelors that would give lectures that reviews the material learned that morning. Also in the afternoon, the junior masters would discuss about other books of mathematical science or natural philosophy.

==Governance==


These universities are often governed in a quite different fashion to more recent foundations. The ancient universities of Scotland also share several distinctive features and are governed by arrangements laid down by the &quot;Universities (Scotland) Acts&quot;. In addition to these universities, some now-defunct institutions were founded during this period, including the University of Northampton (1261–1265), the university or college at Stamford, Lincolnshire (1333–1335), the university or college at Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire (1592–1605). There was also the medieval University of Dublin which was an early but largely unsuccessful attempt to establish a university in Dublin, the capital city of the Lordship of Ireland. Founded in 1320, it maintained an intermittent existence for the next two centuries, but it never flourished, and disappeared for good at the Reformation in Ireland (1534–41). It was located in St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin. It had no connection with the present University of Dublin, better known as Trinity College Dublin, which was founded in 1592.

==Undergraduate Master of Arts degree==

The ancient universities are distinctive in awarding the Magister Artium/Master of Arts (MA) as an undergraduate academic degree. This is commonly known as the Oxbridge MA, Trinity MA (Dublin), or the Scottish MA.

The ancient universities in Scotland confer the MA degree at graduation with honours and a final mark; in contrast, the ancient universities in England and Ireland award the MA purely after a period of good standing following graduation as Bachelor of Arts, usually around three years.

Because they award the MA as an undergraduate Arts degree, the ancient universities award differing titles for their postgraduate master&#x27;s degrees in the Arts and Humanities, such as the taught Master of Letters (&quot;MLitt (T)&quot;). Some confusion can arise as to whether such degrees are taught degrees or the most established (and advanced) two-year research degrees, although this is often specified.

==Acts of Parliament related to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge==
While both universities received grants of liberties and privileges by royal charter, the charters granted to Cambridge in 1231 and to Oxford in 1248 being the earliest recorded on the Privy Councils list of chartered bodies, neither university was created or incorporated by royal charter. After existing for the first few centuries of their existence as common law corporations, they were formally incorporated by the Oxford and Cambridge Act 1571, under Elizabeth I. The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge Act 1859 repealed the parts of the 1571 act that required the mayor, aldermen, citizens or municipal officer of the City of Oxford to take any oath for the conservation of the liberties and privileges of the University of Oxford.

Parliament passed the Chantries Act in 1545, which transferred ownership of all chantries and their properties to King Henry VIII. Members of the University of Cambridge sent letters to the king&#x27;s wife, Catherine Parr, about the potential threat this posed to the university. It is evident that the king already had special plans for the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and that they were given special treatment compared to the other schools of England. At Cambridge, for example, King Henry VIII founded Trinity College, which would later become an important part of the University.

In the 19th century a series of acts and commissions reduced the powers of the universities to make their own statutes. A Royal Commission in 1850 looked into both universities and proposed major reforms to their constitutions. These were enacted by the Oxford University Act 1854 and the Cambridge University Act 1856. The Universities Tests Act 1871 removed almost all religious tests from both universities (and from Durham University). The Oxford and Cambridge Universities Act 1877 set up commissioners to look into further reform of the statutes of both universities and of their constituent colleges. Further Royal Commissions into both universities were established in 1919, resulting in the Oxford and Cambridge Universities Act 1923, setting up a commission to again make statutes and regulations for the universities and their colleges. This has resulted in there being two kind of statutes at these universities – those made by the universities themselves, which may be changed by them, and the &quot;Queen-in-Council&quot; statutes made under the 1923 act or the Education Reform Act 1988 that can only be changed with permission from the Privy Council.

==Universities (Scotland) Acts==

The Universities (Scotland) Acts created a distinctive system of governance for the ancient universities in Scotland, the process beginning with the 1858 Act and ending with the 1966 Act. Despite not being founded until after the first in these series of Acts, the University of Dundee shares all the features contained therein.

As a result of these Acts, each of these universities is governed by a tripartite system of General Council, University Court, and Academic Senate.

The chief executive and chief academic is the University Principal who also holds the title of Vice-Chancellor as an honorific. The Chancellor is a titular non-resident head to each university and is elected for life by the respective General Council, although in actuality a good number of Chancellors resign before the end of their &#x27;term of office&#x27;.

Each also has a students&#x27; representative council as required by statute, although at the University of Aberdeen this has recently been renamed the &quot;Students&#x27; Association Council&quot;.

==Later universities==

Following the creation of the ancient universities, no more universities were created in Britain and Ireland until the 19th century except three defunct universities in England (Northampton, Stamford and Durham), which were quickly shut down after opening due to strong opposition-lobbying efforts by Oxford and Cambridge.

Which of the 19th-century institutions should be considered the earliest post-ancient university is a matter of debate. The main university-level foundations up to the mid 19th century were:

*Durham College (1657–1660) founded under Oliver Cromwell, for which a charter as a university was drawn up under Richard Cromwell but never sealed
*St David&#x27;s College, Lampeter by the Bishop of St David&#x27;s in 1822 (royal charter 1828) (now part of University of Wales Trinity Saint David)
*University College London as a joint stock company in 1826 under the name &quot;London University&quot; (royal charter as University College, London 1836)
*King&#x27;s College London by royal charter in 1829
*Durham University by act of parliament in 1832 (royal charter 1837)
*University of London by royal charter in 1836
*Queen&#x27;s College Belfast (now, Queen&#x27;s University Belfast), Queen&#x27;s College Cork (now University College Cork) and Queen&#x27;s College Galway (now University of Galway) by royal charters in 1845
*Bedford College, London founded by Elizabeth Jesser Reid in 1849 and the first institution of higher learning for women in the British Isles; now part of Royal Holloway, University of London
*Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland by royal charter in 1850, with the above Queen&#x27;s Colleges as constituent institutions (dissolved 1882; replaced by the Royal University of Ireland, which was in turn replaced by the National University of Ireland and Queen&#x27;s University Belfast)
*Catholic University of Ireland in 1851 (royal charter as University College Dublin 1908)
*Owens College Manchester in 1851, now the University of Manchester (via the Victoria University of Manchester)

Only Durham, London and the Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland were recognised as universities at the time of their foundation, granting their first degrees in 1837, 1839 and 1851 respectively. Durham was a collegiate university, London was an examining board, and the Queen&#x27;s University was a federal university. The other institutions, while teaching at university level, were colleges, some becoming universities later. In addition, many other universities trace their roots to institutions founded in this period, including the University of Strathclyde to the Andersonian Institute (1796), Heriot-Watt University to the School of Arts of Edinburgh (1821), Birkbeck, University of London to the London Mechanics&#x27; Institute (1823), the University of Manchester (via UMIST) to the Manchester Mechanics&#x27; Institute (1824) and (via Owen&#x27;s College) to the Manchester Royal School of Medicine (also 1824), the University of Chester to Chester Diocesan Training College (1839), Plymouth Marjon University to St John&#x27;s College, Battersea (1840) and St Mark&#x27;s College, Chelsea (1841), the University of Winchester to Winchester Diocesan Training School (1840), the University of Roehampton to Whitelands College (1841), York St John University to York Diocesan College (1841) and the York Diocesan Institution for Female Teachers (1846), and St Mary&#x27;s University, Twickenham to St Mary&#x27;s College (1850). Many medical schools also date from the 18th century or earlier, including St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital Medical School (now part of King&#x27;s College London) between 1693 and 1709, St George&#x27;s, University of London in 1733, Middlesex Hospital Medical School (now part of University College London) in 1746, London Hospital Medical College (now part of Queen Mary, University of London) in 1786.

The redbrick universities were established as university colleges in the latter half of the 19th century and mostly became universities in the early 20th century. The Royal University of Ireland (1881, as the successor of the Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland), the Victoria University (1881), and the University of Wales (1893) were the only other universities established in the 1800s, all as federal or examining universities. The first unitary university in the British Isles outside of Scotland was the University of Birmingham (1900).

<text>Microbats constitute the suborder Microchiroptera within the order Chiroptera (bats). Bats have long been differentiated into Megachiroptera (megabats) and Microchiroptera, based on their size, the use of echolocation by the Microchiroptera and other features; molecular evidence suggests a somewhat different subdivision, as the microbats have been shown to be a paraphyletic group.

==Characteristics==
Microbats are long. Most microbats feed on insects, but some of the larger species hunt birds, lizards, frogs, smaller bats or even fish. Only three species of microbat feed on the blood of large mammals or birds (&quot;vampire bats&quot;); these bats live in South and Central America.

Although most &quot;Leaf-nose&quot; microbats are fruit and nectar-eating, the name “leaf-nosed” isn&#x27;t a designation meant to indicate the preferred diet among said variety. Three species follow the bloom of columnar cacti in northwest Mexico and the Southwest United States northward in the northern spring and then the blooming agaves southward in the northern fall (autumn). Other leaf-nosed bats, such as &quot;Vampyrum spectrum&quot; of South America, hunt a variety of prey such as lizards and birds. The horseshoe bats of Europe, as well as California leaf-nosed bats, have a very intricate leaf-nose for echolocation, and feed primarily on insects.

=== Differences from megabats ===
* Microbats use echolocation, whereas megabats do not typically. (The Egyptian fruit bat &quot;Rousettus egyptiacus&quot; is an exception, but does not use the larynx echolocation method of microbats, instead giving scientists the theory that it clicks using its nasal passages and back of its tongue.)
* Microbats lack the claw at the second finger of the forelimb. This finger appears thinner and almost bonded by tissue with the third finger for extra support during flight.
* Megabats lack tails, with the exception of a few genera such as &quot;Nyctimene&quot;, whereas this trait only occurs in certain species of microbats.
* The ears of microbats possess a tragus (thought to be crucial in echolocation) and are relatively larger than megabat ears, whereas megabat ears are comparatively small and lack a tragus.
* Megabat eyes are quite large, whereas microbat eyes are comparatively smaller.

=== Dentition ===

The form and function of microbat teeth differ as a result of the various diets these bats can have. Teeth are primarily designed to break down food; therefore, the shape of the teeth correlate to specific feeding behaviors. In comparison to megabats which feed only on fruit and nectar, microbats illustrate a range of diets and have been classified as insectivores, carnivores, sanguinivores, frugivores, and nectarivores. Differences seen between the size and function of the canines and molars among microbats in these groups vary as a result of this.

The diverse diets of microbats reflect having dentition, or cheek teeth, that display a morphology derived from dilambdodont teeth, which are characterized by a W-shaped ectoloph, or stylar shelf. A W-shaped dilambdodont upper molar includes a metacone and paracone, which are located at the bottom of the “W”; while the rest of the “W” is formed by crests that run from the metacone and paracone to the cusps of the stylar self.

Microbats display differences between the size and shape of their canines and molars, in addition to having distinctive variations among their skull features that contribute to their ability to feed effectively. Frugivorous microbats have small stylar shelf areas, short molariform rows, and wide palates and faces. In addition to having wide faces, frugivorous microbats have short skulls, which place the teeth closer to the fulcrum of the jaw lever, allowing an increase in jaw strength. Frugivorous microbats also possess a different pattern on their molars compared to carnivorous, insectivorous, nectarivorous, and sanguinivorous microbats. In contrast, insectivorous microbats are characterized by having larger, but fewer teeth, long canines, and shortened third upper molars; while carnivorous microbats have large upper molars. Generally, microbats that are insectivores, carnivores, and frugivores have large teeth and small palates; however, the opposite is true for microbats that are nectarivores. Though differences exist between the palate and teeth sizes of microbats, the proportion of the sizes of these two structures are maintained among microbats of various sizes.

== Echolocation ==

Echolocation is the process where an animal produces a sound of certain wavelength, and then listens to and compares the reflected echoes to the original sound emitted. Bats use echolocation to form images of their surrounding environment and the organisms that inhabit it by eliciting ultrasonic waves via their larynx. The difference between the ultrasonic waves produced by the bat and what the bat hears provides the bat with information about its environment. Echolocation aids the bat in not only detecting prey, but also in orientation during flight.

=== Production of ultrasonic waves ===
Most microbats generate ultrasound with their larynx and emit the sound through their nose or mouth. Sound productions are generated from the vocal folds in mammals due to the elastic membranes that compose these folds. Vocalization requires these elastic membranes because they act as a source to transform airflow into acoustic pressure waves. Energy is supplied to the elastic membranes from the lungs, and results in the production of sound. The larynx houses the vocal cords and forms the passageway for the expiratory air that will produce sound. Microbat range in frequency from 14,000 to over 100,000 hertz, well beyond the range of the human ear (typical human hearing range is considered to be from 20 to 20,000 Hz). The emitted vocalizations form a broad beam of sound used to probe the environment, as well as communicate with other bats. At the molecular level, it has been found that CPLX1 is involved in this ultrasonic wave production.

=== Laryngeally echolocating microbats ===

Laryngeal echolocation is the dominant form of echolocation in microbats, however, it is not the only way in which microbats can produce ultrasonic waves. Excluding non-echolocating and laryngeally echolocating microbats, other species of microbats and megabats have been shown to produce ultrasonic waves by clapping their wings, clicking their tongues, or using their nose. Laryngeally echolocating bats, in general, produce ultrasonic waves with their larynx that is specialized to produce sounds of short wavelength. The larynx is located at the cranial end of the trachea and is surrounded by cricothyroid muscles and thyroid cartilage. For reference, in humans, this is the area where the Adam&#x27;s apple is located. Phonation of ultrasonic waves is produced through the vibrations of the vocal membranes in the expiratory air. The intensity that these vocal folds vibrate at varies with activity and between bat species. A characteristic of laryngeally echolocating microbats that distinguishes them from other echolocating microbats is the articulation of their stylohyal bone with their tympanic bone. The stylohyal bones are part of the hyoid apparatus that help support the throat and larynx. The tympanic bone forms the floor of the middle ear. In addition to the connection between the stylohyal bone and the tympanic bone as being an indicator of laryngeally echolocating microbats, another definitive marker is the presence of a flattened and expanded stylohyal bone at the cranial end.

Microbats that laryngeally echolocate must be able to distinguish between the differences of the pulse that they produce and the returning echo that follows by being able to process and understand the ultrasonic waves at a neuronal level, in order to accurately obtain information about their surrounding environment and orientation in it. The connection between the stylohyal bone and the tympanic bone enables the bat to neurally register the outgoing and incoming ultrasonic waves produced by the larynx. Furthermore, the stylohyal bones connect the larynx to the tympanic bones via a cartilaginous or fibrous connection (depending on the species of bat). Mechanically the importance of this connection is that it supports the larynx by anchoring it to the surrounding cricothyroid muscles, as well as draws it closer to the nasal cavity during phonation. The stylohyal bones are often reduced in many other mammals, however, they are more prominent in laryngeally echolocating bats and are part of the mammalian hyoid apparatus. The hyoid apparatus functions in breathing, swallowing, and phonation in microbats as well as other mammals. An important feature of the bony connection in laryngeally echolocating microbats is the extended articulation of the ventral portion of the tympanic bones and the proximal end of the stylohyal bone that bends around it to make this connection.

== Classification ==
While bats have been traditionally divided into megabats and microbats, recent molecular evidence has shown the superfamily Rhinolophoidea to be more genetically related to megabats than to microbats, indicating the microbats are paraphyletic. To resolve the paraphyly of microbats, the Chiroptera were redivided into suborders Yangochiroptera (which includes Nycteridae, vespertilionoids, noctilionoids, and emballonuroids) and Yinpterochiroptera, which includes megabats, rhinopomatids, Rhinolophidae, and Megadermatidae.

This is the classification according to Simmons and Geisler (1998):

Superfamily Emballonuroidea
* Family Emballonuridae (sac-winged bats or sheath-tailed bats)
Superfamily Rhinopomatoidea
* Family Rhinopomatidae (mouse-tailed bats)
* Family Craseonycteridae (bumblebee bat or Kitti&#x27;s hog-nosed bat)
Superfamily Rhinolophoidea
* Family Rhinolophidae (horseshoe bats)
* Family Nycteridae (hollow-faced bats or slit-faced bats)
* Family Megadermatidae (false vampires)
Superfamily Vespertilionoidea
* Family Vespertilionidae (vesper bats or evening bats)
Superfamily Molossoidea
* Family Molossidae (free-tailed bats)
* Family Antrozoidae (pallid bats)
Superfamily Nataloidea
* Family Natalidae (funnel-eared bats)
* Family Myzopodidae (sucker-footed bats)
* Family Thyropteridae (disk-winged bats)
* Family Furipteridae (smoky bats)
Superfamily Noctilionoidea
* Family Noctilionidae (bulldog bats or fisherman bats)
* Family Mystacinidae (New Zealand short-tailed bats)
* Family Mormoopidae (ghost-faced bats or moustached bats)
* Family Phyllostomidae (leaf-nosed bats)

<text>alt.religion.scientology (also known as a.r.s and ARS) was a Usenet newsgroup started in 1991 to discuss the controversial beliefs of Scientology and the activities of the Church of Scientology. The newsgroup became the focal point of an aggressive campaign known as Scientology versus the Internet, which took place online and in the courts.

== History ==
On July 17, 1991, the alt.religion.scientology newsgroup was created by Scientology-critic Scott Charles Goehring after a discussion with his then girlfriend and a third party. Goehring describes starting the newsgroup &quot;because I felt Usenet needed a place to disseminate the truth about this half-assed religion&quot; and in part as a joke.

The original Usenet &quot;newgroup message&quot; used to create the newsgroup was formatted in a manner to disguise the actual identity of the poster. A bogus email address, &quot;miscaviage@flag.sea.org&quot; (a misspelling of &quot;David Miscavige&quot;, the leader of Scientology), was inserted into the newsgroup creation message. Because of this, persons speaking in favor of Scientology frequently claim that &quot;a forgery&quot; was used to create the newsgroup. Scientology has used this argument in its requests to have the entire newsgroup removed from Usenet, but this argument has been nearly unanimously rejected by system administrators and ISPs alike.

ARS was a popular online forum in the 1990s, and at the time was the largest organized cult opposition. The Church of Scientology tried everything it could to shut down the group, but failed. In the early 2000s, ARS became available through Google Groups with their acquisition of Deja News, and as of 2024 ARS was still available online as an archive.

In the mid-2000s, a proliferation of new websites, blogs, and internet forums made ARS functionally obsolete. The persistence of ARS showed that online groups could survive attempts at deletion, accommodate anonymous participation that could not be silenced, and equip users with a platform for the release of documents. ARS &quot;provided the first proof that &#x27;leaderless resistance&#x27; organizations could have an impact on Scientology&quot;.

Additionally, attempts to disrupt ARS simply added to the anti-Scientology movement additional groups dedicated to &quot;upholding truth, transparency, freedom of information, and other lofty ideological goals&quot;.

== Disruption by Scientology ==

=== Attempts to delete the group ===

In 1995, Scientology lawyers tried to get ARS removed from the internet. Scientology lawyer Helena Kobrin attempted to remove the entire newsgroup from Usenet. On January 11, 1995, an &quot;rmgroup message&quot; (a command designed to remove a newsgroup) was posted to Usenet containing the following statement:

This message was largely ignored (and openly protested) by system administrators who carried the newsgroup. It also led to a declaration of war by hacker group Cult of the Dead Cow. Rather than being removed from Usenet, the newsgroup exploded in popularity due to the not-yet-named Streisand effect phenomenon. For a period during the first half of 1995, the newsgroup was one of the most popular and active on the entire Internet, with message traffic greater than the vast majority of newsgroups, averaging 65,000-75,000 users a month and 500-600 posts a day.

=== Cancel bots ===

Articles posted to Usenet could be canceled by a special control message (normally from the original sender). Starting in 1995, large numbers of rogue cancels were posted to ARS by a cancelbot dubbed &quot;Cancelbunny&quot;, mainly against critical articles containing portions of the &quot;Advanced Technology&quot; documents. To counteract this, a program called &quot;Lazarus&quot; was created to alert original posters of the deletion, suggesting they repost their canceled message. A group of techies nicknamed the Rabbit Hunters traced the cancel requests to a single user, who got shut down, and later to a few others that had posted pro-Scientology content, leading to a report to the FBI. 

Kobrin took to emailing users, threatening them with legal action if they didn&#x27;t remove their posts and stop posting copyrighted material. The demands went unanswered, postings of even more extensive excerpts of Church of Scientology material ensued, and more non-usenet websites were created.

According to the main Rabbit Hunter, &quot;Half of the people on a.r.s. now are there because they&#x27;re outraged about the cancel messages&quot;.

=== Flooding the newsgroup ===

In an attempt to &quot;drown out criticism of the church&quot;, pro-Scientology forces tried to effectively disable ARS by flooding it with messages until it was unusable or too expensive to read for those with slow connections. The first floods started in May 1996 and were articles containing excerpts from the public relations book &quot;What is Scientology?&quot; Later, the messages simply repeated earlier posts. One of the flooders was tracked as originating through Yale, and Yale blocked the spammer account. In a nine-day period, an estimated 20,000 messages were sent and Yale blocked access to ARS.

==Activity==
In 2006, alt.religion.scientology was one of the more popular newsgroups on Usenet, averaging three to four hundred messages per day. The total number of readers is unknown, but Google reports over 8,800 subscribers to the newsgroup through Google Groups.

Critics of Scientology claim that Scientologists are forbidden from reading or accessing the newsgroup. As evidence, they point to the software package sometimes dubbed &quot;Scieno Sitter&quot; by critics. This software package, described as an &quot;Internet filter&quot;, was part of a &quot;Web starter kit&quot; distributed by the Church. The stated purpose of the starter kit was to make it as easy as possible for Scientologists to create personal websites (hosted by the Church) promoting Scientology. The Church did not disclose the other purpose of the starter kit: the &quot;Scieno Sitter&quot; program blocks users from accessing the newsgroup &quot;alt.religion.scientology,&quot; as well as many Web sites containing information critical of Scientology, and references to the names of many vocal critics of the organization. If terms matching the software&#x27;s list of forbidden words appear, the software may blank them from a web page, kick the user from the chatroom where the words appeared, or even shut down their browser altogether.

<text>alt.binaries.slack is a Usenet newsgroup created for the purpose of posting pictures, sounds, and utilities related to the Church of the SubGenius, making them available for everyone to see and hear. Because the Church of the SubGenius is well known for encouraging sick and twisted humor, the newsgroup is also home to artists who post humorous artwork of all sorts (including some pieces that may be considered distasteful). A fair amount of the pictures on &quot;alt.binaries.slack&quot; are adult-oriented, and may be considered offensive by some viewers. The of the newsgroup state that they enjoy deliberately offending those who are too easily offended.

In spite of the crude nature of some of the pictures and sounds posted to the newsgroup, many of its regular contributors have displayed considerable talent. Computer graphics artists often visit &quot;alt.binaries.slack&quot; to show off their latest experimental works, along with underground musicians who want to expose their music to a &quot;unique&quot; audience.

The clip art image of J.R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs, the founder of the Church of the SubGenius, is commonly seen on &quot;alt.binaries.slack,&quot; where he appears regularly in images by many artists. Proper etiquette on the newsgroup dictates that credit be given where it is due, and acknowledgment of the ownership of &quot;Bob&#x27;s&quot; image by the Church is accepted by the regular newsgroup participants.

Shortly after its creation, in 1995, the newsgroup was targeted by warez traders, who tried to use it for the distribution of pirated commercial software. The users of the newsgroup responded by forming their own internal &quot;police force&quot; for the newsgroup, known as the &quot;SubGenius Police, Usenet Tactical Unit - Mobile&quot; (SPUTUM). This group of Internet-savvy people embarked on a successful campaign to drive the &quot;warez&quot; traders out of the newsgroup. They then turned their resources and skills towards the ongoing problem of spam on the Internet. As a result, the users of &quot;alt.binaries.slack&quot; pride themselves on having one of the most spam-free binaries newsgroups on Usenet.

A protracted 1997 flame war erupted between newsgroup users and Mike Enlow, the self-proclaimed &quot;world&#x27;s most-respected information broker/technology marketing consultant&quot;, who spammed the newsgroups with an advertisement that included a picture of himself. ABS regulars began digitally manipulating the photo in various means and setting up webpages of their &quot;Enlow Art&quot;. Before long dozens of mirror websites were set up on servers around the world. The length and hostility of the flame war led some ABS regulars to question how far &quot;parodying&quot; should go.

<doc id="86344" wikidata="Q1143413" url="?curid=86344" title="Medieval university">
<text>A medieval university was a corporation organized during the Middle Ages for the purposes of higher education. The first Western European institutions generally considered to be universities were established in present-day Italy, including the Kingdoms of Sicily and Naples, and the Kingdoms of England, France, Spain, Portugal, and Scotland between the 11th and 15th centuries for the study of the arts and the higher disciplines of theology, law, and medicine. These universities evolved from much older Christian cathedral schools and monastic schools, and it is difficult to define the exact date when they became true universities, though the lists of studia generalia for higher education in Europe held by the Vatican are a useful guide.

The word originally applied only to the scholastic guilds—that is, the corporation of students and masters—within the , and it was always modified, as , , or . Eventually, probably in the late 14th century, the term began to appear by itself to exclusively mean a self-regulating community of teachers and scholars recognized and sanctioned by civil or ecclesiastical authority.

From the Early Modern period onward, this Western-style organizational form gradually spread from the medieval Latin West across the globe, eventually replacing all other higher-learning institutions and becoming the pre-eminent model for higher education everywhere.

== Antecedents ==


The university is generally regarded as a formal institution that has its origin in the Medieval Christian setting in Europe. For hundreds of years prior to the establishment of universities, European higher education took place in Christian cathedral schools and monastic schools (&quot;scholae monasticae&quot;), where monks and nuns taught classes. Evidence of these immediate forerunners of the university at many places dates back to the 6th century AD.

With the increasing growth and urbanization of European society during the 12th and 13th centuries, a demand grew for professional clergy within the Catholic Church. Following the Gregorian Reform&#x27;s emphasis on canon law and the study of the sacraments, the Catholic bishops formed cathedral schools to train their clergy in canon law, and also in the more secular aspects of religious administration, including logic and disputation for use in preaching and theological discussion, and accounting to control the Church&#x27;s finances more effectively. Pope Gregory VII was critical in promoting and regulating the concept of modern university, as his 1079 Papal decree ordered the regulated establishment of cathedral schools that transformed themselves into the first European universities. Learning became essential to advancing in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and teachers also gained prestige. Demand quickly outstripped the capacity of cathedral schools, each of which was essentially run by one schoolmaster. In addition, tensions rose between the students of cathedral schools and burghers in smaller towns. As a result, cathedral schools migrated to large cities, like Bologna, Rome, and Paris.

S. F. Alatas has noted some parallels between madrasahs and early European colleges and has inferred that the first universities in Europe were influenced by the madrasahs in Islamic Spain and the Emirate of Sicily. George Makdisi, Toby Huff and Norman Daniel, however, have questioned this, citing the lack of evidence for an actual transmission from the Islamic world to Christian Europe and highlighting the differences in the structure, methodologies, procedures, curricula and legal status of the &quot;Islamic college&quot; (&quot;madrasa&quot;) versus the European university.

== Establishment ==
Hastings Rashdall set out the modern understanding of the medieval origins of European universities, noting that the earliest universities emerged spontaneously as &quot;a scholastic Guild, whether of Masters or Students... without any express authorization of King, Pope, Prince or Prelate&quot;.

Among the earliest universities of this type were the University of Bologna (1088), University of Paris (c. 1150), University of Oxford (1167), University of Modena (1175), University of Palencia (1208), University of Cambridge (1209), University of Salamanca (1218), University of Montpellier (1220), University of Padua (1222), University of Naples (1224), University of Toulouse (1229), University of Orleans (1235), University of Siena (1240), University of Valladolid (1241) University of Northampton (1261), University of Coimbra (1288), University of Macerata (1290), University of Pisa (1343), Charles University in Prague (1348), Jagiellonian University (1364), University of Vienna (1365), Heidelberg University, (1386) and the University of St Andrews (1413) begun as private corporations of teachers and their pupils.
In many cases universities petitioned secular power for privileges and this became a model. The Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I in &quot;Authentica Habita&quot; (1158) gave the first privileges to students in Bologna. Another step was Pope Alexander III in 1179 &quot;forbidding masters of the church schools to take fees for granting the license to teach (&quot;licentia docendi&quot;), and obliging them to give license to properly qualified teachers&quot;. Rashdall considered that the integrity of a university was only preserved in such an internally regulated corporation, which protected the scholars from external intervention. This independently evolving organization was absent in the universities of southern Italy and Spain, which served the bureaucratic needs of monarchs—and were, according to Rashdall, their artificial creations.

The University of Paris was formally recognized when Pope Gregory IX issued the bull &quot;Parens scientiarum&quot; (1231). This was a revolutionary step: &quot;studium generale&quot; (university) and &quot;universitas&quot; (corporation of students or teachers) existed even before, but after the issuing of the bull, they attained autonomy. &quot;[T]he papal bull of 1233, which stipulated that anyone admitted as a teacher in Toulouse had the right to teach everywhere without further examinations (&quot;ius ubique docendi&quot;), in time, transformed this privilege into the single most important defining characteristic of the university and made it the symbol of its institutional autonomy ... By the year 1292, even the two oldest universities, Bologna and Paris, felt the need to seek similar bulls from Pope Nicholas IV&quot;.

By the 13th century, almost half of the highest offices in the Church were occupied by degree masters (abbots, archbishops, cardinals), and over one-third of the second-highest offices were occupied by masters. In addition, some of the greatest theologians of the High Middle Ages, Thomas Aquinas and Robert Grosseteste, were products of the medieval university.

The development of the medieval university coincided with the widespread reintroduction of Aristotle from Byzantine and Arab scholars. In fact, the European university put Aristotelian and other natural science texts at the center of its curriculum, with the result that the &quot;medieval university laid far greater emphasis on science than does its modern counterpart and descendent&quot;.

Although it has been assumed that the universities went into decline during the Renaissance due to the scholastic and Aristotelian emphasis of its curriculum being less popular than the cultural studies of Renaissance humanism, Toby Huff has noted the continued importance of the European universities, with their focus on Aristotle and other scientific and philosophical texts into the early modern period, arguing that they played a crucial role in the Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries. As he puts it &quot;Copernicus, Galileo, Tycho Brahe, Kepler, and Newton were all extraordinary products of the apparently Procrustean and allegedly Scholastic universities of Europe... Sociological and historical accounts of the role of the university as an institutional locus for science and as an incubator of scientific thought and arguments have been vastly understated&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
Initially medieval universities did not have physical facilities such as the campus of a modern university. Classes were taught wherever space was available, such as churches and homes. A university was not a physical space but a collection of individuals banded together as a &quot;universitas&quot;. Soon, however, universities began to rent, buy or construct buildings specifically for the purposes of teaching.

Universities were generally structured along three types, depending on who paid the teachers. The first type was in Bologna, where students hired and paid for the teachers. The second type was in Paris, where teachers were paid by the church. Oxford and Cambridge were predominantly supported by the crown and the state, which helped them survive the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538 and the subsequent removal of all principal Catholic institutions in England. These structural differences created other characteristics. At the Bologna university the students ran everything—a fact that often put teachers under great pressure and disadvantage. In Paris, teachers ran the school; thus Paris became the premiere spot for teachers from all over Europe. Also, in Paris the main subject matter was theology, so control of the qualifications awarded was in the hands of an external authority – the chancellor of the diocese. In Bologna, where students chose more secular studies, the main subject was law.

It was also characteristic of teachers and scholars to move around. Universities often competed to secure the best and most popular teachers, leading to the marketisation of teaching. Universities published their list of scholars to entice students to study at their institution. Students of Peter Abelard followed him to Melun, Corbeil, and Paris, showing that popular teachers brought students with them.

== Students ==
Students attended the medieval university at different ages—from 14 if they were attending Oxford or Paris to study the arts, to their 30s if they were studying law in Bologna. During this period of study, students often lived far from home and unsupervised, and as such developed a reputation, both among contemporary commentators and modern historians, for drunken debauchery. Students are frequently criticized in the Middle Ages for neglecting their studies for drinking, gambling and sleeping with prostitutes. In Bologna, some of their laws permitted students to be citizens of the city if they were enrolled at a university.

=== Course of study ===
University studies took six years for a Master of Arts degree (a Bachelor of Arts degree was awarded after completing the third or fourth year). Studies for this were organized by the faculty of arts, where the seven liberal arts were taught: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music theory, grammar, logic, and rhetoric. All instruction was given in Latin and students were expected to converse in that language. The &quot;trivium&quot; comprised the three subjects that were taught first: grammar, logic, and rhetoric. The &quot;quadrivium&quot; consisted of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. The quadrivium was taught after the preparatory work of the trivium and would lead to the degree of Master of Arts. The curriculum came also to include the three Aristotelian philosophies: physics, metaphysics and moral philosophy.

Much of medieval thought in philosophy and theology can be found in scholastic textual commentary because scholasticism was such a popular method of teaching. Aelius Donatus&#x27; &quot;Ars grammatica&quot; was the standard textbook for grammar; also studied were the works of Priscian and &quot;Graecismus&quot; by Eberhard of Béthune. Cicero&#x27;s works were used for the study of rhetoric. Studied books on logic included Porphyry&#x27;s introduction to Aristotelian logic, Gilbert de la Porrée&#x27;s &quot;De sex principiis&quot; and &quot;Summulae Logicales&quot; by Petrus Hispanus (later Pope John XXI). The standard work of astronomy was &quot;Tractatus de sphaera&quot;.

Once a Master of Arts degree had been conferred, the student could leave the university or pursue further studies in one of the higher faculties, law, medicine, or theology, the last one being the most prestigious. Originally, only few universities had a faculty of theology, because the popes wanted to control the theological studies. Until the mid-14th century, theology could be studied only at universities in Paris, Oxford, Cambridge and Rome. First the establishment of the University of Prague (1347) ended their monopoly and afterwards also other universities got the right to establish theological faculties.

A popular textbook for theological study was called the &quot;Sentences&quot; (&quot;Quattuor libri sententiarum&quot;) of Peter Lombard; theology students as well as masters were required to lecture or to write extensive commentaries on this text as part of their curriculum. Studies in the higher faculties could take up to twelve years for a master&#x27;s degree or doctorate (initially the two were synonymous), though again a bachelor&#x27;s and a licentiate&#x27;s degree could be awarded along the way.

Courses were offered according to books, not by subject or theme. For example, a course might be on a book by Aristotle, or a book from the Bible. Courses were not elective: the course offerings were set, and everyone had to take the same courses. There were, however, occasional choices as to which teacher to use.

Students often entered the university at fourteen to fifteen years of age, though many were older. Classes usually started at 5:00 or 6:00 a.m.

=== Legal status ===
As students had the legal status of clerics, Canon Law prohibited women from being admitted into universities. Students were afforded the legal protection of the clergy, as well. In this way, no one was allowed to physically harm them; they could only be tried for crimes in an ecclesiastical court, and were thus immune from any corporal punishment. This gave students free rein in urban environments to break secular laws with impunity, which led to many abuses: theft, rape, and murder. Students did not face serious consequences from the law. Students were also known to engage in drunkenness. Sometimes citizens were forbidden to interact with students because they made accusations against the university.

This led to uneasy tensions with secular authorities—the demarcation between town and gown. Masters and students would sometimes &quot;strike&quot; by leaving a city and not returning for years. This happened at the University of Paris strike of 1229 after a riot left a number of students dead. The university went on strike and they did not return for two years.

Most universities in Europe were recognized by the Holy See as , testified by a papal bull. Members of these institutions were encouraged to disseminate their knowledge across Europe, often lecturing at a different . Indeed, one of the privileges the papal bull confirmed was the right to confer the , an entitlement to teach everywhere.

<text>James Naismith (; November 6, 1861November 28, 1939) was a Canadian-American physical educator, physician, Christian chaplain, and sports coach, best known as the inventor of the game of basketball.

After moving to the United States, he wrote the original basketball rule book and founded the University of Kansas basketball program in 1898. Naismith lived to see basketball adopted as an Olympic demonstration sport in 1904 and as an official event at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, as well as the birth of the National Invitation Tournament (1938) and the NCAA Tournament (1939).

Naismith studied and taught physical education at McGill University in Montreal until 1890, before moving to Springfield, Massachusetts, United States, later that year, where in 1891 he designed the game of basketball while he was teaching at the International YMCA Training School. Seven years after inventing basketball, Naismith received his medical degree in Denver in 1898. He then arrived at the University of Kansas, later becoming the Kansas Jayhawks&#x27; athletic director and coach.

While a coach at Kansas, Naismith coached Phog Allen, who later became the coach at Kansas for 39 seasons, beginning a lengthy and prestigious coaching tree. Allen then went on to coach legends including Adolph Rupp and Dean Smith, among others, who themselves coached many notable players and future coaches.

==Early years==

Naismith was born on November 6, 1861, in Almonte, Canada West, Province of Canada (now part of Mississippi Mills, Ontario, Canada) to Scottish parents. Despite some sources to the contrary Naismith never had a middle name and never signed his name with an &quot;A&quot; initial. The &quot;A&quot; was added by someone in administration at the University of Kansas. Gifted in farm labour, Naismith spent his days outside playing catch, hide-and-seek, or duck on a rock, a medieval game in which a person guards a large skipping stone from opposing players, who try to knock it down by throwing smaller stones at it. To play duck on a rock most effectively, Naismith soon found that a soft lobbing shot was far more effective than a straight hard throw, a thought that later proved essential for the invention of basketball. Orphaned early in his life, Naismith lived with his aunt and uncle for many years and attended grade school at Bennies Corners near Almonte. Then, he enrolled in Almonte High School, in Almonte, Ontario, from which he graduated in 1883.

In the same year, Naismith entered McGill University in Montreal. Although described as a slight figure, standing and listed at he was a talented and versatile athlete, representing McGill in football, lacrosse, rugby, soccer, and gymnastics. He played centre on the football team, and made himself some padding to protect his ears. It was for personal use, not team use. He won multiple Wicksteed medals for outstanding gymnastics performances. Naismith earned a BA in physical education (1888) and a diploma at the Presbyterian College in Montreal (1890). At the end of his career, in 1938 and 1939, he would receive honorary doctorates from both institutions. From 1888 to 1890, Naismith taught physical education and became the first McGill director of athletics, but then left Montreal to study at the YMCA International Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. Naismith played football during his one year as a student at Springfield, where he was coached by Amos Alonzo Stagg and scored a touchdown in the first exhibition of indoor college football at Madison Square Garden.

==Springfield College: Invention of basketball==
Naismith is credited with inventing basketball. Having been an outstanding football player at McGill University in Montreal, he later decided to become a physical education teacher at McGill University for his three postgraduate years and then went to Springfield, Massachusetts, to study at the YMCA International Training School in the 1890s. Whilst teaching there, Naismith realized he needed to invent an indoor game for the winter due to the weather conditions.

After completing the YMCA physical director training program that had brought him to Springfield, Naismith was hired as a full-time faculty member in 1891. At the Springfield YMCA, Naismith struggled with a rowdy class that was confined to indoor games throughout the harsh New England winter, and thus was perpetually short-tempered. Under orders from Luther Gulick, head of physical education there, Naismith was given 14 days to create an indoor game that would provide an &quot;athletic distraction&quot;; Gulick demanded that it would not take up much room, could help its track athletes to keep in shape and explicitly emphasized to &quot;make it fair for all players and not too rough&quot;. Naismith was later employed to teach physical education using two boxes. He told the superintendent he needed the two boxes to be put onto a pole so a large ball could be thrown into them.

In his attempt to think up a new game, Naismith was guided by three main thoughts. Firstly, he analyzed the most popular games of the times (rugby, lacrosse, soccer, football, hockey, and baseball); Naismith noticed the hazards of a ball and concluded that the big, soft soccer ball was safest. Secondly, he saw that most physical contact occurred while running with the ball, dribbling, or hitting it, so he decided that passing was the only legal option. Finally, Naismith further reduced body contact by making the goal unguardable by placing it high above the player&#x27;s heads with the plane of the goal&#x27;s opening parallel to the floor. This placement forced the players to score goals by throwing a soft, lobbing shot like that which had proven effective in his old favorite game, duck on a rock. For this purpose, Naismith asked a janitor to find a pair of boxes, but the janitor brought him peach baskets instead. Naismith christened this new game &quot;Basket Ball&quot; and put his thoughts together in 13 basic rules.

The first game of &quot;Basket Ball&quot; was played in December 1891. In a handwritten report, Naismith described the circumstances of the inaugural match; in contrast to modern basketball, the players played nine versus nine, handled a soccer ball, not a basketball, and instead of shooting at two hoops, the goals were a pair of peach baskets: &quot;When Mr. Stubbins brot up the peach baskets to the gym I secured them on the inside of the railing of the gallery. This was about from the floor, one at each end of the gymnasium. I then put the 13 rules on the bulletin board just behind the instructor&#x27;s platform, secured a soccer ball, and awaited the arrival of the class ... The class did not show much enthusiasm, but followed my lead ... I then explained what they had to do to make goals, tossed the ball up between the two center men and tried to keep them somewhat near the rules. Most of the fouls were called for running with the ball, though tackling the man with the ball was not uncommon.&quot; In contrast to modern basketball, the original rules did not include what is known today as the dribble. Since the ball could only be moved up the court by a pass early players tossed the ball over their heads as they ran up court. Also following each &quot;goal&quot;, a jump ball was taken in the middle of the court. Both practices are obsolete in the rules of modern basketball.

In a radio interview in January 1939, Naismith gave more details of the first game and the initial rules that were used:

I showed them two peach baskets I&#x27;d nailed up at each end of the gym, and I told them the idea was to throw the ball into the opposing team&#x27;s peach basket. I blew a whistle, and the first game of basketball began ... The boys began tackling, kicking, and punching in the clinches. They ended up in a free-for-all in the middle of the gym floor. [The injury toll: several black eyes, one separated shoulder, and one player knocked unconscious.] It certainly was murder. [Naismith changed some of the rules as part of his quest to develop a clean sport.] The most important one was that there should be no running with the ball. That stopped tackling and slugging. We tried out the game with those [new] rules (fouls), and we didn&#x27;t have one casualty.

Naismith was a classmate of Amos Alonzo Stagg at the YMCA School, where Stagg coached the football team. They became close friends and Naismith played on the football team and Stagg played on the basketball team. Naismith invited Stagg to play in the first public basketball game on March 12, 1892. The students defeated the faculty 5–1 and Stagg scored the only basket for the faculty. The Springfield Republican reported on the same: &quot;Over 200 spectators crammed their necks over the gallery railing of the Christian Workers gymnasium while they watched the game of &#x27;basket ball&#x27; between the teachers and the students. The most conspicuous figure on the floor was Stagg in the blue Yale uniform who managed to have a hand in every scrimmage.&quot;

By 1892, basketball had grown so popular on campus that Dennis Horkenbach (editor-in-chief of &quot;The Triangle&quot;, the Springfield college newspaper) featured it in an article called &quot;A New Game&quot;, and there were calls to call this new game &quot;Naismith Ball&quot;, but Naismith refused. By 1893, basketball was introduced internationally by the YMCA movement. From Springfield, Naismith went to Denver, where he acquired a medical degree, and in 1898, he joined the University of Kansas faculty at Lawrence.

The family of Lambert G. Will, disputing Naismith&#x27;s sole creation of the game, has claimed that Naismith borrowed components for the game of basketball from Will, citing alleged photos and letters. In an interview, the family did give Naismith credit for the general idea of the sport, but they claimed Will changed aspects of Naismith&#x27;s original plans for the game and Naismith took credit for the changes.

Spalding worked with Naismith to develop the official basketball and the Spalding Athletic Library official basketball rule book for 1893–1894.

==University of Kansas==

The University of Kansas men&#x27;s basketball program officially began following Naismith&#x27;s arrival in 1898, seven years after Naismith drafted the sport&#x27;s first official rules. Naismith was not initially hired to coach basketball, but rather as a chapel director and physical-education instructor. In those early days, the majority of the basketball games were played against nearby YMCA teams, with YMCAs across the nation having played an integral part in the birth of basketball. Other common opponents were Haskell Indian Nations University and William Jewell College. Under Naismith, the team played only one current Big 12 school: Kansas State (once). Naismith is, ironically, the only coach in the program&#x27;s history to have a losing record (55–60). However, Naismith coached Forrest &quot;Phog&quot; Allen, his eventual successor at Kansas, who went on to join his mentor in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

When Allen became a coach himself and told him that he was going to coach basketball at Baker University in 1904, Naismith discouraged him: &quot;You can&#x27;t coach basketball; you just play it.&quot; Instead, Allen embarked on a coaching career that would lead him to be known as &quot;the Father of Basketball Coaching&quot;. During his time at Kansas, Allen coached Dean Smith (1952 National Championship team) and Adolph Rupp (1922 Helms Foundation National Championship team). Smith and Rupp have joined Naismith and Allen as members of the Basketball Hall of Fame.

By the turn of the century, enough college teams were in the East that the first intercollegiate competitions could be played out. Although the sport continued to grow, Naismith long regarded the game as a curiosity and preferred gymnastics and wrestling as better forms of physical activity. However, basketball became a demonstration sport at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis. As the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame reports, Naismith was not interested in self-promotion nor was he interested in the glory of competitive sports. Instead, he was more interested in his physical-education career; he received an honorary PE master&#x27;s degree in 1910, patrolled the Mexican border for four months in 1916, traveled to France, and published two books (&quot;A Modern College&quot; in 1911 and &quot;Essence of a Healthy Life&quot; in 1918). He took American citizenship on May 4, 1925. In 1909, Naismith&#x27;s duties at Kansas were redefined as a professorship; he served as the &quot;de facto&quot; athletic director at Kansas for much of the early 20th century.

Naismith had &quot;strong feelings against segregation,&quot; dating back to his World War I-era service in France and his service on the United States-Mexico border, and he strove for progress in race relations through modest steps. During the 1930s, he would not or could not get African-Americans onto Kansas&#x27; varsity Jayhawks, but he did help engineer the admission of black students to the university&#x27;s swimming pool. Until then, they had been given automatic passing grades on a required swimming test without entering the pool, so it could remain all-white.

Through Naismith&#x27;s association with Baker University Basketball Coach Emil Liston, he became familiar and impressed with Emil Liston&#x27;s fraternity at Baker University, Sigma Phi Epsilon (SigEp). As a result, he started the effort to bring a Sigma Phi Epsilon chapter to his University of Kansas (KU). On February 18, 1923, Naismith, intending to bring a SigEp Chapter to KU, was initiated as a SigEp member by national office of the fraternity. Under Naismith&#x27;s leadership, the University of Kansas Sigma Phi Epsilon chapter was founded and officially Charted on April 28, 1923, with Naismith leading the new 40-member fraternity as &quot;Chapter Counselor.&quot; Naismith was deeply involved with the members, serving as Chapter Counselor for 16 years, from 1923 until his death in 1939. During those 16 years as Chapter Counselor, he married SigEp&#x27;s housemother, Mrs. Florence Kincaid. Members who were interviewed during that era remembered Naismith: &quot;He was deeply religious&quot;, &quot;He listened more than he spoke&quot;, &quot;He thought sports were nothing but an avenue to keep young people involved so they could do their studies and relate to their community&quot;, and &quot;It was really nice having someone with the caliber of Dr. Naismith, he helped many a SigEp.&quot;

In 1935, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (founded by Naismith&#x27;s pupil Phog Allen) collected money so the 74-year-old Naismith could witness the introduction of basketball into the official Olympic sports program of the 1936 Summer Olympic Games in Berlin. There, Naismith handed out the medals to three North American teams: the United States, for the gold medal, Canada, for the silver medal, and Mexico, for their bronze medal. During the Olympics, he was named the honorary president of the International Basketball Federation. When Naismith returned, he commented that seeing the game played by many nations was the greatest compensation he could have received for his invention. In 1937, Naismith played a role in the formation of the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball, which later became the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA).

Naismith became professor &quot;emeritus&quot; at Kansas when he retired in 1937 at the age of 76. In addition to his years as a coach, for a total of almost 40 years, Naismith worked at the school and during those years, he also served as its athletic director and was also a faculty member at the school. In 1939, Naismith suffered a fatal brain hemorrhage. He was interred at Memorial Park Cemetery in Lawrence, Kansas. His masterwork &quot;Basketball — its Origins and Development&quot; was published posthumously in 1941. In Lawrence, Naismith has a road named in his honor, Naismith Drive, which runs in front of Allen Fieldhouse and James Naismith Court therein are named in his honor, despite Naismith&#x27;s having the worst record in school history. Naismith Valley Park, located at the south end of Naismith Drive in Lawrence is also named in his honor. Naismith Hall, a dormitory, is located on the northeast corner of the intersection of 19th Street with Naismith Drive on the KU campus is also named for him.

==Head-coaching record==
===Basketball===
In 1898, Naismith became the first basketball coach of University of Kansas. He compiled a record of 55–60 and is ironically the only losing coach in Kansas history. Naismith is at the beginning of a massive and prestigious coaching tree, as he coached Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame coach Phog Allen, who himself coached Hall of Fame coaches Dean Smith, Adolph Rupp, and Ralph Miller who all coached future coaches as well.

In addition to Allen, Naismith also can be seen as a mentor and therefore beginning for the coaching tree branches of John McLendon who wasn&#x27;t permitted to play at Kansas but was close to Naismith during his time as an athletic director. Amos Alonzo Stagg, was primarily a football coach, but he did play basketball for Naismith in Springfield, coached a year of basketball at Chicago and had several football players who also coached basketball such as Jesse Harper, Fred Walker and Tony Hinkle.




==Legacy==
Naismith invented the game of basketball and wrote the original 13 rules of this sport; for comparison, the NBA rule book today features 66 pages. The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, is named in his honor, and he was an inaugural inductee in 1959. The National Collegiate Athletic Association rewards its best players and coaches annually with the Naismith Awards, among them the Naismith College Player of the Year, the Naismith College Coach of the Year, and the Naismith Prep Player of the Year. After the Olympic introduction to men&#x27;s basketball in 1936, women&#x27;s basketball became an Olympic event in Montreal during the 1976 Summer Olympics.

Naismith was also inducted into the Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame, the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame, the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame, the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame, the McGill University Sports Hall of Fame, the Kansas State Sports Hall of Fame, FIBA Hall of Fame. The FIBA Basketball World Cup trophy is named the &quot;James Naismith Trophy&quot; in his honor. On June 21, 2013, Naismith was inducted into the Kansas Hall of Fame during ceremonies in Topeka.

Naismith&#x27;s home town of Almonte, Ontario, hosts an annual 3-on-3 tournament for all ages and skill levels in his honor. Every year, this event attracts hundreds of participants and involves over 20 half-court games along the main street of the town. All proceeds of the event go to youth basketball programs in the area.

Today basketball is played by more than 300 million people worldwide, making it one of the most popular team sports. In North America, basketball has produced some of the most-admired athletes of the 20th century. ESPN and the Associated Press both conducted polls to name the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century. Basketball player Michael Jordan came in first in the ESPN poll and second (behind Babe Ruth) in the AP poll. Both polls featured fellow basketball players Wilt Chamberlain (of KU, like Naismith) and Bill Russell in the top 20.
The original rules of basketball written by James Naismith in 1891, considered to be basketball&#x27;s founding document, was auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s, New York, in December 2010. Josh Swade, a University of Kansas alumnus and basketball enthusiast, went on a crusade in 2010 to persuade moneyed alumni to consider bidding on and hopefully winning the document at auction to give it to the University of Kansas. Swade eventually persuaded David G. Booth, a billionaire investment banker and KU alumnus, and his wife Suzanne Booth, to commit to bidding at the auction. The Booths won the bidding and purchased the document for a record US$4,338,500, the most ever paid for a sports memorabilia item, and gave the document to the University of Kansas. Swade&#x27;s project and eventual success are chronicled in a 2012 ESPN &quot;30 for 30&quot; documentary &quot;There&#x27;s No Place Like Home&quot; and in a corresponding book, &quot;The Holy Grail of Hoops: One Fan&#x27;s Quest to Buy the Original Rules of Basketball&quot;. The University of Kansas constructed an $18 million building named the Debruce Center, which houses the rules and opened in March 2016.

Naismith was designated a National Historic Person in 1976, on the advice of the national Historic Sites and Monuments Board

In 1991, postage stamps commemorated the centennial of basketball&#x27;s invention: four stamps were issued by Canada Post, including one with Naismith&#x27;s name; one stamp was issued by the US Postal Service. Another Canadian stamp, in 2009, honored the game&#x27;s invention.

In July 2019, Naismith was inducted into Toronto&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

On January 15, 2021, Google placed a Google Doodle celebrating James Naismith on its home page in 18 countries, on five continents.

==Personal life==
Naismith was the second child of two Scottish immigrants. His father left Europe when he was 18, and also settled down in Lanark County.

On June 20, 1894, Naismith married Maude Sherman in Springfield, Massachusetts. The couple had five children.

He was a member of the Pi Gamma Mu and Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternities. Naismith was a Presbyterian minister and was also a Freemason.

His first wife died in 1937, and on June 11, 1939, he married Florence Kincaid. On November 19 of that year, Naismith suffered a major brain hemorrhage and died nine days later in his home in Lawrence. He was 78 years old. Naismith died eight months after the birth of the NCAA Basketball Championship, which today has evolved to one of the biggest sports events in North America. Naismith is buried with his first wife in Memorial Park Cemetery in Lawrence. Florence Kincaid died in 1977 at the age of 98 and is buried with her first husband, Frank B. Kincaid, in Elmwood Cemetery in Beloit, Kansas.

During his lifetime, Naismith held these educational and academic positions:

<text>In chemistry, a group (also known as a family) is a column of elements in the periodic table of the chemical elements. There are 18 numbered groups in the periodic table; the 14 f-block columns, between groups 2 and 3, are not numbered. The elements in a group have similar physical or chemical characteristics of the outermost electron shells of their atoms (i.e., the same core charge), because most chemical properties are dominated by the orbital location of the outermost electron.

The modern numbering system of &quot;group 1&quot; to &quot;group 18&quot; has been recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) since 1988. The 1-18 system is based on each atom&#x27;s s, p and d electrons beyond those in atoms of the preceding noble gas. Two older incompatible naming schemes can assign the same number to different groups depending on the system being used. The older schemes were used by the Chemical Abstract Service (CAS, more popular in the United States), and by IUPAC before 1988 (more popular in Europe). The system of eighteen groups is generally accepted by the chemistry community, but some dissent exists about membership of elements number 1 and 2 (hydrogen and helium). Similar variation on the inner transition metals continues to exist in textbooks, although the correct positioning has been known since 1948 and was twice endorsed by IUPAC in 1988 (together with the 1–18 numbering) and 2021.

Groups may also be identified using their topmost element, or have a specific name. For example, group 16 is also described as the &quot;oxygen group&quot; and as the &quot;chalcogens&quot;. An exception is the &quot;iron group&quot;, which usually refers to group 8, but in chemistry may also mean iron, cobalt, and nickel, or some other set of elements with similar chemical properties. In astrophysics and nuclear physics, it usually refers to iron, cobalt, nickel, chromium, and manganese.

==Group names==
Modern group names are numbers 1–18, with the 14 f-block columns remaining unnumbered (together making the &quot;32 columns&quot; in the periodic table). Also, trivial names (like &quot;halogens&quot;) are common. In history, several sets of group names have been used, based on Roman numberings I–VIII, and &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; suffixes.
===List of group names===
: &quot;Coinage metals&quot;: authors differ on whether roentgenium (Rg) is considered a coinage metal. It is in group 11, like the other coinage metals, and is expected to be chemically similar to gold. On the other hand, being extremely radioactive and short-lived, it cannot actually be used for coinage as the name suggests, and on that basis it is sometimes excluded.

: &quot;triels&quot; (group 13), from Greek &quot;tri&quot;: three, III
: &quot;tetrels&quot; (group 14), from Greek &quot;tetra&quot;: four, IV
: &quot;pentel&quot; (group 15), from Greek &quot;penta&quot;: five, V

==CAS and old IUPAC numbering (A/B)==
Two earlier group number systems exist: &quot;CAS&quot; (Chemical Abstracts Service) and &quot;old IUPAC&quot;. Both use numerals (Arabic or Roman) and letters &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. Both systems agree on the numbers. The numbers indicate approximately the highest oxidation number of the elements in that group, and so indicate similar chemistry with other elements with the same numeral. The number proceeds in a linearly increasing fashion for the most part, once on the left of the table, and once on the right (see List of oxidation states of the elements), with some irregularities in the transition metals. However, the two systems use the letters differently. For example, potassium (K) has one valence electron. Therefore, it is located in group 1. Calcium (Ca) is in group 2, for it contains two valence electrons.

In the old IUPAC system the letters A and B were designated to the left (A) and right (B) part of the table, while in the CAS system the letters A and B are designated to main group elements (A) and transition elements (B). The old IUPAC system was frequently used in Europe, while the CAS is most common in America. The new IUPAC scheme was developed to replace both systems as they confusingly used the same names to mean different things. The new system simply numbers the groups increasingly from left to right on the standard periodic table. The IUPAC proposal was first circulated in 1985 for public comments, and was later included as part of the 1990 edition of the &quot;Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry&quot;.

==Non-columnwise groups==
While &quot;groups&quot; are defined to be &quot;columns&quot; in the periodic table, as described above, there are also sets of elements named &quot;group&quot; that are &quot;not&quot; a column:


Similar sets: noble metals, coinage metals, precious metals, refractory metals.

<text>Alger Hiss (November 11, 1904 – November 15, 1996) was an American government official accused in 1948 of having spied for the Soviet Union in the 1930s. The statute of limitations had expired for espionage, but he was convicted of perjury in connection with this charge in 1950. Before the trial, Hiss was involved in the establishment of the United Nations, both as a U.S. State Department official and as a UN official. In later life, he worked as a lecturer and author.

On August 3, 1948, Whittaker Chambers, a former Communist Party USA member, testified under subpoena before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) that Hiss had secretly been a communist while in federal service. Hiss categorically denied the charge and subsequently sued Chambers for libel. During the pretrial discovery process of the libel case, Chambers produced new evidence allegedly indicating that he and Hiss had been involved in espionage. A federal grand jury indicted Hiss on two counts of perjury. After a mistrial due to a hung jury, Hiss was tried a second time, and in January 1950 he was found guilty and received two concurrent five-year sentences, of which he eventually served three and a half years.

Arguments about the case and the validity of the verdict took center stage in broader debates about the Cold War, McCarthyism, and the extent of Soviet espionage in the United States.
Since Hiss&#x27;s conviction, statements by involved parties and newly exposed evidence have added to the dispute. In the 1990s, two former senior Soviet military officers responsible for the Soviet Union&#x27;s military intelligence archives stated, following a search of those archives, that the &quot;Russian intelligence service has no documents proving that Alger Hiss cooperated with our service somewhere or anywhere&quot;, and that Hiss &quot;never had any relationship with Soviet intelligence.&quot; The 1995 Venona papers provided evidence for the theory that Hiss was a Soviet spy. Author Anthony Summers argued in 2000 that since many relevant files continue to be unavailable, the Hiss controversy will continue to be debated, with political divisions marking belief in Hiss&#x27;s innocence or guilt. Hiss himself maintained his innocence until his death in 1996.

==Early life and education==
Born in Baltimore, Maryland, on November 11, 1904, Alger Hiss was one of five children of Mary &quot;Minnie&quot; Lavinia (née Hughes) and Charles Alger Hiss. Both parents came from substantial Baltimore families who could trace their roots to the middle of the 18th century. Hiss&#x27;s paternal great-great-grandfather had emigrated from Germany in 1729, and changed his surname from &quot;Hesse&quot; to &quot;Hiss.&quot;

Minnie Hughes attended teacher&#x27;s college and was active in Baltimore society. Shortly after his marriage at age 24, Charles Hiss entered the business world and joined the dry goods importing firm Daniel Miller and Co., where he became an executive and shareholder.

When Charles&#x27; brother John died suddenly at the age of 33, Charles assumed financial and emotional responsibility for his brother&#x27;s widow and six children in addition to his own expanding family. Charles also helped his wife&#x27;s favorite brother, Albert Hughes, find work at Daniel Miller. Hughes at first distinguished himself and was promoted to treasurer of the firm, but then he became involved in a complicated business deal and was unable to meet the financial obligation that was part of a joint agreement.

In 1907, the year of great financial panic, Charles Hiss felt compelled to sell all his stocks to make good his brother-in-law&#x27;s debts and to resign from the firm. After unsuccessful attempts by relatives to find him a job, Charles fell into a serious depression and committed suicide, cutting his throat with a razor. Minnie, who had made the most of her former prosperity and social position, was then forced to rely on her inheritance and financial assistance from family members.

Hiss was two years and his brother was two months old when his father died. As was customary in those days, they were not told of the circumstances of Charles Hiss&#x27;s death. When Alger learned of it inadvertently years later from neighbors, he angrily confronted his older brother Bosley, who then told him the truth. Shocked, Hiss resolved to devote the rest of his life to restoring the family&#x27;s &quot;good name.&quot;

Although shadowed by melancholy, Hiss&#x27;s early childhood, spent in rough-and-tumble games with his siblings and cousins who lived close by, was not unhappy. Their Baltimore neighborhood was described by columnist Murray Kempton as one of &quot;shabby gentility.&quot; Hiss portrayed the economic circumstances of his childhood as &quot;modest,&quot; but &quot;not particularly shabby.&quot; Two further tragedies occurred when Hiss was in his twenties: his elder brother Bosley died of Bright&#x27;s disease and his sister Mary Ann committed suicide.

Hiss learned to compartmentalize and to seek out paternal surrogates. At school, he was popular and high performing. He attended high school at Baltimore City College and college at Johns Hopkins University, where he was voted &quot;most popular student&quot; by his classmates, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa. In 1929, he received his law degree from Harvard Law School, where he was a protégé of Felix Frankfurter, the future US Supreme Court justice. During his time at Harvard, the famous murder trial of anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti took place, ending in their conviction and execution. Like Frankfurter, who wrote a book about the case, and like many prominent liberals of the day, Hiss maintained that Sacco and Vanzetti were convicted unjustly.

Hiss served for a year as clerk to Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., before joining Choate, Hall &amp; Stewart, a Boston law firm, and later the New York City law firm then known as Cotton, Franklin, Wright &amp; Gordon.

==Career==
During the era of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, Hiss became a government attorney. In 1933, he served briefly at the Justice Department and then became a temporary assistant on the Senate&#x27;s Nye Committee, investigating cost overruns and alleged profiteering by military contractors during World War I. During this period, Hiss was also a member of the liberal legal team headed by Jerome Frank that defended the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) against challenges to its legitimacy. Because of intense opposition from agribusiness in Arkansas, Frank and his left-wing assistants, who included future labor lawyer Lee Pressman, were fired in 1935 in what came to be known as &quot;the purge of liberals.&quot; Hiss was not fired, but allegations that during this period he was connected with radicals on the Agriculture Department&#x27;s legal team were to be the source of future controversy.

In the meantime, Hiss also served initially as &quot;investigator&quot; and then &quot;legal assistant&quot; (counsel) to the Nye Committee from July 1934 to August 1935. He &quot;badgered&quot; DuPont officials and questioned and cross-examined Bernard Baruch on March 29, 1935. In 1947, Baruch and Hiss both attended the burial of Nicholas Murray Butler. In 1988, he called Baruch a &quot;vain and overrated Polonius much given to trite pronouncements about the nation.&quot;

In 1936, Alger Hiss and his younger brother Donald Hiss began working under Cordell Hull in the State Department. Alger was an assistant to Assistant Secretary of State Francis B. Sayre (son-in-law of Woodrow Wilson) and then special assistant to the director of the Office of Far Eastern Affairs. From 1939 to 1944, Hiss was an assistant to Stanley Hornbeck, a special adviser to Cordell Hull on Far Eastern affairs.

In 1944, Hiss was named Director of the Office of Special Political Affairs, a policy-making entity devoted to planning for post-war international organizations. Hiss served as executive secretary of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, which drew up plans for the future United Nations. In November 1944, Hull, who had led the United Nations project, retired as Secretary of State due to poor health and was succeeded by Undersecretary of State Edward Stettinius.

In February 1945, as a member of the US delegation headed by Stettinius, Hiss attended the Yalta Conference, where the Big Three, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Joseph Stalin, and Winston Churchill, met to consolidate their alliance to forestall any possibility, now that the Soviets had entered German territory, that any of them might make a separate peace with the Nazi regime. Negotiations addressed the postwar division of Europe and configuration of its borders; reparations and de-Nazification; and the still unfinished plans, carried over from Dumbarton Oaks, for the United Nations. Before the conference took place, Hiss participated in the meetings where the American draft of the &quot;Declaration of Liberated Europe&quot; was created. The Declaration concerned the political future of Eastern Europe and critics on the right later charged that it made damaging concessions to the Soviets.

Hiss stated that he was responsible for assembling background papers and documentation for the conference &quot;and any general matters that might come up relating to the Far East or the Near East.&quot;

Hiss drafted a memorandum arguing against Stalin&#x27;s proposal (made at Dumbarton Oaks) to give one vote to each of the sixteen Soviet republics in the United Nations General Assembly. Fearing isolation, Stalin hoped thus to counterbalance the votes of the many countries of the British Empire, who he anticipated would vote with Britain, and those of Latin America, who could be expected to vote in lockstep with the United States. In the final compromise offered by Roosevelt and Stettinius and accepted by Stalin, the Soviets obtained three votes: one each for the Soviet Union itself, the Ukrainian SSR, and the Byelorussian SSR.

Hiss was Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on International Organization (the convention that created the UN Charter), which was held in San Francisco from April 25, 1945 to June 26, 1945. Allen Weinstein wrote that Andrei Gromyko, the Soviet delegate to the conference, praised Hiss to his superior Stettinius for his &quot;impartiality and fairness.&quot; Hiss later became full Director of the State Department&#x27;s Office of Special Political Affairs. In late 1946, Hiss left government service to become president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where he served until May 5, 1949, the end of the presidential term to which he had been elected, when he was forced to step down.

==Accusation of espionage==
On August 3, 1948, Whittaker Chambers, a former Communist Party member, appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) to denounce Alger Hiss. A senior editor at &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Chambers had written a scathingly satirical editorial critical of the Yalta agreements.
The group, which Chambers called the &quot;Ware Group,&quot; had been organized by agriculturalist Harold Ware, an American communist intent on organizing black and white tenant farmers in the American South against exploitation and debt peonage by the cotton industry (Ware had died in 1935). According to Chambers, &quot;the purpose of this group at that time was not primarily espionage. Its original purpose was the communist infiltration of the American government. But espionage was certainly one of its eventual objectives.&quot; As journalist and author Tim Weiner points out, &quot;This was a crucial point. Infiltration and invisible political influence were immoral, but arguably not illegal. Espionage was treason, traditionally punishable by death. The distinction was not lost on the cleverest member of HUAC, Congressman Richard Nixon... He had been studying the FBI&#x27;s files for five months, courtesy of J. Edgar Hoover. Nixon launched his political career in hot pursuit of Hiss and the alleged secret Communists of the New Deal.&quot;

Rumors had circulated about Hiss since 1939, when Chambers, at the urging of anti-Stalinist Isaac Don Levine, went to Assistant Secretary of State Adolf A. Berle Jr. and accused Hiss of belonging to an underground communist cell at the Department of Agriculture. In 1942, Chambers repeated this allegation to the FBI. In 1945, two other sources emerged to implicate Hiss. In September 1945, Igor Gouzenko, a 26-year-old Ukrainian whose three-year tour as a cipher clerk stationed at the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa was coming to an end, defected from the Soviet Union and remained in Canada. In exchange for asylum, Gouzenko offered to Canadian authorities evidence about a Soviet espionage network actively working to acquire information about nuclear weapons, along with information that an unnamed assistant (or more precisely an &quot;assistant to an assistant&quot;) to US Secretary of State Stettinius was a Soviet agent. When informed of this, Hoover assumed Gouzenko was referring to Alger Hiss. Three months later (in December 1945), Elizabeth Bentley, an American spy for the Soviet Union, who served also as a courier between communist groups, told the FBI, as documented in the FBI Silvermaster File that &quot;At this time Kramer told me that the person who had originally taken Glasser away from Perlo&#x27;s group was named Hiss and that he was in the U.S. State Department.&quot; Bentley also said that the man in question, whom she called &quot;Eugene Hiss&quot; worked in the State Department and was an adviser to Dean Acheson. In both cases (Gouzenko and Bentley), the FBI decided that Alger Hiss was the likely match. Hoover put a wiretap on Hiss&#x27;s home phone and had him and his wife investigated and tailed for the next two years.

In response to Chambers&#x27;s accusations, Hiss protested his innocence and insisted on appearing before HUAC to clear himself. Testifying on August 5, 1948, he denied having ever been a communist or having personally met Chambers. Under fire from President Truman and the press, the Committee was reluctant to proceed with its investigation against so eminent a man. Congressman Richard Nixon, who later described Hiss&#x27;s demeanor that day as, &quot;insolent,&quot; &quot;condescending,&quot; and &quot;insulting in the extreme,&quot; wanted to press on.
Nixon had received secret information about the FBI&#x27;s suspicions from John Francis Cronin, a Roman Catholic priest who had infiltrated labor unions in Baltimore during World War II to report on communist activities and had been given access to FBI files. Writing in a paper titled &quot;The Problem of American Communism In 1945,&quot; Cronin wrote, &quot;In the State Department, the most influential Communist has been Alger Hiss.&quot;

With some reluctance, the Committee voted to make Nixon chair of a subcommittee that would seek to determine who was lying, Hiss or Chambers, at least on the question of whether they knew one another.

Shown a photograph of Chambers, Hiss conceded that the face &quot;might look familiar&quot; and asked to see Chambers in person. Confronted with him in person in a New York hotel where HUAC was holding session, Hiss admitted that he had indeed known Chambers, but under the name &quot;George Crosley,&quot; a man who represented himself as a freelance writer. Hiss said that in the mid-1930s he had sublet his apartment to this &quot;Crosley&quot; and had given him an old car.
Chambers, for his part, denied on the stand ever having used the alias Crosley, though he admitted to Hiss&#x27;s lawyers in private testimony that it could have been one of his pen names. When Hiss and Chambers both appeared before a HUAC subcommittee on August 17, 1948, they had the following exchange:

Chambers&#x27;s statements, because they were made in a Congressional hearing, were privileged against defamation suits; Hiss challenged Chambers to repeat them without benefit of such protection. When, on the national radio program &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, Chambers publicly called Hiss a communist, Hiss had attorney William L. Marbury Jr. file a libel lawsuit against him.

Chambers retaliated by claiming Hiss was not merely a communist, but also a spy, a charge he had not made earlier; and, on November 17, 1948, to support his explosive allegations he produced physical evidence consisting of sixty-five pages of re-typed State Department documents, the last of which was dated April 1, 1938, plus four notes in Hiss&#x27;s handwriting summarizing the contents of State Department cables. These became known as the &quot;Baltimore documents.&quot; Chambers claimed Hiss had given them to him in 1938 and that Priscilla had retyped them (Hiss could not type) on the Hisses&#x27; Woodstock typewriter for Chambers to pass along to the Soviets. One of the handwritten notes copied the contents of a telegram (received January 28, 1938) related to the November and December 1937 arrest and disappearance in Moscow of a Latvian-born man and his wife, an American citizen. Under questioning, neither Hiss nor his superior, Francis Sayre, recollected the incident. Hiss initially denied writing the note, but experts confirmed it was his handwriting. Interrogated in 1949, Sayre stated that the telegram was unrelated to Hiss&#x27;s duties, which concerned trade matters and told his questioners, &quot;He could not understand why he was on the distribution list for this cable nor why the note would be made on it or especially why an exact copy should be made.&quot;

In their previous testimony, both Chambers and Hiss had denied having committed espionage. By introducing the Baltimore documents, Chambers admitted he had previously lied, opening both Hiss and himself to perjury charges. Chambers also gave a new date for his own break with the Communist Party, an important point in his accusations against Hiss. For over nine years, beginning September 1, 1939, he had claimed to have quit the Party in 1937. Chambers now began to claim the actual date was sometime in early March 1938, the year of the &quot;Baltimore documents,&quot; before finally settling during the trial, on April 15, 1938.

On December 2, Chambers led HUAC investigators to a pumpkin patch on his Maryland farm; from a hollowed-out pumpkin in which he had hidden them the previous day, he produced five rolls of 35 mm film that he said came from Hiss in 1938, as well. While some of the film was undeveloped and some contained images of trivial content such as publicly available Navy documents concerning the painting of fire extinguishers, there were also images of State Department documents that were classified at the time. As a consequence of the revelation&#x27;s dramatic staging, both the film and the Baltimore documents soon became known collectively as the &quot;Pumpkin Papers.&quot;

==Perjury trials and conviction==

The grand jury charged Hiss with two counts of perjury. He was not indicted for espionage since the period of limitations had run out. Chambers was never charged with a crime. Hiss went to trial twice. The first trial, presided over by Judge Samuel Kaufman, started on May 31, 1949, and ended in a hung jury on July 7. Chambers admitted on the witness stand that he had previously committed perjury several times while he was under oath, including deliberately falsifying key dates in his story. Hiss&#x27;s character witnesses at his first trial included such notables as future Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson, Supreme Court Justices Felix Frankfurter and Stanley Reed, and former Democratic presidential candidate John W. Davis. President Truman famously called the investigation &quot;a red herring.&quot; The second trial, presided over by Judge Henry W. Goddard, lasted from November 17, 1949, to January 21, 1950.

At both trials, a key to the prosecution&#x27;s case was testimony from expert witnesses, stating that identifying characteristics of the typed Baltimore documents matched samples typed on a typewriter owned by the Hisses at the time of his alleged espionage work with Chambers. The prosecution also presented as evidence the typewriter itself. Given away years earlier, it had been located by defense investigators. This trial resulted in an eight-to-four deadlocked jury. &quot;That, according to one of Hiss&#x27;s friends and lawyers, Helen Buttenweiser, was the only time that she had ever seen Alger shocked—stunned by the fact that eight of his fellow citizens did not believe him.&quot;

In the second trial, Hede Massing, an Austria-born confessed Soviet spy who was being threatened with deportation, and whom the first judge had not permitted to testify, provided some slight corroboration of Chambers&#x27;s story. She recounted meeting Hiss at a party in 1935. Massing also described how Hiss had tried to recruit Noel Field, another Soviet spy at State, to switch from Massing&#x27;s ring to his own.

This time the jury found Hiss guilty. According to Anthony Summers, &quot;Hiss spoke only two sentences in court after he had been found guilty. The first was to thank the judge. The second was to assert that one day in the future it would be disclosed how forgery by typewriter had been committed.&quot;

On January 25, 1950, Judge Goddard sentenced Hiss to five years&#x27; imprisonment on each of the two counts, to run concurrently.

At a subsequent press conference, Secretary of State Dean Acheson reacted emotionally, affirming, &quot;I do not intend to turn my back on Alger Hiss.&quot; Acheson quoted Jesus in the Bible: &quot;I was a Stranger and ye took me in; Naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick and ye visited me; I was in prison and ye came unto me.&quot; Acheson&#x27;s remarks enraged Nixon, who called Acheson&#x27;s words sacrilege. The verdict was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the Supreme Court of the United States denied a writ of certiorari.

The case heightened public concern about Soviet espionage penetration of the US government in the 1930s and 1940s. As a well-educated and highly connected government official from an old American family, Alger Hiss did not fit the profile of a typical spy.

Publicity surrounding the case thrust Nixon into the public spotlight, helping him move from the U.S. House of Representatives to the U.S. Senate in 1950, to the vice-presidency of the United States in 1952, and finally to the presidency in 1968.

Senator Joseph McCarthy made his famous speech at Wheeling, West Virginia, two weeks after the Hiss verdict, launching his career as the nation&#x27;s most visible anti-communist.

==Incarceration==
On March 22, 1951, Alger Hiss was sent to a maximum security federal facility. Although he had been sentenced to five years&#x27; imprisonment, Hiss served only three years and eight months in Lewisburg Federal Prison. He was released from prison on November 27, 1954.

While in prison, Hiss acted as a volunteer attorney, adviser, and tutor for many of his fellow inmates.

==Post-incarceration==
After his release in 1954 at age 50, Hiss, who had been disbarred, worked as a salesman for a stationery company in New York City. From 1958 to 1960 he worked as an administrative assistant to R. Andrew Smith, a comb manufacturer, earning $20,000/year. In 1957, he published &quot;In the Court of Public Opinion&quot;, a book challenging in detail the prosecution&#x27;s case against him, and maintaining the typewritten documents traced to his typewriter had been forged. Hiss separated from his first wife, Priscilla, in 1959, though they remained married until her death in 1984. In 1985 he married Isabel Johnson, who had been living with him since soon after they met in 1960.

On November 11, 1962, following Richard Nixon&#x27;s failed 1962 bid for governor of California, Hiss appeared in a segment titled &quot;The Political Obituary of Richard M. Nixon&quot; on the &quot;Howard K. Smith: News and Comment&quot; show on ABC television. (The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported targets of Hiss&#x27;s &quot;invective&quot; and whom he &quot;denounced as conspirators in a monstrous plot to convict him on concocted evidence&quot; included: the presiding judge at his second trial, the three appellate court judges who rejected his appeal, J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI, assistant attorney general Alexander M. Campbell, federal prosecutor Thomas F. Murphy, members of the New York grand jury who indicted him, jury members in his two trials who convicted him, and HUAC members and particularly Richard Nixon and Karl Mundt.&quot;) His appearance led sponsors to withdraw from Smith&#x27;s program when viewers bombarded ABC with complaints about letting a convicted perjurer appear on the air. Smith&#x27;s show was cancelled in June 1963.

The five rolls of 35 mm film known as the &quot;pumpkin papers&quot; had been characterized as highly classified and too sensitive to reveal and were thought until late 1974 to be locked in HUAC files. In 1975, independent researcher Stephen W. Salant, an economist at the University of Michigan, sued the US Justice Department when it denied his request for access to them under the Freedom of Information Act. On July 31, 1975, as a result of this lawsuit and follow-on suits filed by Peter Irons and by Alger Hiss and William A. Reuben, the Justice Department released copies of the &quot;pumpkin papers&quot; that had been used to implicate Hiss. One roll of film turned out to be totally blank due to overexposure,
two others are faintly legible copies of non-classified Navy Department documents relating to such subjects as life rafts and fire extinguishers, and the remaining two are photographs of the State Department documents that had been introduced at the two Hiss trials.
A few days after the release of the Pumpkin Papers, on August 5, 1975, Hiss was readmitted to the Massachusetts bar. The state&#x27;s Supreme Judicial Court overruled its Committee of Bar Overseers
and stated in a unanimous decision that, despite his conviction, Hiss had demonstrated the &quot;moral and intellectual fitness&quot; required to be an attorney. Hiss was the first lawyer ever readmitted to the Massachusetts bar after a major criminal conviction.

In 1988, Hiss wrote an autobiography, &quot;Recollections of a Life&quot;, in which he maintained his innocence. He fought his perjury conviction until his death from emphysema on November 15, 1996, at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, four days after his 92nd birthday.

==Personal life==

In 1929, Hiss married Priscilla Fansler Hobson, a Bryn Mawr graduate and grade school teacher. Priscilla, previously married to Thayer Hobson, had a three-year-old son, Timothy Hobson (September 19, 1926 – January 8, 2018). Hiss and Priscilla had a son, Tony Hiss. The couple separated in 1959 after 30 years of marriage, five years after his incarceration.

In the 1960s, Hiss was introduced to Isabel (Dowden) Johnson, a model, freelance writer, and editor. Though Hiss asked Priscilla for a divorce so they could marry, she did not grant him one. Johnson had a previous relationship with Communist writer Howard Fast, recipient of the Stalin Peace Prize, and had briefly married Communist screenwriter Lester Cole, of the Hollywood Ten.

After Priscilla’s death in 1984, Hiss and Johnson married in 1986. Hiss was an Episcopalian.

Hiss was conferred an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1947.

==Later evidence, for and against==

===Testimony by Bullitt and Weyl===
In 1952, former U.S. Ambassador to France William C. Bullitt testified before the McCarran Committee (the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee) that in 1939, Premier Édouard Daladier had advised him of French intelligence reports that two State Department officials named Hiss were Soviet agents. When asked about it the next day, Daladier, then 68 years old, told reporters that he did not recall this conversation from 13 years previously. Also called to testify before the McCarran committee was economist Nathaniel Weyl, a former Communist Party member &quot;at large&quot; who had worked for the Department of Agriculture during the early days of the New Deal and had become disillusioned with what he considered the underhanded methods of the Communist Party. In 1950 Weyl had been interviewed by the FBI and had told them that in 1933 he had belonged to a secret Communist Party unit along with Harold Ware and Lee Pressman and confirmed that Alger Hiss had been present at some meetings held at Ware&#x27;s sister&#x27;s violin studio. In 1950, Weyl published an anti-communist book, &quot;Treason: The Story of Disloyalty and Betrayal in American History&quot;, that made no mention of the so-called &quot;Ware Group&quot; and expressed doubt that Hiss was guilty of espionage.

===Forgery by typewriter hypothesis===
At both trials, FBI typewriter experts testified that the Baltimore documents in Chambers&#x27;s possession matched samples of typing done in the 1930s by Priscilla Hiss on the Hisses&#x27; home typewriter, a Woodstock brand. At both trials, the testimony was directed to comparing two sets of typed documents and not to the typewriter eventually submitted into evidence. As early as December 1948 the chief investigator for the Hiss defense, Horace W. Schmahl, set off a race to find Hiss&#x27;s typewriter. The FBI, with superior resources, was also searching for the typewriter, which the Hiss family had discarded some years earlier. Schmahl tracked it down first, and the Hiss defense introduced it with the intention of showing that its typeface would not be a match for that on the FBI&#x27;s documents. It instead proved an excellent match and confirmed the FBI&#x27;s evidence. Schmahl subsequently changed sides and went to work for the prosecution.

After Hiss had gone to prison, his lawyer, Chester T. Lane, acting on a tip he had received from someone who had worked with Schmahl that Hiss might have been framed, filed a motion in January 1952 for a new trial. Lane sought to show that forgery by typewriter was feasible, and that such forgery had occurred in the Hiss case and was responsible for the incriminating documents. Unaware that the feasibility of such forgeries had already been established throughout the war by the military intelligence services that engaged in such practices, the Hiss defense team sought to establish feasibility directly by hiring a civilian typewriter expert, Martin Tytell, to create a typewriter that would be indistinguishable from the one the Hisses owned. Tytell spent two years creating a facsimile Woodstock typewriter whose print characteristics would match the peculiarities of the Hiss typewriter.

To demonstrate that forgery by typewriter was not merely a theoretical possibility but had actually occurred in the Hiss case, the defense sought to show that Exhibit #UUU was not Hiss&#x27;s old machine but a newer one altered to type like it. According to former Woodstock executives, the production date of a machine could be inferred from the machine&#x27;s serial number. The serial number on the Exhibit #UUU typewriter indicated that it would have been &quot;manufactured after&quot; the man who sold the Hiss machine had retired from the company, and the salesman insisted that he did not sell any typewriters after his retirement. Decades later, when FBI files were disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, it turned out that the FBI had also doubted that the trial exhibit was Hiss&#x27;s machine and for exactly the same reasons; although the FBI expressed these concerns internally as the first trial was about to begin, the public did not learn about the FBI&#x27;s doubts until the mid-1970s.

To explain why typing from Exhibit #UUU seemed indistinguishable from the typing on Hiss&#x27;s old machine, Lane assembled experts prepared to testify that Exhibit #UUU had been tampered with in a way inconsistent with professional repair work to make it type like Hiss&#x27;s old typewriter. In addition, experts were prepared to testify that Priscilla Hiss was not the typist of the Baltimore documents.
In summarizing the conclusions of the forensic experts he had assembled in his motion for a new trial, Lane told the court, &quot;I no longer just question the authenticity of Woodstock N230099. I now say to the Court that Woodstock N230099—the typewriter in evidence at the trials—is a fake machine. I present in affidavit form, and will be able to produce at the hearing, expert testimony that this machine is a deliberately fabricated job, a new type face on an old body. This being so, it can only have been planted on the defense by or on behalf of Whittaker Chambers as part of his plot for the false incrimination of Alger Hiss.&quot;

In July 1952 Judge Goddard denied Hiss&#x27;s motion for a new trial, expressing great skepticism that Chambers had the resources, knew how to commit forgery by typewriter, and would have known where to plant such a fake machine so it would be found. In his decision, Goddard did not address the possibility, raised by Hiss&#x27;s defenders, that someone other than Chambers, namely Horace Schmahl and/or his associates on the prosecution side, might have been involved in faking the typewriter.

In 1976, Hiss called ex-FBI official William C. Sullivan, who recounted in his 1979 memoir:In 1976, five years after I left the FBI, I got a telephone call at my home in New Hampshire from Alger Hiss. Still working on his case, he wanted me to tell him whether the typewriter that helped convict him of a perjury charge was a fake which had been put together at the FBI Laboratory.&lt;br&gt;Although I never worked on the Hiss case myself, I knew that we were giving Richard Nixon, who was in charge of the investigation, every possible assistance. Had Nixon asked the FBI to manufacture evidence to provide his case against Hiss, Hoover would have been only too glad to oblige. I told Hiss that the typewriter was not made in the FBI Lab. What I didn&#x27;t tell him was that even if we had wanted to, we simply wouldn&#x27;t have been capable of it.Based on Justice Department documents released in 1976, the Hiss defense filed a petition in federal court in July 1978 for a writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot;, asking that the guilty verdict be overturned due to prosecutorial misconduct. In 1982, the Federal Court denied the petition, and in 1983 the US Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal. In the writ, Hiss&#x27;s attorneys argued the following:

* The FBI illegally withheld important evidence from the Hiss defense team, specifically that typewritten documents could be forged. Unbeknownst to the defense, military intelligence operatives in World War II, a decade before the trials, &quot;could reproduce faultlessly the imprint of any typewriter on earth.&quot;
* With regard to the Woodstock No. 230099 typewriter introduced as Exhibit #UUU by the defense at the trial, the FBI knew there was an inconsistency between its serial number and the manufacture date of Hiss&#x27;s machine but illegally withheld this information from Hiss.
* That the FBI had an informer on the Hiss defense team, a private detective named Horace W. Schmahl. Hired by the Hiss defense team, Schmahl reported on the Hiss defense strategy to the government.
* That the FBI had conducted illegal surveillance of Hiss before and during the trials, including phone taps and mail openings. Also that the prosecution had withheld from Hiss and his lawyers the records of this surveillance, none of which provided any evidence that Hiss was a spy or a communist.
Federal Judge Owen, in denying Hiss&#x27;s &quot;coram nobis&quot; petition, quoted verbatim two points made by Judge Goddard in denying Hiss&#x27;s appeal for a new trial 30 years earlier, namely, that &quot;there is not a trace of any evidence that Chambers had the mechanical skills, tools, equipment or material for such a difficult task [as typewriter forgery],&quot; and that &quot;If Chambers had constructed a duplicate machine, how would he have known where to plant it so that it would be found by Hiss?&quot;

Stephen Salant, whose FOIA requests had revealed to the public the contents of the &quot;pumpkin papers,&quot; has documented that Schmahl was a trained Army &quot;spy-catcher&quot; (as they called themselves), a special agent in the Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC). While on the payroll of the Hiss defense and searching for Hiss&#x27;s typewriter, Schmahl confided to the FBI that his &quot;present employment&quot; in December 1948 was with Military Intelligence; his claim has not yet been independently verified.
At the Military Intelligence Training Center, CIC agents learned the rudiments of forgery and how to detect it through matching of typed samples with the typewriter that produced them. During the 1940s the CIC&#x27;s domestic surveillance of civilians was extensive but so covert that it usually escaped notice. When detected, undercover CIC agents were often mistaken for FBI agents, since only the Bureau was authorized to investigate civilians.
During the 1930s Army counterintelligence monitored another suspected communist connected to Chambers, Franklin Vincent Reno, a civilian employed at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, who shortly afterwards passed information about US Army weapons to Chambers.
It is not known if US Army counterintelligence monitored Chambers&#x27; other associates, but when Hiss presided over the UN Charter Conference, more than a hundred undercover CIC agents were in attendance.

In his 1976 memoir, former White House counsel John Dean states that President Nixon&#x27;s chief counsel Charles Colson told him that Nixon had admitted in a conversation that HUAC had fabricated a typewriter, saying, &quot;We built one on the Hiss case.&quot;
According to Anthony Summers: &quot;When Dean&#x27;s book was published, Colson protested that he had &#x27;no recollection of Nixon&#x27;s having said the typewriter was &#x27;phonied.&#x27;&quot; Nixon called the claim &quot;totally false.&quot; Dean insisted that his contemporaneous notes confirmed that Colson had quoted the President as he indicated and seemed serious when he did so.
Summers and others suggest that Dean&#x27;s version of events is plausible: &quot;&#x27;Had Nixon asked the FBI to manufacture evidence to prove his case against Hiss,&#x27; opined former FBI Assistant Director Sullivan, &#x27;Hoover would actually been only too glad to oblige.&#x27;&quot; As to whether Nixon would actually have gone as far as to frame Hiss, Summers notes, &quot;the later record includes disquieting instances of forgery or planting false information.&quot;
Cold War historian John V. Fleming disagrees, arguing that on the White House tapes Nixon never says anything that would have corroborated Colson&#x27;s statement to John Dean about forging a typewriter in the Hiss case. Fleming and others maintain that the indistinct phrase during a conversation with John Dean that sounded to certain transcribers like &quot;we made a typewriter&quot; is actually a reference to Hiss&#x27;s legal team. Throughout the tapes Nixon stresses how he had tried Hiss in the press, not the law courts, because that&#x27;s how these things were done:We won the Hiss case in the papers. We did. I had to leak stuff all over the place. Because the Justice Department would not prosecute it. Hoover didn&#x27;t even cooperate... It was won in the papers. I leaked out the papers... I leaked out the testimony. I had Hiss convicted before he ever got to the grand jury... Go back and read the chapter on the Hiss case in &quot;Six Crises&quot; and you&#x27;ll see how it was done. It wasn&#x27;t done waiting for the goddamn courts or the attorney general or the FBI.

According to Anthony Summers: The one substantive piece of information indicating typewriter forgery features the OSS and its chief, William Donovan. In late 1948, when the Hiss defense and the FBI began hunting for the Woodstock typewriter, a man named Horace Schmahl joined the defense team as an investigator. Schmahl had worked for either the OSS or army intelligence during the war, then joined the Central Intelligence Group, which operated between the closedown of the OSS and the inception of the CIA. After his stint for the Hiss side, Schmahl defected to the prosecution team.

Against the forged typewriter theory Allen Weinstein writes: [I]f there existed any persons with the means, motive, and opportunity to &quot;substitute&quot; a different Woodstock for the Hiss machine in the months after Hiss&#x27;s indictment, the evidence ... indicates the possible conspirators, Mike Catlett and Donald Hiss, who for two months withheld knowledge from Alger&#x27;s lawyers that the typewriter had been traced to Ira Lockey. 

===Noel Field===

In 1992, records were found in Hungarian Interior Ministry archives in which self-confessed Soviet spy Noel Field named Alger Hiss as a fellow agent. An American citizen from a Quaker family who had grown up in Switzerland, Field attended Harvard and worked in the US Foreign Service from 1929 until 1936, when he left the State Department for a job at the League of Nations in Geneva, helping refugees from the Spanish Civil War. During World War II, Field, who never concealed he was a communist, headed a Unitarian Universalist Service Committee organization to aid displaced persons in Marseilles, before fleeing to Geneva, where he collaborated with Allen Dulles of the OSS (who was based in Bern). In 1948, when the Hiss trials started, Field and his German wife were still living in Switzerland. By 1949 Field was broke, having been fired from the US-based Unitarian Service Committee for his communist associations. Wishing to avoid returning to the United States and possibly having to testify before Congress, Field traveled to Prague, hoping to be hired as a lecturer at the Charles University. Instead, he was seized by Stalinist security services from Poland and Czechoslovakia and secretly imprisoned in Hungary. Field was accused of having organized an anti-communist resistance network in Eastern Europe for the OSS during the war and later for the new CIA and was held for five years in solitary confinement. Repeatedly interrogated under rigorous torture, Field broke down and confessed to being &quot;head of the U.S. Secret Service,&quot; under his controller, Allen Dulles, &quot;the famous pro-Nazi OSS spymaster.&quot;

While being &quot;rehabilitated&quot; after the torture had ceased, Field referred four times to Hiss as a Soviet agent, for example: &quot;Around the summer of 1935 Alger Hiss tried to induce me to do service for the Soviets. I was indiscreet enough to tell him he had come too late.&quot; This agreed with Hede Massing&#x27;s assertion to US authorities in 1947 that when she attempted to recruit Noel Field for one Soviet spy network (the OGPU), Field had replied that he already worked for another (the GRU). (Massing repeated this story at Hiss&#x27;s second trial when she testified that at a party at Noel Field&#x27;s house in 1935 she had obliquely joked with Hiss about recruiting Noel Field.)
In 1954, the Hungarian secret police released Field, exonerating him. He then formally wrote to the Communist Party&#x27;s Central Committee in Moscow stating for the record that the tortures he had undergone in captivity had made him &quot;confess more and more lies as truth.&quot; Hiss&#x27;s defenders argue that Field&#x27;s implications of Hiss may well have been among those lies. Field remained in communist Hungary until his death in 1970. In public, Field continued to maintain Hiss was innocent and, in 1957, wrote Hiss a letter calling Hede Massing&#x27;s dinner party story &quot;the false testimony of a perjured witness&quot; and an &quot;outrageous lie.&quot;

===Venona and &quot;ALES&quot;===
In 1995, the CIA and the NSA for the first time made public the existence of the World War II Venona project, which, beginning in 1943, had decrypted or partially decrypted thousands of telegrams sent from 1940 to 1948 to the primary Soviet foreign intelligence agency—for most of that period, the NKVD—by its US operatives. Although known to the FBI, Venona had been kept secret even from President Truman. One cable, Venona #1822, mentioned a Soviet spy codenamed &quot;ALES&quot; who worked with a group of &quot;Neighbors&quot;—members of another Soviet intelligence organization, such as the military&#x27;s GRU. FBI Special Agent Robert J. Lamphere, who supervised the FBI&#x27;s spy chasing squad, concluded that the codename &quot;ALES&quot; was &quot;probably Alger Hiss.&quot;

In 1997, Allen Weinstein, in the second edition of his 1978 book &quot;&quot;, calls the Venona evidence &quot;persuasive but not conclusive.&quot; The bipartisan Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy, chaired by Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, stated in its findings that year: &quot;The complicity of Alger Hiss of the State Department seems settled. As does that of Harry Dexter White of the Treasury Department.&quot; In his 1998 book &quot;Secrecy: The American Experience&quot;, Moynihan wrote, &quot;Belief in the guilt or innocence of Alger Hiss became a defining issue in American intellectual life. Parts of the American government had conclusive evidence of his guilt, but they never told.&quot; In their numerous books, Harvey Klehr, professor of political science at Emory University, and John Earl Haynes, historian of twentieth-century politics at the Library of Congress, have mounted an energetic defense of Lamphere&#x27;s conclusion that ALES indeed referred to Alger Hiss. National Security Agency analysts have also gone on record asserting that ALES could only have been Alger Hiss. The Venona transcript # 1822, sent March 30, 1945, from the Soviets&#x27; Washington station chief to Moscow, appears to indicate that ALES attended the February 4–11, 1945, Yalta conference and then went to Moscow. Hiss did attend Yalta and then traveled to Moscow with Secretary of State Stettinius.

Some have questioned whether Venona #1822 constitutes definitive proof that ALES was Hiss. Hiss&#x27;s lawyer, John Lowenthal argued:

* ALES was said to be the leader of a small group of espionage agents but, apart from using his wife as a typist and Chambers as courier, Hiss was alleged by the prosecution to have acted alone. The CIA concluded the &quot;small group&quot; comprised Alger, his wife Priscilla, and brother Donald.
* ALES was a GRU (military intelligence) agent who obtained military intelligence and only rarely provided State Department material. In contrast, during his trial, Hiss, an employee of the State Department, was accused of having obtained only non-military information, and the papers he was accused of having passed to the Soviets on a regular basis were non-military, State Department documents.
* Even had Hiss been a spy as alleged, after 1938 he would have been unlikely to have continued espionage activities as ALES did, since in 1938 Whittaker Chambers had broken with the Communist Party and gone into hiding, threatening to denounce his Communist Party colleagues unless they followed suit. Had Hiss been ALES, his cover would thus have been in extreme jeopardy, and it would have been too risky for any Soviet agency to continue using him.
*Lowenthal suggests that ALES was not at the Yalta conference at all and that the cable instead was directed to Soviet deputy foreign minister Andrey Vyshinsky. According to Lowenthal, in paragraph six of Venona #1822, the GRU asks Vyshinsky to get in touch with ALES to convey thanks from the GRU for a job well done—which would have been unnecessary if ALES had actually gone to Moscow, because the GRU could have thanked him there in person.

Eduard Mark of the Center for Air Force History hotly disputed this analysis. In 2005, the NSA released the original Russian of the Venona texts. At a symposium held at the Center for Cryptologic History that year, intelligence historian John R. Schindler concluded that the Russian text of Venona #1822 made clear that ALES was indeed at Yalta: &quot;the identification of ALES as Alger Hiss, made by the U.S. Government more than a half-century ago, seems exceptionally solid, based on the evidence now available; message 1822 is only one piece of that evidence, yet a compelling one.&quot;

Rebutting Lowenthal&#x27;s other points, John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr argued that:
* None of the evidence presented at the Hiss trial precludes the possibility that Hiss could have been an espionage agent after 1938 or that he had only passed State Department documents after 1938.
* Chambers&#x27;s charges were not seriously investigated until 1945 when Elizabeth Bentley defected, so the Soviets could in theory have considered it an acceptable risk for him to continue his espionage work even after Chambers&#x27;s 1938 defection.
* Vyshinsky was not in the US between Yalta and the time of the Venona message, and the message is from the Washington KGB station reporting on a talk with ALES in the US, rendering Lowenthal&#x27;s analysis impossible.

An earlier Venona document, #1579, had actually mentioned &quot;HISS&quot; by name. This partially decrypted cable consists of fragments of a 1943 message from the GRU chief in New York to headquarters in Moscow and reads: &quot;from the State Department by name of HISS&quot; (with &quot;HISS&quot; &quot;spelled out in the Latin alphabet,&quot; according to a footnote by the cryptanalysts). &quot;HISS&quot; could refer either to Alger or Donald Hiss, both State Department officials at that time. Lowenthal argued that had Alger Hiss really been a spy, the GRU would not have mentioned his real name in a coded transmission, since this was contrary to their usual practice.

At an April 2007 symposium, authors Kai Bird and Svetlana Chervonnaya postulated that, based on the movements of officials present at Yalta, Wilder Foote, a US diplomat, not Hiss, was the best match for ALES. They note Foote was in Mexico City when a Soviet cable placed ALES there, whereas Hiss had left several days earlier for Washington (see above). In response, Haynes and Klehr point out that Foote doesn&#x27;t fit other aspects of the description of ALES (Foote was publishing newspapers in Vermont at the time when ALES was said to have been working for Soviet military intelligence) and suggest that the cable came from someone who managed KGB assets (rather than GRU assets like ALES) and may have been mistaken when he stated that ALES was still in Mexico City. Mark also disputes that Foote was ALES, arguing that Foote was never shown to be associated with the communists or any foreign intelligence services; Hiss was the &quot;one possible candidate&quot; who could have been ALES, Mark contends.

===Oleg Gordievsky===

In 1985, a high-ranking KGB agent, Oleg Gordievsky (b. 1938), who was recruited in 1974 as a British double agent, defected and wrote a series of memoirs, in one of which, &quot;The KGB&quot; (1990), he recalled attending a lecture given before a KGB audience by Iskhak Abdulovich Akhmerov, who identified Hiss as a World War II Soviet agent.
Gordievsky went further and claimed that Hiss had the codename identity of &quot;ALES.&quot; Appearing before the Venona cables were made public, this at first appeared to be independent corroboration of the codename, but it was later revealed that Gordievsky&#x27;s source for the ALES identity was an article by journalist Thomas Powell, who had seen National Security Agency documents on Venona years before their release. Gordievsky&#x27;s status as a reliable source was challenged in sections of the British media.

===Soviet archives===

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Alger Hiss petitioned General Dmitry Antonovich Volkogonov, who had become Russian president Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s military advisor and the overseer of all the Soviet intelligence archives, to request the release of any Soviet files on the Hiss case. Both former President Nixon and the director of his presidential library, John H. Taylor, wrote similar letters, though their full contents are not yet publicly available.

Russian archivists responded by reviewing their files, and in late 1992 reported back that they had found no evidence Hiss ever engaged in espionage for the Soviet Union nor that he was a member of the Communist Party. Volkogonov subsequently stated he spent only two days on the search and had mainly relied on the word of KGB archivists. &quot;What I saw gave me no basis to claim a full clarification,&quot; he said. Referring to Hiss&#x27;s lawyer, he added, &quot;John Lowenthal pushed me to say things of which I was not fully convinced.&quot; General-Lieutenant Vitaly Pavlov, who ran Soviet intelligence work in North America in the late 1930s and early 1940s for the NKVD said that Hiss never worked for the USSR as one of his agents.

In 2003, retired Russian intelligence official General Julius Kobyakov disclosed that it was he who had actually searched the files for Volkogonov. Kobyakov stated that Hiss did not have a relationship with SVR predecessor organizations, although Hiss was accused of being with the GRU, a military intelligence organization separate from SVR predecessors. In 2007, Svetlana Chervonnaya, a Russian researcher who had been studying Soviet archives since the early 1990s, argued that based on documents she reviewed, Hiss was not implicated in spying. In May 2009, at a conference hosted by the Wilson Center, Mark Kramer, director of Cold War Studies at Harvard University at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, stated that he did not &quot;trust a word [Kobyakov] says,&quot; At the same conference, historian Ronald Radosh reported that while researching the papers of Marshal Voroshilov in Moscow, he and Mary Habeck had encountered two GRU (Soviet military intelligence) files referring to Alger Hiss as &quot;our agent.&quot;

In 2009, Haynes, Klehr, and Alexander Vassiliev published &quot;Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America&quot;, based on KGB documents reportedly hand-copied by Vassiliev, a former KGB agent, during the 1990s. The authors attempted to show definitively that Alger Hiss had indeed been a Soviet spy and argue that KGB documents prove not only that Hiss was the elusive ALES, but that he also went by the codenames &quot;Jurist&quot; and &quot;Leonard&quot; while working for the GRU. Some documentation brought back by Vassiliev also refers to Hiss by his actual name, leaving no room, in the authors&#x27; opinion, for doubt about his guilt. Calling this the &quot;massive weight of accumulated evidence,&quot; Haynes and Klehr conclude, &quot;to serious students of history continued claims for Hiss&#x27;s innocence are akin to a terminal case of ideological blindness.&quot; In a review published in the &quot;Journal of Cold War Studies&quot;, military historian Eduard Mark heartily concurred, stating that the documents &quot;conclusively show that Hiss was, as Whittaker Chambers charged more than six decades ago, an agent of Soviet military intelligence (GRU) in the 1930s.&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine reported that Civil Rights Movement historian David Garrow also concluded that, in his opinion, &quot;Spies&quot; &quot;provides irrefutable confirmation of [Hiss&#x27;s] guilt.&quot;

Other historians, such as D. D. Guttenplan, Jeff Kisseloff, and Amy Knight, assert that &quot;Spies&quot;″ conclusions were not borne out by the evidence and accused its authors of engaging in &quot;shoddy&quot; research. Guttenplan stresses that Haynes and Klehr never saw and cannot even prove the existence of the documents that supposedly convict Hiss and others of espionage, but rather relied exclusively on handwritten notebooks authored by Vassiliev during the time he was given access to the Soviet archives in the 1990s while he collaborated with Weinstein. According to Guttenplan, Vassiliev could never explain how he managed, despite being required to leave his files and notebooks in a safe at the KGB press office at the end of each day, to smuggle out the notebooks with his extensive transcriptions of documents. Haynes and Klehr respond that the material was examined by historians, archivists, and intelligence professionals who unanimously agreed that the material was genuine.

Guttenplan also suggested, moreover, that Vassiliev might have omitted relevant facts and selectively replaced cover names with his own notion of the real names of various persons. According to Guttenplan, Boris Labusov, a press officer of the SVR, the successor to the KGB, has stated that Vassiliev could not in the course of his research have possibly &quot;met the name of Alger Hiss in the context of some cooperation with some special services of the Soviet Union.&quot; Guttenplan also points out that Vasiliev admitted under oath in 2003 that he&#x27;d never seen a single document linking Hiss with the cover name &quot;Ales.&quot; Haynes and Klehr also cite a 1950 memo indicating that a GRU agent, described as a senior State Department official, had recently been convicted in an American court. &quot;The only senior American diplomat convicted of an espionage-related crime in 1950 was Alger Hiss.&quot;

Historian Jeff Kisseloff questions Haynes and Klehr&#x27;s conclusion that Vassiliev&#x27;s notes support Hede Massing&#x27;s story about talking to Hiss at a party in 1935 about recruiting their mutual friend and host Noel Field into the communist underground. According to Kisseloff, &quot;all that the files Vassiliev saw really indicate is that she was telling yet another version of her story in the 1930s. Haynes and Klehr never consider that, as an agent in Washington, DC, who was having little success in the tasks assigned to her, she may have felt pressure back then to make up a few triumphs to reassure her superiors.&quot; Kisseloff also disputes Haynes and Klehr&#x27;s linking of Hiss with former Treasury Department official Harold Glasser, who they allege was a Soviet agent. Finally, Kisseloff states that some of the evidence compiled by Haynes and Klehr actually tends to exonerate rather than convict Hiss. For example, their book cites a KGB report from 1938 in which Iskhak Akhmerov, New York station chief, writes, &quot;I don&#x27;t know for sure who Hiss is connected with.&quot; Haynes and Klehr also claim that Hiss was the agent who used the cover name &quot;Doctor.&quot; According to some Soviet sources, &quot;Doctor&quot; was a middle-aged Bessarabian Jew who was educated in Vienna.

Other historians felt that Haynes and Klehr&#x27;s information was suspect because their publisher, Crown (a division of Random House), obtained temporary and limited access to KGB files through a payment of money (amount unspecified) to a pension fund for retired KGB agents, of whom Vassiliev was one, as was KGB archivist Volkogonov. Other historians had not been permitted to verify Vassiliev&#x27;s data. In 2002, Vassiliev sued John Lowenthal for libel in a British court of law for publishing a journal article questioning his conclusions. Vassiliev lost the case before a jury and was further reprimanded by &quot;The Times&quot; for trying to exert a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on scholarship by resorting to the law courts. Vassiliev has since also unsuccessfully sued Amazon for publishing a customer review critical of his work.

In 1978, Victor Navasky interviewed six people Weinstein had quoted in his book &quot;Perjury&quot;, who all claimed to have been misquoted by Weinstein. One, Sam Krieger, won a cash payment from Weinstein, who issued an apology and promised to correct future editions of his book and to release his interview transcripts, which he subsequently failed to do.

<doc id="86350" wikidata="Q101843" url="?curid=86350" title="Period (periodic table)">
<text>A period on the periodic table is a row of chemical elements. All elements in a row have the same number of electron shells. Each next element in a period has one more proton and is less metallic than its predecessor. Arranged this way, elements in the same group (column) have similar chemical and physical properties, reflecting the periodic law. For example, the halogens lie in the second-to-last group (group 17) and share similar properties, such as high reactivity and the tendency to gain one electron to arrive at a noble-gas electronic configuration. , a total of 118 elements have been discovered and confirmed.
Modern quantum mechanics explains these periodic trends in properties in terms of electron shells. As atomic number increases, shells fill with electrons in approximately the order shown in the ordering rule diagram. The filling of each shell corresponds to a row in the table.

In the f-block and p-block of the periodic table, elements within the same period generally do not exhibit trends and similarities in properties (vertical trends down groups are more significant). However, in the d-block, trends across periods become significant, and in the f-block elements show a high degree of similarity across periods.

==Periods==
There are currently seven complete periods in the periodic table, comprising the 118 known elements. Any new elements will be placed into an eighth period; see extended periodic table. The elements are colour-coded below by their block: red for the s-block, yellow for the p-block, blue for the d-block, and green for the f-block.

===Period 1===
The first period contains fewer elements than any other, with only two, hydrogen and helium. They therefore do not follow the octet rule, but rather a duplet rule. Chemically, helium behaves like a noble gas, and thus is taken to be part of the group 18 elements. However, in terms of its nuclear structure it belongs to the s-block, and is therefore sometimes classified as a group 2 element, or simultaneously both 2 and 18. Hydrogen readily loses and gains an electron, and so behaves chemically as both a group 1 and a group 17 element.

*Hydrogen (H) is the most abundant of the chemical elements, constituting roughly 75% of the universe&#x27;s elemental mass. Ionized hydrogen is just a proton. Stars in the main sequence are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state. Elemental hydrogen is relatively rare on Earth, and is industrially produced from hydrocarbons such as methane. Hydrogen can form compounds with most elements and is present in water and most organic compounds.
*Helium (He) exists only as a gas except in extreme conditions. It is the second-lightest element and is the second-most abundant in the universe. Most helium was formed during the Big Bang, but new helium is created through nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars. On Earth, helium is relatively rare, only occurring as a byproduct of the natural decay of some radioactive elements. Such &#x27;radiogenic&#x27; helium is trapped within natural gas in concentrations of up to seven percent by volume.

===Period 2===
Period 2 elements involve the 2s and 2p orbitals. They include the biologically most essential elements besides hydrogen: carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.
*Lithium (Li) is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element. In its non-ionized state it is one of the most reactive elements, and so is only ever found naturally in compounds. It is the heaviest primordial element forged in large quantities during the Big Bang. 
*Beryllium (Be) has one of the highest melting points of all the light metals. Small amounts of beryllium were synthesised during the Big Bang, although most of it decayed or reacted further within stars to create larger nuclei, like carbon, nitrogen or oxygen. Beryllium is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a group 1 carcinogen. Between 1% and 15% of people are sensitive to beryllium and may develop an inflammatory reaction in their respiratory system and skin, called chronic beryllium disease.
*Boron (B) does not occur naturally as a free element, but in compounds such as borates. It is an essential plant micronutrient, required for cell wall strength and development, cell division, seed and fruit development, sugar transport and hormone development, though high levels are toxic.
*Carbon (C) is the fourth-most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium and oxygen and is the second-most abundant element in the human body by mass after oxygen, the third-most abundant by number of atoms. There are an almost infinite number of compounds that contain carbon due to carbon&#x27;s ability to form long stable chains of C—C bonds. All organic compounds, those essential for life, contain at least one atom of carbon; combined with hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus, carbon is the basis of every important biological compound.
*Nitrogen (N) is found mainly as mostly inert diatomic gas, N2, which makes up 78% of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere by volume. It is an essential component of proteins and therefore of life.
*Oxygen (O) comprising 21% of the atmosphere by volume and is required for respiration by all (or nearly all) animals, as well as being the principal component of water. Oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, and oxygen compounds dominate the Earth&#x27;s crust.
*Fluorine (F) is the most reactive element in its non-ionized state, and so is never found that way in nature.
*Neon (Ne) is a noble gas used in neon lighting.

===Period 3===

All period three elements occur in nature and have at least one stable isotope. All but the noble gas argon are essential to basic geology and biology.
*Sodium (Na) is an alkali metal. It is present in Earth&#x27;s oceans in large quantities in the form of sodium chloride (table salt).
*Magnesium (Mg) is an alkaline earth metal. Magnesium ions are found in chlorophyll.
*Aluminium (Al) is a post-transition metal. It is the most abundant metal in the Earth&#x27;s crust.
*Silicon (Si) is a metalloid. It is a semiconductor, making it the principal component in many integrated circuits. Silicon dioxide is the principal constituent of sand. As Carbon is to Biology, Silicon is to Geology.
*Phosphorus (P) is a nonmetal essential to DNA. It is highly reactive, and as such is never found in nature as a free element.
*Sulfur (S) is a nonmetal. It is found in two amino acids: cysteine and methionine.
*Chlorine (Cl) is a halogen. Since it is one of the most reactive elements, it is often found on the Earth&#x27;s surface as sodium chloride. Its compounds used as a disinfectant, especially in swimming pools.
*Argon (Ar) is a noble gas, making it almost entirely nonreactive. Incandescent lamps are often filled with noble gases such as argon in order to preserve the filaments at high temperatures.

===Period 4===


Period 4 includes the biologically essential elements potassium and calcium, and is the first period in the d-block with the lighter transition metals. These include iron, the heaviest element forged in main-sequence stars and a principal component of the Earth, as well as other important metals such as cobalt, nickel, and copper. Almost all have biological roles.

Completing the fourth period are six p-block elements: gallium, germanium, arsenic, selenium, bromine, and krypton.

===Period 5===

Period 5 has the same number of elements as period 4 and follows the same general structure but with one more post transition metal and one fewer nonmetal. Of the three heaviest elements with biological roles, two (molybdenum and iodine) are in this period; tungsten, in period 6, is heavier, along with several of the early lanthanides. Period 5 also includes technetium, the lightest exclusively radioactive element.

===Period 6===
Period 6 is the first period to include the f-block, with the lanthanides (also known as the rare earth elements), and includes the heaviest stable elements. Many of these heavy metals are toxic and some are radioactive, but platinum and gold are largely inert.

===Period 7===
All elements of period 7 are radioactive. This period contains the heaviest element which occurs naturally on Earth, plutonium. All of the subsequent elements in the period have been synthesized artificially. Whilst five of these (from americium to einsteinium) are now available in macroscopic quantities, most are extremely rare, having only been prepared in microgram amounts or less. Some of the later elements have only ever been identified in laboratories in quantities of a few atoms at a time.

Although the rarity of many of these elements means that experimental results are not very extensive, periodic and group trends in behaviour appear to be less well defined for period 7 than for other periods. Whilst francium and radium do show typical properties of groups 1 and 2, respectively, the actinides display a much greater variety of behaviour and oxidation states than the lanthanides. These peculiarities of period 7 may be due to a variety of factors, including a large degree of spin–orbit coupling and relativistic effects, ultimately caused by the very high positive electrical charge from their massive atomic nuclei.

===Period 8===

No element of the eighth period has yet been synthesized. A g-block is predicted. It is not clear if all elements predicted for the eighth period are in fact physically possible. Therefore, there may not be a ninth period.

<text>The Exorcist is a 1971 horror novel written by American writer William Peter Blatty and published by Harper &amp; Row. The book details the demonic possession of eleven-year-old Regan MacNeil, the daughter of a famous actress, and the two priests who attempt to exorcise the demon. The novel was the basis of a highly successful Oscar-winning film adaptation released two years later, whose screenplay was also written and produced by Blatty, for which he won an Academy Award. More movies and books were eventually added to &quot;The Exorcist&quot; franchise.

The novel was inspired by a 1949 case of supposed demonic possession and exorcism that Blatty heard about while he was a student in the class of 1950 at Georgetown University. As a result, the novel takes place in Washington, D.C., near the campus of Georgetown University. In September 2011, the novel was reprinted by HarperCollins to celebrate its 40th anniversary, with slight revisions made by Blatty as well as interior title artwork by Jeremy Caniglia.

==Plot==
An elderly Jesuit priest named Father Lankester Merrin is leading an archaeological dig in northern Iraq and is studying ancient relics. After discovering a small statue of the demon Pazuzu (an actual ancient Assyrian demon), a series of omens alerts him to a pending confrontation with a powerful evil, which, unknown to the reader at this point, he has battled before in an exorcism in Africa.

Meanwhile, in Georgetown, a young girl named Regan MacNeil is living with her famous mother, actress Chris MacNeil, who is in Georgetown filming a movie. Chris has rented a house for her and Regan to reside in during the filming. Regan finds a Ouija board in the basement of the home, which she uses to communicate with an entity who identifies itself as &quot;Captain Howdy&quot;. As Chris finishes her work on the film, Regan begins to become inexplicably ill. After a gradual series of poltergeist-like disturbances in their rented house, for which Chris attempts to find rational explanations, Regan begins to rapidly undergo disturbing psychological and physical changes: she refuses to eat or sleep, becomes withdrawn, and increasingly aggressive and violent. Regan contorts her body to bow and bend in impossible directions, at one point following around her tutor Sharon, hissing and squirming like a snake. Chris initially mistakes Regan&#x27;s behavior for the result of repressed anger over her parents&#x27; divorce and absent father.

Coupled with these events are disturbances at the local Holy Trinity Church, which has been desecrated on several recent occasions. Detective Kinderman begins investigating Father Karras, as they exchange disturbing stories of black mass Catholic theology and 1960s film stars. At this point in the novel Burke Dennings has been killed, with his head turned completely around.
&quot;Could another human being have done it? Yes, but he&#x27;d have to be an exceptionally powerful man.&quot;

After several unsuccessful psychiatric and medical treatments (X-rays, medication, temporal lobe analysis) Regan&#x27;s mother, an atheist, turns to a local Jesuit priest for help as Regan&#x27;s personality becomes increasingly disturbed and the doctors still cannot find a source. Father Damien Karras, who is currently going through a crisis of faith coupled with the recent loss of his mother, agrees to see Regan as a psychiatrist, but initially resists the notion that it is an actual demonic possession, pointing to advances in science which can explain what was previously assumed to be possession. After a few meetings with the child, now completely inhabited by a diabolical personality claiming to be the devil, he turns to the local bishop for permission to perform an exorcism on the child.

The bishop with whom he consults does not believe Karras is qualified to perform the rites, and appoints the experienced Merrin—who has recently returned to the United States—to perform the exorcism, although he does allow the doubt-ridden Karras to assist him. The lengthy exorcism tests the priests both physically and spiritually. When Merrin, who had previously suffered cardiac arrhythmia, dies during the process, completion of the exorcism ultimately falls upon Father Karras. When he demands that the demonic spirit inhabit him instead of the innocent Regan, the demon seizes the opportunity to possess the priest. Karras heroically surrenders his own life in exchange for Regan&#x27;s by jumping out of her bedroom window and dies, regaining his faith in God as his last rites are read.

==Writing==

Blatty had considered writing a novel based on the Doe exorcism since he had written about it as a college student, even as he became successful as a comic novelist and screenwriter in the early 1960s, but his agent talked him out of doing so when he raised the subject. But after seeing the film version of Ira Levin&#x27;s &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; in 1968, Blatty told his wife that he wanted to write a story like that. He liked the way director Roman Polanski had kept the audience unsure whether the title character&#x27;s concerns for her unborn child were genuine or not, but felt the ending was &quot;schlocky&quot;, reducing the Devil to a joke.

Blatty believed he could improve on the ending of &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, making the spiritual struggle a more central theme of the story. After he pitched the story to an editor at Bantam Books at a cocktail party, he received a $25,000 advance ($ in ) and began writing at his home in Encino, California, taking stimulants to write for 16 hours a day and finish the novel in the expected 10 months. As he wrote, the story, which Blatty originally envisioned taking place largely in a courtroom, instead moved to the locations of the events recounted and become darker, with the possessed Regan masturbating with a crucifix and screaming obscene words at the priests trying to cast the demon out, all to make the evil more uniformly repulsive to readers.

==Inspirations==
Aspects of the Father Merrin character were based on the British archaeologist Gerald Lankester Harding, who had excavated the caves where the Dead Sea Scrolls had been found and whom Blatty had met in Beirut. Blatty has stated that Harding &quot;was the physical model in my mind when I created the character [of Merrin], whose first name, please note, is Lankester&quot;. Another inspiration was the Jesuit theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a trained archeologist who worked on several notable digs.

Aspects of the novel were inspired by an exorcism performed by the Jesuit priest, Fr. William S. Bowdern, who formerly taught at both St. Louis University and St. Louis University High School. Recent investigative research by freelance journalist Mark Opsasnick indicates that this was the real 1949 exorcism of a young boy from Cottage City, Maryland, whom Opsasnick refers to using the pseudonyms Robbie Mannheim and Roland Doe. The boy was sent to his relative&#x27;s home on Roanoke Drive in St. Louis where most of the exorcism took place. However, according to the journalist: &quot;There is simply too much evidence that indicates that as a boy he [Roland Doe] had serious emotional problems stemming from his home life. There is not one shred of hard evidence to support the notion of demonic possession&quot;.

Blatty refers to the Loudun possessions and the Louviers possessions throughout the story, mostly when Fr. Karras is researching possession and exorcism to present the case to his superiors. He also has one of his characters tell a brief story about an unnamed fraudulent medium who had studied to be a Jesuit priest. This story can be found in &quot;Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research&quot;, Vol. 114. 1930, in an article about fraudulent practices by Daniel Dunglas Home.

It has been speculated that Shirley McLaine, a former neighbor of the Blattys in California, may have been the basis for the Chris MacNeil character. The last name is similar; &quot;Neil&quot; may be an anagram of &quot;Laine.&quot; Another correspondence between life and art: at the time Blatty knew MacLaine, she, like Chris MacNeil, had a married European couple as household staff. In addition, Blatty incorporated quotes from McLaine into the novel&#x27;s dialogue.

==Achievements==
According to research from the Spanish Book Institute, the Spanish-translated version was the eighth-most popular book sold in Spain in 1975.

==Editions==
Cemetery Dance published a special omnibus edition of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and its sequel &quot;Legion&quot; in October 2010, signed by Blatty (). A limited edition of 750 copies (with an additional 52 leatherbound copies), it is now out of print. In September 2011, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was re-released as a 40th Anniversary Edition in paperback, hardcover and audiobook editions with differing cover artwork. This new, updated edition featured and revised material, as Blatty writes: &quot;The 40th Anniversary Edition of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; will have a touch of new material in it as part of an all-around polish of the dialogue and prose. It also features all new cover artwork and interiors by the artist Jeremy Caniglia. First time around I never had the time (meaning the funds) to do a second draft, and this, finally, is it. With forty years to think about it, a few little changes were inevitable — plus one new character in a totally new, very spooky scene. This is the version I would like to be remembered for&quot;.

===Translations===
The novel was translated into many languages including Spanish and Bengali. The Bengali translation was done by the late popular Bangladeshi novelist and screenwriter Humayun Ahmed.

==Adaptations==
In 1973, the novel was adapted by Blatty for the film of the same name and directed by William Friedkin with Ellen Burstyn, Max von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb, Jack MacGowran, Jason Miller and Linda Blair. The screenplay for the film won Blatty an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. In 1974 famed Japanese horror author Kazuo Umezu also created a short comic adaptation of this film.

In February 2014, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a two-part adaptation of the novel by Robert Forrest produced and directed by Gaynor MacFarlane and
starring Robert Glenister as Father Karras, Lydia Wilson as Regan, Teresa Gallagher as Chris MacNeil, Karl Johnson as Detective Kinderman, Bryan Dick as Father Dyer, Alexandra Mathie as The Demon and Ian McDiarmid as Father Merrin.

A stage adaptation of the novel was written by John Pielmeier and premiered at Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles in July 2012. It was directed by John Doyle and starred Brooke Shields, David Wilson Barnes, Richard Chamberlain, Emily Yetter, Harry Groener, Roslyn Ruff, Manoel Felciano, Tom Nelis, and Stephen Bogardus. The play made its UK premiere at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in October 2016, co-produced by Bill Kenwright. The new production was directed by Sean Mathias, designed by Anna Fleischle and starred Jenny Seagrove as Chris, Peter Bowles as Merrin and Adam Garcia as Damien.

<text>Survival International is a human rights organisation formed in 1969, a London based charity that campaigns for the collective rights of Indigenous, tribal and uncontacted peoples.

The organisation&#x27;s campaigns generally focus on tribal peoples&#x27; desires to keep their ancestral lands. Survival International calls these peoples socially vulnerable, and aims to eradicate what it calls &#x27;misconceptions&#x27; used to justify violations of human rights. It also aims to publicize harm caused to tribes by corporations and governments. Survival International states that it aims to help foster tribal people&#x27;s self-determination.

Survival International is in association with the United Nations Department of Global Communications and in consultative status with the UN Economic and Social Council. To ensure freedom of action, Survival accepts no government funding. It is a founding member and a signatory organization of the &quot;Accountability Charter&quot; (INGO Accountability Charter). Survival has offices in Amsterdam, Berlin, London, Madrid, Milan, Paris, and San Francisco.

==History==

Survival International was founded in 1969 (as the &quot;Primitive Peoples Fund&quot;) after an article by Norman Lewis in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Magazine highlighted the massacres, land thefts and genocide taking place in Brazilian Amazonia. In 1971, the fledgling organisation visited Brazil to observe the Fundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI) government agency responsible for tribal peoples there. After a name change, Survival International incorporated as an English company in 1972 and registered as a charity in 1974. According to the autobiography of its first chairman, the explorer Robin Hanbury-Tenison, while travelling with the ethnobotanist Conrad Gorinsky in the Amazon in 1968,
It was the first in this field to use mass letter-writing, having orchestrated several campaigns in many different places throughout the world, such as Siberia, Canada, and Kenya. Several campaigns were able to bring change to government policies regarding the rights of local Indigenous people. In 2000, this form of struggle was successful in driving the Indian government to abandon their plan to relocate the isolated Jarawa tribe, after receiving 150-200 letters a day from Survival supporters around the world. Shortly before that, the governor of western Siberia imposed a five-year ban on all oil licences in the territory of the Yugan Khanty within weeks of Survival issuing a bulletin. Survival was also the first organisation to draw attention to the destructive effects of World Bank projects – now recognised as a major cause of suffering in many poor countries.

Survival is the only international pro-tribal peoples organisation to have received the Right Livelihood Award, as well as the Spanish &quot;Premio Léon Felipe&quot; and the Italian &quot;Medaglia della Presidenza della Camera dei Deputati&quot;.

==Structure and aims==
Survival International works for tribal peoples&#x27; rights on three complementary levels: education, advocacy and campaigns. It also offers tribal people a platform to address the world, while connecting with local Indigenous organisations, with focus on tribal peoples under more urgent threat from contact with the outside world. The educational programs are aimed at people in the Western world, aiming at &quot;demolishing the myth that tribal people are relics, destined to perish through &#x27;progress&#x27;&quot;. Survival seeks to promote respect for their cultures and explain their relevance today in preserving their way of life.

Survival has supporters in 82 countries. Its materials are published in many languages throughout the world. It is a registered charity in the United Kingdom and the equivalent in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the United States, and can receive tax-free donations in the Netherlands.

Survival refuses government funding, depending exclusively on public support, in order to ensure freedom of action. All the people sent into the field belong to Survival International staff, none are sponsored volunteers or visitors of any kind. Overseas projects are carried and managed by tribes themselves.

==Tribes==
There are more than 150 million tribal people worldwide, including at least 100 uncontacted peoples in 60 countries. Survival International supports these endangered tribes on a global level, with campaigns established in America, Africa and Asia. Most of them have been persecuted and face genocide by diseases, relocation from their homes by logging and mining, and eviction by settlers. 

Survival believes that Indigenous rights to land ownership, although recognised by international law, are not effectively respected, with tribes being invaded by activities such as oil and mineral mining, logging, cattle ranching, private or government &quot;development&quot; schemes such as building of roads and dams, or for nature reserves and game parks. Beyond these economic causes for exploitive invasions, Survival highlights ignorance and racism that sees tribal peoples as backward and primitive. Survival believes that in the long-term, public opinion is the most effective force for change.

The impact of the outside world on the existence of Indigenous peoples and their cultures is described as being very dramatic. In Siberia, only 10% of the tribal peoples live a nomadic or semi-nomadic life, compared to 70% 30 years ago. In Brazil – where Survival believes most of the world&#x27;s uncontacted tribes, probably more than 50, live – there are about 400 speakers for 110 languages. For authors such as Daniel Everett, this phenomenon represents a fundamental assault on the existence of peoples, as language expresses the way a group of people experience reality in a unique way, and it is a part of our common heritage. Ranka Bjeljac-Babic, lecturer and specialist in the psychology of language, describes an intrinsic and causal link between the threat of biological diversity and cultural diversity. The assault on Indigenous customs and traditions is described as part of a larger assault on life, with its historical roots in colonization. Survival&#x27;s report &quot;Progress can Kill&quot; highlights that the invasion of the Americas and Australia by Europeans eliminated 90% of the Indigenous population on these continents. The threat of genocide continues.

Most fundamentally, Survival believes that it is the respect for the right to keep their land that may allow them to survive. The issues of human rights and freedom depend on the land on which they can subsist and develop according to their own culture. Interference with this basic need endangers their capacity to live sustainably.

In January 2019, the newly elected president of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro stripped the Indigenous affairs agency FUNAI of the responsibility to identify and demarcate Indigenous lands. He argued that those territories have very tiny isolated populations and proposed to integrate them into the larger Brazilian society. According to the Survival International, &quot;Taking responsibility for Indigenous land demarcation away from FUNAI, the Indian affairs department, and giving it to the Agriculture Ministry is virtually a declaration of open warfare against Brazil&#x27;s tribal peoples.&quot;

==Campaigns==
Survival International campaigns for the uncontacted tribes in the territory of Peru, many unidentified Indigenous people in Brazil, Russia, West Papua, and about 30 tribes in several countries in South America, Africa, and Asia. They select their cases based on a criterion the organisation has established, which depends on a wide range of factors, such as the reliability and continuity of the information, the gravity of the situation the tribe in question is facing, the degree to which they believe their work can make a real difference, the degree to which improvements in this area would have a knock on effect for others, whether any other organisation is already working on the case, and whether they are sure of what the people themselves want.

A common threat to the tribes for which Survival campaigns is the invasion of their lands for exploration of resources. This invariably leads to forced relocation, loss of sustainability and forced changes in their way of living. Usually, this is accompanied by diseases from the contact with the outsiders for which they have an unprepared immune system – this threat alone can wipe out entire tribes. Logging and/or cattle ranchers have affected most of these tribes, from South America, Africa, to Australasia. The Arhuaco, in Colombia, have drug plantations, associated with crossfire from guerilla wars between cartel and government interests. The Ogiek, in Kenya, have tea plantations, and the Amungme in Indonesia, the San in Botswana, the Dongria Kondh in India, and the Palawan in the Philippines have mining fields.

Survival international has also pointed out in their campaigns against the assault on their way of living the effect of the work of missionaries. The Arhuaco, Ayoreo, Aborigines, the Innu, and several tribes in West Papua have all suffered direct attacks on their culture from what, in the perspective of Survival, may constitute good intention, but nevertheless is destructive to their lives. The children of the Khanty and Wanniyala-Aetto have been kidnapped to be raised in foreign religions and culture. In the long run, these practices are successful in assimilating and destroying a group of people.

Besides suffering the genocide brought about through disease and hunger (which is the result of losing their natural environment and having fertile soil stolen from them), Survival says some tribes have suffered campaigns of direct assassination. Most tribes in South America, such as the Awá, Akuntsu, Guaraní, and the Yanomami, have been murdered on sight by multinational workers, ranchers and gunmen for hire, while tribes in Africa and Asia have suffered waves of murder at the hands of the government. Survival International has pointed to the tribe Akuntsu, of which only five members still remain, as an example of what this threat represents: the eventual genocide of a whole people.

Survival International has called attention to the rise in suicide in tribal peoples such as the Innu, Australian Aborigines, and the Guarani, as a consequence of outside interference with the tribes&#x27; cultures and direct persecution. Suffering from the trauma of forced relocation, many tribal people find themselves in despair living in an environment they are not used to, where there is nothing useful to do, and where they are treated with racist disdain by their new neighbours. Other social consequences from this displacement have been pointed out to alcoholism and violence, with campaigns reporting the cases of the Innu, Mursi, Bodi, Konso, and Wanniyala-Aetto. Tribal peoples are also more vulnerable to sexual exploitation. Among the tribes with whom Survival International has campaigned, there has been reported rapes of girls and women by workers of invading companies in the Indigenous tribes of Penan, West Papuan tribes, Jummas, and Jarawa.

The government role in these territories varies. Most Brazilian tribes are protected under law, while in reality there has been resistance in policies and strong support for enterprises that carry out these threats on their existence. In Africa, the San tribes and other tribes have been persecuted with beating and torture to force relocation, as well as murder in the Nuba, and in the Bangladesh, Asia, with the Jummas. Sometimes governments offer compensations that are believed by Survival to be unwanted alternatives for the tribes, portrayed as &quot;development&quot;.

In April 2012, Survival International launched a worldwide campaign, backed by actor Colin Firth, to protect the Awa-Guajá people of Brazil, which the organization considers to be the &quot;earth&#x27;s most threatened tribe&quot;.

In late 2015, Survival International started the Stop the Con campaign, which seeks to raise awareness about negative impacts of traditional conservation policies on tribal peoples. This campaign is part of Survival International&#x27;s larger campaign on conservation.

==Media attention==
Survival International has received attention in the media over the years with the campaigns and work of volunteer supporters. Celebrity endorsements include Richard Gere, who has spoken up for the Jumma of Bangladesh, Julie Christie, who gave a Radio 4 appeal on behalf of the Khanty of Siberia, Judi Dench, who warned of the events surrounding the Arhuaco of Colombia, and Colin Firth, who spoke out against the eviction of the San tribe, and in favour of the Awa-Guajá people.

However, the media have not always been sympathetic towards the organisation. In 1995, the Independent Television Commission banned one of Survival International&#x27;s advertisements, citing the Broadcasting Act 1990, which states that organisations cannot advertise their work if it is wholly or mainly of a political nature. The ad was broadcast on the music cable channel The Box and the MTV satellite offshoot VH-1. It featured Richard Gere urging viewers to help to stop the slaughter and exploitation of tribal people.

Another controversy ensued after an article in &quot;The Observer&quot; cast doubt on Survival International&#x27;s reporting of an uncontacted tribe in Peru, which included a picture with tribesmen firing arrows up at an aircraft. After a heated confrontation that dragged for a couple of months, with threats of taking Survival International to court for libel, &quot;The Observer&quot; ended up conceding in August 2008 that it had got the story wrong. In a clarification, the newspaper stated: &quot;While &quot;The Observer&quot; cannot be responsible for content of other media it does have a duty under the Editors&#x27; Code not to publish &#x27;inaccurate, misleading or distorted information&#x27;. It failed in that duty here.&quot;

The Government of Botswana, with whom Survival International has had a long-standing disagreement over the government&#x27;s treatment of the San people in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, has complained about uneven coverage in the mainstream media. The San have challenged the government in court several times regarding their right to remain on their land without interference. Ian Khama, President of Botswana, stated that Survival International is &quot;denying them and especially their children opportunities to grow with the mainstream&quot;, forcing Indigenous peoples into maintaining &quot;a very backward form of life&quot;. It has been alleged that the Botswana government &quot;has instructed all departmental heads in the state media to ensure that any negative reporting on the controversial relocations from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR) should be contrasted strongly with freshly-sought government statements.&quot; 

In May 2013, Survival International accused the government of plans to evict San from their homes in Ranyane. Government representative Jeff Ramsay denied this allegation and described Survival International as a &quot;neo-Apartheid organisation&quot;. Survival International subsequently reported that on May 28, Botswana&#x27;s High Court had ruled that the eviction be suspended until mid-June. A Survival International campaigner was quoted as saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how the government can say there is no case, and that they are not planning to evict them when the Ranyane Bushmen are taking the government to court to stop from being removed.&quot; The director of Khwedom Council, Keibakile Mogodu, said, &quot;We have been deliberating on the issue with government officials, yes I can confirm that government was due to relocate [six hundred] Basarwa on Monday, [May 27th].&quot; A case has been filed on the San&#x27;s behalf.

In 2005, Survival published the book &quot;There You Go!&quot; (Oren Ginzburg), which depicted a tribal society being harmed by development. In the book&#x27;s foreword, Stephen Corry wrote: &quot;The &#x27;development&#x27; of tribal peoples against their wishes – really to let others get their land and resources – is rooted in 19th century colonialism (&#x27;We know best&#x27;) dressed up in 20th century &#x27;political correct&#x27; euphemism. Tribal peoples are not backward: they are independent and vibrant societies which, like all of us always, are constantly adapting to a changing world. The main difference between tribal peoples and us is that we take their land and resources, and believe the dishonest, even racist, claim that it&#x27;s for their own good. It&#x27;s conquest, not development. If you really want to understand what&#x27;s going on, read this book.&quot;

Survival International encourages supporters to use multiple media to spread awareness on Indigenous rights issues. In the guide &quot;Walk Your Talk&quot;, the organisation gives tips on a variety of actions, from writing letters to governments, to spreading the word through sponsorships, leaflets, demonstrations, film shows, and collecting money from a variety of events.

<text>A swamp is a forested wetland. Swamps are considered to be transition zones because both land and water play a role in creating this environment. Swamps vary in size and are located all around the world. The water of a swamp may be fresh water, brackish water, or seawater. Freshwater swamps form along large rivers or lakes where they are critically dependent upon rainwater and seasonal flooding to maintain natural water level fluctuations. Saltwater swamps are found along tropical and subtropical coastlines. Some swamps have hammocks, or dry-land protrusions, covered by aquatic vegetation, or vegetation that tolerates periodic inundation or soil saturation. The two main types of swamp are &quot;true&quot; or swamp forests and &quot;transitional&quot; or shrub swamps. In the boreal regions of Canada, the word swamp is colloquially used for what is more formally termed a bog, fen, or muskeg. Some of the world&#x27;s largest swamps are found along major rivers such as the Amazon, the Mississippi, and the Congo.

==Differences between marshes and swamps==
Swamps and marshes are specific types of wetlands that form along waterbodies containing rich, hydric soils. Marshes are wetlands, continually or frequently flooded by nearby running bodies of water, that are dominated by emergent soft-stem vegetation and herbaceous plants. Swamps are wetlands consisting of saturated soils or standing water and are dominated by water-tolerant woody vegetation such as shrubs, bushes, and trees.

==Hydrology==
Swamps are characterized by their saturated soils and slow-moving waters. The water that accumulates in swamps comes from a variety of sources including precipitation, groundwater, tides and/or freshwater flooding. These hydrologic pathways all contribute to how energy and nutrients flow in and out of the ecosystem. As water flows through the swamp, nutrients, sediment and pollutants are naturally filtered out. Chemicals like phosphorus and nitrogen that end up in waterways get absorbed and used by the aquatic plants within the swamp, purifying the water. Any remaining or excess chemicals present will accumulate at the bottom of the swamp, being removed from the water and buried within the sediment. The hydrology of a swamp is a key factor in its biogeochemical environment, which includes the levels and availability of resources like oxygen, nutrients, pH, and toxicity.

==Values and ecosystem services==

Swamps and other wetlands have traditionally held a very low property value compared to fields, prairies, or woodlands. They have a reputation for being unproductive land that cannot easily be utilized for human activities, other than hunting, trapping, or fishing. Farmers, for example, typically drained swamps next to their fields so as to gain more land usable for planting crops, both historically, and to a lesser extent, presently. On the other hand, swamps can (and do) play a beneficial ecological role in the overall functions of the natural environment and provide a variety of resources that many species depend on. Swamps and other wetlands have shown to be a natural form of flood management and defense against flooding. In such circumstances where flooding does occur, swamps absorb and use the excess water within the wetland, preventing it from traveling and flooding surrounding areas. Dense vegetation within the swamp also provides soil stability to the land, holding soils and sediment in place whilst preventing erosion and land loss. Swamps are an abundant and valuable source of fresh water and oxygen for all life, and they are often breeding grounds for a wide variety of species. Floodplain swamps are an important resource in the production and distribution of fish. Two thirds of global fish and shellfish are commercially harvested and dependent on wetlands.

==Impacts and conservation==
Historically, humans have been known to drain and/or fill swamps and other wetlands in order to create more space for human development and to reduce the threat of diseases borne by swamp insects. Wetlands are removed and replaced with land that is then used for things like agriculture, real estate, and recreational uses. Many swamps have also undergone intensive logging and farming, requiring the construction of drainage ditches and canals. These ditches and canals contributed to drainage and, along the coast, allowed salt water to intrude, converting swamps to marsh or even to open water. Large areas of swamp were therefore lost or degraded. Louisiana provides a classic example of wetland loss from these combined factors. Europe has likely lost nearly half its wetlands. New Zealand lost 90 percent of its wetlands over a period of 150 years. Ecologists recognize that swamps provide ecological services including flood control, fish production, water purification, carbon storage, and wildlife habitats. In many parts of the world authorities protect swamps. In parts of Europe and North America, swamp restoration projects are becoming widespread. The United States government began enforcing stricter laws and management programs in the 1970s in efforts to protect and restore these ecosystems. Often the simplest steps to restoring swamps involve plugging drainage ditches and removing levees.

Conservationists work to preserve swamps such as those in northwest Indiana in the United States Midwest that were preserved as part of the Indiana Dunes.

==Notable examples==
Swamps can be found on all continents except Antarctica.

The largest swamp in the world is the Amazon River floodplain, which is particularly significant for its large number of fish and tree species.

===Africa===
The Sudd and the Okavango Delta are Africa&#x27;s best known marshland areas. The Bangweulu Floodplains make up Africa&#x27;s largest swamp.

===Asia===

The Mesopotamian Marshes is a large swamp and river system in southern Iraq, traditionally inhabited in part by the Marsh Arabs.

In Asia, tropical peat swamps are located in mainland East Asia and Southeast Asia. In Southeast Asia, peatlands are mainly found in low altitude coastal and sub-coastal areas and extend inland for distance more than along river valleys and across watersheds. They are mostly to be found on the coasts of East Sumatra, Kalimantan (Central, East, South and West Kalimantan provinces), West Papua, Papua New Guinea, Brunei, Peninsular Malaya, Sabah, Sarawak, Southeast Thailand, and the Philippines (Riley &quot;et al.&quot;,1996). Indonesia has the largest area of tropical peatland. Of the total tropical peat swamp, about are located in Indonesia (Page, 2001; Wahyunto, 2006).

The Vasyugan Swamp is a large swamp in the western Siberia area of the Russian Federation. This is one of the largest swamps in the world, covering an area larger than Switzerland.

===North America===

The Atchafalaya Swamp at the lower end of the Mississippi River is the largest swamp in the United States. It is an important example of the southern cypress swamp but it has been greatly altered by logging, drainage, and levee construction. Other famous swamps in the United States are the forested portions of the Everglades, Okefenokee Swamp, Barley Barber Swamp, Great Cypress Swamp and the Great Dismal Swamp. The Okefenokee is located in extreme southeastern Georgia and extends slightly into northeastern Florida. The Great Cypress Swamp is mostly in Delaware, but extends into Maryland on the Delmarva Peninsula. Point Lookout State Park on the southern tip of Maryland contains many swamps and marshes. The Great Dismal Swamp lies in extreme southeastern Virginia and extreme northeastern North Carolina. Both are National Wildlife Refuges. Another swamp area, Reelfoot Lake of extreme western Tennessee and Kentucky, was created by the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes. Caddo Lake, the Great Dismal and Reelfoot are swamps centered at large lakes. Swamps are often associated with &quot;bayous&quot; in the southeastern United States, especially in the Gulf Coast region. A baygall is a type of swamp found in the forest of the Gulf Coast states in the USA.

==List of major swamps==

<text>Liturgy is the customary public ritual of worship performed by a religious group. As a religious phenomenon, liturgy represents a communal response to and participation in the sacred through activities reflecting praise, thanksgiving, remembrance, supplication, or repentance. It forms a basis for establishing a relationship with God.

Technically speaking, liturgy forms a subset of ritual. The word &quot;liturgy&quot;, sometimes equated in English as &quot;&quot;, refers to a formal ritual enacted by those who understand themselves to be participating in an action with the divine.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;liturgy&quot; (), derived from the technical term in ancient Greek (), &quot;leitourgia&quot;, which means &quot;work or service for the people&quot; is a literal translation of the two affixes λήϊτος, &quot;leitos&quot;, derived from the Attic form of λαός (&quot;people, public&quot;), and ἔργον, &quot;ergon&quot;, meaning &quot;work, service&quot;. 

In origin, it signified the often expensive offerings wealthy Greeks made in service to the people, and thus to the &quot;polis&quot; and the state. Through the &quot;leitourgia&quot;, the rich carried a financial burden and were correspondingly rewarded with honours and prestige. Specific &quot;leitourgia&quot; were assigned by the &quot;polis&quot;, the State, and during Rome&#x27;s domination, the Roman Imperial authorities as &quot;gifts&quot; to the state and the people. Their performance became obligatory in the course of the 3rd century AD, as a form of taxation. The holder of a Hellenic &quot;leitourgia&quot; was not taxed a specific sum, but was assigned to subsidise a particular ritual, which could be performed with greater or lesser generosity or magnificence. The chief sphere remained that of civic religion, embodied in the festivals: M.I. Finley notes &quot;in Demosthenes&#x27; day there were at least 97 liturgical appointments in Athens for the festivals, rising to 118 in a (quadrennial) Panathenaic year.&quot; Groups of rich citizens were assigned to subsidise civic amenities and even warships. Eventually, under the Roman Empire, such obligations, known to Romans as &quot;munera&quot;, devolved into a competitive and ruinously expensive burden that was avoided when possible. &quot;Munera&quot; included a wide range of expenses having to do with civic infrastructure and amenities; festivals and games (&quot;ludi&quot;) and imperial obligations such as highway, bridge and aqueduct repair, supply of various raw materials, and feeding troops in transit.

==Buddhism==
Buddhist liturgy is a formalized service of veneration and worship performed within a Buddhist Sangha in nearly every traditional denomination and sect in the Buddhist world. It is often done one or more times a day and can vary among the Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana sects.

The liturgy mainly consists of chanting or reciting a &quot;sutra&quot; or passages from a &quot;sutras&quot;, a &quot;mantra&quot; (especially in Vajrayana), and several &quot;gathas&quot;. Depending on what practice the practitioner wishes to undertake, it can be done at a temple or at home. The liturgy is almost always performed in front of an object or objects of veneration and accompanied by offerings of light, incense, water, and food.

==Christianity==

Frequently in Christianity, a distinction is made between &quot;liturgical&quot; and &quot;non-liturgical&quot; churches based on how elaborate or formal the worship; in this usage, churches whose services are unscripted or improvised are called &quot;non-liturgical&quot;. Others object to this distinction, arguing that this terminology obscures the universality of public worship as a religious phenomenon. Thus, even the &quot;open&quot; or &quot;waiting&quot; worship of Quakers is liturgical, since the waiting itself until the Holy Spirit moves individuals to speak is a prescribed form of Quaker worship, sometimes referred to as &quot;the liturgy of silence&quot;. Typically in Christianity, however, the term &quot;the liturgy&quot; normally refers to a standardised order of events observed during a religious service, be it a sacramental service or a service of public prayer; usually the former is the referent. In the ancient tradition, sacramental liturgy especially is the participation of the people in the work of God, which is primarily the saving work of Jesus Christ; in this liturgy, Christ continues the work of redemption.

The term &quot;liturgy&quot; in Greek literally means to &quot;work for the people&quot;, but a better translation is &quot;public service&quot; or &quot;public work&quot;, as made clear from the origin of the term as described above. The early Christians adopted the word to describe their principal act of worship, the Sunday service (referred to by various terms, including Holy Eucharist, Holy Communion, Mass or Divine Liturgy), which they considered to be a sacrifice. This service, liturgy, or ministry (from the Latin &quot;ministerium&quot;) is a duty for Christians as a priestly people by their baptism into Christ and participation in His high priestly ministry. It is also God&#x27;s ministry or service to the worshippers. It is a reciprocal service. Historically, there was a Christian thought that stresses the idea of the entire liturgy being needed to transform the bread and wine into Eucharistic elements (see Eucharist). This may have been prevalent especially in Egypt. Usually, many Christian churches designate one person who participates in the worship service as the liturgist. The liturgist may read announcements, scriptures, and calls to worship, while the minister preaches the sermon, offers prayers, and blesses sacraments. The liturgist may be either an ordained minister or a lay person. The entire congregation participates in and offers the liturgy to God.

==Islam==

&quot;Salāt&quot; (&quot;prayer&quot;, &#x27; or : &#x27;; pl. &quot;&quot;) is the practice of physical and compulsory prayer in Islam as opposed to dua, which is the Arabic word for supplication. Its importance for Muslims is indicated by its status as one of the Five Pillars of Islam.

Salat is preceded by ritual ablution and usually performed five times a day. It consists of the repetition of a unit called a &quot;rakʿah&quot; (pl. &quot;rakaʿāt&quot;) consisting of prescribed actions and words. The number of obligatory (&quot;fard&quot;) &quot;rakaʿāt&quot; varies from two to four according to the time of day or other circumstances (such as Friday congregational worship, which has two rakats). Prayer is obligatory for all Muslims except those who are prepubescent, menstruating, or in puerperium stage after childbirth.

==Judaism==

Jewish liturgy is the prayer recitations that form part of the observance of Rabbinic Judaism. These prayers, often with instructions and commentary, are found in the &quot;siddur&quot;, the traditional Jewish prayer book. In general, Jewish men are obligated to pray three times a day within specific time ranges (&quot;zmanim&quot;), while, according most modern Orthodox authorities, women are only &quot;required&quot; to pray once daily, as they are generally exempted from obligations that are time dependent. All communal prayer requires a minyan, a quorum of 10 adults, to be present. 

Traditionally, three prayer services are recited daily:
# &quot;Shacharit&quot; or &quot;Shaharit&quot; (שַחֲרִת), from the Hebrew &quot;shachar&quot; or &quot;shahar&quot; (שַחָר) &quot;morning light&quot;,
# &quot;Mincha&quot; or &quot;Minha&quot; (מִנְחָה), the afternoon prayers named for the flour offering that accompanied sacrifices at the Temple in Jerusalem,
# &quot;Arvit&quot; (עַרְבִית) or &quot;Maariv&quot; (מַעֲרִיב), from &quot;nightfall&quot;.
Additional prayers:
* &quot;Musaf&quot; (מוּסָף, &quot;additional&quot;) is traditionally recited on Shabbat, major Jewish holidays (including Chol HaMoed), and Rosh Chodesh.
* A fifth prayer service, &quot;Ne&#x27;ila&quot; (נְעִילָה, &quot;closing&quot;), is recited only on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement.

<text>Megabats constitute the family Pteropodidae of the order Chiroptera. They are also called fruit bats, Old World fruit bats, or—especially the genera &quot;Acerodon&quot; and &quot;Pteropus&quot;—flying foxes. They are the only member of the superfamily Pteropodoidea, which is one of two superfamilies in the suborder Yinpterochiroptera. Internal divisions of Pteropodidae have varied since subfamilies were first proposed in 1917. From three subfamilies in the 1917 classification, six are now recognized, along with various tribes. As of 2018, 197 species of megabat had been described.

The leading theory of the evolution of megabats has been determined primarily by genetic data, as the fossil record for this family is the most fragmented of all bats. They likely evolved in Australasia, with the common ancestor of all living pteropodids existing approximately 31 million years ago. Many of their lineages probably originated in Melanesia, then dispersed over time to mainland Asia, the Mediterranean, and Africa. Today, they are found in tropical and subtropical areas of Eurasia, Africa, and Oceania.

The megabat family contains the largest bat species, with individuals of some species weighing up to and having wingspans up to . Not all megabats are large-bodied; nearly a third of all species weigh less than . They can be differentiated from other bats due to their dog-like faces, clawed second digits, and reduced uropatagium. A small number of species have tails. Megabats have several adaptations for flight, including rapid oxygen consumption, the ability to sustain heart rates of more than 700 beats per minute, and large lung volumes.

Most megabats are nocturnal or crepuscular, although a few species are active during the daytime. During the period of inactivity, they roost in trees or caves. Members of some species roost alone, while others form colonies of up to a million individuals. During the period of activity, they use flight to travel to food resources. With few exceptions, they are unable to echolocate, relying instead on keen senses of sight and smell to navigate and locate food. Most species are primarily frugivorous and several are nectarivorous. Other less common food resources include leaves, pollen, twigs, and bark.

They reach sexual maturity slowly and have a low reproductive output. Most species have one offspring at a time after a pregnancy of four to six months. This low reproductive output means that after a population loss their numbers are slow to rebound. A quarter of all species are listed as threatened, mainly due to habitat destruction and overhunting. Megabats are a popular food source in some areas, leading to population declines and extinction. They are also of interest to those involved in public health as they are natural reservoirs of several viruses that can affect humans.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
===Taxonomic history===
The family Pteropodidae was first described in 1821 by British zoologist John Edward Gray. He named the family &quot;Pteropidae&quot; (after the genus &quot;Pteropus&quot;) and placed it within the now-defunct order Fructivorae. Fructivorae contained one other family, the now-defunct Cephalotidae, containing one genus, &quot;Cephalotes&quot; (now recognized as a synonym of &quot;Dobsonia&quot;). Gray&#x27;s spelling was possibly based on a misunderstanding of the suffix of &quot;Pteropus&quot;. &quot;Pteropus&quot; comes from Ancient Greek meaning &quot;wing&quot; and meaning &quot;foot&quot;. The Greek word &quot;pous&quot; of &quot;Pteropus&quot; is from the stem word &quot;pod-&quot;; therefore, Latinizing &quot;Pteropus&quot; correctly results in the prefix &quot;Pteropod-&quot;. French biologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte was the first to use the corrected spelling Pteropodidae in 1838.

In 1875, the zoologist George Edward Dobson was the first to split the order Chiroptera (bats) into two suborders: Megachiroptera (sometimes listed as Macrochiroptera) and Microchiroptera, which are commonly abbreviated to megabats and microbats. Dobson selected these names to allude to the body size differences of the two groups, with many fruit-eating bats being larger than insect-eating bats. Pteropodidae was the only family he included within Megachiroptera.

A 2001 study found that the dichotomy of megabats and microbats did not accurately reflect their evolutionary relationships. Instead of Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera, the study&#x27;s authors proposed the new suborders Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera. This classification scheme has been verified several times subsequently and remains widely supported as of 2019. Since 2005, this suborder has alternatively been called &quot;Pteropodiformes&quot;. Yinpterochiroptera contained species formerly included in Megachiroptera (all of Pteropodidae), as well as several families formerly included in Microchiroptera: Megadermatidae, Rhinolophidae, Nycteridae, Craseonycteridae, and Rhinopomatidae. Two superfamilies comprise Yinpterochiroptera: Rhinolophoidea—containing the above families formerly in Microchiroptera—and Pteropodoidea, which only contains Pteropodidae.

In 1917, Danish mammalogist Knud Andersen divided Pteropodidae into three subfamilies: Macroglossinae, Pteropinae (corrected to Pteropodinae), and Harpyionycterinae. A 1995 study found that Macroglossinae as previously defined, containing the genera &quot;Eonycteris&quot;, &quot;Notopteris&quot;, &quot;Macroglossus&quot;, &quot;Syconycteris&quot;, &quot;Melonycteris&quot;, and &quot;Megaloglossus&quot;, was paraphyletic, meaning that the subfamily did not group all the descendants of a common ancestor. Subsequent publications consider Macroglossini as a tribe within Pteropodinae that contains only &quot;Macroglossus&quot; and &quot;Syconycteris&quot;. &quot;Eonycteris&quot; and &quot;Melonycteris&quot; are within other tribes in Pteropodinae, &quot;Megaloglossus&quot; was placed in the tribe Myonycterini of the subfamily Rousettinae, and &quot;Notopteris&quot; is of uncertain placement.

Other subfamilies and tribes within Pteropodidae have also undergone changes since Andersen&#x27;s 1917 publication. In 1997, the pteropodids were classified into six subfamilies and nine tribes based on their morphology, or physical characteristics. A 2011 genetic study concluded that some of these subfamilies were paraphyletic and therefore they did not accurately depict the relationships among megabat species. Three of the subfamilies proposed in 1997 based on morphology received support: Cynopterinae, Harpyionycterinae, and Nyctimeninae. The other three clades recovered in this study consisted of Macroglossini, Epomophorinae + Rousettini, and Pteropodini + &quot;Melonycteris&quot;. A 2016 genetic study focused only on African pteropodids (Harpyionycterinae, Rousettinae, and Epomophorinae) also challenged the 1997 classification. All species formerly included in Epomophorinae were moved to Rousettinae, which was subdivided into additional tribes. The genus &quot;Eidolon&quot;, formerly in the tribe Rousettini of Rousettinae, was moved to its own subfamily, Eidolinae.

In 1984, an additional pteropodid subfamily, Propottininae, was proposed, representing one extinct species described from a fossil discovered in Africa, &quot;Propotto leakeyi&quot;. In 2018 the fossils were reexamined and determined to represent a lemur. As of 2018, there were 197 described species of megabat, around a third of which are flying foxes of the genus &quot;Pteropus&quot;.

===Evolutionary history===
====Fossil record and divergence times====
The fossil record for pteropodid bats is the most incomplete of any bat family. Although the poor skeletal record of Chiroptera is probably from how fragile bat skeletons are, Pteropodidae still have the most incomplete despite generally having the biggest and most sturdy skeletons. It is also surprising that Pteropodidae are the least represented because they were the first major group to diverge. Several factors could explain why so few pteropodid fossils have been discovered: tropical regions where their fossils might be found are under-sampled relative to Europe and North America; conditions for fossilization are poor in the tropics, which could lead to fewer fossils overall; and even when fossils are formed, they may be destroyed by subsequent geological activity. It is estimated that more than 98% of pteropodid fossil history is missing. Even without fossils, the age and divergence times of the family can still be estimated by using computational phylogenetics. Pteropodidae split from the superfamily Rhinolophoidea (which contains all the other families of the suborder Yinpterochiroptera) approximately 58 Mya (million years ago). The ancestor of the crown group of Pteropodidae, or all living species, lived approximately 31 Mya.

====Biogeography====

The family Pteropodidae likely originated in Australasia based on biogeographic reconstructions. Other biogeographic analyses have suggested that the Melanesian Islands, including New Guinea, are a plausible candidate for the origin of most megabat subfamilies, with the exception of Cynopterinae; the cynopterines likely originated on the Sunda Shelf based on results of a Weighted Ancestral Area Analysis of six nuclear and mitochondrial genes. From these regions, pteropodids colonized other areas, including continental Asia and Africa. Megabats reached Africa in at least four distinct events. The four proposed events are represented by (1) &quot;Scotonycteris&quot;, (2) &quot;Rousettus&quot;, (3) Scotonycterini, and (4) the &quot;endemic Africa clade&quot;, which includes Stenonycterini, Plerotini, Myonycterini, and Epomophorini, according to a 2016 study. It is unknown when megabats reached Africa, but several tribes (Scotonycterini, Stenonycterini, Plerotini, Myonycterini, and Epomophorini) were present by the Late Miocene. How megabats reached Africa is also unknown. It has been proposed that they could have arrived via the Middle East before it became more arid at the end of the Miocene. Conversely, they could have reached the continent via the Gomphotherium land bridge, which connected Africa and the Arabian Peninsula to Eurasia. The genus &quot;Pteropus&quot; (flying foxes), which is not found on mainland Africa, is proposed to have dispersed from Melanesia via island hopping across the Indian Ocean; this is less likely for other megabat genera, which have smaller body sizes and thus have more limited flight capabilities.

====Echolocation====
Megabats are the only family of bats incapable of laryngeal echolocation. It is unclear whether the common ancestor of all bats was capable of echolocation, and thus echolocation was lost in the megabat lineage, or multiple bat lineages independently evolved the ability to echolocate (the superfamily Rhinolophoidea and the suborder Yangochiroptera). This unknown element of bat evolution has been called a &quot;grand challenge in biology&quot;. A 2017 study of bat ontogeny (embryonic development) found evidence that megabat embryos at first have large, developed cochlea similar to echolocating microbats, though at birth they have small cochlea similar to non-echolocating mammals. This evidence supports that laryngeal echolocation evolved once among bats, and was lost in pteropodids, rather than evolving twice independently. Megabats in the genus &quot;Rousettus&quot; are capable of primitive echolocation through clicking their tongues. Some species—the cave nectar bat (&quot;Eonycteris spelaea&quot;), lesser short-nosed fruit bat (&quot;Cynopterus brachyotis&quot;), and the long-tongued fruit bat (&quot;Macroglossus sobrinus&quot;)—have been shown to create clicks similar to those of echolocating bats using their wings.

Both echolocation and flight are energetically expensive processes separately, although no increase in flight energy expenditure was found for two species of echolocating bats compared with other bats and birds . Echolocating bats couple sound production with the mechanisms engaged for flight, allowing them to reduce the additional energy burden of echolocation. Instead of pressurizing a bolus of air for the production of sound, laryngeally echolocating bats likely use the force of the downbeat of their wings to pressurize the air, cutting energetic costs by synchronizing wingbeats and echolocation. The loss of echolocation (or conversely, the lack of its evolution) may be due to the uncoupling of flight and echolocation in megabats. The larger average body size of megabats compared to echolocating bats suggests a larger body size disrupts the flight-echolocation coupling and made echolocation too energetically expensive to be conserved in megabats.

==Description==
===Appearance===

Megabats take their name from their larger weight and size; the largest, the great flying fox (&quot;Pteropus neohibernicus&quot;), weighs up to ; some members of &quot;Acerodon&quot; and &quot;Pteropus&quot; have wingspans reaching up to . Despite the fact that body size was a defining characteristic that Dobson used to separate microbats and megabats, not all species of megabat are larger than microbats; the spotted-winged fruit bat (&quot;Balionycteris maculata&quot;), a megabat, weighs only . The flying foxes of &quot;Pteropus&quot; and &quot;Acerodon&quot; are often taken as exemplars of the whole family in terms of body size. In reality, these genera are outliers, creating a misconception of the true size of most megabat species. A 2004 review stated that 28% of megabat species weigh less than .

Megabats can be distinguished from microbats in appearance by their dog-like faces, by the presence of claws on the second digit (see Megabat#Postcrania), and by their simple ears. The simple appearance of the ear is due in part to the lack of tragi (cartilage flaps projecting in front of the ear canal), which are found in many microbat species. Megabats of the genus &quot;Nyctimene&quot; appear less dog-like, with shorter faces and tubular nostrils. A 2011 study of 167 megabat species found that while the majority (63%) have fur that is a uniform color, other patterns are seen in this family. These include countershading in four percent of species, a neck band or mantle in five percent of species, stripes in ten percent of species, and spots in nineteen percent of species.

Unlike microbats, megabats have a greatly reduced uropatagium, which is an expanse of flight membrane that runs between the hind limbs. Additionally, the tail is absent or greatly reduced, with the exception of &quot;Notopteris&quot; species, which have a long tail. Most megabat wings insert laterally (attach to the body directly at the sides). In &quot;Dobsonia&quot; species, the wings attach nearer the spine, giving them the common name of &quot;bare-backed&quot; or &quot;naked-backed&quot; fruit bats.

Megabats have large orbits, which are bordered by well-developed postorbital processes posteriorly. The postorbital processes sometimes join to form the postorbital bar. The snout is simple in appearance and not highly modified, as is seen in other bat families. The length of the snout varies among genera. The premaxilla is well-developed and usually free, meaning that it is not fused with the maxilla; instead, it articulates with the maxilla via ligaments, making it freely movable. The premaxilla always lack a palatal branch. In species with a longer snout, the skull is usually arched. In genera with shorter faces (&quot;Penthetor&quot;, &quot;Nyctimene&quot;, &quot;Dobsonia&quot;, and &quot;Myonycteris&quot;), the skull has little to no bending.

Megabat species have relatively small incisors and large canines. The premolars and molars are adapted to crush and pierce fruit, their primary food source. 

The most complete dental formula is: I2/2, C 1/1, P3/3, M2/3 x 2 = 34. The dental formula of 34 teeth is a homologous trait for megabats. The total number of teeth varies among megabat species, and can range from 24 to 34. For example, some species of megabats have only 2 molars on either side of the lower jaw instead of 3. Others may lack one or more pairs of incisors on the upper or lower jaw. 

All megabats have two to four each of upper and lower incisors, with the exception Bulmer&#x27;s fruit bat (&quot;Aproteles bulmerae&quot;), which completely lacks incisors, and the São Tomé collared fruit bat (&quot;Myonycteris brachycephala&quot;), which has two upper and three lower incisors. This makes it the only mammal species with an asymmetrical dental formula.

All species have two upper and lower canine teeth. The number of premolars is variable, with four or six each of upper and lower premolars.
The first upper and lower molars are always present, meaning that all megabats have at least four molars. The remaining molars may be present, present but reduced, or absent. Megabat molars and premolars are simplified, with a reduction in the cusps and ridges resulting in a more flattened crown.

Like most mammals, megabats are diphyodont, meaning that the young have a set of deciduous teeth (milk teeth) that falls out and is replaced by permanent teeth. For most species, there are 20 deciduous teeth. As is typical for mammals, the deciduous set does not include molars.

====Postcrania====

The scapulae (shoulder blades) of megabats have been described as the most primitive of any chiropteran family. The shoulder is overall of simple construction, but has some specialized features. The primitive insertion of the omohyoid muscle from the clavicle (collarbone) to the scapula is laterally displaced (more towards the side of the body)—a feature also seen in the Phyllostomidae. The shoulder also has a well-developed system of muscular slips (narrow bands of muscle that augment larger muscles) that anchor the tendon of the occipitopollicalis muscle (muscle in bats that runs from base of neck to the base of the thumb) to the skin.

While microbats only have claws on the thumbs of their forelimbs, most megabats have a clawed second digit as well; only &quot;Eonycteris&quot;, &quot;Dobsonia&quot;, &quot;Notopteris&quot;, and &quot;Neopteryx&quot; lack the second claw. The first digit is the shortest, while the third digit is the longest. The second digit is incapable of flexion. Megabats&#x27; thumbs are longer relative to their forelimbs than those of microbats.

Megabats&#x27; hindlimbs have the same skeletal components as humans. Most megabat species have an additional structure called the calcar, a cartilage spur arising from the calcaneus. Some authors alternately refer to this structure as the uropatagial spur to differentiate it from microbats&#x27; calcars, which are structured differently. The structure exists to stabilize the uropatagium, allowing bats to adjust the camber of the membrane during flight. Megabats lacking the calcar or spur include &quot;Notopteris&quot;, &quot;Syconycteris&quot;, and &quot;Harpyionycteris&quot;. The entire leg is rotated at the hip compared to normal mammal orientation, meaning that the knees face posteriorly. All five digits of the foot flex in the direction of the sagittal plane, with no digit capable of flexing in the opposite direction, as in the feet of perching birds.

===Internal systems===

Flight is very energetically expensive, requiring several adaptations to the cardiovascular system. During flight, bats can raise their oxygen consumption by twenty times or more for sustained periods; human athletes can achieve an increase of a factor of twenty for a few minutes at most. A 1994 study of the straw-coloured fruit bat (&quot;Eidolon helvum&quot;) and hammer-headed bat (&quot;Hypsignathus monstrosus&quot;) found a mean respiratory exchange ratio (carbon dioxide produced:oxygen used) of approximately 0.78. Among these two species, the gray-headed flying fox (&quot;Pteropus poliocephalus&quot;) and the Egyptian fruit bat (&quot;Rousettus aegyptiacus&quot;), maximum heart rates in flight varied between 476 beats per minute (gray-headed flying fox) and 728 beats per minute (Egyptian fruit bat). The maximum number of breaths per minute ranged from 163 (gray-headed flying fox) to 316 (straw-colored fruit bat). Additionally, megabats have exceptionally large lung volumes relative to their sizes. While terrestrial mammals such as shrews have a lung volume of 0.03 cm3 per gram of body weight (0.05 in3 per ounce of body weight), species such as the Wahlberg&#x27;s epauletted fruit bat (&quot;Epomophorus wahlbergi&quot;) have lung volumes 4.3 times greater at 0.13 cm3 per gram (0.22 in3 per ounce).

Megabats have rapid digestive systems, with a gut transit time of half an hour or less. The digestive system is structured to a herbivorous diet sometimes restricted to soft fruit or nectar. The length of the digestive system is short for a herbivore (as well as shorter than those of insectivorous microchiropterans), as the fibrous content is mostly separated by the action of the palate, tongue, and teeth, and then discarded. Many megabats have U-shaped stomachs. There is no distinct difference between the small and large intestine, nor a distinct beginning of the rectum. They have very high densities of intestinal microvilli, which creates a large surface area for the absorption of nutrients.

==Biology and ecology==
===Genome size===
Like all bats, megabats have much smaller genomes than other mammals. A 2009 study of 43 megabat species found that their genomes ranged from 1.86 picograms (pg, 978 Mbp per pg) in the straw-colored fruit bat to 2.51 pg in Lyle&#x27;s flying fox (&quot;Pteropus lylei&quot;). All values were much lower than the mammalian average of 3.5 pg. Megabats have even smaller genomes than microbats, with a mean weight of 2.20 pg compared to 2.58 pg. It was speculated that this difference could be related to the fact that the megabat lineage has experienced an extinction of the LINE1—a type of long interspersed nuclear element. LINE1 constitutes 15–20% of the human genome and is considered the most prevalent long interspersed nuclear element among mammals.

===Senses===
====Sight====

With very few exceptions, megabats do not echolocate, and therefore rely on sight and smell to navigate. They have large eyes positioned at the front of their heads. These are larger than those of the common ancestor of all bats, with one study suggesting a trend of increasing eye size among pteropodids. A study that examined the eyes of 18 megabat species determined that the common blossom bat (&quot;Syconycteris australis&quot;) had the smallest eyes at a diameter of , while the largest eyes were those of large flying fox (&quot;Pteropus vampyrus&quot;) at in diameter. Megabat irises are usually brown, but they can be red or orange, as in &quot;Desmalopex&quot;, &quot;Mirimiri&quot;, &quot;Pteralopex&quot;, and some &quot;Pteropus&quot;.

At high brightness levels, megabat visual acuity is poorer than that of humans; at low brightness it is superior. One study that examined the eyes of some &quot;Rousettus&quot;, &quot;Epomophorus&quot;, &quot;Eidolon&quot;, and &quot;Pteropus&quot; species determined that the first three genera possess a &quot;tapetum lucidum&quot;, a reflective structure in the eyes that improves vision at low light levels, while the &quot;Pteropus&quot; species do not. All species examined had retinae with both rod cells and cone cells, but only the &quot;Pteropus&quot; species had S-cones, which detect the shortest wavelengths of light; because the spectral tuning of the opsins was not discernible, it is unclear whether the S-cones of &quot;Pteropus&quot; species detect blue or ultraviolet light. &quot;Pteropus&quot; bats are dichromatic, possessing two kinds of cone cells. The other three genera, with their lack of S-cones, are monochromatic, unable to see color. All genera had very high densities of rod cells, resulting in high sensitivity to light, which corresponds with their nocturnal activity patterns. In &quot;Pteropus&quot; and &quot;Rousettus&quot;, measured rod cell densities were 350,000–800,000 per square millimeter, equal to or exceeding other nocturnal or crepuscular animals such as the house mouse, domestic cat, and domestic rabbit.

====Smell====

Megabats use smell to find food sources like fruit and nectar. They have keen senses of smell that rival that of the domestic dog. Tube-nosed fruit bats such as the eastern tube-nosed bat (&quot;Nyctimene robinsoni&quot;) have stereo olfaction, meaning they are able to map and follow odor plumes three-dimensionally.
Along with most (or perhaps all) other bat species, megabats mothers and offspring also use scent to recognize each other, as well as for recognition of individuals. In flying foxes, males have enlarged androgen-sensitive sebaceous glands on their shoulders they use for scent-marking their territories, particularly during the mating season. The secretions of these glands vary by species—of the 65 chemical compounds isolated from the glands of four species, no compound was found in all species. Males also engage in urine washing, or coating themselves in their own urine.

====Taste====
Megabats possess the &quot;TAS1R2&quot; gene, meaning they have the ability to detect sweetness in foods. This gene is present among all bats except vampire bats. Like all other bats, megabats cannot taste &quot;umami&quot;, due to the absence of the &quot;TAS1R1&quot; gene. Among other mammals, only giant pandas have been shown to lack this gene. Megabats also have multiple &quot;TAS2R&quot; genes, indicating that they can taste bitterness.

===Reproduction and life cycle===

Megabats, like all bats, are long-lived relative to their size for mammals. Some captive megabats have had lifespans exceeding thirty years. Relative to their sizes, megabats have low reproductive outputs and delayed sexual maturity, with females of most species not giving birth until the age of one or two. Some megabats appear to be able to breed throughout the year, but the majority of species are likely seasonal breeders. Mating occurs at the roost. Gestation length is variable, but is four to six months in most species. Different species of megabats have reproductive adaptations that lengthen the period between copulation and giving birth. Some species such as the straw-colored fruit bat have the reproductive adaptation of delayed implantation, meaning that copulation occurs in June or July, but the zygote does not implant into the uterine wall until months later in November. The Fischer&#x27;s pygmy fruit bat (&quot;Haplonycteris fischeri&quot;), with the adaptation of post-implantation delay, has the longest gestation length of any bat species, at up to 11.5 months. The post-implantation delay means that development of the embryo is suspended for up to eight months after implantation in the uterine wall, which is responsible for its very long pregnancies. Shorter gestation lengths are found in the greater short-nosed fruit bat (&quot;Cynopterus sphinx&quot;) with a period of three months.

The litter size of all megabats is usually one. There are scarce records of twins in the following species: Madagascan flying fox (&quot;Pteropus rufus&quot;), Dobson&#x27;s epauletted fruit bat (&quot;Epomops dobsoni&quot;), the gray-headed flying fox, the black flying fox (&quot;Pteropus alecto&quot;), the spectacled flying fox (&quot;Pteropus conspicillatus&quot;), the greater short-nosed fruit bat, Peters&#x27;s epauletted fruit bat (&quot;Epomophorus crypturus&quot;), the hammer-headed bat, the straw-colored fruit bat, the little collared fruit bat (&quot;Myonycteris torquata&quot;), the Egyptian fruit bat, and Leschenault&#x27;s rousette (&quot;Rousettus leschenaultii&quot;). In the cases of twins, it is rare that both offspring survive. Because megabats, like all bats, have low reproductive rates, their populations are slow to recover from declines.

At birth, megabat offspring are, on average, 17.5% of their mother&#x27;s post-partum weight. This is the smallest offspring-to-mother ratio for any bat family; across all bats, newborns are 22.3% of their mother&#x27;s post-partum weight. Megabat offspring are not easily categorized into the traditional categories of altricial (helpless at birth) or precocial (capable at birth). Species such as the greater short-nosed fruit bat are born with their eyes open (a sign of precocial offspring), whereas the Egyptian fruit bat offspring&#x27;s eyes do not open until nine days after birth (a sign of altricial offspring).

As with nearly all bat species, males do not assist females in parental care.
The young stay with their mothers until they are weaned; how long weaning takes varies throughout the family. Megabats, like all bats, have relatively long nursing periods: offspring will nurse until they are approximately 71% of adult body mass, compared to 40% of adult body mass in non-bat mammals. Species in the genus &quot;Micropteropus&quot; wean their young by seven to eight weeks of age, whereas the Indian flying fox (&quot;Pteropus medius&quot;) does not wean its young until five months of age. Very unusually, male individuals of two megabat species, the Bismarck masked flying fox (&quot;Pteropus capistratus&quot;) and the Dayak fruit bat (&quot;Dyacopterus spadiceus&quot;), have been observed producing milk, but there has never been an observation of a male nursing young. It is unclear if the lactation is functional and males actually nurse pups or if it is a result of stress or malnutrition.

===Behavior and social systems===

Many megabat species are highly gregarious or social. Megabats will vocalize to communicate with each other, creating noises described as &quot;trill-like bursts of sound&quot;, honking, or loud, bleat-like calls in various genera. At least one species, the Egyptian fruit bat, is capable of a kind of vocal learning called vocal production learning, defined as &quot;the ability to modify vocalizations in response to interactions with conspecifics&quot;. Young Egyptian fruit bats are capable of acquiring a dialect by listening to their mothers, as well as other individuals in their colonies. It has been postulated that these dialect differences may result in individuals of different colonies communicating at different frequencies, for instance.

Megabat social behavior includes using sexual behaviors for more than just reproduction. Evidence suggests that female Egyptian fruit bats take food from males in exchange for sex. Paternity tests confirmed that the males from which each female scrounged food had a greater likelihood of fathering the scrounging female&#x27;s offspring.
Homosexual fellatio has been observed in at least one species, the Bonin flying fox (&quot;Pteropus pselaphon&quot;). This same-sex fellatio is hypothesized to encourage colony formation of otherwise-antagonistic males in colder climates.

Megabats are mostly nocturnal and crepuscular, though some have been observed flying during the day. A few island species and subspecies are diurnal, hypothesized as a response to a lack of predators.
Diurnal taxa include a subspecies of the black-eared flying fox (&quot;Pteropus melanotus natalis&quot;), the Mauritian flying fox (&quot;Pteropus niger&quot;), the Caroline flying fox (&quot;Pteropus molossinus&quot;), a subspecies of &quot;Pteropus pelagicus&quot; (&quot;P. p. insularis&quot;), and the Seychelles fruit bat (&quot;Pteropus seychellensis&quot;).

====Roosting====
A 1992 summary of forty-one megabat genera noted that twenty-nine are tree-roosting genera. A further eleven genera roost in caves, and the remaining six genera roost in other kinds of sites (human structures, mines, and crevices, for example). Tree-roosting species can be solitary or highly colonial, forming aggregations of up to one million individuals. Cave-roosting species form aggregations ranging from ten individuals up to several thousand. Highly colonial species often exhibit roost fidelity, meaning that their trees or caves may be used as roosts for many years. Solitary species or those that aggregate in smaller numbers have less fidelity to their roosts.

===Diet and foraging===

Most megabats are primarily frugivorous. Throughout the family, a diverse array of fruit is consumed from nearly 188 plant genera. Some species are also nectarivorous, meaning that they also drink nectar from flowers. In Australia, &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; flowers are an especially important food source. Other food resources include leaves, shoots, buds, pollen, seed pods, sap, cones, bark, and twigs. They are prodigious eaters and can consume up to 2.5 times their own body weight in fruit per night.

Megabats fly to roosting and foraging resources. They typically fly straight and relatively fast for bats; some species are slower with greater maneuverability. Species can commute in a night. Migratory species of the genera &quot;Eidolon&quot;, &quot;Pteropus&quot;, &quot;Epomophorus&quot;, &quot;Rousettus&quot;, &quot;Myonycteris&quot;, and &quot;Nanonycteris&quot; can migrate distances up to . Most megabats have below-average aspect ratios, which is measurement relating wingspan and wing area. Wing loading, which measures weight relative to wing area, is average or higher than average in megabats.

====Seed dispersal====
Megabats play an important role in seed dispersal. As a result of their long evolutionary history, some plants have evolved characteristics compatible with bat senses, including fruits that are strongly scented, brightly colored, and prominently exposed away from foliage. The bright colors and positioning of the fruit may reflect megabats&#x27; reliance on visual cues and inability to navigate through clutter. In a study that examined the fruits of more than forty fig species, only one fig species was consumed by both birds and megabats; most species are consumed by one or the other. Bird-consumed figs are frequently red or orange, while megabat-consumed figs are often yellow or green. Most seeds are excreted shortly after consumption due to a rapid gut transit time, but some seeds can remain in the gut for more than twelve hours. This heightens megabats&#x27; capacity to disperse seeds far from parent trees. As highly mobile frugivores, megabats have the capacity to restore forest between isolated forest fragments by dispersing tree seeds to deforested landscapes. This dispersal ability is limited to plants with small seeds that are less than in length, as seeds larger than this are not ingested.

===Predators and parasites===

Megabats, especially those living on islands, have few native predators. Non-native predators of flying foxes include domestic cats and rats. The mangrove monitor, which is a native predator for some megabat species but an introduced predator for others, opportunistically preys on megabats, as it is a capable tree climber. Another species, the brown tree snake, can seriously impact megabat populations; as a non-native predator in Guam, the snake consumes so many offspring that it reduced the recruitment of the population of the Mariana fruit bat (&quot;Pteropus mariannus&quot;) to essentially zero. The island is now considered a sink for the Mariana fruit bat, as its population there relies on bats immigrating from the nearby island of Rota to bolster it rather than successful reproduction. Predators that are naturally sympatric with megabats include reptiles such as crocodilians, snakes, and large lizards, as well as birds like falcons, hawks, and owls. The saltwater crocodile is a known predator of megabats, based on analysis of crocodile stomach contents in northern Australia. During extreme heat events, megabats like the little red flying fox (&quot;Pteropus scapulatus&quot;) must cool off and rehydrate by drinking from waterways, making them susceptible to opportunistic depredation by freshwater crocodiles.

Megabats are the hosts of several parasite taxa. Known parasites include Nycteribiidae and Streblidae species (&quot;bat flies&quot;), as well as mites of the genus &quot;Demodex&quot;. Blood parasites of the family Haemoproteidae and intestinal nematodes of Toxocaridae also affect megabat species.

==Range and habitat==

Megabats are widely distributed in the tropics of the Old World, occurring throughout Africa, Asia, Australia, and throughout the islands of the Indian Ocean and Oceania. As of 2013, fourteen genera of megabat are present in Africa, representing twenty-eight species. Of those twenty-eight species, twenty-four are only found in tropical or subtropical climates. The remaining four species are mostly found in the tropics, but their ranges also encompass temperate climates. In respect to habitat types, eight are exclusively or mostly found in forested habitat; nine are found in both forests and savannas; nine are found exclusively or mostly in savannas; and two are found on islands. Only one African species, the long-haired rousette (&quot;Rousettus lanosus&quot;), is found mostly in montane ecosystems, but an additional thirteen species&#x27; ranges extend into montane habitat.

Outside of Southeast Asia, megabats have relatively low species richness in Asia. The Egyptian fruit bat is the only megabat whose range is mostly in the Palearctic realm; it and the straw-colored fruit bat are the only species found in the Middle East. The northernmost extent of the Egyptian fruit bat&#x27;s range is the northeastern Mediterranean. In East Asia, megabats are found only in China and Japan. In China, only six species of megabat are considered resident, while another seven are present marginally (at the edge of their ranges), questionably (due to possible misidentification), or as accidental migrants. Four megabat species, all &quot;Pteropus&quot;, are found on Japan, but none on its five main islands. In South Asia, megabat species richness ranges from two species in the Maldives to thirteen species in India. Megabat species richness in Southeast Asia is as few as five species in the small country of Singapore and seventy-six species in Indonesia. Of the ninety-eight species of megabat found in Asia, forest is a habitat for ninety-five of them. Other habitat types include human-modified land (66 species), caves (23 species), savanna (7 species), shrubland (4 species), rocky areas (3 species), grassland (2 species), and desert (1 species).

In Australia, five genera and eight species of megabat are present. These genera are &quot;Pteropus&quot;, &quot;Syconycteris&quot;, &quot;Dobsonia&quot;, &quot;Nyctimene&quot;, and &quot;Macroglossus&quot;. &quot;Pteropus&quot; species of Australia are found in a variety of habitats, including mangrove-dominated forests, rainforests, and the wet sclerophyll forests of the Australian bush. Australian &quot;Pteropus&quot; are often found in association with humans, as they situate their large colonies in urban areas, particularly in May and June when the greatest proportions of &quot;Pteropus&quot; species populations are found in these urban colonies.

In Oceania, the countries of Palau and Tonga have the fewest megabat species, with one each. Papua New Guinea has the greatest number of species with thirty-six. Of the sixty-five species of Oceania, forest is a habitat for fifty-eight. Other habitat types include human-modified land (42 species), caves (9 species), savanna (5 species), shrubland (3 species), and rocky areas (3 species). An estimated nineteen percent of all megabat species are endemic to a single island; of all bat families, only Myzopodidae—containing two species, both single-island endemics—has a higher rate of single-island endemism.

==Relationship to humans==
===Food===

Megabats are killed and eaten as bushmeat throughout their range. Bats are consumed extensively throughout Asia, as well as in islands of the West Indian Ocean and the Pacific, where &quot;Pteropus&quot; species are heavily hunted. In continental Africa where no &quot;Pteropus&quot; species live, the straw-colored fruit bat, the region&#x27;s largest megabat, is a preferred hunting target.

In Guam, consumption of the Mariana fruit bat exposes locals to the neurotoxin beta-Methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) which may later lead to neurodegenerative diseases. BMAA may become particularly biomagnified in humans who consume flying foxes; flying foxes are exposed to BMAA by eating cycad fruits.

=== As disease reservoirs ===
Megabats are the reservoirs of several viruses that can affect humans and cause disease. They can carry filoviruses, including the Ebola virus (EBOV) and &quot;Marburgvirus&quot;. The presence of &quot;Marburgvirus&quot;, which causes Marburg virus disease, has been confirmed in one species, the Egyptian fruit bat. The disease is rare, but the fatality rate of an outbreak can reach up to 88%. The virus was first recognized after simultaneous outbreaks in the German cities of Marburg and Frankfurt as well as Belgrade, Serbia, in 1967, where 31 people became ill and seven died. The outbreak was traced to laboratory work with vervet monkeys from Uganda. The virus can pass from a bat host to a human (who has usually spent a prolonged period in a mine or cave where Egyptian fruit bats live); from there, it can spread person-to-person through contact with infected bodily fluids, including blood and semen. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists a total of 601 confirmed cases of Marburg virus disease from 1967 to 2014, of which 373 people died (62% overall mortality).

Species that have tested positive for the presence of EBOV include Franquet&#x27;s epauletted fruit bat (&quot;Epomops franqueti&quot;), the hammer-headed fruit bat, and the little collared fruit bat. Additionally, antibodies against EBOV have been found in the straw-colored fruit bat, Gambian epauletted fruit bat (&quot;Epomophorus gambianus&quot;), Peters&#x27;s dwarf epauletted fruit bat (&quot;Micropteropus pusillus&quot;), Veldkamp&#x27;s dwarf epauletted fruit bat (&quot;Nanonycteris veldkampii&quot;), Leschenault&#x27;s rousette, and the Egyptian fruit bat. Much of how humans contract the Ebola virus is unknown. Scientists hypothesize that humans initially become infected through contact with an infected animal such as a megabat or non-human primate. Megabats are presumed to be a natural reservoir of the Ebola virus, but this has not been firmly established. Microbats are also being investigated as the reservoir of the virus, with the greater long-fingered bat (&quot;Miniopterus inflatus&quot;) once found to harbor a fifth of the virus&#x27;s genome (though not testing positive for the actual virus) in 2019. Due to the likely association between Ebola infection and &quot;hunting, butchering and processing meat from infected animals&quot;, several West African countries banned bushmeat (including megabats) or issued warnings about it during the 2013–2016 epidemic; many bans have since been lifted.

Other megabats implicated as disease reservoirs are primarily &quot;Pteropus&quot; species. Notably, flying foxes can transmit Australian bat lyssavirus, which, along with the rabies virus, causes rabies. Australian bat lyssavirus was first identified in 1996; it is very rarely transmitted to humans. Transmission occurs from the bite or scratch of an infected animal but can also occur from getting the infected animal&#x27;s saliva in a mucous membrane or an open wound. Exposure to flying fox blood, urine, or feces cannot cause infections of Australian bat lyssavirus. Since 1994, there have been three records of people becoming infected with it in Queensland—each case was fatal.

Flying foxes are also reservoirs of henipaviruses such as Hendra virus and Nipah virus. Hendra virus was first identified in 1994; it rarely occurs in humans. From 1994 to 2013, there have been seven reported cases of Hendra virus affecting people, four of which were fatal. The hypothesized primary route of human infection is via contact with horses that have come into contact with flying fox urine. There are no documented instances of direct transmission between flying foxes and humans. As of 2012, there is a vaccine available for horses to decrease the likelihood of infection and transmission.

Nipah virus was first identified in 1998 in Malaysia. Since 1998, there have been several Nipah outbreaks in Malaysia, Singapore, India, and Bangladesh, resulting in over 100 casualties. A 2018 outbreak in Kerala, India, resulted in 19 humans becoming infected—17 died. The overall fatality rate is 40–75%. Humans can contract Nipah virus from direct contact with flying foxes or their fluids, through exposure to an intermediate host such as domestic pigs, or from contact with an infected person. A 2014 study of the Indian flying fox and Nipah virus found that while Nipah virus outbreaks are more likely in areas preferred by flying foxes, &quot;the presence of bats in and of itself is not considered a risk factor for Nipah virus infection.&quot; Rather, the consumption of date palm sap is a significant route of transmission. The practice of date palm sap collection involves placing collecting pots at date palm trees. Indian flying foxes have been observed licking the sap as it flows into the pots, as well as defecating and urinating in proximity to the pots. In this way, humans who drink palm wine can be exposed to henipaviruses. The use of bamboo skirts on collecting pots lowers the risk of contamination from bat urine.

Flying foxes can transmit several non-lethal diseases as well, such as Menangle virus and Nelson Bay virus. These viruses rarely affect humans, and few cases have been reported. Megabats are not suspected to be vectors of coronaviruses.

===In culture===

Megabats, particularly flying foxes, are featured in indigenous cultures and traditions. Folk stories from Australia and Papua New Guinea feature them.
They were also included in Indigenous Australian cave art, as evinced by several surviving examples.

Indigenous societies in Oceania used parts of flying foxes for functional and ceremonial weapons. In the Solomon Islands, people created barbs out of their bones for use in spears. In New Caledonia, ceremonial axes made of jade were decorated with braids of flying fox fur. Flying fox wings were depicted on the war shields of the Asmat people of Indonesia; they believed that the wings offered protection to their warriors.

There are modern and historical references to flying fox byproducts used as currency. In New Caledonia, braided flying fox fur was once used as currency.
On the island of Makira, which is part of the Solomon Islands, indigenous peoples still hunt flying foxes for their teeth as well as for bushmeat.
The canine teeth are strung together on necklaces that are used as currency. Teeth of the insular flying fox (&quot;Pteropus tonganus&quot;) are particularly prized, as they are usually large enough to drill holes in. The Makira flying fox (&quot;Pteropus cognatus&quot;) is also hunted, despite its smaller teeth. Deterring people from using flying fox teeth as currency may be detrimental to the species, with Lavery and Fasi noting, &quot;Species that provide an important cultural resource can be highly treasured.&quot; Emphasizing sustainable hunting of flying foxes to preserve cultural currency may be more effective than encouraging the abandonment of cultural currency. Even if flying foxes were no longer hunted for their teeth, they would still be killed for bushmeat; therefore, retaining their cultural value may encourage sustainable hunting practices. Lavery stated, &quot;It&#x27;s a positive, not a negative, that their teeth are so culturally valuable. The practice of hunting bats shouldn&#x27;t necessarily be stopped, it needs to be managed sustainably.&quot;

==Conservation==
===Status===

As of 2014, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) evaluated a quarter of all megabat species as threatened, which includes species listed as critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable. Megabats are substantially threatened by humans, as they are hunted for food and medicinal uses.
Additionally, they are culled for actual or perceived damage to agriculture, especially to fruit production. As of 2019, the IUCN had evaluations for 187 megabat species. The status breakdown is as follows:
* Extinct: 4 species (2.1%)
* Critically endangered: 8 species (4.3%)
* Endangered: 16 species (8.6%)
* Vulnerable: 37 species (19.8%)
* Near-threatened: 13 species (7.0%)
* Least-concern: 89 species (47.6%)
* Data deficient: 20 species (10.7%)

===Factors causing decline===
====Anthropogenic sources====
Megabats are threatened by habitat destruction by humans. Deforestation of their habitats has resulted in the loss of critical roosting habitat. Deforestation also results in the loss of food resource, as native fruit-bearing trees are felled. Habitat loss and resulting urbanization leads to construction of new roadways, making megabat colonies easier to access for overharvesting. Additionally, habitat loss via deforestation compounds natural threats, as fragmented forests are more susceptible to damage from typhoon-force winds. Cave-roosting megabats are threatened by human disturbance at their roost sites. Guano mining is a livelihood in some countries within their range, bringing people to caves. Caves are also disturbed by mineral mining and cave tourism.

Megabats are also killed by humans, intentionally and unintentionally. Half of all megabat species are hunted for food, in comparison to only eight percent of insectivorous species, while human persecution stemming from perceived damage to crops is also a large source of mortality. Some megabats have been documented to have a preference for native fruit trees over fruit crops, but deforestation can reduce their food supply, causing them to rely on fruit crops. They are shot, beaten to death, or poisoned to reduce their populations. Mortality also occurs via accidental entanglement in netting used to prevent the bats from eating fruit. Culling campaigns can dramatically reduce megabat populations. In Mauritius, over 40,000 Mauritian flying foxes were culled between 2014 and 2016, reducing the species&#x27; population by an estimated 45%. Megabats are also killed by electrocution. In one Australian orchard, it is estimated that over 21,000 bats were electrocuted to death in an eight-week period. Farmers construct electrified grids over their fruit trees to kill megabats before they can consume their crop. The grids are questionably effective at preventing crop loss, with one farmer who operated such a grid estimating they still lost of fruit to flying foxes in a year. Some electrocution deaths are also accidental, such as when bats fly into overhead power lines.

Climate change causes flying fox mortality and is a source of concern for species persistence. Extreme heat waves in Australia have been responsible for the deaths of more than 30,000 flying foxes from 1994 to 2008. Females and young bats are most susceptible to extreme heat, which affects a population&#x27;s ability to recover. Megabats are threatened by sea level rise associated with climate change, as several species are endemic to low-lying atolls.

====Natural sources====
Because many species are endemic to a single island, they are vulnerable to random events such as typhoons. A 1979 typhoon halved the remaining population of the Rodrigues flying fox (&quot;Pteropus rodricensis&quot;). Typhoons result in indirect mortality as well: because typhoons defoliate the trees, they make megabats more visible and thus more easily hunted by humans. Food resources for the bats become scarce after major storms, and megabats resort to riskier foraging strategies such as consuming fallen fruit off the ground. There, they are more vulnerable to depredation by domestic cats, dogs, and pigs. As many megabat species are located in the tectonically active Ring of Fire, they are also threatened by volcanic eruptions. Flying foxes, including the endangered Mariana fruit bat, have been nearly exterminated from the island of Anatahan following a series of eruptions beginning in 2003.

<text>A puzzle is a game, problem, or toy that tests a person&#x27;s ingenuity or knowledge. In a puzzle, the solver is expected to put pieces together (or take them apart) in a logical way, in order to find the solution of the puzzle. There are different genres of puzzles, such as crossword puzzles, word-search puzzles, number puzzles, relational puzzles, and logic puzzles. The academic study of puzzles is called enigmatology.

Puzzles are often created to be a form of entertainment but they can also arise from serious mathematical or logical problems. In such cases, their solution may be a significant contribution to mathematical research.

==Etymology==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; dates the word &quot;puzzle&quot; (as a verb) to the 16th century. Its earliest use documented in the &quot;OED&quot; was in a book titled &quot;The Voyage of Robert Dudley...to the West Indies, 1594–95, narrated by Capt. Wyatt, by himself, and by Abram Kendall, master&quot; (published circa 1595). The word later came to be used as a noun, first as an abstract noun meaning &#x27;the state or condition of being puzzled&#x27;, and later developing the meaning of &#x27;a perplexing problem&#x27;. The &quot;OED&quot;″s earliest clear citation in the sense of &#x27;a toy that tests the player&#x27;s ingenuity&#x27; is from Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s 1814 novel &quot;Waverley&quot;, referring to a toy known as a &quot;reel in a bottle&quot;.

The etymology of the verb &quot;puzzle&quot; is described by &quot;OED&quot; as &quot;unknown&quot;; unproven hypotheses regarding its origin include an Old English verb &quot;puslian&quot; meaning &#x27;pick out&#x27;, and a derivation of the verb &quot;pose&quot;.

==Categories==
Puzzles can be categorized as:

*Lateral thinking puzzles, also called &quot;situation puzzles&quot;
*Mathematical puzzles include the missing square puzzle and many impossible puzzles — puzzles which have no solution, such as the Seven Bridges of Königsberg, the three cups problem, and three utilities problem 
**Sangaku (Japanese temple tablets with geometry puzzles)

*A chess problem is a puzzle that uses chess pieces on a chess board. Examples are the knight&#x27;s tour and the eight queens puzzle.
*Mechanical puzzles or dexterity puzzles such as the Rubik&#x27;s Cube and Soma cube can be stimulating toys for children or recreational activities for adults.
**combination puzzles like Peg solitaire
**construction puzzles such as stick puzzles
**disentanglement puzzles,
**folding puzzles
**jigsaw puzzles. Puzz 3D is a three-dimensional variant of this type.
**lock puzzles
**A puzzle box can be used to hide something — jewelry, for instance.
**sliding puzzles (also called sliding tile puzzles) such as the 15 Puzzle and Sokoban
**tiling puzzles like Tangram
**Tower of Hanoi

*Metapuzzles are puzzles which unite elements of other puzzles.
*Paper-and-pencil puzzles such as &quot;Uncle Art&#x27;s Funland&quot;, connect the dots, and nonograms
**Also the logic puzzles published by Nikoli: Sudoku, Slitherlink, Kakuro, Fillomino, Hashiwokakero, Heyawake, Hitori, Light Up, Masyu, Number Link, Nurikabe, Ripple Effect, Shikaku, and Kuromasu; takuzu.
*Spot the difference
*Tour puzzles like a maze
*Word puzzles, including anagrams, ciphers, crossword puzzles, Hangman (game), dropquotes, and word search puzzles. Tabletop and digital word puzzles include Bananagrams, Boggle, Bonza, Dabble, Letterpress (video game), Perquackey, Puzzlage, Quiddler, Ruzzle, Scrabble, Upwords, WordSpot, and Words with Friends. Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show) is a game show centered on a word puzzle.
*Puzzle video games
**Tile-matching video game
**Puzzle-platformer
**Adventure game
**Hidden object game
**Minesweeper

==Puzzle solving==

Solutions of puzzles often require the recognition of patterns and the adherence to a particular kind of order. People with a high level of inductive reasoning aptitude may be better at solving such puzzles compared to others. But puzzles based upon inquiry and discovery may be solved more easily by those with good deduction skills. Deductive reasoning improves with practice. Mathematical puzzles often involve BODMAS. BODMAS is an acronym which stands for Bracket, Of, Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction. In certain regions, PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition and Subtraction) is the synonym of BODMAS. It explains the order of operations to solve an expression. Some mathematical puzzles require top to bottom convention to avoid the ambiguity in the order of operations. It is an elegantly simple idea that relies, as sudoku does, on the requirement that numbers appear only once starting from top to bottom as coming along.

==Puzzle makers==

Puzzle makers are people who make puzzles. In general terms of occupation, a &quot;puzzler&quot; or &quot;puzzlist&quot; is someone who composes and/or solves puzzles.

Some notable creators of puzzles are:

* Ernő Rubik
* Sam Loyd
* Henry Dudeney
* Boris Kordemsky
* Will Shortz
* Oskar van Deventer
* Lloyd King
* Martin Gardner
* Raymond Smullyan

==History of puzzles==

The nine linked-rings puzzle, an advanced puzzle device that requires mathematical calculation to solve, was invented in China during the Warring States period (475-221 BCE). Jigsaw puzzles were invented around 1760, when John Spilsbury, a British engraver and cartographer, mounted a map on a sheet of wood, which he then sawed around the outline of each individual country on the map. He then used the resulting pieces as an aid for the teaching of geography.

After becoming popular among the public, this kind of teaching aid remained the primary use of jigsaw puzzles until about 1820.

The largest puzzle (40,320 pieces) is made by a German game company Ravensburger. The smallest puzzle ever made was created at LaserZentrum Hannover. It is only five square millimeters, the size of a sand grain.

The puzzles that were first documented are riddles. In Europe, Greek mythology produced riddles like the riddle of the Sphinx. Many riddles were produced during the Middle Ages, as well. 

By the early 20th century, magazines and newspapers found that they could increase their readership by publishing puzzle contests, beginning with crosswords and in modern days sudoku.

==Organizations and events==

There are organizations and events that cater to puzzle enthusiasts, such as:

* Nob Yoshigahara Puzzle Design Competition
* World Puzzle Championship
* National Puzzlers&#x27; League
* National Puzzle Day
* Puzzlehunts such as the Maze of Games
*World Cube Association
