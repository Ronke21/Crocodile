<text>The Roman Forum (), also known by its Latin name Forum Romanum, is a rectangular forum (plaza) surrounded by the ruins of several important ancient government buildings at the centre of the city of Rome. Citizens of the ancient city referred to this space, originally a marketplace, as the &#x27;, or simply the&#x27;.

For centuries, the Forum was the centre of day-to-day life in Rome: the site of triumphal processions and elections; the venue for public speeches, criminal trials and gladiatorial matches; and the nucleus of commercial and legal affairs. Here statues and monuments commemorated the city&#x27;s leaders. The heart of ancient Rome, it has been called the most celebrated meeting place in the world, and in all history. Located in the small valley between the Palatine and Capitoline Hills, the Forum today is a sprawling ruin of architectural fragments and intermittent archaeological excavations attracting 4.5 million or more sightseers yearly.

Many of the oldest and most important structures of the ancient city were located on or near the Forum. The Roman Kingdom&#x27;s earliest shrines and temples were located on the southeastern edge. These included the ancient former royal residence, the Regia (8th century BC), and the Temple of Vesta (7th century BC), as well as the surrounding complex of the Vestal Virgins, all of which were rebuilt after the rise of imperial Rome.

Other archaic shrines to the northwest, such as the &quot;Umbilicus Urbis&quot; and the Vulcanal (Shrine of Vulcan), developed into the Republic&#x27;s formal Comitium (assembly area). This was where the Senate—as well as Republican government itself—began. The Senate House, government offices, tribunals, temples, memorials and statues gradually cluttered the area.

Over time, the archaic Comitium was replaced by the larger adjacent Forum, and the focus of judicial activity moved to the new Basilica Aemilia (179 BC), formally Basilica Fulvia. Some 130 years later, Julius Caesar built the Basilica Julia, along with the new Curia Julia, refocusing both the judicial offices and the Senate itself. This new Forum, in what proved to be its final form, then served as a revitalized city square where the people of Rome could gather for commercial, political, judicial and religious pursuits in ever greater numbers.

Eventually, much economic and judicial business would transfer away from the &quot;&quot; to the larger and more extravagant structures (Trajan&#x27;s Forum and the Basilica Ulpia) to the north. The reign of Constantine the Great saw the construction of the last major expansion of the Forum complex—the Basilica of Maxentius (312 AD). This returned the political centre to the Forum until the fall of the Western Roman Empire almost two centuries later.

==Description==
Unlike the later imperial fora in Rome—which were self-consciously modelled on the ancient Greek &quot;plateia&quot; (πλατεῖα) public plaza or town square—the Roman Forum developed gradually, organically, and piecemeal over many centuries. This is the case despite attempts, with some success, to impose some order there, by Sulla, Julius Caesar, Augustus and others. By the Imperial period, the large public buildings that crowded around the central square had reduced the open area to a rectangle of about 130 by 50 meters.

Its long dimension was oriented northwest to southeast and extended from the foot of the Capitoline Hill to that of the Velian Hill. The Forum&#x27;s basilicas during the Imperial period—the Basilica Aemilia on the north and the Basilica Julia on the south—defined its long sides and its final form. The Forum proper included this square, the buildings facing it and, sometimes, an additional area (the &quot;Forum Adjectum&quot;) extending southeast as far as the Arch of Titus.

Originally, the site of the Forum had been a marshy lake where waters from the surrounding hills drained. This was drained by the Tarquins with the Cloaca Maxima. Because of its location, sediments from both the flooding of the Tiber and the erosion of the surrounding hills have been raising the level of the Forum floor for centuries. Excavated sequences of remains of paving show that sediment eroded from the surrounding hills was already raising the level in early Republican times.

As the ground around buildings rose, residents simply paved over the debris that was too much to remove. Its final travertine paving, still visible, dates from the reign of Augustus. Excavations in the 19th century revealed one layer on top of another. The deepest level excavated was 3.60 meters above sea level. Archaeological finds show human activity at that level with the discovery of carbonized wood.

An important function of the Forum, during both Republican and Imperial times, was to serve as the culminating venue for the celebratory military processions known as Triumphs. Victorious generals entered the city by the western Triumphal Gate (Porta Triumphalis) and circumnavigated the Palatine Hill (counterclockwise) before proceeding from the Velian Hill down the Via Sacra and into the Forum.

From here, they would mount the Capitoline Rise (&quot;Clivus Capitolinus&quot;) up to the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the summit of the Capitol. Lavish public banquets ensued back down on the Forum. (In addition to the Via Sacra, the Forum was accessed by several storied roads and streets, including the Vicus Jugarius, Vicus Tuscus, Argiletum, and Via Nova.)

==History==

===Pre-Roman Period===
Pottery deposits discovered in the Forum, Palatine and Capitoline demonstrated that humans occupied these areas in the Final Bronze Age (1200–975 BC). In the early Iron Age an area of the future Forum, close to the site of Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, was used as a cemetery (10th century BC), possibly by the communities based on the Palatine and Capitoline hills. Most of the burials were cremations of the same type which is also found in the other sites in Latium. The urn containing the ashes of the deceased was placed inside a large earthenware jar, along with grave goods, and then buried in a cavity cut into the ground and covered with a capstone. There were also a small number of inhumation burials. On current evidence, it is likely that burials in the Forum ceased in the late 9th century BC and that the Esquiline Necropolis replaced them. 

The first archaeological finds on the sites of the key public buildings point to a transformation of the Forum from a cemetery to a public site in the 8th century BC. Part of the Forum was paved over. The earliest finds in the sites of the Comitium and Vulcanal were votive offerings. They indicate that the area was dedicated to a celebration of religious cults.

===Roman Kingdom===
====Roman historical tradition====

According to Roman historical tradition, the Forum&#x27;s beginnings are connected with the alliance between Romulus, the first king of Rome controlling the Palatine Hill, and his rival, Titus Tatius, who occupied the Capitoline Hill. An alliance formed after combat had been halted by the prayers and cries of the Sabine women. Because the valley lay between the two settlements, it was the designated place for the two peoples to meet. Since the early Forum area included pools of stagnant water, the most easily accessible area was the northern part of the valley which was designated as the Comitium. It was here at the Vulcanal that, according to the story, the two parties laid down their weapons and formed an alliance.

The Forum was outside the walls of the original Sabine fortress, which was entered through the Porta Saturni. These walls were mostly destroyed when the two hills were joined. The original Forum functioned as an open-air market abutting on the Comitium, but eventually outgrew its day-to-day shopping and marketplace role. As political speeches, civil trials, and other public affairs began to take up more and more space in the Forum, additional fora throughout the city began to emerge to expand on specific needs of the growing population. Fora for cattle, pork, vegetables and wine specialised in their niche products and the associated deities.

Rome&#x27;s second king, Numa Pompilius (r. 715–673 BC), is said to have begun the cult of Vesta, building its house and temple as well as the Regia as the city&#x27;s first royal palace. Later Tullus Hostilius (r. 673–642 BC) enclosed the Comitium around the old Etruscan temple where the Senate would meet at the site of the Sabine conflict. He is said to have converted that temple into the Curia Hostilia close to where the Senate originally met in an old Etruscan hut. In 600 BC Tarquinius Priscus had the area paved for the first time.

====Archaeological evidence====

Originally a low-lying, grassy wetland, the Forum was drained in the 7th century BC with the building of the first structures of Cloaca Maxima, a large covered sewer system that emptied into the Tiber, as more people began to settle between the two hills. Archaeological evidence shows that by the end of the 7th century BC, the ground level of the Forum was raised significantly in some places to overcome the problems of poor drainage and provide a foundation for a pebble-paved area. In the middle of the 7th century BC thatch-and-timber huts were demolished on the route of the Via Sacra and rectangular stone buildings began to replace them.

The earliest structures in the Forum were discovered in two separate locations: the site of the Comitium and the group of sanctuaries of Regia (House of the kings), House of the Vestals and Domus Publica. Around 650–630 BC the area of the Comitium was excavated into a deep triangular depression. The area was paved with a beaten earth pavement and later replaced with a more substantial gravel one. Nearby was located an archaic sanctuary dedicated to Vulcan known as Vulcanal (also &quot;Volcanal&quot;): a small rectangular pit and elliptical basin carved out of an outcrop of tuff. It has been suggested that the earliest ancient materials collected in the area of the Vulcanal are from the second half of the 8th century BC. It appears that the Romans were aware of the sites’ archaic origins: the foundation of the Comitium and Vulcanal were attributed to Romulus himself while the first Curia (senate house), which was located nearby, to Tullus Hostilius.

At the western end of the Forum, excavations near the House of the Vestals and the sanctuary of Vesta have revealed an important group of 7th-century-BC buildings. The archaeologists have identified them as the early phases of the Regia (House of the kings), House of the Vestals, and Domus Publica (official residence of the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;). There seems to have been something of a surge in development of the Forum in the last quarter of the 7th century BC, as many of the changes date from 625 to 600 BC. Archaeologically, there is substantial evidence for development of the Forum in the 6th century BC: parts of the paving have been found and a large number of fragments of terracotta decorations from this area suggests that structures around the Forum were becoming more elaborate and highly decorated.

===Roman Republic===


During the Republican period, the Comitium continued to be the central location for all judicial and political life in the city. However, to create a larger gathering place, the Senate began expanding the open area between the Comitium and the Temple of Vesta by purchasing existing private homes and removing them for public use. Building projects of several consuls repaved and built onto both the Comitium and the adjacent central plaza that was becoming the Forum.

The 5th century BC witnessed the earliest Forum temples with known dates of construction: the Temple of Saturn (497 BC) and the Temple of Castor and Pollux (484 BC). The Temple of Concord was added in the following century, possibly by the soldier and statesman Marcus Furius Camillus. A long-held tradition of speaking from the elevated speakers&#x27; Rostra—originally facing north towards the Senate House to the assembled politicians and elites—put the orator&#x27;s back to the people assembled in the Forum. A tribune known as Caius Licinius (consul in 361 BC) is said to have been the first to turn away from the elite towards the Forum, an act symbolically repeated two centuries later by Gaius Gracchus.

This began the tradition of &quot;locus popularis&quot;, in which even young nobles were expected to speak to the people from the Rostra. Gracchus was thus credited with (or accused of) disturbing the &quot;mos maiorum&quot; (&quot;custom of the fathers/ancestors&quot;) in ancient Rome. When Censor in 318 BC, Gaius Maenius provided buildings in the Forum neighborhood with balconies, which were called after him &quot;maeniana&quot;, so that the spectators might better view the games put on within the temporary wooden arenas set up there.

The Tribune benches were placed on the Forum Romanum, as well. First, they stood next to the senate house; during the late Roman Republic, they were placed in front of the Basilica Porcia.

The earliest basilicas (large, aisled halls) were introduced to the Forum in 184 BC by Marcus Porcius Cato, who thus began the process of &quot;monumentalizing&quot; the site. The Basilica Fulvia was dedicated on the north side of the Forum square in 179 BC. (It was rebuilt and renamed several times, as Basilica Fulvia et Aemilia, Basilica Paulli, Basilica Aemilia). Nine years later, the Basilica Sempronia was dedicated on the south side.

Many of the traditions from the Comitium, such as the popular assemblies, funerals of nobles, and games, were transferred to the Forum as it developed. Especially notable was the move of the &quot;comitia tributa&quot;, then the focus of popular politics, in 145 BC. In 133 BC the Tribune Tiberius Gracchus was lynched there by a group of senators.

In the 80s BC, during the dictatorship of Sulla, major work was done on the Forum including the raising of the plaza level by almost a meter and the laying of permanent marble paving stones. Remarkably, this level of the paving was maintained more or less intact for over a millennium: at least until the sack of Rome by Robert Guiscard and his Normans in 1084, when neglect finally allowed debris to begin to accumulate unabated.

In 78 BC, the immense Tabularium (Records Hall) was built at the Capitoline Hill end of the Forum by order of the consuls for that year, M. Aemilius Lepidus and Q. Lutatius Catulus. In 63 BC, Cicero delivered his famous speech denouncing the companions of the conspirator Catiline at the Forum (in the Temple of Concord, whose spacious hall was sometimes used as a meeting place by the Senators). After the verdict, they were led to their deaths at the Tullianum, the nearby dungeon which was the only known state prison of the ancient Romans.

Over time, the Comitium was lost to the ever-growing Curia and to Julius Caesar&#x27;s rearrangements before his assassination in 44 BC. That year, two events were witnessed by the Forum, perhaps the most famous ever to transpire there: Marc Antony&#x27;s funeral oration for Caesar (immortalized in Shakespeare&#x27;s famous play) was delivered from the partially completed speaker&#x27;s platform known as the New Rostra and the public burning of Caesar&#x27;s body occurred on a site directly across from the Rostra around which the Temple to the Deified Caesar was subsequently built by his great-nephew Octavius (Augustus). Almost two years later, Marc Antony added to the notoriety of the Rostra by publicly displaying the severed head and right hand of his enemy Cicero there.

===Roman Empire===

After Julius Caesar&#x27;s death and the end of the subsequent civil war, Augustus finished his great-uncle&#x27;s work, giving the Forum its final form. This included the southeastern end of the plaza where he constructed the Temple of Caesar and the Arch of Augustus there (both in 29 BC). The Temple of Caesar was placed between Caesar&#x27;s funeral pyre and the Regia. The Temple&#x27;s location and reconstruction of adjacent structures resulted in greater organization akin to the Forum of Caesar. The Forum was also witness to the assassination of a Roman Emperor in 69 AD: Galba had set out from the palace to meet rebels but was so feeble that he had to be carried in a litter. He was immediately met by a troop of his rival Otho&#x27;s cavalry near the &quot;Lacus Curtius&quot; in the Forum, where he was killed.

During these early Imperial times, much economic and judicial business transferred away from the Forum to larger and more extravagant structures to the north. After the building of Trajan&#x27;s Forum (110 AD), these activities transferred to the Basilica Ulpia.
The white marble Arch of Septimius Severus was added at the northwest end of the Forum close to the foot of the Capitoline Hill and adjacent to the old, vanishing Comitium. It was dedicated in 203 AD to commemorate the Parthian victories of Emperor Septimius Severus and his two sons against Pescennius Niger and is one of the most visible landmarks there today. The arch closed the Forum&#x27;s central area. Besides the Arch of Augustus, which was also constructed following a Roman victory against the Parthians, it is the only triumphal arch in the Forum. The Emperor Diocletian (r. 284–305) was the last of the great builders of Rome&#x27;s city infrastructure and he did not omit the Forum from his program. By his day it had become highly cluttered with honorific memorials. He refurbished and reorganized it, building anew the Temple of Saturn, the Temple of Vesta and the Curia Julia. The latter represents the best-preserved tetrarchic building in Rome. He also reconstructed the rostra at each end of the Forum and added columns.

The reign of Constantine the Great saw the completion of the construction of the Basilica of Maxentius (312 AD), the last significant expansion of the Forum complex. This restored much of the political focus to the Forum until the fall of the Western Roman Empire almost two centuries later.

===Medieval===

After the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, and the resulting Gothic Wars between the Byzantine / Eastern Roman Empire and the Ostrogoths over Italia, much of the city of Rome fell into ruin, from famine, warfare, and lack of authority. The population of Rome was reduced from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands, as the populated areas contracted to the river, largely abandoning the forum. Strenuous efforts were made to keep the Forum (and the Palatine structures) intact, not without some success. In the 6th century, some of the old edifices within the Forum began to be transformed into Christian churches. On 1 August 608, the Column of Phocas, a Roman monumental column, was erected before the Rostra and dedicated or rededicated in honour of the Eastern Roman Emperor Phocas. This proved to be the last monumental addition made to the Forum. The emperor Constans II, who visited the city in 663 AD, stripped the lead roofs of the monumental buildings, exposing the structures to the weather and hastening their deterioration. By the 8th century, the whole space was surrounded by Christian churches taking the place of abandoned and ruined temples.

An anonymous eighth-century Einsiedeln Itinerary reports that the Forum was already falling apart at that time. During the Middle Ages, though the memory of the &quot;&quot; persisted, its monuments were for the most part buried under debris, and its location was designated the &quot;Campo Vaccino&quot; or &quot;cattle field,&quot; located between the Capitoline Hill and the Colosseum.

After the eighth century, the structures of the Forum were dismantled, rearranged, and used to build towers and castles within the local area. In the 13th century, these rearranged structures were torn down and the site became a dumping ground. This, along with the debris from the dismantled medieval buildings and ancient structures, helped contribute to the rising ground level.

The return of Pope Urban V from Avignon in 1367 led to an increased interest in ancient monuments, partly for their moral lesson and partly as a quarry for new buildings being undertaken in Rome after a long lapse.

===Renaissance===
The Forum Romanum suffered some of its worst depredations during the Italian Renaissance, particularly in the decade between 1540 and 1550, when Pope Paul III exploited it intensively for material to build the new Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Just a few years before, in 1536, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V held a triumph in Rome on his return from conquering Tunis in North Africa. To prepare the Forum for the procession intended to imitate the pageantry of the ancient Roman triumph, the papal authorities undertook sweeping demolitions of the many medieval structures on the site, to reveal and better display the ancient monuments. This required the clearance of some 200 houses and several churches, the excavation of a new &quot;Via Sacra&quot; to pass under the arches of Titus and Septimius Severus, and the excavation of the more prominent monuments to reveal their foundations.

In 1425, Pope Martin V issued a papal bull inaugurating a campaign of civic improvement and rebuilding in the city, which was depopulated and dominated by ruins. The demand for building materials consequently increased significantly, making the Forum a convenient quarry for stone and marble.

Since the 12th century, when Rome&#x27;s civic government was formed, responsibility for protecting the ruins of the forum fell to the &quot;maestri di strade&quot; under the authority of the Conservatori, Rome&#x27;s senior magistrates. Historically, the &quot;maestri&quot; and the &quot;Conservatori&quot; saw themselves as guardians of Rome&#x27;s ancient legacy and zealously protected the ruins in the Forum from further destruction, but in the 15th century the Papacy gradually encroached upon these prerogatives. The Bull of 1425 strengthened the powers of the &quot;maestri&quot; in protecting the ruins, but in conferring papal authority the Vatican essentially brought the &quot;maestri&quot; under its control and away from the independence of the Conservators.

In the 15th century, the Vatican escalated the issuance of excavation licenses, which gave broad permission to individuals to mine specific sites or structures for stone. In 1452, the ability of the &quot;maestri&quot; to issue their own excavation licenses was revoked by the Bull of Pope Nicholas V, which absorbed that power into the Vatican. From then on only two authorities in Rome had the power to issue such licenses: the Vatican and the Conservators. This dual, overlapping authority was recognized in 1462 by a Bull of Pope Pius II.
Within the context of these disputes over jurisdiction, ruins in the forum were increasingly exploited and stripped. In 1426, a papal license authorized the destruction of the foundations of a structure called the &quot;Templum Canapare&quot; for burning into lime, provided that half the stone quarried be shared with the Apostolic Camera (the Papal treasury). This structure was identified by Rodolfo Lanciani as the Basilica Julia, but the name could have applied to any structure in the western section of the Forum, often called the &quot;Canapare&quot; or &quot;Cannapara&quot;. Between 1431 and 1462 the huge travertine wall between the Senate House and the Forum of Caesar adjoining the Forum Romanum was demolished by a grant of Pope Eugene IV, followed by the demolition of the &quot;Templum Sacrae Urbis&quot; (1461–1462), the Temple of Venus and Roma (1450), and the House of the Vestals (1499), all by papal license. The worst destruction in the forum occurred under Paul III, who in 1540 revoked previous excavation licenses and brought the forum exclusively under the control of the Deputies of the Fabric of the new Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica, who exploited the site for stone and marble. Monuments which fell victim to dismantling and the subsequent burning of their materials for lime included the remains of the Arch of Augustus, the Temple of Caesar, parts of the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, the Temple of Vesta, the steps and foundation of the Temple of Castor and Pollux, and the Regia. The Conservators protested vehemently against the ruination of their heritage, as they perceived it, and on one occasion applied fruitlessly to Pope Gregory XIII (1572–1585) to revoke all licenses for foraging materials, including the one granted to the &quot;fabbrica&quot; of Saint Peter&#x27;s in the forum.

===Excavation and preservation===

The excavation by Carlo Fea, who began clearing the debris from the Arch of Septimius Severus in 1803 marked the beginning of clearing the Forum. Excavations were officially begun in 1898 by the Italian government under the Minister of Public Instruction, Dr. Baccelli. The 1898, restoration had three main objectives: restore fragmented pieces of columns, bases, and cornices to their original locations in the Forum, reach the lowest possible level of the Forum without damaging existing structures, and to identify already half-excavated structures, along with the Senate house and Basilica Aemilia. These state-funded excavations were led by Dr. Giacomo Boni until he died in 1925, stopping briefly during World War I.

In 2008, heavy rains caused structural damage to the modern concrete covering holding the &quot;Black Stone&quot; marble together over the Lapis Niger in Rome. Excavations in the Forum continue, with discoveries by archaeologists working in the Forum since 2009 leading to questions about Rome&#x27;s exact age. One of these recent discoveries includes a tuff wall near the Lapis Niger used to channel water from nearby aquifers. Around the wall, pottery remains and food scraps allowed archaeologists to date the likely construction of the wall to the 8th or 9th century BC, over a century before the traditional date of Rome&#x27;s founding.

In 2020, Italian archaeologists discovered a sarcophagus and a circular altar dating to the 6th century BC. Experts disagree whether it is a memorial tomb dedicated to Rome&#x27;s legendary founder, Romulus.

===Temple of Saturn===

The Temple of Saturn was one of the more significant buildings located in the Roman Forum. Little is known about when the temple was built, as the original temple is believed to have been burnt down by the Gauls early in the fourth century. However, it is understood that it was also rebuilt by Munatius Plancus in 42 BC. The eight remaining columns are all that is left of the illustrious temple. Though its exact date of completion is not known, it stands as one of the oldest buildings in the Forum. The temple originally was to be built to the god Jupiter but was replaced with Saturn; historians are unsure why. The building was not used solely for religious practice; the temple also functioned as a bank for Roman society.

The Temple stood in the forum along with four other temples, the temples of Concord, Vesta, Castor and Pollox. At each temple, animal sacrifices and rituals were done in front of the religious sites. These acts were meant to provide good fortune to those entering and using the temple. Since the Temple of Saturn also functioned as a bank, and since Saturn was the god of the Golden Age, sacrifices were made there in the hope of financial success.

Inside the Temple, there were multiple vaults for the public and private ones for individuals. There were also sections of the Temple for public speaking events and feasts which often followed the sacrifices.

==In art==

From the 17th through the 19th century, the Roman Forum was a site for many artists and architects studying in Rome to sketch. The focus of many of these works produced by visiting Northern artists was on the current state of the Roman Forum, known locally as the Campo Vaccino, or &quot;cow field&quot;, from the livestock who grazed on the largely ignored section of the city. Claude Lorrain&#x27;s 1636 &quot;Campo Vaccino&quot; shows the extent to which the buildings in the Forum were buried under sediment. Renowned British artist J. M. W. Turner painted &quot;Modern Rome – Campo Vaccino&quot; in 1839, following his final trip to the city.
The Roman Forum has been a source of inspiration for visual artists for centuries. Especially notable is Giovanni Battista Piranesi, who created a set of 135 etchings, the &quot;Vedute di Roma&quot; (&quot;Views of Rome&quot;), in which the Forum figured significantly. (Many of the features documented in Piranesi&#x27;s views have now vanished.)

Other notable artists of the Forum include Canaletto, Maerten van Heemskerck, Pirro Ligorio, Giovanni Paolo Panini, and Hubert Robert.

==Other fora in Rome==
Other fora existed in other areas of the city; remains of most of them, sometimes substantial, still exist. The most important of these are several large imperial fora forming a complex with the Forum Romanum: the &quot;Forum Iulium&quot;, &quot;Forum Augustum&quot;, the &quot;Forum Transitorium&quot; (also: &quot;Forum Nerva&quot;), and Trajan&#x27;s Forum. The planners of the Mussolini era removed most of the medieval and Baroque strata and built the Via dei Fori Imperiali road between the Imperial Fora and the Forum. There are also:
* The &quot;Forum Boarium&quot;, dedicated to the commerce of cattle, between the Palatine Hill and the river Tiber,
* The &quot;Forum Holitorium&quot;, dedicated to the commerce of herbs and vegetables, between the Capitoline Hill and the Servian walls,
* The &quot;Forum Piscarium&quot;, dedicated to the commerce of fish, between the Capitoline hill and the Tiber, in the area of the current Roman Ghetto,
* The &quot;Forum Suarium&quot;, dedicated to the commerce of pork, near the barracks of the cohortes urbanae in the northern part of the Campus Martius,
* The &quot;Forum Vinarium&quot;, dedicated to the commerce of wine, in the area now of the &quot;quartiere&quot; Testaccio, between Aventine Hill and the Tiber.

Other markets were known but remain unidentifiable due to a lack of precise information on each site&#x27;s function.

<doc id="92896" wikidata="Q7362357" url="?curid=92896" title="Romana (Doctor Who)">
<text>Romana, short for Romanadvoratrelundar (), is a fictional character in the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. A Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, she is a companion to the Fourth Doctor.

As a Time Lord, Romana is able to regenerate, having had two on-screen incarnations with somewhat different personalities (dubbed Romana I and Romana II by fans). Romana I was played by Mary Tamm from 1978 to 1979. When Tamm chose not to sign on for a second season, the part was recast. Romana II was played by Lalla Ward from 1979 to 1981. A third incarnation of Romana has been depicted in some of the spin-off novels, and a fourth (performed by Juliet Landau) has been featured in several audio dramas released by Big Finish Productions in 2013 and 2014, and appeared again in early 2015.

Romana is one of only two companions from the Doctor&#x27;s home planet, Gallifrey, to travel with him in the original television series. The first was his granddaughter Susan Foreman.

==Romana I==
The White Guardian originally assigns Romana to assist the Doctor during the quest for the Key to Time, a series of linked serials which constitute the whole of Season 16 (1978–79). Romana first appears in &quot;The Ribos Operation&quot;, and was intended as a contrast to her predecessor, the savage Leela. Romana is initially haughty and somewhat arrogant, looking down on the Doctor (whom she considers to be her academic inferior) and responding to his initial resentment at her presence with icy put-downs. However, she soon gains an appreciation for the Doctor&#x27;s experience and sense of adventure, and begins to respect him as a teacher.

Over the course of Season 16, Romana begins to take on some of the characteristics of the screaming &quot;damsel in distress&quot;, which reinforced Tamm&#x27;s decision not to remain in the role as she felt the character had been taken as far as she could go. As a result, Romana regenerates at the start of Season 17, emerging with a different physical appearance and a lighter personality.

Although Tamm had left the show on relatively good terms and was willing to film a regeneration sequence for the start of Season 17, she was not invited to do so. There was a rumour, purportedly started by former producer John Nathan-Turner, that the real reason Tamm left was that she was pregnant. Tamm has denied this repeatedly over the years.

==Romana II==

The introduction of Romana&#x27;s second incarnation at the start of &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot; — a script credited to Terry Nation, but with several additions and alterations by script editor Douglas Adams — treats the concept of regeneration humorously; Romana changes bodily forms several times, rather like someone casually trying on different outfits, before deciding to take the form of Princess Astra, who had been played by Lalla Ward in the final serial of Season 16, &quot;The Armageddon Factor&quot;. This regeneration scene is controversial with some fans, as it does not conform to the seriousness with which regeneration is presented in most other cases. It is generally presented as traumatic, even emotionally or physically agonizing. Attempts at rationalising Romana&#x27;s regeneration have been made in licensed spin-off media, including the &quot;Short Trips&quot; short story &quot;The Lying Old Witch in the Wardrobe&quot; which speculates that the TARDIS was responsible for her regeneration.

At the end of the serial &quot;Meglos&quot;, Romana receives word from the Time Lords recalling her to Gallifrey. The opening of the next serial &quot;Full Circle&quot; makes it clear that, having travelled with the Doctor, she no longer desires to return home. Before the issue can be resolved, the TARDIS falls through a &quot;charged vacuum emboîtement&quot; and disappears into another universe known as E-Space. Her final television appearance was in the 1981 story &quot;Warriors&#x27; Gate&quot; where, along with the robot dog K9, she leaves to forge her own path in E-space when faced with a choice of remaining there or returning to Gallifrey. She also appears briefly in the 20th Anniversary special &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983) through the reuse of footage from the uncompleted 1979 story &quot;Shada&quot;, as Tom Baker declined to appear in the special.

After the departure of both Romana I and II, both versions of the character also appeared very briefly in flashback sequences during the Fourth Doctor&#x27;s regeneration in &quot;Logopolis&quot; as well as the Fifth Doctor&#x27;s mind-copy in &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot;. Romana would also be mentioned in &quot;Castrovalva&quot; during the Fifth Doctor&#x27;s post-regenerative confusion, as well as in &quot;Arc of Infinity&quot;, in which the Fifth Doctor, in response to a reprimand from the High Council of Time Lords for &quot;leaving [her] behind&quot;, retorts that she &quot;chose to remain in E-Space&quot;. Ward subsequently returned for a brief cameo as Romana in the 1993 charity special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;.

==Appearances in other media==
Outside of the television programme, the Fourth Doctor and Romana II also appear in Australian-filmed television advertisements for PR1ME Computer, Inc. in 1980, which played in a tongue-in-cheek way with the idea that the two characters shared a romantic relationship, climaxing with the Doctor proposing marriage (which occurred in real life between Tom Baker and Lalla Ward after her departure from the series that same year).

An article by Russell T Davies in the &quot;Doctor Who Annual 2006&quot; states that Romana was President of the Time Lords during the Last Great Time War against the Daleks (see below), which ended with Gallifrey being destroyed. As with all spin-off media, its canonicity in relation to the television series is debatable.

===Novels===
In the licensed Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;Blood Harvest&quot; by Terrance Dicks, Romana II leaves E-Space and returns to Gallifrey with the help of the Seventh Doctor. In &quot;Goth Opera&quot; by Paul Cornell, from the complementary Missing Adventures series, she is given a seat on the High Council of Time Lords. In New Adventures&#x27; &quot;Happy Endings&quot;, also by Cornell, it is revealed that Romana has become Lady President of Gallifrey. Romana&#x27;s presidency is reflected in the later novels and in her appearances (voiced by Ward) in audio dramas from Big Finish Productions. She also makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Human Nature&quot; in a vision. Romana appears in the unlicensed fan fiction novel &quot;Time&#x27;s Champion&quot;, in the role of President of the Time Lords.

Romana&#x27;s appearance in the 1997 novel &quot;The Eight Doctors&quot;- where she helps the newly regenerated Eighth Doctor rescue his fourth incarnation from a group of vampires in the aftermath of &quot;State of Decay&quot;- was highlighted in a trailer for the re-launched &quot;Doctor Who&quot; range which was included on a number of BBC videos in 1997–8. The trailer used a clip from &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot; to illustrate Romana.

Romana&#x27;s time with the Doctor is also explored in several novels, which include additional adventures for her first incarnation when outside forces divert their efforts to find the Key to Time and general adventures for her second incarnation prior to departing in E-space.

====Romana III====

In the BBC Books Eighth Doctor Adventures novels, Romana undergoes a second regeneration, and her new incarnation (Romana III, whose appearance was modelled on silent movie actress Louise Brooks) is far less sympathetic and far more ruthless than the other two. This third incarnation pursues the Eighth Doctor in a story arc relating to the Future War, a War between the Time Lords and an as-yet-unidentified enemy, seeking to use his new companion Compassion – who has been unintentionally mutated into a Type 102 TARDIS in the aftermath of the destruction of the Doctor&#x27;s own ship – as breeding stock for the new sentient TARDISes in the Future War. With the Doctor refusing to allow the Time Lords to make Compassion a slave, he, Compassion and fellow companion Fitz Kreiner go on the run between &quot;The Shadows of Avalon&quot; and &quot;The Ancestor Cell&quot;, the final confrontation on board the Doctor&#x27;s believed-destroyed original TARDIS resulting in the obliteration of Gallifrey and the apparent retroactive wiping out of the Time Lords from history. A flashback in the final Eighth Doctor Adventures novel &quot;The Gallifrey Chronicles&quot; suggests that Romana is killed by Faction Paradox skulltroopers just before Gallifrey&#x27;s destruction. However, it is hinted in &quot;Tomb of Valdemar&quot; by Simon Messingham that Romana may be one of a few Time Lords who survived this cataclysm, possibly in a fourth incarnation and &quot;The Gallifrey Chronicles&quot; itself suggests that the Doctor will eventually restore Gallifrey and all the dead Time Lords whose minds are stored in the Matrix, in time for its destruction again in the Time War.

===Audio plays===

Romana II appeared pseudonymously in a series of audio plays produced in the early 2000s by BBV. In this series, Lalla Ward played a character who appeared with K9 in an unnamed parallel universe. This character is called the Mistress (which was what K9 called Romana in the television series). Because of an unusual copyright situation in which BBV was able to license K9 but not Romana or other &quot;Doctor Who&quot; elements, the Mistress is not explicitly called Romana. For similar reasons, the parallel universe (obviously intended to reflect Romana&#x27;s exile in E-Space) is called a &quot;pocket universe&quot; in the series&#x27; packaging.

In Big Finish&#x27;s regular line of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio stories, Ward joined Colin Baker&#x27;s Sixth Doctor in &quot;The Apocalypse Element&quot;, in which Romana is Lady President of Gallifrey. In the story, it is revealed that Romana II was abducted by the Daleks soon after assuming the presidential office, and remained in captivity for twenty years before making her escape, briefly reuniting with the Doctor before reassuming her post. Romana II also appears with Paul McGann&#x27;s Eighth Doctor in the 2003 remake of &quot;Shada&quot;, an audio play produced by Big Finish for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; website and accompanied by Macromedia Flash animations, and also in &quot;Neverland&quot; and &quot;Zagreus&quot;. More recently, she has appeared with the Fifth Doctor in &quot;The Chaos Pool&quot;, the final part of the &quot;Key 2 Time&quot; trilogy, where it is revealed that Romana&#x27;s regeneration was at least partly caused by her transformation into the new sixth segment of the Key to Time, the audio concluding with the segment&#x27;s essence being transferred back to Astra to save Romana&#x27;s life before the Doctor destroys the Key for good.

In &quot;Neverland&quot; Romana encounters the Eighth Doctor as Anti-Time infects the Universe. With other Time Lords she travels to the Anti-Verse in the hope of finding a way to stop the flow of Anti-Time. But there she is left by Co-ordinator Vansell to the Neverpeople, those the Time Lords have erased from existence, who are planning to send Anti-Time to Gallifrey. However she helps the Doctor activate the TARDIS and stop the Anti-Time. In the sequel to this &quot;Zagreus&quot;, Romana II is forced to banish the Eighth Doctor from the universe as he has become a danger to it following his infection by the forces of &quot;anti-time&quot;. Following on from this, she is featured in a number of audio plays with former Doctor companion Leela (played by Louise Jameson) under the umbrella title of &quot;Gallifrey&quot;.

In the audio series, Romana has to contend with the emergence of a terrorist group known as Free Time, which wants to break the technological monopoly on time travel and threatens not just Gallifrey, but its time travel-capable allies. Romana&#x27;s progressive policies, including opening the academy to non-Gallifreyans, also face opposition from more conservative elements. Complicating this is the escape of an ancient evil called Pandora from the Matrix in the paradoxical form of Romana&#x27;s first incarnation (played once again by Mary Tamm). Both Romana and the Pandora entity proclaim themselves Imperiatrix of Gallifrey, provoking a civil war. At the war&#x27;s end, Romana destroys Pandora by trapping her in the Matrix and destroying it. She is also removed from the Presidency. With Gallifrey on the brink of economic and social collapse, as well as in danger of being overrun by a Free Time virus, Romana and her friends flee through several alternate universes. Romana encounters many versions of Gallifrey worse than her own, before finally becoming trapped in one. This Gallifrey is similar, but without the ability to time travel. After their President Romana is assassinated, she assumes her identity, regaining her office, albeit in a different universe. She is eventually able to return to her universe with a cure for the Free Time virus, although the audios then lead into early strikes by the Daleks that are apparently intended to foreshadow the Time War.

Big Finish&#x27;s spin-off line &quot;The Companion Chronicles&quot; has featured new performances by both Ward and Tamm in a number of stories set within their respective continuities.

Tamm reprised the role of Romana for the final time alongside Tom Baker for a second series of original audio dramas (the first series having featured Leela) set after the Key to Time era. Recorded several months before Tamm&#x27;s death in 2012, the first of these, &quot;The Auntie Matter&quot;, was released in January 2013, with a total of seven plays being released up until July 2013.
In July 2013 it was announced that Juliet Landau would play a future incarnation of Romana for Big Finish. This version of Romana was introduced in &quot;Renaissance&quot;, the third chapter of &quot;Gallifrey VI&quot;, released in October 2013, and was said to come from thousands of years in the future. This version of Romana was later reprised by Landau in the January 2014 audio drama &quot;Luna Romana&quot;, part of Big Finish&#x27;s &quot;Companion Chronicles&quot; line; Landau also performs the role of Romana I in lieu of the now-deceased Mary Tamm in this story, the narrative intending to present Landau&#x27;s Romana as looking back on the events of her first incarnation&#x27;s travels with the Doctor. To avoid confusion with her earlier self, this future Romana volunteers to use the name Lady Trey (taken from one of the middle syllables of her full name). Landau returned to the role once again in &quot;Gallifrey: Intervention Earth&quot;, a continuation of the &quot;Gallifrey&quot; series released in January 2015. This story is revealed in the follow-up &quot;Enemy Lines&quot; to depict what happens shortly after Ward&#x27;s incarnation is forced to regenerate and sees Gallifrey on the brink of another war. However Irving Braxiatel prevents the regeneration so that these events, including the very existence of the Landau incarnation, are undone.

In November 2013 it was revealed that Lalla Ward would reprise her role of Romana II alongside former Fourth Doctor Tom Baker and John Leeson as K9 in a pair of audio adaptations of Gareth Roberts Missing Adventure novels &quot;The Romance of Crime&quot; and &quot;The English Way of Death&quot; in January 2015, to be followed by at a series of new adventures in 2016 and another in 2017. Lalla Ward also returned as Romana II in &quot;Gallifrey: Enemy Lines&quot; in 2016, &quot;Gallifrey: Time War I&quot; in 2018, &quot;Gallifrey: Time War II&quot; in 2019, &quot;Gallifrey: Time War III&quot; in 2020, and &quot;Gallifrey: Time War IV&quot; in 2021. As well as Gallifrey Romana II also featured in a series set while travelling with the Doctor and Adric in E-Space, the Lost Story &quot;The Doomsday Contract&quot;, and &quot;The Eighth of March 2: Protectors of Time&quot;.

== Incarnations ==

During the opening of &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot;, three momentary incarnations of Romanain the plot&#x27;s transition from the Tamm incarnation to the Ward incarnationwere played by uncredited actresses Maggie Armitage, Yvonne Gallagher and Lee Richards.

<text>Viterbo (; Viterbese: ; ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in the Lazio region of Italy, the capital of the province of Viterbo.

It conquered and absorbed the neighboring town of Ferento (see Ferentium) in its early history. It is approximately north of GRA (Rome) on the Via Cassia, and it is surrounded by the Monti Cimini and Monti Volsini. The historic center is surrounded by the medieval walls of Viterbo, which are still mainly intact, built during the 11th and 12th centuries. Entrance to the walled center of the city is through ancient gates.

Apart from agriculture, Viterbo&#x27;s main resources are pottery, peperino stone, and wood. The town is home to the Italian gold reserves, an important Academy of Fine Arts, the University of Tuscia, and the Italian Army&#x27;s Aviation Command headquarters and training centre. It is located in a wide thermal area, attracting many tourists from all over central Italy.

==History==
The first report of the new city dates to the eighth century AD, when it is identified as &quot;Castrum Viterbii&quot;. It was fortified in 773 by the Lombard King Desiderius in his vain attempt to conquer Rome. When the popes switched to the Frankish support, Viterbo became part of the Papal States. Still, this status was to be highly contested by the emperors in the following centuries, until 1095 when it was known as a free &quot;comune&quot; (municipality).
In a period in which the popes had difficulties asserting their authority over Rome, Viterbo became their favourite residence, beginning with Pope Eugene III (1145–1146) who was besieged in vain in the city walls. In 1164, Frederick Barbarossa made Viterbo the seat of his antipope Paschal III. Three years later, he called it a &quot;city&quot; and used its militias against Rome. In 1172, Viterbo started its expansion, destroying the old city of &quot;Ferento&quot; and conquering other lands. In this age it was a rich and prosperous &quot;comune&quot;, one of the most important of Central Italy, with a population of almost 60,000.

In 1207, Pope Innocent III held a council in the cathedral, but the city was later excommunicated as the favourite seat of the heretical Patarines and even defeated by the Romans. In 1210, however, Viterbo managed to defeat Emperor Otto IV and was again at war against Rome.

In the thirteenth century it was ruled alternately by the tyrants of the Gatti and Di Vico families. Frederick II drew Viterbo to the Ghibelline side in 1240, but when the citizens expelled his turbulent German troops in 1243 he returned and besieged the city, but in vain. From that point Viterbo was always a loyal Guelph city. Between 1257 and 1261 it was the seat of Pope Alexander IV, who also died there. His successor Urban IV was elected in Viterbo.

In 1266–1268, Clement IV chose Viterbo as the base of his ruthless fight against the Hohenstaufen. Here, from the loggia of the Papal Palace, he excommunicated the army of Conradin of Swabia which was passing on the Via Cassia, with the prophetical motto of the &quot;lamb who is going to the sacrifice&quot;. Other popes elected in Viterbo were Gregory X (1271) and John XXI (1276) (who died in the papal palace when the ceiling of the recently built library collapsed on him while he slept), Nicholas III and the French Martin IV. The Viterbese, who did not agree with the election of a foreigner directed by the King of Naples, Charles I of Anjou, invaded the cathedral where the conclave was held, arresting two of the cardinals. They were subsequently excommunicated, and the popes avoided Viterbo for 86 years.

Without the popes, the city fell into the hands of the Di Vicos. In the fourteenth century, Giovanni di Vico had created a seignory extending to Civitavecchia, Tarquinia, Bolsena, Orvieto, Todi, Narni and Amelia. His dominion was crushed by Cardinal Gil de Albornoz in 1354, sent by the Avignonese popes to recover the Papal States, who built the castle. In 1375, the city gave its keys to Francesco Di Vico, son of the previous tyrant, but thirteen years later the people killed him and assigned the city first to Pope Urban VI, and then to Giovanni di Sciarra di Vico, Francesco&#x27;s cousin. But Pope Boniface IX&#x27;s troops drove him away in 1396 and established a firm papal suzerainty over the city. The last Di Vico to hold power in Viterbo was Giacomo, who was defeated in 1431.

Thenceforth Viterbo became a city of secondary importance, following the vicissitudes of the Papal States. In the 16th century it was the birthplace of Latino Latini. It became part of Italy in 1871.

In 1927 Viterbo was made a provincial capital.

 During World War II Viterbo was occupied by the Wehrmacht after the Armistice of Cassibile and heavily bombed by the Allies, suffering over twenty raids between July 1943 and June 1944; this left a third of the city destroyed or badly damaged, and caused heavy damage to cultural heritage and 1,017 civilian deaths. On 20 March 2024, an unexploded MK IV Bomb was found in a construction site causing an evacuation of more than 30,000 people in a range of 1400m until the bomb could be disposed of.

The annual precipitation is , of which November is the wettest with , while July is the driest with only .

=== Places of interest ===
Viterbo&#x27;s historic center is one of the best preserved medieval towns of central Italy. Many of the older buildings (particularly churches) are built on top of ancient ruins, recognizable by their large stones, 50 centimeters to a side. Viterbo is unique in Italy for its concentration of &#x27;profferli&#x27;, external staircases that were a frequent feature of medieval houses. The San Pellegrino quarter has an abundance of them, reflecting an architectural style that is unique to the town and the nearby region.

* Palazzo dei Papi or Papal Palace: main attraction of Viterbo, the palace hosted the papacy for about two decades in the 13th century, and served as a country residence or refuge in time of trouble in Rome. The columns of the palace are &quot;spolia&quot; from a Roman temple.
* Cathedral of San Lorenzo: Cathedral or duomo was originally erected as episcopal see of the exempt bishopric of Viterbo in Romanesque style by Lombard architects at the site of an ancient Roman temple of Hercules. It was rebuilt from the sixteenth century on, and heavily damaged in 1944 by Allied bombs. The Gothic belfry was built in the first half of the 14th century, and shows influence of Sienese architects. The church houses the sarcophagus of Pope John XXI and a picture &quot;Christ Blessing&quot; (1472) by Girolamo da Cremona.
* Palazzo Comunale (town hall; begun 1460), Palazzo del Podestà (magistrate&#x27;s residence; 1264) and Palazzo della Prefettura (police HQ; rebuilt 1771): three civic buildings around the central square, Piazza del Plebiscito. The Palazzo Comunale houses a series of 17th century and Baroque frescoes by Tarquinio Ligustri, Bartolomeo Cavarozzi and Ludovico Nucci.
* Sant&#x27;Andrea Apostolo: a Romanesque-style, Roman Catholic church
* Santa Maria della Peste: a small 16th-century temple-church (&quot;tempietto&quot;)
* Santa Maria della Salute: a small Gothic church with a highly decorated portal 
* Palazzo Farnese: 14th–15th-century palace was the childhood home of Alessandro Farnese, the future Pope Paul III, and his beautiful sister, Giulia Farnese.
* Palazzo Gatti: 13th-century Gothic architecture palace.
* Palazzo Mazzatosta: 13th-century aristocratic palace.
*&quot;Rocca&quot; (castle)
* Santa Maria Nuova (11th-century), San Sisto (second half of 9th-century), and San Giovanni in Zoccoli (11th-century): three Romanesque churches.
* Palazzo degli Alessandri: a typical medieval patrician house in central Viterbo
* Fontana di Piano Scarano: medieval fountain inside Viterbo city walls
* Fontana di Piazza della Rocca: public fountain in the center of the Old Town, construction 12th–16th century
* Fontana Grande: public fountain, construction began in 1206.
* San Francesco: gothic church built over a pre-existing Lombard fortress. It has a single nave with a Latin cross plan. It houses the sepulchre of Pope Adrian V, who died in Viterbo in 1276, considered the first monument by Arnolfo di Cambio.
* Sanctuary of Santa Rosa: church is a sober 19th-century reconstruction, where every year a new Macchina di Santa Rosa, or dedicatory tower is displayed.

* Museo Civico: City museum for arecheologic items from the pre-historic to Ancient Roman times, and a Pinacoteca (picture gallery) with works by Sebastiano del Piombo, Antoniazzo Romano, Salvator Rosa, Antiveduto Grammatica and others. 
* Orto Botanico dell&#x27;Università della Tuscia: botanical garden operated by the university.

====Baths of Viterbo====

In the valley of the Arcione River just to the west of Viterbo are a number of springs celebrated for the healing qualities of their waters, and in use since Etruscan and Roman days. In fact, the imposing ruins of a great Roman bath are still to be seen and were drawn in plan and perspective by Renaissance artists including Giuliano da Sangallo, Michelangelo, and Vasari. One of the most famous were the thermal springs known as the &quot;Bullicame&quot;, or bubbling place, whose reputation had even reached the ears of the exiled poet Dante Alighieri. Canto 14 (lines 79–81) of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; describes how:

&lt;poem&gt;
In silence we had reached a place where flowed
a slender watercourse out of the wood—a stream
whose redness makes me shudder still.
As from the Bullicame pours a brook whose
waters are then shared by prostitutes, so did this
stream run down across the sand.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Not far from the Bullicame, whose waters were apparently always taken in the open, is the Terme dei Papi (&quot;Bath of the Popes&quot;). Almost totally concealed within the structure of a modern luxury spa hotel are the remains of a Renaissance bath palace that attracted the attention of two popes. Actually, the origins of this bathing establishment date to the Middle Ages when it was known as the Bagno della Crociata (named either after a Crusader who supposedly discovered the spring or from a corruption of the Italian word for crutch). Early 15th-century documents describe a bath building that covered three distinct thermal springs all under one roof.
This bath house was transformed circa 1454 by the Pope Nicholas V, who commissioned a bath palace (according to Nicholas&#x27;s biographer, Giannozzo Manetti) &quot;with such magnificence and with such expense that it was not only deemed suitable for a stay and salutary for the sick but seemed an edifice destined to have rooms fit for princes and for living regally&quot;. A more precise description of Pope Nicholas&#x27; palace was described by the Viterbese chronicler Niccola della Tuccia in the 1470s, who stated the new Bagno del Papa as a battlemented building, resembling a fortress, about 30 x 20 m in size with high towers at the corners of its southern façade. Located outside Viterbo, the spa would have been an easy target for assaults had the building not assumed a militant character, which also affirmed papal authority. Aside from the regal apartments described by Manedtti there were vaulted chambers at the lowest level to accommodate the patrons of the several thermal springs.

Manetti and Vasari both named the Florentine architect and sculptor Bernardo Rossellino as the architect of the project in Viterbo. There is, however, no documentation or architectural evidence to connect Rossellino directly with the construction of the Bagno del Papa. To the contrary, Vatican payment records from 1454, preserved in the state archives in Rome, identify a stonemason from Lombardy, named Stefano di Beltrame, as the builder who &quot;had done or was doing in the house ordered by the pope at the bagni della Grotta and Crociata of Viterbo.&quot;

Construction at the Bagno del Papa was continued on through the reigns of several popes after Nicholas V. The Vatican accounts mention of payments &quot;for building done at the bath palace of Viterbo&quot; during the reigns of Calixtus III, Paul II, and Sixtus IV. There also is evidence Pope Pius II was responsible for the addition of a western wing to the building.

Travelers&#x27; descriptions, etched views, and local guidebooks chronicle the fate of the Renaissance Bagno del Papa over the years and through several rebuildings resulting in a general assumption that most of the original 15th-century structure had vanished. A guide to Viterbo from 1911 does note that some remnants were still to be detected in basement piers and vaults. In operation as a thermal hospital in 1927, the building was blown up by retreating German forces in 1944.

Despite all the travails, much of the original Bagno del Papa built by Popes Nicholas V and Pius II survives, including the corner towers and the vaulted chambers where Renaissance patrons once bathed.

==Military==
Viterbo became a centre of military aviation due to its proximity to Rome, especially after the opening of the Air Force base (now the Rome Viterbo Airport but still used for military purposes) during the 1930s. The Army Aviation Command headquarters and training school (Italian: Scuola marescialli dell&#x27;Aeronautica Militare) are both located there.

The Army&#x27;s NCO training establishment (Italian: Scuola sottufficiali dell&#x27;Esercito Italiano) is also located in the city.

== Religion ==
=== Patron saints === 
St. Rose is the patron saint of Viterbo. The legend of Santa Rosa is that she helped to eradicate those few who supported the emperors instead of the popes, around 1250. Saint Lawrence is the male patron saint.

=== &quot;Macchina di Santa Rosa&quot; ===
The transport of the Macchina di Santa Rosa takes place every year, on 3 September, at 9 o&#x27;clock in the evening. The Macchina is an artistic illuminated bell-tower with an imposing height of 30 m. It weighs between 3.5 and 5 tonnes and is made of iron, wood and papier-mâché. At the top of the tower, the statue of the patron saint is enthusiastically acclaimed by the people in the streets of the town centre, where lights are turned off for the occasion. One hundred Viterbesi men (known as the &quot;Facchini&quot;) carry the Macchina from Porta Romana through each of the major streets of Viterbo to seven churches to be blessed, concluding with a strenuous ascension up to the Piazza di Santa Rosa, its final resting place. Each Macchina&#x27;s lifespan differs, but contests for a new design are held every few years.

== Transportation ==

The Rome Viterbo Airport was opened in 1936 as part of Viterbo Air Force Base, located from the town. On 26 November 2007, Italian transport minister Alessandro Bianchi announced that Viterbo had been chosen as the site of the next airport in Lazio to serve Rome. However, in 2013 those plans were abandoned.
Viterbo is served by regional trains departing from Station Ostiense, Trastevere, S. Pietro and sometimes at Termini in Rome. Porta Romana is the station serving the old city center.

==Education==
The city is home to the Tuscia University, established in 1979. It is also the city where students of School Year Abroad&#x27;s Italy program study, their school housed in a 16th-century palazzo on Via Cavour.

<doc id="92902" wikidata="Q1500342" url="?curid=92902" title="Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu">
<text>, originally called , is a Japanese martial art that first became widely known in the early 20th century under the headmastership of Takeda Sōkaku. Takeda had extensive training in several martial arts (including Kashima Shinden Jikishinkage-ryū and Sumo) and referred to the style he taught as &quot;Daitō-ryū&quot; (literally, &quot;Great Eastern School&quot;). Although the school&#x27;s traditions claim to extend back centuries in Japanese history there are no known extant records regarding the &quot;ryū&quot; before Takeda. Whether Takeda is regarded as either the restorer or the founder of the art, the known history of Daitō-ryū begins with him. Takeda&#x27;s best-known student was Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.

==History==
Daitō-ryū (also known as simply Aiki-jūjutsu) is mostly considered to be a fighting style created by the Seiwa Minamoto clan, and handed down from generation to generation. It was Shinra Saburo Minamoto Yoshimitsu the one who compiled all its teachings around the 11th century. Shinra Saburō Minamoto no Yoshimitsu (新羅 三郎 源 義光, 1045–1127) was a Minamoto clan samurai and member of the Seiwa Genji (the branch of the Minamoto family descended from the 56th imperial ruler of Japan, Emperor Seiwa). Yoshimitsu studied and researched the techniques handed down in his family in more detail. It is also believed that Yoshimitsu dissected the corpses of men killed in battle, studying their anatomy for the purpose of learning techniques for joint-locking and atemi-waza (nerve striking). Daitō-ryū takes its name from the mansion that Yoshimitsu lived in as a child, called , in Ōmi Province (modern day Shiga Prefecture). 
Yoshimitsu eventually settled down in Kai Province (modern day Yamanashi Prefecture), and passed on what he learned within his family. Ultimately, Yoshimitsu&#x27;s great-grandson Nobuyoshi adopted the surname &quot;Takeda&quot;, which has been the name of the family to the present day. The Takeda family remained in Kai Province until the time of Takeda Shingen (武田 信玄, 1521–1573). Shingen opposed Tokugawa Ieyasu and Oda Nobunaga in their campaign to unify and control all of Japan. With the death of Shingen and his heir, Takeda Katsuyori (武田 勝頼, 1546–1582), the Takeda family relocated to the Aizu domain (an area comprising the western third of modern-day Fukushima Prefecture).

Though these events caused the Takeda family to lose some of its power and influence, it remained intertwined with the ruling class of Japan. More importantly, the move to Aizu and subsequent events profoundly shaped what would emerge as Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu in the 19th century. One important event was the adoption of Tokugawa Ieyasu&#x27;s grandson, Komatsumaru (1611–1673), by Takeda Kenshoin (fourth daughter of Takeda Shingen). Komatsumaru devoted himself to the study of the Takeda family&#x27;s martial arts, and was subsequently adopted by Hoshina Masamitsu. Komatsumaru changed his name to Hoshina Masayuki (保科 正之), and in 1644 was appointed the governor of Aizu. As governor, he mandated that all subsequent rulers of Aizu study the arts of Ono-ha Ittō-ryū (which he himself had mastered), as well as the art of &quot;oshikiuchi&quot;, a martial art which he developed for shogunal counselors and retainers, tailored to conditions within the palace. These arts became incorporated into and combined with the Takeda family martial arts.

According to the traditions of Daitō-ryū, it was these arts which Takeda Sokaku began teaching to non-members of the family in the late 19th century. Takeda had also studied swordsmanship and spearmanship with his father, Takeda Sokichi, as well as Kashima Shinden Jikishinkage-ryū as an &quot;uchi-deshi&quot; (live-in student) under the renowned swordsman Sakakibara Kenkichi. During his life, Sokaku traveled extensively to attain his goal of preserving his family&#x27;s traditions by spreading Daitō-ryū throughout Japan.

Takeda Sokaku&#x27;s third son, Tokimune Takeda (武田 時宗 &quot;Takeda Tokimune&quot;, 1916–1993), became the headmaster of the art following Sokaku&#x27;s death in 1943. Tokimune taught what he called , an art that included the sword techniques of the Ono-ha Ittō-ryū along with the traditional techniques of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu. It was also under Tokimune&#x27;s headmastership that modern &quot;dan&quot; rankings were first created and awarded to the students of Daitō-ryū. Tokimune Takeda died in 1993 leaving no official successor, but a few of his high-ranking students, such as Katsuyuki Kondo (近藤 勝之 &quot;Kondō Katsuyuki&quot;, 1945–) and Shigemitsu Kato, now head their own Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu organizations.

==Aiki-jūjutsu==
&quot;Aiki-jūjutsu&quot; can be broken into three styles: jujutsu (hard); aiki no jutsu (soft); and the combined aikijujutsu (hard/soft). Modern aikido originated in aikijujutsu, which emphasizes &quot;an early neutralization of an attack&quot;. Like other forms of jujutsu, it emphasizes throwing techniques and joint manipulations to effectively subdue or injure an attacker. Of particular importance is the timing of a defensive technique either to blend or to neutralize an attack&#x27;s effectiveness and to use the force of the attacker&#x27;s movement against him. Daitō-ryū is characterized by ample use of &quot;atemi&quot;, or the striking of vital areas, to set up jointlocking or throwing tactics.

Some of the art&#x27;s striking methods employ the swinging of the outstretched arms to create power and to hit with the fists at deceptive angles, as may be observed in techniques such as the atemi that sets up &quot;gyaku ude-dori&quot; (reverse elbow lock). Tokimune Takeda regarded one of the unique characteristics of the art to be its preference for controlling a downed attacker&#x27;s joints with one&#x27;s knee to leave one&#x27;s hands free to access weapons or to deal with the threat of other attackers.

== Branches ==
Currently, there are a number of organizations that teach Daitō-ryū, each tracing their lineage back to Takeda Sokaku through one of six of his students. Those six students are: Takeda Tokimune, the progenitor of the Tokimune branch; Takuma Hisa (久 琢磨 &quot;Hisa Takuma&quot;, 1895–1980), of the Hisa branch; Kōdō Horikawa (堀川 幸道 &quot;Horikawa Kōdō&quot;, 1894–1980), of the Horikawa branch; Toshimi ‘Hosaku’ Matsuda (1895 - ?) kyoju-dairi 教授代理 of the Daito Ryu Aikijujutsu Shobukai ;Yukiyoshi Sagawa (&quot;Sagawa Yukiyoshi&quot;, 1902–1998), of the Sagawa branch, and Somekichi Kobayashi (1901–1999), of the Kobayashi branch.

=== Tokimune ===
The Tokimune branch descends from the teachings of Tokimune Takeda, the son of Takeda Sokaku, and designated successor of Daitō-ryū upon the father&#x27;s death. When Tokimune died, he had not appointed a successor; there are two main groups that carry on his teachings.

The first group is led by Katsuyuki Kondō, who began his training under Tsunejiro Hosono and continued training under Kōtarō Yoshida (吉田 幸太郎 &quot;Yoshida Kōtarō&quot;, 1883–1966) for a time, before being introduced to Tokimune. On the basis of the high level teaching licenses Kondo was granted by Tokimune, his followers represent his school as the Daitō-ryū &quot;mainline&quot;. Kondo has done much to increase the visibility of the art by hosting seminars both in Tokyo and abroad, especially in Europe and the United States. In the last years many Branches were created all over the world. The biggest groups are located in Italy (under Alex Muracchini and Luca Canovi), Russia (under Evgeny Bodrenko and Stanislav Kopin), Netherlands (Robert Breedveld, Niels van Willigen, Anton Brandregt, and Ilse van der Hoeven), Slovakia (under Stephan Kurilla). In the USA there are also several Branch dōjōs such as Derek Steel in Philadelphia, Mark Sumi in Los Angeles and Jose Garrido in the New York City Metro area. In the United Kingdom there is a study group in Suffolk (under Oran Redmond). Australia study group is led by Rachael Crompton in Sidney. Switzerland’s study groups are led by Pascal Badan (Lausanne) and Selahattin Ak (Zürich).

The second group from the Tokimune branch is headed by Shigemitsu Kato and Gunpachi Arisawa, who are long-time students and teachers from Tokimune&#x27;s original Daitokan headquarters in Hokkaidō. This organization is called the . They maintain a smaller organization in Hokkaidō, with strong connections to practitioners in Europe (especially Italy), the United States, and Brazil.

=== Hisa ===
The second major branch of Daitō-ryū is represented by students of Takuma Hisa. His students banded together and founded the . They have a wealth of materials in the form of film and still photographs, taken at the Asahi Newspaper &quot;dōjō&quot;, recording the Daitō-ryū techniques taught to them, first by Morihei Ueshiba and then later by Takeda Sokaku directly. One of their major training manuals, called the &quot;Sōden&quot;, features techniques taught to them by both masters.

The Takumakai represents the second largest &quot;aiki-jūjutsu&quot; organization. The current director is Mori Hakaru assisted by honorary director is Chiba Tsugutaka, and the manager is Kobayashi Kiyohiro. Chiba Tsugutaka, who proposed the idea of naming the organization &quot;Takumakai&quot;, also spent some time training at the Daito-kan in Hokkaido under Takeda Tokimune.

In the 1980s, led by Shogen Okabayashi (&quot;Okabayashi Shogen&quot;, born 1949-2018), who was sent by the elderly Hisa to train under the headmaster, the Takumakai made a move to implement the forms for teaching the fundamentals of the art as originally established by Tokimune Takeda. This move upset some preservers of Hisa&#x27;s original teaching method, leading to the formation of a new organization called the Daibukan, founded by a long term student of Hisa, Kenkichi Ohgami (&quot;Ōgami Kenkichi&quot;, born 1936). Later, in order to implement greater changes to the curriculum, Okabayashi himself chose to separate from the Takumakai and formed the Hakuho-ryu.

=== Horikawa ===
The Horikawa branch descends from the teachings of Kōdō Horikawa. A few organizations have been formed based on his teachings.

The was founded by students of Horikawa, whose distinctive interpretation of &quot;aiki&quot; movements can be seen in the movements of his students. The Kodokai is located in Hokkaidō and is headed by Yusuke Inoue (&quot;Inoue Yasuke&quot;, born 1932). Both Inoue&#x27;s father and his main teacher, Horikawa, were direct students of Takeda Sokaku. Inoue received his teaching license (&quot;Menkyo Kaiden&quot;) in accordance with Horikawa&#x27;s final wishes.

There are two major teachers who branched off from the Kodokai to establish their own traditions. The first was Seigō Okamoto (岡本 正剛 &quot;Okamoto Seigō&quot;, 1925-2015) who founded the . His interpretation of &quot;aiki&quot; and minimal movement throws. The organization has a great following abroad, especially in the United States and Europe. Another group was that of Katsumi Yonezawa (米沢 克巳 &quot;Yonezawa Katsumi&quot;, 1937–1998), who founded his own organization, called the . In the early 1970s, while Yonezawa was still a senior teacher at the Kodokai, he was the first person to bring Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu to the United States and Canada. The Bokuyōkan is currently run by his son Hiromitsu Yonezawa (&quot;Yonezawa Hiromitsu&quot;), headquartered in Hokkaidō, with a following at the Yonezawa &quot;dojo&quot; and several branches in the United States, as well as a &quot;dojo&quot; in Germany.

=== Sagawa ===
The last major group consists of students of Yukiyoshi Sagawa (佐川 幸義, &quot;Sagawa Yukiyoshi&quot;, 1902–1998), who was once considered to be the successor to Takeda Sokaku (should Tokimune not have survived World War II). Sagawa ran only a single &quot;dojo&quot; and taught a relatively small number of students. He began studying Daitō-ryū under Takeda Sokaku in 1914 after first learning the art from his father, Sagawa Nenokichi (1867–1950), who was also a student of Sokaku and a holder of a &quot;Kyōju Dairi&quot; (teaching license) in the system. Although considered by many to be one of the most accomplished students of Sokaku, Yukiyoshi Sagawa received the &quot;kyoju dairi&quot; in 1932—but did not receive the &quot;menkyo kaiden&quot; (certificate of mastery) of the system&#x27;s secrets, as during the time he practised under Takeda Sokaku, the highest licence was not the &quot;menkyo kaiden&quot;. Sagawa often served as a teaching assistant to Takeda and traveled with him to various locations in Japan teaching Daito-ryu. He further developed the art of applying Aiki and is said to have remained powerful until very late in life, and – as a consequence of the success of &quot;Transparent Power&quot; – was featured in a series of articles in the Aiki News magazines prior to his death in 1998.

Tatsuo Kimura (木村 達雄 &quot;Kimura Tatsuo&quot;, born 1947), a former mathematics professor at the University of Tsukuba and a senior student of Sagawa, ran a small &quot;aiki-jūjutsu&quot; study group at that institution. He retired from his professorship there in June 2013, and has retired from public instruction of Daito Ryu. He now privately instructs a small group of students. He has written two books about his training under Sagawa: &quot;Transparent Power&quot; and &quot;Discovering Aiki&quot;.

== Aiki concept ==
Takeda Sokaku defined &quot;aiki&quot; in the following way:
Tokimune Takeda, speaking on the same subject during an interview explained in more detail about the concept of &quot;aiki&quot;:

== Classification of techniques ==
Daitō-ryū techniques involve both jujutsu and &quot;aiki-jūjutsu&quot; applications. Techniques are broken up into specific lists which are trained sequentially; that is, a student will not progress to the next &quot;catalogue&quot; of techniques until he/she has mastered the previous one. Upon completion of each catalogue, a student is awarded a certificate or scroll that lists all of the techniques of that level. These act as levels of advancement within the school, and was a common system among classical Japanese martial arts schools before the era of belts, grades, and degrees.

The first category of techniques in the system, the &quot;shoden waza&quot;, is not devoid of &quot;aiki&quot; elements, though it emphasizes the more direct jujutsu joint manipulation techniques. The second group of techniques, the &quot;aiki-no-jutsu&quot;, tends to emphasize the utilization of one&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s movement or intention in order to subdue him/her—usually with a throwing or a pinning technique. A list of the catalogues in the Tokimune branch&#x27;s system and the number of techniques contained within follows:

Officially, the Daitō-ryū system is said to comprise thousands of techniques, divided into &quot;omote&quot; and &quot;ura&quot; (literally, &#x27;front&#x27; and &#x27;back&#x27; versions), but many of these could be seen as variations upon the core techniques. In addition, Sokaku and Tokimune awarded scrolls denoting certain portions of the curriculum, such as techniques utilizing the long and short sword.

To the list above, the Takumakai adds the &quot;Daito-ryu Aiki Nito-ryu Hiden&quot;. The Takumakai also makes substantial use of the photographic documents of techniques taught at the Asahi Newspaper &quot;dojo&quot; by Morihei Ueshiba and Takeda Sokaku, which are compiled into a series of 11 training manuals called the &quot;Sōden&quot;.

==Influence==
The significant interest in this martial art, which has much in common with the many less popular classical Japanese jujutsu schools, is probably due largely to the success of Takeda Sokaku&#x27;s student Morihei Ueshiba, and the art that he founded, aikido. Aikido is practised internationally and has hundreds of thousands of adherents. Many of those interested in aikido have traced the art&#x27;s origins back to Daitō-ryū, which has increased the level of interest in an art which was otherwise virtually unknown a few decades before.

Aikido&#x27;s influence was significant even in its early years, prior to World War II, when Ueshiba was teaching a more overtly combative form closer to Daitō-ryū. One of the main conduits of the influence of Ueshiba&#x27;s pre-war aiki-jūjutsu was Kenji Tomiki, founder of Shodokan Aikido. Tomiki was already ranked 5th &quot;dan&quot; in judo when he began studying under Ueshiba. Today&#x27;s &quot;goshin jutsu kata&quot;, or &quot;forms of self defense&quot; (created in 1956 by a team of experts after Kanō Jigorō&#x27;s death, and thus not belonging to original judo), preserve these teachings, as does Tomiki&#x27;s own organization of Shodokan Aikido.

=== Related arts ===
The concept of &quot;aiki&quot; is an old one, and was common to other classical Japanese schools of armed combat. There are some other styles of Japanese jujutsu that use the term &quot;aiki-jūjutsu&quot;, but there are no records of its use prior to the Meiji era. Many modern schools influenced by aikido presently utilize the term to describe their use of aikido-like techniques with a more combative mindset.

There are a number of martial arts in addition to aikido which appear, or claim, to be descended from the art of Daitō-ryū or the teachings of Takeda Sōkaku. Among them are: the Korean martial art of hapkido founded by Choi Yong-sool, who claims to have been trained under Takeda Sokaku; Choi gave two versions of his story, one in 1962 and another completely different one in 1982. Hakkō-ryū founded by Okuyama Yoshiharu, who trained under Takeda Sokaku; and Shorinji Kempo, founded by Nakano Michiomi (later known as So Doshin), who is known to have trained under Okuyama. Additionally, Icho-ryū – an offshoot designed for police defense is practiced widely in Washington state. Many techniques from Hakko-ryu are similar to the techniques of Daitō-ryu. Certain styles of Karate also use joint manipulation and locking techniques.

<doc id="92903" wikidata="Q152018" url="?curid=92903" title="Ghetto">
<text>A ghetto is a part of a city in which members of a minority group are concentrated, especially as a result of political, social, legal, religious, environmental or economic pressure. Ghettos are often known for being more impoverished than other areas of the city. Versions of such restricted areas have been found across the world, each with their own names, classifications, and groupings of people.

The term was originally used for the Venetian Ghetto in Venice, Italy, as early as 1516, to describe the part of the city where Jewish people were restricted to live and thus segregated from other people. However, other early societies may have formed their own versions of the same structure; words resembling &quot;ghetto&quot; in meaning appear in Hebrew, Yiddish, Italian, Germanic, Polish, Corsican, Old French, and Latin. During the Holocaust, more than 1,000 Nazi ghettos were established to hold the Jewish populations of Europe, with the goal of exploiting and killing European Jews as part of the Final Solution of Nazi Germany.

The term &quot;ghetto&quot; acquired deep cultural meaning in the United States, especially in the context of segregation and civil rights. It has been widely used in the country since the 20th century to refer to poor neighborhoods of largely minority populations. It is also used in some European countries, such as Romania and Slovakia, to refer to poor neighborhoods largely inhabited by Romani people. The term slum is usually used to refer to areas in developing countries that suffer from absolute poverty, while the term 
ghetto is used to refer to areas of developed countries that suffer from relative poverty.

== Etymology and name ==
The word &quot;ghetto&quot; originates from the Venetian &quot;ghetto&quot;, the Jewish quarter in Venice&#x27;s Cannaregio district where Jews were legally confined following a 1516 decree. In the 16th century, Italian Jews, including those in Venice, commonly used the unrelated Hebrew term &quot;ḥāṣēr&quot; (&#x27;courtyard&#x27;) to refer to a ghetto. By 1855, the term &quot;ghetto&quot; had been extended to refer to &quot;any area occupied predominantly by a particular social or ethnic group, especially a densely populated urban area which is subject to social and economic pressures, tending to restrict its demographic profile.&quot;

The etymology of the Italian &quot;ghetto&quot; has long been debated among linguists, with no single theory achieving universal acceptance. Although often cited, the idea that it derives from the Hebrew &quot;gēṭ&quot; (&#x27;letter of divorce&#x27;; because the ghetto separated Jews from the rest of the population) is considered a folk etymology. Similarly, the Italian variant &quot;ghet&quot;, found in some Jewish notarial documents from the late 16th and early 17th centuries, seems to be a folk-etymological modification of &quot;ghetto&quot;, influenced by the Hebrew &quot;gēṭ&quot;.

Another commonly held hypothesis, mentioned by the Oxford English Dictionary, proposes that the term comes from an unattested Italian &quot;*gheto&quot; (&#x27;foundry&#x27;; cf. Italian &quot;getto&quot; &#x27;the process of founding or casting metal&#x27;; 14th cent.), from post-classical Latin &quot;iectus&quot; or &quot;iactus&quot; (attested in a 1295 Venetian source referring to the locality), which could be compared to post-classical Latin &quot;ghetus&quot; or &quot;gettus&quot; (attested from 1306 in Venetian sources referring to the locality). However, linguist Anatoly Liberman argues that this explanation fails to account for the problematic phonetic change from Latin &quot;i-&quot; to Italian &quot;g-&quot; ~ &quot;gh-&quot;, and that there is no certainty that &quot;getto&quot; ever meant &#x27;foundry&#x27; in the Venetian dialect. Alternatively, Liberman has suggested that in some Romance-speaking regions a slang borrowing from the Germanic &quot;gata&quot; (&#x27;street&#x27; or &#x27;narrow street&#x27;) may have existed in various forms, which eventually evolved into the Italian &quot;ghetto&quot;. Originally, the term may have carried a derogatory sense, referring to the impoverished quarters of exiled Venetian Jews. Over time, folk etymology further shaped its meaning, associating it with ideas like cannon foundries and separation.

Other suggestions, such as that the word is a shortening of &quot;Egitto&quot; (&#x27;Egypt&#x27;) or &quot;borghetto&quot; (&#x27;small settlement&#x27;), or that it is related to the Old French &quot;guect&quot; (&#x27;guard&#x27;), are rejected by linguists as speculative and unconvincing. Additional proposals derive the term from &quot;ghectus&quot; (understood as the Latinized form of Yiddish &quot;gehektes&quot; &#x27;enclosed&#x27;) or from the Latin neuter &quot;Giudaicetum&quot; (&#x27;Jewish&#x27;), but they too lack sufficient phonetic support.
== Ghettos in Europe == 

=== Jewish ghettos ===

The character of ghettos has varied through times. The term was used for an area known as the Jewish quarter, which meant the area of a city traditionally inhabited by Jews in the diaspora. Jewish quarters, like the Jewish ghettos in Europe, were often the outgrowths of segregated ghettos instituted by the surrounding authorities. A Yiddish term for a Jewish quarter or neighborhood is &quot;Di yidishe gas&quot; (), or &#x27;The Jewish street&#x27;. Many European and Middle Eastern cities once had a historical Jewish quarter.

Jewish ghettos in Christian Europe existed because of majority discrimination against Jews on the basis of religion, language and dated views on race: They were considered outsiders. As a result, Jews were placed under strict regulations throughout many European cities.

In some cases, the ghetto was a Jewish quarter with a relatively affluent population (for instance the Jewish ghetto in Venice). In other cases, ghettos were places of terrible poverty. During periods of population growth, ghettos (as that of Rome) had narrow streets and tall, crowded houses. Residents generally were allowed to administer their own justice system based on Jewish traditions and elders.

==== Nazi-occupied Europe ====
During World War II, the Nazis established new ghettos in numerous cities of Eastern Europe as a form of concentration camp to confine Jews and Romani into limited areas. The Nazis most often referred to these areas in documents and signage at their entrances as &quot;Jewish quarter.&quot; These Nazi camps sometimes coincided with traditional Jewish ghettos and Jewish quarters, but not always. On June 21, 1943, Heinrich Himmler issued a decree ordering the dissolution of all &quot;Jüdische Wohnbezirke&quot;/ghettos in the East and their transference to Nazi concentration camps or their extermination.

The Nazi ghettos were an essentially different institution than the historical ghettos of European society. The historical ghettos were places where Jews lived for many generations and created their own culture even if they were under social and political conditions of segregation and discrimination. The Nazi ghettos were part of The Final Solution; they were intended as a transitional stagefirst confine each city&#x27;s Jews in one easily accessible and controllable location, then &quot;liquidate&quot; the ghetto and send the Jews to an extermination camp. Most Nazi ghettos were liquidated in 1943; some, such as that of Łódź, persisted until 1944; very few, e.g. the Budapest Ghetto and the Theresienstadt Ghetto, existed until the end of the war in 1945.

=== Roma ghettos ===
There are many Roma ghettos in the European Union. The Czech government estimates that there are approximately 830 Roma ghettos in the Czech Republic.

=== In Denmark ===
During the period 2010–2021, the word &quot;ghetto&quot; was used officially by the Danish government to describe certain officially designated vulnerable social housing areas in the country. The designation was applied to areas based on the residents&#x27; income levels, employment status, education levels, criminal convictions and proportion of non-Western immigrants and their descendants. The term was controversial during its period of use and was finally removed in 2021.

In 2010, the Danish Ministry of Transport, Building and Housing introduced an official listing of vulnerable social housing districts where the inhabitants fulfilled certain criteria. The list has informally and at times formally been called &quot;Ghettolisten&quot; (the &#x27;List of Ghettos&#x27;). Since 2010, the list has been updated annually, with changes in the definition and/or terminology in 2013, 2018 and 2021.

In 2018, the Danish government at the time, led by Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, announced its intention to &quot;end the existence of parallel societies and ghettos by 2030.&quot; A number of measures was introduced to solve the issue of integration, including policies like 25 hours of obligatory daycare or corresponding parent supervision per week for children in the appointed areas starting age 1, lowering social welfare for residents, incentives for reducing unemployment, demolition and rebuilding of certain tenements, rights for landlords to refuse housing to convicts, etc. The policies have been criticized for undercutting &#x27;equality before law&#x27; and for portraying immigrants, especially Muslim immigrants, in a bad light.

The term &quot;ghetto&quot; was controversial during the period of its usage, inhabitants feeling stigmatized by the wording and researchers pointing out that the areas in question were typically inhabited by 20-40 different ethnic minorities, hence being diametrically opposed to the ethnic homogeneity of the original ghettos, so that multi-ethnic residential areas would be a more appropriate term.

In June 2019 a new social democratic government was formed in Denmark, with Kaare Dybvad becoming housing minister. He stated that the new government would stop using the word &quot;ghetto&quot; for vulnerable housing areas, as it was both imprecise and derogatory. In a 2021 reform, the name was finally removed in legal texts by Parliament. Instead, a new category called &quot;parallel societies&quot; was instituted.

=== In France ===
In France, a &quot;banlieue&quot; () is a suburb of a large city. Banlieues are divided into autonomous administrative entities and do not constitute part of the city proper. For instance, 80% of the inhabitants of the Paris area live outside the city of Paris. Like the city centre, suburbs may be rich, middle-class or poor — Versailles, Le Vésinet, Maisons-Laffitte and Neuilly-sur-Seine are affluent banlieues of Paris, while Clichy-sous-Bois, Bondy and Corbeil-Essonnes are less so. However, since the 1970s, &quot;banlieues&quot; increasingly means, in French of France, low-income housing projects (HLMs) in which mainly foreign immigrants and French of foreign descent reside, often in perceived poverty traps.

=== In the United Kingdom ===
The existence of ethnic enclaves in the United Kingdom is controversial. Southall Broadway, a predominantly Asian area in Greater London, where less than 12 percent of the population is white, has been cited as an example of a &#x27;ghetto&#x27;, but in reality the area is home to a number of different ethnic groups and religious groups.

Analysis of data from Census 2001 revealed that only two wards in England and Wales, both in Birmingham, had one dominant non-white ethnic group comprising more than two-thirds of the local population, but there were 20 wards where whites were a minority making up less than a third of the local population. By 2001, two London boroughs—Newham and Brent—had &quot;minority majority&quot; populations, and most parts of the city tend to have a diverse population.

Historically, some parts of London have long been noted for the prevalence of a particular ethnic or religious group (such as the Jewish communities of Golders Green and other parts of the London Borough of Barnet, and the West Indian community of Notting Hill), but in each case these populations have been part of a broader multicultural population. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the East End of London was also noted for its Jewish population, but now has a significant British Bangladeshi populace.

==== In Northern Ireland ====
In Northern Ireland, towns and cities have long been segregated along ethnic, religious and political lines. The two main communities of Northern Ireland are:

# the Irish nationalist-republican community, who mainly self-identify as Irish or Catholic; and
# the unionist-loyalist community, who mainly self-identify as British or Protestant.

Ghettos emerged in Belfast during the riots that accompanied the Irish War of Independence. For safety, people fled to areas where their community was the majority. Many more ghettos emerged after the 1969 riots and beginning of the &quot;Troubles.&quot; In August 1969 the British Army was deployed to restore order and separate the two sides. The government built barriers called &quot;peace lines.&quot; Many of the ghettos came under the control of paramilitaries such as the (republican) Provisional Irish Republican Army and the (loyalist) Ulster Defence Association. One of the most notable ghettos was Free Derry.

== Ghettos in the United States ==
=== Early ghettos ===
The development of ghettos in the United States is closely associated with different waves of immigration and internal urban migration. The Irish and German immigrants of the mid-19th century were the first ethnic groups to form ethnic enclaves in United States cities. This was followed by large numbers of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, including many Italians and Poles and Russians between 1880 and 1920. Jewish immigrants were part of the earliest German wave, as well as comprising numerous immigrants from Eastern Europe, the Russian Empire at the time. Most remained in their established immigrant communities, but by the second or third generation, many families were able to relocate to newer housing built in the suburbs after World War II.

These ethnic ghetto areas included the Lower East Side in Manhattan, New York, which later became notable as predominantly Jewish, and later still as Chinese and Latino. East Harlem was once predominantly Italian and in the 1950s became home to a large Puerto Rican community. Little Italys across the country were predominantly Italian ghettos. Many Polish immigrants settled in areas of other nationals, such as Pilsen of Chicago and Polish Hill of Pittsburgh. Since the late 20th century, Brighton Beach in Brooklyn has become the home of predominately Jewish Russian and Ukrainian immigrants, who left after the Soviet Union lifted some migration restrictions and later after its fall.
=== Black or African-American ghettos ===

A commonly used definition of a ghetto is a community distinguished by a homogeneous race or ethnicity. Additionally, a key feature that developed throughout the post-industrial era and continues to symbolize the demographics of American ghettos is the prevalence of poverty. Poverty constitutes the separation of ghettos from other, suburbanized or private neighborhoods. The high percentage of poverty partly justifies the difficulty of emigration, which tends to reproduce constraining social opportunities and inequalities in society.
The term ghettos has been commonly used for some time, but ghettos were around long before the term was coined. Urban areas in the U.S. can often be classified as &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot;, with the inhabitants primarily belonging to a homogenous racial grouping. This classification can be traced back as early as the year 1880 as African Americans were living in their own neighborhoods. Sixty years after the American civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, most of the United States remains a residentially segregated society in which black people and white people inhabit different neighborhoods of significantly different quality.

Many of these neighborhoods are located in Northern and Western cities where African Americans moved during the Great Migration (1914–1970), a period when over a million African-Americans moved out of the rural southern United States to escape the widespread racism of the South; to seek out employment opportunities in industrial cities; and to pursue what was widely perceived to be a better quality of life in the North and West, such as New York City, Detroit, Cleveland, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Oakland, Portland, and Seattle. African Americans found they had to struggle with white ethnic groups in Northern and Midwestern cities; many of them more recent European immigrants. Often they were restricted to areas of older and poor housing in the new cities where they settled.

The social disruption and economic competition following World War I, as veterans returned to the US, resulted in an outbreak of racial violence of whites against blacks in many of these Northern cities, such as Chicago, Omaha; Washington, DC, and others. Southern industrial cities were also affected. Such racist attacks were extremely violent, in some cases they included burning or bombing homes of African Americans; many innocent blacks were killed. African-American leaders described 1919 as the Red Summer because of the widespread racial outbreaks and white attacks on mainly African Americans.

Two main factors ensured further separation between races and classes, and ultimately the development of contemporary ghettos: the relocation of industrial enterprises, and the movement of middle to upper class residents into suburban neighborhoods. Between 1967 and 1987, economic restructuring resulted in a dramatic decline of manufacturing jobs, which had formerly provided good livings for unionized, working-class blacks and whites. The once thriving northern and western industrial cities survived by a gradual shift to service and financial occupations. Subsidized highways and suburban development in the postwar period had pulled many middle and upper-class families and related businesses to the suburbs. Those who could not afford to move were left with disrupted neighborhoods and economies in the inner cities. African Americans were disproportionately affected and became either unemployed or underemployed, with little wage and reduced benefits. A concentration of African Americans predominated in some inner city neighborhoods.

It is also significant to compare the demographic patterns between black people and European immigrants, according to the labor market. European immigrants and African Americans were both subject to an ethnic division of labor. Because of discrimination, African Americans were often restricted to the least secure division of the labor market. David Ward refers to this stagnant position in African-American or Black ghettos as the &#x27;elevator&#x27; model, which implies that each group of immigrants or migrants takes turns in the processes of social mobility and suburbanization; and several groups did not start on the ground floor. The inability of black people to move from the ground floor, as Ward suggests, is dependent upon prejudice and segregationist patterns established in the South prior to World War I, where most African Americans were disenfranchised by the turn of the century and deprived of political power.

After the of African Americans to the North during and after World War I, they had to compete with numerous European immigrants; thus, African-Americans were diminished to unskilled jobs. The slow rate of advancement in black communities outlines the rigidity of the labor market, competition and conflict, adding another dimension to the prevalence of poverty and social instability in African-American or Black ghettos.

==== Effect of World War II on development ====
In the years following World War II, many white Americans began to move away from inner cities to newer suburban communities, a process known as white flight. White flight occurred, in part, as a response to black people moving into white urban neighborhoods. Discriminatory practices, especially those intended to &quot;preserve&quot; emerging white suburbs, restricted the ability of black people to move from inner cities to the suburbs, even when they were economically able to afford it. In contrast to this, the same period in history marked a massive suburban expansion available primarily to whites of both wealthy and working-class backgrounds, facilitated through highway construction and the availability of federally subsidized home mortgages (VA, FHA, Home Owners&#x27; Loan Corporation). These made it easier for families to buy new houses in the suburbs, but not to rent apartments in cities.

The United States began restructuring its economy after World War II, fueled by new globalizing processes, and demonstrated through technological advances and improvements in efficiency. The structural shift of 1973, during the post-Fordist era, became a large component to the racial ghetto and its relationship with the labor market. Sharon Zukin declares the designated stratum of African-Americans in the labor force was placed even below the working class; low-skill urban jobs were now given to incoming immigrants from Mexico or the Caribbean. Additionally, Zukin notes, &quot;Not only have social services been drastically reduced, punitive and other social controls over the poor have been increased,&quot; such as law enforcement and imprisonment. Described as the &quot;urban crisis&quot; during the 1970s and 1980s, the transition stressed regional divisions according to differences in income and racial lines—white &quot;donuts&quot; around black holes. Hardly coincidental, the steady separation occurred during the period of civil rights laws, urban riots and Black Power. In addition, the &quot;International Encyclopedia of Social Sciences&quot; stresses the various challenges developed by this &quot;urban crisis&quot;, including:

The cumulative economic and social forces in ghettos give way to social, political and economic isolation and inequality, while indirectly defining a separation between superior and inferior status of groups.

In response to the influx of black people from the South, banks, insurance companies, and businesses began denying or increasing the cost of services, such as banking, insurance, access to jobs, access to health care, or even supermarkets to residents in certain, often racially determined, areas. The most devastating form of redlining, and the most common use of the term, refers to mortgage discrimination. Data on house prices and attitudes toward integration suggest that in the mid-twentieth century, segregation was a product of collective actions taken by non-black people to exclude black people from outside neighborhoods.

The &quot;Racial&quot; Provisions of the FHA Underwriting Manual of 1936 included the following guidelines which exacerbated the segregation issue:
This meant that ethnic minorities could secure mortgage loans only in certain areas, and it resulted in a large increase in the residential racial segregation and urban decay in the United States. The creation of new highways in some cases divided and isolated black neighborhoods from goods and services, many times within industrial corridors. For example, Birmingham, Alabama&#x27;s interstate highway system attempted to maintain the racial boundaries that had been established by the city&#x27;s 1926 racial zoning law. The construction of interstate highways through black neighborhoods in the city led to significant population loss in those neighborhoods and is associated with an increase in neighborhood racial segregation. Residential segregation was further perpetuated because whites were willing to pay more than black people to live in predominantly white areas. Some social scientists suggest that the historical processes of suburbanization and decentralization are instances of white privilege that have contributed to contemporary patterns of environmental racism.

Following the emergence of anti-discrimination policies in housing and labor sparked by the civil rights movement, members of the black middle class moved out of the ghetto. The Fair Housing Act was passed in 1968. This was the first federal law that outlawed discrimination in the sale and rental of housing on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion and later sex, familial status, and disability. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity was charged with administering and enforcing the law. Since housing discrimination became illegal, new housing opportunities were made available to the black community and many left the ghetto. Urban sociologists frequently title this historical event as &quot;black middle class exodus&quot;, or black flight. Elijah Anderson describes a process by which members of the black middle class begin to distance themselves socially and culturally from ghetto residents during the later half of the twentieth century, &quot;eventually expressing this distance by literally moving away.&quot; This is followed by the exodus of black working-class families. As a result, the ghetto becomes primarily occupied by what sociologists and journalists of the 1980s and 1990s frequently title the &quot;underclass.&quot; William Julius Wilson suggests this exodus worsened the isolation of the black underclass — not only were they socially and physically distanced from whites, they also became isolated from the black middle class.

==== Theories on the development of Black ghettos ====
Two dominant theories arise pertaining to the production and development of U.S. ghettos: race-based and class-based; as well as an alternative theory put forward by Thomas Sowell.

===== Race-based theories =====
First are the race-based theorists, who argue the importance of race in ghettos. Their analysis consists of the dominant racial group in the U.S. (White Anglo-Saxon Protestants) and their use of certain racist tactics in order to maintain their hegemony over black people and lengthen their spatial separation. Race-based theorists offset other arguments that focus on the influence of the economy on segregation. More contemporary research of race-based theorists is to frame a range of methods conducted by white Americans to &quot;preserve race-based residential inequities&quot; as a function of the dominantly white, state-run government. Involving uneven development, mortgage and business discrimination and disinvestment—U.S. ghettos then, as suggested by race-based theorists, are conserved by distinctly racial reasoning.

===== Class-based theories =====
The more dominant view, on the other hand, is represented by class-based theorists. Such theories confirm class to be more important than race in the structuring of U.S. ghettos. Although racial concentration is a key signifier for ghettos, class-based theorists emphasize the role and impact of broader societal structures in the creation of African-American or Black ghettos. Dynamics of low-wage service and unemployment triggered from deindustrialization, and the intergenerational diffusion of status within families and neighborhoods, for instance, prove the rise in socioeconomic polarization between classes to be the creator of American ghetto; not racism. Furthermore, the culture of poverty theory, first developed by Oscar Lewis, states that a prolonged history of poverty can itself become a cultural obstacle to socioeconomic success, and in turn can continue a pattern of socioeconomic polarization. Ghettos, in short, instill a cultural adaptation to social and class-based inequalities, reducing the ability of future generations to mobilize or migrate.

===== Alternative theory =====
An alternative theory put forward by Thomas Sowell in &quot;Black Rednecks and White Liberals&quot; asserts that modern urban black ghetto culture is rooted in the white Cracker culture of the North Britons and Scots-Irish who migrated from the generally lawless border regions of Britain to the American South, where they formed a redneck culture common to both black and white people in the antebellum South. Characteristics of this culture included lively music and dance, violence, unbridled emotions, flamboyant imagery, illegitimacy, religious oratory marked by strident rhetoric, and a lack of emphasis on education and intellectual interests. Because redneck culture proved counterproductive, &quot;that culture long ago died out...among both white and black Southerners, while still surviving today in the poorest and worst of the urban black ghettos&quot;, which Sowell described as being characterized by &quot;brawling, braggadocio, self-indulgence, [and] disregard of the future&quot;, and where &quot;belligerence is considered being manly and crudity is considered cool, while being civilized is regarded as &#x27;acting white&#x27;.&quot; Sowell blames liberal Americans who since the 1960s have embraced black ghetto culture as the only &quot;&#x27;authentic&#x27; black culture and even glamorize it&quot; while they &quot;denounce any criticism of the ghetto lifestyle or any attempt to change it.&quot; Sowell asserts that white liberal Americans have perpetuated this &quot;counterproductive and self-destructive lifestyle&quot; among black Americans living in urban ghettos through &quot;the welfare state, and look-the-other-way policing, and smiling at &#x27;gangsta rap&#x27;.&quot;

==== U.S. characterizations of &quot;ghetto&quot; ====
Contemporary African-American or Black ghettos are characterized by an overrepresentation of a particular ethnicity or race, vulnerability to crime, social problems, governmental reliance and political disempowerment. Sharon Zukin explains that through these reasons, society rationalizes the term &quot;bad neighborhoods.&quot; Zukin stresses that these circumstances are largely related to &quot;racial concentration, residential abandonment, and de-constitution and reconstitution of communal institutions.&quot; Many scholars diagnose this poorly facilitated and fragmented view of the United States as the &quot;age of extremes.&quot; This term argues that inequalities of wealth and power reinforce spatial separation; for example, the growth of gated communities can be interconnected with the continued &quot;ghettoization&quot; of the poor.

Another characteristic to African-American or Black ghettos and spatial separation is the dependence on the state, and lack of communal autonomy; Sharon Zukin refers to Brownsville, Brooklyn, as an example. This relationship between racial ghettos and the state is demonstrated through various push and pull features, implemented through government subsidized investments, which certainly assisted the movement of white Americans into the suburbs after World War II. Since the 1960s, after the de-constitution of the inner cities, African-American or Black ghettos have attempted to reorganize or reconstitute; in effect, they are increasingly regarded as public- and state-dependent communities. Brownsville, for instance, initiated the constitution of community-established public housing, anti-poverty organizations, and social service facilities—all, in their own way, depend on state resources. However, certain dependence contradicts society&#x27;s desires to be autonomous actors in the market. Moreover, Zukin implies, &quot;the less &#x27;autonomous&#x27; the community—in its dependence on public schools, public housing and various subsidy programs—the greater the inequity between their organizations and the state, and the less willing residents are to organize.&quot; This should not, however, undermine local development corporations or social service agencies helping these neighborhoods. The lack of autonomy and growing dependence on the state, especially in a neoliberal economy, remains a key indicator to the production as well as the prevalence of African-American or Black ghettos, particularly due to the lack of opportunities to compete in the global market.

The concept of the &quot;ghetto&quot; and &quot;underclass&quot; has faced criticism both theoretically and empirically. Research has shown significant differences in resources for neighborhoods with similar populations both across cities and over time. This includes differences in the resources of neighborhoods with predominantly low income or racial minority populations. The cause of these differences in resources across similar neighborhoods has more to do with dynamics outside of the neighborhood. To a large extent the problem with the &quot;ghetto&quot; and &quot;underclass&quot; concepts stem from the reliance on case studies (in particular case studies from Chicago), which limit social scientist understandings of socially disadvantaged neighborhoods.

===== Internal characterizations =====
Despite mainstream America&#x27;s use of the term &quot;ghetto&quot; to signify a poor, culturally or racially homogenous urban area, those living in the area often used it to signify something positive. The black ghettos did not always contain dilapidated houses and deteriorating projects, nor were all of its residents poverty-stricken. For many African-Americans, the ghetto was &quot;home&quot;: a place representing authentic blackness and a feeling, passion, or emotion derived from rising above the struggle and suffering of being black in America.

Langston Hughes relays in his &quot;Negro Ghetto&quot; (1931) and &quot;The Heart of Harlem&quot; (1945) poems:

Playwright August Wilson uses the term &quot;ghetto&quot; in &quot;Ma Rainey&#x27;s Black Bottom&quot; (1984) and &quot;Fences&quot; (1985), both of which draw upon the author&#x27;s experience growing up in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, a black ghetto.

==== Modern usage and reinterpretations of &quot;ghetto&quot; ====
Recently the word &quot;ghetto&quot; has been used in slang as an adjective rather than a noun. It is used to indicate an object&#x27;s relation to the inner city and also more broadly to denote something that is shabby or of low quality. While &quot;ghetto&quot; as an adjective can be used derogatorily, the African-American or Black community, particularly the hip hop scene, has taken the word for themselves and begun using it in a more positive sense that transcends its derogatory origins.

In 1973, &quot;Geographical Review&quot; claimed &quot;The degree of residential segregation of the black community is greater than for any other group in urban America, yet black people have not had the political power necessary to exercise any significant degree of control over the improvement of the basic services necessary for their health, education, and welfare.&quot; Scholars have been interested in the study of African-American or Black ghettos precisely for the concentration of disadvantaged residents and their vulnerability to social problems. American ghettos also bring attention to geographical and political barriers, and as Doreen Massey highlights, that racial segregation in African-American or Black ghettos challenge America&#x27;s democratic foundations. However, it is still advocated that &quot;One solution to these problems depends on our ability to use the political process in eliminating the inequities... geographical knowledge and theory to public-policy decisions about poor people and poor regions is a professional obligation.&quot;

== Ghettos elsewhere ==

=== Shanghai ghetto ===
Before and during World War II, many Jews fled from German-occupied Europe to Shanghai. After Japan invaded China, it established the Shanghai Ghetto, an area of approximately one square mile (≈2.6km2) in the Hongkou District of the Empire of Japan, to which it relocated about 20,000 Jewish refugees under its &quot;Proclamation Concerning Restriction of Residence and Business of Stateless Refugees&quot;.

<doc id="92906" wikidata="Q350198" url="?curid=92906" title="Olaus Rudbeck">
<text>Olaus Rudbeck (also known as Olof Rudbeck the Elder, to distinguish him from his son, and occasionally with the surname Latinized as &quot;Olaus Rudbeckius&quot;) (13 September 1630 – 12 December 1702) was a Swedish scientist and writer, professor of medicine at Uppsala University, and for several periods &quot;rector magnificus&quot; of the same university. He was born in Västerås, the son of Bishop Johannes Rudbeckius, who was personal chaplain to King Gustavus Adolphus, and the father of botanist Olof Rudbeck the Younger. Rudbeck is primarily known for his contributions in two fields: human anatomy and linguistics, but he was also accomplished in many other fields including music and botany. He established the first botanical garden in Sweden at Uppsala, called Rudbeck&#x27;s Garden, but which was renamed a hundred years later for his son&#x27;s student, the botanist Carl Linnaeus.

==Human anatomy==
Born into the Rudbeck family, Olaus was one of the pioneers in the study of lymphatic vessels. According to his supporters in Sweden, he was the first to discover the lymphatic system and is documented as having shown his findings at the court of Queen Christina of Sweden in the Spring of 1652. However, he did not publish anything about it until the fall of 1653, after Thomas Bartholin, a Danish scientist, had published a description of a similar discovery of his own. (For other early discoverers of the lymphatic system, see Gasparo Aselli and Jean Pecquet).

Rudbeck was appointed professor of medicine at Uppsala University in 1660. Rudbeck&#x27;s research led to the Queen&#x27;s support of his career. To facilitate his studies of human anatomy, he had a cupola built on top of Gustavianum, a university edifice, and in it was built an arena-like &quot;Theatrum anatomicum&quot;, where dissection could be carried out in front of students. The cupola still remains and is a landmark in Uppsala. The &quot;Gustavianum&quot; stands in front of the cathedral, and is still part of the university.

==Historical linguistics==
Between 1679 and 1702, Rudbeck dedicated himself to contributions in historical-linguistics patriotism, writing a 3,000-page treatise in four volumes called &quot;&quot; where he purported to prove that Sweden was Atlantis, the cradle of civilization, and Swedish the original language of Adam from which Latin and Hebrew had evolved. His work was criticized by several Scandinavian authors, including the Danish professor Ludvig Holberg, and the Swedish author and physician Andreas Kempe, both of whom wrote satires based on Rudbeck&#x27;s writings. His work was later used by Denis Diderot in the article &quot;Etymologie&quot; in &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; as a cautionary example of deceptive linking of etymology with mythical history.

David King, in his biography of Rudbeck, notes that he developed a system for measuring the age of old monuments and graves by the thickness of the humus accumulated over them – which, though many of his conclusions were erroneous, anticipated the methods of modern archaeology and was far in advance of most historians and antiquarians of his time.

Despite the criticism targeting his linguistic theories and despite the priority dispute with Bartholin, Rudbeck remained a national icon in Sweden for many years. His son, Olof Rudbeck the Younger, continued his linguistic work and also became involved in providing an &quot;intellectual reason&quot; for power during a period when Sweden aspired to a position as one of the great powers of Europe. Rudbeck the Younger added speculations about the relationship between Sami and Hebrew languages to his father&#x27;s long list of fantastical linguistic relationships. A nephew of Olaus the Elder, Petter Rudebeck, also wrote antiquarian books going even further, purporting to locate the scene of the Trojan War and ancient city of Troy in southern Sweden.

The above-mentioned David King noted that, while specific conclusions of father and son Rudbeck about the relationships of various languages to each other were disproven, they anticipated the later systematic study of Indo-European languages, and the scientific proof that languages distant from each other geographically and historically are indeed related.

==Legacy==
Rudbeck was active in many scientific areas, including botany and astronomy, and left many traces still visible in the city of Uppsala today.

In 1655, he established the first botanical garden in Sweden at Uppsala, called Rudbeck&#x27;s Garden, but which was renamed a hundred years later for his son&#x27;s student, the botanist Carl Linnaeus. Rudbeck also aimed to produce a projected 12-volume encyclopedia of all known plants of the world called &quot;Campi elysii.&quot; Life-sized woodcut illustrations of many of the species were included in the two volumes that were published, and the woodblocks for these were made by Rudbeck as well as his son Olof, his two daughters, ohanna Christina and Wendela, and other colleagues. It is thought that about 3,200 woodblocks were cut for the series, and those remaining today (about 140 from volume 1) are housed at the Linnean Society of London. 

The plant genus &quot;Rudbeckia&quot; was named by Linnaeus in honor of both Rudbeck and his son.

During the course of a fire that destroyed most of Uppsala in 1702, a large portion of Rudbeck&#x27;s writings, woodblocks and copies of the first two volumes of &quot;Campi elysii&quot; was lost. Rudbeck himself directed the people of the city, shouting orders from a roof while his house burned down. He died the same year, shortly after the fire, and was buried in Uppsala Cathedral at the transept.

The Nobel family, including Ludvig Nobel, the founder of Branobel, and Alfred Nobel, the founder of the Nobel Prizes, was a descendant of Rudbeck through his daughter Wendela, who married one of her father&#x27;s former students, Peter Olai Nobelius.

<doc id="92908" wikidata="Q625363" url="?curid=92908" title="Community of Christ">
<text>Community of Christ, known from 1872 to 2001 as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS), is an American-based international church, and is the second-largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement. The church reports approximately 250,000 members in 1,100 congregations in 59 countries. The church traces its origins to Joseph Smith&#x27;s establishment of the Church of Christ on April 6, 1830. His eldest son, Joseph Smith III, formally accepted leadership of the church on April 6, 1860 in the aftermath of the 1844 death of Joseph Smith.

Community of Christ is a Restorationist faith expression. Still, various practices and beliefs are congruent with mainline Protestant Christianity. While it generally rejects the term &quot;Mormon&quot; to describe its members, the church abides by a number of theological distinctions unusual outside Mormonism, including but not limited to: ongoing prophetic leadership, a priesthood polity, the use of the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants as scripture, belief in the cause of Zion, the building of temples, and an interpretation of the Word of Wisdom. In many respects, the church differs from the larger Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and most other Latter Day Saint denominations in its religious liberalism, belief in a more traditional conception of the trinity (as opposed to a godhead of three separate and distinct beings), and rejection of exaltation and the plan of salvation. Salvation is considered a personal matter and not subject to dogma, but salvation by grace alone is emphasized. The church considers itself to be non-creedal and accepts people with a wide range of beliefs. Church teachings emphasize that &quot;all are called&quot; as &quot;persons of worth&quot; to &quot;share the peace of Christ&quot;.

Community of Christ worship follows a free-form worship placing more of the foundation on scripture based on the Revised Common Lectionary. From its headquarters in Independence, Missouri, the church offers a special focus on evangelism, peace and justice ministries, spirituality and wholeness, youth ministries and outreach ministries.

==History==
Formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the Community of Christ regards itself as the true embodiment of the original church organized in 1830 by Joseph Smith, and it regards Joseph Smith III, the eldest surviving son of Smith, to have been his legitimate successor. The church was &quot;legally organized on April 6, 1830, in Fayette, New York&quot;. The formal reorganization occurred on April 6, 1860, in Amboy, Illinois, as the &quot;Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&quot;, adding the word &quot;Reorganized&quot; to the church name in 1872. The church was founded based on a pattern of lineal succession through Joseph Smith of Prophet/presidents of the church, and as a mainstream alternative to the Strangites and the larger LDS church led by Brigham Young. It has a long history as a Midwestern wing of the Latter Day Saint movement. It also had a long history of vocal opposition to plural marriage within the Latter Day Saint movement.

Community of Christ considers the period from 1830 to 1844 to be a part of its early history and from 1844, the year of the death of the prophet-founder, to 1860, to be a period of disorganization. Since 1844, the doctrines and practices of the Community of Christ have evolved separately from the other denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement.

=== Changes in beliefs and practices ===
During the twentieth century, the then-Reorganized Church underwent what some scholars termed an &quot;RLDS Reformation&quot; in which the denomination&#x27;s leadership pivoted toward mainline Protestant religious thought. Since the 1960s, the church&#x27;s proselytizing outside North America have caused a re-assessment and gradual evolution of its traditional practices and beliefs.

A revelation presented by Wallace B. Smith in 1984 decreed the construction of the Independence Temple and the ordination of women to the priesthood, after long-standing calls for both. Following the retirement of Smith as Prophet-President of the Church, W. Grant McMurray was appointed as the new President. Although McMurray had been designated prophet-president by Smith, some members objected because he was the first church president who was not a direct descendant of Joseph Smith, which they considered to be a distinguishing trait from other denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement.

These changes, among others, were controversial among the membership, and they led to the formation of breakaway churches such as the Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints; in 1994, former church historian Richard P. Howard estimated that 25,000 members had left to join such groups. Between the mid-1960s and the late 1990s, there was a one-third decline in new baptisms in the United States along with a 50 percent drop in contributions in the decade before 1998. The decline in membership was offset somewhat by an increase in converts outside the United States. Growth continues to be driven by missions outside the US, particularly in the developing world and in Australia. In recent years, the church has attracted many ex-Mormons.

The vision and mission statements of the Community of Christ were adopted in 1996 by the leading quorums of the church&#x27;s leadership and reflect the peace and justice centered ministries of the denomination. In its mission statement, the church declares that &quot;[w]e proclaim Jesus Christ and promote communities of joy, hope, love and peace.&quot; The vision statement states that &quot;We will become a worldwide church dedicated to the pursuit of peace, reconciliation, and healing of the spirit.&quot;

== Sites ==
The church owns and operates the Independence Temple, which serves as its headquarters in Independence, Missouri. The church also owns and operates some Latter Day Saint historic sites in Lamoni, Iowa, and Plano, Illinois. The Auditorium in Independence housed the Children&#x27;s Peace Pavilion until it was renamed the Peace Pavilion and moved into its own facility just east of the Temple complex. The Auditorium is the site of the major legislative assembly of the Community of Christ, which convenes during the triennial World Conference. The church sponsors Graceland University, with a campus in Lamoni and another in Independence, where the School of Nursing and the Community of Christ Seminary are based.

For over a century, the denomination owned and operated the Kirtland Temple. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) purchased the Kirtland Temple and took on ownership as of March 5, 2024. Several previously Community-of-Christ-owned historic sites in Nauvoo, Illinois—including the Red Brick Store, Smith Family Homestead, and Mansion House—also transferred ownership as part of the same acquisition.

==Teachings and practices==

The Community of Christ states that it recognizes that &quot;perception of truth is always qualified by human nature and experience&quot; and it therefore has not adopted an official religious creed. Nevertheless, the Community of Christ offers a number of the commonly held beliefs of its members and leaders as the &quot;generally accepted beliefs of the church&quot;. As Stephen M. Veazey, president of the church stated in 2006, &quot;Community of Christ is a church that provides light for the way as well as space for the personal faith journey.&quot;

After the death of Smith rended the initial movement, Community of Christ emerged as what historian Jan Shipps called a simultaneous &quot;new creation&quot; and &quot;extension... of the original&quot;. In the twentieth century, Community of Christ underwent a &quot;liberal protestantization&quot; and is &quot;[l]ike other mainline and liberal Protestantisms&quot;, Vanel explains.

The Community of Christ generally accepts the doctrine of the Trinity and other commonly held Christian beliefs. The concept of Zion as both a present reality of Christian living and as a hoped for community of the future is a rather strongly held belief in the Community of Christ and it ties closely to the peace and justice emphasis of the denomination. The movement also differs from most other Christian faiths in its belief in prophetic leadership, in the Book of Mormon, and in an open canon of scripture recorded in its version of the Doctrine and Covenants, which is regularly appended.

===God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit===
The Community of Christ teaches that the &quot;one eternal living God is triune&quot;. It acknowledges God, who is a &quot;community of three persons&quot;, as the Creator and the Source of love, life, and truth. It states that &quot;[t]his God alone is worthy of worship.&quot; Jesus Christ is described as both Savior and as &quot;a living expression of God&quot; and is acknowledged as having lived, died, and been resurrected. As the name of the denomination implies, Jesus Christ is central to its members&#x27; study and worship. The Community of Christ&#x27;s Theology Task Force states that &quot;Jesus Christ is the Word made flesh, both fully human and fully divine.&quot; The Holy Spirit is described as the &quot;continuing presence of God in the world&quot; and as the source of divine inspiration.

===Peace===
In keeping with the Community of Christ&#x27;s role as a &quot;peace and justice church&quot;, the Independence Temple was &quot;dedicated to the pursuit of peace&quot;. Every day at 1 pm a Daily Prayer for Peace is held in the sanctuary of the Independence Temple. The church&#x27;s peace position was influenced by the Mennonite Central Committee Peace and Justice Education Associate. In addition, the Community of Christ International Peace Award has been bestowed annually since 1993 (except 1996). The call to &quot;peace, reconciliation, and healing of the spirit&quot; is a recurring theme of the Community of Christ and is reflected in its official vision statement. Doctrinal statements by the church suggest that &quot;because of our commitment to Christ and belief in the worth of all people and the value of community building, we dedicate our lives to the pursuit of peace and justice for all people.&quot; 

===Concept of Zion===
The concept of Zion in the Community of Christ relates to a theology of the &quot;kingdom of God&quot;. As a doctrine, it is therefore closely founded upon the kingdom parables of Jesus as recorded in the four gospels. Based on references in the Bible to Mt. Zion or simply Zion, it was initially regarded as a city, sometimes called the New Jerusalem. Prior to 1920, most members of the RLDS Church identified Independence, Missouri, as Zion or the New Jerusalem. As New Testament understandings of basileia, as the realm or the domain of God, have gradually taken root among members of the denomination, Zion is now understood more as a cause, as a way of living or as a state of existence, and is usually not regarded as having its foundation in a specific place. Officially, the denomination states that &quot;[t]he &#x27;cause of Zion&#x27; expresses our commitment to pursuing God&#x27;s kingdom through the establishment of Christ-centered communities in families, congregations, neighborhoods, cities, and throughout the world.&quot; While the Concept of Zion is rarely associated with the Jewish concept of Zionism, some members of the RLDS Church from Maine, intrigued by the doctrine of Zion, established a refugee center near Tel Aviv during the initial return of the Jewish diaspora to Israel in the early 1900s.

===Priesthood===
Nearly one in ten members of the church hold a priesthood office. These are primarily unpaid bi-vocational ministers. The church does maintain a relatively small group of professional ministers who typically serve as administrators, financial officers or missionaries. Priesthood members are called to teach and preach the gospel or &quot;good news&quot; of Jesus Christ. The ministry of the church at the congregational level is led by priesthood members and is carried out by all members of the priesthood and the laity. In most congregations the pastors and other elected and appointed leadership positions are unpaid positions. The right of women to hold the priesthood was recognized by a church conference in 1984.

===Stewardship===
The &quot;Disciples&#x27; Generous Response&quot; (or &quot;A Disciple&#x27;s Generous Response&quot;) was announced in April 2002 as the name given by the Community of Christ to a major rethinking of its stewardship theology and practices. Prior to this program, members of the Community of Christ were taught that a stewardship principle known as &quot;increase&quot; determined the base amount for tithing to be paid to the church.

Based in part on teachings by writers such as Walter Brueggemann and Leonard Sweet, the Disciple&#x27;s Generous Response can be traced to a theology or liturgy of abundance, as well as the principle of receiving God&#x27;s abundance. Like many recent enhancements of church doctrine and practice, it is described as belonging to a postmodernism trend in thinking within the church. While carefully built upon the many differing stewardship principles in both overall Christian and specific Community of Christ traditions, the new thinking emphasizes a natural generosity in all of life lived as response to the overwhelming and incomparable generosity of God. As such, tithing is not limited to World Church giving as in the past, or even to the church at all. Through the principle of community tithes, almost any charitable organization to which a disciple contributes could be considered tithing. While most giving is now seen as tithing, the typical interpretation is that a majority of one&#x27;s tithing should be given in Mission Tithes (Tithes to Local and World Church) and the minority to Community Tithes (Organizations like Outreach International, Graceland University, Restoration Trails Foundation, World Accord, etc.). The church teaches the principle of community tithes believing that it will not decrease giving to the church, but rather increase it as more members embrace a fully generous and responsive way of living.

===Sacraments===

Members commonly believe that sacraments (or ordinances) express the abiding presence of God in the life of the church, its members and priesthood. Sacraments are considered metaphorical acts designed to create and renew a person&#x27;s spiritual relationship with God. Sacraments are viewed as covenants with God in response to God&#x27;s grace. The Community of Christ practices eight sacraments: baptism, confirmation, blessing of children, The Lord&#x27;s Supper, marriage, ministration to the sick, ordination, and Evangelist&#x27;s Blessing. Laying on of hands is used in confirmation, ordination, the blessing of children, ministration to the sick, and Evangelist&#x27;s blessing.

===Scripture===
The Community of Christ points to Jesus Christ as the living Word of God and it affirms the Bible (including but not limited to the Inspired Version of the Holy Scriptures) along with the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants, as scripture for the church. The Community of Christ view of scripture is that it should be &quot;reasonably interpreted and faithfully applied&quot;. Scripture references provided for congregational worship generally follow the Revised Common Lectionary. The church views the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants as &quot;additional witnesses of Christ&#x27;s ministry and God&#x27;s love.&quot; The Community of Christ understands scripture as an inspired record of God&#x27;s activity with humanity. While it recognizes scripture as the revelation of God, its members would not typically suggest that scriptures constitute the literal &quot;words of God&quot;. 

====Bible====
In unity with Christianity, the Community of Christ upholds the Bible as scripture. Adherents read and reference both the Hebrew Old Testament and the Christian New Testament in public worship as well as in private study. The church encourages prayerful meditation upon the meaning and the importance of Bible passages. &quot;If any of you is lacking in wisdom, ask God, who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly, and it will be given you. But ask in faith, never doubting&quot; (James 1:5–6) is an oft quoted passage from the New Testament, as well as being the scripture reference that Joseph Smith read when he was trying, as a boy, to determine what church to join. His experience following his reading of this scripture resulted in the eventual organization of the Church of Christ.

The Community of Christ does not prescribe a single translation of the Bible. Although Smith began a project to revise the King James Version by inspiration during his lifetime, the liturgy of the church today is usually based on more recent translations of the Bible. Upon Smith&#x27;s death, the working manuscript of his translation was retained by his family and came into the possession of the Community of Christ. The work was edited and is published by the church as the Inspired Version of the Bible. Since it largely relies on the language of the King James Version, most official publications of the Community of Christ quote scripture from newer versions such as the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV). The Community of Christ does not view scripture, including the Bible, as inerrant. Members are encouraged to understand the historical and literary context of Bible passages and are not required to interpret all of the language literally.

====Book of Mormon====

The Community of Christ views the Book of Mormon as an additional witness of Jesus Christ and publishes two versions of the book through its official publishing arm, Herald House. The Authorized Edition is based on the original printer&#x27;s manuscript and the 1837 Second Edition (or Kirtland Edition) of the Book of Mormon. Its content is similar to the Book of Mormon published by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), but the versification is different. The Community of Christ also publishes a 1966 &quot;Revised Authorized Edition&quot; which attempts to modernize some of the language.

In 2001, church president W. Grant McMurray reflected on increasing questions about the Book of Mormon: &quot;The proper use of the Book of Mormon as sacred scripture has been under wide discussion in the 1970s and beyond, in part because of long-standing questions about its historicity and in part because of perceived theological inadequacies, including matters of race and ethnicity.&quot; 

At the 2007 Community of Christ World Conference, church president Stephen M. Veazey ruled as out of order a resolution to &quot;reaffirm the Book of Mormon as a divinely inspired record&quot;. In so doing he stated that &quot;while the Church affirms the Book of Mormon as scripture, and makes it available for study and use in various languages, we do not attempt to mandate the degree of belief or use. This position is in keeping with our longstanding tradition that belief in the Book of Mormon is not to be used as a test of fellowship or membership in the church.&quot;

The Community of Christ&#x27;s official stance has stated about the Book of Mormon (under Affirmation Nine):
&quot;With other Christians, we affirm the Bible as the foundational scripture for the church. In addition, the Community of Christ uses the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants as scripture. We do not use these sacred writings to replace the witness of the Bible or improve upon it, but because they confirm its message that Jesus Christ is the Living Word of God (Preface of the Book of Mormon; Doctrine and Covenants 76: 3g).&quot;

====Book of Doctrine and Covenants====
The Community of Christ edition of the Doctrine and Covenants is a growing work of scripture containing inspired documents given through the prophet-presidents recognized by the Community of Christ.

===Ecumenism and interfaith activities===
The Community of Christ has made efforts to reconcile with traditional Christianity and to reach out to other Christians. The Community of Christ frequently notes that it has never sanctioned polygamy; it has always ordained persons of any race; it has no required creedal statement, asking only that people profess faith in Christ as a condition for baptism; it has accepted Trinitarian doctrine; it has been in dialogue with the National Council of Churches (NCC), the World Council of Churches (WCC), and Christian Churches Together; and it has practiced open communion since 1994. On November 10, 2010, the Community of Christ was unanimously approved for membership by the National Council of Churches, becoming the 37th member communion of this ecumenical body.

In its World Conference in 2002, a committee on &quot;Ecumenical/Interfaith Relations&quot; was established to explore the possibility of entering into the membership of the WCC. In its report for the 2004 World Conference, the committee concluded that while there was an openness to further meetings and discussions, there were concerns about several issues including new entrance criteria based on theology and the Community of Christ&#x27;s acceptance of extra-biblical scriptures. The report states that this warrants caution in their approach, but the dialogue would continue.

===Women&#x27;s participation===
The church&#x27;s priesthood was opened to women in 1984. In 1998, Gail E. Mengel and Linda L. Booth became the first two women apostles in the church. At the 2007 World Conference of the church, Becky L. Savage was ordained as the first woman to serve in the First Presidency. In 2013, Linda L. Booth became the first woman elected to serve as president of the Council of Twelve. In 2016, Stassi D. Cramm became the first woman presiding bishop of the church and Jane M. Gardner became the church&#x27;s first female presiding evangelist.

===LGBTQ participation===
The church is accepting of same-sex relationships.

For a period of time, the church under the presidency of W. Grant McMurray allowed the priesthood ordination of practicing homosexuals, something which he acknowledged was already occurring. The church would later halt this practice, prohibiting the ordination of sexually active homosexuals. However, the church allows those who were ordained against policy to continue in priesthood office.

In 2012, the Community of Christ held national conferences in Canada and Australia both of which recommended to church leadership to change standing policies regarding ordination to include those in same-sex marriage (Canada) and in marriage-like same-sex committed relationships (Australia), and in Canada to extend the sacrament of marriage to same-sex couples. Official policy changes for these nations have since been released that follow the recommendations of these conferences.

The Community of Christ&#x27;s 2013 USA National Conference like those in Canada and Australia recommended changes. Those changes were recommended for the extension of the sacrament of marriage to same-sex couples in states where same-sex marriages are legal, the extension of covenant commitment services for same-sex couples in states where same-sex marriages are not legal, and extending eligibility for the priesthood call sacrament to all church members regardless of sexual orientation or open same-sex relationship. As a result of these recommendations, church leadership released in March 2014 policy embracing the recommendations for the church in the United States.

Ireland and Great Britain held a special multi-nation conference in 2013 which also recommended changes to policy similar to those of Canada, Australia, and the United States. The changes have yet to be approved by the First Presidency and Council of Twelve for Ireland and Great Britain, with the likely time-frame to &quot;develop, approve, and implement interim policies&quot; being up to one year after the 2013 Conferences.

A petition by the Australia Mission Centre Council to permit same-sex marriages was approved by the First Presidency in 2017.

==Organization and structure==

The Community of Christ is led by a First Presidency, consisting of a president and two counselors. The president is regarded as a prophet. The church&#x27;s ministry is overseen by a Council of Twelve Apostles and the financial concerns of the church are overseen by the Presiding Bishopric. Meeting together, these three quorums are known as the World Church Leadership Council.

Other key leadership positions include Presiding Evangelist, Senior President of the Presidents of Seventy, President of the High Priests Quorum, and Ecumenical and Interfaith Officer. Every three years (formerly two, until a change made in 2007), delegates from around the world meet together with these leaders to vote on church business in World Conference.

The Community of Christ has 250,000 members in 1,100 congregations in 59 countries according to the most recent report. Membership is distributed as 30,000 in Africa, 9,000 in Asia, 8,000 in Canada, 13,250 in the Caribbean, 2,500 in Europe, 12,250 in the Pacific and Australia, 4,500 in Central and South America, and 117,000 in the United States according to the 2016 World Conference Bulletin.

The church is officially established in these countries and territories: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, the Cayman Islands, Chile, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Fiji, France, French Polynesia, Germany, Guam, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, India, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Korea, Liberia, Malawi, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Republic of the Congo, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the United States, Venezuela, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

It is estimated that more than half of the active members of the church speak a primary language other than English. The church translates resources into French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Telugu, Kwi, Sora, Tahitian, Chewa, Chibemba, Efik, Lingala and Swahili.

For the purposes of church organization and administration, the church has divided the world into geographical areas termed fields (which can include areas that are not adjoining, such as Australia and parts of Canada). Each field is presided over by a member of the Council of Twelve Apostles, who are collectively overseen by a member of the First Presidency, in his or her capacity of Director of Field Ministries (this role was previously held by the President of the Council of Twelve but followed the outgoing president when he joined the First Presidency in 2013). Fields are further divided into multiple Mission Centers, which succeeded the former jurisdictional units known as stakes and regions (which were each further divided into the now abolished level of district). Each mission center is presided over by a president. Mission centers are composed of congregations, presided over by a pastor or co-pastors.

The organizational fields are: Africa and Haiti Mission Field, Asia Mission Field, Canada and Australia Mission Field, Caribbean–Mexico Mission Field, Central and South America Mission Field, Eurasia Mission Field, North Central USA/Canada Mission Field, North East USA Mission Field, Pacific Mission Field, South Central USA Mission Field, Southern USA Mission Field and Western USA Mission Field.

==Criticisms==
Latter-Day Saint scholars, including members of the Community of Christ, have sometimes described the church as &quot;adrift&quot;, not being distinctively Mormon enough, but not completely mainline either. The church has made a long-standing effort to de-mythologize its past, for example, by taking a pragmatic view of the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith, both of which the church now views as inspired but imperfect. Historian Ken Mulliken has argued that this has led to a policy of &quot;historical amnesia&quot;, resulting in a church that has abandoned its past and created a new organization that is focused on social-interaction (Community) and shared mission (Christ).

<text>The Holy See exercised sovereign and secular power, as distinguished from its spiritual and pastoral activity, while the pope ruled the Papal States in central Italy. 

The Papal States ceased to exist following the capture of Rome in 1870 by the Royal Italian Army, after which its remaining territories were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy. The Lateran Treaty of 1929 later established the Vatican City, a small city-state where the Holy See currently exercises temporal powers.

== Origins ==


===Patrimony of Saint Peter===
The Lateran Palace was the first significant acquisition of the Holy See, most probably a gift from Constantine the Great. The example of Constantine was followed by wealthy families of the Roman nobility, and the residences and estates that were acquired in turn were designated the &quot;Patrimonium Sancti Petri.&quot; After the deposition of the last Roman emperor in the West in 476, the popes were subjects, first of Odoacer, then Arian Ostrogothic kings, then of the Byzantine emperors, who ruled their Italian territories via a governor called an &quot;exarch,&quot; stationed in Ravenna&quot;.&quot;

Pope Gregory II&#x27;s defiance of the Byzantine Emperor Leo III the Isaurian as a result of the first iconoclastic controversy (726 AD) in the Byzantine Empire, widened the growing divergence between the Byzantine and Carolingian traditions in what was still a unified European Church. This, combined with Lombard military pressure to which the embattled empire could not respond effectively, eventually led to the establishment of the temporal power of the popes. The Duchy of Rome was an imperial territory under the Exarchate of Ravenna. With the waning of Byzantine control in the Italian peninsula, more of the management of the area fell to the popes.

===Donation of Pepin===
In 751 the Exarchate of Ravenna fell to Lombard King Aistulf. Five years later, Pepin the Short of the Franks defeated the Lombards and granted the lands of the Duchy of Rome as well as territory ceded by the Lombards to the Papacy in what is referred to as the Donation of Pepin, marking the true beginning of the Papal States. The area conferred upon the pope included the territory belonging to Ravenna, even cities such as Forlì with their hinterlands, the Lombard conquests in the Romagna and in the Duchy of Spoleto and Benevento, and the Pentapolis (the &quot;five cities&quot; of Rimini, Pesaro, Fano, Senigallia and Ancona). Narni and Ceccano were former papal territories. However, the medieval Popes were unable to exercise effective sovereignty over these extensive and mountainous territories, given the recalcitrance of their vassals.

For over a thousand years popes ruled as sovereign over an amalgam of territories on the Italian peninsula known as the Papal States, from the capital, Rome. In 1274 the Comtat Venaissin came under Papal control, followed by Avignon in 1348.

== Early modern period ==

Theologian Robert Bellarmine, in his 16th-century dogmatic work , strongly affirmed the authority of the pope as the vicar of Christ. However, he reasoned that since Christ did not &quot;exercise&quot; his temporal power, neither may the pope.

In 1590, Pope Sixtus V had, of his own initiative, placed the first volume of the on a new edition of the for denying that the pope had direct temporal authority over the whole world. The entry concerning Bellarmin reads: Sixtus V died before he could promulgate the bull which would have made this new edition of the &quot;Index&quot; enter into force. Sixtus&#x27; successor, Urban VII, asked for an examination and after it was done Bellarmine was exonerated and the book removed from the &quot;Index&quot;.

Concerning the pastoral and spiritual power of the pope, Bellarmine&#x27;s (1586–1593) and (1610; &quot;Concerning the Power of the Supreme Pontiff in Temporal Matters&quot;) &quot;gave definite form to the theory of papal supremacy&quot;.

== 19th century ==
The secular revolutionary movements of the 1800s posed a serious threat to the pope&#x27;s temporal power. Avignon was seized by revolutionaries during the French Revolution in 1791, ending 450 years of papal sovereignty there. Between 1798 and 1814, the revolutionary French government invaded Italy several times and annexed the Papal States (though the papacy was restored between 1800 and 1809). Napoleon Bonaparte abolished the pope&#x27;s temporal power in 1809, incorporating Rome and Latium into his First French Empire. Pope Pius VII himself was even taken prisoner by Napoleon. However, the pope&#x27;s temporal power was restored by the Great powers at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in the 1815 Congress of Vienna. The civil laws of the Napoleonic Code were abolished, and most civil servants were removed from office. In the coming years, rising liberal and nationalist sentiment created popular opposition to the reconstituted clerical government. This led to numerous revolts, which were suppressed by the intervention of the Austrian army.

In November 1848, during the revolutions that swept Europe in that year, the assassination of his minister Pellegrino Rossi led Pope Pius IX to flee Rome. During a political rally in February 1849, a young heretic, the Abbé Arduini, described the temporal power of the popes as a &quot;historical lie, a political imposture, and a religious immorality&quot;. 

On 9 February 1849, a revolutionary Roman Assembly proclaimed the Roman Republic. Subsequently, the Constitution of the Roman Republic abolished papal temporal power, although the independence of the pope as head of the Catholic Church was guaranteed by article 8 of the . Like the other revolutionary movements of 1848, the Republic was short-lived; Rome was eventually conquered by the French Second Republic, which restored the papacy&#x27;s temporal power in the region once again.

In 1859–60, the Papal States were invaded by various republican forces seeking a unified Italian state, and lost the provinces of Romagna, Marche and Umbria. These regions were incorporated into the Kingdom of Sardinia (which thereafter became the Kingdom of Italy), and the papacy&#x27;s temporal power was reduced to Rome and the region of Lazio. At this point, some ultramontane groups proposed that the temporal power be elevated into a dogma. According to Raffaele De Cesare:

However, following the Austro-Prussian War, Austria was forced to recognize the newly-formed Kingdom of Italy. As a result, most clerics lost hope of a return of the former temporal power of the Bishop of Rome. Some, primarily Italian, clergy suggested an ecumenical council to dogmatically define papal infallibility as an article of faith, binding upon the consciences of all Catholic faithful. This doctrinal view, however, initially proposed by Franciscan partisans in opposition to the prerogative of popes to contradict the more favorable decrees of their predecessors, faced significant resistance outside of Italy prior to and during the First Vatican Council.

For practical purposes, the temporal power of the popes ended on 20 September 1870, when the Italian Army breached the Aurelian Walls at Porta Pia and entered Rome. This completed the Unification of Italy ().

<doc id="92922" wikidata="Q1084121" url="?curid=92922" title="St Kilda Football Club">
<text>The St Kilda Football Club, nicknamed the Saints, is a professional Australian rules football club based in Melbourne, Victoria. The club plays in the Australian Football League (AFL), the sport&#x27;s premier league.

The club&#x27;s name originates from its original home base in the bayside Melbourne suburb of St Kilda in which the club was established in 1873. The club also has strong links to the south-eastern suburb of Moorabbin due to it being the long-standing location of their training ground.

St Kilda were one of five foundation teams of the Victorian Football Association (VFA), now known as the Victorian Football League (VFL), and later became one of eight foundation teams of the original Victorian Football League in 1897, now known as the AFL.

St Kilda have won a single premiership to date, a one-point win in the 1966 VFL Grand Final against Collingwood. They have also qualified for the grand final on six additional occasions. The club has won the minor premiership three times, in 1965, 1997 and 2009.

St Kilda have developed a reputation as perennial underachievers, much of this attributed to their record of finishing last more often than any other club in the league (27 times), having the longest current premiership drought and fourth-longest in history (58 years), as well as having the second-lowest all-time win percentage of any team still playing in the league (after the Gold Coast Suns). Additionally, St Kilda have been the most significant beneficiary of AFL funding of the Victorian clubs in the decade up to 2022, and have gained the reputation of being a mendicant club as a result.

St Kilda are in an alignment with the Sandringham Football Club in the modern-day Victorian Football League. The club has fielded a women&#x27;s team in the AFL Women&#x27;s competition since 2020.

==History==
===1873–1915: early years===

On 14 March 1873, a meeting was held in Windsor to form the St Kilda Football Club. At this meeting, a provisional committee of men were elected. The formation was completed on 2 April 1873, and on 11 June 1873 another meeting was held to appoint the final committee. The club&#x27;s original home ground was colloquially nicknamed the &quot;Alpaca Paddock&quot;, which was a large fenced-off area at the St Kilda end of what is now known as Albert Park.

During its formation years, the club underwent multiple mergers. In June 1873, it merged with the South Yarra Football Club and adopted the red from their colour scheme. In 1875, the club briefly merged with University to stay financially viable. In March 1888, a decision was made to amalgamate St Kilda with nearby Prahran Football Club. St Kilda retained their colours, name and ground as well as picking up a number of Prahran players. St Kilda competed as a senior club in the VFA from 1877 to 1879, 1881 to 1882 and 1886 to 1896 before accepting an invitation into the breakaway competition, the Victorian Football League, from 1897 onwards.
St Kilda were one of the eight clubs that took part in the inaugural VFL season in 1897. They made their debut in an away game against Collingwood on 8 May 1897 at Victoria Park. The club&#x27;s home ground in the new league was the Junction Oval in the suburb of St Kilda, Victoria and the club&#x27;s first home game was against Fitzroy.

St Kilda&#x27;s early years in the VFL were not successful and, in 1899, they had the lowest score ever recorded in a VFL/AFL match, one point against Geelong. The club lost 48 consecutive games, recording their first win on 5 May 1900, against Melbourne. This match initially ended as a draw, but a protest launched by St Kilda saw the result overturned, resulting in a 1-point victory to St Kilda.

In 1902, Charlie Baker became the first St Kilda player to be the league&#x27;s leading goalkicker in a home and away season with 30 goals.

Six successive wins at the start of the 1907 season helped St Kilda to its first finals appearance, qualifying third with nine wins and eight losses. The club was beaten by eventual premiers Carlton. The following year, the club once again qualified in third position and were again eliminated by Carlton in the semi-finals.

The 1913 season saw major improvement with the team finishing fourth, eventually being defeated in the Grand Final by Fitzroy. Owing to the finals system at the time, Fitzroy, who had been defeated by St Kilda the previous week, were allowed to challenge St Kilda to a rematch the following week. St Kilda lost the rematch 7.14 (56) to 5.13 (43).

===1916–1949: World wars and individual success ===
Owing to World War I, St Kilda went into recess in 1916 and 1917. Just prior to their recession, the club temporarily changed their official colours to include yellow in place of white. This was done to avoid association with the German Empire, who had the same colours as St Kilda at the time. The club resumed normal operation in 1918 and fared well initially, qualifying for finals and being defeated in the semi-finals. However, the following years saw St Kilda consistently struggle with poor form.
The club qualified for finals once between 1919 and 1938, although during this time period Colin Watson became the first St Kilda player to win the league&#x27;s highest individual award, winning the 1925 Brownlow Medal. Additionally in 1936, forward Bill Mohr kicked 101 goals, winning the leading goalkicker award and becoming the first St Kilda player to kick 100 goals or more in a season.

The club qualified for finals in 1939, finishing the season in fourth after a record run of eight consecutive victories. The team had its first finals win since 1913, against Richmond, but were eliminated in the preliminary final by Collingwood.

St Kilda won three of the first four games early in the 1940 season and were on top of the ladder after Round 4, however, the club went on to finish second last. Despite prominent players emerging for the club such as Harold Bray, Keith Drinan, Peter Bennett and later Neil Roberts, St Kilda were rarely competitive for the duration of the 1940s.

=== 1950–1973: failure and success===
The 1950s were initially as uncompetitive for St Kilda as the prior decade. The club failed to make the finals for the first half of the decade, and won three wooden spoons over the period. At the end of 1955, Alan Killigrew was appointed as the club&#x27;s coach. As part of Killigrew&#x27;s plan to reinvigorate the club, 17 players were removed from the club&#x27;s list - one of the most substantial list turnovers in VFL history. Between 1957 and 1959, St Kilda won three consecutive Brownlow Medals. The 1959 winner, Verdun Howell, tied with Bob Skilton in the Brownlow Medal count. At the time, Skilton was awarded the medal on count-back. The league later decided to award a Brownlow Medal to any player who was eligible to win who tied on the same number of votes as a winner who won on count-back – with Howell receiving the Brownlow retrospectively.

In 1958, St Kilda won the Consolation Night Series competition, a competition that was played between clubs that had failed to qualify for the premiership season finals series. St Kilda defeated Carlton 16.13 (109) to 15.11 (101).

In 1961, after finishing sixth in 1960, Allan Jeans was appointed coach. In his first season as coach, St Kilda qualified for the final four for the first time since 1939. The club lost to Footscray in the first semi-final. The club qualified for finals again in 1963, but was eliminated in the semi-finals again. In 1965, St Kilda finished the home and away season as minor premiers for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. St Kilda defeated Collingwood in the second semi-final to progress into the grand final. The club finished second in the 1965 premiership season, being defeated by Essendon in the 1965 VFL Grand Final.

Following their successful 1965 season, St Kilda qualified for finals in consecutive years for the first time since 1907–08. The club was defeated in the second semi-final by Collingwood - however, the club defeated Essendon in the preliminary final in to qualify for the 1966 VFL Grand Final. St Kilda defeated Collingwood by a single point to win their first premiership in 68 seasons. 
The following year, St Kilda failed to qualify for the finals series, finishing fifth.

Despite continued finals appearances in the early 1970s, St Kilda was unable to win a second premiership - being defeated by the eventual premiers in each finals series between 1970 and 1973. During this 4-year period, St Kilda qualified for the 1971 VFL Grand Final. Despite leading by 20 points at the beginning of the last quarter, they were defeated by Hawthorn by 7 points.

=== 1974–1990: decline ===

In 1974, St Kilda declined to the lower half of the ladder for the first time since the 1950s, finishing tenth. Allan Jeans retired from coaching two years later after 16 seasons coaching St Kilda, citing burnout as his reason for retirement.

After Lindsay Fox was appointed club president in 1979, the club&#x27;s outstanding debt of $1.45 million was addressed. Many senior players and Allan Jeans accepted a deal to be paid 22.5 cents for each dollar they were owed. Additionally, non-football creditors received 7.5 cents for each dollar owed. The club was ultimately able to settle with its creditors for $195,000. Despite these efforts, continuing financial pressures and defeats saw the club remain in the bottom three for every season between 1979 and 1986.

In 1987, Tony Lockett won the league&#x27;s Coleman Medal for leading goalkicker in the home-and-away season, the fourth St Kilda player to achieve this. Lockett also became the seventh St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal. He remains the only person in league history to win both the league&#x27;s best and fairest Brownlow Medal and the Coleman Medal in the same season.

===1990–1999: AFL era===
The league was officially renamed the Australian Football League prior to the start of the 1990 premiership season.

A competitive 1991 AFL season saw St Kilda qualify for a finals series for the first time since 1973, qualifying fourth at the end of the home and away rounds. However, the club failed to win a final, being defeated by Geelong. St Kilda finally broke through the following year, winning its first finals series match since 1973 against Collingwood.

St Kilda won the 1996 Ansett Australia Cup competition, also known as the pre-season cup. The team defeated Carlton in the final 20.10 (130) to 10.12 (72) in front of 66,888 people at Waverley Park. Nicky Winmar became the first St Kilda player to win the Michael Tuck Medal for best player on the ground in the 1996 Ansett Australia Cup Final. Despite this success, the club failed to make the finals.

In the 1997 season, St Kilda qualified for the finals series in first position at the end of the home and away rounds with 15 wins and 7 losses, winning the second minor premiership in the club&#x27;s history. St Kilda defeated Brisbane in the qualifying finals and North Melbourne in the preliminary finals to move through to the grand final. St Kilda finished second after being beaten in the 1997 AFL Grand Final by Adelaide.

The 1998 season initially appeared to be equally strong for the club. After Round 14 of the season, St Kilda was on top of the ladder in Round 14 with eleven wins and three losses and were tipped as warm favourites for the premiership. However, the team&#x27;s performance declined severely, losing six of their final eight matches to from first to sixth at the conclusion of the premiership season. After qualifying for the finals in consecutive seasons, St Kilda were defeated narrowly by Sydney in the qualifying finals and then eliminated comprehensively by Melbourne in the semi-finals.

===2000–2011: wooden spoon to premiership contender===

During the early part of the decade, St Kilda struggled, winning only two matches and drawing one to finish with the wooden spoon in 2000. The following two years were similar, finishing second-last in both seasons. During this period, St Kilda recruited players such as Justin Koschitzke, Nick Riewoldt, Nick Dal Santo and Brendon Goddard who were mainstays of the team over the following decade.

In 2004, St Kilda won a club record of 10 consecutive matches from round 1 to round 10. The club returned to finals, eventually being defeated by eventual premiers Port Adelaide in a preliminary final. The following year saw a similar result, with the club being defeated in a preliminary final by Sydney.

St Kilda&#x27;s 2006 AFL season saw the club finish in sixth position at the end of the home and away rounds and qualify for a third successive finals series. St Kilda were eliminated by Melbourne in the elimination finals. During this season, Robert Harvey broke the all-time games record for St Kilda when he played in his 324th premiership season match in Round 7. On 11 October 2006, Ross Lyon was appointed as the new head coach for St Kilda, replacing Grant Thomas.

After missing finals in 2007, St Kilda again qualified for the finals in 2008. A 108-point win over Essendon in the final home-and-away round saw the club take fourth position for the finals series. St Kilda were defeated by Geelong in the qualifying finals, defeated Collingwood in the semi-finals and were eliminated by the eventual premiers, Hawthorn, in the preliminary final.

St Kilda&#x27;s 2009 season is considered one of the most dominant home-and-away seasons in AFL history. The club won 20 games—the best-ever home and away record for the club—as well as winning 19 games in a row before being defeated by Essendon. In Round 14, St Kilda defeated Geelong by six points, with both teams being undefeated prior to the match. The game broke multiple records, including highest-ever crowd for an AFL match at Docklands Stadium (54,444). The game was sold out two weeks in advance, causing a change in timeslot (moving from 2:10 pm to 3:10 pm) so that the Seven Network could broadcast the game live in Victoria.
St Kilda eventually progressed to that year&#x27;s grand final, when they were defeated by Geelong by 12 points. Following the grand final, Ross Lyon signed a three-year extension to his coaching contract until the end of the 2012 season.

The following year, St Kilda experienced a similar level of success, qualifying for the finals in third position. The club recorded their first win against Geelong in a finals match in the 2nd qualifying final and eventually qualified for the Grand Final against Collingwood. The match ended in a draw – the third drawn grand final in VFL/AFL history. St Kilda midfielder Lenny Hayes won the Norm Smith Medal for the player judged best on ground in the match, making him the first St Kilda player to ever win the medal. Owing to the draw, a second grand final match was played the following week. In the grand final replay, Collingwood won by 56 points.

In December 2010, the club was granted ownership of the Linen House Centre, a new training and administration property in the City of Frankston at Seaford valued at approximate $11 million. Following the season, the club announced a record net profit of $7.467 million for season 2010. St Kilda also achieved a new record membership for a single season and were the 2nd-most-watched team on television, rating 22,777,092 viewers across the season.

Following a loss in their 2011 elimination final, Ross Lyon left the club, despite one year remaining on his contract, to coach . Former Sydney, Fremantle and West Coast player and Collingwood assistant coach Scott Watters was announced as Lyon&#x27;s replacement in October 2011.

===2012–present: post grand finals struggles and rebuild===

The years after the departure of Ross Lyon did not prove fruitful for St Kilda. They failed to make the finals in 2012 for the first time since 2007 and continued poor performances that ultimately culminated in the club finishing last in 2014. Despite this, the 2013 season marked a historic moment for St Kilda and the AFL when St Kilda hosted the first premiership match outside of Australia in New Zealand. Following the 2013 season, senior coach Scott Watters was sacked. On 14 November, former Port Adelaide director of coaching Alan Richardson was announced as new senior coach for the next three years.

Following further poor performances in the 2018 and 2019 seasons, Richardson was advised that his contract would not be renewed for 2020. As a result, he resigned from his position as senior coach. Assistant coach Brett Ratten took over as caretaker coach. After winning three of the season&#x27;s last six games, Ratten was appointed permanent senior coach in September 2019. During the 2019 trade period, four high-profile players requested a trade to St Kilda and many discussions were held with other players looking to move.

In the COVID-19-shortened 2020 season, the club managed 10 of a possible 17 wins to qualify for their first finals series since 2011. During the finals campaign, St Kilda would defeat the Western Bulldogs in an elimination final by 3 points, bringing the first finals victory to the club since 2010 preliminary final against the same opponent. Richmond would later defeat St Kilda by 31 points in the semi-final, ending their campaign. In the following 2021 season, the club would decline in performance, leading to the club finishing 10th with only a 10–12 record. In the 2022 season, after starting at an impressive 8-3 record by round 11, the club would then win only three of their last 11, leading to an 11-11 record, finishing 10th once again. On October 14, 2022, senior coach Brett Ratten would be sacked by the club. Former St Kilda coach Ross Lyon would be reinstated as senior coach for the 2023 season.

In the 2023 season, Ross Lyon&#x27;s first season back as coach, St Kilda would return to the finals, finishing sixth with a 13–10 record. They would be defeated by Greater Western Sydney by 24 points in the elimination final.

=== AFLW involvement ===

In 2017, following the inaugural AFL Women&#x27;s (AFLW) season, St Kilda was among eight clubs that applied for licences to enter the competition from 2019 onwards. In September 2017, the club was announced as one of four clubs to receive a licence to join the competition in 2020.

==Club identity==
The club&#x27;s on-field nickname is the &quot;Saints&quot;, usage of which dates back to as early as the 1870s. Many clubs&#x27; early nicknames were derived from an abbreviation or demonym of the club&#x27;s suburb, but St Kilda is unique among the AFL clubs in now utilising this as its official nickname. Dating back to as early as the 1890s, and to as late as the 1950s, the &quot;Seagulls&quot; was also in use as a nickname, but this has fallen out of use. In 1945, the club adopted the moniker &quot;Panthers&quot;; however, this was short-lived.

===Guernseys===
St Kilda&#x27;s traditional and current home guernsey has three vertical panels of red, white and black on the front, with the club crest located on the left breast. The guernsey has a plain black back, white ribbing and white numbers. The away guernsey is similar. 

The current clash guernsey is similar to other guernseys but has extra white panels on either side of the red and black panels. The guernsey has a white back, with the tri-colour panels continuing below the number. It retains the white ribbing of the home guernseys and has black numbers.

====Evolution====
===Logos===
St Kilda has used multiple different logos since it was formed in 1873. Prior to 1976, no clubs in the VFL used logos in an official capacity.

Many early club logos were printed in the same shield design frame and had each club&#x27;s individual colours, name and design in them. St Kilda used a consistent design in the 1970s and 1980s, featuring a stick figure bearing a halo, holding the competition&#x27;s logo. In 1989, just prior to the league officially becoming the AFL, the club used a logo with a red white and black vertically striped design with the goal and behind posts on it, with a stick figure attempting a mark on it with a halo above its head, with the league logo and the club crest on top of either behind post. The VFL league logo was replaced with the AFL logo when the competition changed names in 1990.

The St Kilda Football Club crest first appeared officially on the jumper in 1933, after existing at the club for quite some time beforehand in basic design form. The crest became an iconic feature of the club&#x27;s jumper – a well-known and recognisable symbol of the club. The crest also includes the club&#x27;s motto, &quot;Fortius Quo Fidelius&quot;, which is usually translated as &quot;Strength through Loyalty&quot;. As with the nickname &quot;Saints&quot;, the club crest has no religious associations. A logo change before the start of the 1995 season saw the club make the decision to use the official club crest as the club&#x27;s official logo in the league. The club changed their logo at the end of the 2024 season to a more modern update of the 1995 logo, this new logo removed the club&#x27;s motto &quot;&quot;Fortius Quo Fidelius&quot;.&quot;

===Club song===
The club song is an adaption of &quot;When The Saints Go Marching In&quot;. The song was recorded in 1972 by the Fable Singers and released as a single. The song was recorded with all copyright and royalty agreements in place, and the AFL has permission to broadcast it publicly at each St Kilda match. Prior to 1965, when St Kilda played at the Junction Oval, the club&#x27;s song was an adaptation of &quot;I Do Like To Be Beside The Seaside&quot;.

===Home grounds===

==== Junction Oval: 1897–1964 ====
St Kilda&#x27;s first home ground in the Victorian Football League was Junction Oval. The club used this ground until 1964, when it moved to Moorabbin Oval. The oval was formerly known as the St Kilda Cricket Ground and was originally established as the home of the St Kilda Cricket Club in 1856.

By the late 1950s, the St Kilda Football Club sought to move its playing base away from Junction Oval as it wanted to operate its own venue rather than continue being a tenant of another club. In 1959, the club made enquiries about a lease to play at and develop Elsternwick Park in the neighbouring suburb of Elsternwick, but no deal was signed.

During 2014, St Kilda became involved in discussions with the Victorian government to return as a co-tenant at Junction Oval alongside Cricket Victoria. As part of the proposals, St Kilda would utilise the oval as a training and administrative base, with the site to receive a second oval to accommodate the club. This proposal was later rejected by the Victorian government, and Junction Oval was converted into a full-time cricket venue as of 2015.

==== Moorabbin Oval: 1965–1992 ====

Moorabbin Oval has been St Kilda&#x27;s training and administrative base since 1965, excluding an 8-year period between 2010 and 2018.

In March 1964, the club arranged a deal to move its playing, training and administrative base to Moorabbin Oval on Linton Street, Moorabbin, with all home games at the new venue starting from the 1965 season. The club signed a lease agreement in August 1964, giving the club access to all Moorabbin Oval facilities for 75 years provided it completed required works at the ground to establish a social club, training facilities and spectator seating on the site in time for the 1965 premiership season. The club had to invest a set amount, combined with funds from the local council, and complete the required works by a deadline date to ensure the agreement was ratified and the purchase was complete. Loans provided to St Kilda by the council were to be repaid over the subsequent lease period.

Following the club&#x27;s move away from Moorabbin Oval as a venue for playing games, it was retained as an administrative and training facility for the club. In 2007, the relationship between the club and the City of Kingston, which governs the suburb of Moorabbin, deteriorated. As a result, St Kilda announced that it would move its primary administrative and training base away from Moorabbin. After the 2010 season, the club temporarily moved to a new facility built at Belvedere Park in Seaford. During this time, the club continued to manage Moorabbin Oval, using it as a retail, museum, entertainment and occasional training venue.

In 2018, St Kilda returned to using Moorabbin Oval as their primary administrative and training facility, as part of a two-stage redevelopment deal, costing approximately 30 million dollars. Moorabbin Oval also serves as the primary home ground for the Sandringham Dragons and the Southern Football League as well as being the administrative centre for football development in the south-east.

==== Waverley Park: 1993–1999 ====

Waverley Park was opened by the Victorian Football League in 1970 under the name &quot;VFL Park&quot;. The ground was constructed by the league, for a variety of reasons, with the primary reason being that the ground would be owned by the VFL. As the majority of teams in the competition at the time did not have control over their home grounds, they were unable to exercise control over various aspects, such as ground drainage and ticket prices.

Since the 1960s, the AFL had been embarked on a strategy of ground rationalisation. During the 1990s, as part of this strategy, St Kilda opted to take a deal to move home games to Waverley Park from 1993 and renovate the ageing Moorabbin Oval for training, administration and social club purposes. The club voted in favour of the move in a weighted vote of members in July 1992. The club received $430,000 upfront and $120,000 per year for three years from the AFL&#x27;s grounds rationalisation funds, which helped to clear some of the club&#x27;s debt.

In 1999, the AFL announced that it would not schedule any further matches at Waverley Park and that the stadium would be sold to pay for the under-construction Docklands Stadium.

==== Docklands Stadium: 2000–present====
In 2000, St Kilda moved to a new playing home at Docklands Stadium following the discontinuation of Waverley Park as a scheduled ground.

Docklands Stadium was conceived as a multi-purpose venue to be used for Australian rules football, soccer, rugby and other general entertainment events. The AFL sought to replace Waverly Park, which would have been nearly 30 years old in 2000. The decision to build a new stadium was supported by the AFL due to issues regarding accessibility and Waverly Park, with the league stating there would be no improvement to the situation if upgrades were made to the stadium, and any upgrades would result in little financial return. The stadium was designated to be in the Docklands region of Melbourne, behind Southern Cross Station, and was designed to hold 52,000 people. The stadium cost approximately $460 million to construct. Exclusive ownership of the ground was later purchased by the AFL in October 2016.

Due to Waverley Park being disused following the construction of Docklands Stadium, St Kilda, alongside fellow tenants Hawthorn, were forced to find a new home ground. As part of the initial arrangement, both clubs were planned to play a significant number of games at the stadium, however, only St Kilda would move to the ground. St Kilda set the attendance record for the ground in 2009, when 54,444 people attended a match against Geelong, a match notable for being the latest meeting between undefeated teams in VFL/AFL history. Other former club players also hold records at the venue, with Lenny Hayes holding the record for most games played at the venue, and Nick Riewoldt holding the record for most goals kicked. To date, St Kilda has played the most AFL matches of any AFL team at Docklands Stadium, and has won the most matches of any AFL team at the ground.

During the 2021 and 2022 AFL seasons, St Kilda played one home game a year at Cazalys Stadium. Beginning with the 2023 AFL season, St Kilda have played one home game a year at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, with their remaining 10 home games played at Docklands Stadium.

==== Additional facilities ====

St Kilda&#x27;s primary administrative and training base from late 2010 until 2018 was the Linen House Centre at Belvedere Park in Seaford. The creation of the base came about due to disagreements between St Kilda and the City of Kingston&#x27;s council regarding proposed upgrades to their Moorabbin facilities, which included the implementation of 80 poker machines. The club subsequently negotiated a deal with the neighbouring City of Frankston to develop Frankston Park into its new training base. However, when proposed costs blew out by $5 million, a new agreement was formed between the two entities. In this new deal, the club would develop Belvedere Park in conjunction with the Frankston City Council, the Victorian state government and the AFL. The cost of developing the facilities was valued at approximately $11 million. The centre received its name as part of a naming rights sponsorship deal with Linen House.

The club signed a lease on the facility until 2059. The club, however, chose to relocate back to Moorabbin Oval as its primary administrative and training base by 2018. As a result, in December 2020, St Kilda made a proposal to the Frankston City Council to repurpose the facility as a centre to be used by the wider Frankston community.

==Playing squad==
===Current AFL squad===
===Reserves teams===
St Kilda operated its own reserves team from 1919 to 2000. From 1919 to 1991 the VFL/AFL operated a reserves competition and, from 1992 to 1999, a &quot;de facto&quot; AFL reserves competition was run by the Victorian State Football League. St Kilda fielded a reserves team in both of these competitions, allowing players who were not selected for the senior team to play for St Kilda in the lower grade. During that time, the St Kilda reserves team won three premierships (1942, 1943 and 1961). Following the demise of the AFL reserves competition, the St Kilda reserves team competed in the new Victorian Football League in the 2000 season before the team was dissolved at the end of the year.

In 2001, St Kilda entered a reserves affiliation with existing VFL club Springvale (which moved to Cranbourne and was renamed Casey in 2006). Under the affiliation, reserves players for St Kilda played VFL football with Springvale/Casey. The affiliation ended after the 2008 season and St Kilda then entered an equivalent affiliation with Sandringham which it still maintains as of 2022.

St Kilda had announced its intention to end its affiliation with Sandringham and re-establish its own reserves team in the VFL from the 2017 season after a redevelopment of Moorabbin Oval was completed; but the club ultimately extended and expanded its affiliation with Sandringham. From 2017, St Kilda has had a greater involvement in the operation of the VFL club and, from 2018, Sandringham plays three games per year at Moorabbin Oval in St Kilda colours. The two clubs once again strengthened the affiliation when in 2023, the Saints committed to providing integration opportunities for Sandringham players and coaches, as well as committing to rookie drafting a Sandringham player each year for the foreseeable future from 2024.

== Partnerships ==

=== New Zealand partnership ===

In September 2012, St Kilda announced that they had signed a three-year partnership with the Wellington City Council to play an annual match in New Zealand on Anzac Day (25 April) at Westpac Stadium as part of the day&#x27;s commemorations. As a result of the partnership, St Kilda and the Sydney Swans became the first two AFL clubs to play for premiership points outside of Australia. Although the partnership was extended by three years in 2013, a review conducted in 2015 saw the conclusion of the partnership.

In 2018, AFL New Zealand and St Kilda both expressed interest in signing a new partnership in the future with matches hosted in Auckland rather than Wellington.

=== China partnership ===

In October 2018, St Kilda signed a three-year deal to replace as &#x27;s opponents in their annual match played in China. The three-year deal was expected to earn St Kilda more than $2 million in addition to any commercial earnings. In 2019, 4.01 million people watched the match between the two clubs. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the match was not played in the 2020 or 2021 seasons.

==Commemorative boards==

===Honour board===

=== All-Australian teams===
An All-Australian team is considered a &quot;best-of&quot; selection of players for each calendar year, with each player usually represented in their own team position. The All-Australian teams are selected by a panel.
The concept of an All-Australian &quot;team of the year&quot; was first pioneered by &quot;Sporting Life Magazine&quot; in 1947, which created a team each year until 1955. No St Kilda players featured in these teams.

This concept was later adopted by the interstate carnivals and the Australian Football League. All teams from the interstate carnivals and the AFL have been endorsed as official by governing bodies of the sport, such as the Australian National Football Council and the AFL, whilst teams selected by &quot;Sporting Life&quot; are not recognised.

==Records and statistics==


==Reserves team==

The St Kilda reserves were the reserves side of the club, competing in the VFL/AFL reserves, as well as the Victorian Football League for a single season.

Since 2013, the club has been affiliated with the Sandringham Football Club.

===History===
St Kilda was an inaugural club in the Victorian Junior Football League, which later became known as the VFL seconds.

Their first premiership in the competition came in 1942, with another to follow in 1943 and a third in 1961.

The team were also runners-up a total of six times, including in the last AFL reserves grand final in 1999.

Shane Warne, considered to be one of the greatest bowlers in the history of cricket, played a single game for the reserves side in 1988. He was incorrectly listed in the Record as &quot;Trevor&quot; Warne, and played in the Under-19s for the remainder of the season. Former St Kilda number one ticket holder John Moran also played for the reserves side.

<text>In oceanography, the sverdrup (symbol: Sv) is a non-SI metric unit of volumetric flow rate, with equal to . It is equivalent to the SI derived unit cubic hectometer per second (symbol: hm3/s or hm3⋅s−1): 1 Sv is equal to 1 hm3/s. It is used almost exclusively in oceanography to measure the volumetric rate of transport of ocean currents. It is named after Harald Sverdrup. 

One sverdrup is about five times what is carried by the world&#x27;s largest river, the Amazon. In the context of ocean currents, a volume of one million cubic meters may be imagined as a &quot;slice&quot; of ocean with dimensions × × (width × length × thickness). At this scale, these units can be more easily compared in terms of width of the current (several km), depth (hundreds of meters), and current speed (as meters per second). Thus, a hypothetical current wide, 500 m (0.5 km) deep, and moving at 2 m/s would be transporting of water.

The sverdrup is distinct from the SI sievert unit or the non-SI svedberg unit. All three use the same symbol, but they are not related.

== History ==
The sverdrup is named in honor of the Norwegian oceanographer, meteorologist and polar explorer Harald Ulrik Sverdrup (1888–1957), who wrote the 1942 volume &quot;The Oceans, Their Physics, Chemistry, and General Biology&quot; together with Martin W. Johnson and Richard H. Fleming.

In the 1950s and early 1960s both Soviet and North American scientists contemplated the damming of the Bering Strait, thus enabling temperate Atlantic water to heat up the cold Arctic Sea and, the theory went, making Siberia and northern Canada more habitable. As part of the North American team, Canadian oceanographer Maxwell Dunbar found it &quot;very cumbersome&quot; to repeatedly reference millions of cubic meters per second. He casually suggested that as a new unit of water flow, &quot;the inflow through Bering Strait is one sverdrup&quot;. At the Arctic Basin Symposium in October 1962, the unit came into general usage.

== Examples ==
The water transport in the Gulf Stream gradually increases from in the Florida Current to a maximum of south of Newfoundland at 55° W longitude.

The Antarctic Circumpolar Current, at approximately , is the largest ocean current.

The entire global input of fresh water from rivers to the ocean is approximately .

<text>Johann Olav Koss (born 29 October 1968) is a former speed skater from Norway. He won four Olympic gold medals, including three at the 1994 Winter Olympics in his home country.

==Biography==
Johann Olav Koss was born in Drammen, Buskerud County, Norway. Johann Olav Koss became the Norwegian Junior Champion in 1987, but he could not compete with the world top skaters in the 1986 and 1987 World Junior Championships. In 1988, he debuted with the seniors at the World Championships in Alma-Ata, but failed to qualify for the final distance. The following year, he finished eighth in the same tournament (after a fifteenth place in the European Allround Championships), placing second on the 1,500 m. His breakthrough came in 1990, winning the World Allround Championships in Innsbruck, Austria. The following four years, he would win two more world titles (1991 and 1994), while finishing second in 1993 and third in 1992. He won the European Allround Championships in 1991 and finished second in the next three editions. Koss had a total of twenty-three World Cup wins, while winning four overall World Cup titles (the 1,500 m in 1990 and 1991, and the combined 5,000/10,000 m in 1991 and 1994).

Koss made his Olympic debut at the 1992 Winter Olympics, finishing seventh on the 5,000 m, five days after undergoing surgery because of an inflamed pancreas. He would recover to win gold on the 1,500 m (by only 0.04 seconds over his countryman Ådne Søndrål) and silver on the 10,000 m (behind Dutch skater Bart Veldkamp).

In 1994, the final year of his speed skating career, Koss also gained fame outside the speed skating world by winning three gold medals at the 1994 Winter Olympics in his native Norway, winning all races in new world records, two of which would remain unbeaten until the clap skate era. For his performance, he was named &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s Sportsman of the Year in 1994, together with Bonnie Blair. In addition, he received the Oscar Mathisen Award three times: in 1990, 1991, and 1994.

After his speed skating career, Koss trained as a physician at the University of Queensland in Australia. He became a UNICEF ambassador and a member of the International Olympic Committee (until 2002). He married Canadian businessperson and politician Belinda Stronach on 31 December 1999, but they divorced in 2003.

in 2000, Koss founded the Canadian-based International Humanitarian Organisation, Right To Play, which uses sport and play as a tool for the development of children and youth in the most disadvantaged areas of the world. The organization operates in more than 20 countries reaching over one million children each week and is supported by more than 620 staff worldwide and over 14,900 volunteer Coaches. In August 2015, Koss transitioned in to the role of Founder at Right To Play where he still stays very active in a variety of fundraising initiatives, and where he maintains his seat on the International Board of Directors.

He married his second wife, Jennifer Lee, in New York on 23 May 2009. Lee&#x27;s friend Chelsea Clinton was one of the bridesmaids. Lee is a Harvard College, University of Oxford, and Harvard Business School graduate, and a former cellist who studied at The Juilliard School. She is the granddaughter of Kim Chung Yul, the former Prime Minister of South Korea and Chief of the Korean Armed Forces during the Korean War. She is the co-founder of a retail business called BRIKA which sells products from under-the-radar artisans and makers. She is a former management consultant and most recently a private equity investment professional at Ontario Teachers&#x27; Private Capital in Toronto. They have four children together, Aksel, Annabelle, Andreas and Aleksander.

In November 2009, after American Peter Mueller was stripped of his coaching role with Norway for an inappropriate comment to a female team member, Koss was appointed head coach, despite no previous coaching experience. Association sporting director Oystein Haugen told Reuters that Koss has been a revelation despite no previous coaching experience.

Koss completed his Executive MBA at the Joseph L. Rotman School of Management in the University of Toronto in Canada. He has Honorary Doctorates from several universities - Brock University, University of Calgary, Vrije Universiteit Brussels, and the University of Agder in Norway. On 1 July 2015, Koss was made an Honorary Member of the Order of Canada (CM).

At the 2018 Olympic Games Koss was inducted into the Olympians for Life project for using sport to make a better world.

<doc id="92930" wikidata="Q3441366" url="?curid=92930" title="Ron Barassi">
<text>Ronald Dale Barassi (27 February 1936 – 16 September 2023) was an Australian rules footballer, coach and media personality. Regarded as one of the greatest and most important figures in the history of the game, Barassi was the first player to be inaugurated into the Australian Football Hall of Fame as a &quot;Legend&quot;, and he is one of four Australian rules footballers to be elevated to the same status in the Sport Australia Hall of Fame.

When Barassi was five years old, his father, Melbourne Football Club player Ron Barassi Sr., died in action at Tobruk during World War II. Barassi was determined to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps at Melbourne, and heavy lobbying by the club to recruit him resulted in the introduction of the father–son rule, still in use by the AFL today. Barassi subsequently lived with Norm Smith, Melbourne&#x27;s then-coach and a former teammate of his father. Under Smith&#x27;s mentorship, Barassi pioneered the ruck-rover position and appeared in six premiership-winning sides, two of which he captained. 

In 1964, in what has been called &quot;the most audacious signing in league history&quot;, Barassi left Melbourne for a lucrative contract at Carlton. Retiring from playing in 1969, he coached Carlton to two premierships, including a record-breaking grand final comeback in 1970 before what remains the largest crowd in football history; Barassi&#x27;s famous half-time injunction to his men to play on from marks and handball at all costs came to be remembered as &quot;the birth of modern football&quot;.
Barassi retired from professional football in 1971, but he was lured back two years later to coach North Melbourne. In 1981, after leading the club to its first two premierships, he returned to an ailing Melbourne, where he initiated the &quot;Irish experiment&quot;: the recruitment of Gaelic footballers into Australian rules. His stint at Melbourne, followed by another at the Sydney Swans in 1993–95, proved vital in rebuilding those clubs as viable members of the competition.

Barassi&#x27;s coaching career was both successful and regarded by many as revolutionary. His clean record and passion for the game―exemplified by his campaigning for the establishment of a national club-level competition―earned him a place as a celebrity and popular culture figure in Australia. He was named a Member of the Order of Australia in 1978, and in 1996 was selected in the AFL&#x27;s Team of the Century as a ruck-rover.

==Early life==
The only child of Ron Barassi, Sr., Barassi was born in the central Victorian town of Castlemaine on 27 February 1936. The following year, his father moved to Melbourne to play VFL football with the Melbourne Football Club. A pugnacious rover, Barassi&#x27;s father was a reserve in the Demons&#x27; 1940 premiership team before leaving to serve with the army in North Africa, where he died in the Siege of Tobruk. The young Barassi spent his early years in Guildford, Victoria. He was educated at Castlemaine Tech and then at Preston and Footscray techs in Melbourne.

Barassi was a third-generation Italian Australian whose Swiss Italian ancestors migrated to Victoria during the gold rushes of the 1850s and 1860s. They settled areas such as Guildford, Castlemaine and Daylesford.

==Australian rules football career==
Barassi unintentionally changed the game before he even took the field. After his father&#x27;s death at Tobruk in 1941, a group of players and officials at the Melbourne Football Club pledged to support his widow, Elza, and her young son. As a teenager, Barassi was determined to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps at the Demons, but the zoning system of the day required him to play for either Collingwood or Carlton.

===Father–son rule===

To ensure he played with the Demons, Melbourne went to the VFL and successfully lobbied for the creation of a father–son rule to allow clubs preferential recruiting access to the sons of players who have made a major past contribution to the team (50-game minimum at launch). When the time came for Barassi to be signed, Melbourne picked him from Preston Scouts in 1952 and he became only the second player signed under the new rule (after Harvey Dunn Jr). This rule, with some modifications and adapted to the drafting system created in 1986, endures to the present day in the AFL.

The club had gone to great lengths to recruit the young Barassi, and coach Norm Smith took him under his wing after his mother moved to Tasmania. Smith offered the 16-year-old use of his backyard bungalow. Looking back on the experience, Barassi believed that living with the man who was voted as the coach of the AFL&#x27;s Team of the Century had a profound impact on his development. On his website, Barassi wrote that:&quot;Norm Smith loved his footy. That suited me fine. His ability with young people, his strength of character, his ethics and values, came into my life at the right time.&quot;

===Melbourne years===

Melbourne Football Club was the dominant team of the 1950s. Under the coaching of Norm Smith, Barassi developed quickly. Barassi&#x27;s first game was against Footscray in 1953 in which he was shirtfronted by Footscray&#x27;s Charlie Sutton. Initially unsure as to Barassi&#x27;s best position, Smith played him as a second ruckman in 1954 despite his lack of size for the position. Barassi played more as a second rover, and the term &quot;ruck-rover&quot; entered the football lexicon. Within a few years, most teams imitated this structure, which ultimately paved the way for a new style of quicker on-ball play.

Barassi soon proved himself as an influential footballer, and he was quickly handed leadership responsibilities. In 1957, he was appointed vice-captain, and he was made captain three years later. After losing the 1954 Grand Final to a more experienced Footscray football team by 51 points, the Demons dominated the VFL by winning three successive flags in 1955, 1956, and 1957, with the team at the time hailed as the best to ever play the game. The image of Barassi breaking a tackle in the 1957 Grand Final is captured in Jamie Cooper&#x27;s painting &quot;The Game That Made Australia&quot;, commissioned by the AFL in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the sport.

===Carlton years===
A resurgent Carlton gave him a dilemma in 1964. New president George Harris was desperate to have Barassi at Princes Park, and he was willing to offer a lucrative deal for the time – a three-year contract of A£9,000 (equivalent to $151,320 in 2023) plus bonuses — if Barassi would cross to Carlton as captain-coach. Carlton offered Barassi a chance to test his skills as coach with a professional wage which would help with his children&#x27;s education.

Barassi joined Carlton in 1965. On his decision to leave Melbourne, Barassi said that &quot;Inevitably with many decisions in life there will be a downside. It is regrettable but you have to get on with things&quot;, he said. &quot;You have to ensure, as much as possible, that the decision you&#x27;ve made turns out right. Fortunately it worked out, and I&#x27;ll be forever grateful to Carlton for the start they gave me in coaching.&quot;

Barassi&#x27;s coaching at Carlton brought them from their lowest-ever VFL finish (at the time) to premiers only four years later. Drawing from his own experience under Norm Smith, Barassi forced his squad to become more disciplined and committed to the club—and their career. He preached and played a tough brand of football, and asked his charges to play a selfless, team-oriented style.

In 1968, he guided Carlton to its first premiership in 21 years. In mid-1969, he retired from playing, he had played one game and torn his hamstring, but continued as non-playing coach, ultimately going down to Richmond in the 1969 VFL Grand Final by 25 points; however, in the 1970 Grand Final, in front of the biggest-ever VFL crowd, he led Carlton to arguably football&#x27;s most famous comeback by defeating Collingwood, who were leading by 44 points at half-time.

After the 1971 season, Barassi left the Blues to focus on his business career. Despite not having played football since 1969, he signed to play with Port Melbourne in the Victorian Football Association in 1972, but he played only four games before suffering a hamstring injury and retiring.

===North Melbourne years===
Barassi returned to coaching in 1973. With administrators Allen Aylett and Ron Joseph, he recruited a new batch of stars for North Melbourne. Proven champions were recruited from clubs throughout the country, including Malcolm Blight, Barry Cable, John Rantall, Barry Davis and Doug Wade.

North Melbourne won the wooden spoon in 1972, finishing last. However, in 1974, in just Barassi&#x27;s second year of coaching the club, North Melbourne were to come runner-up in the 1974 grand final. Whereas Barassi had implemented a tough training regime in 1974, he modified this approach for the 1975 finals when he introduced lighter training sessions to keep his squad mentally-focused and not overtrained and exhausted. His strategy worked and they won the 1975 premiership.

North Melbourne went on to win another premiership in 1977, but they nearly squandered the flag as they gave up a late lead against Collingwood to create the second-ever drawn VFL grand final before coming back a week later to win the flag. In the drawn grand final, Barassi made major positional changes, including placing North Melbourne Team of the Century full-back and captain David Dench into the forward line, which sparked North Melbourne&#x27;s comeback to get back in front until Ross Dunne kicked a late goal to draw the game. Within a week, Barassi had picked his side up from this disappointing setback to lead North to a memorable triumph.

===Return to Melbourne===
In 1981, Barassi returned to Melbourne to assist long-term under-19 coach Ray &#x27;Slug&#x27; Jordon. The under-19s made three straight grand finals and won premierships in 1981 and 1983. Barassi laid some foundations for what would become a revitalised Melbourne side. &quot;In the five years we were there I think we raised the level of the club quite substantially. Melbourne reached the preliminary final two years after we left, and the grand final the year after that. I felt we did some of the ground work&quot;.

Barassi started the &quot;Irish experiment&quot; at Melbourne, which started recruiting Gaelic footballers from Ireland and converting them to Australian rules footballers. He recruited the most famous of all, the 1991 Brownlow Medallist, Jim Stynes.

===Sydney years===
In 1993, Barassi returned to coaching for the Sydney Swans. This was seen as a coup for the AFL given Barassi&#x27;s media skills and profile. In his three seasons in Sydney, he raised the profile of Australian rules football and the Sydney Swans in the rugby league–dominated city.

==Personal life==
On 4 March 1957, Barassi married Nancy Kellett, whom he had met at work four years earlier. They settled in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, at Heathmont, and had three children between 1960 and 1964. The couple separated in 1975 and Barassi married Cherryl Copeland (born in St Kilda, Melbourne) in 1981. They were married until his death in 2023. Both Ron and Cherryl were active supporters of the voluntary assisted dying movement.

During his coaching career at North Melbourne he survived a car crash, which caused life-threatening injuries and resulted in the loss of his spleen. His passenger, former St Kilda player and Brownlow medallist Neil Roberts, was also hurt. Barassi used a motorised buggy and a wheelchair for a short time. Despite this setback, he attended training nights at Arden Street and could be seen directing players with assistants.

Barassi&#x27;s first trip overseas occurred in 1961. He later travelled much of the world. In 1967, in New York City during the Australian Football World Tour, Barassi was involved in a fight in which detective Brendan Tumelty broke Barassi&#x27;s nose and both were sent to the same hospital. They were friends ever since.

Barassi moved to the suburb of St Kilda in the late 1970s and lived there until his death.

Barassi was a passionate chess player, playing many games of classical chess in the late 1970s over the phone with Brent Crosswell—a player whom Barassi was actively coaching—often for more than four hours at a time and lasting 50–60 moves per game. In a newspaper article, Crosswell humorously described how Barassi would psychologically break Crosswell down in over-the-board games by neglecting to bring him food or drinks and that “he would never provide chairs bearing any logical relationship to the table on which the chess set was placed”.

For many years, Barassi owned the Mountain View Hotel at 70 Bridge Road in Richmond. He sold it for $1.6 million in 2000.

For his 70th birthday he did a trek of the Kokoda Trail in Papua New Guinea.

On 28 February 2008, Barassi launched and signed his book &quot;Barassi&quot;, focusing on his personal life and scrapbook memoirs.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2008, Barassi was assaulted when he went to the aid of a young woman in St Kilda. Barassi, dining with friends, saw a woman punched to the ground around 12.30 am. In January 2012, Barassi suffered a bike accident, cracking three ribs. In September that year, aged 76, he went on to crew a yacht at Hamilton Island Yacht Racing Week with his friend John Bertrand. For his brave defence of the woman on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2008, Barassi received a bravery award in 2012 and a commendation for brave conduct in 2013.

On 16 September 2023, Barassi died following complications from a fall. He was 87.

==Cultural impact and legacy==

After retiring from coaching, Barassi remained a prominent Australian rules football celebrity and a figure of popular culture.

In 1996, he became an inaugural inductee in the Australian Football Hall of Fame, one of few former greats to be bestowed the honour of the &quot;Legend&quot; category. He is also one of only three Australian rules footballers in the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, alongside Leigh Matthews and Ted Whitten.

Barassi was involved in grassroots football development and was an advocate for the development of the game internationally, particularly in South Africa. Reflecting this, Barassi lent his name to the Barassi International Australian Football Youth Tournament.

Barassi was a supporter of Australia becoming a republic.

Barassi was one of the last runners in the Queen&#x27;s Baton Relay for the 2006 Commonwealth Games, being held in Melbourne, Australia, from 15 to 26 March. His section of the relay, run on 15 March, involved taking the baton from a series of pontoons in the middle of the Yarra River onto shore. It was handed to him by David Neitz, captain of the Melbourne Football Club (the team with which Barassi was long associated). This was accomplished by having Barassi walk on a pontoon that was submerged just beneath the surface of the water, giving the impression that Barassi was &quot;walking on water&quot;.

Barassi is the namesake of the Barassi Line, a concept originated by scholar Ian Turner to describe the geographical divide in Australia between Australian rules football and the two rugby codes. The line is imagined to intersect the border towns of Corowa and Wahgunyah, where, in 2014, Barassi attended the unveiling of a plaque commemorating the Barassi Line.

Robert Helpmann&#x27;s 1964 ballet &quot;The Display&quot; includes a lengthy football sequence for which Helpmann recruited Barassi to coach the male dancers in Australian rules. Barassi wrote the introduction to Philip Hodgins&#x27; 1990 poetry collection &quot;A Kick of the Footy&quot;. The frontman of satirical Melbourne band TISM went under the pseudonym Ron Hitler-Barassi. Barassi disliked the reference, saying &quot;My father was killed by Hitler&#x27;s men in Tobruk so you can imagine my displeasure.&quot; Artist Lewis Miller won the 2000 &quot;Sporting Archibald&quot; for his portrait of Barassi, which was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra. Barassi has appeared in the Specky Magee books. In 2015, Barassi collaborated with singer-songwriter Tex Perkins on the song &quot;One Minute&#x27;s Silence&quot;, a tribute to the diggers who died at Gallipoli. He was mentioned several times in episodes of the television show &quot;Kingswood Country&quot;. He was one of the first footballers to have his own football clinic on television and during the 1960s. He also launched his popular &quot;Ron Barassi&quot; footy boots.

In September 2003, a bronze statue depicting Barassi kicking based on a famous photograph was unveiled at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. 

After the second week of the 2006 AFL Finals, with the four remaining teams all being non-Victorian, and with Victorians reeling from their recent weakness, Barassi controversially called for an inquiry to unearth the reason Victoria was trailing in the AFL despite the state giving birth to the national competition.

In late 2006, he became a Sport Australia Hall of Fame member.

The best player in the Under-17 International Rules Series is awarded the Ron Barassi Medal.

Barassi was the subject of a series 2 episode of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;.

In 2012, Australian playwright Tee O&#x27;Neill adapted Barassi&#x27;s life into a theatrical performance. The play script was published by Currency Press.

A bronze bust of Barassi was unveiled in his hometown of Guildford to celebrate his 80th birthday on 27 February 2016 .

<text>Jean-Bédel Bokassa (; 22 February 1921 – 3 November 1996) was a Central African politician and military officer who served as the second president of the Central African Republic (CAR), after seizing power in the Saint-Sylvestre coup d&#x27;état on 1 January 1966. He later established the Central African Empire (CAE) with himself as emperor, reigning as Bokassa I until his overthrow in a 1979 coup.

Of this period, Bokassa served about eleven years as president and three years as self-proclaimed Emperor of Central Africa, though the country was still a &quot;de facto&quot; military dictatorship. His &quot;imperial&quot; regime lasted from 4 December 1976 to 21 September 1979. Following his overthrow, the CAR was restored under his predecessor, David Dacko. Bokassa&#x27;s self-proclaimed imperial title did not achieve international diplomatic recognition.

In his trial in absentia, Bokassa was tried and sentenced to death. He returned to the CAR in 1986 and was put on trial for treason and murder. In 1987, the jury did not decide on the charges of cannibalism because of a general amnesty, but found him guilty of the murder of schoolchildren and other crimes. The resulting death sentence was later commuted to life in solitary confinement, but he was freed in 1993. Bokassa then lived a private life in Bangui, and died in November 1996.

Bokassa was posthumously rehabilitated by President François Bozizé in 2010, leading to an upsurge in his popularity, despite his well-known crimes and extravagances.

==Early life==
Bokassa was born on 22 February 1921, as one of twelve children to Mindogon Mufasa, a village chief, and his wife Marie Yokowo in Bobangui, a large Mbaka village in the Lobaye basin located at the edge of the equatorial forest, then a part of colonial French Equatorial Africa, some southwest of Bangui. Mindogon was forced to organise the rosters of his village people to work for the French Forestière company. After hearing about the efforts of a prophet named Karnu to resist French rule and forced labour, Mindogon decided that he would no longer follow French orders and released some of his fellow villagers who were being held hostage by the Forestière. The company considered this to be a rebellious act, so they detained Mindogon and took him away bound in chains to Mbaïki. On 13 November 1927, he was beaten to death in the town square just outside the prefecture office. A week later Bokassa&#x27;s mother, unable to bear the grief of losing her husband, committed suicide. This left Bokassa an orphan at age 6.

Bokassa&#x27;s extended family decided that it would be best if he received a French-language education at the &quot;École Sainte-Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot;, a Christian mission school in Mbaïki. As a child, he was frequently taunted by his classmates about his orphanhood. He was short in stature and physically strong. In his studies, Bokassa became especially fond of a French grammar book by an author named Jean Bédel. His teachers noticed his attachment, and started calling him &quot;Jean-Bédel.&quot;

During his teenage years, Bokassa studied at &quot;École Saint-Louis&quot; in Bangui, under Father Grüner. Grüner educated him with the intention of making him a priest, but realized that his student did not have the aptitude for study or the piety required for this occupation. He then studied at Father Compte&#x27;s school in Brazzaville, where he developed his abilities as a cook. After graduating in 1939, Bokassa took the advice offered to him by his grandfather, M&#x27;Balanga, and Father Grüner, by joining the &quot;Troupes coloniales&quot; (French colonial troops) as a &quot;tirailleur&quot; on 19 May 1939.

==Military career==

The Second World War broke out in September 1939 following his enlistment. While serving in the second &quot;bataillon de marche&quot;, Bokassa became a corporal in July 1940, and a sergeant major in November 1941. After the occupation of France by Nazi Germany, he served with an African unit of the Free French Forces and took part in the capture of the Vichy government&#x27;s capital at Brazzaville. On 15 August 1944, he participated in the Allied forces&#x27; landing in Provence, France, as part of Operation Dragoon, and fought in southern France and in Germany in early 1945, before Nazi Germany collapsed. He remained in the French Army after the war, studying radio transmissions at an army camp in the French coastal town of Fréjus.

Afterwards, Bokassa attended officer training school in Saint-Louis, Senegal. On 7 September 1950, he headed to French Indochina as the transmissions expert for the battalion of Saigon-Cholon. Bokassa saw some combat during the First Indochina War before his tour of duty ended in March 1953. For his exploits in battle, he was honoured with membership of the Legion of Honour, and was decorated with &quot;Croix de guerre&quot;. During his stay in Indochina, he married a 17-year-old Vietnamese girl named Nguyễn Thị Huệ. After Huệ bore him a daughter, Bokassa had the child registered as a French national. Bokassa left Indochina without his wife and child, as he believed he would return for another tour of duty in the near future.

Upon his return to France, Bokassa was stationed at Fréjus, where he taught radio transmissions to African recruits. In 1956, he was promoted to second lieutenant, and two years later to lieutenant. Bokassa was then stationed as a military technical assistant in December 1958 in Brazzaville, and in 1959 after a twenty-year absence he was posted back to his homeland in Bangui. He was promoted to the rank of captain on 1 July 1961. The French colony of Ubangi-Shari, part of French Equatorial Africa, had become a semi-autonomous territory of the French Community in 1958, and then an independent nation as the Central African Republic (CAR) on 13 August 1960.

On 1 January 1962, Bokassa left the French Army and joined the Central African Armed Forces with the rank of battalion commandant under then-commander-in-chief Mgboundoulou. As a cousin of Central African President David Dacko and nephew of Dacko&#x27;s predecessor, Barthélémy Boganda, Bokassa was given the task of creating the new country&#x27;s military. Over a year later, Bokassa became commander-in-chief of the 500 soldiers of the army. Due to his relationship to Dacko and experience abroad in the French military, he was able to quickly rise through the ranks of the new national army, becoming its first colonel on 1 December 1964.

Bokassa sought recognition for his status as leader of the army. He frequently appeared in public wearing his military decorations, and in ceremonies he often sat next to President Dacko to display his importance in the government. Bokassa frequently got into heated arguments with Jean-Paul Douate, the government&#x27;s chief of protocol, who admonished him for not following the correct order of seating at presidential tables. At this time Mgboundoulou no longer advocated Bokassa&#x27;s status as leader of the army. At first, Dacko found his cousin&#x27;s antics amusing. Despite the number of recent military coups in Africa, he publicly dismissed the likelihood that Bokassa would try to take control of the country. At an official dinner, he said, &quot;Colonel Bokassa only wants to collect medals and he is too stupid to pull off a coup d&#x27;état&quot;.

Other members of Dacko&#x27;s cabinet believed that Bokassa was a genuine threat to the government. Jean-Arthur Bandio, the minister of interior, suggested Dacko name Bokassa to the cabinet, which he hoped would both break the colonel&#x27;s close connections with the army and satisfy the colonel&#x27;s desire for recognition. To combat the chance that Bokassa would stage a coup, Dacko created a 500-member &quot;gendarmerie&quot; and a 120-member presidential security guard, led by Jean Izamo and Prosper Mounoumbaye, respectively.

==Rising tensions==
Dacko&#x27;s government faced a number of problems during 1964 and 1965: the economy experienced stagnation, the bureaucracy was falling apart, and the country&#x27;s boundaries were constantly breached by Lumumbists from the south and the rebel Anyanya from the east. Under pressure from political radicals in the &quot;Mouvement pour l&#x27;évolution sociale de l&#x27;Afrique noire&quot; (Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa, or MESAN) and in an attempt to cultivate alternative sources of support and display his ability to make foreign policy without the help of the French government, Dacko established diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in September 1964.

A delegation led by Meng Yieng and agents of the Chinese government toured the CAR, showing communist propaganda films. Soon after, the PRC gave the CAR an interest-free loan of one billion CFA francs (20 million French francs). The aid failed to subdue the prospect of a financial collapse for the country. Widespread political corruption added to the country&#x27;s list of problems. Bokassa felt that he needed to take over the government to address these issues—most importantly, to rid the CAR from the influence of communism. According to Samuel Decalo, a scholar of African government, Bokassa&#x27;s personal ambitions played the most important role in his decision to launch a coup against Dacko.

Dacko sent Bokassa to Paris as part of the CAR&#x27;s delegation for the Bastille Day celebrations in July 1965. After attending the celebrations and a 23 July ceremony to mark the closing of a military officer training school he had attended decades earlier, Bokassa decided to return to the CAR. However, Dacko forbade his return, and the infuriated Bokassa spent the next few months trying to obtain support from the French and Central African armed forces, who he hoped would force Dacko to reconsider his decision. Dacko eventually yielded to pressure and allowed Bokassa back in October 1965. Bokassa claimed that Dacko finally gave up after French President Charles de Gaulle had personally told Dacko that &quot;Bokassa must be immediately returned to his post. I cannot tolerate the mistreatment of my companion-in-arms&quot;.

Tensions between Dacko and Bokassa continued to escalate in the coming months. In December, Dacko approved an increase in the budget for Izamo&#x27;s &quot;gendarmerie&quot;, but rejected the budget proposal Bokassa had made for the army. At this point, Bokassa told friends he was annoyed by Dacko&#x27;s mistreatment and was &quot;going for a coup d&#x27;état&quot;. Dacko planned to replace Bokassa with Izamo as his personal military adviser, and wanted to promote army officers loyal to the government, while demoting Bokassa and his close associates.

Dacko did not conceal his plans. He hinted at his intentions to elders of the Bobangui village, who in turn informed Bokassa of the plot. Bokassa realized he had to act quickly, and worried that his 500-man army would be no match for the &quot;gendarmerie&quot; and the presidential guard. He was also concerned with the possibility that the French would come to Dacko&#x27;s aid after the coup, as had occurred after one in Gabon against President Léon M&#x27;ba in February 1964; after receiving word of the coup from the country&#x27;s vice president, officials in Paris sent paratroopers to Gabon in a matter of hours and M&#x27;Ba was quickly restored to power.

Bokassa received substantive support from his co-conspirator, Captain Alexandre Banza, who commanded the Camp Kassaï military base in northeast Bangui and, like Bokassa, had served in the French Army. Banza was an intelligent, ambitious and capable man who played a major role in the planning of the coup. By December, many people began to anticipate the political turmoil that would soon engulf the CAR. Dacko&#x27;s personal advisers alerted him that Bokassa &quot;showed signs of mental instability&quot; and needed to be arrested before he sought to bring down the government; Dacko did not heed these warnings.

==Coup d&#x27;état==

Early in the evening of 31 December 1965, Dacko left the Renaissance Palace to visit one of his ministers&#x27; plantations southwest of Bangui. An hour and a half before midnight, Banza gave orders to his officers to begin the coup. Bokassa called Izamo at his headquarters and asked him to come to Camp de Roux to sign some documents that needed his immediate attention. Izamo, who was at a New Year&#x27;s Eve celebration with friends, reluctantly agreed and travelled to the camp. Upon arrival, he was confronted by Banza and Bokassa, who informed him of the coup in progress. After declaring his opposition to the coup, Izamo was taken by the coup plotters to an underground cellar.

Around midnight, Bokassa, Banza, and their supporters left Camp de Roux to take over Bangui. After seizing the capital in a matter of hours, Bokassa and Banza rushed to the Renaissance Palace in order to arrest Dacko, who was nowhere to be found. Bokassa panicked, believing the president had been warned of the coup in advance, and immediately ordered his soldiers to search for Dacko in the countryside until he was found.

Dacko was arrested by soldiers patrolling Pétévo Junction, on the western border of Bangui. He was taken back to the palace, where Bokassa hugged the president and told him, &quot;I tried to warn you — but now it&#x27;s too late.&quot; Dacko was taken to Ngaragba Prison at around 02:00 WAT (01:00 UTC). In a move that he thought would boost his popularity with the people, Bokassa ordered prison director Otto Šacher to release all prisoners in the jail. Bokassa then took Dacko to Camp Kassaï, where he forced the president to resign.

In the morning, Bokassa addressed the public via Radio Bangui: &quot;This is Colonel Bokassa speaking to you. At 3:00a.m. this morning, your army took control of the government. The Dacko government has resigned. The hour of justice is at hand. The &quot;bourgeoisie&quot; is abolished. A new era of equality among all has begun. Central Africans, wherever you may be, be assured that the army will defend you and your property ... Long live the Central African Republic!

==Early years of the regime==
In the early days of his regime, Bokassa engaged in self-promotion before the local media, showing his countrymen his French army medals, and displaying his strength, fearlessness and masculinity. He formed a new government called the Revolutionary Council, invalidated the constitution and dissolved the National Assembly, which he called &quot;a lifeless organ no longer representing the people&quot;.

In his address to the nation, Bokassa claimed that the government would hold elections in the future, a new assembly would be formed, and a new constitution would be written. He also told his countrymen that he would give up his power after the communist threat had been eliminated, the economy stabilized, and corruption rooted out. Bokassa allowed MESAN to continue functioning, but all other political organizations were barred from the CAR.

In the coming months, Bokassa imposed a number of new rules and regulations: men and women between the ages of 18 and 55 had to provide proof that they had jobs, or else they would be fined or imprisoned. Begging was banned. Tom-tom playing was allowed only during the nights and weekends. A &quot;morality brigade&quot; was formed in the capital to monitor bars and dance halls. Polygamy, dowries, and female circumcision were all abolished. Bokassa also opened a public transport system in Bangui made up of three interconnected bus lines through the capital city as well as a ferry service on the Ubangi River, and subsidized the creation of two national orchestras.

Despite the changes in the country, Bokassa had difficulty obtaining international recognition for his new government. He tried to justify the coup by explaining that Izamo and PRC agents were trying to take over the government and that he had to intervene to save the country from the influence of communism. He alleged that PRC agents in the countryside had been training and arming locals to start a revolution, and on 6 January 1966 he dismissed communist agents from the country and cut off diplomatic relations with the PRC. Bokassa also believed that the coup was necessary in order to prevent further corruption in the government.

Bokassa first secured diplomatic recognition from President François Tombalbaye of neighbouring Chad, whom he met in Bouca, Ouham. After Bokassa reciprocated by meeting Tombalbaye on 2 April 1966, along the southern border of Chad at Fort Archambault, the two decided to help one another if either was in danger of losing power. Soon after, other African countries began to diplomatically recognize the new government. At first, the French government was reluctant to support the Bokassa regime, so Banza went to Paris to meet with French officials to convince them that the coup was necessary to save the country from turmoil. Bokassa met with Prime Minister Georges Pompidou on 7 July 1966, but the French remained noncommittal in offering their support. After Bokassa threatened to withdraw from the CFA franc monetary zone, President de Gaulle decided to make an official visit to the CAR on 17 November 1966. To the Bokassa regime, this visit meant that the French had finally accepted the new changes in the country.

===Threat to power===

Bokassa and Banza began to argue over the country&#x27;s budget, as Banza adamantly opposed the new president&#x27;s extravagant spending. Bokassa moved to Camp de Roux, where he felt he could safely run the government without having to worry about Banza&#x27;s thirst for power. In the meantime, Banza tried to obtain a support base within the army, spending much of his time in the company of soldiers. Bokassa understood what his minister was doing, so he sent military units most sympathetic to Banza to the country&#x27;s border and brought his own partisan units as close to the capital as possible. In September 1967, he took a special trip to Paris, where he asked for protection from French troops. Two months later, the French government deployed 80 paratroopers to Bangui. Charles de Gaulle privately saw Banza as unreliable and believed him to have ties to the CIA. During meetings with Jacques Foccart in late 1967, de Gaulle expressed his wish that Bokassa should liquidate Banza instead of seeking reconciliation with him.

On 13 April 1968, in another one of his frequent cabinet reshuffles, Bokassa demoted Banza to minister of health, but let him remain a minister of state. Cognizant of the president&#x27;s intentions, Banza increased his voicing of dissenting political views. A year later, after Banza made a number of remarks highly critical of Bokassa and his management of the economy, the president, perceiving an immediate threat to his power, demoted him from his minister of state position. Banza revealed his intention to stage a coup to Lieutenant Jean-Claude Mandaba, the commanding officer of Camp Kassaï, whom he looked to for support. Mandaba went along with the plan, but his allegiance remained with Bokassa.

When Banza contacted his co-conspirators on 8 April 1969, informing them that they would execute the coup the following day, Mandaba immediately phoned Bokassa and informed him of the plan. When Banza entered Camp Kassaï on 9 April, he was ambushed by Mandaba and his soldiers. The men had to break Banza&#x27;s arms before they could overpower and throw him into the trunk of a Mercedes and take him directly to Bokassa. At his house in Berengo, Bokassa nearly beat Banza to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put on trial for appearance&#x27;s sake.

On 12 April, Banza presented his case before a military tribunal at Camp de Roux, where he admitted to his plan, but stated that he had not planned to kill Bokassa. He was sentenced to death by firing squad, taken to an open field behind Camp Kassaï, executed, and buried in an unmarked grave.

The circumstances of Banza&#x27;s death have been disputed. The American newsmagazine &quot;Time&quot; reported that Banza &quot;was dragged before a Cabinet meeting where Bokassa slashed him with a razor. Guards then beat Banza until his back was broken, dragged him through the streets of Bangui and finally shot him.&quot; The French daily evening newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; reported that Banza was killed in circumstances &quot;so revolting that it still makes one&#x27;s flesh creep&quot;:
==Rule during the 1970s==

In 1971, Bokassa promoted himself to full general, and on 4 March 1972 declared himself president for life. He survived another coup attempt in December 1974. The following month, on 2 January, he relinquished the position of prime minister to Elisabeth Domitien, who became the first woman to hold the position. He had earlier appointed the CAR&#x27;s first female government minister, Marie-Josèphe Franck, in February 1970. Over time, Bokassa&#x27;s domestic and foreign policies became increasingly unpredictable, leading to another assassination attempt at Bangui M&#x27;Poko International Airport in February 1976.

===Foreign support===
The Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi aided Bokassa. France also lent support; in 1975, French President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing declared himself a &quot;friend and family member&quot; of Bokassa. By that time, France supplied its former colony&#x27;s regime with financial and military backing. In exchange, Bokassa frequently took Giscard on hunting trips in the CAR and supplied France with uranium, which was vital for France&#x27;s nuclear energy and weapons program in the Cold War era. Bokassa restored ties with PRC and visited China in 1976.

The &quot;friendly and fraternal&quot; cooperation with France—according to Bokassa&#x27;s own terms—reached its peak with the imperial coronation ceremony of Bokassa I on 4 December 1977. The French Defence Minister sent a battalion to secure the ceremony; he also lent seventeen aircraft to Bokassa&#x27;s government, and even assigned French Navy personnel to support the orchestra. The coronation ceremony lasted for two days and cost 10 million GBP, more than the annual budget of the CAR. The ceremony was organized by French artist Jean-Pierre Dupont, and Bokassa&#x27;s ornate crown was made by Parisian jeweller Claude Bertrand. Bokassa sat on a two-ton throne modeled in the shape of a large eagle made from gilded bronze.

On 10 October 1979, the French satirical newspaper &quot;Canard Enchaîné&quot; reported that Bokassa had offered the then-Minister of Finance Giscard two diamonds in 1973. This soon became a major political scandal known as the Diamonds Affair, which contributed significantly to Giscard&#x27;s losing his reelection bid in 1981. The Franco-Central African relationship drastically changed when France&#x27;s &quot;Renseignements Généraux&quot; intelligence service learned of Bokassa&#x27;s willingness to become a partner of Gaddafi.

After a meeting with Gaddafi in September 1976, Bokassa converted to Islam and changed his name to Salah Eddine Ahmed Bokassa. It is presumed that his conversion to Islam was a ploy calculated to ensure ongoing Libyan financial aid. Issues arose when it became clear no funds promised by Gaddafi were forthcoming. The conversion also clashed with Bokassa&#x27;s plans to be crowned emperor in the Catholic cathedral in Bangui.

===Proclamation of the Empire===

In September 1976, Bokassa dissolved the government and replaced it with the &quot;Conseil de la Révolution Centrafricaine&quot; (Central African Revolutionary Council). On 4 December, at the MESAN congress, he converted back to Catholicism and instituted a new constitution that transformed the republic into the Central African Empire (CAE), with himself as &quot;His Imperial Majesty&quot; Bokassa I. His formal coronation took place on 4 December 1977 at 10:43a.m.

The coronation was estimated to cost his country roughly $US20 million – one third of the CAE&#x27;s annual budget and all of France&#x27;s aid money for that year.
His regalia, the lavish coronation, and generally the ceremonies adapted by the newly formed CAE were largely inspired by Napoleon, who had converted the French First Republic into the First French Empire.
Bokassa&#x27;s full title became &quot;Emperor of Central Africa by the will of the Central African people, united within the national political party, the MESAN&quot;.
Bokassa attempted to justify his actions by claiming that creating a monarchy would help Central Africa &quot;stand out&quot; from the rest of the continent and earn the world&#x27;s respect. Despite generous invitations, no foreign leaders attended the event. By this time, many people inside and outside the CAE thought Bokassa was insane. The Western press, mostly in France, the UK and the US, considered him a laughingstock, and often compared his eccentric behavior and egotistical extravagance with that of another well-known eccentric African dictator, Idi Amin of Uganda.

Tenacious rumours that Bokassa occasionally consumed human flesh were substantiated by several testimonies during his eventual trial, including the statement of his former chef that he had repeatedly cooked the flesh of human carcasses stored in the palace&#x27;s walk-in freezers for Bokassa&#x27;s table. Moreover, at his coronation Bokassa had reportedly told the French ambassador that the latter had eaten human meat without knowing it.
This did not affect Bokassa&#x27;s criminal record, however, since the consumption of human remains is considered a misdemeanour under CAR law and all previously committed misdemeanours had been forgiven by a general amnesty declared in 1981.

Bokassa claimed that the new empire would be a constitutional monarchy. In practice, however, he retained the same dictatorial powers he had held for the past decade as President Bokassa, and the country remained a military dictatorship. Suppression of dissenters remained widespread, and torture was said to be especially rampant. Rumours abounded that Bokassa himself occasionally participated in beatings and executions.

==Overthrow==
===Repression===

By January 1979, French support for Bokassa had all but eroded after food riots in Bangui led to a massacre of civilians. The final straw came when Bokassa tried to force all students in the country, from elementary school to university students, to wear uniforms made by a company owned by one of his wives. In response to this, students began protesting against Bokassa and by April 1979, the students and police &quot;were practically in state of war&quot;. Many students were shot dead by the police during these protests.

On 19 April 1979, there were mass arrests of students, who were taken to Ngaragba Prison, where approximately 100 students were beaten to death by the guards. Bokassa is alleged to have participated in the massacre. However, he denied these allegations. After the massacre, Bokassa was condemned by foreign governments and international organizations cut off aid.

===French overthrow of the empire===

The French intelligence service SDECE carried out Operation Caban on 19–20 September 1979 as the first phase of Bokassa&#x27;s overthrow. An undercover commando squad from the SDECE, joined by the 1st Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment, secured Bangui M&#x27;Poko International Airport with little resistance.

Upon arrival of two more French military transport aircraft containing over 300 French troops, a message was then sent by Colonel Brancion-Rouge to Colonel Degenne to trigger the second phase known as Operation Barracuda to have him come in with helicopters and aircraft. These aircraft took off from N&#x27;Djamena military airport in neighbouring Chad to occupy the capital city as a peace-securing intervention.

By 00:30 on 21 September 1979, the pro-French former president Dacko proclaimed the fall of the CAE and the restoration of the CAR under his presidency. Dacko would remain president until his own overthrow in a 1981 coup by André Kolingba. Bokassa, who was on a state visit in Libya at the time, fled to Ivory Coast where he spent four years living in Abidjan. He then moved to France, where he was allowed to settle in his Chateau d&#x27;Hardricourt in the suburb of Paris. France gave him political asylum because of his service in the French military.

During Bokassa&#x27;s seven years in exile, he wrote his memoirs after complaining that his French military pension was insufficient. However, a French court ordered that all 8,000 copies of the book be destroyed because in it Bokassa claimed to have shared women with French President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, who had been a frequent guest in the CAR. Bokassa&#x27;s presence in France proved embarrassing to many government ministers who had supported him during his rule.

Bokassa owned the Château du Grand Chavanon, a historic chateau in Neuvy-sur-Barangeon, from the 1970s to 1995. He rented it to the &quot;Cercle national des combattants&quot;, a non-profit organization run by National Front politician Roger Holeindre from 1986 to 1995, when the Cercle purchased it from Bokassa.

==Later life==
===Exile and return===
Bokassa had been tried and sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; in December 1980 for the murder of numerous political rivals. He returned from exile on 24 October 1986 and was immediately arrested by the Central African authorities as soon as he stepped off the plane in Bangui. He was tried for fourteen different charges, including treason, murder, cannibalism, illegal use of property, assault and battery, and embezzlement. Now that Bokassa was unexpectedly in the hands of the CAR government, they were required by law to try him in person, granting him the benefit of defence counsel. At Bokassa&#x27;s court arraignment, the 1980 &quot;in absentia&quot; verdict was overturned and a new trial was ordered for him. Bokassa pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against him.

===Trial===
Bokassa&#x27;s trial began on 15 December 1986, taking place in the Palace of Justice in Bangui. Bokassa hired two French lawyers, Francis Szpiner and François Gibault, who faced a panel modelled on the French legal system, composed of six jurors and three judges, presided over by High Court Judge Edouard Franck. The trial by jury of a former head of state was unprecedented in the history of post-colonial Africa, where former dictators had previously been tried and executed following show trials. In another regional innovation, access to the trial was granted to the public; this meant that the courtroom was constantly filled with standing-room-only spectators. There were live French-language broadcasts by Radio Bangui and local television news crews broadcast all over the country, as well as neighbouring French-speaking African countries. The trial was listened to and watched by many in the CAR and in neighbouring countries who had access to a radio or TV set.

Gabriel-Faustin M&#x27;Boudou, the Chief Prosecutor of the CAR, called various witnesses to testify against Bokassa. Their testimonies helped to document victims ranging from political enemies to a newborn son of a palace guard commander who had been executed for attempting to kill Bokassa in 1978; a hospital nurse testified that Bokassa had ordered the newborn&#x27;s death through poisoning.

Among the witnesses were twenty-seven teenagers and young adults who identified themselves as the only survivors of the 180 children arrested in April 1979. They had been arrested after children threw rocks at Bokassa&#x27;s passing Rolls-Royce during protests against the costly school uniforms which they were forced to purchase from a factory (supposedly owned by one of Bokassa&#x27;s wives). Several of them testified that on their first night in jail, Bokassa visited the prison and screamed at the children for their insolence. He was said to have ordered the prison guards to club the children to death; Bokassa allegedly participated, smashing the skulls of at least five children with his ebony walking stick.

Throughout the trial, Bokassa denied all the charges against him. He attempted to shift the blame away from himself to wayward members of his former cabinet and the army for any misdeeds that might have occurred during his reign as both president and emperor. Testifying in his own defence, Bokassa stated: &quot;I&#x27;m not a saint. I&#x27;m just a man like everyone else.&quot; Several times he erupted in rage, once attacking the chief prosecutor M&#x27;Boudou: &quot;The aggravating thing about all this is that it&#x27;s all about Bokassa, Bokassa, Bokassa! I have enough crimes levelled against me without you blaming me for all the murders of the last twenty-one years!&quot;

One of the most lurid allegations against Bokassa was that of cannibalism. Former President Dacko was called to the witness stand to testify that he had seen photographs of butchered bodies hanging in the cold-storage rooms of Bokassa&#x27;s palace immediately after the 1979 coup. Photographs apparently showing a fridge in the palace that contained the bodies of schoolchildren were also published in Paris Match magazine. When the defence put up a reasonable doubt during the cross-examination of Dacko that he could not be positively sure if the photographs he had seen were of dead bodies to be used for consumption, Bokassa&#x27;s former chef was called to testify that he had cooked human flesh stored in the walk-in freezers and served it to Bokassa on an occasional basis. The prosecution did not examine rumours that Bokassa had served some of the flesh of his victims to visiting foreign dignitaries.

On 12 June 1987, Bokassa was found guilty of murder in at least twenty cases and sentenced to death. The charge of cannibalism was not taken into account for the final verdict, since the consumption of human remains was classified a misdemeanour under CAR law, and upon seizing power from Dacko in 1981, President Kolingba had declared an amnesty for all misdemeanours committed before the start of his rule.

An appeal by Szpiner and Gibault on the grounds that the CAR&#x27;s constitution allowed a former head of state to be charged only with treason was rejected by the CAR Supreme Court.

===Imprisonment, release and death===
On 29 February 1988, Kolingba demonstrated his opposition to capital punishment by voiding the death penalty against Bokassa and commuted his sentence to life in prison in solitary confinement, and the following year reduced the sentence to twenty years. With the return of democracy to the CAR in 1993, Kolingba declared a general amnesty for all prisoners as one of his final acts as president, and Bokassa was released on 1 August 1993.

Bokassa remained in the CAR for the rest of his life. In 1996, as his health declined, he proclaimed himself the Thirteenth Apostle and claimed to have secret meetings with Pope John Paul II. Bokassa died of a heart attack on 3 November 1996 at his home in Bangui at the age of 75. He had seventeen wives, one of whom was Marie-Reine Hassen, and a reported fifty children, including Jean-Serge Bokassa, Jean-Bédel Bokassa Jr. and Kiki Bokassa.

==Legacy==
In 2010, President François Bozizé issued a decree rehabilitating Bokassa and calling him &quot;a son of the nation recognised by all as a great builder&quot;. The decree went on to hold that &quot;This rehabilitation of rights erases penal condemnations, particularly fines and legal costs, and stops any future incapacities that result from them&quot;. In the lead-up to this official rehabilitation, Bokassa has been praised by CAR politicians for his patriotism and for the periods of stability that he brought the country.

<text>In electronics, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC, D/A, D2A, or D-to-A) is a system that converts a digital signal into an analog signal. An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) performs the reverse function.

There are several DAC architectures; the suitability of a DAC for a particular application is determined by figures of merit including: resolution, maximum sampling frequency and others. Digital-to-analog conversion can degrade a signal, so a DAC should be specified that has insignificant errors in terms of the application. 

DACs are commonly used in music players to convert digital data streams into analog audio signals. They are also used in televisions and mobile phones to convert digital video data into analog video signals. These two applications use DACs at opposite ends of the frequency/resolution trade-off. The audio DAC is a low-frequency, high-resolution type while the video DAC is a high-frequency low- to medium-resolution type. 

Due to the complexity and the need for precisely matched components, all but the most specialized DACs are implemented as integrated circuits (ICs). These typically take the form of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) mixed-signal integrated circuit chips that integrate both analog and digital circuits.

Discrete DACs (circuits constructed from multiple discrete electronic components instead of a packaged IC) would typically be extremely high-speed low-resolution power-hungry types, as used in military radar systems. Very high-speed test equipment, especially sampling oscilloscopes, may also use discrete DACs.

==Overview==

A DAC converts an abstract finite-precision number (usually a fixed-point binary number) into a physical quantity (e.g., a voltage or a pressure). In particular, DACs are often used to convert finite-precision time series data to a continually varying physical signal.

Provided that a signal&#x27;s bandwidth meets the requirements of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem (i.e., a baseband signal with bandwidth less than the Nyquist frequency) and was sampled with infinite resolution, the original signal can theoretically be reconstructed from the sampled data. However, an ADC&#x27;s filtering can&#x27;t &quot;entirely&quot; eliminate all frequencies above the Nyquist frequency, which will alias into the baseband frequency range. And the ADC&#x27;s digital sampling process introduces some quantization error (rounding error), which manifests as low-level noise. These errors can be kept within the requirements of the targeted application (e.g. under the limited dynamic range of human hearing for audio applications).

==Applications==

DACs and ADCs are part of an enabling technology that has contributed greatly to the digital revolution. To illustrate, consider a typical long-distance telephone call. The caller&#x27;s voice is converted into an analog electrical signal by a microphone, then the analog signal is converted to a digital stream by an ADC. The digital stream is then divided into network packets where it may be sent along with other digital data, not necessarily audio. The packets are then received at the destination, but each packet may take a completely different route and may not even arrive at the destination in the correct time order. The digital voice data is then extracted from the packets and assembled into a digital data stream. A DAC converts this back into an analog electrical signal, which drives an audio amplifier, which in turn drives a speaker, which finally produces sound.

===Audio===

Most modern audio signals are stored in digital form (for example MP3s and CDs), and in order to be heard through speakers, they must be converted into an analog signal. DACs are therefore found in CD players, digital music players, and PC sound cards.

Specialist standalone DACs can also be found in high-end hi-fi systems. These normally take the digital output of a compatible CD player or dedicated transport (which is basically a CD player with no internal DAC) and convert the signal into an analog line-level output that can then be fed into an amplifier to drive speakers.

Similar digital-to-analog converters can be found in digital speakers such as USB speakers and in sound cards.

In voice over IP applications, the source must first be digitized for transmission, so it undergoes conversion via an ADC and is then reconstructed into analog using a DAC on the receiving party&#x27;s end.

===Video===
Video sampling tends to work on a completely different scale altogether thanks to the highly nonlinear response both of cathode ray tubes (for which the vast majority of digital video foundation work was targeted) and the human eye, using a &quot;gamma curve&quot; to provide an appearance of evenly distributed brightness steps across the display&#x27;s full dynamic range - hence the need to use RAMDACs in computer video applications with deep enough color resolution to make engineering a hardcoded value into the DAC for each output level of each channel impractical (e.g. an Atari ST or Sega Genesis would require 24 such values; a 24-bit video card would need 768...). Given this inherent distortion, it is not unusual for a television or video projector to truthfully claim a linear contrast ratio (difference between darkest and brightest output levels) of 1000:1 or greater, equivalent to 10 bits of audio precision even though it may only accept signals with 8-bit precision and use an LCD panel that only represents 6 or 7 bits per channel.

Video signals from a digital source, such as a computer, must be converted to analog form if they are to be displayed on an analog monitor. As of 2007, analog inputs were more commonly used than digital, but this changed as flat-panel displays with DVI and/or HDMI connections became more widespread. A video DAC is, however, incorporated in any digital video player with analog outputs. The DAC is usually integrated with some memory (RAM), which contains conversion tables for gamma correction, contrast and brightness, to make a device called a RAMDAC.

=== Digital potentiometer ===
A device that is distantly related to the DAC is the digitally controlled potentiometer, used to control an analog signal digitally.

===Mechanical===
A one-bit mechanical actuator assumes two positions: one when on, another when off. The motion of several one-bit actuators can be combined and weighted with a whiffletree mechanism to produce finer steps. The IBM Selectric typewriter uses such a system.

=== Communications ===
DACs are widely used in modern communication systems enabling the generation of digitally-defined transmission signals. High-speed DACs are used for mobile communications and ultra-high-speed DACs are employed in optical communications systems.

==Types==
The most common types of electronic DACs are:
* The pulse-width modulator where a stable current or voltage is switched into a low-pass analog filter with a duration determined by the digital input code. This technique is often used for electric motor speed control and dimming LED lamps.
* Oversampling DACs or interpolating DACs such as those employing delta-sigma modulation, use a pulse density conversion technique with oversampling. Audio delta-sigma DACs are sold with 384 kHz sampling rate and quoted 24-bit resolution, though quality is lower due to inherent noise (see ). Some consumer electronics use a type of oversampling DAC referred to as a 1-bit DAC.
* The binary-weighted DAC, which contains individual electrical components for each bit of the DAC connected to a summing point, typically an operational amplifier. Each input in the summing has powers-of-two weighting with the most current or voltage at the most-significant bit. This is one of the fastest conversion methods but suffers from poor accuracy because of the high precision required for each individual voltage or current.
** Switched resistor DAC contains a parallel resistor network. Individual resistors are enabled or bypassed in the network based on the digital input.
** Switched current source DAC, from which different current sources are selected based on the digital input. 
** Switched capacitor DAC contains a parallel capacitor network. Individual capacitors are connected or disconnected with switches based on the input.
** The R-2R ladder DAC which is a binary-weighted DAC that uses a repeating cascaded structure of resistor values R and 2R. This improves the precision due to the relative ease of producing equal valued-matched resistors.
* The successive approximation or cyclic DAC, which successively constructs the output during each cycle. Individual bits of the digital input are processed each cycle until the entire input is accounted for.
* The thermometer-coded DAC, which contains an equal resistor or current-source segment for each possible value of DAC output. An 8-bit thermometer DAC would have 255 segments, and a 16-bit thermometer DAC would have 65,535 segments. This is a fast and highest precision DAC architecture but at the expense of requiring many components which, for practical implementations, fabrication requires high-density IC processes.
* Hybrid DACs, which use a combination of the above techniques in a single converter. Most DAC integrated circuits are of this type due to the difficulty of getting low cost, high speed and high precision in one device.
** The segmented DAC, which combines the thermometer-coded principle for the most significant bits and the binary-weighted principle for the least significant bits. In this way, a compromise is obtained between precision (by the use of the thermometer-coded principle) and number of resistors or current sources (by the use of the binary-weighted principle). The full binary-weighted design means 0% segmentation, the full thermometer-coded design means 100% segmentation.
* Most DACs shown in this list rely on a constant reference voltage or current to create their output value. Alternatively, a &quot;multiplying DAC&quot; takes a variable input voltage or current as a conversion reference. This puts additional design constraints on the bandwidth of the conversion circuit.
* Modern high-speed DACs have an interleaved architecture, in which multiple DAC cores are used in parallel. Their output signals are combined in the analog domain to enhance the performance of the combined DAC. The combination of the signals can be performed either in the time domain or in the frequency domain.

==Performance==
The most important characteristics of a DAC are:
;Resolution: The number of possible output levels the DAC is designed to reproduce. This is usually stated as the number of bits it uses, which is the binary logarithm of the number of levels. For instance, a 1-bit DAC is designed to reproduce 2 (21) levels while an 8-bit DAC is designed for 256 (28) levels. Resolution is related to the effective number of bits which is a measurement of the actual resolution attained by the DAC. Resolution determines color depth in video applications and audio bit depth in audio applications.
;Maximum sampling rate: The maximum speed at which the DACs circuitry can operate and still produce correct output. The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem defines a relationship between this and the bandwidth of the sampled signal.
;Monotonicity: The ability of a DAC&#x27;s analog output to move only in the direction that the digital input moves (i.e., if the input increases, the output doesn&#x27;t dip before asserting the correct output.) This characteristic is very important for DACs used as a low-frequency signal source or as a digitally programmable trim element.
;Total harmonic distortion and noise (THD+N): A measurement of the distortion and noise introduced to the signal by the DAC. It is expressed as a percentage of the total power of unwanted harmonic distortion and noise that accompanies the desired signal.
;Dynamic range: A measurement of the difference between the largest and smallest signals the DAC can reproduce expressed in decibels. This is usually related to resolution and noise floor.

Other measurements, such as phase distortion and jitter, can also be very important for some applications, some of which (e.g. wireless data transmission, composite video) may even &quot;rely&quot; on accurate production of phase-adjusted signals.

Non-linear PCM encodings (A-law / μ-law, ADPCM, NICAM) attempt to improve their effective dynamic ranges by using logarithmic step sizes between the output signal strengths represented by each data bit. This trades greater quantization distortion of loud signals for better performance of quiet signals.

==Figures of merit==
* Static performance:
** Differential nonlinearity (DNL) shows how much two adjacent code analog values deviate from the ideal 1 LSB step.
** Integral nonlinearity (INL) shows how much the DAC transfer characteristic deviates from an ideal one. That is, the ideal characteristic is usually a straight line; INL shows how much the actual voltage at a given code value differs from that line, in LSBs (1 LSB steps).
** Gain error
** Offset error
** Noise is ultimately limited by the thermal noise generated by passive components such as resistors. For audio applications and in room temperatures, such noise is usually a little less than 1μV (microvolt) of white noise. This practically limits resolution to less than 20~21 bits, even in 24-bit DACs.
* Frequency domain performance
** Spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) indicates in dB the ratio between the powers of the converted main signal and the greatest undesired spur.
** Signal-to-noise and distortion (SINAD) indicates in dB the ratio between the powers of the converted main signal and the sum of the noise and the generated harmonic spurs
** i-th harmonic distortion (HDi) indicates the power of the i-th harmonic of the converted main signal
** Total harmonic distortion (THD) is the sum of the powers of all the harmonics of the input signal
** If the maximum DNL is less than 1 LSB, then the converter is guaranteed to be monotonic. However, many monotonic converters may have a maximum DNL greater than 1 LSB.
* Time domain performance:
** Glitch impulse area (glitch energy)

<text>The Don () is the fifth-longest river in Europe. Flowing from Central Russia to the Sea of Azov in Southern Russia, it is one of Russia&#x27;s largest rivers and played an important role for traders from the Byzantine Empire.

Its basin is between the Dnieper basin to the west, the lower Volga basin immediately to the east, and the Oka basin (tributary of the Volga) to the north. Native to much of the basin were Slavic nomads.

The Don rises in the town of Novomoskovsk southeast of Tula (in turn south of Moscow), and flows 1,870 kilometres to the Sea of Azov. The river&#x27;s upper half meanders subtly south; however, its lower half consists of a great eastern curve, including Voronezh, making its final stretch, an estuary, run west south-west. The main city on the river is Rostov-on-Don. Its main tributary is the Seversky Donets, centred on the mid-eastern end of Ukraine, thus the other country in the overall basin. To the east of a series of three great ship locks and associated ponds is the Volga–Don Canal.

==History==
The name &quot;Don&quot; could stem from the Avestan word &quot;dānu-&quot; (&quot;river, stream&quot;). According to the Kurgan hypothesis, the Volga-Don river region was the homeland of the Proto-Indo-Europeans around 4,000 BC. The Don river functioned as a fertile cradle of civilization where the Neolithic farmer culture of the Near East fused with the hunter-gatherer culture of Siberian groups, resulting in the nomadic pastoralism of the Proto-Indo-Europeans. The east Slavic tribe of the Antes inhabited the Don and other areas of Southern and Central Russia. The area around the Don was influenced by the Byzantine Empire because the river was important for traders from Byzantium.

In antiquity, the river was viewed as the border between Europe and Asia by some ancient Greek geographers. In the Book of Jubilees, it is mentioned as being part of the border, beginning with its easternmost point up to its mouth, between the allotments of the sons of Noah, that of Japheth to the north and that of Shem to the south. During the times of the old Scythians it was known in Greek as the &quot;Tanaïs&quot; () and has been a major trading route ever since. &quot;Tanais&quot; appears in ancient Greek sources as both the name of the river and of a city on it, situated in the Maeotian marshes. Greeks also called the river &quot;Iazartes&quot; ().
Pliny gives the Scythian name of the Tanais as &quot;Silys&quot;.

According to an anonymous Greek source, which historically (but not certainly) has been attributed to Plutarch, the Don was home to the legendary Amazons of Greek mythology.

The area around the estuary has been speculated to be the source of the Black Death in the mid-14th century.

While the lower Don was well known to ancient geographers, its middle and upper reaches were not mapped with any accuracy before the gradual conquest of the area by the Tsardom of Russia in the 16th century.

The Don Cossacks, who settled the fertile valley of the river in the 16th and 17th centuries, were named after the river.

The fort of &quot;Donkov&quot; was founded by the princes of Ryazan in the late 14th century. The fort stood on the left bank of the Don, about from the modern town of Dankov, until 1568, when it was destroyed by the Crimean Tatars, but was soon restored at a better fortified location. It is shown as &quot;Donko&quot; in Mercator&#x27;s &quot;Atlas&quot; (1596). 
Donkov was again relocated in 1618, appearing as &quot;Donkagorod&quot; in Joan Blaeu&#x27;s map of 1645.

Both Blaeu and Mercator follow the 16th-century cartographic tradition of letting the Don originate in a great lake, labeled &quot;Resanskoy ozera&quot; by Blaeu. Mercator follows Giacomo Gastaldo (1551) in showing a waterway connecting this lake (by Gastaldo labeled &quot;Ioanis Lago&quot;, by Mercator &quot;Odoium lac. Iwanowo et Jeztoro&quot;) to Ryazan and the Oka River. Mercator shows Mtsensk (&quot;Msczene&quot;) as a great city on this waterway, suggesting a system of canals connecting the Don with the Zusha (&quot;Schat&quot;) and Upa (&quot;Uppa&quot;) centered on a settlement &quot;Odoium&quot;, reported 
as &quot;Odoium lacum&quot; (&quot;Juanow ozero&quot;) in the map made by Baron Augustin von Mayerberg, leader of an embassy to the Tsardom of Russia in 1661.

In modern literature, the Don region was featured in the work &quot;And Quiet Flows the Don&quot; by Mikhail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov, a Nobel-prize winning writer from the stanitsa of Veshenskaya.

==Dams and canals==
At its easternmost point, the Don comes within of the Volga. The Volga–Don Canal, 101 kilometres (65 mi), connects the two. It is a broad, deep waterway capable of transporting oil tanker size vessels. It is one of two which enables ships to depart the Caspian Sea, the other, a series, connected to the Baltic Sea. The level of the Don where connected is raised by the Tsimlyansk Dam, forming the Tsimlyansk Reservoir.

For the next below the Tsimlyansk Dam, the sufficient depth of the Don is maintained by the sequence of three dam-and-ship-lock complexes: the Nikolayevsky Ship Lock (), Konstantinovsk Ship Lock (), and the best known of the three, the Kochetovsky Ship Lock (). The Kochetovsky Lock, built in 1914–19 and doubled in 2004–08, is downstream of the discharge of the Seversky Donets and upstream of Rostov-on-Don. It is at . This facility, with its dam, maintains a navigable head of water locally and into the lowermost stretch of the Seversky Donets. This is presently the last lock on the Don; below it, deep-draught navigation is maintained by dredging.

In order to improve shipping conditions in the lower reaches of the Don, the waterway authorities support plans for one or two more low dams with locks. These will be in Bagayevsky District and possibly Aksaysky District.

<doc id="92946" wikidata="Q1182626" url="?curid=92946" title="Defense of Marriage Act">
<text>The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was a United States federal law passed by the 104th United States Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on September 21, 1996. It banned federal recognition of same-sex marriage by limiting the definition of marriage to the union of one man and one woman, and it further allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages granted under the laws of other states.

Congressman Bob Barr and Senator Don Nickles, both members of the Republican Party, introduced the bill that became DOMA in May 1996. It passed both houses of Congress by large, veto-proof majorities. Support was bipartisan, though about a third of the Democratic caucus in both the House and Senate opposed it. Clinton criticized DOMA as &quot;divisive and unnecessary&quot;. He nonetheless signed it into law in September 1996.

Section 2 of the act allowed states to deny recognition of same-sex marriages conducted by other states. Section 3 codified non-recognition of same-sex marriages for all federal purposes, including insurance benefits for government employees, social security survivors&#x27; benefits, immigration, bankruptcy, and the filing of joint tax returns. It also excluded same-sex spouses from the scope of laws protecting families of federal officers, laws evaluating financial aid eligibility, and federal ethics laws applicable to opposite-sex spouses.

After its passage, DOMA was subject to numerous lawsuits and repeal efforts. In &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; (2013), the U.S. Supreme Court declared Section 3 of DOMA unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause, thereby requiring the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages conducted by the states. In &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; (2015), the Court held that same-sex marriage was a fundamental right protected by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause. The ruling required all states to perform and recognize the marriages of same-sex couples, leaving Section 2 of DOMA as superseded and unenforceable. On December 13, 2022, DOMA was repealed by the passage of the Respect for Marriage Act which was signed into law by President Joe Biden, who had previously voted in favor of DOMA as a Senator from Delaware.

==Background==
The issue of legal recognition of same-sex marriage attracted mainstream attention infrequently until the 1980s. A sympathetic reporter heard several gay men raise the issue in 1967 and described it as &quot;high among the deviate&#x27;s hopes&quot;. In one early incident, gay activist Jack Baker brought suit against the state of Minnesota in 1970 after being denied a marriage license to marry another man; the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled (in &quot;Baker v. Nelson&quot;) that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples did not violate the Constitution. Baker later changed his legal name to Pat Lynn McConnell and married his male partner in 1971, but the marriage was not legally recognized. A 1972 off-Broadway play, &quot;Nightride&quot;, depicted &quot;a black–white homosexual marriage&quot;. In 1979, IntegrityUSA, an organization of gay Episcopalians, raised the issue when the U.S. Episcopal Church considered a ban on the ordination of homosexuals as priests.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; said the question was &quot;all but dormant&quot; until the late 1980s when, according to gay activists, &quot;the AIDS epidemic... brought questions of inheritance and death benefits to many people&#x27;s minds.&quot; In May 1989, Denmark established registered partnerships that granted same-sex couples many of the rights associated with marriage. In the same year, New York&#x27;s highest court ruled that two homosexual men qualified as a family for the purposes of New York City&#x27;s rent-control regulations. Within the movement for gay and lesbian rights, a debate between advocates of sexual liberation and of social integration was taking shape, with Andrew Sullivan publishing an essay &quot;Here Comes the Groom&quot; in &quot;The New Republic&quot; in August 1989 arguing for same-sex marriage: &quot;A need to rebel has quietly ceded to a desire to belong.&quot; In September 1989, the State Bar Association of California urged recognition of marriages between homosexuals even before gay rights advocates adopted the issue.

Gary Bauer, head of the socially conservative Family Research Council, predicted in 1989 that the issue would be &quot;a major battleground in the 1990s&quot;. In 1991, Georgia Attorney General Michael J. Bowers (who had previously been the defendant in a failed Supreme Court challenge to a law that criminalized homosexuality) withdrew a job offer to a lesbian who planned to marry another woman in a Jewish wedding ceremony. In 1993, a committee of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America released a report asking Lutherans to consider blessing same-sex marriages and stating that lifelong abstinence was harmful to same-sex couples. The Conference of Bishops responded, &quot;There is basis neither in Scripture nor tradition for the establishment of an official ceremony by this church for the blessing of a homosexual relationship.&quot; In a critique of radicalism in the gay liberation movement, Bruce Bawer&#x27;s &quot;A Place at the Table&quot; (1993) advocated the legalization of same-sex marriage. 

In &quot;Baehr v. Miike&quot; (1993), the Supreme Court of Hawaii ruled that preventing same-sex couples from obtaining marriage licenses was sex discrimination. Thus, the court found that the Hawaii State Constitution required the state to demonstrate that its opposite-sex marriage definition satisfied the legal standard known as strict scrutiny. This ruling prompted concern among opponents of same-sex marriage, who feared that same-sex marriage might become legal in Hawaii and that other states would recognize or be compelled to recognize those marriages under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. The House Judiciary Committee&#x27;s 1996 Report called for DOMA as a response to &quot;Baehr&quot;, because &quot;a redefinition of marriage in Hawaii to include homosexual couples could make such couples eligible for a whole range of federal rights and benefits&quot;.

==Text==
The main provisions of the act were as follows:

; Section 1. Short title
: This Act may be cited as the &quot;Defense of Marriage Act&quot;.
; Section 2. Powers reserved to the states
: No State, territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian tribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such relationship.
; Section 3. Definition of marriage
: In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the word &#x27;marriage&#x27; means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word &#x27;spouse&#x27; refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.

==Enactment and role of President Clinton==
Georgia Representative Bob Barr, then a Republican, authored the Defense of Marriage Act and introduced it in the House of Representatives on May 7, 1996. Senator Don Nickles, (R-OK), introduced the bill in the Senate. The House Judiciary Committee stated that the Act was intended by Congress to &quot;reflect and honor a collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality&quot;. The Act&#x27;s congressional sponsors stated, &quot;[T]he bill amends the U.S. Code to make explicit what has been understood under federal law for over 200 years; that a marriage is the legal union of a man and a woman as husband and wife, and a spouse is a husband or wife of the opposite sex.&quot;

Nickles said, &quot;If some state wishes to recognize same-sex marriage, they can do so&quot;. He said the bill would ensure that &quot;the 49 other states don&#x27;t have to and the Federal Government does not have to.&quot; In opposition to the bill, Colorado Rep. Patricia Schroeder said, &quot;You can&#x27;t amend the Constitution with a statute. Everybody knows that. This is just stirring the political waters and seeing what hate you can unleash.&quot; Barr countered that the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution grants Congress power to determine &quot;the effect&quot; of the obligation of each state to grant &quot;full faith and credit&quot; to other states&#x27; acts.

The 1996 Republican Party platform endorsed DOMA, referencing only Section 2 of the act: &quot;We reject the distortion of [anti-discrimination] laws to cover sexual preference, and we endorse the Defense of Marriage Act to prevent states from being forced to recognize same-sex unions.&quot; The Democratic Party platform that year did not mention DOMA or same-sex marriage. In a June 1996 interview in the gay and lesbian magazine &quot;The Advocate&quot;, Clinton said, &quot;I remain opposed to same-sex marriage. I believe marriage is an institution for the union of a man and a woman. This has been my long-standing position, and it is not being reviewed or reconsidered.&quot; However, he also criticized DOMA as unnecessary and divisive.

The bill moved through Congress on a legislative fast track and met with overwhelming approval in both houses of the Republican-controlled Congress. On July 12, 1996, with only 65 Democrats and then Rep. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Steve Gunderson (R-WI), in opposition, 342 members of the U.S. House of Representatives—224 Republicans and 118 Democrats—voted to pass DOMA. On September 10, 1996, 84 Senators, a majority of the Democratic Senators, including Joe Biden, and all of the Republicans—voted in favor of DOMA. Democratic Senators voted for the bill 32 to 14 (with Pryor of Arkansas absent), and Democratic Representatives voted for it 118 to 65, with 15 not participating. All Republicans in both houses voted for the bill with the sole exception of the one openly gay Republican Congressman, Rep. Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin.

After Congress had passed DOMA with veto-proof majorities in both houses, Clinton signed the bill into law on September 21, 1996 late at night behind closed doors. Clinton, who was traveling when Congress acted, signed it into law promptly upon returning to Washington, D.C.; no signing ceremony was held for DOMA and no photographs were taken of Clinton signing it. The White House released a statement in which Clinton said &quot;that the enactment of this legislation should not, despite the fierce and at times divisive rhetoric surrounding it, be understood to provide an excuse for discrimination, violence or intimidation against any person on the basis of sexual orientation&quot;.

In 2013, Mike McCurry, the White House press secretary at the time, recalled that Clinton&#x27;s &quot;posture was quite frankly driven by the political realities of an election year in 1996.&quot; James Hormel, who was appointed by Clinton as the first openly gay U.S. Ambassador, described the reaction from the gay community to Clinton signing DOMA as shock and anger. 

Following the signing of DOMA, Clinton&#x27;s public position on same-sex marriage shifted. He spoke out against the passage of California&#x27;s Proposition 8 and recorded robocalls urging Californians to vote against it. In July 2009, he came out in support of same-sex marriage.

Years later, Clinton claimed that he signed DOMA reluctantly in view of the veto-proof congressional majorities in support of the bill, and that he did so to avoid associating himself politically with the then-unpopular cause of same-sex marriage and to defuse momentum for a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution banning same-sex marriage. Even so, later the same year, Clinton ran ads on Christian radio stations nationwide promoting his signing of the legislation. The ads were pulled after massive blowback from LGBT groups. Clinton&#x27;s explanation for signing DOMA has been disputed by gay rights activists Elizabeth Birch and Evan Wolfson.

==Impact==
The General Accounting Office issued a report in 1997 identifying &quot;1,049 federal statutory provisions classified to the United States Code in which benefits, rights, and privileges are contingent on marital status or in which marital status is a factor&quot;. In updating its report in 2004, the GAO found that this number had risen to 1,138 as of December 31, 2003. With respect to Social Security, housing, and food stamps, the GAO found that &quot;recognition of the marital relationship is integral to the design of the program[s].&quot; The report also noted several other major program categories that were affected—veterans&#x27; benefits, including pensions and survivor benefits; taxes on income, estates, gifts, and property sales; and benefits due federal employees, both civilian and military—and identified specifics such as the rights of the surviving spouse of a creator of copyrighted work and the financial disclosure requirements of spouses of Congress members and certain officers of the federal government. Education loan programs and agriculture price support and loan programs also implicate spouses. Financial aid to &quot;family farms&quot; for example, is restricted to those in which &quot;a majority interest is held by individuals related by marriage or blood.&quot;

Because the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) controls most employee benefits provided by private employers, DOMA removed some tax breaks for employers and employees in the private sector when it comes to health care, pension, and disability benefits to same-sex spouses on an equal footing with opposite-sex spouses. ERISA does not affect employees of state and local government or churches, nor does it extend to such benefits as employee leave and vacation.

Under DOMA, persons in same-sex marriages were not considered married for immigration purposes. U.S. citizens and permanent residents in same-sex marriages could not petition for their spouses, nor could they be accompanied by their spouses into the U.S. on the basis of a family or employment-based visa. A non-citizen in such a marriage could not use it as the basis for obtaining a waiver or relief from removal from the U.S.

Following the end of the U.S. military&#x27;s ban on service by open gays and lesbians, &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell,&quot; in September 2011, Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, noted that DOMA limited the military&#x27;s ability to extend the same benefits to military personnel in same-sex marriages as their peers in opposite-sex marriages received, notably health benefits. Same-sex spouses of military personnel were denied the same access to military bases, legal counseling, and housing allowances provided to different-sex spouses.

==Political debate==
The 2000 Republican Party platform endorsed DOMA in general terms and indicated concern about judicial activism: &quot;We support the traditional definition of &#x27;marriage&#x27; as the legal union of one man and one woman, and we believe that federal judges and bureaucrats should not force states to recognize other living arrangements as marriages.&quot; The Democratic Party platform that year did not mention DOMA or marriage in this context.

===Bush administration===
In 2004, President George W. Bush endorsed a proposed constitutional amendment to restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples because he found DOMA to be vulnerable: &quot;After more than two centuries of American jurisprudence and millennia of human experience, a few judges and local authorities are presuming to change the most fundamental institution of civilization. Their actions have created confusion on an issue that requires clarity.&quot; In January 2005, however, he said he would not lobby on its behalf, since too many U.S. senators thought DOMA would not survive a constitutional challenge.

===Obama administration===
President Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 political platform endorsed the repeal of DOMA. On June 12, 2009, the Justice Department issued a brief defending the constitutionality of DOMA in the case of &quot;Smelt v. United States&quot;, continuing its longstanding practice of defending all federal laws challenged in court. On June 15, 2009, Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese wrote an open letter to Obama that asked for actions to balance the DOJ&#x27;s courtroom position: &quot;We call on you to put your principles into action and send legislation repealing DOMA to Congress.&quot; A representative of Lambda Legal, an LGBT impact litigation and advocacy organization, noted that the Obama administration&#x27;s legal arguments omitted the Bush administration&#x27;s assertion that households headed by opposite-sex spouses were better at raising children than those headed by same-sex spouses.

On February 23, 2011, Attorney General Eric Holder released a statement regarding lawsuits challenging DOMA Section 3. He wrote:

After careful consideration, including a review of my recommendation, the President has concluded that given a number of factors, including a documented history of discrimination, classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to a more heightened standard of scrutiny. The President has also concluded that Section 3 of DOMA, as applied to legally married same-sex couples, fails to meet that standard and is therefore unconstitutional. Given that conclusion, the President has instructed the Department not to defend the statute in such cases.

He also announced that although it was no longer defending Section 3 in court, the administration intended to continue to enforce the law &quot;unless and until Congress repeals Section 3 or the judicial branch renders a definitive verdict against the law&#x27;s constitutionality.&quot;

In a separate letter to Speaker of the House John Boehner, Holder noted that Congress could participate in these lawsuits.

On February 24, the Department of Justice notified the First Circuit Court of Appeals that it would &quot;cease to defend&quot; &quot;Gill&quot; and &quot;Massachusetts&quot; as well. On July 1, 2011, the DOJ, with a filing in &quot;Golinski&quot;, intervened for the first time on behalf of a plaintiff seeking to have DOMA Section 3 ruled unconstitutional, arguing that laws that use sexual orientation as a classification need to pass the court&#x27;s intermediate scrutiny standard of review. The DOJ made similar arguments in a filing in &quot;Gill&quot; on July 7.

In June 2012, filing an amicus brief in &quot;Golinski&quot;, two former Republican Attorneys General, Edwin Meese and John Ashcroft, called the DOJ&#x27;s decision not to defend DOMA Section 3 &quot;an unprecedented and ill-advised departure from over two centuries of Executive Branch practice&quot; and &quot;an extreme and unprecedented deviation from the historical norm&quot;.

===Congressional intervention===
On March 4, 2011, Boehner announced that the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) would convene to consider whether the House of Representatives should defend DOMA Section 3 in place of the Department of Justice, and on March 9 the committee voted 3–2 to do so.

On April 18, 2011, House leaders announced the selection of former United States Solicitor General Paul Clement to represent BLAG. Clement, without opposition from other parties to the case, filed a motion to be allowed to intervene in the suit &quot;for the limited purpose of defending the constitutionality of Section III&quot; of DOMA. On April 25, 2011, King &amp; Spalding, the law firm through which Clement was handling the case, announced it was dropping the case. On the same day, Clement resigned from King &amp; Spalding in protest and joined Bancroft PLLC, which took on the case. The House&#x27;s initial contract with Clement capped legal fees at $500,000, but on September 30 a revised contract raised the cap to $1.5 million. A spokesman for Boehner explained that BLAG would not appeal in all cases, citing bankruptcy cases that are &quot;unlikely to provide the path to the Supreme Court...[E]ffectively defending [DOMA] does not require the House to intervene in every case, especially when doing so would be prohibitively expensive.&quot;

==Challenges to Section 3 in Federal court==
Numerous plaintiffs have challenged DOMA. Prior to 2009, all federal courts upheld DOMA in its entirety.

Later cases focused on Section 3&#x27;s definition of marriage. The courts, using different standards, have all found Section 3 unconstitutional. Requests for the Supreme Court to hear appeals were filed in five cases, listed below (with Supreme Court docket numbers):
* &quot;Gill v. Office of Personnel Management&quot; (12-13 as &quot;BLAG v. Gill&quot;)
* &quot;Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human Services&quot; (12-15 as &quot;Dept. of HHS v. Massachusetts&quot;, 12-97)
* &quot;Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management&quot; (12-16 &quot;OPM v. Golinski&quot;)
* &quot;Windsor v. United States&quot; (12-63)
* &quot;Pedersen v. Office of Personnel Management&quot; (12-231)

===&quot;Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management&quot;===
&quot;Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management&quot; was a challenge to Section 3 of DOMA in federal court based on a judicial employee&#x27;s attempt to receive spousal health benefits for her partner. In 2008, Karen Golinski, a 19-year employee of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, applied for health benefits for her wife. When the application was denied, she filed a complaint under the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s Employment Dispute Resolution Plan. Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, in his administrative capacity, ruled in 2009 that she was entitled to spousal health benefits, but the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced that it would not comply with the ruling.

On March 17, 2011, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White dismissed the suit on procedural grounds but invited Golinski to amend her suit to argue the unconstitutionality of DOMA Section 3, which she did on April 14. Following the Attorney General&#x27;s decision to no longer defend DOMA, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG), an arm of the House of Representatives, took up the defense. Former United States Solicitor General Paul Clement filed, on BLAG&#x27;s behalf, a motion to dismiss raising arguments previously avoided by the Department of Justice: that DOMA&#x27;s definition of marriage is valid &quot;because only a man and a woman can beget a child together, and because historical experience has shown that a family consisting of a married father and mother is an effective social structure for raising children.&quot; On July 1, 2011, the DOJ filed a brief in support of Golinski&#x27;s suit, in which it detailed for the first time its case for heightened scrutiny based on &quot;a significant history of purposeful discrimination against gay and lesbian people, by governmental as well as private entities&quot; and its arguments that DOMA Section 3 fails to meet that standard.

On February 22, 2012, White ruled for Golinski, finding DOMA &quot;violates her right to equal protection of the law under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.&quot; He wrote that Section 3 of DOMA could not pass the &quot;heightened scrutiny&quot; or the &quot;rational basis&quot; test. He wrote,

The Court finds that neither Congress&#x27; claimed legislative justifications nor any of the proposed reasons proffered by BLAG constitute bases rationally related to any of the alleged governmental interests. Further, after concluding that neither the law nor the record can sustain any of the interests suggested, the Court, having tried on its own, cannot conceive of any additional interests that DOMA might further.

While the case was on appeal to the Ninth Circuit, on July 3, 2012, the DOJ asked the Supreme Court to review the case before the Ninth Circuit decides it so it can be heard together with two other cases in which DOMA Section 3 was held unconstitutional, &quot;Gill v. Office of Personnel Management&quot; and &quot;Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human Services&quot;. The Supreme Court chose to hear &quot;Windsor&quot; instead of these cases, and following the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Windsor&quot; the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeal in &quot;Golinski&quot; with the consent of all parties on July 23.

===&quot;Gill&quot; and &quot;Massachusetts&quot;===
On March 3, 2009, GLAD filed a federal court challenge, &quot;Gill v. Office of Personnel Management&quot;, based on the Equal Protection Clause and the federal government&#x27;s consistent deference to each state&#x27;s definition of marriage prior to the enactment of DOMA. The case questioned only the DOMA provision that the federal government defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman. On May 6, 2010, Judge Joseph L. Tauro heard arguments in the U.S. District Court in Boston.

On July 8, 2009, Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley filed a suit, &quot;Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human Services&quot;, challenging the constitutionality of DOMA. The suit claims that Congress &quot;overstepped its authority, undermined states&#x27; efforts to recognize marriages between same-sex couples, and codified an animus towards gay and lesbian people.&quot; Tauro, the judge also handling &quot;Gill&quot;, heard arguments on May 26, 2010.

On July 8, 2010, Tauro issued his rulings in both &quot;Gill&quot; and &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, granting summary judgment for the plaintiffs in both cases. He found in &quot;Gill&quot; that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act violates the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In &quot;Massachusetts&quot; he held that the same section of DOMA violates the Tenth Amendment and falls outside Congress&#x27; authority under the Spending Clause of the Constitution. Those decisions were stayed after the DOJ filed an appeal on October 12, 2010.

On November 3, 2011, 133 House Democrats filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs in &quot;Gill&quot; and &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, asserting their belief that Section 3 of DOMA was unconstitutional. Included among the members of Congress signing the brief were 14 members who had voted for the bill in 1996. Seventy major employers also filed an amicus brief supporting the plaintiffs. A three-judge panel heard arguments in the case on April 4, 2012, during which the DOJ for the first time took the position that it could not defend Section 3 of DOMA under any level of scrutiny. On May 31, 2012, the panel unanimously affirmed Tauro&#x27;s ruling, finding Section 3 of DOMA unconstitutional. On June 29, BLAG filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court. The DOJ did so on July 3, while asking the Supreme Court to review &quot;Golinski&quot; as well. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts filed a response to both petitions adding the Spending Clause and Tenth Amendment issues as questions presented. The Supreme Court denied these petitions on June 27, 2013, following its decision in &quot;Windsor&quot;.

===&quot;United States v. Windsor&quot;===

On November 9, 2010, the American Civil Liberties Union filed &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; in New York on behalf of a surviving same-sex spouse whose inheritance from her deceased spouse had been subject to federal taxation as if they were unmarried. New York is part of the Second Circuit, where no precedent exists for the standard of review to be followed in sexual-orientation discrimination cases.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a brief supporting Windsor&#x27;s claim on July 26, 2011.

On June 6, 2012, Judge Barbara Jones ruled that based on rational basis review Section 3 of DOMA is unconstitutional and ordered the requested tax refund be paid to Windsor. The plaintiff commented, &quot;It&#x27;s thrilling to have a court finally recognize how unfair it is for the government to have treated us as though we were strangers.&quot; Windsor&#x27;s attorneys filed a petition of certiorari with the Supreme Court on July 16, asking for the case to be considered without waiting for the Second Circuit&#x27;s review. On October 18, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court&#x27;s ruling that Section 3 of DOMA is unconstitutional. According to an ACLU press release, this ruling was &quot;the first federal appeals court decision to decide that government discrimination against gay people gets a more exacting level of judicial review&quot;. In an opinion authored by Chief Judge Dennis Jacobs, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals stated:

Our straightforward legal analysis sidesteps the fair point that same-sex marriage is unknown to history and tradition, but law (federal or state) is not concerned with holy matrimony. Government deals with marriage as a civil status—however fundamental—and New York has elected to extend that status to same-sex couples.

On December 7, 2012, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Oral arguments were heard on March 27, 2013. In a 5–4 decision on June 26, 2013, the Court ruled Section 3 of DOMA to be unconstitutional, declaring it &quot;a deprivation of the liberty of the person protected by the Fifth Amendment.&quot;

On July 18, 2013, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG), which had mounted a defense of Section 3 when the administration declined to, acknowledged that in &quot;Windsor&quot; &quot;[t]he Supreme Court recently resolved the issue of DOMA Section 3&#x27;s constitutionality&quot; and said &quot;it no longer will defend that statute.&quot;

===&quot;Pedersen v. Office of Personnel Management&quot;===
&quot;Pedersen v. Office of Personnel Management&quot; is a case filed by GLAD in Connecticut on behalf of same-sex couples in Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire, in which GLAD repeats the arguments it made in &quot;Gill&quot;.

On July 31, 2012, Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant ruled that &quot;having considered the purported rational bases proffered by both BLAG and Congress and concluded that such objectives bear no rational relationship to Section 3 of DOMA as a legislative scheme, the Court finds that that no conceivable rational basis exists for the provision. The provision therefore violates the equal protection principles incorporated in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.&quot; She held that &quot;laws that classify people based on sexual orientation should be subject to heightened scrutiny by courts&quot; but determined Section 3 of DOMA &quot;fails to pass constitutional muster under even the most deferential level of judicial scrutiny.&quot; The case was appealed to the Second Circuit, and on August 21, 2012, Pedersen asked the Supreme Court to review the case before the Second Circuit decides it so it can be heard together with &quot;Gill v. Office of Personnel Management&quot; and &quot;Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human Services&quot;. The Supreme Court denied these petitions on June 27, 2013, following its decision in &quot;Windsor&quot;.

===Other cases===
Other cases that challenged DOMA include:
* &quot;Dragovich v. Department of the Treasury&quot;, No. 10-1564 (N.D. Cal.), a class action in which California same-sex couples seek equal access to California&#x27;s long-term care insurance program for public employees and their families. U.S. District Court Judge Claudia Wilken on May 24, 2012, found Section 3 of DOMA and certain IRS regulations violated the plaintiffs&#x27; equal protection rights.
* &quot;Hara v. Office of Personnel Management&quot;, No. 09-3134 (Fed. Cir.) Hara is one of the plaintiffs in &quot;Gill&quot;.
* &quot;Torres-Barragan v. Holder&quot;, No. 10-55768 (9th Cir.) An immigration-related DOMA challenge in which the district court rejected the constitutional challenges.
* &quot;Cozen O&#x27;Connor v. Tobits&quot;, No. 11-00045-CDJ, Pennsylvania, in which two parties dispute who inherits the proceeds of a law firm&#x27;s profit-sharing plan under ERISA and DOMA. The DOJ filed a brief arguing the unconstitutionality of DOMA. Following the decision in &quot;Windsor&quot;, Judge C. Darnell Jones II ruled that the widow qualified as the deceased&#x27;s spouse since Illinois, their state of domicile, recognized them as spouses in a civil union as defined by Illinois. The deceased&#x27;s parents dropped their appeal on August 30.
* On April 5, 2012, Chief Judge James Ware of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ordered the federal court clerk to reimburse Christopher Nathan, a court employee, for the costs of health insurance coverage for his same-sex spouse comparable to that denied him by Section 3 of DOMA. On November 21, 2012, the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference affirmed Ware&#x27;s decision and ordered the court to determine the amount due Nathan and pay him within 10 days.

==== Military and veterans cases ====
On October 13, 2011, Carmen Cardona, a U.S. Navy veteran, filed a lawsuit in the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims seeking disability benefits for her wife that the Veterans Administration and the Board of Veterans Appeals had denied. Cardona was represented by the Yale Law School Legal Services Clinic. At the request of BLAG, which defended the government&#x27;s action, and over Cardona&#x27;s objections, the court postponed oral argument in &quot;Cardona v. Shinseki&quot; pending the Supreme Court&#x27;s disposition of writs of certiorari in other DOMA cases.

On October 27, 2011, the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN) brought suit in federal court on behalf of several military servicemembers and veterans in same-sex marriages. In a November 21 filing in the case of &quot;McLaughlin v. Panetta&quot;, they wrote, &quot;Any claim that DOMA, as applied to military spousal benefits, survives rational basis review is strained because paying unequal benefits to service members runs directly counter to the military values of uniformity, fairness and unit cohesion.&quot; The benefits at issue include medical and dental benefits, basic housing and transportation allowances, family separation benefits, visitation rights in military hospitals, and survivor benefit plans. The case was assigned to Judge Richard G. Stearns. One of the plaintiffs in the case, lesbian Charlie Morgan, who was undergoing chemotherapy, met with an assistant to Boehner on February 9, 2012, to ask him to consider not defending DOMA. The case is on hold at the request of both sides in anticipation of the outcome of two other First Circuit cases on appeal, &quot;Gill v. Office of Personnel Management&quot; and &quot;Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human Services&quot;. On February 17, the DOJ announced it could not defend the constitutionality of the statutes challenged in the case. In May 2012, the parties filed briefs arguing whether BLAG has a right to intervene. On June 27, Stearns asked the parties to explain by July 18 why given the decision in &quot;Windsor&quot; he should not find for the plaintiffs. On July 18, BLAG&#x27;s response acknowledged that &quot;[t]he Supreme Court recently resolved the issue of DOMA Section 3&#x27;s constitutionality&quot; and asked to be allowed to withdraw from the case. It took no position on the two statutes at issue in the case, which define a &quot;spouse&quot; as &quot;a person of the opposite sex&quot;, except to say that &quot;the question of whether [that definition] is constitutional remains open&quot;.

Tracey Cooper-Harris, an Army veteran from California, sued the Veterans Administration and the DOJ in federal court on February 1, 2012, asking for her wife to receive the benefits normally granted to spouses of disabled veterans. BLAG sought a delay in &quot;Cooper-Harris v. United States&quot; pending the resolution of &quot;Golinski&quot;, which the attorneys for Cooper-Harris, the Southern Poverty Law Center, opposed. The court denied BLAG&#x27;s motion on August 4. In February 2013, Judge Consuelo Marshall rejected the DOJ&#x27;s argument that the case could only be heard by the Board of Veterans&#x27; Appeals and allowed the case to proceed. BLAG asked to withdraw from the lawsuit on July 22.

==== Bankruptcy court ====
In May 2011, DOMA-based challenges by the Department of Justice to joint petitions for bankruptcy by married same-sex couples were denied in two cases, one in the Southern District of New York on May 4 and one in the Eastern District of California on May 31. Both rulings stressed practical considerations and avoided ruling on DOMA.

On June 13, 2011, 20 of the 25 judges of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California signed an opinion in the case &quot;in re Balas and Morales&quot; that found that a same-sex married couple filing for bankruptcy &quot;have made their case persuasively that DOMA deprives them of the equal protection of the law to which they are entitled.&quot; The decision found DOMA Section 3 unconstitutional and dismissed BLAG&#x27;s objections to the joint filing:

Although individual members of Congress have every right to express their views and the views of their constituents with respect to their religious beliefs and principles and their personal standards of who may marry whom, this court cannot conclude that Congress is entitled to solemnize such views in the laws of this nation in disregard of the views, legal status and living arrangements of a significant segment of our citizenry that includes the Debtors in this case. To do so violates the Debtors&#x27; right to equal protection of those laws embodied in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. This court cannot conclude from the evidence or the record in this case that any valid governmental interest is advanced by DOMA as applied to the Debtors.

A spokesman for House Speaker Boehner said BLAG would not appeal the ruling, On July 7, 2011, the DOJ announced that after consultation with BLAG it would no longer raise objections to &quot;bankruptcy petitions filed jointly by same-sex couples who are married under state law&quot;.

==== Immigration cases ====
Bi-national same-sex couples were kept from legally living in the United States by DOMA&#x27;s Section 3, which prevented one spouse from sponsoring the other for a green card. Following some uncertainty after the Obama Administration determined Section 3 to be unconstitutional, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) reaffirmed its policy of denying such applications. With respect to obtaining a visitor&#x27;s visa, Bureau rules treated bi-national same-sex spouses the same as bi-national opposite-sex unmarried partners under the classification &quot;cohabiting partners&quot;.

Tim Coco and Genesio J. Oliveira, a same-sex couple married in Massachusetts in 2005, successfully challenged this policy and developed a model since followed by other immigration activists. The U.S. refused to recognize their marriage, and in 2007 Oliveira, a Brazilian national, accepted &quot;voluntary departure&quot; and returned to Brazil. They conducted a national press campaign A &quot;Boston Globe&quot; editorial commented, &quot;Great strides toward equality for gays have been made in this country, but the woeful fate of Tim Coco and Genesio Oliveira shows that thousands of same-sex couples, even in Massachusetts, still aren&#x27;t really full citizens.&quot; The editorial gained the attention of Senator John F. Kerry, who first lobbied Attorney General Eric Holder without success. He then gained the support of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who granted Oliveira humanitarian parole, enabling the couple to reunite in the U.S. in June 2010. Humanitarian parole is granted on a case-by-case basis at the Secretary&#x27;s discretion.

On September 28, 2011, in &quot;Lui v. Holder&quot;, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen V. Wilson rejected a challenge to DOMA, citing &quot;Adams v. Howerton&quot; (1982). The plaintiffs in that case had unsuccessfully challenged the denial of immediate relative status to the same-sex spouse of an American citizen. Early in 2012, two bi-national same-sex couples were granted &quot;deferred action&quot; status, suspending deportation proceedings against the non-U.S. citizen for a year. A similar Texas couple had a deportation case dismissed in March 2012, leaving the non-citizen spouse unable to work legally in the United States but no longer subject to the threat of deportation.

On January 5, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago decided the suit of a same-sex binational couple. Demos Revelis and Marcel Maas, married in Iowa in 2010, sought to prevent the USCIS from applying Section 3 of DOMA to Revelis&#x27;s application for a permanent residence visa for Maas and, in the court&#x27;s words, &quot;that their petition be reviewed and decided on the same basis as other married couples.&quot; Judge Harry D. Leinenweber, a Reagan appointee, denied the government&#x27;s motion to dismiss. BLAG has argued for the suit to be dismissed. In July the court stayed proceedings until mid-October because the USCIS was considering denying the plaintiffs&#x27; request on grounds unrelated to DOMA.

On April 2, 2012, five bi-national same-sex couples represented by Immigration Equality and Paul, Weiss filed a lawsuit, &quot;Blesch v. Holder&quot;, in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York, claiming that Section 3 of DOMA violated their equal protection rights by denying the U.S. citizen in the relationship the same rights in the green card application process granted a U.S. citizen who is in a relationship of partners of the opposite sex. On July 25, Chief Judge Carol Amon stayed the case pending the resolution of &quot;Windsor&quot; by the Second Circuit.

Immigration rights advocate Lavi Soloway reported on June 19, 2012, that the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) had in four cases responded to green card denials on the part of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) by asking the USCIS to document the marital status of the same-sex couples and determine whether the foreign national would qualify for a green card in the absence of DOMA Section 3. He said the BIA is &quot;essentially setting the stage for being able to approve the petitions in a post-DOMA universe.&quot;

On April 19, 2013, U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall ordered that a suit brought in July 2012 by Jane DeLeon, a Philippine citizen, and her spouse, Irma Rodriguez, a U.S. citizen, could proceed as a class action. The plaintiffs, represented by the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, contended that DeLeon was denied a residency waiver because of DOMA Section 3.

On June 28, 2013, the USCIS notified U.S. citizen Julian Marsh that it had approved the green card petition for his Bulgarian husband Traian Popov. Both are residents of Florida. On July 3, the USCIS office in Centennial, Colorado, granted Cathy Davis, a citizen of Ireland, a green card based on her marriage to U.S. citizen Catriona Dowling.

==== Tribunals ====
In 2009, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt declared DOMA unconstitutional in &quot;in re Levenson&quot;, an employment dispute resolution tribunal case, where the federal government refused to grant spousal benefits to Tony Sears, the husband of deputy federal public defender Brad Levenson. As an employee of the federal judiciary, Levenson is prohibited from suing his employer in federal court. Rather, employment disputes are handled at employment dispute resolution tribunals in which a federal judge hears the dispute in their capacity as a dispute resolution official.

==Challenges to Section 2 in federal court==
Section 2 of DOMA states to give legal relief to any state from recognizing same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions. Section 2 posits a conflict between states&#x27; rights and civil rights. Various federal lawsuits, some filed alongside challenges to Section 3, have challenged Section 2.
* &quot;In re Kandu&quot;: A same-sex couple in the state of Washington, who had married in Canada, attempted to file a joint bankruptcy petition, but were not allowed to do so.
* &quot;Wilson v. Ake&quot;, an unsuccessful attempt by a Florida same-sex couple, married in Massachusetts, to have their marriage license accepted in Florida.
* &quot;Smelt v. Orange County&quot; and &quot;Smelt v. United States&quot;: In February 2004, Arthur Smelt and Christopher Hammer sued Orange County, California, in federal court for refusing to issue them a marriage license. The district court ruled that the couple did not have standing to challenge Section 2 of DOMA and rejected their challenge to the constitutionality of Section 3. On May 5, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit dismissed the suit, and on October 10 the United States Supreme Court refused to consider the couple&#x27;s appeal. On March 9, 2009, the same couple, having legally married in California, filed &quot;Smelt v. United States&quot;, challenging the constitutionality of DOMA and California&#x27;s Proposition 8. District Judge David O. Carter dismissed the case on August 24, because the couple had not applied for and been denied any federal benefit and therefore lacked &quot;an injury in fact.&quot;
* &quot;Bishop v. United States&quot;: Two lesbian couples in Oklahoma, one of which couples sought a marriage license and the other to have the state recognize either their Canadian marriage or their Vermont civil union. The court stayed consideration of the case pending the outcome of &quot;Windsor&quot;. Later it ruled the couple challenging Section 2 did not have standing, but ruled Oklahoma&#x27;s same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional under &quot;Bishop v. Oklahoma&quot;.

===&quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;===
On June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; that the 14th Amendment requires all U.S. state laws to recognize same-sex marriages. This left Section 2 of DOMA as superseded and unenforceable.

==Repeal==

On September 15, 2009, three Democratic members of Congress, Jerrold Nadler of New York, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, and Jared Polis of Colorado, introduced legislation to repeal DOMA called the Respect for Marriage Act. The bill had 91 original co-sponsors in the House of Representatives and was supported by Clinton, Barr, and several legislators who voted for DOMA. Congressman Barney Frank and John Berry, head of the Office of Personnel Management, did not support that effort, stating that &quot;the backbone is not there&quot; in Congress. Frank and Berry suggested DOMA could be overturned more quickly through lawsuits such as &quot;Gill v. Office of Personnel Management&quot; filed by Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders (GLAD).

Following Holder&#x27;s announcement that the Obama Administration would no longer defend DOMA Section 3 in court, on March 16, 2011, Senator Dianne Feinstein introduced the Respect for Marriage Act in the Senate again and Nadler introduced it in the House. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 10–8 in favor of advancing the bill to the Senate floor, but observers believed it would not gain the 60 votes needed to end debate and bring it to a vote.

After the Supreme Court struck down DOMA Section 3 on June 26, 2013, Feinstein and Nadler reintroduced the Respect for Marriage Act as and . The Respect for Marriage Act cleared the 60 vote filibuster hurdle on November 16, 2022, when the Senate voted 62–37 to advance it. Joe Biden signed the repeal on December 13, 2022.

<text>Rendsburg-Eckernförde (; ) is a district in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the city of Kiel, the district of Plön, the city of Neumünster, the districts of Segeberg, Steinburg, Dithmarschen and Schleswig-Flensburg, and the Baltic Sea.

==History==

In 1867 the Prussian administration established twenty districts in its province of Schleswig-Holstein, among them the districts of Rendsburg and Eckernförde. The present district was established in 1970 by merging the former districts.

==Geography==

The district is situated at the coast of the Baltic Sea, roughly between the cities of Schleswig and Kiel. A large portion of the Kiel Canal passes through Rendsburg-Eckernförde. It is one of the largest districts in the whole of Germany.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* two lions (blue on yellow) from the arms of the Duchy of Schleswig
* a nettle leaf (white on red) from the arms of Holstein

==Towns and municipalities==

<text>Luli or Elulaios was king of the Phoenician city of Tyre (729–694 BC). During his reign, Tyre lost what remained of its power to Assyria.

The reign of Luli is characterized by several wars with Assyria. Tyre was tributary to Assyria, but Luli revolted against the Assyrians more than once. From 724 to 720 BC, Tyre was under siege, the port being blockaded by Shalmaneser. During the reign of Sargon, the Assyrians had occupied Cyprus, but following Sargon&#x27;s death in 705, Luli reclaimed the island and its colony of Kition. In 701, after another revolt, Sennacherib forced Luli to flee to Kition. Tyre lost control over Sidon and Akko, being reduced to the city itself and its overseas colonies. After Luli&#x27;s death, the kingdom of Tyre was ruled by a series of pro-Assyrian monarchs and governors.

<doc id="92962" wikidata="Q72000" url="?curid=92962" title="Lemierre's syndrome">
<text>Lemierre&#x27;s syndrome is infectious thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein. It most often develops as a complication of a bacterial sore throat infection in young, otherwise healthy adults. The thrombophlebitis is a serious condition and may lead to further systemic complications such as bacteria in the blood or septic emboli.

Lemierre&#x27;s syndrome occurs most often when a bacterial (e.g., &quot;Fusobacterium necrophorum&quot;) throat infection progresses to the formation of a peritonsillar abscess. Deep in the abscess, anaerobic bacteria can flourish. When the abscess wall ruptures internally, the drainage carrying bacteria seeps through the soft tissue and infects the nearby structures. Spread of infection to the nearby internal jugular vein provides a gateway for the spread of bacteria through the bloodstream. The inflammation surrounding the vein and compression of the vein may lead to blood clot formation. Pieces of the potentially infected clot can break off and travel through the right heart into the lungs as emboli, blocking branches of the pulmonary artery that carry deoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs.
Sepsis following a throat infection was first described by Hugo Schottmüller in 1918. In 1936, André Lemierre published a series of 20 cases where throat infections were followed by identified anaerobic sepsis, of whom 18 died.

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of Lemierre&#x27;s syndrome vary, but usually start with a sore throat, fever, and general body weakness. These are followed by extreme lethargy, spiked fevers, rigors, swollen cervical lymph nodes, and a swollen, tender or painful neck. Often there is abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting during this phase. These signs and symptoms usually occur several days to two weeks after the initial symptoms.
Symptoms of pulmonary involvement can be shortness of breath, cough and painful breathing (pleuritic chest pain). Rarely, blood is coughed up. Painful or inflamed joints can occur when the joints are involved.

Septic shock can also arise. This presents with low blood pressure, increased heart rate, decreased urine output and an increased rate of breathing. Some cases will also present with meningitis, which will typically manifest as neck stiffness, headache and sensitivity of the eyes to light. Liver enlargement and spleen enlargement can be found, but are not always associated with liver or spleen abscesses. Other signs and symptoms that may occur:
* Headache (unrelated to meningitis)
* Memory loss
* Muscle pain
* Jaundice
* Decreased ability to open the jaw
* Crepitations are sometimes heard over the lungs
* Pericardial friction rubs as a sign of pericarditis (rare)
* Cranial nerve paralysis and Horner&#x27;s syndrome (both rare)

==Cause==
The bacteria causing the thrombophlebitis are anaerobic bacteria that are typically normal components of the microorganisms that inhabit the mouth and throat. Species of &quot;Fusobacterium&quot;, specifically &quot;Fusobacterium necrophorum&quot;, are most commonly the causative bacteria, but various bacteria have been implicated. One 1989 study found that 81% of Lemierres&#x27;s syndrome had been infected with &quot;Fusobacterium necrophorum&quot;, while 11% were caused by other Fusobacterium species. MRSA might also be an issue in Lemierre infections. Rarely Lemierre&#x27;s syndrome is caused by other (usually Gram-negative) bacteria, which include &quot;Bacteroides fragilis&quot; and &quot;Bacteroides melaninogenicus&quot;, &quot;Peptostreptococcus spp.&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus microaerophile&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, and &quot;Eikenella corrodens&quot;.

==Pathophysiology==
Lemierre&#x27;s syndrome begins with an infection of the head and neck region, with most primary sources of infection in the palatine tonsils and peritonsillar tissue. Usually this infection is a pharyngitis (which occurred in 87.1% of patients as reported by a literature review), and can be preceded by infectious mononucleosis as reported in several cases. It can also be initiated by infections of the ear, mastoid bone, sinuses, or saliva glands.

During the primary infection, &quot;F. necrophorum&quot; colonizes the infection site and the infection spreads to the parapharyngeal space. The bacteria then invade the peritonsillar blood vessels where they can spread to the internal jugular vein. In this vein, the bacteria cause the formation of a thrombus containing these bacteria. Furthermore, the internal jugular vein becomes inflamed. This septic thrombophlebitis can give rise to septic microemboli that disseminate to other parts of the body where they can form abscesses and septic infarctions. The first capillaries that the emboli encounter where they can nestle themselves are the pulmonary capillaries. As a consequence, the most frequently involved site of septic metastases are the lungs, followed by the joints (knee, hip, sternoclavicular joint, shoulder and elbow). In the lungs, the bacteria cause abscesses, nodulary and cavitary lesions. Pleural effusion is often present. Other sites involved in septic metastasis and abscess formation are the muscles and soft tissues, liver, spleen, kidneys and nervous system (intracranial abscesses, meningitis).

Production of bacterial toxins such as lipopolysaccharide leads to secretion of cytokines by white blood cells which then both lead to symptoms of sepsis. &quot;F. necrophorum&quot; produces hemagglutinin which causes platelet aggregation that can lead to diffuse intravascular coagulation and thrombocytopenia.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis and the imaging (and laboratory) studies to be ordered largely depend on the patient history, signs and symptoms. If a persistent sore throat with signs of sepsis are found, physicians are cautioned to screen for Lemierre&#x27;s syndrome.

Laboratory investigations reveal signs of a bacterial infection with elevated C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and white blood cells (notably neutrophils). Platelet count can be low or high. Liver and kidney function tests are often abnormal.

Thrombosis of the internal jugular vein can be displayed with sonography. Thrombi that have developed recently have low echogenicity or echogenicity similar to the flowing blood, and in such cases pressure with the ultrasound probe show a non-compressible jugular vein - a sure sign of thrombosis. Also color or power Doppler ultrasound identify a low echogenicity blood clot. A CT scan or an MRI scan is more sensitive in displaying the thrombus of the intra-thoracic retrosternal veins, but are rarely needed.

Chest X-ray and chest CT may show pleural effusion, nodules, infiltrates, abscesses and cavitations.

Bacterial cultures taken from the blood, joint aspirates or other sites can identify the causative agent of the disease.

Other illnesses that can be included in the differential diagnosis are:
* Q fever
* Tuberculosis
* Pneumonia

==Treatment==
Lemierre&#x27;s syndrome is primarily treated with antibiotics given intravenously. &quot;Fusobacterium necrophorum&quot; is generally highly susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, metronidazole, clindamycin and third generation cephalosporins while the other fusobacteria have varying degrees of resistance to beta-lactams and clindamycin. Additionally, there may exist a co-infection by another bacterium. For these reasons is often advised not to use monotherapy in treating Lemierre&#x27;s syndrome. Penicillin and penicillin-derived antibiotics can thus be combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor such as clavulanic acid or with metronidazole. Clindamycin can be given as monotherapy.

If antibiotic therapy is unsuccessful, additional treatments include draining of any abscesses and ligation of the internal jugular vein where the antibiotic cannot penetrate.
There is no evidence to opt for or against the use of anticoagulation therapy. The low incidence of Lemierre&#x27;s syndrome has not made it possible to set up clinical trials to study the disease.

==Prognosis==
The mortality rate was 90% prior to antibiotic therapy. In the contemporary era, a mortality of 4% has been estimated. Since this disease is not well known and often remains undiagnosed, mortality might be much higher. Approximately 10% of those with the condition experience clinical sequelae, including cranial nerve palsy and orthopaedic limitations.

==Epidemiology==
Lemierre&#x27;s syndrome is currently rare, but was more common in the early 20th century before the discovery of penicillin. The reduced use of antibiotics for sore throats may have increased the risk of this disease, with 19 cases in 1997 and 34 cases in 1999 reported in the UK. The estimated incidence rate is 0.8 to 3.6 cases per million in the general population, but is higher in healthy young adults. The number of cases reported is increasing; however, because of its rarity, physicians may be unaware of its existence, possibly leading to underdiagnosis.

==History==
Sepsis following from a throat infection was described by Hugo Schottmüller in 1918. In 1936, André Lemierre published a series of 20 cases where throat infections were followed by identified anaerobic sepsis, of whom 18 patients died.

<text>Rendsburg (, also &quot;Rensborg&quot;, , also &quot;Rensborg&quot;) is a town on the River Eider and the Kiel Canal in the central part of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is the capital of the &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) of Rendsburg-Eckernförde. , it had a population of 28,476.

==History==
Rendsburg&#x27;s foundation date is unknown though some form of fortifications was established by Bjørn Svendsen 1099–1100. Rendsburg was first mentioned in 1199. An old form of its name was Reinoldesburch.

It became a part of Holstein in the 13th century, but was transferred to Schleswig in 1460. Many times the town passed from Danish to German control and vice versa. In the German-Danish War in 1864 Rendsburg was finally seized by Kingdom of Prussia and Austria. After 1866 the town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. Since that time it has remained part of Germany.

Although the Eider is navigable for small craft from its mouth on the North Sea to Rendsburg, the town&#x27;s importance rose in 1895, when the Kiel Canal was finished. The much larger ships that could navigate the Kiel Canal meant that, although situated inland, Rendsburg became a seaport and a dockyard.

==Sights==
The most prominent structure in town, the Rendsburg High Bridge, 
a railway bridge made of steel, in length and in height, was constructed in 1913 to take the Neumünster–Flensburg railway over the Kiel Canal from the relatively flat land on either side. It is the longest railway bridge in Europe (highway/rail bridge Øresund Bridge is longer): on the northern side, the bridge connects to the Rendsburg Loop to gain height and to allow trains to continue to serve the Rendsburg station. Suspended from the railway bridge, a transporter bridge – one of only twenty ever built – traverses the canal.

The German Army&#x27;s Air Defence School and the Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz are both located in Rendsburg.

<doc id="92972" wikidata="Q161227" url="?curid=92972" title="Yalta Conference">
<text>The Yalta Conference (), held 4–11 February 1945, was the World War II meeting of the heads of government of the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union to discuss the postwar reorganization of Germany and Europe. The three states were represented by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and General Secretary Joseph Stalin. The conference was held near Yalta in Crimea, Soviet Union, within the Livadia, Yusupov, and Vorontsov palaces.

The aim of the conference was to shape a postwar peace that represented not only a collective security order, but also a plan to give self-determination to the liberated peoples of Europe. Intended mainly to discuss the re-establishment of the nations of war-torn Europe, within a few years, with the Cold War dividing the continent, the conference became a subject of intense controversy.

Yalta was the second of three major wartime conferences among the Big Three. It was preceded by the Tehran Conference in November 1943 and was followed by the Potsdam Conference in July of the same year, 1945. It was also preceded by a conference in Moscow in October 1944, not attended by Roosevelt, in which Churchill and Stalin had spoken about Western and Soviet spheres of influence in Europe.

== Conference ==
During the Yalta Conference, the Western Allies had liberated all of France and Belgium and were fighting on the western border of Germany. In the east, Soviet forces were from Berlin, having already pushed back the Germans from Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria. There was no longer a question regarding German defeat. The issue was the new shape of postwar Europe.

The French leader General Charles de Gaulle was not invited to either the Yalta or Potsdam Conferences, a diplomatic slight that was the occasion for deep and lasting resentment. De Gaulle attributed his exclusion from Yalta to the longstanding personal antagonism towards him by Roosevelt, but the Soviets had also objected to his inclusion as a full participant. However, the absence of French representation at Yalta also meant that extending an invitation for de Gaulle to attend the Potsdam Conference would have been highly problematic since he would have felt honor-bound to insist that all issues agreed at Yalta in his absence be reopened.

The initiative for calling a second &quot;Big Three&quot; conference had come from Roosevelt, who hoped for a meeting before the US presidential elections in November 1944 but pressed for a meeting early in 1945 at a neutral location in the Mediterranean. Malta, Cyprus, Sicily, Athens, and Jerusalem were all suggested. Stalin, insisting that his doctors opposed any long trips, rejected those options. He proposed instead for them meet at the Black Sea resort of Yalta in the Crimea. Stalin&#x27;s fear of flying also was a contributing factor in the decision.

Each of the three leaders had his own agenda for postwar Germany and liberated Europe. Roosevelt wanted Soviet support in the Pacific War against Japan, specifically for the planned invasion of Japan (Operation August Storm), as well as Soviet participation in the United Nations. Churchill pressed for free elections and democratic governments in Central and Eastern Europe, specifically Poland. Stalin demanded a Soviet sphere of political influence in Eastern and Central Europe as an essential aspect of the Soviets&#x27; national security strategy, and his position at the conference was felt by him to be so strong that he could dictate terms. According to US delegation member and future Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, &quot;it was not a question of what we would let the Russians do, but what we could get the Russians to do&quot;.

Poland was the first item on the Soviet agenda. Stalin stated, &quot;For the Soviet government, the question of Poland was one of honor&quot; and security because Poland had served as a historical corridor for forces attempting to invade Russia. In addition, Stalin stated regarding history that &quot;because the Russians had greatly sinned against Poland&quot;, &quot;the Soviet government was trying to atone for those sins&quot;. Stalin concluded that &quot;Poland must be strong&quot; and that &quot;the Soviet Union is interested in the creation of a mighty, free and independent Poland&quot;. Accordingly, Stalin stipulated that Polish government-in-exile demands were not negotiable, and the Soviets would keep the territory of eastern Poland that they had annexed in 1939, with Poland to be compensated for that by extending its western borders at the expense of Germany.

Roosevelt wanted the Soviets to enter the Pacific War against Japan with the Allies, which he hoped would end the war sooner and reduce American casualties. 

One Soviet precondition for a declaration of war against Japan was an American official recognition of the Mongolian independence from China (the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic had been a Soviet satellite state from 1924 to World War II). The Soviets also wanted the recognition of Soviet interests in the Chinese Eastern Railway and Port Arthur but not asking the Chinese to lease.

The Soviets wanted the return of South Sakhalin, which had been taken from Russia by Japan in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, and the cession of Kuril Islands by Japan, both of which were approved by the other Allies. In return, Stalin pledged that the Soviet Union would enter the Pacific War three months after the defeat of Germany. 

The fate of Korea is not mentioned on the records of demands and concessions at Yalta. However, several declassified documents later revealed that on 8 February, while Churchill was not present, Roosevelt and Stalin secretly discussed the peninsula. Roosevelt brought up the idea of putting Korea into a trusteeship divided among the Soviets, the Americans, and the Chinese for a period of 20 to 30 years. He expressed reluctance to invite the British to the trusteeship, but Stalin reportedly replied that the British &quot;would most certainly be offended. In fact, the Prime Minister might &#x27;kill us. Roosevelt agreed with the assessment. Stalin suggested the trusteeship be as short as possible. The two quickly agreed that their troops should not be stationed in Korea. Korea was not discussed again throughout the conference.
Furthermore, the Soviets agreed to join the United Nations because of a secret understanding of a voting formula with a veto power for permanent members of the Security Council, which ensured that each country could block unwanted decisions.

The Soviet Army had occupied Poland completely and held much of Eastern Europe with a military power three times greater than Allied forces in the West. The Declaration of Liberated Europe did little to dispel the sphere of influence agreements, which had been incorporated into armistice agreements.

All three leaders ratified the agreement of the European Advisory Commission setting the boundaries of postwar occupation zones for Germany with three zones of occupation, one for each of the three principal Allies. They also agreed to give France a zone of occupation carved out of the US and UK zones, but De Gaulle maintained the principle of refusing to accept that the French zone would be defined by boundaries established in his absence. He thus ordered French forces to occupy Stuttgart in addition to the lands earlier agreed upon as comprising the French occupation zone. He only withdrew when threatened with the suspension of essential American economic supplies. Churchill at Yalta then argued that the French also needed to be a full member of the proposed Allied Control Council for Germany. Stalin resisted that until Roosevelt backed Churchill&#x27;s position, but Stalin still remained adamant that the French should not be admitted to full membership of the Allied Reparations Commission to be established in Moscow and relented only at the Potsdam Conference.

Also, the Big Three agreed that all original governments would be restored to the invaded countries, with the exceptions of Romania and Bulgaria, and Poland, whose government-in-exile was also excluded by Stalin, and that all of their civilians would be repatriated.

=== Declaration of Liberated Europe ===

The Declaration of Liberated Europe was created by Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Joseph Stalin during the Yalta Conference. It was a promise that allowed the people of Europe &quot;to create democratic institutions of their own choice&quot;. The declaration pledged that &quot;the earliest possible establishment through free elections governments responsive to the will of the people&quot;. That is similar to the statements of the Atlantic Charter for &quot;the right of all people to choose the form of government under which they will live&quot;.

===Key points===

The key points of the meeting were as follows:

* Agreement to the priority of the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany. After the war, Germany and Berlin would be split into four occupied zones.
* Stalin agreed that France would have a fourth occupation zone in Germany if it was formed from the American and the British zones.
* Germany would undergo demilitarization and denazification. At the Yalta Conference, the Allies decided to provide safeguards against a potential military revival of Germany, to eradicate German militarism and the Nazi general staff, to bring about the denazification of Germany, to punish the war criminals and to disarm and demilitarise Germany.
* German war reparations were partly to be in the form of forced labor. The forced labour was to be used to repair damage that Germany had inflicted on its victims. However, laborers were also forced to harvest crops, mine uranium, and do other work (see also &quot;Forced labor of Germans after World War II&quot; and &quot;Forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union&quot;).
* Creation of a reparation council which would be located in the Soviet Union.
* The status of Poland was discussed. The recognition of the communist Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland, which had been installed by the Soviet Union &quot;on a broader democratic basis&quot;, was agreed to.
* The Polish eastern border would follow the Curzon Line, and Poland would receive territorial compensation in the west from Germany.
* Stalin pledged to permit free elections in Poland.
* Roosevelt obtained a commitment by Stalin to participate in the United Nations.
* Stalin requested that all of the 16 Soviet Socialist Republics would be granted UN membership. That was taken into consideration, but 14 republics were denied; Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to membership for Ukraine and Byelorussia. While Roosevelt requested additional votes, with Churchill agreeing in principle and Stalin suggesting two addition votes so as to be equal to the Soviet Union, the United States ultimately did not request more than one vote.
* Stalin agreed to enter the fight against the Empire of Japan &quot;in two or three months after Germany has surrendered and the war in Europe is terminated&quot;. As a result, the Soviets would take possession of Southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, the port of Dalian would be internationalized, and the Soviet lease of Port Arthur would be restored, among other concessions.
* For the bombing of Japan, agreement was reached on basing U.S. Army Air Force B-29s near the mouth of the Amur River in the Komsomolsk-Nikolaevsk area (not near Vladivostok, as had earlier been proposed), but that did not eventuate. General Aleksei Antonov also said that the Red Army would take the southern half of Sakhalin Island as one of its first objectives and that American assistance to defend Kamchatka would be desirable.
* Nazi war criminals were to be found and put on trial in the territories in which their crimes had been committed. Nazi leaders were to be executed.
* A &quot;Committee on Dismemberment of Germany&quot; was to be set up. Its purpose was to decide whether Germany was to be divided into several nations. Some examples of partition plans are shown below:

===Democratic elections===
The Big Three further agreed that democracies would be established, all liberated European and former Axis satellite countries would hold free elections and that order would be restored. In that regard, they promised to rebuild occupied countries by processes that will allow them &quot;to create democratic institutions of their own choice. This is a principle of the Atlantic Charter – the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live.&quot; The resulting report stated that the three would assist occupied countries to form interim government that &quot;pledged to the earliest possible establishment through free elections of the Governments responsive to the will of the people&quot; and to &quot;facilitate where necessary the holding of such elections&quot;.

The agreement called on signatories to &quot;consult together on the measures necessary to discharge the joint responsibilities set forth in this declaration&quot;. During the Yalta discussions, Molotov inserted language that weakened the implication of enforcement of the declaration.

Regarding Poland, the Yalta report further stated that the provisional government should &quot;be pledged to the holding of free and unfettered elections as soon as possible on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot&quot;. The agreement could not conceal the importance of acceding to the pro-Soviet short-term Lublin government control and of eliminating language that called for supervised elections.

According to Roosevelt, &quot;if we attempt to evade the fact that we placed somewhat more emphasis on the Lublin Poles than on the other two groups from which the new government is to be drawn I feel we will expose ourselves to the charges that we are attempting to go back on the Crimea decision&quot;. Roosevelt conceded that, in the words of Admiral William D. Leahy, the language of Yalta was so vague that the Soviets could &quot;stretch it all the way from Yalta to Washington without ever technically breaking it&quot;.

The final agreement stipulated that &quot;the Provisional Government which is now functioning in Poland should therefore be reorganized on a broader democratic basis with the inclusion of democratic leaders from Poland and from Poles abroad&quot;. The language of Yalta conceded predominance of the pro-Soviet Lublin government in a provisional government but a reorganized one.

==Aftermath==
===Eastern Bloc===


Because of Stalin&#x27;s promises, Churchill believed that he would keep his word regarding Poland and he remarked, &quot;Poor Neville Chamberlain believed he could trust Hitler. He was wrong. But I don&#x27;t think I am wrong about Stalin.&quot;

Churchill defended his actions at Yalta in a three-day parliamentary debate starting on February 27, which ended in a vote of confidence. During the debate, many MPs criticised Churchill and expressed deep reservations about Yalta and support for Poland, with 25 drafting an amendment protesting the agreement.

After the Second World War ended, a communist government was installed in Poland. Many Poles felt betrayed by their wartime allies. Many Polish soldiers refused to return to Poland because of the Soviet repressions of Polish citizens (1939–1946), the Trial of the Sixteen and other executions of pro-Western Poles, particularly the former members of the AK (Armia Krajowa). The result was the Polish Resettlement Act 1947, Britain&#x27;s first mass immigration law.

On March 1, 1945, Roosevelt assured Congress, &quot;I come from the Crimea with a firm belief that we have made a start on the road to a world of peace&quot;. However, the Western Powers soon realized that Stalin would not honour his promise of free elections for Poland. After receiving considerable criticism in London following Yalta regarding the atrocities committed in Poland by Soviet troops, Churchill wrote Roosevelt a desperate letter referencing the wholesale deportations and liquidations of opposition Poles by the Soviets. On March 11, Roosevelt responded to Churchill: &quot;I most certainly agree that we must stand firm on a correct interpretation of the Crimean decision. You are quite correct in assuming that neither the Government nor the people of this country will support participation in a fraud or a mere whitewash of the Lublin government and the solution must be as we envisaged it in Yalta.&quot;

By March 21, Roosevelt&#x27;s Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Averell Harriman, cabled Roosevelt that &quot;we must come clearly to realize that the Soviet program is the establishment of totalitarianism, ending personal liberty and democracy as we know it&quot;. Two days later, Roosevelt began to admit that his view of Stalin had been excessively optimistic and that &quot;Averell is right.&quot;

Four days later, on March 27, the Soviet People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) arrested 16 Polish opposition political leaders who had been invited to participate in provisional government negotiations. The arrests were part of a trick employed by the NKVD, which flew the leaders to Moscow for a later show trial, followed by sentencing to a gulag. Churchill thereafter argued to Roosevelt that it was &quot;as plain as a pike staff&quot; that Moscow&#x27;s tactics were to drag out the period for holding free elections &quot;while the Lublin Committee consolidate their power&quot;. The Polish elections, held on January 16, 1947, resulted in Poland&#x27;s official transformation to a communist state by 1949.

Following Yalta, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov expressed worry that the Yalta Agreement&#x27;s wording might impede Stalin&#x27;s plans, Stalin responded, &quot;Never mind. We&#x27;ll do it our own way later.&quot; The Soviet Union had already annexed several occupied countries as (or into) Soviet Socialist Republics, and other countries in Central and Eastern Europe were occupied and converted into Soviet-controlled satellite states, such as the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, the People&#x27;s Republic of Hungary, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, the People&#x27;s Republic of Romania, the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria, the People&#x27;s Republic of Albania, and later East Germany from the Soviet zone of German occupation. Eventually, the United States and the United Kingdom made concessions in recognizing the communist-dominated regions by sacrificing the substance of the Yalta Declaration although it remained in form.

====Aborted enforcement plans====

At some point in the spring of 1945, Churchill had commissioned a contingency military enforcement operation plan for war on the Soviet Union to obtain &quot;square deal for Poland&quot; (Operation Unthinkable), which resulted in a May 22 report that stated unfavorable success odds. The report&#x27;s arguments included geostrategic issues (a possible Soviet-Japanese alliance resulting in moving of Japanese troops from the Asian Continent to Home Islands, threat to Iran and Iraq) and uncertainties concerning land battles in Europe.

===Potsdam Conference===

The Potsdam Conference was held from July to August 1945, which included the participation of Clement Attlee, who had replaced Churchill as prime minister and President Harry S Truman (representing the United States after Roosevelt&#x27;s death). At Potsdam, the Soviets denied claims that they were interfering in the affairs of Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary. The conference resulted in the Potsdam Declaration, regarding the surrender of Japan, and the Potsdam Agreement, regarding the Soviet annexation of former Polish territory east of the Curzon Line, provisions to be addressed in an eventual Final Treaty ending World War II, and the annexation of parts of Germany east of the Oder-Neisse line into Poland and of northern East Prussia into the Soviet Union.

===American politics===
Roosevelt&#x27;s generous terms to Stalin, followed quite quickly by the start of the Cold War under Roosevelt&#x27;s Vice President and successor, Harry Truman meant that Yalta was often seen in a bad light in American public opinion, particularly among most shades of Republicans and more Conservative Democrats in the South and West as well as by many ethnic Americans with links to Eastern Europe. When Eisenhower was elected as President on the Republican ticket there were hopes that Yalta would be repudiated by the new Administration and the newly Republican Senate. Efforts were made by both the new Senate Majority Leader, Robert A. Taft, and Republican members of the Foreign Relations Committee, although this fizzled out after Stalin&#x27;s death.

<text>The uilleann pipes ( , ), also known as Union pipes and sometimes called Irish pipes, are the characteristic national bagpipe of Ireland. Their current name is a partial translation of the Irish language terms (literally, &quot;pipes of the elbow&quot;), from their method of inflation. There is no historical record of the name or use of the term &quot;uilleann pipes&quot; before the 20th century. It was an invention of Grattan Flood and the name stuck. People mistook the term &#x27;union&#x27; to refer to the 1800 Act of Union; however, this is incorrect as Breandán Breathnach points out that a poem published in 1796 uses the term &#x27;union&#x27;.

The bag of the uilleann pipes is inflated by means of a small set of bellows strapped around the waist and the right arm (in the case of a right-handed player; in the case of a left-handed player the location and orientation of all components are reversed). The bellows not only relieve the player from the effort needed to blow into a bag to maintain pressure, they also allow relatively dry air to power the reeds, reducing the adverse effects of moisture on tuning and longevity. Some pipers can converse or sing while playing. The bag which the bellows fill is clamped under the other elbow, which squeezes the bag to control the flow of air to the reeds (which make the notes).

The air goes from the bag to the chanter, drones, and regulators. The chanter is played with the fingers like a flute. The chanter has a range of two full octaves, including sharps and flats (because, unlike most bagpipe chanters, it can be overblown to produce the higher octave). The chanter is often played resting on the piper&#x27;s thigh, closing off the bottom hole, so that air can only escape through the open tone holes. If one tone hole is closed before the next one is opened, a staccato effect can be created, because the sound stops completely when no air can escape at all. The three drones are simple open pipes; they constantly play three notes spread an octave apart. The three regulators are closed pipes. Untouched, they do not sound, but they have keys that can be opened by the piper&#x27;s wrist action (or hand, if they take one hand off the chanter). Each regulator key sounds a different note when opened. The regulator keys are aligned so that several may be pressed simultaneously. These enable the piper to play simple chords, giving rhythmic and harmonic accompaniment as needed. There are also many &quot;ornaments&quot; based on multiple or single grace notes.

The tone of the uilleann pipes is unlike that of many other forms of bagpipes. They have a different harmonic structure, sounding sweeter and quieter than many other bagpipes, such as the Great Irish warpipes, Great Highland bagpipes or the Italian zampognas. The uilleann pipes are often played indoors, and are almost always played sitting down.

==Etymology==
 is a genitive form of the Irish word for &quot;elbow”, . The Irish term for uilleann pipes is (alt. ), which means &quot;pipes(s) of the elbow(s)”.

However, the first attested written form is &quot;Union pipes&quot;, at the end of the 18th century, perhaps to denote the union of the chanter, drones, and regulators. Another theory is that it was played throughout a prototypical full union of England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland. This is definitely untrue, because this name for the instrument predates the Act of Union, which took effect in 1801. Alternatively, the uilleann pipes were certainly a favourite of the upper classes in Scotland, Ireland and the North-East of England and were fashionable for a time in formal social settings, where the term Union pipes may also originate.

The term &quot;uilleann pipes&quot; is first attested at the beginning of the 20th century. William Henry Grattan Flood, an Irish music scholar, proposed the theory that the name &quot;uilleann&quot; came from the Irish word for &quot;elbow&quot;. He cited to this effect William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; published in 1600 (Act IV, sc. I, l. 55) where the expression &quot;woollen pipes&quot; appears. This theory originated in correspondence between two earlier antiquarians, and was adopted as gospel by the Gaelic League. The use of &quot;uilleann&quot; was perhaps also a rebellion against the term &quot;union&quot;, with its connotations of the Act of Union. It was however shown by Breandán Breathnach that it would be difficult to explain the anglicization of the word &quot;uilleann&quot; into &#x27;woollen&#x27; before the 16th century (when the instrument did not exist as such) and then its adaptation as &#x27;union&#x27; two centuries later.

==History==
The first bagpipes to be well attested for Ireland were similar, if not identical, to the Scottish Highland bagpipes that are now played in Scotland. These are known as the &quot;Great Irish Warpipes&quot;. In Irish and Scottish Gaelic, this instrument was called the (&quot;great pipe&quot;).

While the mouth-blown warpipe was alive and well upon the battlefields of France and other parts of Europe, it had almost disappeared in Ireland. The union or &quot;uilleann&quot; pipe emerged during the early 18th century around the same time as the development of the bellows-driven Northumbrian smallpipes and the bellows-driven Scottish Lowland bagpipes. All three instruments were far quieter and sweeter in tone than their mouth-blown predecessors. Essentially their design required the joining of a bellows under the right arm, which pumped air via a tube to a leather bag under the left arm, which in turn supplied air at a constant pressure to the chanter and the drones (and regulators in the case of the Irish Uilleann pipes). Geoghegan&#x27;s tutor of the 1740s calls this early form of the uilleann pipes the &quot;Pastoral or New bagpipe&quot;. The Pastoral pipes were bellows blown and played in either a seated or standing position. The conical bored chanter was played &quot;open&quot;, that is, legato, unlike the uilleann pipes, which can also be played &quot;closed&quot;, that is, staccato. The early Pastoral pipes had two drones, and later examples had one (or rarely, two) regulator(s). The Pastoral and later flat set Union pipes developed with ideas on the instrument being traded back-and-forth between Ireland, Scotland and England, around the 18th and early 19th centuries.

The earliest surviving sets of uilleann pipes date from the second half of the 18th century, but it must be said that datings are not definitive. Only recently has scientific attention begun to be paid to the instrument, and problems relating to various stages of its development have yet to be resolved. The Uilleann pipes or union pipes might have originated from the Pastoral pipes (Border pipes, Northumbrian pipes, Scottish smallpipes) and gained popularity in Ireland within the Protestant Anglo-Irish community and its gentlemen pipers, who could afford such expensive hand-made instruments. The Irish uilleann pipes are far more elaborate in their design, and their development is likely to have occurred among the well-to-do. Certainly many of the early players in Ireland were Protestant, possibly the best known being the mid-18th-century piper Jackson from Co Limerick and the 18th-century Tandragee blind pipemaker William Kennedy. The famous Rowsome family from Co. Wexford were also Church of Ireland until the mid-late 19th century. The Uilleann pipes were often used by the Protestant clergy, who employed them as an alternative to the church organ. As late as the 19th century the instrument was still commonly associated with the Anglo-Irish, e.g. the Anglican clergyman Canon James Goodman (1828–1896) from Kerry, who had his tailor-made uilleann pipes buried with him at Creagh (Church of Ireland) cemetery near Baltimore, County Cork. His friend, and Trinity College colleague, John Hingston from Skibbereen also played the uilleann pipes. Another piping friend of Canon Goodman, Alderman Phair of Cork (founder of the pipers club in Cork in the 1890s) had Goodman&#x27;s pipes recovered from Creagh cemetery. They were later donated to Cork piper Michael O&#x27;Riabhaigh, who had re-established the (by then extinct) pipers club in Cork in the 1960s.

==Tuning==
The instrument is most usually (nowadays) tuned in the key of D, a tradition begun by the Taylor brothers (originally of Drogheda, Ireland, and later of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) in the late 19th century. Canon Goodman played a Taylor set. Up to then, most pipes were what would be termed as &quot;flat sets&quot; in other keys, such as D, C, B and B, tunings which were largely incompatible with playing with other instruments. The chanter length determines the overall tuning; accompanying pieces of the instrument, such as drones and regulators, are tuned to the same key as the chanter. Chanters of around in length produce a bottom note on or near D4 (D above middle C) where A4 = 440 Hz, i.e. modern &quot;concert pitch&quot;. Such pipes are a relatively recent invention pioneered by the Taylor brothers. They typically have wider bores and larger tone holes than the earlier &quot;flat&quot; pitch sets, and as a consequence are a good deal louder, though by no means as loud as the Highland pipes of Scotland. They were developed by the Taylors to meet the requirements of playing in larger venues in the United States; today they are the most common type of uilleann pipes encountered, though many players still prefer the mellower sound of the earlier style narrow-bore pipes, which exist in pitches ranging from D through D, C, and B down to B. Pipemakers before the Taylors had, however, built concert pitch pipes using the narrower bores and smaller fingerholes of the flat pipes. Some of these instruments seem to have been designed with lower pitch standards in mind, such as A4 = 415 Hz. The Taylors also built many instruments with higher pitch standards in mind, such as the Old Philharmonic pitch of A4 = 453 Hz that was commonplace in late 19th-century America.

The D pipes are most commonly used in ensembles, while the flat-pitched pipes are more often used for solo playing – often fiddlers will tune down their instrument to play with a piper&#x27;s flat set, but the inflexibility of other instruments used in Irish music (accordions, flutes, etc.) does not usually permit this. It is noteworthy that Irish music was predominantly solo music until the late 19th century, when these fixed-pitch instruments began to play more of a role. Like some older pipe organs, uilleann pipes are not normally tuned to even temperament, but rather to just intonation, so that the chanter and regulators can blend sweetly with the three drones. Equal temperament is almost universal with the fixed pitch instruments used in Irish music, which can clash with the tuning of the pipes.

==Instrument variations==
A full set of uilleann pipes includes a chanter, drones, and regulators. A half-set lacks the regulators, and a practice set lacks both regulators and drones. All three are used in professional performance.
===Practice set===
Because of the instrument&#x27;s complexity, beginning uilleann pipers often start out with partial sets known as practice sets. A practice set consists of only the basic elements of pipe bag, bellows and chanter, with no drones or regulators. The chanter is available in keys ranging from the &quot;concert pitch&quot; D chanter in half-note steps downward to a B chanter, the latter being regularly referred to as a &quot;flat set&quot; (as are any sets below the key of D).

To play the uilleann pipes effectively, students must learn to pump the bellows steadily while controlling the pressure on the bag and playing the chanter simultaneously. So beginners often play on practice sets until they become comfortable with those basic mechanics. Despite their name, however, practice sets are used not only by beginning players but also by some advanced players when they wish to play just the chanter with other musicians, either live or in recording sessions. In these instances, the practice sets can be tuned to equal temperament if needed.

===Half set===

A half set is the next stage up from a practice set. As with other forms of bagpipes, uilleann pipes use &quot;drones&quot;, which are most commonly three pipes accompanying the melody of the chanter with a constant background tonic note. The pipes are generally equipped with three drones: the tenor drone, as the highest sounding pipe, which is pitched the same as the lowest note of the chanter; the baritone drone pitched one octave below that; and the bass drone, as the lowest sounding pipe, two octaves below the bottom note of the chanter. The Pastoral pipes had four drones: these three plus one more that would play a harmony note at the fourth or fifth interval. These drones are connected to the pipe bag by a &quot;stock&quot;. This is an intricately made wooden cylinder tied into the bag (as any other stock) by a thick yarn or hemp thread. The drones connect to the stock, as do the regulators (see full set below). The stock and drones are laid across the right thigh. This is distinct from other forms of bagpipes, in which the drones are usually carried over the shoulder or over the right arm.

The drones can be switched off. This is made possible by a key connected to the stock. The original design of the stock was a hollow cylinder, with two metal tubes running through it to both hold the regulators and independently supply air to them. Thus the regulators could be played with the drones silenced. In the late 19th century it became more common to build the stock from a solid piece of wood, with five holes bored through it end-to-end. This was less susceptible to damage than the earlier design. The piper is also able to switch on and off various drones individually (applying slightly more pressure to the bag and tapping the end of a drone), which is generally used to aid in tuning (a technique used in almost all bagpipes that have drones) or all of them at the same time using this key. This makes the instrument more versatile and usable not only as a half set, but also to allow playing the chanter by itself. The drones use a single-bladed reed (the actual part creating sound), unlike the double reed used in the chanter and the regulators. These drone reeds were generally made from elderberry twigs in the past, while cane began to be used in the late 19th century.

===Full set===
A full set, as the name implies, is a complete set of uilleann pipes. This would be a half set with the addition of three regulators. These are three closed pipes, similar to the chanter, held in the stock. Like the drones, they are usually given the terms tenor, baritone, and bass, from smallest to largest. A regulator uses keys (five on the tenor and four on both baritone and bass) to accompany the melody of the chanter; these keys are arranged in rows to give limited two-note &quot;chords&quot; or, alternatively, single notes for emphasis on phrases or specific notes. The notes of the regulators, from highest to lowest (given a nominal pitch of D) are as follows: tenor: C, B, A, G, F; baritone: A, G, F, D; bass: C, B, A, G. The tenor and baritone regulators fit into the front face of the stock, on top of the drones; the bass regulator is attached to the side of the stock (furthest from the piper), and is of complex construction.
Another method of using the regulators is to play what are referred to as &quot;hand chords&quot;: when the melody (usually in a slower piece of music such as an air) is being played on the chanter exclusively with the left hand, the right hand will be free to create more complex chords, using all three regulators at once if so desired. Many airs end a section on a G or A in the first octave, at which point a piper will often play one of these hand chords for dramatic effect.

===Chanter===
The chanter is the part of the uilleann pipes that is used to play the melody. It has eight finger holes (example given of a D pitched chanter): bottom D, E, E, F, G, A, B, C, C, high D (also called &quot;back D&quot;). To achieve the bottom D (D4) the chanter is lifted off the knee, exposing the exit of the chanter&#x27;s bore, where the note is produced. The chanter is set on the right knee thus closing off the bottom hole. Many players use a strip of leather placed over the knee, called a &quot;popping strap&quot;, which provides for an airtight seal. More rarely, a simple gravity- or spring-operated flap valve attached to the bottom of the chanter achieves the same end. Generally, for all other notes (except for special effects, or to vary the volume and tone) the chanter stays on the knee.

One characteristic of the chanter is that it can produce staccato notes, because the piper seals it off at the bottom; with all of the finger holes closed, the chanter is silenced. This is also necessary for obtaining the second octave; the chanter must be closed and the bag pressure increased, and then fingered notes will sound in the second octave. A great range of different timbres can be achieved by varying the fingering of notes and also raising the chanter off the knee, which gives the uilleann pipes a degree of dynamic range not found in other forms of bagpipes. Pipers who use staccato fingering often are termed &quot;closed-style&quot; pipers. Those who use legato fingering more predominately are referred to as &quot;open-style&quot; pipers. Open piping has historical associations with musicians (often Irish travelling people) who played on the street or outdoors, since the open fingering is somewhat louder, especially with the chanter played off the knee (which can, however, lead to faulty pitch with the second octave notes).

A type of simultaneous vibrato and tremolo can be achieved by tapping a finger below the open note hole on the chanter. The bottom note also has two different &quot;modes&quot;, namely the &quot;soft D&quot; and the &quot;hard D&quot;. The hard bottom D sounds louder and more strident than the soft D and is accomplished by applying slightly more pressure to the bag and flicking a higher note finger as it is sounded. Pipemakers tune the chanter so the hard D is the in-tune note, the soft D usually being slightly flat.

Many chanters are fitted with keys to allow accurate playing of all the semitones of the scale. Four keys will give all the semitones: F, G, B, C. Older chanters usually had another key for producing D6 (D in the third octave), and often another small key for E6, and another for D5 (as opposed to the E fingerhole, which could be slightly off-pitch). Most uilleann chanters are very responsive to &quot;half-holing&quot; or &quot;sliding&quot;, which is the practice of obtaining a note by leaving a fingerhole only half-covered. This is why many chanters sold in Ireland are sold without keys. With this technique and some practice, many pipers can accurately play the semitones which would otherwise require a chromatic key to be installed. The exception to this is the C6 (C in the second octave), which cannot be cross-fingered or half-holed, and requires the key. This is the most commonly fitted key.

The chanter uses a double reed, similar to that of the oboe or bassoon. Unlike most reed instruments, the uilleann pipe reed must be crafted so that it can play two full octaves accurately, without the fine tuning allowed by the use of a player&#x27;s lips; only bag pressure and fingering patterns can be used to maintain the correct pitch of each note. It is for this reason that making uilleann-pipe chanter reeds is a demanding task. Uilleann pipe reeds are also often called &quot;the piper&#x27;s despair&quot; for the immense difficulty of maintaining, tuning and especially making the double reed of the regulators and, most importantly, the chanter.

<text>Tensegrity, tensional integrity or floating compression is a structural principle based on a system of isolated components under compression inside a network of continuous tension, and arranged in such a way that the compressed members (usually bars or struts) do not touch each other while the prestressed tensioned members (usually cables or tendons) delineate the system spatially.

Tensegrity structures are found in both nature and human-made objects: in the human body, the bones are held in compression while the connective tissues are held in tension, and the same principles have been applied to furniture and architectural design and beyond.

The term was coined by Buckminster Fuller in the 1960s as a portmanteau of &quot;tensional integrity&quot;.

== Core Concept ==

Tensegrity is characterized by several foundational principles that define its unique properties:

# Continuous Tension: Fundamental to tensegrity, the tension elements—typically cables or tendons—form a continuous network that encases the entire structure. This allows for the even distribution of mechanical stresses and maintains the structural form, contributing to the overall stability and flexibility of the system.
# Discontinuous Compression: The compression components, such as struts or rods, are distinct in that they do not make direct contact with each other but are instead suspended within the tension network. This eliminates the need for rigid connections, enhancing the structural efficiency and resilience of the system.
# Pre-stressed: A key aspect of tensegrity structures is their pre-stressed state, in which tension elements are tightened during the assembly process. Pre-stressing contributes significantly to the structural stiffness and stability, ensuring that all elements are either in tension or compression at all times.
# Self-equilibration: Tensegrity structures are self-equilibrating and so automatically distribute internal stresses across the structure. This allows them to adapt to varying loads without losing structural integrity.
# Minimalism and Efficiency: Tensegrity systems employ a minimalist design philosophy, utilizing the minimum amount of materials to achieve maximum structural strength. 
# Scalability and Modularity: The design principles of tensegrity allow for scalability and modular construction. Tensegrity structures to be easily adapted or expanded in size and complexity according to specific requirements.

Because of these patterns, no structural member experiences a bending moment and there are no shear stresses within the system. This can produce exceptionally strong and rigid structures for their mass and for the cross section of the components.

These principles collectively enable tensegrity structures to achieve a balance of strength, resilience, and flexibility, making the concept widely applicable across disciplines including architecture, robotics, and biomechanics.

== Early Example ==
A conceptual building block of tensegrity is seen in the 1951 Skylon. Six cables, three at each end, hold the tower in position. The three cables connected to the bottom &quot;define&quot; its location. The other three cables are simply keeping it vertical.

A three-rod tensegrity structure (shown above in a spinning drawing of a T3-Prism) builds on this simpler structure: the ends of each green rod look like the top and bottom of the Skylon. As long as the angle between any two cables is smaller than 180°, the position of the rod is well defined. While three cables are the minimum required for stability, additional cables can be attached to each node for aesthetic purposes and for redundancy. For example, Snelson&#x27;s Needle Tower uses a repeated pattern built using nodes that are connected to 5 cables each.

Eleanor Heartney points out visual transparency as an important aesthetic quality of these structures. Korkmaz &quot;et al.&quot; has argued that lightweight tensegrity structures are suitable for adaptive architecture.

== Applications ==

=== Architecture ===
Tensegrities saw increased application in architecture beginning in the 1960s, when Maciej Gintowt and Maciej Krasiński designed Spodek arena complex (in Katowice, Poland), as one of the first major structures to employ the principle of tensegrity. The roof uses an inclined surface held in check by a system of cables holding up its circumference. Tensegrity principles were also used in David Geiger&#x27;s Seoul Olympic Gymnastics Arena (for the 1988 Summer Olympics), and the Georgia Dome (for the 1996 Summer Olympics). Tropicana Field, home of the Tampa Bay Rays major league baseball team, also has a dome roof supported by a large tensegrity structure.
On 4 October 2009, the Kurilpa Bridge opened across the Brisbane River in Queensland, Australia. A multiple-mast, cable-stay structure based on the principles of tensegrity, it is currently the world&#x27;s largest tensegrity bridge.

=== Robotics ===
Since the early 2000s, tensegrities have also attracted the interest of roboticists due to their potential to design lightweight and resilient robots. Numerous researches have investigated tensegrity rovers, bio-mimicking robots, and modular soft robots. The most famous tensegrity robot is the Super Ball Bot, a rover for space exploration using a 6-bar tensegrity structure, currently under developments at NASA Ames.

=== Anatomy ===
Biotensegrity, a term coined by Stephen Levin, is an extended theoretical application of tensegrity principles to biological structures. Biological structures such as muscles, bones, fascia, ligaments and tendons, or rigid and elastic cell membranes, are made strong by the unison of tensioned and compressed parts. The musculoskeletal system consists of a continuous network of muscles and connective tissues, while the bones provide discontinuous compressive support, whilst the nervous system maintains tension in vivo through electrical stimulus. Levin claims that the human spine, is also a tensegrity structure although there is no support for this theory from a structural perspective.

=== Biochemistry ===
Donald E. Ingber has developed a theory of tensegrity to describe numerous phenomena observed in molecular biology. For instance, the expressed shapes of cells, whether it be their reactions to applied pressure, interactions with substrates, etc., all can be mathematically modelled by representing the cell&#x27;s cytoskeleton as a tensegrity. Furthermore, geometric patterns found throughout nature (the helix of DNA, the geodesic dome of a volvox, Buckminsterfullerene, and more) may also be understood based on applying the principles of tensegrity to the spontaneous self-assembly of compounds, proteins, and even organs. This view is supported by how the tension-compression interactions of tensegrity minimize material needed to maintain stability and achieve structural resiliency, although the comparison with inert materials within a biological framework has no widely accepted premise within physiological science. Therefore, natural selection pressures would likely favor biological systems organized in a tensegrity manner.

As Ingber explains:
In embryology, Richard Gordon proposed that embryonic differentiation waves are propagated by an &#x27;organelle of differentiation&#x27; where the cytoskeleton is assembled in a bistable tensegrity structure at the apical end of cells called the &#x27;cell state splitter&#x27;.

== Origins and art history ==

The origins of tensegrity are not universally agreed upon. Many traditional structures, such as skin-on-frame kayaks and shōji, use tension and compression elements in a similar fashion.

Russian artist Viatcheslav Koleichuk claimed that the idea of tensegrity was invented first by Kārlis Johansons (in Russian as German as Karl Ioganson) (lv), a Soviet avant-garde artist of Latvian descent, who contributed some works to the main exhibition of Russian constructivism in 1921. Koleichuk&#x27;s claim was backed up by Maria Gough for one of the works at the 1921 constructivist exhibition. Snelson has acknowledged the constructivists as an influence for his work (query?). French engineer David Georges Emmerich has also noted how Kārlis Johansons&#x27;s work (and industrial design ideas) seemed to foresee tensegrity concepts.

In fact, some scientific paper proves this fact, showing the images of the first Simplex structures (made with 3 bars and 9 tendons) developed by Ioganson.

In 1948, artist Kenneth Snelson produced his innovative &quot;X-Piece&quot; after artistic explorations at Black Mountain College (where Buckminster Fuller was lecturing) and elsewhere. Some years later, the term &quot;tensegrity&quot; was coined by Fuller, who is best known for his geodesic domes. Throughout his career, Fuller had experimented with incorporating tensile components in his work, such as in the framing of his dymaxion houses.

Snelson&#x27;s 1948 innovation spurred Fuller to immediately commission a mast from Snelson. In 1949, Fuller developed a tensegrity-icosahedron based on the technology, and he and his students quickly developed further structures and applied the technology to building domes. After a hiatus, Snelson also went on to produce a plethora of sculptures based on tensegrity concepts. His main body of work began in 1959 when a pivotal exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art took place. At the MOMA exhibition, Fuller had shown the mast and some of his other work. At this exhibition, Snelson, after a discussion with Fuller and the exhibition organizers regarding credit for the mast, also displayed some work in a vitrine.

Snelson&#x27;s best-known piece is his &quot;Needle Tower&quot; of 1968.

== Mathematics of Tensegrity ==
The loading of at least some tensegrity structures causes an auxetic response and negative Poisson ratio, e.g. the T3-prism and 6-strut tensegrity icosahedron.

=== Tensegrity prisms ===

The three-rod tensegrity structure (3-way prism) has the property that, for a given (common) length of compression member &quot;rod&quot; (there are three total) and a given (common) length of tension cable &quot;tendon&quot; (six total) connecting the rod ends together, there is a particular value for the (common) length of the tendon connecting the rod tops with the neighboring rod bottoms that causes the structure to hold a stable shape. For such a structure, it is straightforward to prove that the triangle formed by the rod tops and that formed by the rod bottoms are rotated with respect to each other by an angle of 5π/6 (radians).

The stability (&quot;prestressability&quot;) of several 2-stage tensegrity structures are analyzed by Sultan, et al.

The T3-prism (also known as Triplex) can be obtained through form finding of a straight triangular prism. Its self-equilibrium state is given when the base triangles are in parallel planes separated by an angle of twist of π/6. The formula for its unique self-stress state is given by,formula_1Here, the first three negative values correspond to the inner components in compression, while the rest correspond to the cables in tension.

=== Tensegrity icosahedra ===


The tensegrity icosahedron, first studied by Snelson in 1949, has struts and tendons along the edges of a polyhedron called Jessen&#x27;s icosahedron. It is a stable construction, albeit with infinitesimal mobility. To see this, consider a cube of side length , centered at the origin. Place a strut of length in the plane of each cube face, such that each strut is parallel to one edge of the face and is centered on the face. Moreover, each strut should be parallel to the strut on the opposite face of the cube, but orthogonal to all other struts. If the Cartesian coordinates of one strut are and , those of its parallel strut will be, respectively, and . The coordinates of the other strut ends (vertices) are obtained by permuting the coordinates, e.g., (rotational symmetry in the main diagonal of the cube).

The distance &quot;s&quot; between any two neighboring vertices and is
:formula_2

Imagine this figure built from struts of given length and tendons (connecting neighboring vertices) of given length &quot;s&quot;, with formula_3. The relation tells us there are two possible values for &quot;d&quot;: one realized by pushing the struts together, the other by pulling them apart. In the particular case formula_4 the two extremes coincide, and formula_5, therefore the figure is the stable tensegrity icosahedron. This choice of parameters gives the vertices the positions of Jessen&#x27;s icosahedron; they are different from the regular icosahedron, for which the ratio of formula_6 and formula_7 would be the golden ratio, rather than 2. However both sets of coordinates lie along a continuous family of positions ranging from the cuboctahedron to the octahedron (as limit cases), which are linked by a helical contractive/expansive transformation. This kinematics of the cuboctahedron is the &quot;geometry of motion&quot; of the tensegrity icosahedron. It was first described by H. S. M. Coxeter and later called the &quot;jitterbug transformation&quot; by Buckminster Fuller.

Since the tensegrity icosahedron represents an extremal point of the above relation, it has infinitesimal mobility: a small change in the length &quot;s&quot; of the tendon (e.g. by stretching the tendons) results in a much larger change of the distance 2&quot;d&quot; of the struts.

<text>In religion and folklore, paradise is a place of everlasting happiness, delight, and bliss. Paradisiacal notions are often laden with pastoral imagery, and may be cosmogonical, eschatological, or both, often contrasted with the miseries of human civilization: in paradise there is only peace, prosperity, and happiness. Paradise is a place of contentment, a land of luxury and fulfillment containing ever-lasting bliss and delight. Paradise is often described as a &quot;higher place&quot;, the holiest place, in contrast to this world, or underworlds such as hell.

In eschatological contexts, paradise is imagined as an abode of the virtuous dead. In Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, heaven is a paradisiacal belief. In Hinduism and Buddhism, paradise and heaven are synonymous, with higher levels available to beings who have achieved special attainments of virtue and meditation. In old Egyptian beliefs, the underworld is Aaru, the reed-fields of ideal hunting and fishing grounds where the dead lived after judgment. For the Celts, it was the Fortunate Isle of Mag Mell. For the classical Greeks, the Elysian fields was a paradisiacal land of plenty where adherents hoped the heroic and righteous dead would spend eternity. In the Zoroastrian Avesta, the &quot;Best Existence&quot; and the &quot;House of Song&quot; are places of the righteous dead. On the other hand, in cosmogonical contexts &#x27;paradise&#x27; describes the world before it was tainted by evil.

The concept is a theme in art and literature, particularly of the pre-Enlightenment era. John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; is an example of such usage.

==Etymology and concept history==
The word &quot;paradise&quot; entered English from the French &quot;paradis&quot;, inherited from the Latin &quot;paradisus&quot;, from Greek &quot;parádeisos&quot; (παράδεισος), from an Old Iranian form, from Proto-Iranian&quot;*parādaiĵah-&quot; &quot;walled enclosure&quot;, whence Old Persian 𐎱𐎼𐎭𐎹𐎭𐎠𐎶 &quot;p-r-d-y-d-a-m /paridaidam/&quot;, Avestan &quot;pairi-daêza-&quot;. The literal meaning of this Eastern Old Iranian language word is &quot;walled (enclosure)&quot;, from &quot;pairi-&quot; &#x27;around&#x27; (cognate with Greek , English peri- of identical meaning) and &quot;-diz&quot; &quot;to make, form (a wall), build&quot; (cognate with Greek &#x27;wall&#x27;). The word&#x27;s etymology is ultimately derived from a PIE root &quot;*dheigʷ&quot; &quot;to stick and set up (a wall)&quot;, and &quot;*per&quot; &quot;around&quot;.

By the 6th/5th century BCE, the Old Iranian word had been borrowed into Assyrian &quot;pardesu&quot; &quot;domain&quot;. It subsequently came to indicate the expansive walled gardens of the First Persian Empire, and was subsequently borrowed into Greek as παράδεισος &quot;parádeisos&quot; &quot;park for animals&quot; in the &quot;Anabasis&quot; of the early 4th century BCE Athenian Xenophon, Aramaic as &quot;pardaysa&quot; &quot;royal park&quot;, and Hebrew as פַּרְדֵּס &quot;pardes&quot;, &quot;orchard&quot; (appearing thrice in the Tanakh; in the Song of Solomon (), Ecclesiastes () and Nehemiah ()). In the Septuagint (3rd–1st centuries BCE), Greek παράδεισος &quot;parádeisos&quot; was used to translate both Hebrew פרדס &quot;pardes&quot; and Hebrew גן &quot;&quot;, &quot;garden&quot; (e.g. (, ): it is from this usage that the use of &quot;paradise&quot; to refer to the Garden of Eden derives. The same usage also appears in Arabic and in the Quran as &quot;firdaws&quot; فردوس.

The idea of a walled enclosure was not preserved in most Iranian usage, and generally came to refer to a plantation or other cultivated area, not necessarily walled. For example, the Old Iranian word survives as &quot;Pardis&quot; in New Persian as well as its derivative &quot;pālīz&quot; (or &quot;jālīz&quot;), which denotes a vegetable patch.

==Biblical==

===Hebrew Bible===

The Hebrew word &quot;pardes&quot; appears only in the post-Exilic period (after 538 BCE); it occurs in the Song of Songs 4:13, Ecclesiastes 2:5, and Nehemiah 2:8, in each case meaning &quot;park&quot; or &quot;garden&quot;, the original Persian meaning of the word, where it describes the royal parks of Cyrus the Great by Xenophon in Anabasis.

In Second Temple era Judaism, &quot;paradise&quot; came to be associated with the Garden of Eden and prophecies of restoration of Eden, and transferred to heaven.

In the apocryphal Apocalypse of Moses, Adam and Eve are expelled from paradise (rather than Eden) after the Fall of man, having been tricked by the serpent. After the death of Adam, the Archangel Michael carries Adam&#x27;s body to be buried in Paradise, in the Third Heaven.

===New Testament===

The Greek word &quot;παράδεισος&quot; appears three times in the New Testament:
* Luke 23:43 – by Jesus on the cross, in response to the thief&#x27;s request that Jesus remember him when he came into his kingdom.
* 2 Cor. 12:4 – in Paul&#x27;s description of a third heaven paradise.
* Rev. 2:7 – alluding to the tree of life mentioned at Gen.2:8.

==Judaism==

According to Jewish eschatology, the higher Gan Eden is called the &quot;Garden of Righteousness&quot;. It has been created since the beginning of the world, and will appear gloriously at the end of time. The righteous dwelling there will enjoy the sight of the heavenly &quot;chayot&quot; carrying the throne of God. Each of the righteous will walk with God, who will lead them in a dance. Its Jewish and non-Jewish inhabitants are &quot;clothed with garments of light and eternal life, and eat of the tree of life&quot; (Enoch 58,3) near to God and His anointed ones. This Jewish rabbinical concept of a higher Gan Eden is opposed by the Hebrew terms &quot;gehinnom&quot; (the source, via Yiddish, of the English &quot;Gehenna&quot;) and &quot;sheol&quot;, figurative names for the place of spiritual purification for the wicked dead in Judaism, a place envisioned as being at the greatest possible distance from heaven.

===Rabbinic Judaism===
In modern Jewish eschatology it is believed that history will complete itself and the ultimate destination will be when all mankind returns to the Garden of Eden.

In the Talmud and the Jewish Kabbalah, the scholars agree that there are two types of spiritual places called &quot;Garden in Eden&quot;. The first is rather terrestrial, of abundant fertility and luxuriant vegetation, known as the &quot;lower Gan Eden&quot;. The second is envisioned as being celestial, the habitation of righteous, Jewish and non-Jewish, immortal souls, known as the &quot;higher Gan Eden&quot;. The rabbis differentiate between &quot;Gan&quot; and Eden. Adam is said to have dwelt only in the &quot;Gan&quot;, whereas Eden is said never to be witnessed by any mortal eye. In Rabbinic Judaism, the word &#x27;Pardes&#x27; recurs, but less often in the Second Temple context of Eden or restored Eden. A well-known reference is in the Pardes story, where the word may allude to mystic philosophy.

The Zohar gives the word a mystical interpretation, and associates it with the four kinds of Biblical exegesis: &quot;peshat&quot; (literal meaning), &quot;remez&quot; (allusion), &quot;derash&quot; (anagogical), and &quot;sod&quot; (mystic). The initial letters of those four words then form – &quot;p(a)rd(e)s&quot;, which was in turn felt to represent the fourfold interpretation of the Torah (in which &quot;sod&quot; – the mystical interpretation – ranks highest).

==Christianity==


In the 2nd century AD, Irenaeus distinguished paradise from heaven. In &quot;Against Heresies&quot;, he wrote that only those deemed worthy would inherit a home in heaven, while others would enjoy paradise, and the rest live in the restored Jerusalem (which was mostly a ruin after the Jewish–Roman wars but was rebuilt beginning with Constantine the Great in the 4th century). Origen likewise distinguished paradise from heaven, describing paradise as the earthly &quot;school&quot; for souls of the righteous dead, preparing them for their ascent through the celestial spheres to heaven.

Many early Christians identified Abraham&#x27;s bosom with paradise, where the souls of the righteous go until the resurrection of the dead; others were inconsistent in their identification of paradise, such as St. Augustine, whose views varied.

In Luke 23:43, Jesus has a conversation with one of those crucified with him, who asks, &quot;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom&quot;. Jesus answers him, &quot;Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise&quot;. This has often been interpreted to mean that on that same day the thief and Jesus would enter the intermediate resting place of the dead who were waiting for the Resurrection. Divergent views on paradise, and when one enters it, may have been responsible for a punctuation difference in Luke; for example, the two early Syriac versions translate Luke 23:43 differently. The Curetonian Gospels read &quot;Today I tell you that you will be with me in paradise&quot;, whereas the Sinaitic Palimpsest reads &quot;I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise&quot;. Likewise the two earliest Greek codices with punctuation disagree: Codex Vaticanus has a pause mark (a single dot on the baseline) in the original ink equidistant between &#x27;today&#x27; and the following word (with no later corrections and no dot before &quot;today&quot;), whereas Codex Alexandrinus has the &quot;today in paradise&quot; reading. In addition, an adverb of time is never used in the nearly 100 other places in the Gospels where Jesus uses the phrase, &quot;Truly I say to you&quot;.

In Christian art, Fra Angelico&#x27;s &quot;Last Judgement&quot; painting shows Paradise on its left side. There is a tree of life (and another tree) and a circle dance of liberated souls. In the middle is a hole. In Muslim art it similarly indicates the presence of the Prophet or divine beings. It visually says, &quot;Those here cannot be depicted&quot;.

===Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses===

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe, from their interpretation of the Book of Genesis, that God&#x27;s original purpose was, and is, to have the earth filled with the offspring of Adam and Eve as caretakers of a global paradise. However, Adam and Eve rebelled against God&#x27;s sovereignty and were banished from the Garden of Eden, driven out of paradise into toil and misery.

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that disobedient and wicked people will be destroyed by Christ at Armageddon and those obedient to Christ will live eternally in a restored earthly paradise. Joining the survivors will be the resurrected righteous and unrighteous people who died prior to Armageddon. The latter are brought back because they paid for their sins by their death and/or because they lacked opportunity to learn of Jehovah&#x27;s requirements before dying. These will be judged on the basis of their post-resurrection obedience to instructions revealed in new &quot;scrolls&quot;. They believe that resurrection of the dead to paradise earth is made possible by Christ&#x27;s blood and the ransom sacrifice. This provision does not apply to those whom Christ as Judge deems to have sinned against God&#x27;s holy spirit.

One of Jesus&#x27; statements before he died were the words to a man hanging alongside him, &quot;you will be with me in Paradise.&quot; The New World Translation places a comma after the word &#x27;today&#x27;, dividing it into two separate phrases, &quot;I tell you today&quot; and &quot;you will be with me in Paradise&quot;. This differs from standard translations of this verse as &quot;I tell you today you will be with me in Paradise&quot;. Based on scriptures such as Matthew 12:40, 27:63, Mark 8:31 and 9:31, Witnesses believe Jesus&#x27; expectation that he would be bodily resurrected after three days precluded his being in paradise on the same day that he died.

===Mormonism===
In Latter Day Saint theology, paradise usually refers to the spirit world, the place where spirits dwell following death and awaiting the resurrection. In that context, &quot;paradise&quot; is the state of the righteous after death. In contrast, the wicked and those who have not yet learned the gospel of Jesus Christ await the resurrection in spirit prison. After the universal resurrection, all persons will be assigned to a particular kingdom or degree of glory. This may also be termed &quot;paradise&quot;.

==Islam==
In the Quran, Heaven is denoted as &quot;Jannah&quot; (garden), with the highest level being called &quot;Firdaus&quot;, i.e. Paradise. It is used instead of Heaven to describe the ultimate pleasurable place after death, accessible by those who pray, donate to charity, and believe in: Allah, the angels, his revealed books, his prophets and messengers, the Day of Judgement and divine decree (Qadr), and follow God&#x27;s will in their life. Heaven in Islam is used to describe skies in the literal sense and metaphorically to refer to the universe. In Islam, the bounties and beauty of Heaven are immense, so much so that they are beyond the abilities of mankind&#x27;s worldly mind to comprehend.
There are eight doors of Jannah. These are eight grades of Jannah: 
* 1. Jannah al-Mawa
* 2. Dar al-Maqam
* 3. Dar al-Salam
* 4. Dar al-Khuld
* 5. Jannah al-Adn
* 6. Jannah al-Na&#x27;im
* 7. Jannah al-Kasif
* 8. Jannah al-Firdaus
Jannah al-Mawa is in the lowest, Jannah al-Adn is the middle and Jannah al-Firdaus is the highest.

Imam Bukhari has also recorded the tradition in which the Prophet said,

In this tradition, it is evident that Al-Firdaus is the highest place in Paradise, yet, it is stated that it is in the middle. While giving an explanation of this description of Al-Firdaus, the great scholar, Ibn Hibban states,

This explanation is in agreement to the explanation which has been given by Abu Hurairah (r.a.) who said that

The Quran also gave a warning that not all Muslims or even the believers will assuredly be permitted to enter Jannah except those who had struggled in the name of God and tested from God&#x27;s trials as faced by the messengers of God or ancient prophets:

&quot;Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while such [trial] has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you? They were touched by poverty and hardship and were shaken until [even their] messenger and those who believed with him said,&quot;When is the help of Allah ?&quot; Unquestionably, the help of Allah is near.&quot; — Qur&#x27;an 2:214 (Al-Baqarah) (&quot;Saheeh International&quot;)Other instances where paradise is mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an includes descriptions of springs, silk garments, embellished carpets and women with beautiful eyes. These elements can also be seen as depicted within Islamic art and architecture. &quot;The semblance of Paradise (Jannah) promised the pious and devout (is that of a garden) with streams of water that will not go rank, and rivers of milk whose taste will not undergo a change, and rivers of wine delectable to drinkers, and streams of purified honey, and fruits of every kind in them, and forgiveness from their Lord.&quot; (47:15).

=== References to Paradise (Jannah) in the Qur&#x27;an as reflected in Islamic art ===
The Qur&#x27;an contains multiple passages in which paradise, or &#x27;Jannah&#x27;, is referred to. The Holy Book contains 166 references to gardens, of which nineteen mention &#x27;Jannah&#x27;, connoting both images of paradise through gardens, water features, and fruit-bearing trees. Scholars are unable to confirm that certain artistic choices were solely intended to reflect the Qur&#x27;an&#x27;s description of paradise, since there are not extensive historical records to reference to. However, many elements of Islamic art and architecture can certainly be interpreted as being intended to reflect paradise as described in the Qur&#x27;an, and there are particular historical records which support a number of case studies in this claim.

Historical evidence does support the claim that certain Islamic garden structures and mosaics, particularly those of Spanish, Persian and Indian origins, were intended to mirror a scene of paradise as described in the Qur&#x27;an.

=== Water features in Islamic gardens ===
The Alhambra, Court of the Lions, Grenada, Spain

The structural layout of the gardens of the Alhambra in Grenada, embodies the idea of water as a symbol of representing paradise within Islamic gardens. In particular, the Courtyard of the Lions, which follows the Quarter Garden, or the &#x27;Chahar-Bagh&#x27; layout, typical to Islamic gardens, features a serene water fountain at its centre. The fountain is carved with stone lions, with the water emerging from the mouths of these lions. The static nature of the locally sourced water features within the Courtyard of the Lions at the Alhambra, adds to the atmosphere of serenity and stillness which is typical of Islamic gardens that utilise water features, resembling the image of paradise as found in the Qur&#x27;an.
=== Tomb Gardens as representing Paradise ===
There is not yet concrete evidence that Islamic gardens were solely intended to represent images of paradise. However, it can be deduced from certain inscriptions and intentions of structures, that creating an atmosphere of divinity and serenity were part of the artists&#x27; intentions.

Tombs became the metaphorical &#x27;paradise on Earth&#x27; for Islamic architecture and gardens; they were a place of eternal peace were devout followers of God could rest.

The Taj Mahal

Upon the exterior of the tomb mausoleum of the Taj Mahal, inscriptions of passages from the Qur&#x27;an adorn the exterior facades, encasing the iwans. These inscriptions rehearse passages of an eschatological nature, referencing the Day of Judgement and themes of paradise. Similarly, the placement of the tomb structure within the waterscape garden environment heightens the conceptual relationship between tomb gardens and a place of paradise as discussed in the Qur&#x27;an. Similarly, the white marble used for the construction of the tomb mausoleum, furthers the relationship between the purity and divinity of the tomb, elevating the status of the tomb to that of paradise. 
=== Mosaic representations of paradise within Islamic Architecture ===
Preserved historical writings from an interview with the artisan of the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque at Medina between 705 and 715, revealed how the mosaic depictions of gardens within this mosque were in fact created &quot;according to the picture of the Tree of Paradise and its palaces&quot;. Structures that are similarly adorned with naturalistic mosaics, and were created during the same period as the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque at Medina, can be said to have had the same intended effect.

The mosaic of the Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem

Constructed between 690 and 692, the Dome of the Rock at Jerusalem features a large-scale mosaic on the interior of the domed structure. It is likely that this richly embellished and detailed mosaic was intended to replicate an image of paradise, featuring fruit-bearing trees, vegetal motifs and flowing rivers. Accompanied by a calligraphic frieze, the mosaic depicts symmetrical and vegetal vine scrolls, surrounded by trees of blue, green and turquoise mosaics. Jewel-like embellishments as well as gold pigment complete the mosaic. Not only did mosaics of this kind seek to reflect paradise as described in the Qur&#x27;an, but they were also thought to represent and proclaim Muslim victories.

The mosaic of The Great Mosque of Damascus, Syria

In a similar instance, the mosaic within the Great Mosque of Damascus, constructed within a similar timeframe to the Dome of the Rock, features the most noticeable elements of a paradisiacal garden as described in the Qur&#x27;an. Therefore, it would not be unreasonable to suggest that the mosaic on the exterior facade of the Great Mosque of Damascus, was similarly intended to replicate an image of paradise in the viewer&#x27;s mind.

==Gnosticism==
On the Origin of the World, a text from the Nag Hammadi library held in ancient Gnosticism, describes Paradise as being located outside the circuit of the Sun and Moon in the luxuriant Earth east in the midst of stones. The Tree of Life, which will provide for the souls of saints after they come out of their corrupted bodies, is located in the north of Paradise besides the Tree of Knowledge that contains the power of God.

<text>Tampa ( ) is a city on the Gulf Coast of the U.S. state of Florida. Tampa&#x27;s borders include the north shore of Tampa Bay and the east shore of Old Tampa Bay. Tampa is the largest city in the Tampa Bay area and the county seat of Hillsborough County. With an estimated population of 403,364 in 2023, Tampa is the 49th-most populous city in the country and the third-most populous city in Florida after Jacksonville and Miami.

Tampa was founded as a military center in the 19th century, with the establishment of Fort Brooke. The cigar industry was brought to Tampa by Vincente Martinez Ybor, after whom Ybor City is named. Tampa was reincorporated as a city in 1887 following the Civil War. Tampa&#x27;s economy is driven by tourism, health care, finance, insurance, technology, construction, and the maritime industry. The bay&#x27;s port is the largest in the state, responsible for over $15 billion in economic impact.

Tampa is part of the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a four-county area composed of roughly 3.1 million residents, making it the second-largest metropolitan statistical area (MSA) in the state and the sixth largest in the Southeastern United States, behind Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Washington D.C., Atlanta, and Miami. The Greater Tampa Bay area has over 4 million residents, and generally includes the Tampa and Sarasota metro areas.

==Etymology==
The earliest instance of the name &quot;Tampa&quot;, in the form &quot;Tanpa&quot;, appears in the memoirs of Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda, who spent 17 years as a captive of the Calusa and traveled through much of peninsular Florida. He described Tanpa as an important Calusa town to the north of the Calusa domain, possibly under another chief. Archaeologist Jerald Milanich places the town of Tanpa at the mouth of Charlotte Harbor. The entrances to Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor are obscured by barrier islands, and their locations, and the names applied to them, were a source of confusion to explorers, surveyors and map-makers from the 16th century to the 18th century. &quot;Bahía Tampa&quot; and &quot;Bahía de Espíritu Santo&quot; were each used, at one time or another, for the modern Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor.

Tampa Bay was labeled &quot;Bahía de Espíritu Santo&quot; (Bay of the Holy Spirit) in the earliest Spanish maps of Florida. It became known as B. Tampa (&quot;Bahía Tampa&quot; or Tampa Bay) as early as 1576. In 1601, &quot;B. Tampa&quot;, corresponding to Tampa Bay, appeared for the first time on a printed map in Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas&#x27;s Description del Destricto del Audiencia de la Espanola, from his book Descripcion de las Indias Ocidentales, printed in Madrid.

A 1705 British map also shows B. Tampa, with &quot;Carlos Bay&quot; for Charlotte Harbor to the south. A 1748 British map had &quot;B. del Spirito Santo&quot; for Tampa Bay and &quot;Carlos Bay&quot; to the south. A Spanish map of 1757 renamed Tampa Bay as &quot;San Fernando&quot;. As late as 1774, Bernard Romans called Tampa Bay &quot;Bay of Espiritu Santo&quot;, with &quot;Tampa Bay&quot; restricted to the Northwest arm, what is now Old Tampa Bay, and the northeast arm named &quot;Hillsborough Bay&quot;. The name may have come from the Calusa language or possibly, the Timucua language. Some scholars have compared &quot;Tampa&quot; to &quot;itimpi&quot;, which means &quot;close to&quot; or &quot;nearby&quot; in the Creek language, but its meaning is not known.

In 1849, when the pioneer community living near the U.S. Army outpost of Fort Brooke was incorporated, it was called &quot;Tampa Town&quot;. In 1855, the name was shortened to simply &quot;Tampa&quot;.

People from Tampa are generally known as &quot;Tampans&quot;, &quot;Tampanians&quot;, or &quot;Tampeños&quot;. In 2014, local authorities consulted by Michael Kruse of the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; suggest that &quot;Tampan&quot; was historically more common, while &quot;Tampanian&quot; became popular when the former term came to be seen as a potential insult. A mix of Cuban, Italian, and Spanish immigrants began arriving in the late 1800s to found and work in the new communities of Ybor City and West Tampa. By about 1900, these newcomers came to be known as &quot;Tampeños&quot;, or &quot;Tampeñas&quot; for females, a term that is still sometimes used to refer to their descendants living in the area, and potentially, to all residents of Tampa regardless of their ethnic background.

==History==

===Indigenous peoples and European exploration===
The shores of Tampa Bay have been inhabited for thousands of years. A variant of the Weeden Island culture developed in the area by about 2,000 years ago. Archeological evidence suggests that these residents relied on the sea for most of their resources, as a vast majority of inhabited sites have been found on or near the shoreline, with little evidence of farming. At the time of European contact in the early 16th century, several chiefdoms of the Safety Harbor culture dominated the area.

Early Spanish explorers interacted most extensively with the Tocobaga, whose principal town was at the northern end of Old Tampa Bay near today&#x27;s Safety Harbor in Pinellas County. While there is a substantial historical record of the Tocobaga, and the Calusa, who lived to the south, there is less surviving documentation describing the Pohoy, who lived near the mouth of the Hillsborough River near today&#x27;s downtown Tampa. Evidence suggests that the language and culture of the Pohoy and other lesser-known groups around the bay were very similar to that of the Tocobaga.

Expeditions led by Pánfilo de Narváez and Hernando de Soto landed near Tampa, but neither conquistador stayed long. There is no natural gold or silver in Florida, and the native inhabitants repulsed Spanish attempts to establish a permanent settlement or convert them to Catholicism. The fighting resulted in a few deaths, but the many more deaths were caused by infectious diseases brought from Europe, which devastated the population of Native Americans across Florida and the entire Western Hemisphere. The indigenous cultures of the Tampa Bay area collapsed by around 1600, leaving the west coast of Spanish Florida largely depopulated and ignored for more than 200 years.

In the mid-18th century, events in the American colonies and the early United States drove the Seminole people into northern Florida. They did not move into central Florida until after the United States gained control of Florida in 1821.

Before the American period, the Tampa Bay area had a handful of residents: Cuban and Native American fishermen who established small seasonal camps called &quot;ranchos&quot; on the shores of Tampa Bay. The largest was at the mouth of Spanishtown Creek in today&#x27;s Hyde Park neighborhood along Bayshore Boulevard.

===U.S. control===
After purchasing Florida from Spain in 1821, the United States built forts and trading posts in the new territory. Fort Brooke was established in January 1824 at the mouth of the Hillsborough River on Tampa Bay, in Downtown Tampa.

Tampa was initially an isolated frontier outpost. The sparse civilian population practically abandoned the area during the Second Seminole War from 1835 to 1842, after which the Seminoles were forced out and many settlers returned.

Florida became the 27th state on March 3, 1845. On January 18, 1849, Tampa was officially incorporated as the &quot;Village of Tampa.&quot; It was home to 185 civilians, or 974 total residents including military personnel, in 1850. Tampa was reincorporated as a town on December 15, 1855.

===Civil War and Reconstruction===

During the Civil War, Florida seceded along with most of the southern states to form the Confederate States of America, and Fort Brooke was defended by Confederate troops. Martial law was declared in Tampa in January 1862, and Tampa&#x27;s city government ceased to operate for the duration of the war.

In 1861, the Union Navy set up a blockade around many southern ports to cut off the Confederacy. Several US Navy ships were stationed near the mouth of Tampa Bay, but small blockade running ships were often able to slip by the blockade to deliver cattle to Spanish Cuba, earning gold for the Confederate cause. On June 30, 1862, the gunboat USS &quot;Sagamore&quot; sailed into Tampa Bay and opened fire on Fort Brooke, which returned fire. The &quot;Sagamore&quot; withdrew after a few hours, and the Battle of Tampa caused little damage. During the Battle of Fort Brooke on October 16 and the Battle of Ballast Point on October 18, 1863, Union forces inflicted serious damage to Tampa&#x27;s economy when, under the cover of another bombardment of the fort, troops landed and destroyed two blockade running ships that had been hidden upstream along the Hillsborough River.

In May 1864, Union troops landed again and took Fort Brooke largely unopposed. They destroyed much of the fort&#x27;s facilities and confiscated the remaining military supplies other than the cannons, which they tossed into the Hillsborough River, then left the &quot;desolate&quot; town after two days.

The Civil War ended in April 1865 with a Confederate defeat. In May 1865, federal troops arrived in Tampa to occupy the fort and the town as part of Reconstruction. They remained until August 1869.

During the immediate post-war period, Tampa was a poor, isolated fishing village with about 1,000 residents and little industry. Yellow fever, borne by mosquitoes from nearby swamps, broke out several times during the 1860s and 1870s, causing more residents to leave. In 1869, residents voted to abolish the city of Tampa government.

In 1870, the population of &quot;Tampa Town&quot; was about 800, and dropped to about 700 by 1880. Fort Brooke was decommissioned in 1883, further impacting the local economy in the short run, but opening up the waterfront for development. Except for two cannons displayed on the University of Tampa campus, all traces of the fort are gone.

===1880s economic prosperity===
In the mid-1880s, Tampa&#x27;s fortunes took several sudden turns for the better. In 1883, phosphate was discovered in the Bone Valley region southeast of Tampa. The mineral, vital for the production of fertilizers and other products, was soon being shipped from the Port of Tampa in great volume. Tampa is still a major phosphate exporter.

The discovery of phosphate, the arrival of Plant&#x27;s railroad, and the founding of Ybor City and West Tampa—all in the mid-1880s—were crucial to Tampa&#x27;s development. The once-struggling village of Tampa became a bustling boomtown almost overnight and had grown into one of the largest cities in Florida by 1900.

====Plant&#x27;s railroad====
In late 1883, Henry B. Plant&#x27;s narrow-gauge South Florida Railroad reached Tampa and its port, connecting the small town to the nation&#x27;s railroad system after years of efforts by local leaders. Previously, Tampa&#x27;s overland transportation links had consisted of sandy roads stretching across the Florida countryside. Plant&#x27;s railroad made it much easier to get goods in and out of the Tampa Bay area. Phosphate and commercial fishing exports could be sent north by rail, and many new products were brought into the Tampa market, along with the first tourists.
====Ybor&#x27;s cigars====

The new railroad link enabled another important industry to come to Tampa. In 1885, the Tampa Board of Trade enticed Vicente Martinez Ybor to move his cigar manufacturing operations to Tampa from Key West. Proximity to Cuba made importation of &quot;clear Havana tobacco&quot; easy by sea, and Plant&#x27;s railroad made shipment of finished cigars to the rest of the US market easy by land.

Since Tampa was still a small town at the time, with a population less than 5,000, Ybor built hundreds of small houses around his factory to accommodate the immediate influx of mainly Cuban and Spanish cigar workers. Ybor City&#x27;s factories rolled their first cigars in 1886, and many different cigar manufacturers moved their operations to town in ensuing years. Many Italian and a few Eastern European Jewish immigrants arrived starting in the late 1880s, opening businesses and shops that catered to cigar workers.

By 1900, over 10,000 immigrants had moved to the neighborhood. Several thousand more Cuban immigrants built West Tampa, another cigar-centric suburb founded a few years later by Hugh MacFarlane. Between them, two &quot;Latin&quot; communities combined to exponentially expand Tampa&#x27;s population, economic base, and tax revenues, as Tampa became the &quot;Cigar Capital of the World&quot;.
===Early 20th century===
During the first few decades of the 20th century, the cigar-making industry was the backbone of Tampa&#x27;s economy. The factories in Ybor City and West Tampa made an enormous number of cigars—in the peak year of 1929, over 500 million cigars were hand rolled in Tampa.

In 1904, a civic association of local businessmen dubbed themselves Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla, named after local mythical pirate José Gaspar, and staged an &quot;invasion&quot; of the city followed by a parade. With a few exceptions, the Gasparilla Pirate Festival has been held every year since.

===Bolita and organized crime===
Beginning in the late 19th century, illegal bolita lotteries were very popular among the Tampa working classes, especially in Ybor City. In the early 1920s, this small-time operation was taken over by Charlie Wall, the rebellious son of a prominent Tampa family, and went big-time. Bolita was able to openly thrive only because of kick-backs and bribes to key local politicians and law enforcement officials, and many were on the take.

Profits from the bolita lotteries and Prohibition-era bootlegging led to the development of several organized crime factions in Tampa. Charlie Wall was the first major boss, but various power struggles culminated in consolidation of control by Sicilian mafioso Santo Trafficante Sr. and his faction in the 1950s. After his death in 1954 from cancer, control passed to his son, Santo Trafficante Jr., who established alliances with families in New York City and extended his power throughout Florida and into Batista-era Cuba.

The era of rampant and open corruption ended in the 1950s, when Estes Kefauver&#x27;s traveling organized crime hearings came to town and were followed by the sensational misconduct trials of several local officials. Although many of the worst offenders in government and the mob were not charged, the trials helped to end the sense of lawlessness which had prevailed in Tampa for decades.

===Mid to late 20th century===
Tampa grew considerably as a result of World War II. Prior to the United States&#x27; involvement in the conflict, construction began on MacDill Field, which served as a main base for Army Air Corps and later Army Air Forces operations just before and during World War II, with multiple auxiliary airfields around the Tampa Bay area and surrounding counties. At the end of the war, MacDill remained as an active military installation, while the auxiliary fields reverted to civilian control. Two of these auxiliary fields later became the present-day Tampa International Airport and St. Petersburg–Clearwater International Airport. With the establishment of an independent U.S. Air Force in 1947, MacDill Field became MacDill Air Force Base.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Tampa had record-setting population growth that has not been seen since. This growth spurred expansion of Tampa&#x27;s highways and bridges, bringing thousands into the city and creating opportunities for Tampa business owners, who welcomed the influx of tourists and new residents. It was during this time period in Tampa&#x27;s history that two of the most popular tourist attractions in the area were developed – Busch Gardens and Lowry Park. Many of the well-known institutions that play an important role in the economic development of Tampa were established during this time period.

The University of South Florida was established in North Tampa in 1956 and opened for students in September 1960. The school spurred the construction of several residential and commercial developments in the previously agriculture-dominated area around the new campus. Overall, Tampa continued to expand away from the city center during the 1960s as new hospitals, schools, churches and subdivisions all began appearing to accommodate the growth. Many business offices began moving away from the traditional downtown office building into more convenient neighborhood office plazas.

In 1970, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Tampa&#x27;s population as being 80.0% white and 19.7% black.

Four attempts have been made to consolidate the municipal government of the city of Tampa with the county government of Hillsborough County, in 1967, 1970, 1971, and 1972, all of which failed at the ballot box. The greatest loss was the most recent attempt in 1972, with the final tally being 33,160 (31%) in favor and 73,568 (69%) against the proposed charter.

The biggest recent growth of Tampa was the development of New Tampa, which started in 1988 when the city annexed a mostly rural area of between I-275 and I-75.

East Tampa, historically a mostly black community, was the scene of several race riots during and for some time after the period of racial segregation, mainly due to problems between residents and the Tampa Police Department.

==Geography==

===Topography===
According to the United States Census Bureau, Tampa has a total area of , including of land and (35.3%) of water. The highest point in Tampa is only above sea level. Tampa is bordered by two bodies of water, Old Tampa Bay and Hillsborough Bay, which flow together to form Tampa Bay, which flows into the Gulf of Mexico.

The Hillsborough River flows into Hillsborough Bay, passing directly in front of Downtown Tampa and supplying Tampa&#x27;s main source of fresh water. The Palm River is a smaller river, flowing from just east of the city into McKay Bay, which is a smaller inlet, sited at the northeast end of Hillsborough Bay. Tampa&#x27;s geography is marked by the Interbay Peninsula, which divides Hillsborough Bay in the east, from Old Tampa Bay in the west.

=== Cityscape ===


==== Neighborhoods ====
Tampa is divided into many neighborhoods, many of which were towns and unincorporated communities annexed by the growing city. Generally, Tampa is divided into the following areas: Downtown Tampa, New Tampa, West Tampa, East Tampa, North Tampa, and South Tampa. Well-known neighborhoods include Ybor City, Forest Hills, Ballast Point, Sulphur Springs, Seminole Heights, Tampa Heights, Palma Ceia, Hyde Park, Davis Islands, Harbour Island, Tampa Palms, College Hill, Water Street, Channelside and non-residential areas of Gary and the Westshore Business District.

==== Architecture ====
Tampa displays a wide variety of architectural designs and styles. Most of Tampa&#x27;s high rises demonstrate post-modern architecture. The design for the renovated Tampa Museum of Art displays post-modern architecture, while the city hall and the Tampa Theatre belong to Art Deco architecture.

The Tampa mayor Pam Iorio made the redevelopment of Tampa&#x27;s downtown, especially residential development, a priority. Several residential and mixed-development high-rises have been constructed. Another of Mayor Iorio&#x27;s initiatives was the Tampa Riverwalk, a mixed-use path along the Hillsborough River in downtown. Channelside was approved to undergo major renovations by Tampa Bay Lightning owner Jeff Vinik along with Bill Gates and other investors. Several museums have opened, including new homes for the Tampa Bay History Center, the Glazer Children&#x27;s Museum, and the Tampa Museum of Art. The breakdown of development for the rest of the plan is as follows: 39% residential units, 29% office space, 15% hotels, 8% retail, 7% other, and 2% cultural uses. Mayor Bob Buckhorn continued these developments, which are bearing fruit during the term of Mayor Jane Castor.

Tampa is the site of several skyscrapers. Overall, there are 30 completed buildings that rise over high. Tampa also has 147 high-rises, second only to Miami in the state of Florida. The tallest building in the city is 100 North Tampa, formerly the AmSouth Building, which rises 42 floors and in Downtown Tampa. The structure was completed in 1992, and is the tallest building in Florida outside of Miami and Jacksonville.
===== Landmarks =====

The Sulphur Springs Water Tower, a landmark in the Sulphur Springs section of the city, stands 214 feet tall and was built by Grover Poole in the late 1920s. This 1920s boom period for Florida also saw the construction of an ornate movie palace, the Tampa Theatre, a Mediterranean revival on Davis Islands, and Bayshore Boulevard, which borders Hillsborough Bay from downtown Tampa to areas in South Tampa. The road has a continuous sidewalk on the eastern end, the longest in the world.

The Ybor City District is home to several buildings on the National Register of Historic Places and has been declared a National Historic Landmark. Notable structures include El Centro Español de Tampa, Centro Asturiano de Tampa and other social clubs built in the early 1900s. Including L&#x27;Unione Italiana or the Italian Club, at 1731 East 7th Avenue in Ybor City. The Italian Club mission &quot;is to preserve and honor the culture, traditions and heritage of the Italian Community and to maintain the historical facility as a functioning memorial to the working class immigrants.&quot;
Babe Zaharias Golf Course in the Forest Hills area of Tampa has been designated a Historical Landmark by the National Register of Historic Places. It was bought in 1949 by the famous &quot;Babe&quot; Didrikson Zaharias, who had a residence nearby, and closed upon her death. In 1974, the city of Tampa opened the golf course to the public.

&quot;The Story of Tampa&quot;, a public painting by Lynn Ash, is a oil on masonite mural that weaves together many of the notable aspects of Tampa&#x27;s unique character and identity. It was commissioned in 2003 by the city&#x27;s Public Art Program and is in the lobby of the Tampa Municipal Office Building.

Park Tower, originally the First Financial Bank of Florida, is the first substantial skyscraper in downtown Tampa. Completed in 1973, it was the tallest skyscraper in Tampa until the completion of One Tampa City Center in 1981. The Rivergate building, a cylindrical structure known as the &quot;Beer Can building&quot;, was featured in the movie &quot;The Punisher&quot;.

Spanning the southern part of Tampa Bay is the massive steel-span Sunshine Skyway Bridge.

Tampa is home to the Bro Bowl, one of the last remaining skateparks built during skateboarding&#x27;s &quot;Golden Era&quot; in the 1970s. It opened in 1979 and was constructed by Tampa Parks and Recreation in 1978. It was the first public skatepark to be constructed in Florida and the third on the East Coast.

Other Tampa landmarks include the Tampa Riverwalk, which is a open space and pedestrian trail development along the Hillsborough River, and Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park.

===Climate===
The Tampa Bay area has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), although due to its location on the Florida peninsula on Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, it shows some characteristics of a tropical climate. Tampa has hot and humid summers with frequent thunderstorms and dry and mild winters. Average highs range from year round, and lows . The city of Tampa is split between two USDA climate zones. In the 2012 USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map, Tampa is listed as USDA zone 9b north of Kennedy Boulevard away from the bay and 10a near the shorelines and in the interbay peninsula south of Kennedy Boulevard. Zone 10a is about the northern limit of where coconut palms and royal palms can be grown, although some specimens do grow in northern Tampa. Recently, certain palm tree species in the area, along with the rest of the state, have been and continue to be severely affected by a plant disease called Texas phoenix palm decline, which has caused a considerable amount of damage to various local palm tree landscapes and threatens the native palm tree species in the region.

===Tropical storms===
Though threatened by tropical systems almost every hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30, Tampa has seldom felt major effects from tropical storms or hurricanes. No hurricane has made landfall in the immediate Tampa Bay area since the category 4 1921 Tampa Bay hurricane made landfall near Tarpon Springs and caused extensive damage throughout the region.

Over the past few decades, four major hurricanes were forecast to hit the Tampa Bay area from the south-southwest, which is a worst-case track that would result in a maximum storm surge event: Hurricane Donna (1960), Hurricane Charley (2004), Hurricane Irma (2017), and Hurricane Ian (2022). All of these storms veered to the east or northeast before reaching Tampa Bay and instead made landfall down the coast, resulting in serious damage in southwest Florida. Irma had the greatest effect on Tampa. It made landfall near Marco Island on September 10, 2017, and moved due north, passing through eastern Hillsborough County as a Category 1 storm and causing widespread issues in the area, particularly disrupting the electrical grid for several days.

Because of tremendous population growth and coastal development in the century since the last hurricane landfall, combined with rising sea levels due to climate change, the Tampa Bay Area is considered one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to a direct hit from a major storm.

===Seasonal trends===

====Summer====
Summertime weather patterns predominate from late May to early October, which is the region&#x27;s rainy season. Daily weather is very consistent during this period, with daytime highs averaging about , lows usually in the mid- to upper 70s °F (23–25 °C), high humidity, and a regular chance of rain, especially in the afternoon.

Since the Tampa area is home to a diverse range of freeze-sensitive agriculture and aquaculture, hard freezes, although quite rare, are a major concern. Hard freezes, defined as a temperature of or below for several hours, occur rarely in the Tampa area, every five to twenty years depending on the exact location.

====Spring====
Tampa has a slow increase in average temperatures beginning in mid-February, and spring brings mostly warm and sunny weather to the area. While temperatures in late spring approach summertime values, the rainy season does not usually begin until June, leading to the threat of brush fires from approximately late March until May. Occasionally, a late-season cold front pushes through the area, potentially bringing a brief round of severe weather followed by a few days of unseasonably cool temperatures.

==Sports==
*Co-champions, championship game canceled due to COVID-19 pandemic.

Tampa is currently represented by teams in three major professional sports leagues: the National Football League, the National Hockey League, and Major League Baseball. The NFL&#x27;s Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the NHL&#x27;s Tampa Bay Lightning call Tampa home, while the Tampa Bay Rays of the MLB play across the bay in St. Petersburg (though they spent the 2025 season at George M. Steinbrenner Field following the damage to Tropicana Field by Hurricane Milton). As indicated by their names, these teams, plus several other sports teams, represent the entire Tampa metropolitan area. Tampa Bay&#x27;s professional teams have won eight combined championships in their respective leagues.

The Tampa Bay area has long been a site for Major League Baseball spring training facilities and minor league baseball teams. The New York Yankees conduct spring training in Tampa, and their Low-A affiliate Tampa Tarpons play there in the summer.

On the collegiate level, the University of South Florida Bulls compete in 17 sports in NCAA Division I and the University of Tampa Spartans compete in 20 sports in NCAA Division II.

Between September 2020 and July 2021 all three of Tampa Bay&#x27;s major teams, as well as the Tampa Bay Rowdies, qualified for their sport&#x27;s championship series. The Lightning beat the Dallas Stars in the 2020 Stanley Cup Finals, the Rays lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2020 World Series, the Rowdies and Phoenix Rising FC were named co-league champions after the USL Championship game was canceled due to COVID-19, the Buccaneers beat the Kansas City Chiefs in the first home-game victory in Super Bowl history, and the Lightning beat the Montreal Canadiens in the 2021 Stanley Cup Finals. This dynasty earned the area the nickname &quot;Champa Bay&quot;.

===Football===

====Buccaneers====

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers began in 1976 as an expansion team of the NFL. They struggled at first, losing their first 26 games in a row to set a league record for futility. After a brief taste of success in the late 1970s, the Bucs again returned to their losing ways, and at one point lost at least 10 games for 12 seasons in a row. The hiring of Tony Dungy in 1996 started an improving trend that eventually led to the team&#x27;s victory in Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003 under coach Jon Gruden. They won their second championship in Super Bowl LV with quarterback Tom Brady and became the first NFL team to ever win a Super Bowl at their home stadium.

====Storm====
Originally the Pittsburgh Gladiators and a charter member of the Arena Football League (AFL), the Tampa Bay Storm relocated from Pittsburgh in 1991 and won ArenaBowl V that year. They later won 4 more ArenaBowls (VII, IX, X, and XVII, and also appeared in ArenaBowl I, III, XII, XXIII and XXX), and their five championships were the most in league history. The AFL suffered through several years of decreasing revenue in the 2010s, leading to fewer active franchises. There were only five teams during the 2017 season, after which the Storm&#x27;s ownership group suspended operations.

====Bandits====
Tampa was also home to the Tampa Bay Bandits of the United States Football League. The Bandits made the playoffs twice in their three seasons under head coach Steve Spurrier and drew league-leading crowds to Tampa Stadium, but the team folded along with the rest of the USFL after the 1985 season. They played at Tampa Stadium, which hosted the 1984 USFL Championship Game.

====Vipers====
The Tampa Bay Vipers play in the second edition of the XFL. Their inaugural season was cut short after five weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The team relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada, and now are the Las Vegas Vipers.

====Tornadoes====
The Tampa Bay Tornadoes were founded in 2020 and describe themselves as the successors to the defunct Tampa Bay Storm. They play in the American Arena League.

===Baseball===
====History====
The Tampa Bay area has long been home to nationally competitive amateur baseball and has hosted spring training and minor league teams for over a century. Tampa became the first city in Florida to host a major league team for spring training in 1913, when the Chicago Cubs trained at Plant Field. The Tampa Smokers were the city&#x27;s first minor league team, beginning play as charter members of the new Florida State League in 1919.

====Rays====
After decades of trying to lure an existing Major League Baseball franchise, the Tampa Bay area finally gained a team in 1998, when the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays began play at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg. After a decade of futility on the field, the Devil Rays shortened their nickname to simply Rays in 2008 and promptly won the 2008 American League Pennant, finishing runner up in World Series. They also won American League East titles in 2008 and 2010 under manager Joe Maddon before slipping back in the standings.

In 2007, the Rays began the process of searching for a stadium site closer to the center of the area&#x27;s population, possibly in Tampa. However, over a decade later, rivalry between Tampa and St. Petersburg and the challenges of financing a new ballpark have kept the Rays playing at Tropicana Field.

In 2020, the Rays won the AL East for the first time in a decade with the best record in the American League. Due to the COVID-19 shortened season, 16 teams made the playoffs, so the Rays had to play a best of 3 series against the division rival Toronto Blue Jays in the first round of the Rays postseason, where they swept the visitors in two games at Tropicana Field. then play a divisional series against the New York Yankees, which they won in 5 games at a neutral site in San Diego. The Rays then faced the Astros, who had defeated them in the divisional round the previous year. Tampa Bay went out to a quick 3–0 series lead, but Houston came back to tie the series 3–3. The Rays avoided the reverse sweep in Game 7 and won their second American League Pennant, then lost the World Series in 6 games to the Los Angeles Dodgers.
====Low-A Southeast====
Several Major League baseball teams conduct Spring Training in the area, and most also operate minor league teams in the Low-A Southeast. The major league New York Yankees and the affiliated minor league Tampa Tarpons use George M. Steinbrenner Field across Dale Mabry Highway from Raymond James Stadium.

Across the bay in Pinellas County, the Philadelphia Phillies affiliate Clearwater Threshers and Toronto Blue Jays affiliate Dunedin Blue Jays also play in the Low-A Southeast. Other nearby Low-A Southeast teams include the Pittsburgh Pirates affiliate Bradenton Marauders and the Detroit Tigers affiliate Lakeland Flying Tigers. The Phillies, Blue Jays, Pirates, and Tigers all play their Spring Training games at their minor league teams&#x27; ballparks.

The Tarpons have won five league titles, the Flying Tigers have won four, the Threshers have won two, and the Blue Jays and Marauders have each won one.

The area was formerly home to many teams in the former Florida State League that no longer exist, most notably the Tampa Smokers, St. Petersburg Saints, and the original Tampa Tarpons.

===Hockey===

====Lightning====

The NHL&#x27;s Tampa Bay Lightning, named after the city&#x27;s propensity for attracting lightning unlike any other on the continent, was established in 1992, and play their home games at Amalie Arena in downtown Tampa. In 2004, the team won their first Stanley Cup by defeating the Calgary Flames in 7 games. After this first championship and an ensuing season-wide lockout, the Lightning went 1–3 in four Conference Final appearances in 2011, 2015, 2016 and 2018, winning only in 2015 to lose to the Chicago Blackhawks in the ensuing Finals. Then the Lightning won back-to-back Stanley Cups in 2020 and 2021 with victories over the Dallas Stars and fellow Atlantic Division member Montreal Canadiens respectively.

Tampa hosted the skills contests and 2018 NHL All-Star Game weekend on January 27–28, 2018. Former captain Steve Stamkos is the franchise&#x27;s top scorer with 555 goals across sixteen seasons before signing a new contract with the Nashville Predators after the 2023–24 NHL season.

====Rowdies====
The Tampa Bay Rowdies compete in the United Soccer League Championship after spending their first 6 seasons in the North American Soccer League. The team began play at Tampa&#x27;s George M. Steinbrenner Field in 2010, then moved to St. Petersburg&#x27;s Al Lang Field in 2011. The Rowdies won their first league championship in Soccer Bowl 2012. The Rowdies made the USL Championship Final for the first time in 2020, though it was cancelled due to COVID-19. The Rowdies and the other finalist, Phoenix Rising FC, were named co-champions by the league.

Previously, Tampa had hosted two top-level soccer teams. The Tampa Bay Rowdies of the original North American Soccer League was the area&#x27;s first major sports franchise, beginning play in 1975 at Tampa Stadium. The Rowdies were an immediate success, drawing good crowds and winning Soccer Bowl &#x27;75 in their first season to bring Tampa its first professional sports championship. Though the NASL ceased operations in 1984, the Rowdies continued to compete in various soccer leagues until finally folding in 1993.

====Mutiny====
The success of the Rowdies prompted Major League Soccer (MLS) to award Tampa a charter member of the new league in 1996. The Tampa Bay Mutiny were the first MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield winner and had much early success beginning in 1996. However, the club folded in 2001 when local ownership could not be secured mainly due to a financially poor lease agreement for Raymond James Stadium. The city has no representation in MLS, however, the Rowdies are seeking to join the league.

The Tide&#x27;s home games were played at St. Petersburg Catholic High School, and the Gunners were a travel team.

Amalie Arena was used as the home of the NBA&#x27;s Toronto Raptors for the 2020–2021 season because of Canadian government regulations due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. It was the first time an NBA team played home games in Tampa, though some exhibition preseason games had been played in Tampa between the Orlando Magic and Miami Heat prior to this.
