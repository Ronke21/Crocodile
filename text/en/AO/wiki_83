<text>Sandoval County () is a county located in the U.S. state of New Mexico. As of the 2020 census, the population was 148,834, making it the fourth-most populous county in New Mexico. The county seat is Bernalillo.

Sandoval County is part of the Albuquerque metropolitan area.

==History==
Sandoval County was created in 1903 from the northern part of Bernalillo County. Its name comes from one of the large land-holding Spanish families in the area. The original county seat was Corrales, but it was moved to Bernalillo in 1905.

Mormon Battalion Monument (New Mexico) is in the county.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.1%) is water. The highest point in the county is the summit of Redondo Peak, at .

A relatively small portion of the county exists as a geographically separate exclave between Los Alamos County and Santa Fe County. This came about when Los Alamos County was created; the land that became the exclave would have been part of Los Alamos but was excluded owing to its sacred status among the local Indians. Rather than be ceded to neighboring Santa Fe (or Los Alamos) it has remained part of Sandoval, and is owned by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and under the care of the San Ildefonso Pueblo.

===Adjacent counties===

==Politics==

Since New Mexico obtained statehood in 1912, Sandoval county has been remarkably accurate in predicting the winner of each presidential race. The only elections where Sandoval County failed to back the overall winner were in 1912 (Theodore Roosevelt won the state on the Bull Moose ticket), 1944, 1968, 2016, and 2024. Hillary Clinton won a plurality, but not majority, of votes in Sandoval county in 2016 due to Gary Johnson (who previously served as Governor of New Mexico) winning an abnormally high number of votes that election. Since 2004, Sandoval County has voted more consistently Democratic in presidential elections, though at narrower margins than nearby Bernalillo County.

Most parts of the city of Rio Rancho vote majority Republican and this is where this party&#x27;s strength lies. Otherwise, the more remote parts of the Jemez Mountains and the town of Cuba trend Republican. However, this is offset by Corrales, Placitas, San Ysidro, and all the Pueblos in the county, as well as many other rural areas which trend Democratic. Cochiti Pueblo in particular is the most Democratic region in the county. Bernalillo has also long been a strongly Democratic region, though in the 2024 election it saw a large shift toward the Republican party, as did the pueblos of Zia and Kewa (Santo Domingo) in particular. Yet the fact that a number of precincts in Corrales and north-central Rio Rancho shifted further toward the left meant that the results of the 2024 election in this county only shifted to the right about 1.2 points from 2020.

==History==
San Miguel County was created in 1846 by the conquering United States&#x27; army in the Mexican-American War. New Mexico became part of the United States in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848. The boundaries of the country often changed until 1923 when its current boundaries were established.

In 1835, prior to the American conquest, the Mexican government had created grants of land in what became San Miguel County. The largest grant in what became San Miguel County was the Las Vegas Grant of (674 sqmi). Most of the grant land was designated as common land to be used by all the grantees and their descendants. The grant lands quickly attracted settlers, mostly Hispanics, to the frontier of New Mexico in a region still menaced by Native American (Indian) raids. The Santa Fe Trail, first travelled in 1821, passed through the county, linking New Mexico to the United States.

The establishment of Fort Union nearby in 1851 increased the security of the region and provided employment for residents and a market for Las Vegas products. The coming of the railroad in 1879 expanded a market for ranch land and stimulated the livestock industry, especially of sheep for wool. The railroad company also harvested much of the timber in the country to make railroad ties. Anglo cattle ranchers moved into the area from Texas. By 1890, a few, mostly Anglo, ranchers controlled one-half of the grazing lands in San Miguel County. Homesteaders also moved into San Miguel County, claiming of land as allowed by the 1862 Homestead Act. Both large ranchers and small homesteaders built homes, barns, and fenced grant land with barbed-wire, ignoring the claims by Hispanic residents of their rights to use the common land for crops, grazing, and timber harvest.

With Hispanic residents losing land and access to irrigation water to speculators, ranchers, and homesteaders, the secretive Gorras Blancas, &quot;White Hats,&quot; burst on the scene in San Miguel County in 1889. The night riding Gorras Blancas destroyed fences and burned barns and other buildings. The Gorras Blancas were successful in gaining public support, eliminating many fences, and preserving access to common lands, but the movement faded in the early 1890s and the march toward converting common lands into private ownership soon resumed. By 2004, of the original land of the Las Vegas grant, only remained in common ownership.

==Politics==
The county has consistently voted for the Republican Party, though Democrats have usually gotten at least 30% of the vote. The only Democratic presidential candidate to win the county since 1936 was Lyndon B. Johnson in his 1964 landslide, who only narrowly won the county by just 93 votes and a margin of victory of less than 1%. San Juan County is the most populous county in New Mexico to lean Republican. The cities of Farmington, Bloomfield, Aztec, and Kirtland all lean strongly Republican, as does the rural area in the north and east of the county. The rural districts to the southwest around Nageezi, which have a high Native American population, saw a Republican trend in the 2024 election and flipped to give Donald Trump a slim majority. The western half of the county including the community of Shiprock, an area which is dominated by the Navajo Nation, votes traditionally Democratic.

<text>Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) was a Spanish aircraft manufacturer that was founded in 1923 and began manufacturing aircraft the following year. In 1999 it became a subsidiary of the EADS (European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company) under the name &quot;EADS CASA&quot; and in 2009 was absorbed into Airbus Military. CASA is noted for designing and producing military transport aircraft such as the CASA C-212 Aviocar, the CASA CN-235, the CASA C-295 and the CASA C-101 trainer/ground attack aircraft.

==History==

Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) was founded by José Ortiz-Echagüe in 1923 and began work on a factory in Getafe in May 1924, building Breguet aircraft under license. The first order covered 26 19 A.2s; total production of this type eventually reached 400 units.

CASA built a second factory in Cadiz in 1926 to construct a licensed copy of the German Dornier Do J Wal seaplane. They built 17 aircraft for the Spanish Air Force, 12 for the Naval Aviation branch of the Spanish Navy and two for commercial use. CASA also operated several branch facilities in Spain for the repair and overhaul of aircraft. In 1929 the CASA-1 flew - the first CASA designed aircraft. King Alfonso XIII visited the main factory in 1930. CASA also built the French Breguet 19, two of which would be made especially famous. One, was the Breguet XIX GR (Grand Raid) named the &quot;Jesus del Gran Poder&quot;, currently preserved in the Museo del Aire de Cuatro Vientos (Madrid), which flew between Seville and Bahia (in Brazil), in 1929. This aircraft was piloted by Captains Ignacio Jiménez and Francisco Iglesias and covered 6746 km in 43 hours 50 minutes. The other was the Breguet XIX Super Bidon, named &quot;Cuatro Vientos&quot; (&quot;Four Winds&quot;); it was flown by Mariano Barberán and Joaquín Collar Serra to Havana in Cuba in 1933. In 1932 CASA obtained a license from the UK aircraft company, Vickers, to build 25 Vickers Vildebeest land-based torpedo bombers, which were powered by French Hispano 600 hp engines.

During the Spanish Civil War, the CASA Getafe factory was located in the Republican zone. It was moved to Alicante, and another opened in Sabadell. At the end of the war, production returned to Getafe. CASA manufactured the Russian Polikarpov I-15 biplane fighter, producing 287 aircraft before the end of the civil war.

After the Spanish Civil War, CASA opened a new plant in Tablada in Seville, after obtaining various aircraft licenses from Germany and built 25 Gotha Go 145A as the CASA 1145, 25 Bücker Bü 133 as the CASA 1133 and 555 Bücker Bü 131 as the CASA 1131. Production of these aircraft continued until the late 1950s. The CASA 201, is a twin-engine transport, (its engines were the Spanish-made ENMASA VAT Tigre G-125). In 1940 CASA began the licensed manufacture of 200 Heinkel He 111 twin-engine bombers with imported Rolls-Royce Merlins, as the CASA 2.111. (These are the aircraft that were used as World War Two German Luftwaffe He 111s in various movies such as &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; and &quot;Patton&quot;.)

Starting in 1943, the Spanish government began investing in CASA, first obtaining a 33 per cent share of the company, by 1992 this had increased to a controlling 99.2 per cent. In 1945 CASA opened a factory in Madrid dedicated to manufacturing the parts and sub-assemblies of their various aircraft and those that they had contracts to repair and overhaul. In 1946 CASA re-established the Projects Office and resumed the design of aircraft based on the firm&#x27;s proprietary technology. In 1957 CASA won a contract from the United States Air Force for the maintenance of the F-100 Super Sabres based in Europe and Turkey and a contract from the Spanish Air Force to overhaul T-33s in the Spanish Air Force. They began the manufacture of the Northrop F-5A fighter-bomber under license in 1962. In 1971, CASA merged with Hispano Aviación.

CASA was one of the original members of the Airbus Consortium with France, Germany and the United Kingdom in 1972. In 1977, CASA was awarded the contract to design and build the C-101, a trainer and attack aircraft for the Spanish Air Force. CASA joined the Eurofighter 2000 project in 1996.

CASA has been a part of EADS, the European aerospace corporation, with Aérospatiale-Matra of France, Dornier GmbH and DASA of Germany since 1999. From then, the Spanish branch of EADS is called EADS-CASA. The current CEO and Chairman of EADS-CASA is Domingo Ureña-Raso. EADS-CASA currently employs around 7,500 workers.
EADS was formed in July, 2000 following the merger of Aerospatiale Matra of France, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace of Germany and Construcciones Aeronáuticas S.A. from Spain. It is the third largest aerospace company in the world with approximately 100,000 employees.

In July 2001 EADS-CASA Military Aircraft marked the beginning of the Eurofighter Typhoon Final Assembly Phase at Getafe. It is one of four assembly lines for the Eurofighter (the other three are at Warton in the United Kingdom, Manching in Germany and Turin in Italy). Production was expected to be up to seven Typhoon wings per month and 12 aircraft per year. EADS CASA is producing the right wing for the Eurofighter and assembling 87 aircraft for the Spanish Air Force. First delivery was realized together with the other partner air forces in the second half of 2002.

===Military Transport Aircraft Division===
EADS CASA&#x27;s Military Transport Aircraft Division (MTAD) was based in Madrid. One of the aircraft it produces is the Airbus A330-200, which has been modified to provide air-to-air refuelling. It has provided one variant to the Royal Australian Air Force and another to the UK&#x27;s Royal Air Force via the &quot;AirTanker&quot; company. MTAD&#x27;s main focus is in the light to medium end of the military transport market covering three to nine tonnes.

The MTAD managed the industrial and technical activities of participating companies for the A400M project. This responsibility is now managed by Airbus Military.

==Government and politics==
The Roosevelt County clerk and deputy clerk resigned in late 2013 after the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled that all counties in the state must license same-sex marriages. County Manager Bill Cathey said they had resolved to quit &quot;rather than be associated with that,&quot; according to the Associated Press.

Roosevelt County is heavily Republican. It has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. However, the county is located in the New Mexico&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, represented by Democrat Teresa Leger Fernandez.

<text>Otero County () is a county located in the U.S. state of New Mexico. As of the 2020 census, the population was 67,839. Its county seat is Alamogordo. Its southern boundary is the Texas state line. It is named for Miguel Antonio Otero, the territorial governor when the county was created.

Otero County includes the Alamogordo Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The western part of Otero County was handed over to the United States Army as the US was preparing to enter World War II and eventually became part of White Sands Missile Range. This did not significantly hinder the growth of the county, whose population more than doubled in the 1950s.

The county declared a state of emergency in April 2019 when the federal inspection stations on U.S. Route 70 and U.S. Route 54 were left unstaffed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection as part of the temporary closure of all six checkpoints in the El Paso Sector, which covers West Texas and New Mexico. The county was concerned about the possibility of illegal narcotics flowing north unchecked since the checkpoint agents had been shifted to the border to help process migrant asylum-seekers. The inspection stations reopened August 5, 2019.

On Monday June 13, 2022, the county commissioners attracted nationwide attention by refusing to certify the results of the local 2022 primary election on June 7, 2022. In response, the New Mexico Secretary of State filed a lawsuit and writ of mandamus against the commissioners for their refusal. By Friday June 17, 2022, two of the three commissioners agreed to certify the election results, which defused the crisis.

==Geography==

<doc id="93400" wikidata="Q487236" url="?curid=93400" title="Mora County, New Mexico">
<text>Mora County () is a county in the U.S. state of New Mexico. As of the 2020 census, its population was 4,189. Its county seat is the census-designated place (CDP) Mora. The county has another CDP, Watrous, a village, Wagon Mound, and 12 smaller unincorporated settlements. Mora became a formal county in the US, in what was then the New Mexico Territory, on February 1, 1860. Ecclesiastically, the county is within the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santa Fe. County population peaked at about 14,000 &quot;circa&quot; 1920, declining to about 4,000 to 5,000 since the 1970s; the 2018 estimate was 4,506.

==History==

Prior to Spanish conquest, the Mora area was Native American country. Although not an area of heavy settlement by stationary tribes such as the Puebloans, the Mora Valley was often used by nomadic nations, including the Ute, Navajo, and Apache.

===Spanish period===
Hispano settlers had occupied lands within the Mora Valley without legal title since Governor Juan Bautista de Anza of Nuevo México (then under the authority of the Spanish Empire) made peace with the Comanches in the late 18th century, opening up the east side of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains for settlement. The Mora Valley then became a travel way for various Spanish explorers and others. It was not permanently inhabited by colonists until the early 19th century. The written history of the settlement of Mora dates to Christian missionary church building in 1818, three years before Mexican independence from Spain.

===Mexican period, and permanent settlement===
The creation of the Mora Land Grant by the Mexican government of New Mexico in 1835 began the legal and extensive settlement of the county. The settlers came primarily from Las Trampas, but also from Picuris and Embudo, then from Santa Cruz de La Cañada, Taos, and the Ojo Caliente area, and later still from the southern part of New Mexico, moving on from the San Miguel del Vado Land Grant, and also coming in via Las Vegas, New Mexico. The families each received a strip of property by a September 28, 1835, land grant of Centralist Republic of Mexico Governor of New Mexico Albino Pérez. The grant gave land title for over 800,000 acres (1,250 square miles; around 323,800 hectares, or 3,200 km2) in Mora Valley to various families willing to relocate; estimates vary from 25 to 76 families.

===Texan and Mexican–American War periods===
When the Republic of Texas seceded from Mexico on March 2, 1836, it claimed, but did not actually control eastern New Mexico, including what is now Mora County. The town of Mora was raided unsuccessfully in 1843 by a group of freebooters from the more narrowly defined Republic of Texas, on the pretext of stopping cattle rustling, but with a clear intent of horse theft and taking the local women and children as slaves. The annexation of Texas by the United States on February 19, 1846, and US General Stephen W. Kearny&#x27;s taking of Santa Fe, New Mexico, in August of that year, made these lands subject to American control under the Kearny Code and the US provisional government of New Mexico, but the area remained in the minds of many long-term residents part of the Republic of Mexico under President Santa Ana.

During the Mexican–American War, beginning on April 25, 1846, much of New Mexico including Mora County was subject to the military occupation of United States under martial law. During the Taos Revolt of the war, Mexican nationalist Hispano and Puebloan militia fought the United States Army, repelling a small force in the First Battle of Mora on January 24, 1847, only to endure the village and surrounding ranches, farms, and crops being burned to the ground in the Second Battle of Mora on February 1, effectively ending active rebellion in the area. The provisional government&#x27;s first legislature met on December 6, 1847, beginning American civil government in the region.

=== In the United States ===
The Mexican–American War ended February 3, 1848, with Mora Valley and rest of the region then under formal US control, as the Mexican Cession of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo relinquished all claims by Mexico to lands north of the Rio Grande. Still claimed by state of Texas until the Compromise of 1850, the New Mexico Territory, with smaller boundaries, was formalized on September 9 of that year.

A US Army installation, Fort Union, was built in 1851 in Mora Valley. It encroached on 8 square miles of private lands of the Mora Grant for its entire span of operation, without permission of or compensation to the local land owners. This led to a protracted legal controversy, reaching all the way to the General Land Office, the Secretary of War, and the US Congress; Nevertheless, the nearby fort and its garrison provided a stable source of income to local farmers, and several grist mills were founded in Mora, including a successful one opened in 1855 by regional trader and Taos Revolt US volunteer cavalry veteran Ceran St. Vrain. The US county of Mora was established in the territory on February 1, 1860. A church was built in the Mora Valley village of Chacon in 1864, reflecting additional settlement into the area. The Mora Grant / Fort Union land dispute was exacerbated in 1868 by an order of President Andrew Johnson that established a government timber reservation that encompassed 53 more square miles the private grant land (the entire Turkey Mountains subrange of the Sangre de Cristos). After being rebuilt twice, the fort eventually closed in 1891, still without restitution to land owners, despite the Kearny Code, Hidalgo Treaty, and other agreements supposedly guaranteeing continuity of Spanish and Mexican land-grant rights.

New Mexico (with reduced land area) became the 47th US state on January 6, 1912, despite concerns in Congress that the population was insufficiently assimilated into American culture, especially after an influx of Mexican refugees from 1910 onward, fleeing the Mexican Revolution. These newcomers mostly settled far south of Mora County, though it remained primarily Spanish-speaking, as it was still largely populated by the same, now-expanded, families who had settled the area three-quarters of a century earlier). On February 21, 1916, Special Master William E. Gortner sold off unallotted common lands of the Mora Grant to the State Investment Company and Edward B. Wheeler in an auction at the door of the San Miguel County Courthouse. Without access to the grazing and timbering lands, many residents sought work outside Mora.

In April 2013, Mora County became the first county in the United States to ban oil and gas drilling on public and private lands.

The modern county seat, Mora, is a census-designated place, and consists of four neighboring settlements and three plazas.

==Education==

Locally controlled public schools in most of McKinley County are run by Gallup-McKinley County Schools, the local school district, and include Crownpoint High School, Gallup Central High School, Gallup High School, Hiroshi Miyamura High School, Navajo Pine High School, Ramah Middle / High School, Thoreau High School, Tohatchi High School, and Tse Yi Gai High School. Areas in and around the Zuni reservation are in the Zuni Public School District, which operates Zuni High School.

Two Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) boarding schools are in the Fort Wingate area: Wingate Elementary School, and Wingate High School. The BIE also operates a K-8 school, Pueblo Pintado Community School, in Pueblo Pintado, and a K-6 school, Baca /Dlo&#x27;Ay Azhi Community School. Additionally, a tribal school affiliated with the BIE, Ch&#x27;ooshgai Community School, is located in Tohatchi.

==Politics==
During its early history from 1912 to 1928, McKinley County voted for the Republican candidate in every presidential election. From 1932 onward, the county, with its large Native American majority, has strongly backed Democratic candidates in all but three presidential elections that were national landslides for the Republican Party.

Democratic strength in the county lies in most of Gallup and the Navajo and Zuni Reservations, which cover a large majority of the county&#x27;s land area. The community of Ramah has previously been one of the only Republican-leaning parts of the county. In 2024 the county saw the strongest shift toward the Republican party of any county in New Mexico, along with Guadalupe, Mora, and Rio Arriba Counties. Parts of southern Gallup and the Thoreau area flipped to a Republican majority, and many parts of the Navajo and Zuni Reservations experienced shifts as well along with most other rural areas.

<doc id="93403" wikidata="Q489652" url="?curid=93403" title="Luna County, New Mexico">
<text>Luna County (Spanish: ) is a county located in the U.S. state of New Mexico. As of the 2020 census, the population was 25,427. Its county seat is Deming. This county abuts the Mexican border. Luna County comprises the Deming, NM Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Luna County was formed from parts of Grant County and Doña Ana County by the New Mexico Legislature on March 16, 1901. It was named for Solomon Luna, a politician who advocated for independence of the county, following a strong rivalry between the cities of Deming and Silver City, both of which were at the time in Grant County.

Before dawn on March 16, 1916, Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa led several hundred of his rebel soldiers across the Mexican border into the village of Columbus in the southern part of the county. The invaders raided and burned much of the town, causing many residents to flee to the desert. Although the raid took the town by surprise, it also awakened 350 United States Army soldiers stationed at Camp Furlong at the edge of town. These soldiers defended Columbus with two machine guns. The fighting continued until dawn, when Villa fled back across the Mexican border, five hours after the initial invasion and approximately ninety minutes after attacking the town. Despite the U.S. Army&#x27;s subsequent &quot;Mexican Expedition&quot; into Mexico, Villa was never captured. The United States&#x27; involvement in World War I soon diverted attention away from the pursuit of Villa. He was assassinated seven years later. The raid resulted in the deaths of eighteen Columbus residents and U.S. soldiers, while approximately seventy-five of Villa&#x27;s soldiers were killed.

In 1917 striking copper miners from Bisbee, Arizona were forcibly deported to this county.

Construction of an improved barrier on the border with Mexico was expedited in 2019 with waivers of environmental and other laws. The waivers are for 27 laws including protection of endangered species, archaeological sites, and historic places.

Today, Pancho Villa State Park is located in the village of Columbus. It features cacti and the ruins of &quot;the U.S. Army&#x27;s first greaserack&quot;.

==Quality of life==
In a study conducted by American City Business Journals in 2004, Los Alamos County topped the list as the best place to live in the United States in terms of quality of life. This was attributed to the high levels of job stability, income and education of Los Alamos residents, many of whom are employed as scientists and engineers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The county has one of the highest number of PhDs per capita and the 2011 median household income of $110,204 per year is the second highest among all the counties in the U.S. In per capita income, Los Alamos County ranks 1st in New Mexico and 7th in the United States, and has the second-lowest level of poverty in the United States, and the lowest level of child poverty. Other factors contributing to Los Alamos&#x27;s high quality-of-life index were the access to affordable housing and short commuting times.

In 2021, Los Alamos County was judged by the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; to be the healthiest of 3,143 counties and county-equivalents of the United States based on 84 different factors. Residents of the county lived 83.4 years on the average compared to the U.S. average of 77.5 years.

==Communities==
* Los Alamos (county seat)
* White Rock

==Education==
All of the county is in the boundary of Los Alamos Public Schools. Los Alamos High School is the comprehensive high school.

== Energy ==

=== Current energy resources ===
Starting in 1985, Los Alamos County, including both the White Rock and Los Alamos communities, has shared energy resources with the Los Alamos National Laboratory. 
=== Future energy resources ===
Both Los Alamos County and the Los Alamos National Laboratory are trying to reduce their respective carbon emissions in order to help mitigate the continually worsening dangers of climate change. In 2015, Los Alamos County joined with the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems in the Carbon Free Power Project. The Project planned to use NuScale Power’s Small Module Reactor design to provide nuclear energy to counties across the United States, but was cancelled in 2023 because of cost increases. Los Alamos’ history is tied to nuclear energy, which has an environmental impact comparable to that of renewables as a source of domestic power. This is true of both large and small module reactors.

==Politics==
Formerly solidly Republican, Los Alamos County has voted Democratic since 2008. In 2024, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris won the highest percentage of the vote in the county since 1964.

It has seen high percentages of third-party votes in years with major third-party candidates, such as with John B. Anderson in 1980, Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996, and Gary Johnson in 2012 and 2016. Los Alamos County had the highest percentage of support for Gary Johnson in New Mexico in the 2016 election, at 13.89% (a total of 1,512 votes out of 10,885 cast).

<text>Lincoln County is a county in the U.S. state of New Mexico. As of the 2020 census, the population was 20,269. Its county seat is Carrizozo, while its largest community is Ruidoso.

==History==

Lincoln County was named in honor of President Abraham Lincoln. It was once the largest county in the United States. In the late 1870s, the Lincoln County War began between ranchers and the owners of the county&#x27;s largest general store. William Bonney, better known as Billy the Kid, became involved on the side of the ranchers after his friend and employer was killed. In the end, Bonney killed the county sheriff, a deputy, and the deputy that killed his friend. Several other people were slain in the conflict, which included the other leader of the rancher faction. His death ended the conflict. In 1878, the new territorial governor, retired Union General Lew Wallace, offered amnesty to the combatants to bring a long-lasting truce between the factions.

Most of the population is in the Greater Ruidoso Area. The town of Carrizozo serves as the county seat and is in the Tularosa Basin northwest of Ruidoso. Ruidoso boasts several small suburbs and neighbor communities including Ruidoso Downs, Hollywood, Mescalero, and Alto which contribute to the Ruidoso Micropolitan Statistical Area&#x27;s population of 21,224. Ruidoso serves as the second largest city in south central New Mexico behind Alamogordo which is 46 miles southwest of the village. Ruidoso Downs on the southern end of the county and southeast of Ruidoso operates the Ruidoso Downs Racetrack and Casino. The track hosts both thoroughbred and quarter horse racing, notably the All American Futurity, the richest in quarter horse racing. Historical figures from Lincoln County include Billy the Kid and Smokey Bear, whose names help drive the tourism trade that is heavily popularized within the county.

==Politics==
Lea County, like most of the High Plains, eastern New Mexico and west-central Texas, is Republican. It has repeatedly claimed the status of the most Republican county in New Mexico in Presidential elections. In the 2004 Presidential election, Lea County was the top New Mexico county, as far as percentage, for Republican George W. Bush. He beat John Kerry 79%-20%. In 2008, the Republican candidate John McCain beat Democratic candidate Barack Obama by a wide but slightly smaller margin, 72% to 27%. In 2024, Donald Trump won over 80% of the county&#x27;s vote, while Kamala Harris only received 18.5%, the worst showing for a Democrat in the county&#x27;s history. It was Trump&#x27;s strongest county in New Mexico in the 2024 election. No Democrat has received more than 30% of the county&#x27;s vote since Bill Clinton in 1996.

However, Lea County was a Democratic stronghold prior to 1968, voting Republican only once in Herbert Hoover&#x27;s 1928 landslide.

==Politics==
Hidalgo has historically been a swing county, going for the winner every time since 1928, except for 1968 and 2020, where it went for Hubert Humphrey and Donald Trump respectively. In 2024, Trump broke 60% of the county&#x27;s vote, the first time that a Republican presidential candidate had done this since Nixon&#x27;s 1972 landslide. While the city of Lordsburg tends to lean Democratic, the rest of the county, especially the southern half, is heavily Republican.

<text>Eddy County is a county located in the U.S. state of New Mexico. As of the 2020 census, the population was 62,314. Its county seat and largest city is Carlsbad. The county was created in 1891 and later organized in 1892. It is north of the Texas state line.

Eddy County comprises the Carlsbad-Artesia, NM Micropolitan Statistical Area.

Carlsbad Caverns National Park is located in this county. Eddy County is the location of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant.

==History==
In 1866, Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving drove vast herds of cattle along the Pecos and set up &quot;cow camps&quot; in Seven Rivers and what is now Carlsbad. John Chisum soon joined them and brought an estimated 100,000 head of cattle of his own through the Pecos Valley.

In 1881, Charles B. Eddy came to the area, and with his brother, John, and partner Amos Bissell, developed the Eddy-Bissell Cattle Company. In 1884, the Eddy brothers and Bissell broke ground on the Halagueno Ranch which encompassed an area from Seven Rivers to La Huerta (a suburb of Carlsbad). In 1887, Eddy built the Halagueno diversion ditch on the Pecos, three miles above the site of the Avalon Dam (which was completed in 1890) and incorporated the venture, calling it the Pecos Valley Land and Ditch Company. Eddy was looking to entice Europeans to settle the area, and with the new Halagueno Ranch and the Pecos Valley Land and Ditch Company established, he sought funds from a Swiss bank to help attract them to the clean air and sunny climate.

In 1888, Patrick Garrett (known as the sheriff who had shot Billy the Kid) along with promoter Charles Greene, joined forces with Eddy to design and build a system of canals and flumes to divert water to their ranches and properties. Greene was able to procure investors from the east, one of which was Robert W. Tansill (manufacturer of the &quot;Punch 5 ¢ Cigar&quot;). These men, along with another big investor, J.J. Hagerman, laid the plans for a new town on the west bank of the Pecos River. The men had the town incorporated as Eddy on September 15, 1888.

The county was named for cattle rancher Charles B. Eddy. When the territorial legislature set the boundaries of Eddy County, in 1889, Seven Rivers was named the county seat. During an election in 1890 for new county commissioners, a referendum was on the ballot to change the seat from Seven Rivers to the town of Eddy. The referendum passed by a vote of 331 to 83. In that year, the census said Eddy had only 278 people and they cast 241 of the winning votes. The referendum also included the building of a courthouse. Charles Eddy donated the land which consisted of an entire town block. The county commissioners authorized a contract for $30,000 to build a brick courthouse. (In 1899, the town of Eddy changed its name to Carlsbad.)

On January 10, 1891, the first railroad train on the new Pecos Valley Railroad arrived in Eddy, from Pecos, Texas. Crops of cotton and alfalfa (which were found to be the perfect crops for the Eddy County area), along with cattle, sheep, wool, and people, could be moved into and out of the area with ease, now. This brought more investors and many more settlers into the area.

In 1902, Carlsbad Caverns were discovered about southwest of Carlsbad town. The discovery is still disputed between Jim White and Abijah Long. The caves are now known as Carlsbad Caverns National Park. The caverns have brought many millions of visitors from around the world into Eddy County.

Oil was discovered in Eddy County in 1909, near the town of Dayton (8 mi south of Artesia). Another big oil strike happened in 1923, when Martin Yates Jr., purchased a well near Artesia, and southeastern New Mexico was said to be &quot;gushing oil!&quot;. Drilling commenced at a furious pace and by 1938, the area&#x27;s oil production was valued at $32 million annually.

In 1925, a geologist, Dr. V. H. McNutt, discovered major deposits of potash, while looking for oil east of Carlsbad. This ushered in a &quot;boom&quot; in potash mining, and several large potash producers set up business in the area.
==Geography==

==Politics==
For much of the first half of the 20th century, Eddy was a Democratic stronghold. Then it became a Republican-leaning swing county until the turn of the century. Since then, it has become a Republican stronghold, like most plains counties. Donald Trump&#x27;s 2020 and 2024 performances here, both of over 75%, are the strongest victories for any Republican in county history.

<doc id="93416" wikidata="Q111979" url="?curid=93416" title="Colfax County, New Mexico">
<text>Colfax County is a county in the U.S. state of New Mexico. As of the 2020 census, the population was 12,387. Its county seat is Raton. It is south from the Colorado state line. This county was named for Schuyler Colfax (18231885), seventeenth Vice President of the United States under U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant.

Colfax County is the home of Philmont Scout Ranch and the NRA Whittington Center.

==History==
Colfax County was originally part of Taos County, one of the original nine counties created by the New Mexico Territory in 1852. In 1859, the eastern part of Taos County, including all of the territory of Colfax County, was split off to form Mora County. Colfax County was established on January 25, 1869, from the northern part of Mora County. The original county seat was the gold mining town of Elizabethtown.

By 1872, when the gold rush in Elizabethtown had died down, the county seat was moved to Cimarron. Cimarron was on the stage coach route along the Mountain Branch of the Santa Fe Trail, and was the headquarters of the Maxwell Land Grant. The Colfax County Courthouse in Cimarron is a contributing structure in the Cimarron Historic District, and is still in use as a Masonic lodge.

In 1881, the county seat moved from Cimarron to Springer, on the former Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad, since 1996 part of the BNSF Railway. The Colfax County Courthouse in Springer was the site of one of the last important shoot-outs in the Colfax County War. This former courthouse, which is on the National Register of Historic Places is now a museum devoted to the Santa Fe Trail.

The eastern portions of Colfax, Mora, and San Miguel counties were severed to form Union County in 1893.

After a referendum and a bitter legislative fight, the county seat moved from Springer to Raton in 1897. Raton was an important coal-mining town, and was also a railroad center. The citizens of Raton raised $8000 to pay one third of the costs of a new courthouse. That courthouse was replaced in 1932 by the current Colfax County Courthouse (Raton, New Mexico), an art-deco WPA structure that also is on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.3%) is water.

A large portion of the County lies in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Geography ranges from prairies, to pinon forests, to alpine meadows.

The County contains numerous state parks, ski resorts, national forests, scenic vistas, and outdoor recreational activities.

All public schools in the county are operated by Grants/Cibola County Schools; the Quemado and Zuni facilities are in other counties.

Due to an agreement between Cibola County and McKinley County, residents of the Ramah Navajo Indian Reservation are bussed to schools in Ramah in McKinley County (including Ramah Middle/High School) even though they are physically in Cibola County, due to the long distance to the nearest Cibola County schools from the reservation.

==Corrections==
Cibola County is home to three prisons:
* the Cibola County Correctional Center, operated by Corrections Corporation of America, housing 1129 federal inmates under a contract with the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the United States Marshal Service

* Western New Mexico Correctional Facility, owned and operated by the state, with about 440 male inmates

In November 2018, following a private autopsy, a unit of the Cibola County Correctional Center (CCCC) was named in the abuse and wrongful death on May 25, 2018, of Roxsana Hernández Rodríguez. Rodríguez was a 33-year-old transgender woman who immigrated from Honduras. The CCCC is operated under contract by CoreCivic.

==Politics==




Cibola County tends to support the Democratic Party. In the 1984 presidential election, a majority voted for the Republican presidential nominee, otherwise since that time (until 2024) all other presidential elections had a Democrat majority. Democratic strength lies especially in the Acoma, Laguna, and Ramah Navajo Reservations. Republican strength lies in Milan, Grants, and surrounding rural areas, as well as the southwestern portion of the county.

In the 2024 election, the county saw a strong trend toward the Republican Party. Kamala Harris was unable to gain a majority in the county, only winning through a narrow plurality of 49.57%. This was due in part to the cities of Grants and Milan, which trended more Republican than in 2020, with every precinct giving Trump the majority (unlike in 2020, when much of central Grants voted majority Democratic). With the exception of the rural areas to the northeast and the northwest of Grants, the rest of the county also saw Republican trends, including the areas with highly Native American populations. This was the closest that any Republican presidential candidate has come to flipping the county since Reagan&#x27;s time.

At the state level, the only time it has voted for a Republican nominee for Governor was 2014, when Susana Martinez carried all but five counties in her reelection bid.

In the 16th century, Spanish explorers and colonists came to the region, declaring it in 1598 to be part of Santa Fé de Nuevo México, a province of New Spain in the Americas. The province remained in Spanish control until Mexico gained independence in 1821. Under the 1824 Constitution of Mexico, this became the federally administered Territory of New Mexico.

Mexico ceded the region to the U.S. in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 after being defeated in the Mexican–American War. In 1849, President Zachary Taylor proposed that New Mexico, including this region, immediately be admitted as a state in order to sidestep political conflict over the expansion of slavery in the territories. That did not happen. European-American settlers from the southern and eastern states began to arrive here, including some with enslaved African Americans. The territory did not become a state until 1912, long after the Civil War and abolition of slavery.

In 1880, Sergeant James C. Cooney was the first person to find silver and gold ore in the mountains of Catron County. He was reportedly killed by Chiricahua Apache led by Victorio that year, in what the European Americans called the &quot;Alma Massacre&quot;. His remains are buried at Cooney&#x27;s Tomb.

The foothills and canyons provided many hiding places for Apache warriors as they continued to resist American encroachment. During this time Cochise was another well-known Chiricahua leader. Noted war chief Goyaałé (Geronimo) had several hideouts in the county. Later in 1880, Buffalo Soldiers led by Sergeant George Jordan defeated Chiricahua Apache warriors led by Victorio in the Battle of Fort Tularosa. Four years later, self-appointed sheriff Elfego Baca was the hero of the so-called Frisco shootout in San Francisco Plaza.

The country also attracted European-American outlaws. In the mid-1880s Butch Cassidy and his Wild Bunch gang holed up at a ranch near Alma. Notorious outlaw Tom Ketchum also lived in Catron County around this time.

Socorro County included all of Catron County&#x27;s territory from the creation of Santa Fé de Nuevo México until 1921. At that time, Catron County was organized and named for Thomas B. Catron, a leading figure in New Mexico statehood and its first US senator. In 1927, the State Legislature attempted to abolish both Socorro and Catron in order to create a new Rio Grande County. A court suit voided this act, and the two counties retained their independence.

The Lightning Field, an art installation on the open earth, brought national attention to Quemado in this county in the late 1970s.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.08%) is water.

Catron County is the largest county, by area, in New Mexico. At almost , Catron County is larger than four states. With a population of only 3,400 people, the county is as sparsely populated as many an old West frontier area. The elk population at some 12,000 head, is much larger than the sparse human population.

Within the boundaries of Catron County lie parts of the Gila National Forest, the Apache National Forest and the Cibola National Forest. The establishment of these national forests, in the past called &quot;forest reserves,&quot; led to the name Reserve being given to a village on the San Francisco River, which also serves as the County Seat. There are no stop lights in the whole county, so when license tests are given in Reserve, an artificial portable stop light is set up in a parking lot.

Bordering Arizona, Catron County affords the shortest route between Albuquerque and Phoenix or Tucson. Reserve can also be reached by following U.S. Route 180 north from Silver City and New Mexico State Road 12 east for a total of .

In Catron County there is a volcanic area that until recently contained sufficient heat to cause steam to rise after a slight rain. It is called Burning Mountain and appears to have been used by the Apache for healing purposes. The county is home to the Red Hill Volcanic Field as well as the Plains of San Agustin.

<text>Bernalillo County (; ) is the most populous county in the U.S. state of New Mexico. As of the 2020 census, the population was 676,444. The county seat, Albuquerque, is the most populous city in New Mexico.

Bernalillo County is the central county of the Albuquerque, NM Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Bernalillo County was one of seven &quot;partidos&quot; established during Mexican rule; in 1852, within two years of the creation of the New Mexico Territory, Bernalillo became one of that territory&#x27;s nine original counties. Bernalillo County was named for the town of Bernalillo, which is currently no longer part of the county. The towns of Los Ranchos de Albuquerque and Bernalillo were previously the county seats, but the capital was finally established in Albuquerque in 1883. In 1876, it absorbed Santa Ana County.

In 1906, years after the Land Revision Act of 1891 provided for the setting aside of forest reserves, the parts of Bernalillo County currently known as Cibola National Forest were established as reserves.

USS &quot;LST-306&quot;, a World War II tank landing ship that participated in the Allied invasion of Italy, was renamed as USS &quot;Bernalillo County&quot; in 1955. Sandia Mountain Wilderness was created in 1978 and the Petroglyph National Monument was established in June 1990.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water. It is the third-smallest county in New Mexico by area.

==Politics==

===County Commission===

===County offices===
===New Mexico Senate===
===Congressional===
Melanie Stansbury (D) is the representative for the 1st Congressional District.

Gabe Vasquez (D) is the representative for the 2nd Congressional District.

===Presidential===
In presidential elections prior to 1992, Bernalillo County primarily voted for Republican Party candidates, only supporting three Democratic candidates in six elections total. (Franklin D. Roosevelt four times, Harry S. Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson once each). From 1992 on, the county has backed Democratic Party candidates in every presidential election. While the margins were relatively narrow from 1992 to 2004, since then the county has tilted strongly Democratic similar to many urban counties nationwide.
The region around Nob Hill and Downtown, which includes the University of New Mexico, is where the greatest Democratic strength in the county lies, with parts of the North Valley near the river also contributing. The Isleta Reservation in the southern strip of the county is also a highly Democratic region. The heavily Hispanic South Valley, as well as Atrisco and Armijo, which have long been Democratic strongholds, have been recently trending heavily toward the Republican party, with several precincts flipping in the 2024 election. Republican strength in the county lies east of Tijeras, in parts of the southeast near Kirtland Air Force Base, and for a long time in much of the Northeast Heights region, although this area showed a Democratic trend in the 2024 election.











==Communities==
A local toponymic oddity is that the town of Bernalillo, north of Albuquerque, is not actually in Bernalillo County. When established in 1852, the county was named for the town of Bernalillo, which was incorporated into Sandoval County in 1903.

<doc id="93422" wikidata="Q502468" url="?curid=93422" title="Warren County, New Jersey">
<text>Warren County is a county located in the U.S. state of New Jersey. According to the 2020 census, the county was the state&#x27;s 19th-most populous county, with a population of 109,632, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 940 (+0.9%) from the 2010 census count of 108,692, which in turn reflected an increase of 6,255 (+6.1%) from 102,437 counted at the 2000 census. The county is part of the North Jersey region of the state.

The county borders the Delaware River and Easton, Pennsylvania in the Lehigh Valley to its west, the New York City metropolitan area to its east, the Poconos to its northwest, and Hunterdon County to its south. 

Warren County constitutes part of the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ metropolitan statistical area in the Lehigh Valley and is the only New Jersey county not a part of the combined statistical areas of either New York City or Philadelphia. The county&#x27;s most populous municipality is Phillipsburg, with 15,249 residents at the time of the 2020 census while Hardwick Township had both the largest area, , and the fewest people with 1,696 residents. Its county seat is Belvidere.

Warren County was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on November 20, 1824, from portions of Sussex County. At its establishment, the county consisted of the townships of Greenwich, Independence, Knowlton, Mansfield, Oxford, and the now defunct Pahaquarry. 

Warren County is named for Joseph Warren, a patriot during the American Revolution and Founding Father of the United States who was killed in action by British troops at the Battle of Bunker Hill, in Charlestown, Massachusetts on June 17, 1775.

==History==

===Etymology===
The county was named for Joseph Warren, a physician, Founding Father of the United States, and major general in the American Revolutionary War who died after volunteering to fight as a private at the Battle of Bunker Hill.

===Native Americans===

About 1000 B.C., clay pottery was beginning to be used in the region, representing the beginning of the Woodland period. With this advancement in technology, Native Americans could store food and cook it better.

Various cultures of indigenous peoples occupied the area at that time. Ancestors of the Algonquian-speaking Lenape moved into the area, perhaps as early as 1000 A.D. from the Mississippi River area.

Technological innovations occurred around the year 500 A.D. with the invention of the bow and arrow as projectile points became smaller to fit onto an arrow shaft. This permitted Native Americans to procure more food since they could be further away from game to kill it. Food such as nuts could be stored in clay pots or the pots were used for cooking

Agriculture started around that time with the cultivation of corn, beans, and squash. Seeds were probably procured from traveling groups or tribes. Settlements of family groups became more stable, as they could store food in pottery, as well as procure more game with the bow and arrow. Agriculture contributed to the rise of population density in areas where crops could be grown. The Lenape would tend their oval gardens during the spring and summer months. They fished with nets or by hand in the shallow rivers. The Lenape trapped game with deadfalls and snares.

===17th century===

Problems developed in the early 17th century when the Little Ice Age began in North America. The late frost in May and June and early frosts in August or September, made the growing of crops difficult. Cold weather also made big and small game more difficult to hurt, as some game animals would hibernate. Also nut crops from oak, hickory, beech, walnut, butternut, and chestnut, failed at times; making the supply of these nuts scarce. Rivers froze early, and water became cold fast; so fishing became impossible. The Native populations had declined after epidemics of infectious diseases, for which they had no acquired immunity. 

Native American populations were separated from Europe for thousands of years and had no immunity to these diseases that the Europeans brought with them. Many Native American populations were weakened from starvation due to the Little Ice Age, which was coldest during the 17th century. Their important corn, bean and squash crops failed due to spring frosts and early frosts in autumn. As the Native American population declined, more land was available for European settlement. All these factors made the Native American populations decline dramatically. 
Europeans purchased land known as land patents so Native Americans moved west to Ohio or Canada. The Dutch settled the Hudson River Valley and claimed all lands west of the Hudson River in the early 17th century. In the Quintipartite Deed of 1674 to 1702, the Province of New Jersey was divided by two lines, the Keith Line and the Coxe-Barclay line, which created the border of eastern Sussex county from the headwaters of the Pequannock River. The western border was the Delaware River.

Later, after the lands were taken over by the British, colonial-era New Jersey was divided into two parts, East Jersey and West Jersey. In the 17th century, the area of present-day Warren County was part of Burlington County, which emerged as one of the Thirteen Colonies in British America prior to the mid-18th century American Revolution.

===18th century===

The area became Hunterdon County in 1714. In 1739, the area of Warren County was included in Morris County. In 1753, Sussex County, including present-day Warren County, separated from Morris County.

During the French and Indian War of 1754, fortified homes or small forts were built along the Delaware River from Phillipsburg to Port Jervis, New York. The mountains of Warren County were the frontier of the war. Hostilities between the British and the French began to spill over from the European continent into the colonies in the New World. After the Battle of Jumonville Glen in Fayette County, Pennsylvania on May 28, 1754, French colonists in North America armed several Native American tribes, who sided with the French.

During the French and Indian War, a part of the Seven Years&#x27; War in North America, Sussex County often was raided by bands of Native Americans, including Lenape, Shawnee, and Iroquois. In 1756, a small band of Lenape raided the homes of local militia commanders, killing several members of the Swartout family and kidnapping other settlers during the Hunt-Swartout raid. In response to these aggressions, Jonathan Belcher, the colonial-era governor of the Province of New Jersey authorized that eight forts to be constructed along the Delaware River to defend the New Jersey frontier from such incursions, and authorized the New Jersey Frontier Guard to man them. Several of these forts were little more than blockhouses, and others were personal homes that were fortified. The forts sprawled from present-day Phillipsburg through Belvidere. Blairstown, and along the eastern banks of the Delaware River to Port Jervis, New York.

===19th century===
By the early 1800s, settlements in Phillipsburg, Hackettstown, Belvidere, and Washington in Warren County emerged as cornerstone communities of Sussex County. In 1824, Warren County was established and Belvidere was named as its county seat.

==Geography and climate==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of the 2020 census, the county had a total area of , of which was land (98.3%) and was water (1.7%). Warren County has rolling hills with the Kittatinny Ridge in the west. Allamuchy Mountain and Jenny Jump Mountain are part of the New York – New Jersey Highlands, also known as the Reading Prong. Around 450 million years ago, a chain of volcanic islands collided with proto North America. The chain of islands went over the North American Plate, creating the Highlands from the island rock and establishing the Great Appalachian Valley. The final collision was when the African Plate collided with the North American plate. That was the final episode of the building of the Appalachian Mountains. Then the African plate tore away from North America.

The Wisconsin Glacier covered the northern part of the county from 21,000 to 13,000 BC. The glacier covered the top of Kittatinny Mountain and carved the terrain in the northern part of the county. The terminal moraine runs from north of Belvidere to the south of Great Meadows to north of Hackettstown, to the north of Budd Lake. Blairstown Township, Hope Township, half of Independence Township, part of White Township, and all of Allamuchy Township was covered by the Glacier. When the glacier melted, a lake was formed at Great Meadows. Slowly the lake drained leaving a large flat area filled with organic material.

The county is drained by three rivers. All three rivers are shallow and narrow. They are fresh water rivers that are excellent for fishing. 
The Paulins Kill drains the western portion of the county. The river flows from Newton to Blairstown Township, and then through Knowlton Township where it drains into the Delaware River. The Pequest River drains the middle of the county flowing from Andover Township through Allamuchy, then to Independence Township where it turns west and flows through White Township and then empties into the Delaware River at Belvidere. The third river is the Musconetcong. Starting at Lake Musconetcong, the river divides the county from Morris and Hunterdon. This river drains the southern portion of the county and empties into the Delaware River near Warren Glen.

Warren County is located in two valleys of the Great Appalachian Valley. The first is the Kittatinny Valley, which is in the northern part of the county, and the Lehigh Valley, which borders the southern part of the county.

The Lehigh Valley starts at the terminal moraine of the Wisconsin Glacier slightly north of Belvidere. It extends from the Delaware River south to where the Musconetcong River enters the Delaware River, northeast to the Jenny Jump Mountains and then along Route 80 to the Allamuchy Mountains to the terminal moraine near Hackettstown. The Kittatinny Valley is situated north of the terminal moraine; it runs north of Belvidere, to south of Great Meadows, then east to the north of Hackettstown. Towns such as Blairstown, Johnsonburg, Hope and Allamuchy are in the Kittatinny Valley

The highest elevation is above sea level on the Kittatinny Ridge, at two areas just south of Upper Yards Creek Reservoir, west of Blairstown. The lowest point is the confluence of the Delaware and Musconetcong rivers at the county&#x27;s southern tip, at of elevation. The highest elevation on Allamuchy Mountain is on the ridge northeast of Allamuchy. On Jenny Jump Mountain the highest point is east of the Shiloh area or south of Interstate 80. Sunfish Pond has an elevation of and upper Yards Creek Reservoir is at .

<text>Asser (; ; died 909) was a Welsh monk from St David&#x27;s, Dyfed, who became Bishop of Sherborne in the 890s. About 885 he was asked by Alfred the Great to leave St David&#x27;s and join the circle of learned men whom Alfred was recruiting for his court. After spending a year at Caerwent because of illness, Asser accepted.

In 893, Asser wrote a biography of Alfred, called the &quot;Life of King Alfred&quot;. The manuscript survived to modern times in only one copy, which was part of the Cotton library. That copy was destroyed in a fire in 1731, but transcriptions that had been made earlier, together with material from Asser&#x27;s work which was included by other early writers, have made it possible to reconstruct the work. The biography is the main source of information about Alfred&#x27;s life and provides far more information about Alfred than is known about any other early English ruler. Asser assisted Alfred in his translation of Gregory the Great&#x27;s &quot;Pastoral Care&quot;, and possibly with other works.

Asser is sometimes cited as a source for the legend about Alfred&#x27;s having founded the University of Oxford, which is now known to be false. A short passage making this claim was interpolated by William Camden into his 1603 edition of Asser&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot;. Doubts have also been raised periodically about whether the entire &quot;Life&quot; is a forgery, written by a slightly later writer, but it is now almost universally accepted as genuine.

==Name and early life==
Asser (also known as John Asser or Asserius Menevensis) was a Welsh monk who lived from at least AD 885 until about 909. Almost nothing is known of Asser&#x27;s early life. The name Asser is likely to have been taken from Aser, or Asher, the eighth son of Jacob in Genesis. Old Testament names were common in Wales at the time, but it has been suggested that this name may have been adopted at the time Asser entered the church. Asser may have been familiar with a work by St Jerome on the meaning of Hebrew names (Jerome&#x27;s given meaning for &quot;Asser&quot; was &quot;blessed&quot;).

According to his &quot;Life of King Alfred&quot;, Asser was a monk at St David&#x27;s in what was then the kingdom of Dyfed, in south-west Wales. Asser makes it clear that he was brought up in the area, and was tonsured, trained and ordained there. He also mentions Nobis, a bishop of St David&#x27;s who died in 873 or 874, as being a kinsman of his.

==Recruitment by Alfred and time at court==
Much of what is known about Asser comes from his biography of Alfred, in particular a short section in which Asser recounts how Alfred recruited him as a scholar for his court. Alfred held a high opinion of the value of learning and recruited men from around Britain and from continental Europe to establish a scholarly centre at his court. It is not known how Alfred heard of Asser, but one possibility relates to Alfred&#x27;s overlordship of south Wales. Several kings, including Hywel ap Rhys of Glywysing and Hyfaidd of Dyfed (where Asser&#x27;s monastery was), had submitted to Alfred&#x27;s overlordship in 885. Asser gives a fairly detailed account of the events. There is a charter of Hywel&#x27;s which has been dated to c. 885; amongst the witnesses is one &quot;Asser&quot;, which may be the same person. Hence it is possible that Alfred&#x27;s relationship with the southern Welsh kings led him to hear of Asser.

Asser recounts meeting Alfred first at the royal estate at Dean, Sussex (now East and West Dean, West Sussex). Asser provides only one datable event in his history: on St Martin&#x27;s Day, 11 November 887, Alfred decided to learn to read Latin. Working backwards from this, it appears most likely that Asser was recruited by Alfred in early 885.

Asser&#x27;s response to Alfred&#x27;s request was to ask for time to consider the offer, as he felt it would be unfair to abandon his current position in favour of worldly recognition. Alfred agreed but also suggested that he should spend half his time at St David&#x27;s and half with Alfred. Asser again asked for time to consider, but ultimately agreed to return to Alfred with an answer in six months. On his return to Wales, however, Asser fell ill with a fever and was confined to the monastery of Caerwent for twelve months and a week. Alfred wrote to find out the cause of the delay, and Asser responded that he would keep his promise when he recovered. When he did recover, in 886, he agreed to divide his time between Wales and Alfred&#x27;s court, as Alfred had suggested. Others at St David&#x27;s supported this, since they hoped Asser&#x27;s influence with Alfred would avoid &quot;damaging afflictions and injuries at the hands of King Hyfaidd (who often assaulted that monastery and the jurisdiction of St David)&quot;.

Asser joined several other noted scholars at Alfred&#x27;s court, including Grimbald, and John the Old Saxon; all three probably reached Alfred&#x27;s court within a year of each other. His first extended stay with Alfred was at the royal estate at Leonaford, probably from about April through December 886. It is not known where Leonaford was; a case has been made for Landford, in Wiltshire. Asser records that he read aloud to the king from the books at hand. On Christmas Eve, 886, after Asser had for some time failed to obtain permission to return to Wales, Alfred gave Asser the monasteries of Congresbury and Banwell, along with a silk cloak and a quantity of incense &quot;weighing as much as a stout man.&quot; He allowed Asser to visit his new possessions and thence to return to St David&#x27;s.

Thereafter Asser seems to have divided his time between Wales and Alfred&#x27;s court. Asser gives no information about his time in Wales, but mentions various places that he visited in England, including the battlefield at Ashdown, Cynuit (Countisbury), and Athelney. It is evident from Asser&#x27;s account that he spent a good deal of time with Alfred: he recounts meeting Alfred&#x27;s mother-in-law, Eadburh (who is not the same Eadburh who died as a beggar in Pavia), on many occasions; and says that he has often seen Alfred hunting.

==Bishop of Sherborne==
Sometime between 887 and 892, Alfred gave Asser the monastery of Exeter. Asser subsequently became Bishop of Sherborne, though the year of succession is unknown. Asser&#x27;s predecessor as Bishop of Sherborne, Wulfsige, attested a charter in 892. Asser&#x27;s first appearance in the position is in 900, when he appears as a witness to a charter; hence the succession can only be dated to the years 892 to 900. In any event, Asser had already been a bishop prior to his appointment to the see of Sherborne, since Wulfsige is known to have received a copy of Alfred&#x27;s &quot;Pastoral Care&quot; in which Asser is described as a bishop.

It is possible that Asser was a suffragan bishop within the see of Sherborne, but he may instead have been a bishop of St David&#x27;s. He is listed as such in Giraldus Cambrensis&#x27;s &quot;Itinerarium Cambriae&quot;, although this may be unreliable as it was written three centuries later, in 1191. A contemporary clue is found in Asser&#x27;s own writing: he mentions that bishops of St David&#x27;s were sometimes expelled by King Hyfaidd and adds that &quot;he even expelled me on occasion.&quot; This also implies that Asser was himself a bishop of St David&#x27;s.

==&quot;The Life of King Alfred&quot;==
In 893, Asser wrote a biography of Alfred entitled &quot;The Life of King Alfred&quot;; in the original Latin, the title is &quot;Vita Ælfredi regis Angul Saxonum&quot;. The date is known from Asser&#x27;s mention of the king&#x27;s age in the text. The work, which is less than twenty thousand words long, is one of the most important sources of information on Alfred the Great.

Asser drew on a variety of texts to write his &quot;Life&quot;. The style is similar to that of two biographies of Louis the Pious: &quot;Vita Hludovici Imperatoris&quot;, written c. 840 by an unknown author usually called &quot;the Astronomer&quot;, and &quot;Vita Hludowici Imperatoris&quot; by Thegan of Trier. It is possible that Asser may have known these works. He also knew Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot;; the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, a Welsh source; the &quot;Life of Alcuin&quot;; and the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. It is also clear from the text that Asser was familiar with Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Caelius Sedulius&#x27;s &quot;Carmen Paschale&quot;, Aldhelm&#x27;s &quot;De Virginitate&quot;, and Einhard&#x27;s &quot;Vita Karoli Magni&quot; (&quot;Life of Charlemagne&quot;). He quotes from Gregory the Great&#x27;s &quot;Regula Pastoralis&quot;, a work he and Alfred subsequently collaborated in translating, and from Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s &quot;Enchiridion&quot;. About half of the &quot;Life&quot; is little more than a translation of part of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; for the years 851–887, though Asser adds personal opinions and interpolates information about Alfred&#x27;s life. Asser also adds material relating to the years after 887 and general opinions about Alfred&#x27;s character and reign.

Asser&#x27;s prose style has been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His frequent use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that is common in Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are peculiar to Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, but it is also possible that he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.

The &quot;Life&quot; ends abruptly with no concluding remarks and it is considered likely that the manuscript is an incomplete draft. Asser lived a further fifteen or sixteen years and Alfred a further six, but no events after 893 are recorded.

It is possible that the work was written principally for the benefit of a Welsh audience. Asser takes pains to explain local geography, so he was clearly considering an audience not familiar with the areas he described. More specifically, at several points he gives an English name and follows it with the British / Welsh equivalent name, such as in the case of Nottingham. As a result, and given that Alfred&#x27;s overlordship of south Wales was recent, it may be that Asser intended the work to acquaint a Welsh readership with Alfred&#x27;s personal qualities and reconcile them to his rule. However, it is also possible that Asser&#x27;s inclusion of Welsh placenames simply reflects an interest in etymology or the existence of a Welsh audience in his own household rather than in Wales. There are also sections such as the support for Alfred&#x27;s programme of fortification that give the impression of the book&#x27;s being aimed at an English audience.

Asser&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; omits any mention of internal strife or dissent in Alfred&#x27;s own reign, though when he mentions that Alfred had to harshly punish those who were slow to obey Alfred&#x27;s commands to fortify the realm, he makes it clear that Alfred did have to enforce obedience. Asser&#x27;s life is a one-sided treatment of Alfred, though since Alfred was alive when it was composed, it is unlikely to contain gross errors of fact.

In addition to being the primary source for Alfred&#x27;s life, Asser&#x27;s work is also a source for other historical periods, where he adds material to his translation of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. For example, he tells a story about Eadburh, the daughter of Offa. Eadburh married Beorhtric, king of the West Saxons. Asser describes her as behaving &quot;like a tyrant&quot; and ultimately accidentally poisoning Beorhtric in an attempt to murder someone else. He finishes by describing her death as a beggar in Pavia. 

==Manuscripts of &quot;The Life of King Alfred&quot;==
The early manuscript of the &quot;Life&quot; does not appear to have been widely known in medieval times. Only one copy is known to have survived into modern times. It is known as Cotton MS Otho A xii, and was part of the Cotton library. It was written about 1000 and was destroyed in a fire in 1731. The lack of distribution may be because Asser had not finished the manuscript and so did not have it copied. However, the material in the &quot;Life&quot; is recognizable in other works. There is some evidence from early writers of access to versions of Asser&#x27;s work, as follows:
* Byrhtferth of Ramsey included large sections of it into &quot;Historia Regum&quot;, a historical work he wrote in the late tenth or early 11th century. He may have used the Cotton manuscript. (The &quot;Historia Regum&quot; was until recently attributed to Symeon of Durham.)
* The anonymous author of the &quot;Encomium Emmae Reginae&quot; (written in the early 1040s) was apparently acquainted with the &quot;Life&quot;, though it is not known how he knew of it. The author was a monk of St Bertin&#x27;s in Flanders, but may have learned of the work in England.
* The chronicler known as Florence of Worcester incorporated parts of Asser&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; into his chronicle, in the early 12th century; again, he may have also used the Cotton manuscript.
* An anonymous chronicler at Bury St Edmunds, working in the second quarter of the 12th century, produced a compilation now known as &quot;The Annals of St Neots&quot;. He used material from a version of Asser&#x27;s work which differs in some places from the Cotton manuscript and in some places appears to be more accurate, so it is possible that the copy used was not the Cotton manuscript.
* Giraldus Cambrensis wrote a &quot;Life of St Æthelberht&quot;, probably at Hereford during the 1190s. He quotes an incident from Asser that occurred during the reign of Offa of Mercia, who died in 796. This incident is not in the surviving copies of the manuscript. It is possible that Giraldus had access to a different copy of Asser&#x27;s work. It is also possible that he is quoting a different work by Asser, which is otherwise unknown, or even that Giraldus is making up the reference to Asser to support his story. The latter is at least plausible, since Giraldus is not always regarded as a trustworthy writer.

The history of the Cotton manuscript itself is quite complex. The list of early writers above mentions that it may have been in the possession of at least two of them. It was owned by John Leland, the antiquary, in the 1540s. It probably became available after the dissolution of the monasteries, in which the property of many religious houses was confiscated and sold. Leland died in 1552 and it is known to have been in the possession of Matthew Parker from some time after that until his own death in 1575. Although Parker bequeathed most of his library to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, the Cotton manuscript was not included. By 1600, it was in the library of Lord Lumley and by 1621 the manuscript was in the possession of Robert Cotton. The Cotton library was moved in 1712 from Cotton House in Westminster to Essex House in the Strand and then moved again in 1730 to Ashburnham House in Westminster. On the morning of Saturday, 23 October 1731, a fire broke out and the Cotton manuscript was destroyed.

As a result, the text of Asser&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; is known from a multitude of different sources. Various transcripts had been made of the Cotton manuscript and a facsimile of the first page of the manuscript had been made and published, giving more direct evidence for the hand of the scribe. In addition to these transcripts, the extracts mentioned above made by other early writers have been used to help assemble and assess the text. Because of the lack of the manuscript itself and because Parker&#x27;s annotations had been copied by some transcribers as if they were part of the text, scholarly editions have had a difficult burden. There have been multiple editions of &quot;The Life&quot; published, both in Latin and in translation. The 1904 critical edition (with 130 pages of introduction) by W. H. Stevenson, &quot;Asser&#x27;s Life of King Alfred, together with the Annals of Saint Neots erroneously ascribed to Asser&quot;, still provides the standard Latin text: this was translated into English in 1905 by Albert S. Cook. An important recent translation, with thorough notes on the scholarly problems and issues, is &quot;Alfred the Great: Asser&#x27;s Life of King Alfred and Other Contemporary Sources&quot; by Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge.

==Legend of founding of Oxford==
In 1603 the antiquarian William Camden published an edition of Asser&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; in which there appears a story of a community of scholars at Oxford, who were visited by Grimbald:
In the year of our Lord 886, the second year of the arrival of St Grimbald in England, the University of Oxford was begun ... John, monk of the church of St David, giving lectures in logic, music and arithmetic; and John, the monk, colleague of St Grimbald, a man of great parts and a universal scholar, teaching geometry and astronomy before the most glorious and invincible King Alfred.
There is no support for this in any source known. Camden based his edition on Parker&#x27;s manuscript, other transcripts of which do not include any such material. It is now acknowledged that this is an interpolation of Camden&#x27;s, though the legend itself first surfaced in the 14th century. Older books about Alfred the Great include the legend: for example, Jacob Abbott&#x27;s 1849 &quot;Alfred the Great&quot; says that &quot;One of the greatest and most important of the measures which Alfred adopted for the intellectual improvement of his people was the founding of the great University of Oxford.&quot;

==Claims of forgery==

During the 19th and 20th centuries, several scholars asserted that Asser&#x27;s biography of King Alfred was not authentic, but a forgery. A prominent claim was made in 1964 by the respected historian V.H. Galbraith in his essay &quot;Who Wrote Asser&#x27;s Life of Alfred?&quot; Galbraith argued that there were anachronisms in the text that meant it could not have been written during Asser&#x27;s lifetime. For example, Asser uses &quot;rex Angul Saxonum&quot; (&quot;king of the Anglo-Saxons&quot;) to refer to Alfred. Galbraith asserted that this usage does not appear until the late 10th century. Galbraith also identified the use of &quot;parochia&quot; to refer to Exeter as an anachronism, arguing that it should be translated as &quot;diocese&quot; and hence that it referred to the bishopric of Exeter, which was not created until 1050. Galbraith identified the true author as Leofric, who became Bishop of Devon and Cornwall in 1046. Leofric&#x27;s motive, according to Galbraith, was to justify the re-establishment of his see at Exeter by demonstrating a precedent for the arrangement.

The title &quot;king of the Anglo-Saxons&quot; does, however, in fact occur in royal charters that date to before 892 and &quot;parochia&quot; does not necessarily mean &quot;diocese&quot;, but can sometimes refer just to the jurisdiction of a church or monastery. In addition, there are other arguments against Leofric&#x27;s having been the forger. Aside from the fact that Leofric would have known little about Asser and so would have been unlikely to construct a plausible forgery, there is strong evidence dating the Cotton manuscript to about 1000. The apparent use of Asser&#x27;s material in other early works that predate Leofric also argues against Galbraith&#x27;s theory. Galbraith&#x27;s arguments were refuted to the satisfaction of most historians by Dorothy Whitelock in &quot;Genuine Asser&quot;, in the Stenton Lecture of 1967.

More recently, in 2002, Alfred Smyth has argued that the &quot;Life&quot; is a forgery by Byrhtferth, basing his case primarily on an analysis of Byrhtferth&#x27;s and Asser&#x27;s Latin vocabulary. Byrhtferth&#x27;s motive, according to Smyth, is to lend Alfred&#x27;s prestige to the Benedictine monastic reform movement of the late tenth century. However, the argument has not been found persuasive, and few historians harbour doubts about the authenticity of the work.

==Other works and date of death==
In addition to the &quot;Life of King Alfred&quot;, Asser is credited by Alfred as one of several scholars who assisted with Alfred&#x27;s translation of Pope Gregory I&#x27;s &quot;Regula Pastoralis&quot; (&quot;Pastoral Care&quot;). The historian William of Malmesbury, writing in the 12th century, believed that Asser also assisted Alfred with his translation of Boethius.

The &quot;Annales Cambriae,&quot; a set of Welsh annals that were probably kept at St David&#x27;s, records Asser&#x27;s death in the year 908. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records the following entry as part of the entry for 909 or 910 (in different versions of the chronicle): &quot;Here Frithustan succeeded to the bishopric in Winchester, and after that Asser, who was bishop at Sherborne, departed.&quot; The year given by the chronicle was uncertain, because different chroniclers started the new year at different calendar dates, and Asser&#x27;s date of death is generally given as 908/909.

===Potential rail-to-trails===
Union County Park Line rail trail is a proposed walking and/or biking trail proposed on old railroad tracks. Two abandoned rails exist in the county.

The City of Summit and the Summit Park Line Foundation are working on turning the line from Morris Avenue to Briant Park in Summit into a rail trail that will be approximately one mile long. This rail trail, potentially called the Summit Park Line, could provide a greenway to connect several county parks, akin to a Summit High Line. A path could run directly from Summit to the Arthur Kill in Linden, New Jersey on the Rahway Valley Railroad and the Staten Island Rapid Transit line.

The Summit city council applied for a $1 million grant toward the Summit Park Line project in November 2016. &quot;If Summit is able to complete the project, it might help other parts of the greenway come through,&quot; said Union County Public Relations Coordinator, Sebastian Delia.

The Rahway Valley Railroad runs from Summit to Roselle Park. Beginning in Hidden Valley Park, the railroad right-of-way continues by connecting Houdaille Quarry, Briant Park, Meisel Park, Rahway River Parkway, Galloping Hill Golf Course and Black Brook Park. The ending of the railway is on Westfield Avenue in Roselle Park. The Staten Island Rapid Transit runs from Cranford to Staten Island, although the project would only include the section that runs from Cranford to Linden. The possible inception in Cranford would be a lot on South Avenue East. The ending of this trail would be in Linden at an empty lot. A boardwalk would run over the existing tracks to ease line reactivation.

<text>In computer programming, lazy initialization is the tactic of delaying the creation of an object, the calculation of a value, or some other expensive process until the first time it is needed. It is a kind of lazy evaluation that refers specifically to the instantiation of objects or other resources.

This is typically accomplished by augmenting an accessor method (or property getter) to check whether a private member, acting as a cache, has already been initialized. If it has, it is returned straight away. If not, a new instance is created, placed into the member variable, and returned to the caller just-in-time for its first use. 

If objects have properties that are rarely used, this can improve startup speed. Mean average program performance may be slightly worse in terms of memory (for the condition variables) and execution cycles (to check them), but the impact of object instantiation is spread in time (&quot;amortized&quot;) rather than concentrated in the startup phase of a system, and thus median response times can be greatly improved.

In multithreaded code, access to lazy-initialized objects/state must be synchronized to guard against race conditions.

==The &quot;lazy factory&quot;==
In a software design pattern view, lazy initialization is often used together with a factory method pattern. This combines three ideas:
* Using a factory method to create instances of a class (factory method pattern)
* Storing the instances in a map, and returning the &quot;same&quot; instance to each request for an instance with &quot;same&quot; parameters (multiton pattern)
* Using lazy initialization to instantiate the object the first time it is requested (lazy initialization pattern)

==Examples==

===ActionScript 3===
The following is an example of a class with lazy initialization implemented in ActionScript:

package examples.lazyinstantiation
 public class Fruit 
 private var _typeName:String;
 private static var instancesByTypeName:Dictionary = new Dictionary();
 public function Fruit(typeName:String):void
 this._typeName = typeName;
 
 public function get typeName():String 
 return _typeName;
 
 public static function getFruitByTypeName(typeName:String):Fruit
 return instancesByTypeName[typeName] ||= new Fruit(typeName);
 
 public static function printCurrentTypes():void
 for each (var fruit:Fruit in instancesByTypeName) 
 // iterates through each value
 trace(fruit.typeName);
 }
}

Basic use:

package
 import examples.lazyinstantiation;
 public class Main 
 public function Main():void
 Fruit.getFruitByTypeName(&quot;Banana&quot;);
 Fruit.printCurrentTypes();
 Fruit.getFruitByTypeName(&quot;Apple&quot;);
 Fruit.printCurrentTypes();
 Fruit.getFruitByTypeName(&quot;Banana&quot;);
 Fruit.printCurrentTypes();
 }


===C===
In C, lazy evaluation would normally be implemented inside one function, or one source file, using static variables.

In a function:

#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

struct fruit {
 char *name;
 struct fruit *next;
 int number;
 /* Other members */

struct fruit *get_fruit(char *name) {
 static struct fruit *fruit_list;
 static int seq;
 struct fruit *f;
 for (f = fruit_list; f; f = f-&gt;next)
 if (0 == strcmp(name, f-&gt;name))
 return f;
 if (!(f = malloc(sizeof(struct fruit))))
 return NULL;
 if (!(f-&gt;name = strdup(name))) {
 free(f);
 return NULL;
 f-&gt;number = ++seq;
 f-&gt;next = fruit_list;
 fruit_list = f;
 return f;

/* Example code */

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
 int i;
 struct fruit *f;
 if (argc &lt; 2) {
 fprintf(stderr, &quot;Usage: fruits fruit-name [...]\n&quot;);
 exit(1);
 for (i = 1; i &lt; argc; i++) {
 if ((f = get_fruit(argv[i]))) {
 printf(&quot;Fruit %s: number %d\n&quot;, argv[i], f-&gt;number);
 }
 return 0;

Using one source file instead allows the state to be shared between multiple functions, while still hiding it from non-related functions.

fruit.h:
#ifndef _FRUIT_INCLUDED_
#define _FRUIT_INCLUDED_

struct fruit {
 char *name;
 struct fruit *next;
 int number;
 /* Other members */

struct fruit *get_fruit(char *name);
void print_fruit_list(FILE *file);

#endif /* _FRUIT_INCLUDED_ */
fruit.c:

#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &quot;fruit.h&quot;

static struct fruit *fruit_list;
static int seq;

struct fruit *get_fruit(char *name) {
 struct fruit *f;
 for (f = fruit_list; f; f = f-&gt;next)
 if (0 == strcmp(name, f-&gt;name))
 return f;
 if (!(f = malloc(sizeof(struct fruit))))
 return NULL;
 if (!(f-&gt;name = strdup(name))) {
 free(f);
 return NULL;
 f-&gt;number = ++seq;
 f-&gt;next = fruit_list;
 fruit_list = f;
 return f;

void print_fruit_list(FILE *file) {
 struct fruit *f;
 for (f = fruit_list; f; f = f-&gt;next)
 fprintf(file, &quot;%4d %s\n&quot;, f-&gt;number, f-&gt;name);


main.c:
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &quot;fruit.h&quot;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
 int i;
 struct fruit *f;
 if (argc &lt; 2) {
 fprintf(stderr, &quot;Usage: fruits fruit-name [...]\n&quot;);
 exit(1);
 for (i = 1; i &lt; argc; i++) {
 if ((f = get_fruit(argv[i]))) {
 printf(&quot;Fruit %s: number %d\n&quot;, argv[i], f-&gt;number);
 }
 printf(&quot;The following fruits have been generated:\n&quot;);
 print_fruit_list(stdout);
 return 0;


===C#===
In .NET Framework 4.0 Microsoft has included a codice_1 class that can be used to do lazy loading.
Below is some dummy code that does lazy loading of Class codice_2

var lazyFruit = new Lazy&lt;Fruit&gt;();
Fruit fruit = lazyFruit.Value;
Here is a dummy example in C#.

The codice_2 class itself doesn&#x27;t do anything here, The class variable codice_4 is a Dictionary/Map used to store codice_2 instances by codice_6.
using System;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class Fruit
 private string _typeName;
 private static IDictionary&lt;string, Fruit&gt; _typesDictionary = new Dictionary&lt;string, Fruit&gt;();

 private Fruit(string typeName)
 this._typeName = typeName;

 public static Fruit GetFruitByTypeName(string type)
 Fruit fruit;

 if (!_typesDictionary.TryGetValue(type, out fruit))
 // Lazy initialization
 fruit = new Fruit(type);

 _typesDictionary.Add(type, fruit);

 return fruit;

 public static void ShowAll()
 if (_typesDictionary.Count &gt; 0)
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;Number of instances made = {0}&quot;, _typesDictionary.Count);
 foreach (KeyValuePair&lt;string, Fruit&gt; kvp in _typesDictionary)
 Console.WriteLine(kvp.Key);
 
 Console.WriteLine();
 }
 public Fruit()
 // required so the sample compiles
}

class Program
 static void Main(string[] args)
 Fruit.GetFruitByTypeName(&quot;Banana&quot;);
 Fruit.ShowAll();

 Fruit.GetFruitByTypeName(&quot;Apple&quot;);
 Fruit.ShowAll();

 // returns pre-existing instance from first 
 // time Fruit with &quot;Banana&quot; was created
 Fruit.GetFruitByTypeName(&quot;Banana&quot;);
 Fruit.ShowAll();

 Console.ReadLine();
}

A fairly straightforward &#x27;fill-in-the-blanks&#x27; example of a Lazy Initialization design pattern, except that this uses an enumeration for the type

namespace DesignPatterns.LazyInitialization;

public class LazyFactoryObject
 // internal collection of items
 // IDictionary makes sure they are unique
 private IDictionary&lt;LazyObjectSize, LazyObject&gt; _LazyObjectList =
 new Dictionary&lt;LazyObjectSize, LazyObject&gt;();

 // enum for passing name of size required
 // avoids passing strings and is part of LazyObject ahead
 public enum LazyObjectSize
 None,
 Small,
 Big,
 Bigger,
 Huge

 // standard type of object that will be constructed
 public struct LazyObject
 public LazyObjectSize Size;
 public IList&lt;int&gt; Result;

 // takes size and create &#x27;expensive&#x27; list
 private IList&lt;int&gt; Result(LazyObjectSize size)
 IList&lt;int&gt; result = null;

 switch (size)
 case LazyObjectSize.Small:
 result = CreateSomeExpensiveList(1, 100);
 break;
 case LazyObjectSize.Big:
 result = CreateSomeExpensiveList(1, 1000);
 break;
 case LazyObjectSize.Bigger:
 result = CreateSomeExpensiveList(1, 10000);
 break;
 case LazyObjectSize.Huge:
 result = CreateSomeExpensiveList(1, 100000);
 break;
 case LazyObjectSize.None:
 result = null;
 break;
 default:
 result = null;
 break;

 return result;

 // not an expensive item to create, but you get the point
 // delays creation of some expensive object until needed
 private IList&lt;int&gt; CreateSomeExpensiveList(int start, int end)
 IList&lt;int&gt; result = new List&lt;int&gt;();

 for (int counter = 0; counter &lt; (end - start); counter++)
 result.Add(start + counter);

 return result;

 public LazyFactoryObject()
 // empty constructor

 public LazyObject GetLazyFactoryObject(LazyObjectSize size)
 // yes, i know it is illiterate and inaccurate
 LazyObject noGoodSomeOne;

 // retrieves LazyObjectSize from list via out, else creates one and adds it to list
 if (!_LazyObjectList.TryGetValue(size, out noGoodSomeOne))
 noGoodSomeOne = new LazyObject();
 noGoodSomeOne.Size = size;
 noGoodSomeOne.Result = this.Result(size);

 _LazyObjectList.Add(size, noGoodSomeOne);

 return noGoodSomeOne;
}

===Smalltalk===
This example is in Smalltalk, of a typical accessor method to return the value of a variable using lazy initialization.
 height
 ^height ifNil: [height := 2.0].

The &#x27;non-lazy&#x27; alternative is to use an initialization method that is run when the object is created and then use a simpler accessor method to fetch the value.
 initialize
 height := 2.0

 height
 ^height
Note that lazy initialization can also be used in non-object-oriented languages.

== Theoretical computer science ==

In the field of theoretical computer science, lazy initialization (also called a lazy array) is a technique to design data structures that can work with memory that does not need to be initialized. Specifically, assume that we have access to a table &quot;T&quot; of &quot;n&quot; uninitialized memory cells (numbered from &quot;1&quot; to &quot;n&quot;), and want to assign &quot;m&quot; cells of this array, e.g., we want to assign &quot;T&quot;[&quot;ki&quot;] := &quot;vi&quot; for pairs (&quot;k&quot;1, &quot;v&quot;1), ..., (&quot;km&quot;, &quot;vm&quot;) with all &quot;ki&quot; being different. The lazy initialization technique allows us to do this in just O(&quot;m&quot;) operations, rather than spending O(&quot;m&quot;+&quot;n&quot;) operations to first initialize all array cells. The technique is simply to allocate a table &quot;V&quot; storing the pairs (&quot;ki&quot;, &quot;vi&quot;) in some arbitrary order, and to write for each &quot;i&quot; in the cell &quot;T&quot;[&quot;ki&quot;] the position in &quot;V&quot; where key &quot;ki&quot; is stored, leaving the other cells of &quot;T&quot; uninitialized. This can be used to handle queries in the following fashion: when we look up cell &quot;T&quot;[&quot;k&quot;] for some &quot;k&quot;, we can check if &quot;T&quot;[&quot;k&quot;] is in the range {1, ..., &quot;m&quot;}: if it is not, then &quot;T&quot;[&quot;k&quot;] is uninitialized. Otherwise, we check &quot;V&quot;[&quot;T&quot;[&quot;k&quot;]], and verify that the first component of this pair is equal to &quot;k&quot;. If it is not, then &quot;T&quot;[&quot;k&quot;] is uninitialized (and just happened by accident to fall in the range {1, ..., &quot;m&quot;}). Otherwise, we know that &quot;T&quot;[&quot;k&quot;] is indeed one of the initialized cells, and the corresponding value is the second component of the pair.

<text>Sussex County () is the northernmost county in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Its county seat is Newton. It is part of the New York metropolitan area and is part of New Jersey&#x27;s Skylands Region. As of the 2020 census, the county was the state&#x27;s 17th-most-populous county, with a population of 144,221, a decrease of 5,044 (−3.4%) from the 2010 census count of 149,265, which in turn reflected an increase of 5,099 (+3.5%) over the 144,166 persons at the 2000 census. Based on 2020 census data, Vernon Township was the county&#x27;s largest in both population and area, with a population of 22,358 and covering an area of . The county is part of the North Jersey region of the state.

In 2015, the county had a per capita personal income of $55,497, the ninth-highest in New Jersey and ranked 220th of 3,113 counties in the United States. The Bureau of Economic Analysis ranked the county as having the 131st-highest per capita income ($49,207) of the 3,113 counties in the United States (and the ninth-highest in the state).

==Etymology==
The county was established in 1753 from portions of Morris County and named after the county of Sussex in England.

==History==

The area of Sussex County and its surrounding region was occupied for approximately 8,000-13,000 years by succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples. The Munsee Indians inhabited the region at the time of European encounter. The Munsee were a loosely organized division of the Lenape (or Lenni Lenape), a Native American people also called &quot;Delaware Indians&quot; after their historic territory along the Delaware River. The Lenape inhabited the Mid-Atlantic coastal areas and inland along the Hudson and Delaware rivers. The Munsee spoke a very distinct dialect of the Lenape and inhabited a region bounded by the Hudson River, the headwaters of the Delaware River and the Susquehanna River, and south to the Lehigh River and Conewago Creek. As a result of disruption following the French and Indian War (1756–1763), the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), and later Indian removals from the eastern United States, the main Lenape groups now live in Ontario in Canada, and in Wisconsin and Oklahoma in the United States.
As early as 1690, Dutch and French Huguenot colonists from towns along the Hudson River Valley in New York began permanently settling in the Upper Delaware Valley (known as the &quot;Minisink&quot;). The route these Dutch settlers had taken was the path of an old Indian trail and became the route of the Old Mine Road and stretches of present-date U.S. Route 209. These Dutch settlers penetrated the Minisink Valley and settled as far south as the Delaware Water Gap, by 1731 this valley had been incorporated as Walpack Precinct. Throughout the 18th century, immigrants from the Rheinland Palatinate in Germany and Switzerland fled religious wars and poverty to arrive in Philadelphia and New York City. Several German families began leaving Philadelphia to settle along river valleys in Northwestern New Jersey and Pennsylvania&#x27;s Lehigh Valley in the 1720s, spreading north into Sussex County in the 1740s and 1750s as additional German emigrants arrived. Also during this time, Scottish settlers from Elizabethtown and Perth Amboy, and English settlers from these cities, Long Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts, came to New Jersey and moved up the tributaries of the Passaic and Raritan rivers, settling in the eastern sections of present-day Sussex and Warren counties.

By the 1750s, residents of this area began to petition colonial authorities for a new county to be formed; they complained of the inconvenience of long travel to conduct business with the government and the courts. By this time, four large townships had been created in this sparsely populated Northwestern region: Walpack Township (before 1731), Greenwich Township (before 1738), Hardwick Township (1750) and Newtown Township (1751). On June 8, 1753, Sussex County was created from these four municipalities, which had been part of Morris County when Morris stretched over all of northwestern New Jersey. Sussex County at this time encompassed present-day Sussex and Warren Counties and its boundaries were drawn by the New York-New Jersey border to the north, the Delaware River to the west, and the Musconetcong River to the south and east. After several decades of debate over where to hold the sessions of the county&#x27;s courts, the state legislature eventually voted to divide Sussex County in two, using a line drawn from the juncture of the Flat Brook and Delaware River in a southeasterly direction to the Musconetcong River running through the Yellow Frame Presbyterian Church in present-day Fredon Township (then part of Hardwick). On November 20, 1824, Warren County was created from the southern territory of the Sussex County.
Throughout the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, Sussex County&#x27;s economy was largely centered around agriculture and the mining of iron and zinc ores. Early settlers established farms whose operations were chiefly focused towards subsistence agriculture. Because of geological constraints, Sussex County&#x27;s agricultural production was centered around dairy farming. Several farms had orchards—typically apples and peaches—and surplus fruit and grains were often distilled or brewed into alcoholic beverages (hard ciders, applejack and fruit brandies). This was the economic model until the mid-19th century when advances in food preservation and the introduction of railroads (e.g. the Sussex Railroad) into the area allowed Sussex County to transport farm products throughout the region. Railroads also promoted the building of factories as companies relocated to the area at the end of the 19th century—including that of the H.W. Merriam Shoe Company (1873) in Newton.

The Highlands Region of Northwestern New Jersey has proven to possess rich deposits of iron ore. In the mid 18th century, several entrepreneurial colonists began mining iron in area around Andover, Hamburg, and Franklin present-day Sussex County and establishing forges and furnaces to create pig iron and bar iron. During the American Revolution, the Quartermaster Department of the Continental Army complained to Congress of difficulties in acquiring iron to support the war effort and the Congress ordered two colonels, Benjamin Flower and Thomas Maybury to take possession of the iron works at Andover in order to equip General Washington&#x27;s army. During the middle of the 19th century, under the management of Cooper and Hewitt, the Andover mine produced 50,000 tons of iron ore each year. The firm manufactured railroad rails and the country&#x27;s first structural steel, which and led to the building of railroads and commercial development in the county. Iron from the Andover mines was fashioned into cable wire for the bridge built at Niagara Falls and for the beams used to rebuild Princeton University&#x27;s Nassau Hall in Princeton, New Jersey after a fire undermined the structure in 1855. During the American Civil War, Andover iron found its way into rifle barrels and cannonballs just as it had during the Revolution years before.

As deposits were depleted, the iron mining industry began to diminish by the mid-19th century. During the late 19th century, prolific American inventor Thomas Edison began to explore the commercial opportunities of processing poor-quality low-grade iron ore to combat the growing scarcity of iron deposits in the United States. He began to purchase mining companies in Sussex County in the 1880s and consolidating their assets. He developed a process of crushing and milling iron-bearing minerals and separating iron ore from the material through large electromagnets, and built one of the world&#x27;s largest ore-crushing mills near Ogdensburg. Completed in 1889, the factory contained three giant electromagnets and was intended to process up to 1200 tons of iron ore every day. However, technical difficulties repeatedly thwarted production. However, in the 1890s, richer soft-grade iron ore deposits located in Minnesota&#x27;s Iron Range rendered Edison&#x27;s Ogdensburg operation unprofitable and he closed the works in 1900. Edison adapted the process and machinery for the cement industry and invested in producing Portland Cement in other locations.
In the early 19th century, Samuel Fowler (1779–1844) settled in Franklin Furnace (now Franklin) to open up a medical practice, but is largely known for his interest in mineralogy which led to his developing commercial uses for zinc and for discovery of several rare minerals (chiefly various ores of zinc). Many of these zinc minerals are known for fluorescing in vivid colors when exposed to ultraviolet light. Because of both the rich deposits and many of these minerals are not found anywhere else on earth, Franklin is known as the &quot;Fluorescent Mineral Capitol of the World&quot;. Fowler, who later briefly served in elected political office, operated the local iron works and bought several abandoned zinc and iron mines in the area. Shortly after his death, two companies were created to exploit the iron and zinc deposits in this region; they acquired the rights to Fowler&#x27;s holdings in Franklin and nearby Sterling Hill. These companies later merged to form the New Jersey Zinc Corporation (today known as &quot;Horsehead Industries&quot;). At this time, Russian, Chilean, British, Irish, Hungarian and Polish immigrants came to Franklin to work in the mines, and the population of Franklin swelled from 500 (in 1897) to over 3,000 (in 1913). Declining deposits in the Franklin area, the expense of pumping groundwater from mine shafts, tax disputes and misdirected investments by the company led to the abandonment of the mines. Today, both the Franklin and Sterling Hill mines are operated as museums.

Beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, construction or improvements of Interstate 80, Route 181 and Route 23 triggered rapid growth to Sussex County. Since 1950, the population nearly quadrupled from 34,423 people to 130,943 people in 1990. This has caused Sussex County to begin developing into a light suburban atmosphere, instead of the sparsely populated rural region it once was, especially in the eastern half of the county.

==Geology==

Around 450 million years ago, the Martinsburg Shale was uplifted when a chain of volcanic islands collided with proto North America. These islands slid over the North American plate, and deposited rock on top of the plate, forming the Highlands and Kittatinny Valley.
At that time the western part of Sussex County was under a shallow inland sea. Fossils of sea shells and fish can be found west of the Kittatinny ridge. Then approximately 400 million years ago, a small, narrow continent collided with North America. Pressure from the collision, created heat in the bed rock which folded and faulted the Silurian Shawangunk Conglomerate that was under the shallow sea. The pressure created intense heat, melted the quartzite, and allowed it to bend, creating an uplift. as cooling occurred this cemented the quartz pebbles and conglomerate together. This is how the Kittatinny Ridge was created. The strike from this continent was from the south east, this is why the Kittatinny ridge is on a northeast–southwest axis.
The Wisconsin glacier which covered the entire county from 23,000B.C to 13,000 B.C. created many lakes and streams. The glacier covered Kittatinny mountain.

As climate warmed around 13,000 B.C., the area was first a tundra with lichens and mosses. After a few thousand years, coniferous forests began to grow. As climate grew warmer around 8000 B.C., deciduous forests began to grow with nut trees such as oak, and maple. Around 3000 B.C. other nut bearing trees began to grow such as hickory, butternut, walnut and beech. This allowed the Paleo Indian populations to increase.
The county is drained by the Paulinskill River, the Flatbrook, which drain into the Delaware River, the Wallkill River which flows north to the Hudson River. There are many smaller creeks that drain into these water sheds.

===Physiographic provinces===
Sussex County is located within two of New Jersey&#x27;s physiographic provinces: (1) The Ridge and Valley Appalachians, and (2) the New York-New Jersey Highlands regions.

The features of the Ridge and Valley province were created approximately 400 million years ago during the Ordovician period and Appalachian orogeny— by a continent striking North America the creating Kittatinny Mountain, Blue Mountain, and the Appalachian Mountains. This physiographic province occupies approximately two-thirds of the county&#x27;s area (the county&#x27;s western and central sections) dominated by Kittatinny Mountain and the Kittatinny Valley. This province&#x27;s contour is characterized by long, even ridges with long, continuous valleys in between that generally run parallel from southwest to northeast. This region is largely formed by sedimentary rock.

The New York-New Jersey Highlands, or Highlands region, located in the county&#x27;s eastern section is older. An extension of the Reading Prong formation stretching from Pennsylvania to Connecticut, the Highlands were created from geological forces created from when a small continent went over the North American plate. This rock created the highlands of Sussex County. Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock approximately 500 million years ago. The watersheds within the Highlands provide fresh water resources for millions of residents in New Jersey and the New York City Metropolitan Area. Because of this, the region was protected by the New Jersey Legislature and Governor Jim McGreevey under the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act enacted in 2004. This act sought to protect these water resources from development by promoting open space and farmland preservation, creating new recreational parks, and consolidating the regulatory authority over land use planning in a regional planning commission known as the Highlands Council.

===Mountains and valleys===

The Delaware River forms the western and northwestern boundary of Sussex County. This region is known as the Upper Delaware Valley and historically as the Minisink or Minisink Valley. Elevations in the regions along the river range from 300 to 500 feet.

Kittatinny Mountain is the dominant geological feature in the western section of the county. It is part of the Appalachian Mountains, and part of a ridge that continues as the Blue Mountain in Eastern Pennsylvania, and as Shawangunk Ridge in New York to the north. It begins in New Jersey as the eastern half of the Delaware Water Gap, and runs northeast to southwest along the Delaware River. Elevations range from and attains a maximum elevation of at High Point, in Montague Township. Between Kittatinny Mountain and the Delaware River is the Wallpack Ridge, a smaller, narrow ridge spanning in length from the Walpack Bend near Flatbrookville north to Port Jervis, New York. Wallpack Ridge encloses the watershed of the Flat Brook and its two main tributaries Little Flat Brook and Big Flat Brook, and ranges in elevation from and reaching its highest elevation at .
The Kittatinny Valley lies to the east of Kittatinny Mountain and ends with the Highlands in the east. It is largely a region of rolling hills and flat valley floors. Elevations in this valley range from 400 to 1,000 feet. It is part of the Great Appalachian Valley running from eastern Canada to northern Alabama. This valley is shared by three major watersheds—the Wallkill River, with its tributaries Pochuck Creek and Papakating Creek flowing north; and the Paulins Kill watershed and Pequest River watershed flowing southwest. This valley floor consists of shale and slate (part of the Ordovician Martinsburg Formation) and of limestone (part of the Jacksonburg Formation). Several parties have argued about the possibility of natural gas extraction in the region&#x27;s Martinsburg and Utica shale formations, similar to the Marcellus Shale formations to the West in Pennsylvania and New York. Of special interest is Rutan Hill, a 440-million-year-old patch of igneous rock known as nepheline syenite. This site, north of Beemerville in Wantage Township, was once an ancient volcano—the only extant dormant volcano site in the state.

Dividing the Kittatinny Valley (and the Ridge and Valley Province) from the Highlands region is a narrow fault of Hardyston Quartzite. Many of the mountains in the Highlands are not part of a solid, linear ridge and tend to randomly rise from the surrounding land as the result of folds, faults and intrusions. Elevations in the Highlands region range from 1,000 to 1,500 feet. The more prominent mountains in this area are Hamburg Mountain (elevation: ), Wawayanda Mountain (elevation: ), Sparta Mountain (elevation: ) and Pochuck Mountain (elevation: ) which form a ridge along the county&#x27;s eastern flank.

===Rivers and watersheds===

Sussex County&#x27;s rivers and watersheds flow in three directions; north to the Hudson River, west and south to the Delaware River, and east toward Newark Bay.
* Wallkill River is an river starting at its source at Lake Mohawk in Sparta Township drains north into Rondout Creek, a tributary of the Hudson River. The Wallkill River drains a watershed.
* Pochuck Creek is an creek flowing north into the Wallkill River.
* Papakating Creek is a creek in the north central region of the county beginning in Frankford Township also drains into the Wallkill.
* Clove Creek is a creek that flows into the Papakating Creek near Lewisburg in Wantage Township.
* The Flat Brook is a creek flowing through Walpack and Sandyston Townships, joins the Delaware River at the Walpack Bend. It has two main tributaries: the Little Flat Brook whose length is and Big Flat Brook whose length is .
* The Paulins Kill is a river with its two branches: the West Branch is fed by Bear Swamp, Lake Owassa, Culver&#x27;s Lake, and the Dry Brook in Frankford Township, the Main or East Branch starting at Newton combining near Augusta to flow southwest through Hampton, Stillwater, Hardwick, Blairstown, and Knowlton townships to join the Delaware River near the Delaware Water Gap. The Paulins Kill drains a watershed.
* The Pequest River is a beginning near Newton and Springdale and flowing through in Andover and Green Township, then through Warren County before joining the Delaware near Belvidere.
* The Musconetcong River is a river beginning at Lake Hopatcong, forms the eastern border between Warren County and Morris and Hunterdon Counties. Its main tributaries are Lubbers Run and Punkhorn Creek.
* Small sections of eastern Sussex County drain into the watersheds of the Pequannock River, Passaic River, and Rockaway River which end in Newark Bay.

Historically, these rivers and streams were used to power various types of mills (i.e. grist mills, fulling mills, etc.), transport goods to market, and later to generate electric power (after 1880). Today, these rivers are chiefly used in local recreational activities—including canoeing and fishing. The Fish Culture Unit of the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife stocks these waterways each year with various species of trout. Some of these rivers—especially the Flat Brook, Paulins Kill and Pequest—have become well known as trout streams and for their suitability for fly-fishing. The Flat Brook and its tributary the Big Flat Brook are regarded as the state&#x27;s premiere trout stream.

===Soils===

According to the Natural Resource Conservation Service, Sussex County soils are derived from parent materials that are largely till and glaciofluvial deposits, alluvium, and organic matter deposits. Till is the rock of soil material transported or deposited by glacial ice. In this case, the most recent glaciation (i.e. the last ice age), the Wisconsinian continental glacier, deposited a till plain composed of ground and recessional moraines. This glaciation reached its maximum extent roughly 22,000 years ago. Glaciofluvial deposits (or &quot;outwash&quot;) are rock and soil materials that melting glaciers deposit as the glacier recedes. Alluvium is materials that are deposited by floodwaters from engorged bodies of water—chiefly streams and rivers. Organic deposits are largely the result of decomposing plant material.

==Geography and climate==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of the 2020 Census, the county had a total area of , of which was land (96.8%) and was water (3.2%). It is the fourth-largest of the state&#x27;s 21 counties in terms of area.

Sussex County lies within the Kittatinny Mountains of Northwestern New Jersey and the overall Appalachian Mountains range. High Point, located at the northernmost tip of New Jersey in Montague Township, is the highest natural elevation in the state at above sea level. Nearby, Sunrise Mountain in Stokes State Forest has an elevation of . Many mountains in the Highlands region range from . Officially, the county&#x27;s lowest elevation is approximately above sea level along the Delaware River near Flatbrookville. However, local authorities claim unofficially that the mine adit descending at the Sterling Hill Mine in Ogdensburg is the lowest elevation in New Jersey.

Because of its topography, Sussex County has remained a relatively rural and forested area. In the western half of the county, several state and federal parks have kept the large tracts of land undeveloped and in their natural states. The eastern half of the county has had more suburban development because of its proximity to more populated areas and commercial development zones.

With its location at the top of New Jersey, Sussex County is the only county to neighbor both New York and Pennsylvania. Because it is shaped roughly like a diamond or rhombus with its point matching the cardinal points of the compass, its boundary lines are roughly oriented along the ordinal or intercardinal directions.

===Climate===
Because of its location in the higher elevations of northwestern New Jersey&#x27;s Appalachian mountains, Sussex County has a cooler humid continental climate or microthermal climate (Köppen Dfb) which indicates patterns of significant precipitation in all seasons and at least four months where the average temperature rises above This differs from the rest of the state which is generally a humid mesothermal climate, in which temperatures range between during the year&#x27;s coldest month. Sussex County is part of USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 6.

During winter and early spring, New Jersey in some years is subject to &quot;nor&#x27;easters&quot;—significant storm systems that have proven capable of causing blizzards or flooding throughout the northeastern United States. Hurricanes and tropical storms, tornadoes, and earthquakes are relatively rare. The Kittatinny Valley to the north of Newton, part of the Great Appalachian Valley, experiences a snowbelt phenomenon and has been categorized as a microclimate region known as the &quot;Sussex County Snow Belt&quot;. This region receives approximately forty to fifty inches of snow per year and generally more snowfall that the rest of Northern New Jersey and the Northern Climate Zone. This phenomenon is attributed to the orographic lift of the Kittatinny Ridge which impacts local weather patterns by increasing humidity and precipitation, providing the ski resorts of Vernon Valley in the northeastern part of this region with increased snowfall.

In recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Newton have ranged from a low of in January to a high of in July. Average monthly precipitation ranged from in February to in June.

According to the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service soil survey, the area receives sunshine approximately 62% of the time in summer and 48% in winter. Prevailing winds are typically from the southwest for most of year; but in late winter and early spring come from the northwest. The lowest recorded temperature was −26 °F on January 21, 1994. The highest recorded temperature was on September 3, 1953. The heaviest one-day snowfall was recorded on January 8, 1996; combined with the next day, total snowfall was . The heaviest one-day rainfall - was recorded on August 19, 1955.

The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 98.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 95.6 males.

===Affluence and poverty===
Sussex County is considered an affluent area as many of its residents are college-educated, employed in professional or service jobs, and earn above the state&#x27;s average per capita income and household income statistics. , the Bureau of Economic Analysis ranked the county as having the 131st-highest per capita income of all 3,113 counties in the United States (and the ninth-highest in New Jersey). Average per capita income was $49,207 and was 23.2% above the national average.

As of the 2000 Census, the median household income was $65,266 and the median family income was $73,335. Males had a median income of $44,544 compared with $32,487 for females. The per capita income for the county was $26,992. About 6.30% of families and 8.40% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.50% of those under age 18 and 8.00% of those age 65 or over.

The median value of all homes in Sussex County as of Q4 2021 was $323,687, up 12.1% from the prior year. , there were a total of 54,881 households enumerated in the 2010 census, with a reported median household income of $84,115, or mean household income of $96,527. Males had a median income of $50,395 versus $33,750 for females. The per capita income for the county was $26,992. About 2.8% of families and 4.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.1% of those under age 18 and 5.4% of those age 65 or over.

As of the 2006–2010 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, 3.6% of county residents were living below the poverty line which the government defined as an annual household income under $22,350 for a family of four. However, recent surveys indicate that in the county&#x27;s town centers, Sussex Borough (15.1%), Newton (12.8%) and Andover Borough (12.7%), poverty levels reach double-digits. Of these poverty-level residents, an estimated 44% are employed, many of them underemployed despite working multiple jobs.

==Economy==
The Bureau of Economic Analysis calculated that the county&#x27;s gross domestic product was $4.6 billion in 2021, which was ranked 20th in the state and was a 3.9% increase from the prior year.

===Employment and labor force===
As of the 2010 Census, the county&#x27;s unemployment rate was 11.0%. The Census Bureau reported a population of 118,420 persons (above age 16) available for the labor force of which 82,449 (69.6%) were actively employed in civilian labor, and 35,971 (30.4%) were not in the labor force.

Early industry and commerce chiefly centered on agriculture, milling, and iron mining. As iron deposits were exhausted, mining shifted toward zinc deposits near Franklin and Ogdensburg during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The local economy expanded due to the introduction of railroads and shortly after the Civil War, the town centers hosted factories. However, the factories, railroads and mining declined by the late 1960s. Today, Sussex County features a mix of rural farmland, forests and suburban development. Because agriculture (chiefly dairy farming) has decreased and that the county hosts little industry, Sussex County is considered a &quot;bedroom community&quot; as most residents commute to neighboring counties (Bergen, Essex and Morris counties) or to New York City for work.

===Agricultural production===
Although Sussex County&#x27;s dairy farming industry has declined significantly in the last 50 years it is still the majority of agricultural production in the region. Trucking has replaced railroads in the transportation of milk products to regional production facilities and markets. Rising taxes, regulation and decreasing profitability in dairy farming have forced farmers to adapt by growing other products or converting their farms to other uses. Many farmers have sold their properties to real estate developers who have built residential housing. Many Sussex County farms are nursery farms producing ornamental trees, plants and flowers used in horticulture, floristry or landscaping. Christmas trees and nursery and greenhouse plants contribute to 51% of the county&#x27;s annual crop revenues but account for 30% of crop production.

Despite the decline of dairy farming, it is still the largest contributor to the county&#x27;s annual agricultural revenues. According to the &quot;Sussex County Comprehensive Farmland Preservation Plan&quot; (2008):
According to county agricultural statistics, 17.3% of all crop sales ($1.4 million in 2002) were in hay. Nearly 80% of tilled farmland, or , on 43% of the farms in the county is dedicated to hay production. Much of hay is grown for feed on livestock farms — especially dairy farms — and never makes it to market and is therefore not included in federal agricultural census data. In 2002, were dedicated to corn cultivation, the majority of it used for feed on the same farms.

According to the 2007 Census of Agriculture compiled by the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#x27;s National Agricultural Statistics Service, Sussex County has 1,060 farms totaling out of New Jersey&#x27;s total 10,327 farms managing . This is up from 1,029 farms in the 2002 Census estimate. However, acreage dedicated to agriculture declined by 13.6% from in 2002. Note though that 102,547 acres—roughly 30% of the county&#x27;s land area—are under farmland assessment for the purpose of calculating property tax levies.
This decrease is total acreage is due, in large part, to &quot;suburban sprawl&quot; as farmers capitalized by converting to commercial and residential development.
The average size of a farm in 2007 was acres, down from . The 2007 acreage dedicated to agriculture is roughly 19.6% of the county&#x27;s land area. The county-wide total agricultural product sales in 2007 was $21,242,000, up from $14,756,000 in 2002. Total county market value of land and buildings in 2007 was $888,955,000, an increase from $520,997,000 in 2002. The average market value per farm was $838,636 (2007), up from $505,823 (2002). This results in a per acre price of $13,625 (2007), up from $7,136 (2002).

With the repeal of several prohibition-era alcohol laws in 1981, 43 wineries have become licensed and are operating in the state. New Jersey wines have grown in stature due to increased marketing and quality, recent successes and awards in competitions, and appreciation by critics. Sussex County is home to three established and operating wineries and three more are in development.

===Industry and manufacturing===
Sussex County&#x27;s industrial and manufacturing base is no longer towards heavy industry and mining. Today, companies like Thorlabs, are located here.

== Municipalities==

The 24 municipalities in Sussex County (with 2010 Census data for population, housing units and area) are:

== Government ==
===County government===

Sussex County is governed by the Sussex County Board of County Commissioners whose five members are elected at-large in partisan elections on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year. At an annual reorganization meeting held in the beginning of January, the board selects a Commissioner Director and Deputy Director from among its members, with day-to-day supervision of the operation of the county delegated to a County Administrator. , Sussex County&#x27;s Commissioners are (with terms for director and deputy director ending every December 31):

The commissioners appoint a County Administrator to oversee the day-to-day management of the county. The Administrator is Ron Tappan, whose three-year appointment expires December 31, 2025. Many services overseen by the county government overlap with those provided at the municipal level. The County government oversees and administers the following areas of responsibility: 
Before 1911, two commissioners from each township were elected annually to serve on the board. However, as this became unwieldy in the late 19th century during the era of Boroughitis and the creation of hundreds of new municipalities, the State Legislature chose to reorganize the size of county freeholder boards to an odd number between three and nine members. The size of the board was a reflection of the county&#x27;s population. As Sussex County was rural and among the least populated counties in the state, for the next 80 years, Sussex County&#x27;s Board of Chosen Freeholders consisted of three elected members. The board increased from three to five members as of January 1, 1990, based on the results of a referendum. No Democrat has been elected to countywide office since 1999. In May 2022, Jill Space was appointed to fill the seat expiring in December 2022 that had been held by Sylvia Petillo until she resigned from office.

Pursuant to Article VII Section II of the New Jersey State Constitution, each county in New Jersey is required to have three elected administrative officials known as &quot;constitutional officers&quot;. These officers are the County Clerk and County Surrogate (both elected for five-year terms of office) and the County Sheriff (elected for a three-year term). Sussex County&#x27;s constitutional officers are:

The Sussex County Prosecutor is Francis A. Koch of Hardyston Township, who was nominated to the position by Governor of New Jersey Chris Christie in June 2014. Sussex County is a part of Vicinage 10 of the New Jersey Superior Court (along with Morris County), which is seated at the Morris County Courthouse in Morristown; the Assignment Judge for Vicinage 10 is Stuart A. Minkowitz. Cases venued in Sussex County are heard at the Sussex County Judicial Center in Newton.

===Federal representatives===
Two congressional districts cover Sussex County, with the northern part of the county in the 5th congressional district and the southern part in the 7th congressional district. 

===State represenatatives===
All of Sussex County is located in one legislative district.

== Politics ==
Sussex County is the second-most Republican county in New Jersey, behind only Ocean County. Among registered voters, affiliations with the Republican Party outpace those of the Democratic Party by a ratio of about five to two. All five members of the board of county commissioners, all three county-wide constitutional officers, and all three state legislators. The Republican presidential candidate has carried the county in all but one election since 1920. The lone exception is 1964, when Lyndon B. Johnson won 44 states and carried every county in New Jersey. Republican Donald Trump carried the county in 2020, though it was the best Democratic performance since 1964. As of October 1, 2021, there were a total of 117,681 registered voters in Sussex County, of whom 49,184 (41.8%) were registered as Republicans, 26,800 (22.8%) were registered as Democrats and 39,878 (33.9%) were registered as unaffiliated. There were 1,819 voters (1.5%) registered to other parties. Among the county&#x27;s 2010 Census population, 65.8% were registered to vote, including 86.5% of those ages 18 and over.















== Law enforcement ==

Municipalities that do not have their own police departments have services provided by the New Jersey State Police. One of the primary responsibilities of the New Jersey State Police is to provide police services to these rural towns, for which the municipality is assessed an annual fee paid to the state government Troop B of the New Jersey State Police operates a Sussex station located on Route 206 in Augusta. Fewer than half of the county&#x27;s municipalities have a local police department. Police Departments are located in the municipalities of Vernon, Hardyston, Sparta, Byram, Hopatcong, Stanhope, Andover, Newton, Ogdensburg, Franklin, and Hamburg. The other 13 municipalities are rural and rely on State Police coverage. Stillwater Township disbanded its police department in December 2009, estimating a savings of $482,000 by having State Police coverage.

The New Jersey State Park Police has jurisdiction throughout the state, but patrol primarily in Stokes State Forest and other local state parks.
The duties of the Sussex County Sheriff&#x27;s Office include overseeing security at the county&#x27;s courthouse facilities, operating the county jail, and civil processes. The current sheriff is Michael F. Strada, a former officer with the Mount Olive Township police department.

==Media==

===Newspapers===

Sussex County has one daily newspaper, the &quot;New Jersey Herald&quot;, which is published six days each week (Sunday through Friday). Established in 1829 by Grant Fitch, the Herald is one of the oldest continuing newspapers in the state with distribution throughout Sussex County and into neighboring Morris and Warren counties in New Jersey, Orange County, New York and Pike County, Pennsylvania. Its headquarters, and production facilities are located in Newton, New Jersey. Its printing facilities were located in Newton, as well, but in 2012 the newspaper&#x27;s printing was outsourced to North Jersey Media Group, located in Rockaway, New Jersey.

It was for most of its existence published once per week. It&#x27;s Sunday edition, the &quot;New Jersey Sunday Herald&quot;, was first published on June 11, 1962, and for the next few years it was published twice weekly. In 1969, after a sale to American Newspapers, Inc., a daily edition was planned which began publication on March 16, 1970. American Newspapers, Inc. sold it to Quincy Newspapers in March 1980. Quincy later sold the newspaper to GateHouse Media in May 2019, and later that year, acquired Gannett and assumed its name in a merger. Today, its content includes coverage of local news and sporting events (chiefly those in Sussex County) and printing selected articles from the Associated Press covering state, national and international events.

===Television===

Sussex County is served by Optimum, a division of Altice USA, in Sparta, New Jersey. Optimum has offered channels for local access programming (channel 10) and for &quot;community bulletin boards&quot;. It offers two free Public Service Announcements or event advertisements for free to non-profit organizations in Sussex and Warren Counties.

WMBC-TV an independent television station owned by Mountain Broadcasting Corporation, is licensed to operate in Newton. It is recognized for providing Korean language programming in the New York metropolitan area but also offers English-language programs. Its studios are located in West Caldwell, New Jersey and its transmitter near Lake Hopatcong. Before 2009, it operated an analog transmission on virtual channel 63 (UHF-63) but has converted to broadcasting its signal on digital channel 18.

The New Jersey Public Broadcasting Authority maintains the license to operate a low-power translator (W36AZ) in Sussex Borough to broadcast the state&#x27;s public television station, NJTV. This station, which used to be the New Jersey Network (NJN), is operated by WNET.org, the parent company of New York City&#x27;s flagship public television stations, WNET and WLIW, through a subsidiary nonprofit organization, Public Media NJ.

===Roads and highways===
Sussex County is served by a number of roads connecting it to the rest of the state and to both Pennsylvania and New York. According to the county government, &quot;a vast majority of residents who use single occupant vehicles to travel outside the county for employment. Thus, the demand for public transportation in the county is minimal.&quot; Interstate 80 passes through the extreme southern tip of Sussex County solely in Byram. Interstate 84 passes just yards north of Sussex County, but never enters New Jersey. New Jersey&#x27;s Route 15, Route 23, Route 94, Route 181, Route 183, and Route 284 pass through the county, as does U.S. Route 206.

====Bridges====
Sussex County has two toll-bridge crossings over the Delaware River.

Operated by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, the Milford-Montague Toll Bridge (also known as the US 206 Toll Bridge) carries U.S. Route 206 over the Delaware connecting Montague Township and Milford, Pennsylvania. The current bridge was opened in 1954, replacing a series of bridges located here beginning in 1826. Route 206 merges with U.S. Route 209 a mile south of the village center. Tolls are collected only from motorists traveling westbound, into Pennsylvania, with cars paying a $1 toll; a total of $1.7 million was generated from 1.3 million vehicles in 2016.

The Dingman&#x27;s Ferry Bridge is the last privately owned toll bridge on the Delaware River and one of the last few in the United States. It is owned and operated by the Dingmans Choice and Delaware Bridge Company which has operated bridges at the site since 1836. The bridge connects the village of Dingmans in Delaware Township in Pike County, Pennsylvania and State Route 2019 with County Route 560 and the Old Mine Road in Sandyston Township.

===Commuter rail service===
, Sussex County&#x27;s sole operating railroad line is dedicated to freight service in Sparta, Vernon and Hardyston townships. It is operated by the New York, Susquehanna &amp; Western railroad and CSX Transportation. Commuter rail service has not been offered in the county since the 1960s. However, commuter rail service is available from nearby stations along NJ Transit&#x27;s Morris and Essex Lines in Hackettstown, Mount Olive, Netcong, Lake Hopatcong, Mount Arlington and Dover, which are easily accessible to Sussex County residents by driving or through bus services contracted by NJ Transit. This line was part of the former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad system. Service is available directly to Hoboken Terminal or via the Kearny Connection (opened in 1996) to Secaucus Junction and Pennsylvania Station in Midtown Manhattan. Passengers can transfer at Newark Broad Street Station or Summit to reach either New York or Hoboken.

NJ Transit is planning to re-open commuter service through the Lackawanna Cut-Off Restoration Project will allow train transport through Andover and Green Townships in the southern part of the county. Service from a planned station in Andover into New York City and Hoboken is scheduled to begin in 2019, marking the first time Sussex County has seen passenger trains since 1970. The portion of the Cut-Off route west of Andover heading toward Scranton, Pennsylvania has not been funded or scheduled, however Amtrak has announced plans for its restoration.

===Bus service===
NJ Transit in partnership with the county government offers bus service in Sussex County, limited to Monday-Saturday service on the &quot;Skylands Connect&quot; route between the Sussex-Wantage Library and Hampton Plaza in Newton, NJ. The county government&#x27;s Office of Transit also operates a ParaTransit bus service on weekdays to local senior citizens, veterans, people with disabilities, and the general public. It offers service within the county for local errands (nutrition, medical appointments, shopping, hairdresser appointments, banking, community services, education/training, and employment) and outside the county for non-emergency medical appointments (dialysis, therapy, radiation treatment, mental health, specialized hospitals, and Veterans facilities). NJ Transit also offers weekday service between New York City&#x27;s Midtown Port Authority Bus Terminal and Stockholm, and seasonal service to Vernon.

Lakeland Bus Lines, a privately operated commuter bus company based in Dover, in Morris County offers service under contract with NJ Transit between Newton and Sparta to New York City&#x27;s Midtown Port Authority Bus Terminal.

===Airports===
There are four general aviation public-use airports in Sussex County that cater to recreational pilots. They include: 
* Aeroflex-Andover Airport (FAA LID 12N) also in Andover Township. This airport is located in Kittatinny Valley State Park and is owned and operated by the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. It has one runway designated 3/21 and is located at and elevation of above mean sea level.
* Newton Airport (FAA LID 3N5) located in Andover Township and is privately owned. It has one runway with a 6/24 designation and is located at an elevation of above mean sea level. The Airport closed in 2013.
* Sussex Airport (FAA LID FWN) located in Wantage Township and is privately owned. It has a runway with a 3/21 designation and is located at an elevation of above mean sea level.
* Trinca Airport (FAA LID 13N) located in and owned by Green Township, which has a grass runway with a 6/24 designation and located at an elevation of above mean sea level.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary schools===

Before 1942, Sussex County had over 100 school districts. Most of these districts were in rural townships that each had several districts—each district operating a one-room schoolhouse that served their small neighborhoods. During the forty-year tenure (1903–1942) of County School Superintendent Ralph Decker, the local government began to consolidate these small districts into larger municipality-wide or regional school districts.

The public school system in Sussex County offers a &quot;thorough and efficient&quot; education for children between the ages of five and eighteen years (grades K–12), as required by state constitution, through nine local and regional public high school districts, and twenty public primary or elementary school districts. Because of its distance from other county high schools and the higher costs of busing students one of those locations, Montague Township (the northernmost municipality in the state) sends most of its middle school (grades 7–8) and high school students (grades 9–12) to Port Jervis, New York for schooling. However, in 2013, Montague began exploring alternatives that would involve keeping their students in-state by sending them to High Point Regional High School in neighboring Wantage Township. Several of the county&#x27;s schools are highly ranked by both state and federal education departments; some of which have achieved the U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon School Award. The county&#x27;s Board of County Commissioners oversees the Sussex County Technical School (formerly the Sussex County Vocational-Technical School), a county-wide technical high school in Sparta Township.

Pope John XXIII Regional High School in Sparta operates under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Paterson, which also operates Reverend George A. Brown Memorial School (PreK-4) and Pope John XXIII Middle School in Sparta. There are several other private schools in the county.

Sussex County&#x27;s 10 high schools compete in interscholastic sports and other athletic activities sanctioned by the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA). In 2009, the NJSIAA reorganized statewide athletic leagues into regional conferences. Prior to this reorganization, these schools competed under the auspices of the Sussex County Interscholastic League (SCIL), a now-defunct county-wide conference affiliated with NJSIAA. SCIL and other Morris and Warren County high schools compete under the NJSIAA&#x27;s Northwest Jersey Athletic Conference.

===Higher education===
Sussex County Community College (commonly referred to as &quot;SCCC&quot;), which opened in 1982, is an accredited, co-educational, two-year, public, community college located on a campus in Newton. The SCCC campus was the site of Don Bosco College, a Roman Catholic seminary operated by the Salesian Order from 1928 until it was closed in the early 1980s and its campus sold to the Sussex County government on June 22, 1989, for US$4,209,800.

SCCC was authorized as a &quot;college commission&quot; in 1981 and began operations the following year. It became fully accredited in 1993 by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. SCCC offers 40 associate degree and 16 post-secondary professional and health science certificate programs available both at traditional classes at its campus, through hybrid and online classes, and through distance learning. Many students who attend SCCC transfer to pursue the completion of their undergraduate college education at a four-year college or university. The college also offers programs for advanced high school students, community education courses, and programs in cooperation with the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development. , SCCC reported an enrollment of 2,738 students of which 55% attend full-time and 45% attended part-time.

Before it closed in 1995, Upsala College, a Lutheran-affiliated college in East Orange, New Jersey, operated a satellite campus in Wantage Township which it named the &quot;Wirth Campus&quot;. In 1978, the land known as &quot;Twin Ponds Farm&quot; had been donated by Wallace &quot;Wally&quot; Wirths (1921–2002), a former Westinghouse Corporation executive, author, local newspaper columnist and radio commentator. The school had considered moving to Sussex County as East Orange&#x27;s crime problem and social conditions deteriorated in the 1970s. However, declining enrollment and financial difficulties forced the school to close. The Wirths family bought back the farm for $75,000.

==Recreation==

Sussex County is part of the Skylands Region, a term promoted by the New Jersey Commerce, Economic Growth, &amp; Tourism Commission to encourage regional tourism. New Jersey ranks fifth in the nation in revenues generated from tourism.

===Agritourism===
Local dairy farmers have had to adapt to a declining milk and dairy industry and reacclimate to changing economic conditions by seeking new sources of revenue. Combining their agricultural production while promoting tourism, &quot;Agritourism&quot; has created opportunities for farmers. Many Sussex County farms offer corn field mazes, &quot;u-pick&quot; or &quot;pick your own&quot; fruits and vegetables—especially for apples, strawberries, pumpkins and Christmas trees during their respective harvest seasons.

New Jersey&#x27;s wine industry has benefited from the recent easing of state alcohol licensing laws and from new promotional and marketing programs offered by the state&#x27;s Department of Agriculture. Of the state&#x27;s 46 licensed wineries, Sussex County is home to three: Cava Winery &amp; Vineyard in Hamburg, Ventimiglia Vineyard in Wantage Township, and Westfall Winery in Montague Township.

===State and federal protected areas===

=== Libraries ===
The basement of the Sussex County Hall of Records was the home to the first official Sussex County Library when it opened its doors on May 15, 1942. A 1936 International book truck was used to mobilize the more than 8,000 books the library had amassed by the end of their first year. Today, the Sussex Library County System (SLCS) circulates over 600,000 items through its six branches.

The Main Library is located in Newton and is where all new materials are procured and then distributed to the five branch libraries. The five branch libraries are the Dennis Memorial Branch, named for Mr. Alfred L. Dennis who gifted a sum of $25,000 to build the first library (the Dennis Library) in the county in 1872. The Dorothy Henry Branch, located in Vernon, was renamed in 1981 after the passing of the county&#x27;s first librarian. The Franklin Branch, which opened in 1964, was the first official branch of the Sussex County Library System. The Louise Childs branch, located in Stanhope, opened in 1981 and was named in memory of Edith Louise Childs, who served for twenty-one years as Sussex County Clerk of the Board. Finally, the Sussex-Wantage branch which was formerly known as the Sussex Public Library, is located in Wantage.

The county&#x27;s six libraries supply residents with e-books, audiobooks, downloadable audio books, magazines and newspapers, DVDs, videogames, CDs and databases that cover subjects from alchemy to zoology. All six locations have computers with high-speed internet access, Wi-Fi, and meeting rooms available for use by the public.

===Skiing and winter sports===
In the 1960s, Vernon Township became a location for skiing and winter sports.
* Mountain Creek 
* Hidden Valley - Since January 2016, the area has been repurposed as the National Winter Activity Center, which provides education and ski / snowboard instruction to groups that might not have access to winter sports.

===Sports franchises===

Sussex County has one large venue for professional sports, Skylands Stadium, a 4,200-seat baseball stadium located in the Augusta section of Frankford Township near the intersection of U.S. Route 206, New Jersey Route 15, and County Route 565. In 2013, Skylands Park was acquired by investor Mark Roscioli Jr., of 17 Mile, LLC for $950,000. Roscioli, who admitted a lack of experience in sports management, then sold the facility to Al Dorso, who operates the annual State Fair Meadowlands., Dorso bought the facility with the intention of bringing baseball and other activities back to the stadium, which he achieved in late 2014 with the announcement of the Sussex County Miners, who began playing the following year.

With the rise of professional Minor League Baseball in the 1990s, Sussex County became the home to the New Jersey Cardinals, a Class A-Short Season affiliate of Major League Baseball&#x27;s St. Louis Cardinals franchise in 1994. The Cardinals, previously the Glens Falls Redbirds (1981–93) from upstate New York, won the New York–Penn League&#x27;s championship in their 1994 inaugural season. They had one other winning season (in 2002) and in 2005 the owners sold the team—which was then moved to University Park, Pennsylvania and renamed the State College Spikes. They are now affiliated with MLB&#x27;s Pittsburgh Pirates franchise. In 2006, Skylands Park became the home of the Sussex Skyhawks an affiliate of the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball (or Can-Am League). The team were League Champions during the 2008 season. The team ceased operations after the 2010 season.

Sussex was re-introduced to the Can-Am League in 2015, when the Miners began play that season. After experiencing growing pains their first three seasons, the Miners broke through in 2018 when they posted a 63–38 record and won the league championship in 2018. They appeared in the following championship the following season, but fell to the New Jersey Jackals, also owned by Dorso. After the 2019 season, the Miners, along with four other Can-Am teams, joined the Frontier League after the two independent leagues merged. The Miners began Frontier League play in 2021 after the league canceled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Sussex County Fairgrounds===
The Sussex County Farm and Horse Show in the Augusta of Frankford Township, which has operated since 1940, has been known as the New Jersey State Fair since 1999.

The fair grounds is also host to the Sussex County Poultry Fanciers Spring and Fall shows. In 2019 the Serama Council of North America (SCNA) will hold Jersey&#x27;s first ever SCNA Serama Table Top show

===Outdoor recreation===

==History==
===Etymology===
Somerset County is one of America&#x27;s oldest counties, and is named after the English county of Somerset. 

===History===
The area was first settled in 1681 in the vicinity of Bound Brook, and the county was established by charter on May 22, 1688. Most of the early residents were Dutch. 

During the American Revolutionary War, General George Washington and his troops marched through the county on several occasions and slept in many of the homes located throughout the area. Somerset County also played an important part during both World War I and World War II. Weapons depots were established here, and factories manufactured the army&#x27;s woolen blankets. For much of its history, Somerset County was primarily an agricultural county. In the late 19th century, the Somerset Hills area of Somerset County became a popular area for country homes built by wealthy industrialists. The area continues to be the home of wealthy people who own businesses. 

In 1917, Somerset County, in cooperation with Rutgers University, hired its first agricultural agent to connect local farmers with expert advice. The Rutgers Cooperative Extension of Somerset County, located in Bridgewater, serves residents in the areas of agriculture and natural resources, 4-H youth development, and family and community health sciences. In the 1960s, townships which were once exclusively agricultural were quickly developed as suburban residential communities. Examples include Bridgewater Township and the Watchung Hills communities of Watchung, Green Brook and Warren Township. The growth was aided by the development of the county&#x27;s very strong pharmaceutical and technology presence. Warren Township used to be considered &quot;the greenest place in New Jersey.&quot; More recently, there has been an influx of New York City commuters who use NJ Transit&#x27;s Raritan Valley Line and Gladstone Branch or use Interstate 78.

In 1996, Nicholas L. Bissell Jr., the county prosecutor, was charged with embezzlement, tax fraud, and abuse of power. He fled to Laughlin, Nevada southeast of Las Vegas, and killed himself when the federal authorities attempted to arrest him.

<text>Salem County is the westernmost county in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Its western boundary is formed by the Delaware River, and it has the eastern terminus of the Delaware Memorial Bridge, which connects the county with New Castle, Delaware. Its county seat is Salem. The county is part of the South Jersey region of the state.

The county lies within the Philadelphia metropolitan area, also known as the Delaware Valley area. As of the 2020 census, the county retained its position as the state&#x27;s least-populous county, with a population of 64,837, a decrease of 1,246 (−1.9%) from the 2010 census count of 66,083. The most populous place in Salem County is Pennsville Township with 12,684 residents as of the 2020 Census. Lower Alloways Creek Township covers , the largest total area of any municipality.

Salem County, along with adjacent Gloucester County, also in South Jersey, have become an East Coast epicenter for logistics and warehouse construction.

==History==
=== Etymology ===
The county derives its name from the Hebrew word shalom, which means &quot;peace&quot;, chosen by early Quaker settlers to mark the serenity of the area.

=== Early history ===
European settlement began with English colonists in the seventeenth century, who were settling both sides of the Delaware River. They established a colonial court in the area in 1681, but Salem County was first formally organized within West Jersey on May 17, 1694, from the Salem Tenth. Pittsgrove Township was transferred to Cumberland County in April 1867, but was restored to Salem County in February 1868. The area was initially settled by Quakers.

The Old Salem County Courthouse, located on the same block as the Salem County Courthouse, serves as the court for Salem City in the 21st century. It is the oldest active courthouse in New Jersey and is the second oldest courthouse in continuous use in the United States, the oldest being King William County Courthouse in Virginia. The courthouse was built in 1735 during the reign of King George II using locally manufactured bricks. The building was enlarged in 1817 and additionally enlarged and remodeled in 1908. Its distinctive bell tower is essentially unchanged and the original bell sits in the courtroom.

Judge William Hancock of the King&#x27;s Court presided at the courthouse. He was later killed by the British in the American Revolutionary War during the massacre at Hancock House committed by the British against local militia during the Salem Raid in 1778. Afterward the courthouse was the site of the &quot;treason trials&quot;, wherein suspected Loyalists were put on trial for having allegedly aided the British during the Salem Raid. Four men were convicted and sentenced to death for treason; however, they were pardoned by Governor William Livingston and exiled from New Jersey. The courthouse is also the site of the legend of Colonel Robert Gibbon Johnson&#x27;s proving the edibility of the tomato. Before 1820, Americans often assumed tomatoes were poisonous. In 1820, Colonel Johnson, according to legend, stood upon the courthouse steps and ate tomatoes in front of a large crowd assembled to watch him do so.

Salem County is notable for its distinctive Quaker-inspired architecture and masonry styles of the 18th century. It had a rural and agricultural economy. In the early 20th century, its towns received numerous immigrants from eastern and southern Europe, who markedly added to the population. In the period following World War II, the county&#x27;s population increased due to suburban development. To accommodate increasing traffic, the Delaware Memorial Bridge was built from Salem County to New Castle, Delaware.

===County government===

Salem County is governed by a five-member Board of Commissioners who are elected at-large to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year. At an annual reorganization meeting held at the beginning of January, the board selects a director and a deputy director from among its members. The appointed position professional county administrator was abolished by a unanimous vote of the commissioners in January 2014. In 2016, commissioners were paid $25,410 and the director was paid an annual salary of $26,410.

In the 2016 general election, Salem County voters approved a binding referendum to cut the number of Commissioner from seven to five as well as a non-binding referendum to cut Commissioner salaries by 20%; both initiatives, which had been placed on the ballot as the result of grassroots campaigns opposed to a proposed outsourcing deal, passed by a 3–1 margin. In the wake of the referendum results, Director Julie Acton resigned in December 2016 and was replaced by Scott Griscom. In April 2017, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the reduction in seats will be accomplished through attrition, with the seats expiring at the end of 2017 (held by Commissioners Cross, Painter, and Vanderslice) being eliminated; in the November 2017 general election there will be one new three-year seat up for a vote as well as a two-year unexpired term, so that on January 1, 2018, there will be a five-member board. Republicans have fully controlled the board since 2022.

In Passaic County&#x27;s commission form of government, the Board of County Commissioners discharges both executive and legislative responsibilities. Seven Commissioners are elected at-large for three-year terms on a staggered basis. A Director and Deputy Director are elected from among the seven Commissioners, at an annual reorganization meeting in January. Passaic County operates through six standing committees of the Board of County Commissioners. They are: Administration &amp; Finance; Health, Education and Community Affairs; Public Works and Buildings &amp; Grounds; Law &amp; Public Safety; Human Services and Planning and Economic Development. The Commissioners also appoint individuals to departments, agencies, boards, and commissions for the effective administration of the county government. In 2016, commissioners were paid $28,500, and the director was paid an annual salary of $29,500. The Commissioners select a County Administrator, who, in the role of chief administrative officer, supervises the day-to-day operation of the county government and its departments; County counsel Matthew Jordan took office as administrator in 2022, succeeding Anthony J. DeNova III, who had served as administrator for 19 years.

Republicans have not won countywide office since 2021. Nicolino Gallo&#x27;s 2021 third-place finish for the three Board seats at stake then represents the first time any Republicans have been in the county government since now-State Senator Kristin Corrado left her position as County Clerk to win that seat in 2017, as well as the first time the Board has had any Republican members at all since 2012, when then-Freeholders Deborah E. Ciambrone, Michael Marrotta, and Edward O&#x27;Connell were defeated. In March 2023, the commission swore Orlando Cruz, the president of the Greater Paterson Chamber of Commerce (as well as its counterpart in neighboring Wayne), into office to replace retiring commissioner T.J. Best, who resigned at the beginning of the month to spend time with family members down in Georgia.

== Politics==
Passaic County was historically a swing county, as it voted for the national winner all but twice (in 1976 and 1992) between 1920 and 1992. Since 1996, the county has leaned Democratic until recently, as Republicans have made significant gains in the country, especially in the more urban parts. In the 2016 presidential election, Democratic support declined to 59.5%, although nominee Hillary Clinton still won the county comfortably overall, and the 2020 presidential election saw Democratic support decline to 57.5% - a margin of 16.5% for former Vice President Joe Biden over Republican President Donald Trump, which was a slightly wider margin than the state as a whole. Passaic County&#x27;s namesake municipality, the small city of Passaic, saw the biggest overall drop for Biden compared to Clinton among its municipalities, which helped Trump narrow the gap in the county overall in 2020 compared to 2016:

2016: Clinton 12,275 (75%) - Trump 3,743 (22.8%) (all other candidates with 347 combined votes in the city - 2.2%)

2020: Biden 11,638 (62.5%) - Trump 6,835 (36.7%) (all other candidates with 162 combined votes in the city - 0.8%)

In the 2024 presidential election, Donald Trump flipped the county Republican, and most notably, its cities of Passaic and Clifton. This outcome was in correspondence with the rightward trend of the county in recent years, which was also seen in the 2021 gubernatorial election, and the nation in this election. Donald Trump became the first Republican to win a presidential election in the county since George H.W. Bush in the 1992 presidential election. As of August 1, 2020, there were a total of 318,029 registered voters in Passaic County, of which 128,114 (40.3%) were registered as Democrats, 64,389 (20.3%) were registered as Republicans and 120,282 (37.8%) were registered as Unaffiliated. There were 5,244 (1.7%) voters registered to other parties. Among the county&#x27;s 2010 Census population, 53.2% were registered to vote, including 70.8% of those ages 18 and over.

==History==


===Etymology===
Morris County was named after Colonel Lewis Morris, governor of New Jersey in 1738–39, the year the county was named.

===Paleo-Indians and Native Americans===
The Wisconsin Glacier covered the northern section of Morris County from about 23,000 BC to 13,000 BC.

After the Wisconsin Glacier melted around 13,000 BC, Paleo-Indians settled the area from the south in search of big and small game as well as plants. The area was first tundra with grasses growing. Rabbits and fox moved into the area from the south.

Around the year 1000, the area of Morris County was inhabited by the Lenape Native Americans prior to the arrival of European settlers. They came from the Mississippi River area. They lived along the rivers, hunted game, and fished in addition to collecting plants and nuts.

=== Dutch and English colonization ===
Henry Hudson explored the Hudson River area in 1609, and later the Dutch did surveys of the area.

From 1611 to 1614, the Dutch established the colony of New Netherland, which claimed territory between the 40th and 45th parallel north, a zone which included northern New Jersey. Dutch forts were established along the Hudson River beginning in 1613. As the years went by, more forts were established to trade with Native Americans.

The Native Americans traded furs and food with the Dutch for various goods. In return the Dutch gave the Native Americans metal pots, knives, guns, axes, and blankets. Trading with the Native Americans occurred until 1643 when a series of wars broke out between the Dutch and Native Americans.

There were hostile relations between the Dutch and Native Americans between 1643 and 1660. This prevented colonization by the Dutch of the Morris County region which was technically included in their claimed &quot;New Netherland&quot;.

On August 27, 1664, three English ships approached Fort Amsterdam and the fort was surrendered to the English. The English now controlled New Netherland and Morris County was now under control of the colony of New York. Relations with the Native Americans improved for a while.

There was a war with the Dutch ten years later. The Dutch re-took control of New Amsterdam but after a year returned it to the English. Relations with the Native Americans and English improved for a while.

European settlements began in the early 18th century while the area was known as Hunterdon County. Native Americans were still in the area at that time. Land was purchased from the Native Americans for various things such as blankets, shirts, rum, guns, knives, pots and gunpowder. European colonization began along the Atlantic coast moving inland.

The first European settlement in the area today known as Morris County occurred in Pompton Plains by the Dutch in 1695. From 1710 to 1730, various iron mines and forges were established. The first was in Whippany in 1710 and then in Succasunna in 1713.

By 1750, nearly all Native Americans had left New Jersey. This was due to land purchases from the Native Americans, diseases that the Native Americans contracted from Europeans, and due to starvation from the Little Ice Age, during which Native American corn crops failed and rivers froze, preventing fishing. Snow storms sent game into semi-hibernation or made them difficult to find. Nut crops such as oak, hickory, beech, walnut, chestnut and butternut failed some years due to late frosts in spring. Many of the Morris County Native Americans went to eastern Canada and others went to the Ohio Valley. The Walking Purchase in September 1737, prevented Native Americans from going to eastern Pennsylvania. At that time, European settlement grew swiftly as there was now land to be farmed and settled.

Morris County was originally part of Burlington County which had been established in 1694. It then became part of Hunterdon County, which separated from Burlington County in 1714.

Morris County was created on March 15, 1739, from portions of Hunterdon County. The county was named for the Governor of the Province of New Jersey, Colonel Lewis Morris. In later years Sussex County (on June 8, 1753) and, after the revolution, Warren County (on November 20, 1824, from portions of Sussex County) were carved out of what had been the original area of Morris County under English rule.

The county was the site of the winter camp of the Continental Army after the Battles of Trenton and Princeton during the winter of 1777, as well as another winter camp at Jockey Hollow during an extremely cold winter of 1779–80.

In the 1880s, Dover was the center of iron ore mining with the 132 mines producing 700,000 tons of ore annually. The mines were mostly worked by Cornish miners, with the bulk of the population in Dover and Port Oram of Cornish extraction. At that time the Cornish had kept their customs and dialect, were deeply religious and predominantly Methodists.

==Geography and geology==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of the 2020 Census, the county had a total area of , of which was land (95.7%) and was water (4.3%).

The county rises in elevation and relief from east to west, with only the more developed eastern suburbs in the Passaic River valley being relatively level. The highest point is at above sea level on a mountain south of Pine Swamp in western Jefferson Township. The second-highest point is on a mountain just north of Riker Lake at . The lowest point is about in elevation, at Two Bridges, the confluence of the Passaic and Pompton rivers.

The county is drained by several rivers. The Rockaway River drains , of the northern section of the county. The Whippany River drains of the middle of the county. The South Branch of the Raritan River and the Black River drain the western area.

Most of the county&#x27;s borders are rivers. The Pequannock River drains the northern boundary area. The Pompton River drains the eastern section. The Passaic River also drains the eastern border area. The western border is drained by the Musconetcong River. There are several large lakes in Morris County; among them are the state&#x27;s largest lake, Lake Hopatcong, Budd Lake, Lake Parsippany, and the Boonton Reservoir, also known as the Jersey City Reservoir.

===Climate===
Morris has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;/&quot;Dfb&quot;) and the hardiness zones are 6a and 6b.
===Weather===

In recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Morristown have ranged from a low of in January to a high of in July, although a record low of was recorded in February 1934 and a record high of was recorded in August 2001.

Around 500 million years ago, a chain of volcanic islands shaped like an arc collided with proto-North America. The islands rode over top of the North American plate. This created the highlands in western Morris County and the eastern section of Morris County.

Around 400 million years ago, a small continent long and narrow collided with proto-North America. This created folding and faulting, as compression occurred. Then around 350 million years ago, the African Plate collided with North America creating the folding and faulting in the Appalachians. But when the African plate pulled away from North America, an aborted rift valley was created. This half , starts east of Boonton and goes through the middle of Parsippany, south to Morristown, to the south end of Great Swamp. From Parsippany and the Boonton area the half graben goes east to the western side of Paterson, where there was another fault by the lava flows. East of the Ramapo Fault is where there is this aborted rift valley.

The Ramapo fault goes through the county on a northeast–southwest axis. The fault separates the Highlands from the Piedmont, also known as the Newark Basin. This is an active fault. The last major earthquake occurred in 1884, with a strength measured at 5.3 on the Richter scale.

Around 21,000 BCE., the Wisconsin Glacier covered about half of Morris County. The terminal moraine went from Hackettstown east to north of Budd Lake, east to Rockaway and Denville, then southeast to Morristown then south to the south end of Great Swamp. When the glacier melted around 13,000 B.C. the melt water created Glacial Lake Passaic. The lake extended from what is now Pompton Lakes through Parsippany south to the south end of Great Swamp. From Parsippany the lake went east to the lava flows of western Paterson. This lake was long and miles wide and the depth was about . When the Wisconsin glacier covered Morris County, the ice sheet was about deep. Due to debris from the glacier, the lake was unable to drain through the Watchung Mountains near Short Hills. Instead, it drained through Moggy Hollow at the southwestern end of the lake. But when the glacier melted and receded to the New York State line, the lake drained though the Little Falls area, as this was lower in elevation than Moggy Hollow. And thus the Passaic River formed.

The swamps of the Great Piece Meadows, Hatfield Swamp, Troy Meadows, Lee Meadows and Great Swamp were all under the Lake Passaic until it drained, and then these areas were created.

===Other===
The Morris Automated Information Network, which supplies Internet service to area libraries, turned down $10,000 per year in federal funding, starting in 2004. Acceptance of the grants would have required the network to install anti-porn content filters to comply with the Children&#x27;s Internet Protection Act. As these filters excluded legitimate information—such as pages with the word &quot;breast&quot; in online searches regarding &quot;breast cancer&quot;—the network declined to accept these grants.

Another organization having the power to affect the county budget without county governmental control is the Morris County Board of Taxation, (also called the Morris County Tax Board). &quot;[T]he freeholders, and county government in general, do not have control over tax board spending. ... [T]he tax board is an entity of state government, even though it submits expense vouchers to county government.&quot;

== Politics ==
Though New Jersey is mainly a Democratic state, Morris County has generally leaned towards the Republican Party. The GOP has carried the county in all but three presidential elections starting in 1896: in 1912, 1964, and 2020. Republicans hold every countywide elected office and all of the county&#x27;s seats in the state legislature. The last Democrat to win a county office was Commissioner Douglas Romaine in 1973. Cory Booker in 2020 became the first Democrat to win the county in a Senate election since Bill Bradley in 1984. In 2024, Donald Trump flipped the county back to Republican, and Republican Curtis Bashaw carried the county against Andy Kim in the simultaneous Senate election.

===Secession from Essex County===
The municipalities of western Essex County have discussed secession from the county, to create a new county or be annexed to Morris County, spurred mainly by a belief that tax policy benefits the poorer, urban, eastern portions of the county at the expense of the wealthier, more suburban municipalities in the western part of Essex County.&quot; 

Dating back to the 1960s, then-Livingston Mayor William Clark had urged the township to secede from Essex County to join neighboring Morris. Additionally, from 2001 to 2003, Millburn, Montclair and Roseland all held nonbinding ballot referendums on the issue. Then-Montclair mayor Robert J. Russo gave a statement in 2003 about secession, &quot;I&#x27;ve watched Essex County burden our people, with very little to show for it. We&#x27;re fiscally conservative here and socially progressive – and we&#x27;re finally rebelling.&quot;

<doc id="93435" wikidata="Q1152356" url="?curid=93435" title="Ninus">
<text>Ninus (), according to Greek historians writing in the Hellenistic period and later, was the founder of Nineveh (also called Νίνου πόλις &quot;city of Ninus&quot; in Greek), ancient capital of Assyria. The figure or figures with which he corresponds in Assyrian records is uncertain; an association or identification with Ninurta has been proposed. An identification with Shamshi-Adad I, Shamshi-Adad V, and/or a conflation of the two have also been suggested.

==In Hellenic historiography==
Many early accomplishments are attributed to Ninus, such as training the first hunting dogs, and taming horses for riding. For this accomplishment, he is sometimes represented in Greek mythology as a centaur.

The figures of King Ninus and Queen Semiramis first appear in the history of Persia written by Ctesias of Cnidus (c. 400 BC), who claimed, as court physician to Artaxerxes II, to have access to the royal historical records. Ctesias&#x27; account was later expanded on by Diodorus Siculus. Ninus continued to be mentioned by European historians (e.g. Alfred the Great), until knowledge of cuneiform enabled a more precise reconstruction of Assyrian and Babylonian history from the mid 19th century onwards.

He was said to have been the son of Belus or Bel, a name that may represent a Semitic title such as Ba&#x27;al, &quot;lord&quot; (the famous name of a &quot;god&quot; whom Elijah opposed in 1 Kings 17ff). According to Castor of Rhodes (&quot;apud Syncellus&quot; p. 167), his reign lasted 52 years, its commencement, according to Ctesias, corresponding to 2189 BC. He was reputed to have conquered the whole of western Asia in 17 years with the help of Ariaeus, king of Arabia, and to have founded the first empire, defeating the legendary kings Barzanes of Armenia (whom he spared) and Pharnus of Media (whom he had crucified). 
As the story goes, Ninus, having conquered all neighboring Asian countries apart from India and Bactriana, then made war on Oxyartes, king of Bactriana, with an army of nearly two million, taking all but the capital, Bactra. During the siege of Bactra, he met Semiramis, the wife of one of his officers, Onnes, whom he took from her husband and married. The fruit of the marriage was Ninyas, said to have succeeded Ninus.

Ctesias (as known from Diodorus) also related that after the death of Ninus, his widow Semiramis, who was rumored to have murdered Ninus, erected to him a temple-tomb, 9 stadia high and 10 stadia broad, near Babylon, where the story of Pyramus and Thisbe (Πύραμος; Θίσβη) was later based. She was further said to have made war on the last remaining independent monarch in Asia, king Stabrobates of India, but was defeated and wounded, abdicating in favour of her son Ninyas.

==Identifications==
A number of historians, beginning with the Roman Cephalion (c. AD 120) asserted that Ninus&#x27; opponent, the king of Bactria, was actually Zoroaster (or first of several to bear this name), rather than Oxyartes.

Ninus was first identified in the &quot;Recognitions&quot; (part of Clementine literature) with the biblical Nimrod, who, the author says, taught the Persians to worship fire. In many modern interpretations of the Hebrew text of &quot;Genesis&quot; 10, it is Nimrod, the son of Cush, who founded Nineveh, though other translations (e.g., the KJV) render the same passage as naming Ashur, son of Shem, as the founder of Nineveh.

More recently, the identification in &quot;Recognitions&quot; of Nimrod with Ninus (and also with Zoroaster, as in &quot;Homilies&quot;) formed a major part of Alexander Hislop&#x27;s thesis in the 19th century tract &quot;The Two Babylons&quot;.

==Historicity==
The decipherment of a vast quantity of cuneiform texts has allowed modern Assyriologists to piece together a more accurate history of Sumer, Akkad, Babylonia, Assyria, and Chaldea aa well as of the Levant, Anatolia and Ancient Iran. Ninus (like Nimrod) is not attested in any of the far older extensive king lists compiled by the Mesopotamians themselves, nor mentioned in any Mesopotamian literature, and is thus considered wholly fictional.

An Assyrian queen Shammuramat is known to be historical, and for five years from 811 BC ruled the Neo-Assyrian Empire as regent for her son Adad-nirari III, and had been the wife of Shamshi-Adad V, rather than having any conne tion to the fictional Ninus. The later Hellenic myths surrounding Semiramis are considered by some to be inspired by the novelty of a woman ruling what was the largest empire in history at that point.

==In culture==
The story of Ninus and Semiramis is narrated in a 1st-century AD Hellenistic romance called the &quot;Ninus Romance&quot;, the &quot;Novel of Ninus and Semiramis&quot;, or the &quot;Ninus Fragments&quot;. A scene from it is perhaps depicted in mosaics from Antioch on the Orontes.

In his 7th-century compendium, the &quot;Etymologiae&quot;, Isidore of Seville claimed that idolatry was the invention of Ninus, who had a gold statue made of his father Belus, which he worshipped. This claim was highly influential throughout the medieval period into the Early Modern.

Two major works from late-16th-century England refer to Ninus in passing. William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; has the story of Pyramus and Thisbe as a play-within-a-play. The actors constantly mispronounce the location &quot;Ninus&#x27; Tomb&quot; as &quot;Ninny&#x27;s Tomb,&quot; though they are corrected initially, and in vain, by &quot;director&quot; Peter Quince. At the same time, Edmund Spencer&#x27;s epic poem &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; refers to Ninus’ pride in Canto V, verse XLVIII:
:And after him old Ninus farre did pas
:In princely pompe, of all the world obayd
:There also was that mightie Monarch layd
:Low under all, yet above all in pride

In 1846 London, the Italian opera &quot;Nabucco&quot; by Giuseppe Verdi and Temistocle Solera was rewritten as &quot;Nino&quot; due to British censorship; to avoid depicting Biblical scenes, the enslaved Hebrews under Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar were changed to enslaved Babylonians under Assyrian King Ninus.
