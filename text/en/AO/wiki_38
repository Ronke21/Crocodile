<text>Patsy Cline (born Virginia Patterson Hensley; September 8, 1932 – March 5, 1963) was an American singer, songwriter and pianist. She is regarded as one of the most influential vocalists of the 20th century and was one of the first country music artists to cross over into pop music. Cline had several major hits during her eight-year recording career, including two number-one hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country and Western Sides chart.

Born in Winchester, Virginia, Cline&#x27;s first professional performances began in 1948 at local radio station WINC when she was 15. In the early 1950s, Cline began appearing in a local band led by performer Bill Peer. Various local appearances led to featured performances on Connie B. Gay&#x27;s &quot;Town and Country&quot; television broadcasts. She signed her first recording contract with the Four Star label in 1954, and had minor success with her earliest Four Star singles including &quot;A Church, a Courtroom, Then Goodbye&quot; (1955) and &quot;I&#x27;ve Loved and Lost Again&quot; (1956). In 1957 Cline made her first national television appearance on &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot;. After performing &quot;Walkin&#x27; After Midnight&quot;, the single became her first major hit on both the country and pop charts.

Cline&#x27;s further singles with Four Star Records were unsuccessful, although she continued performing and recording. In 1958, she relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, to further her career. Working with new manager Randy Hughes, Cline became a member of the Grand Ole Opry and then moved to Decca Records in 1960. Under the direction of producer Owen Bradley, her musical sound shifted and she achieved consistent success. The 1961 single &quot;I Fall to Pieces&quot; became her first to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. Cline was severely injured in an automobile accident, which caused her to spend a month in the hospital. After she recovered, her next single &quot;Crazy&quot; also became a major hit.

During 1962 and 1963, Cline had hits with &quot;She&#x27;s Got You&quot;, &quot;When I Get Through with You&quot;, &quot;So Wrong&quot; and &quot;Leavin&#x27; on Your Mind&quot;. She also toured and headlined shows with more frequency. On March 5, 1963, she was killed in a plane crash along with country musicians Cowboy Copas, Hawkshaw Hawkins, and manager Randy Hughes, during a flight from Kansas City, Missouri, back to Nashville.

Since her death, Cline has been cited as one of the most celebrated, respected, and influential performers of the 20th century. Her music has influenced performers of various styles and genres. She has also been seen as a forerunner for women in country music, being among the first to sell records and headline concerts. In 1973, she became the first female performer to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In the 1980s, Cline&#x27;s posthumous successes continued in the mass media. She was portrayed twice in major motion pictures, including the 1985 biopic &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; starring Jessica Lange. Several documentaries and stage shows about her have been made, including the 1988 musical &quot;Always...Patsy Cline&quot;. A 1991 box set of her recordings received critical acclaim. Her greatest hits album sold over 10 million copies in 2005. In 2011, Cline&#x27;s childhood home in Winchester was restored as a museum for visitors and fans to tour.

==Early life==

Virginia Patterson Hensley was born in Winchester, Virginia, on September 8, 1932, to Hilda Virginia (née Patterson) and Samuel Lawrence Hensley. Mrs. Hensley was only 16 years old at the time of Cline&#x27;s birth. Sam Hensley had been married before; Cline had two half siblings (aged 12 and 15) who lived with a foster family because of their mother&#x27;s death years before. After Cline, Hilda Hensley gave birth to Samuel Jr. (called John) and Sylvia Mae. Besides being called &quot;Virginia&quot; in her childhood, Cline was referred to as &quot;Ginny&quot;.

She temporarily lived with her mother&#x27;s family in Gore, Virginia, before relocating many times throughout the state. She lived in Frederick MD between 1952-1956. In her childhood, the family relocated where Samuel Hensley, a blacksmith, could find employment, including Elkton, Staunton, and Norfolk. When the family had little money, she would find work, including at an Elkton poultry factory, where her job was to pluck and cut chickens. The family moved often before finally settling in Winchester, Virginia, on South Kent Street. Cline would later report that her father sexually abused her. When confiding the abuse to friend Loretta Lynn, Cline told her, &quot;take this to your grave.&quot; Hilda Hensley would later report details of the abuse to producers of Cline&#x27;s 1985 biopic &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;.

At age 13, Cline was hospitalized with a throat infection and rheumatic fever. Speaking of the incident in 1957 she said, &quot;I developed a terrible throat infection and my heart even stopped beating. The doctor put me in an oxygen tent. You might say it was my return to the living after several days that launched me as a singer. The fever affected my throat and when I recovered I had this booming voice like Kate Smith&#x27;s.&quot; It was during this time she developed an interest in singing. She started performing with her mother in the local Baptist choir. Mother and daughter also performed duets at church social events. She also taught herself how to play the piano.

With the new performing opportunities, Cline&#x27;s interest in singing grew, and at the age of 14, she told her mother that she was going to audition for the local radio station. Her first radio performances were at WINC in the Winchester area. According to WINC&#x27;s radio disc jockey Joltin&#x27; Jim McCoy, Cline appeared in the station&#x27;s waiting room one day and asked to audition. McCoy was impressed by her audition performance, reportedly saying, &quot;Well, if you&#x27;ve got nerve enough to stand before that mic and sing over the air live, I&#x27;ve got nerve enough to let you.&quot; While performing on the radio, Cline also started appearing in talent contests and created a nightclub cabaret act similar to performer Helen Morgan&#x27;s.

Cline&#x27;s parents had marital conflicts during her childhood and by 1947 her father had deserted the family. Author Ellis Nassour of the biography &quot;Honky Tonk Angel: An Intimate Story of Patsy Cline&quot; reported Cline had a &quot;beautiful relationship&quot; with her mother. In his interviews with Hilda Hensley, he quoted Cline&#x27;s mother as saying they &quot;were more like sisters&quot; than parent and child. Cline attended the ninth grade at John Handley High School in Winchester, Virginia. However, the family had trouble sustaining an income after her father&#x27;s desertion, and Cline dropped out of high school to help support the family. She began working at Gaunt&#x27;s Drug Store in the Winchester area as a clerk and soda jerk.

==Career==
===1948–1953: Early career===
At age 15, Cline wrote a letter to the Grand Ole Opry asking for an audition. She told local photographer Ralph Grubbs about the letter, &quot;A friend thinks I&#x27;m crazy to send it. What do you think?&quot; Grubbs encouraged Cline to send it. Several weeks later, she received a return letter from the Opry asking for pictures and recordings. At the same time, Gospel performer Wally Fowler headlined a concert in her hometown. Cline convinced concert employees to let her backstage where she asked Fowler for an audition. Following a successful audition, Cline&#x27;s family received a call asking for her to audition for the Opry. She traveled with her mother, two siblings, and a family friend on an eight-hour journey to Nashville, Tennessee. With limited finances, they drove overnight and slept in a Nashville park the following morning. Cline auditioned for Opry performer Moon Mullican the same day. The audition was well-received and Cline expected to hear from the Opry the same day. However, she never received news and the family returned to Virginia.

By the early 1950s, Cline continued performing around the local area. In 1952, she asked to audition for local country bandleader Bill Peer. Following her audition, she began performing regularly as a member of Bill Peer&#x27;s Melody Boys and Girls. The pair&#x27;s relationship turned romantic, continuing an affair for several years. Nonetheless, the pair remained married to their spouses. Peer&#x27;s group played primarily at the Moose Lodge in Brunswick, Maryland where she would meet her first husband, Gerald Cline. Peer encouraged her to have a more appropriate stage name. She changed her first name from Virginia to Patsy (taken from her middle name &quot;Patterson&quot;). She kept her new last name, Cline. Ultimately, she became professionally known as &quot;Patsy Cline&quot;.

In August 1953, Cline was a contestant in a local country music contest. She won 100 dollars and the opportunity to perform as a regular on Connie B. Gay&#x27;s &quot;Town and Country Time&quot;. The show included country stars Jimmy Dean, Roy Clark, George Hamilton IV and Billy Grammer, and was filmed in Washington D.C. and Arlington County, Virginia. She was not officially added to the program&#x27;s television shows until October 1955. Cline&#x27;s television performances received critical acclaim. &quot;The Washington Star&quot; magazine praised her stage presence, commenting, &quot;She creates the moods through movement of her hands and body and by the lilt of her voice, reaching way down deep in her soul to bring forth the melody. Most female country music vocalists stand motionless, sing with monotonous high-pitched nasal twang. Patsy&#x27;s come up with a throaty style loaded with motion and E-motion.&quot;

===1954–1960: Four Star Records===
In 1954, Bill Peer created and distributed a series of demonstration tapes with Cline&#x27;s voice on it. A tape was brought to the attention of Bill McCall, president of Four Star Records. On September 30, 1954, she signed a two-year recording contract with the label alongside Peer and her husband Gerald Cline. The original contract allowed Four Star to receive most of the money for the songs she recorded. Therefore, Cline received little of the royalties from the label, totaling out to 2.34 percent on her recording contract. Her first recording session took place in Nashville, Tennessee on January 5, 1955. Songs for the session were handpicked by McCall and Paul Cohen. Four Star leased the recordings to the larger Decca Records. For those reasons Owen Bradley was chosen as the session&#x27;s producer, a professional relationship that would continue into the 1960s. Her first single release was 1955&#x27;s &quot;A Church, a Courtroom, Then Goodbye&quot;. Although Cline promoted it with an appearance on the Grand Ole Opry, the song was not successful.
Cline recorded a variety of musical styles while recording for Four Star. This included genres such as gospel, rockabilly, traditional country, and pop. Writers and music journalists have had mixed responses on Cline&#x27;s Four Star material. Robert Oermann and Mary Bufwack of &quot;Finding Her Voice: Women in Country Music&quot; called the label&#x27;s choice of material &quot;mediocre&quot;. They also commented that Cline seemed to have &quot;groped for her own sound on the label&quot;. Kurt Wolff of &quot;Country Music the Rough Guide&quot; commented that the music was &quot;sturdy enough, but they only hinted at the potential that lurked inside her. Richie Unterberger of &quot;Allmusic&quot; claimed it was Cline&#x27;s voice that made the Four Star material less appealing: &quot;Circumstances were not wholly to blame for Cline&#x27;s commercial failures. She would have never made it as a rockabilly singer, lacking the conviction of Wanda Jackson or the spunk of Brenda Lee. In fact, in comparison with her best work, she sounds rather stiff and ill-at-ease on most of her early singles.&quot;
Between 1955 and 1956, Cline&#x27;s four singles for Four Star failed to become hits. However, she continued performing regionally, including on the &quot;Town and Country Jamboree&quot;. In 1956, she appeared on ABC&#x27;s Country Music Jubilee, &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot;. It was at one of her local performances that she met her second husband, Charlie Dick. In 1956, Cline received a call to perform on &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot;, a national television show she had auditioned for several months prior. She accepted the offer, using her mother Hilda Hensley as her talent scout for the show. According to the show&#x27;s rules, talent scouts could not be family members. For those reasons, Cline&#x27;s mother lied in order to appear on the show. When Arthur Godfrey asked if Hensley had known Cline her entire life, she replied, &quot;Yes, just about!&quot;

Cline and Hensley flew into New York City&#x27;s LaGuardia Airport on January 18, 1957. She made her debut appearance on the program on January 21. The day of the show, she met with the show&#x27;s producer Janette Davis. Cline had chosen &quot;A Poor Man&#x27;s Roses (Or a Rich Man&#x27;s Gold)&quot; to perform on the program, but Davis preferred another song she had recorded, &quot;Walkin&#x27; After Midnight&quot;. Cline initially refused to perform it, but ultimately agreed to it. Davis also suggested Cline wear a cocktail dress instead of the cowgirl outfit created by her mother. She performed &quot;Walkin&#x27; After Midnight&quot; and won the program&#x27;s contest that night. The song had not yet been released as a single. In order to keep up with public demand, Decca Records rush-released the song as a single on February 11. The song ultimately became Cline&#x27;s breakthrough hit, peaking at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country and Western Sides chart. The song also reached number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop music chart. The song has since been considered a classic in country music since its release.

Music critics and writers have positively praised &quot;Walkin&#x27; After Midnight&quot;. Mary Bufwack and Robert Oermann called the song &quot;bluesy&quot;. Richie Unterberger noted &quot;it&#x27;s well-suited for the almost bemused aura of loneliness of the lyric.&quot; The success of &quot;Walkin&#x27; After Midnight&quot; brought Cline numerous appearances on shows and major networks. She continued working for Arthur Godfrey over the next several months. She also appeared on the Grand Ole Opry in February and the television program &quot;Western Ranch Party&quot; in March. The money she had earned from her numerous engagements totaled out to ten thousand dollars. Cline gave all the money to her mother, which she used to the pay the mortgage on her Winchester house. In August 1957, her debut studio album was released on Decca Records.

Cline&#x27;s follow-up singles to &quot;Walkin&#x27; After Midnight&quot; did not yield any success. This was partially due to the quality of material chosen for her to record. Cline was dissatisfied with the limited success following &quot;Walkin&#x27; After Midnight&quot;. Bradley recounted how she often came to him saying, &quot;Hoss, can&#x27;t you do something? I feel like a prisoner.&quot; Around the same time, Cline was fired from her regular slot on &quot;Town and Country Jamboree&quot;. According to Connie B. Gay, she ran late for shows and &quot;showed up with liquor on her breath.&quot; In September 1957, Cline married Charlie Dick and he was soon sent to Fort Bragg, North Carolina on a military assignment. Cline also gave birth to her first daughter Julie. In hopes of restarting her career, Cline and her family moved to Nashville, Tennessee.

===1960–1961: New beginnings and car accident===
Cline&#x27;s professional decisions yielded more positive results by the early 1960s. Upon moving to Nashville, she signed a management deal with Randy Hughes. She originally wished to work with Hubert Long, however, he was busy managing other artists. Instead, she turned her attention to Hughes. With the help of Hughes, she began working steadier jobs. He organized fifty dollar bookings and got her multiple performances on the Grand Ole Opry. In January 1960, Cline officially became a member of the Opry. When she asked general manager Ott Devine about a membership he replied, &quot;Patsy, if that&#x27;s all you want, you&#x27;re on the Opry.&quot; Also in January 1960, Cline made her final recording sessions set forth in her contract with Four Star Records. Later that year, her final singles with the label were released: &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot; and &quot;Crazy Dreams&quot;. Leaving Four Star, Cline officially signed with Decca Records in late 1960, working exclusively under Bradley&#x27;s direction. Insisting on receiving an advance, she received $1,000 from Bradley once she began at the label.

Her first release on Decca was 1961&#x27;s &quot;I Fall to Pieces&quot;. The song was written by newly established Nashville songwriters Hank Cochran and Harlan Howard. &quot;I Fall to Pieces&quot; had first been turned down by Roy Drusky and Brenda Lee before Cline cut it in November 1960. At the recording session, she worried about the song&#x27;s production, particularly the background vocals performed by The Jordanaires. After much arguing between both Cline and Bradley, they negotiated that she would record &quot;I Fall to Pieces&quot; (a song Bradley favored) and &quot;Lovin&#x27; in Vain&quot; (a song she favored). Released as a single in January 1961, &quot;I Fall to Pieces&quot; attracted little attention upon its initial issue. In April, the song debuted on the Hot Country and Western Sides chart. By August 7, the song became her first to top the country chart. Additionally, &quot;I Fall to Pieces&quot; crossed over onto the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop chart, peaking at number 12. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the No. 2 song for 1961 in the end of year charts.

On June 14, 1961, Cline and her brother Sam Hensley Jr. were involved in an automobile accident. Cline had brought her mother, sister and brother to see her new Nashville home the day before. On the day of the accident, Cline and her brother went shopping to buy material for her mother to make clothing. Upon driving home, their car was struck head-on by another vehicle. The impact threw her directly into the car windshield, causing extensive facial injuries. Among her injuries, Cline suffered a broken wrist, dislocated hip and a large cut across her forehead, barely missing her eyes. Friend Dottie West heard about the accident via the radio and rushed to the scene, helping to remove pieces of broken glass from Cline&#x27;s hair. When first responders arrived, Cline insisted the driver in the other vehicle be treated first. Two of the three passengers riding in the car that struck Cline died after arriving at the hospital. When she was brought to the hospital, her injuries were life-threatening and she was not expected to live. She underwent surgery and survived. According to her husband Charlie Dick, upon waking up she said to him, &quot;Jesus was here, Charlie. Don&#x27;t worry. He took my hand and told me, &#x27;No, not now. I have other things for you to do.&#x27;&quot; She spent a month recovering in the hospital.

===1961–1963: Career peak===
Cline returned to her career six weeks after her 1961 car accident. Her first public appearance was on the Grand Ole Opry where she assured fans she would continue performing. She said to the audience that night, &quot;You&#x27;re wonderful. I&#x27;ll tell you one thing: the greatest gift, I think, that you folks coulda given me was the encouragement that you gave me. Right at the very time I needed you the most, you came through with the flying-est colors. And I just want to say you&#x27;ll just never know how happy you made this ol&#x27; country gal.&quot;

Cline&#x27;s follow-up single to &quot;I Fall to Pieces&quot; was the song &quot;Crazy&quot;. It was written by Willie Nelson, whose version of the song was first heard by Dick. When Dick brought the song to Cline she did not like it. When Dick encouraged her to record &quot;Crazy&quot;, Cline replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t care what you say. I don&#x27;t like it and I ain&#x27;t gonna record it. And that&#x27;s that.&quot; Bradley liked the song and set the date for its recording for August 17. When Cline got to Bradley&#x27;s studio, he convinced her to record it. She listened to Nelson&#x27;s version of &quot;Crazy&quot; and decided she was going to perform it differently. Nelson&#x27;s version included a spoken section that Cline removed. She cut additional material on August 17 and when she got to &quot;Crazy&quot;, it became difficult to perform. Because Cline was still recovering from the accident, performing the song&#x27;s high notes caused rib pain. Giving her time to rest, Bradley sent her home while musicians laid down the track without her. A week later she returned and recorded her vocal in a single take.
&quot;Crazy&quot; was released as a single in October 1961, debuting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts in November. It would peak at number 2 there and number 9 on the same publication&#x27;s pop charts. &quot;Crazy&quot; would also become Cline&#x27;s biggest pop hit. Her second studio album &quot;Patsy Cline Showcase&quot; was released in late 1961. The album featured both major hits from that year and re-recorded versions of &quot;Walkin&#x27; After Midnight&quot; and &quot;A Poor Man&#x27;s Roses (Or a Rich Man&#x27;s Gold)&quot;.

&quot;Crazy&quot; has since been called a country music standard. Cline&#x27;s vocal performance and the song&#x27;s production have received high praise over time. Cub Koda of AllMusic noted the &quot;ache&quot; in her voice that makes the song stand out: &quot;Cline&#x27;s reading of the lyric is filled with an aching world weariness that transforms the tune into one of the first big crossover hits without even trying hard.&quot; Country music historian Paul Kingsbury also highlighted her &quot;ache,&quot; saying in 2007, &quot;Cline&#x27;s hit recording swings with such velvety finesse, and her voice throbs and aches so exquisitely, that the entire production sounds absolutely effortless.&quot; Jhoni Jackson of &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; called the recording &quot;iconic&quot;, highlighting the emotional &quot;pain&quot; Cline expressed in her voice.

&quot;Crazy&quot; and Cline&#x27;s further Decca recordings have received critical praise. Mary Bufwack and Robert Oermann noted &quot;Her thrilling voice invariably invested these with new depth. Patsy&#x27;s dramatic volume control, stretched-note effects, sobs, pauses and unique ways of holding back, then bursting into full-throated phrases also breathed new life into country chestnuts like &quot;San Antonio Rose&quot;, &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot;, and &quot;Half as Much&quot;. Richie Unterberger of AllMusic commented that her voice &quot;sounded richer, more confident, and more mature, with ageless wise and vulnerable qualities that have enabled her records to maintain their appeal with subsequent generations.&quot; Kurt Wolff of &quot;Country Music the Rough Guide&quot; reported that Owen Bradley recognized potential in Cline&#x27;s voice and once he gained studio control, he smoothed arrangements and &quot;refined her voice into an instrument of torch-singing glory.&quot;
In November 1961, she was invited to perform as part of the Grand Ole Opry&#x27;s show at Carnegie Hall in New York City. She was joined by Opry stars Minnie Pearl, Grandpa Jones, Jim Reeves, Bill Monroe, Marty Robbins, and Faron Young. Despite positive reviews, &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; columnist Dorothy Kilgallen commented, &quot;everybody should get out of town because the hillbillies are coming!&quot; The comment upset Cline but did not affect ticket sales; the Opry performance sold out. By the end of year, Cline had won several major industry awards including &quot;Favorite Female Vocalist&quot; from &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; and &quot;Cashbox Magazine&quot;″s &quot;Most Programmed Female Artist&quot;.

Also in 1961, Cline was back in the studio to record an upcoming album. Among the first songs she recorded was &quot;She&#x27;s Got You&quot;. Written by Hank Cochran, he pitched the song to Cline over the phone. Insisting that Patsy hear it in-person, Cochran brought the recording over to her house, along with a bottle of alcohol. Upon listening to it again, she liked the song and wanted to record it. Owen Bradley also liked the song and she recorded it on December 17, 1961. &quot;She&#x27;s Got You&quot; became her third country-pop crossover hit by early 1962. &quot;She&#x27;s Got You&quot; would also be her second number 1 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. It was also Cline&#x27;s first entry in the United Kingdom singles chart, reaching number 43. The cover by Alma Cogan, one of Britain&#x27;s most popular female artists of the 1950s, performed notably as well.

In 1962, Cline had three major hits with &quot;When I Get Through with You, &quot;So Wrong&quot;, and &quot;Imagine That&quot;. Cline&#x27;s career successes helped her become financially stable enough to purchase her first home. She bought a ranch house located in Goodlettsville, Tennessee, a suburb of Nashville. The home was decorated by Cline and included a music room, several bedrooms and a large backyard. According to Dottie West, &quot;the house was her mansion, the sign she&#x27;d arrived.&quot; Cline called it her &quot;dream home&quot; and often had friends over to visit. After her death, the house was sold to country artist Wilma Burgess.

In the summer of 1962, manager Randy Hughes got her a role in a country music vehicle film. It also starred Dottie West, Webb Pierce and Sonny James. After arriving to film in DeLand, Florida, the producer &quot;ran off with the money,&quot; according to West. The movie was never made. In August, her third studio album &quot;Sentimentally Yours&quot; was released. It featured &quot;She&#x27;s Got You&quot;, as well as several country and pop standards. According to biographer Ellis Nassour, her royalties &quot;were coming in slim&quot; and she needed &quot;financial security.&quot; Therefore, Randy Hughes arranged Cline to work at the Merri-Mint Theatre in Las Vegas, Nevada for 35 days. Cline would later dislike the experience. During the engagement, she developed a dry throat. She also was homesick and wanted to spend time with her children. By appearing at the engagement, Cline became the first female country artist to headline her own show in Las Vegas.

During this period Cline was said to have experienced premonitions of her own death. Dottie West, June Carter Cash, and Loretta Lynn recalled Cline telling them she felt a sense of impending doom and did not expect to live much longer. In letters, she would also describe the happiness of her new career successes. In January 1963, her next single &quot;Leavin&#x27; on Your Mind&quot; was released and debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart soon after. In February, she recorded her final sessions for Decca Records. Among the songs recorded were &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, &quot;He Called Me Baby&quot;, and &quot;Faded Love&quot;. Cline arranged for friends Jan Howard and Dottie West to come and hear the session playbacks. According to Howard, &quot;I was in awe of Patsy. You know, afterward you&#x27;re supposed to say something nice. I couldn&#x27;t talk. I was dumbfounded.&quot;

==Personal life==
===Friendships===

Cline had close friendships with several country artists and performers. Her friendship with Loretta Lynn has been the subject of numerous books, songs, films and other projects. The pair first met when Lynn performed &quot;I Fall to Pieces&quot; on the radio shortly after Cline&#x27;s 1961 car accident. Cline heard the broadcast and sent her husband to pick up Lynn so they could meet. According to Lynn, the pair became close friends &quot;right away.&quot; Lynn later described their friendship in detail, &quot;She taught me a lot about show business, like how to go on a stage and how to get off. She even bought me a lot of clothes... She even bought me curtains and drapes for my house because I was too broke to buy them... She was a great human being and a great friend.&quot; Lynn also noted they became so close that Cline even gave her underwear. .

Dottie West was another female country artist with whom Cline became friends. They first met backstage at the Grand Ole Opry. West wrote Cline a fan letter after hearing her first hit &quot;Walkin&#x27; After Midnight&quot;. According to West, Cline &quot;showed a genuine interest in her career&quot; and they became close friends. The pair often spent time at their homes and worked on packaged tour dates together. West also stated Cline was a supportive friend who helped out in times of need.

Jan Howard was a third female artist with whom Cline had a close friendship. The pair first met when Cline tried starting an argument with Howard backstage at the Grand Ole Opry. She said to Howard, &quot;You&#x27;re a conceited little son of a bitch! You just go out there, do your spot, and leave without saying hello to anyone.&quot; Howard was upset and replied angrily back. Cline then laughed and said, &quot;Slow down! Hoss, you&#x27;re all right. Anybody that&#x27;ll stand there and talk back to the Cline like that is all right...I can tell we&#x27;re gonna be good friends!&quot; The pair remained close for the remainder of Cline&#x27;s life. Other friendships Cline had with female artists included Brenda Lee, Barbara Mandrell and pianist Del Wood. She also became friends with male country artists including Roger Miller, who helped Cline find material to record. Faron Young was another male artist whom Cline befriended from working on tour together. While on tour, the pair would spend time together, including a trip to Hawaii where the pair saw a hula show.

===Family===
Cline&#x27;s mother Hilda Hensley continued living in Winchester, Virginia, following her daughter&#x27;s death. She rented out the family&#x27;s childhood home on South Kent Street and lived across the street. Following Cline&#x27;s death, Hensley briefly spent time raising her two grandchildren in Virginia. Hensley maintained a closet full of her daughter&#x27;s stage costumes, including a sequined dress Cline wore while performing in Las Vegas in 1962. She worked as a seamstress and made many of her daughter&#x27;s stage costumes. 

Cline&#x27;s father Samuel Hensley died of lung cancer in 1956. Hensley had deserted the family in 1947. Shortly before his death, upon learning that he was gravely ill, Cline said to her mother, &quot;Mama, I know what-all he did, but it seems he&#x27;s real sick and may not make it. In spite of everything, I want to visit him.&quot; Cline and her mother visited him at a hospital in Martinsburg, West Virginia.

Cline&#x27;s mother died in 1998, 35 years after Cline&#x27;s death. Both of Cline&#x27;s surviving siblings fought in court over their mother&#x27;s estate. Because of legal fees, many of Cline&#x27;s possessions were sold at auction.

Cline had two surviving children at the time of her death: Julie Simadore and Allen Randolph &quot;Randy&quot;. Julie has been a significant factor in keeping her mother&#x27;s legacy alive. She has appeared at numerous public appearances in support of her mother&#x27;s music and career. Following the death of her father in 2015, she helped open a museum dedicated to Cline in Nashville, Tennessee. Julie has few memories of her mother due to Cline&#x27;s death while she was young. In an interview with &quot;People Magazine&quot;, Julie discussed her mother&#x27;s legacy, &quot;I do understand her position in history, and the history of Nashville and country music...I&#x27;m still kind of amazed at it myself, because there&#x27;s &#x27;Mom&#x27; and then there&#x27;s &#x27;Patsy Cline,&#x27; and I&#x27;m actually a fan.&quot;

The present-day American female blues, swing, and rock and roll singer, songwriter and record producer Casey Hensley is a distant relation of Cline&#x27;s.

===Marriages===
Cline was married twice. Her first marriage was to Gerald Cline, on March 7, 1953. His family had owned a contracting and excavating company in Frederick, Maryland. According to Cline&#x27;s brother Sam, he liked &quot;flashy cars and women.&quot; The two met while she was performing with Bill Peer at the Moose Lodge in Brunswick, Maryland. Gerald Cline said, &quot;It might not have been love at first sight when Patsy saw me, but it was for me.&quot; Gerald Cline often took her to &quot;one-nighters&quot; and other concerts she performed in. Although he enjoyed her performances, he could not get used to her touring and road schedule. During their marriage, Patsy told a friend that she didn&#x27;t think she &quot;knew what love was&quot; upon marrying Gerald. The pair began living separately by the end of 1956 and divorced in 1957.

Cline married her second husband Charlie Dick on September 15, 1957. The pair met in 1956 while Cline was performing with a local Virginia band. At the time, Dick was a linotype operator for a local newspaper, &quot;The Winchester Star&quot;. According to Dick, he had asked Cline to dance, and she replied, &quot;I can&#x27;t dance while I&#x27;m working, okay?&quot; They eventually started spending time together, and Cline told close friends about their relationship. Cline told Grand Ole Opry pianist Del Wood in 1956, &quot;Hoss, I got some news. I met a boy my own age who&#x27;s a hurricane in pants! Del, I&#x27;m in love, and it&#x27;s for real this time.&quot; The pair had children Julie and Randy together. Their relationship was considered both romantic and tempestuous. According to Robert Oermann and Mary Bufwack, Cline and Dick&#x27;s marriage was &quot;fueled by alcohol, argument, passion, jealousy, success, tears, and laughter.&quot;

According to biographer Ellis Nassour, the pair fought often but remained together. They had gained a reputation as &quot;heavy drinkers&quot;, but according to Dick himself, they were not &quot;drunks&quot;. During one particular fight, Cline had Dick arrested after they became physical with one another. Following Cline&#x27;s death in 1963, Dick married country artist Jamey Ryan in 1965. The pair divorced in the early 1970s after having one child together. Dick helped keep Cline&#x27;s legacy alive for the remainder of his life. He assisted in producing several documentaries about Cline&#x27;s career, including &quot;Remembering Patsy&quot; and &quot;The Real Patsy Cline&quot;. He became involved with Hallway Productions in the 1990s and helped produce videos on other artists, including Willie Nelson and The Mamas and the Papas. Dick died in 2015 and was laid to rest next to Cline.

==Death==


On March 3, 1963, Cline performed a benefit at the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, Kansas City, Kansas, for the family of disc jockey &quot;Cactus&quot; Jack Call; he had died in an automobile crash a little over a month earlier. Also performing in the show were George Jones, George Riddle and The Jones Boys, Billy Walker, Dottie West, Wilma Lee and Stoney Cooper, George McCormick, the Clinch Mountain Boys as well as Cowboy Copas and Hawkshaw Hawkins. Despite having a cold, Cline performed at 2:00, 5:15, and 8:15 pm. All the shows were standing-room only. For the 2 p.m. show, she wore a sky-blue tulle-laden dress; for the 5:15 show, a red dress; and for the closing show at 8 p.m., Cline wore white chiffon. Her final song was the last she had recorded the previous month, &quot;I&#x27;ll Sail My Ship Alone&quot;.

Cline, who had spent the night at the Town House Motor Hotel, was unable to fly out the day after the concert because Fairfax Airport was fogged in. West asked Patsy to ride in the car with her and her husband, Bill, back to Nashville, an 8-hour drive, but Cline refused, saying: &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about me, Hoss. When it&#x27;s my time to go, it&#x27;s my time.&quot; On March 5, she called her mother from the motel and checked out at 12:30 p.m., going the short distance to the airport and boarding a Piper PA-24 Comanche plane, aircraft registration number N7000P. On board were Cline, Copas, Hawkins, and pilot Randy Hughes.

The plane stopped once in Rogers, Arkansas, to refuel and subsequently landed at Dyersburg Municipal Airport in Dyersburg, Tennessee, at 5 p.m. Hawkins had accepted Billy Walker&#x27;s place after Walker left on a commercial flight to take care of a stricken family member. The Dyersburg, Tennessee, airfield manager suggested they stay the night because of high winds and inclement weather, offering them free rooms and meals. But Hughes, who was not trained in instrument flying, said, &quot;I&#x27;ve already come this far. We&#x27;ll be there before you know it.&quot; The plane took off at 6:07 p.m.

However, the plane crashed in heavy weather on the evening of March 5, 1963. Cline&#x27;s recovered wristwatch had stopped at 6:35 p.m. The plane was found some from its Nashville destination, in a forest outside of Camden, Tennessee. Forensic examination concluded that everyone aboard had been killed instantly. Patsy Cline was 30 years old. Until the wreckage was discovered the following dawn and reported on the radio, friends and family had not given up hope. Endless calls tied up the local telephone exchanges to such a degree that other emergency calls had trouble getting through. The lights at the aircraft&#x27;s destination, Cornelia Fort Airpark, were kept on throughout the night, as reports of the missing plane were broadcast on radio and TV.
Early in the morning, Roger Miller and a friend went searching for survivors: &quot;As fast as I could, I ran through the woods screaming their names—through the brush and the trees—and I came up over this little rise, oh, my God, there they were. It was ghastly. The plane had crashed nose down.&quot; Shortly after the bodies were removed, looters scavenged the area. Some recovered items were eventually donated to the Country Music Hall of Fame. Cline&#x27;s wristwatch, a Confederate flag cigarette lighter, a studded belt, and three pairs of gold lamé slippers were among them. Cline&#x27;s payment in cash from the last performance was never recovered. Per her wishes, Cline&#x27;s body was brought home first for her memorial service. Thousands attended the service. People jammed against the small tent over her gold casket and the grave to take all the flowers they could reach as keepsakes. She was buried at Shenandoah Memorial Park in her hometown of Winchester, Virginia. Her grave is marked with a bronze plaque, which reads: &quot;Virginia H. Dick (&#x27;Patsy Cline&#x27; is noted under her name) &#x27;Death Cannot Kill What Never Dies: Love&#x27;.&quot; A memorial marks the exact place off Mt Carmel Road in Camden, Tennessee, where the plane crashed.

==Posthumous releases==
===Music===
Since Cline&#x27;s death, Decca Records (later MCA) has re-released her much of her music. &quot;The Patsy Cline Story&quot; was the first compilation album the label released following her death. It included the songs &quot;Sweet Dreams (Of You)&quot; and &quot;Faded Love&quot;. Both tracks were released as singles in 1963. &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; would reach number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts and 44 on the Hot 100. &quot;Faded Love&quot; would also become a top 10 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart, peaking at number 7 in October 1963. In 1967, Decca released the compilation &quot;Patsy Cline&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;. The album peaked at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart, and was certified diamond in sales from the Recording Industry Association of America. In 2005, the Guinness World Book of Records cited Cline&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album as being the longest charting album of any female vocalist of any genre of music.
In 1980, Cline&#x27;s version of &quot;Always&quot; with new music tracks, made the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart; peaking at #18.. An album of the same name was also released in 1980 that peaked within the top 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart. Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves had never sang together but had recorded several of the same songs. Their separate vocal tracks were dubbed together on two selections. These became radio hits during the early 1980s. Following the release of the Loretta Lynn biopic &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1980), there was renewed interest in Cline&#x27;s career. As a result, MCA Records reissued much of Cline&#x27;s earlier studio and compilation releases. Her 1967 greatest hits album was repackaged in 1988 and labeled &quot;12 Greatest Hits&quot;. The record reached number 27 on the Top Country Albums list in 1990. The soundtrack for the controversial &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; was released in 1985. It peaked at number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart.

In 1991, MCA records issued her first boxed set, titled &quot;The Patsy Cline Collection&quot;. The album chronicled all of Cline&#x27;s recorded material for Four Star and Decca Records. The boxed set received positive reviews, notably by Thom Jurek of &quot;Allmusic&quot;, who rated it five out of five stars. Jurek commented, If an artist ever deserved a box set chronicling her entire career, it is Patsy Cline. Having recorded 102 sides between 1955 and her death at the age of 30 in 1963, Cline changed not only country music forever, but affected the world of pop as well. Over four CDs, arranged chronologically, the listener gets treated to a story in the development and maturation of a cultural icon who was at least, in terms of her gift, the equal of her legend. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed the box set among their &quot;Women Who Rock: 50 Greatest Albums of All-Time&quot; list. Writer Rob Sheffield called Cline &quot;a badass cowgirl drama queen belts some of the torchiest, weepiest country songs ever, hitting high notes that make you sob into your margarita.&quot; &quot;The Patsy Cline Collection&quot; would reach number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart in January 1992. In 1997, MCA released &quot;Live at the Cimarron Ballroom&quot;, a rare recording that had recently resurfaced. Jeweler Bill Frazee had originally purchased a tape in 1975 that he discovered included Cline&#x27;s live recording, which took place during July 1961, following Cline&#x27;s car accident. She appeared at the Cimarron Ballroom in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to give a one-night performance. Included on the record was unreleased live performances and dialog with the audience. The album peaked in the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart. Cline&#x27;s former MCA label (now MCA Nashville) continues releasing material to this day. Cline is listed among the Recording Industry of America&#x27;s bestselling artists, with a total of over 14 million records sold to date.

===Film and television===

Cline has been portrayed on film and television several times since the 1980s. The Loretta Lynn biopic &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1980) renewed interest in her life and career. Cline and Lynn&#x27;s friendship was portrayed in the 1980 film. Actress Beverly D&#x27;Angelo played Cline in the movie and did her own singing of Cline&#x27;s original material. D&#x27;Angelo earned a Golden Globe award nomination for her role. In an interview D&#x27;Angelo did for a 2017 PBS documentary, playing the role of Patsy Cline &quot;had a profound impact&quot; on her life and career.

In 1985, a feature film about Cline&#x27;s life was released entitled &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;. The film starred Jessica Lange as Cline and Ed Harris as husband Charlie Dick. Originally, Meryl Streep auditioned for Cline&#x27;s role but ultimately lost to Lange. The film was produced by Bernard Schwartz, who also produced &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. Original ideas called for scenes between Cline and Lynn; however, those scenes were ultimately removed from the final script. The film has been criticized for its lack of accuracy to Cline&#x27;s own life and its musical production. Kurt Wolff wrote, &quot;the soundtrack, however, featured overdubbed versions of Cline&#x27;s material – better to stick with the originals.&quot; Mark Deming of &quot;Allmovie&quot; only gave the release two out of five stars. Deming commented, &quot;While it&#x27;s a wise approach to show how her turbulent marriage paralleled her crossover to Countrypolitan ballads, the melodrama tends to overshadow the celebrity story by relegating her rise to stardom to the background. Due to the historically dubious concerts at carnivals and fairgrounds, it appears as though she wasn&#x27;t as big a star as she actually was.&quot; Deming did praise Lange&#x27;s performance saying she created a &quot;cheerful and spirited&quot; depiction of Cline. Roger Ebert gave it two stars in his original 1985 review. Ebert said, &quot;There isn&#x27;t the sense of a well-shaped structure in this movie; there&#x27;s no clear idea of what the filmmakers thought about Patsy Cline, or what thoughts her life is supposed to inspire.&quot; Lange was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role as Cline.

Cline was also portrayed in television films. In 1995, a film about the life and career of Cline&#x27;s friend Dottie West debuted on CBS titled, &quot;Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story&quot;. It included several scenes that showcased West&#x27;s friendship with Cline. Actress Tere Myers played her in the television movie. Deborah Wilker of the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; called her performance &quot;terrific&quot; and authentic.

Lifetime aired an original television film &quot;Patsy &amp; Loretta&quot; in October 2019 on the network. It chronicles Cline&#x27;s friendship with Loretta Lynn. Cline is portrayed by Megan Hilty and Lynn by Jessie Mueller. The film is directed by the Academy Award-winning screenwriter Callie Khouri. The trailer for the movie was released in July 2019. &quot;Patsy &amp; Loretta&quot; was filmed on location in Nashville, Tennessee and is co-produced by Lynn&#x27;s daughter and Cline&#x27;s daughter, Julie Fudge.

There have been several documentaries made about Cline&#x27;s life and career. The first was a 1989 documentary titled &quot;The Real Patsy Cline&quot;, which featured interviews with friends and fellow artists. This included Carl Perkins and Willie Nelson. Another documentary was filmed in 1994 entitled &quot;Remembering Patsy&quot;. The show was hosted by country artist Michelle Wright, who read letters Cline wrote to friends and family. It included interviews with several artists such as Roy Clark, George Jones and Trisha Yearwood. Both documentaries were produced by Cline&#x27;s widower Charlie Dick. In March 2017, PBS released a documentary on Cline as part of their &quot;American Masters&quot; series. The film was narrated by Rosanne Cash and featured interviews with fans of Cline. These interviews included Beverly D&#x27;Angelo and Reba McEntire. It also included rare performances of songs such as &quot;Three Cigarettes in an Ashtray&quot; and &quot;Walkin&#x27; After Midnight&quot;.

===Plays and musicals===
Cline&#x27;s life and career has also been re-created in the theater sector. In 1988, the show &quot;Always...Patsy Cline&quot; premiered. The show was created by Ted Swindley who derived it from a friendship Cline had with Texas resident Louise Seger. The pair met while Cline was performing at the Esquire Ballroom in Houston, Texas. Seger brought Cline home following the show and they spent the night together. The pair would remain in contact through letters before Cline&#x27;s death. Much of the script relied from letters exchanged between the two during the course of several years. Seger acts as the show&#x27;s narrator and revisits memories she shared with Cline through their letter exchanges. Among the show&#x27;s original performers was Mandy Barnett, who debuted the show at the Ryman Auditorium in 1994. Barnett would go on to have a music and performing career. A second musical was later released in 1991 titled &quot;A Closer Walk with Patsy Cline&quot;. The show was written by Dean Regan and has been called a &quot;musical retelling&quot; of Cline&#x27;s career.

==Artistry==
===Influences===
Cline was influenced by various music artists. Among her earliest influences were pop singers of the 1940s and 1950s. These included Kay Starr, Helen Morgan, Patti Page, and Kate Smith. Patti Page recollected that Cline&#x27;s husband said to her, &quot;I just wish Patsy could have met you because she just adored you and listened to you all the time and wanted to be like you.&quot; Among her primary influences was Kay Starr, of whom Cline was a &quot;fervent devotee&quot; according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Jack Hurst of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; remarked that &quot;Her rich, powerful voice, obviously influenced by that of pop&#x27;s Kay Starr, has continued and perhaps even grown in popularity over the decades.&quot; Cline was also attracted to country music radio programs, notably the Grand Ole Opry. According to Mary Bufwack and Robert Oermann, Cline became &quot;obsessed&quot; with the program at a young age. Cline&#x27;s mother Hilda Hensley commented on her daughter&#x27;s admiration, &quot;I know she never wanted anything so badly as to be a star on the Grand Ole Opry...&quot; Among performers from the program she admired was Patsy Montana. Cline was also influenced by other types of performers including early rockabilly artist Charline Arthur.

===Voice and style===
Cline possessed a contralto voice. &quot;Time&quot; magazine writer Richard Corliss called her voice &quot;bold&quot;. Her voice has also been praised for its display of emotion. Kurt Wolff called it one of the most &quot;emotionally expressive voices in modern country music&quot;. Tony Gabrielle of the &quot;Daily Press&quot; wrote that Cline had &quot;a voice of tremendous emotional power.&quot; Cline was at times taken by her own emotion. Husband Charlie Dick recounted that Cline&#x27;s producer Owen Bradley told him to leave a recording session because she was very emotional and he didn&#x27;t want to disturb the mood. Cline was once quoted in describing the emotion she felt, saying, &quot;Oh Lord, I sing just like I hurt inside.&quot;

During her early career, Cline recorded in styles such as gospel, rockabilly, and honky-tonk. These styles she cut for Four Star Records have been considered below the quality of her later work for Decca Records. Steve Leggett of &quot;Allmusic&quot; commented, Her recordings prior to 1960, though, were something else again, and with the exception of 1956&#x27;s &quot;Walkin&#x27; After Midnight&quot; and perhaps one or two other songs, she seemed reined in and stifled as a singer, even though she was working with the same producer, Owen Bradley, who was to produce her 1960s successes. Oh the difference a song makes, because in the end the material she recorded between 1955 and 1960 – all of which is collected on these two discs – was simply too weak for Cline to turn into anything resembling gold, even with her obvious vocal skills.

Cline&#x27;s style has been largely associated with the Nashville Sound, a sub-genre of country music that linked traditional lyrics with orchestrated pop music styles. This new sound helped many of her singles to crossover onto the Billboard Hot 100 and gain a larger audience that did not always listen to country music. Her producer Owen Bradley built this sound onto her Decca recordings, sensing a potential in her voice that went beyond traditional country music. At first, she resisted the pop-sounding style, but was ultimately convinced to record in this new style. Stephen M. Desuner of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; explained that Cline has been an identifiable factor with the Nashville Sound: &quot;She essentially rewrote their songs simply by singing them, elevating their words and wringing every one of their rhymes for maximum dramatic potential.&quot; Mark Deming of &quot;Allmusic&quot; commented, &quot;Cline and Bradley didn&#x27;t invent &quot;countrypolitan,&quot; but precious few artists managed to meld the sophistication of pop and the emotional honesty of country as brilliantly as this music accomplishes with seemingly effortless grace, and these songs still sound fresh and brilliantly crafted decades after the fact.&quot;

===Image===
Cline&#x27;s public image changed during the course of her career. She began her career wearing cowgirl dresses and hats designed by her mother. However, as her music crossed over into pop, she began wearing sequined gowns and cocktail dresses. While she would often wear cowgirl costumes for live performances, she would also wear evening dresses for television and metropolitan performances. For her 1957 performance on &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot;, the show&#x27;s producer insisted that Cline wear an evening dress instead of the fringed cowgirl attire she had intended to wear. Her 1962 engagement at the Merri-Mint Theatre in Las Vegas represented this particular image shift. For one of her performances, Cline wore a sequined cocktail dress designed by her mother.

Cline has also been seen as a pioneer for women in country music. She has been cited as an inspiration by many performers in diverse styles of music. Kurt Wolff of &quot;Country Music: The Rough Guide&quot; said that Cline had an &quot;aggression&quot; and &quot;boisterous attitude&quot; that gained her the respect of her male counterparts. Wolff explained, &quot;She swaggered her way past stereotypes and other forces of resistance, showing the men in charge – and the public in general – that women were more than capable of singing about such hard subjects as divorce and drinking as well as love and understanding. Sean O&#x27;Hagan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that along with Minnie Pearl, Jean Shepard and Kitty Wells, Cline helped prove that country music was not &quot;macho&quot; and that &quot;strong women&quot; could have a &quot;strong voice&quot;. In 2013, Diane Reese wrote, &quot;she was what I call a pre-feminist woman. She didn&#x27;t open doors; she kicked them down.&quot; Mary Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann wrote in 2003 that Cline &quot;transformed what it meant to be a female country star&quot;.

==Legacy and recognition==

Cline has been cited in both country and pop music as of one of the greatest vocalists of all time. Her voice has also been called &quot;haunting&quot;, &quot;powerful&quot;, and &quot;emotional&quot;. Cline&#x27;s emotional expression and delivery of lyrics helped influence various musical genres and artists. With the support of producer Owen Bradley, Cline has been said to &quot;help define&quot; the Nashville Sound style of country music. While the subgenre has received mixed opinions, it has also been said to be a significant part of country music&#x27;s &quot;authenticity&quot;, with Cline being the center focal point of the subgenre. Other artists have noted her impact, including LeAnn Rimes who stated, &quot;I remember my dad telling me to listen to the way she told a story... I remember feeling more emotion when she sang than anyone else I had ever heard.&quot; Lucinda Williams commented on Cline&#x27;s vocal talent in helping define her legacy, stating, &quot;Even though her style is considered country, her delivery is more like a classic pop singer... That&#x27;s what set her apart from Loretta Lynn or Tammy Wynette. You&#x27;d almost think she was classically trained.&quot;

Cline has been a major influence on various music artists including Reba McEntire, Loretta Lynn, LeAnn Rimes, k.d. lang, Linda Ronstadt, Trisha Yearwood, Sara Evans, Dottie West, Kacey Musgraves, Margo Price, Cyndi Lauper, Trixie Mattel and Brandi Carlile. Dottie West (also a close friend of Cline&#x27;s) spoke about her influence on her own career, &quot;I think I was most influenced by Patsy Cline, she said things for people. There was so much feeling in there. In fact, she told me, &#x27;Hoss, if you can&#x27;t do it with feeling, don&#x27;t&#x27;&quot;. In 2019, Sara Evans discussed how Cline has been an influence since she was a young girl, &quot;I learned everything I could learn about her. I tried to mimic her singing to the &#x27;t&#x27;. We grew up singing in bars — my brothers, sisters and I — from the time I was really little. So I started covering every Patsy Cline song. Then when I first got my record deal I came to Winchester to visit a radio station to try to get them to play my song Three Chords and the Truth.&quot;

In 1973, Cline was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. With the induction, she became the first solo female artist to be included. In 1977, Cline&#x27;s friend and mentee Loretta Lynn released a tribute album entitled &quot;I Remember Patsy&quot;. The record contained covers of Cline&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Back in Baby&#x27;s Arms&quot; and &quot;Crazy&quot;. The album&#x27;s lead single was &quot;She&#x27;s Got You&quot;, which would reach the number 1 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart in 1977. In 1995, Cline received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award for her legacy and career. Additionally, her hits &quot;I Fall to Pieces&quot; and &quot;Crazy&quot; received inductions into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

In 1993, Cline was included on United States postal stamps as part of their &quot;Legends&quot; series. Other country artists that were included on stamp series were The Carter Family, Hank Williams, and Bob Wills. The stamps were dedicated in an official ceremony at the Grand Ole Opry by Postmaster General Marvin Runyon. In August 1999, Cline received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The ceremony was attended by her widower Charlie Dick and daughter Julie Fudge. During the 1990s, two of her songs were voted among the &quot;Greatest Juke Box Hits of All-Time&quot;. &quot;Crazy&quot; was voted as the number 1 greatest, along with &quot;I Fall to Pieces&quot; ranking at number 17.

Since the late 1990s, she received additional rankings and honors. In 1999, Cline was ranked at number 11 among VH1&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll&quot;. In 2003, she was included by Country Music Television on their list of the &quot;40 Greatest Women of Country Music&quot;. In 2010, Cline ranked at number 46 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All-Time&quot;. The magazine would rank her on their 2017 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Country Artists of All-Time&quot;, where she placed at number 12. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Cline at No. 13 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

Forty years after her death, MCA Nashville released a tribute album entitled &quot;Remembering Patsy Cline&quot; (2003). A television special also followed around the same time. The album consisted of cover versions of songs taken from Cline&#x27;s 1967 greatest hits album. It included songs covered by country artists such as Terri Clark and Martina McBride. It also featured artists from other genres such as Michelle Branch, Diana Krall and Patti Griffin.

Cline&#x27;s hometown of Winchester, Virginia has helped honor her legacy and career. In 1987, the local government approved the placing of markers within the town denoting it as the birthplace of Cline. The same year, a bell tower was erected in her burial location at Shenandoah Memorial Park. The bell tower cost thirty five thousand dollars and was partially funded by Cline&#x27;s friends Jan Howard and Loretta Lynn. In 2005, Cline&#x27;s childhood home was given an official on-site marker and included on the National Register of Historic Places. With the development of an organization entitled Celebrating Patsy Cline Inc., renovations began on Cline&#x27;s childhood home. In August 2011, the Patsy Cline House officially opened as a historic home for tours. In almost three months, about three thousand people visited the home. The home was restored to the era in which Cline lived in it during the 1950s with her mother and siblings. Replicas of furniture and stage clothes are also included. Daughter Julie Fudge spoke of the house in 2011, stating, &quot;I think when you go into the house, you will kind of feel like this is a snapshot of what it would have been like to visit when Mom lived there.&quot;

In 2017, the Patsy Cline Museum opened in Nashville, Tennessee, located at 119 3rd Ave. S., on the second floor in the same building as the Johnny Cash Museum. The museum includes Cline&#x27;s actual stage costumes, as well as her original scrapbook and record albums. It also features other artifacts such as the soda fountain machine from Gaunt&#x27;s Drug Store where Cline worked as a teenager. Original letters that Cline wrote to friends are also included in the museum&#x27;s collection.

Born as the eldest son of Chinese shipping magnate Tung Chao Yung, who founded Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL), Tung took over the family business after his father&#x27;s death in 1981. Four years later, OOCL teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, and the business was saved by the People&#x27;s Republic of China government through Henry Fok in 1986.

He was appointed an unofficial member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong by the last British Governor Chris Patten in 1992 and was tipped as Beijing&#x27;s favourite as the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR. In 1996, he was elected the Chief Executive by a 400-member Selection Committee. His government was embroiled with a series of crises, including the bird flu and the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. In 2002, he was re-elected without competition. In 2003, more than 500,000 protesters demanded Tung to step down in the light of the proposed legislation of the Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23 and the SARS outbreak. Tung resigned in the middle of his second term on 10 March 2005.

After his resignation, he was appointed vice chairman of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference by the Beijing government and formed the China-United States Exchange Foundation (CUSEF) in 2008 to influence public opinion towards China in the United States. In 2014, he founded a think tank Our Hong Kong Foundation consisting of the membership of numerous leading tycoons. He remains influential in Hong Kong politics and is dubbed as &quot;kingmaker&quot;.

==Family and early life==
Tung was born in Xuhui District, Shanghai on 7 July 1937, 29th day of the fifth lunar month in 1937 in the Chinese calendar into an influential shipping magnate family of Tung Chao Yung. Tung Chao Yung was the founder of the Orient Overseas Container Line, a shipping company which was closely associated with the government of the Republic of China. His younger brother, Tung Chee-chen, was ranked as the 23rd wealthiest man in Hong Kong in 2009, worth US$900 million. In January 2008, Tung and his family were ranked (also by Forbes) as the 16th wealthiest in Hong Kong, with a total value of US$3 billion.

In 1949 during the Chinese Communist Revolution, when Tung was 12 years old, Tung&#x27;s father moved the family to Hong Kong. His father remained close to Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Kuomintang government on Taiwan, in which the logo OCCL has been plum blossom, the national flower of the Republic of China. In the 1950s, Tung attended the Chung Wah Middle School, a leftist school later shut down by the Hong Kong colonial government in the light of the 1967 Hong Kong riots. He was sent abroad to study at Liverpool University, leaving him with a lifelong passion for the Liverpool Football Club. He graduated from the university with a Bachelor of Science degree in marine engineering in 1960. From Liverpool he was sent to the United States to work as an engineer at General Electric in Massachusetts, and then for the family business in New York. He also lived in San Francisco before he returned to Hong Kong in 1969.

All of Tung&#x27;s children hold American citizenship.

==Early business and political career==

He joined his father&#x27;s business upon his return to Hong Kong in 1969 and gradually took over the leadership of the family enterprise. He took over his family business in 1982 when his father died. However, in 1985, his company was heavily in debt and teetered on the edge of bankruptcy. Henry Fok, a pro-Beijing businessman took initiative and helped Tung&#x27;s family, with the support of the Beijing government.

Tung became close to the Communist authorities in Beijing afterward especially with Jiang Zemin, former General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, who had risen to power surrounded by his &quot;Shanghai clique&quot;; Tung could be associated with them because he was from the nearby city of Ningbo, Zhejiang and had lived and worked in Shanghai for a while.

Tung was a member of the Basic Law Consultative Committee from 1985 to 1990, responsible for the drafting of the Basic Law of Hong Kong. In 1993, he was appointed to the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference, the top advisory body of China. He also established close relationship with US President George H. W. Bush and US Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord.

Under the consensus between the British and Chinese government, Tung, until then remained a low profile in politics, was appointed to the Executive Council of Hong Kong by the last British Governor Chris Patten, the highest advisory body in the colonial government in 1992, before he left the office in 1996 and ran for the first Chief Executive election.

Before the election, he received a warm handshake from Jiang Zemin who crossed a crowded room to single out Tung, which was seen as a sign of him being regarded as Beijing&#x27;s choice for the Chief Executive. Tung employed three &quot;isms&quot; in his election campaign, namely Confucianism, elitism and nationalism. On 11 December 1996, he was elected by a 400-member Selection Committee, receiving 320 votes and beating former judge Yang Ti-liang and tycoon Peter Woo, all three candidates were of Shanghainese descent. He was sworn in as the first Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the day of transfer of sovereignty on 1 July 1997.

==Chief Executive==

===First term===

In early 1997, Tung saw his victory in the first Chief Executive election, in the voting conducted by 400 committees of electoral college whose members are appointed by the Chinese Government.

The government pledged to focus on three policy areas: housing, the elderly, and education. Measures on housing included a pledge to provide 85,000 housing flats each year so as to resolve the problems of soaring property prices. The Asian financial crisis that hit Hong Kong in months after Tung took office made this objective almost immediately redundant and, in fact, it was a collapse in property prices that became a far more pressing problem in the years between 1998 and 2002.

After being appointed by the State Council of China, Tung took office on 1 July 1997. His first term was significantly – and negatively – impacted by the Asian financial crisis and there was criticism by the general public of his style of governance. Job losses and plummeting values in the stock and property markets, combined with controversial economic policies (which were called crony capitalism at the time), the people of Hong Kong started to question Tung and the HKSAR government.

During Tung&#x27;s first term the government proposed a number of controversial infrastructure and reformation projects including technology park, a science park, a Chinese medicine centre and the Disney theme park. Tung&#x27;s decisions were somewhat questioned by the central government, including Jiang Zemin, former General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.

Questions arose over Tung&#x27;s decision to grant the Cyberport Project to Richard Li, son of tycoon Li Ka-shing, without the benefit of an open tender.

The way in which the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s land grant for its theme park on a 50-year lease apparently disrupted the market, and for studying the possibility of setting up a casino in Hong Kong. His administration was seen as troubled, particularly during the confusion of the first days of the new airport, the mis-handling of the avian influenza epidemic, declining standards due to education reforms (specifically teaching in the Cantonese &quot;mother tongue&quot; and mandatory English examination for teachers), the right of abode issue, and his disagreement of political views with the popular then Chief Secretary, Anson Chan. Tung&#x27;s popularity plummeted with the economy, to 47% satisfaction at the end of August 2002.

=== Second term ===

Tung Chee Hwa, with nominations from 714 members of the electoral college, was uncontested in the election for a second term, as according to the Chief Executive Election Ordinance, nominations from at least 100 members of the 800-strong electoral college are required for each candidate.

==== Accountability system ====

In an attempt to resolve the difficulties in governance, Tung reformed the structure of government substantially starting from his second term in 2002. In a system popularly called the Principal Officials Accountability system, all principal officials, including the Chief Secretary, Financial Secretary, Secretary for Justice and head of government bureaux would no longer be politically neutral career civil servants. Instead, they would all be political appointees chosen by the Chief Executive. The system was portrayed as the key to solve previous administrative problems, notably the cooperation of high-ranking civil servants with the Chief Executive. Under the new system, all heads of bureau became members of the Executive Council, and came directly under the Chief Executive instead of the Chief Secretary or the Financial Secretary. The heads of the Liberal Party and Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, two pro-government parties in the Legislative Council, were also appointed into the Executive Council to form a &quot;ruling alliance,&quot; a &quot;de facto&quot; coalition. This practically shut out the pro-democratic parties and individuals.

==== Crisis of governance in 2003 ====
The first major move of Tung in his second term was to push for the national security legislation to implement Article 23 of the Hong Kong Basic Law in September 2002. However, the initiative drew a hostile response from the pro-democratic camp, lawyers, journalists, religious leaders and human rights organisations. This stoked public concerns that the freedoms they enjoyed would deteriorate. The sentiment, together with other factors such as the SARS epidemic in early 2003, when the government was criticised for its slow response, strained hospital services and the unexpected death toll, resulted in the largest mass demonstration since the establishment of HKSAR, with an estimated 500,000 people (out of the population of 6,800,000) marching on 1 July 2003. Many demanded Tung to step down.

In response to the protests, the leader of the Liberal Party, James Tien, resigned from the Executive Council on evening 6 July, signifying the withdrawal of the party&#x27;s support for the bill implementing Article 23. As a result, the government had to postpone and later withdraw the bill from the legislative agenda. On 17 July 2003, Regina Ip, the then Secretary for Security who was responsible for implementing Article 23, resigned for personal reasons. Another Principal Official, Finance Secretary Antony Leung, who earlier suffered from a scandal over his purchase of a luxury vehicle weeks prior to his introduction of a car sales tax, which was dubbed as the &quot;Lexusgate&quot; scandal, resigned on the same day.

==== Subsequent developments ====

During the debate over Hong Kong&#x27;s constitutional development, Tung was criticised as not reflecting effectively the views of the general population to push for 2007/08 universal suffrage to the People&#x27;s Republic of China government. Although the primary target of popular opposition was the PRC government, Tung&#x27;s lack of support for the pro-democratic camp resulted in his low approval ratings.

In late 2003, in an attempt to bring back visitors to Hong Kong, Government agency InvestHK was mandated to sponsor the Harbour Fest music festival in October, organised by the American Chamber of Commerce. The result was a series of poorly attended concerts, HK$100m bill for the taxpayers, with the Government, InvestHK and the American Chamber of Commerce blaming each other for the flop, EOC chairman to be added.

Tung&#x27;s cabinet suffered another blow in July 2004 when another Principal Official, the Secretary for Health, Welfare &amp; Food, Dr. Yeoh Eng-kiong, resigned on 7 July to take political responsibility for the government&#x27;s handling of the SARS outbreak in 2003, after the release of the investigation report of LegCo over the issue.

In late 2004, the Tung administration experienced another embarrassment as the large planned sale of government-owned real estate, The Link REIT, was cancelled at the last moment by a lawsuit by a tenant from an affected estate.

With the subsequent improvement in the economy over 2004, unemployment fell and the long period of deflation ended. This resulted in a decrease in public discontent as the government&#x27;s popularity improved, and popular support for the democratic movement dwindled with a protest in January attracting a mere few thousand protesters compared to the 1 July protests of 2003 and 2004. However, the popularity of Tung himself remained low compared to his deputies including Donald Tsang and Henry Tang.

====Resignation====
Tung&#x27;s reputation suffered further damage when Hu Jintao gave him a humiliating public dressing-down for poor governance in December 2004. Official sources specifically cited the poor handling of the Link REIT listing, the West Kowloon cultural project, the Hung Hom flats episode. Tung himself denied it was a dressing-down, and insisted that he retained the central government&#x27;s support, although he and the rest of the government were asked to examine their past inadequacies. Hu&#x27;s words, however, were thinly veiled criticism. Nevertheless, in his January 2005 Policy Address, Tung gave a rather critical verdict on his own performance.

The speculation which was running rife in the weeks in the run-up to his actual resignation, and its intensity, continued to perpetuate the impression of Tung&#x27;s &quot;weakness&quot; and &quot;confusion&quot;. Prior to Tung&#x27;s resignation, in mid-February Stanley Ho, a tycoon with close ties with Beijing, had already commented on the possible candidates for the next Chief Executive and personally endorsed Donald Tsang. This started rumours that Tung would be nominated to the election of vice chairman of Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) of the PRC. On the night of 27 February 2005, it was revealed that he and nine other persons would be appointed as new members to the CPPCC. All the local newspapers, except for the three controlled by the PRC government, namely &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot;, &quot;Wen Wei Po&quot; and &quot;Hong Kong Commercial Daily&quot;, went to the presses preemptively on the morning of 2 March with the headline &quot;Tung Resigns&quot;. Tung declined to comment when questioned by journalists waiting at the government headquarters.

On 10 March 2005, Tung assembled a press conference at the Central Government Offices and announced that he had tendered his resignation due to &quot;health problems&quot;. After flying to Beijing on 11 March, Tung was elected Vice Chairman of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on 12 March 2005, the last day of CPPCC annual meeting.

His resignation sparked a constitutional debate of whether his successor should fill his remaining term of two years, or start a new term of five years. Tung was mostly chosen by the PRC due to his business background as well as owing Beijing for saving him from bankruptcy with a US$100 million loan.

==Post-Chief Executive==
===U.S.−China politics===
Soon after he resigned as Chief Executive, he was appointed vice-chairman of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in March 2005. In 2008, Tung formed the China-United States Exchange Foundation (CUSEF), a group whose stated aim is to promote better understanding between the two countries. In 2009, he was named a Global Fellow at Columbia University. In 2017, it was reported that the CUSEF has been a tool for the Chinese Communist Party to push to strengthen its influence over policy debate around the globe by massive funding into organisations abroad, for instance the China Studies department of the Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS).

In 2018, the University of Texas at Austin rejected funding from the CUSEF for its recently established China Public Policy Center, after U.S. Senator Ted Cruz wrote a letter to UT Austin president Greg Fenves in which Cruz expressed his concerns that the university&#x27;s China Public Policy Center was considering a partnership with the foundation &quot;given its affiliation with the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s United Front system and its registration as an agent of a foreign principal.&quot; Cruz also noted Tung&#x27;s CPPCC vice chairmanship is &quot;an organization which works closely with the United Front, the structure the CCP utilizes to manage foreign influence operations.&quot;

===Influence in Hong Kong===
During the 2012 Chief Executive election, it was reported that one of the two candidates, Leung Chun-ying was Tung&#x27;s protege and therefore Leung acquired the goodwill of Xi Jinping, then the head of managing the Hong Kong and Macau affairs. Leung, who was seen as the underdog, eventually won in the election over the other pro-Beijing candidate Henry Tang.

In 2014, Tung founded a thinktank Our Hong Kong Foundation. The foundation has about 80 advisors which consists some of the most well known tycoons and public figures, drawn from the business, education, social welfare, legal and religious sectors, including former Financial Secretary Antony Leung, former Monetary Authority Chief Executive Joseph Yam, and Jack Ma, the chairman of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The foundation has been vocal in advocating public policies, including the housing and land supply. In 2018, its proposal of massive reclamation by constructing artificial islands were partly adopted in Chief Executive Carrie Lam&#x27;s policy address.

In the 2017 Chief Executive election, he was seen hugging Carrie Lam, then Chief Secretary for Administration who was seen as potential candidate for the Chief Executive after incumbent Leung Chun-ying announced he would not seek for re-election. It was seen as his blessing for Lam to be the next Chief Executive. In February, &quot;Hong Kong Economic Journal&quot; cited unnamed sources that Tung Chee-hwa said in a closed-door meeting that Beijing may not appoint former Financial Secretary of Hong Kong John Tsang as Chief Executive even if he wins the election. He said this was the reason he asked Carrie Lam to run in the election in order to prevent an &quot;embarrassing situation&quot;. 30 electors of the Legal subsector in the Election Committee expressed &quot;deep concerns&quot; about Tung&#x27;s comments in a joint statement, stating that &quot;such action undermines the fairness of our Chief Executive election and shows a callous disregard for the aspirations of most Hong Kong people to have free and fair elections without ignorant and insensitive interference.&quot; He was dubbed as &quot;kingmaker&quot; in the Hong Kong political community.

In July 2017, Tung sold his family business Orient Overseas (International) Limited (OOIL) to Chinese state-owned Cosco Shipping in a HK$49.2 billion (US$6.3 billion) deal.

==Awards==
Tung was awarded a Grand Bauhinia Medal in 2006. He was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate degree in Social Sciences (D.S.Sc) by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology on 10 November 2006.

<text>Anne Ramsey-Mobley (March 27, 1929 – August 11, 1988) was an American actress. She was best known for her film roles as Mama Fratelli in &quot;The Goonies&quot; (1985) and as Mrs. Lift in &quot;Throw Momma from the Train&quot; (1987), the latter of which earned her nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. Additionally, Ramsey&#x27;s respective turns in both aforementioned films earned her two Saturn Awards.

==Early life==
Ramsey was born in Omaha, Nebraska, the daughter of Eleanor (née Smith), the former national treasurer of the Girl Scouts of the USA, and Nathan Mobley, an insurance executive. Her mother was a descendant of the Pilgrims (William Brewster), and her uncle was U.S. Ambassador David S. Smith. Ramsey was raised in Great Neck, New York and Greenwich, Connecticut. She attended prestigious Rosemary Hall in Greenwich, CT and matriculated to Bennington College where she became interested in theatre. She performed in several Broadway productions in the 1950s and married actor Logan Ramsey in 1954. They moved to Philadelphia where they formed the Theatre of the Living Arts in 1959.

==Career==
In the 1970s, Ramsey began a successful Hollywood career in character roles and appeared in such television programs as &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; and &quot;Ironside&quot;. She appeared with her husband in seven films, including her first, &quot;The Sporting Club&quot; (1971), and her last, &quot;Meet the Hollowheads&quot; (1989). In 1988, Ramsey was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture for her performance in &quot;Throw Momma from the Train&quot; (1987), with Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito. The film also earned her a second Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress; she had received her first for &quot;The Goonies&quot; (1985). In February 1988, she guest-starred on an episode of &quot;ALF&quot; broadcast six months before her death. She had a cameo part in &quot;Scrooged&quot; shortly before her death. Six further films in which she appeared were released in the two years following her death.

==Death==
Ramsey&#x27;s somewhat slurred speech, a trademark of her later performances, was caused in part from having had some of her tongue and her jaw removed during surgery for esophageal cancer in 1984. 

In 1988, Ramsey&#x27;s cancer returned. She died on August 11 at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California. Ramsey is buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery in North Omaha, Nebraska.

<text>Steven Antin (born April 19, 1958) is an American actor, stunt performer, screenwriter, producer, and director.

== Early life ==
Antin was born in Queens, New York City, the son of British Jewish immigrants. He is the brother of fellow actor Neil Antin, Pussycat Dolls founder Robin Antin, and celebrity hairstylist Jonathan Antin.

== Career ==
Antin was a co-lead in the 1982 film &quot;The Last American Virgin&quot;, and played Troy Perkins, the bad-guy preppie jock in Richard Donner&#x27;s &quot;The Goonies&quot;. He also played one of the rapists in the Academy Award-winning film &quot;The Accused&quot;. Antin starred alongside David Warner in the independent film &quot;Drive&quot;.

Antin played the titular &quot;Jessie&quot; in Rick Springfield&#x27;s &quot;Jessie&#x27;s Girl&quot; video. His screenplay &quot;Inside Monkey Zetterland&quot; was turned into a film featuring many respected independent performers. In the late 1990s he made several appearances in gay-oriented films including &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot;, co-starring Eric Roberts and comedian Margaret Cho. Antin himself later came out publicly. Antin also enjoyed a successful career as a stunt performer in dozens of films.

Antin has turned to working as a successful screenwriter, writing such films as &quot;Gloria&quot; (1999) and &quot;Chasing Papi&quot;. He also created, wrote and produced the television series &quot;Young Americans&quot; for The WB.

In the late 2000s, Antin turned to directing. He has directed several music videos, such as Girlicious&#x27; &quot;Like Me&quot; and Destinee &amp; Paris&#x27; &quot;FairyTale&quot;, and in 2006, the feature film &quot;Glass House: The Good Mother&quot; starring Angie Harmon, produced by Billy Pollina. He is one of the executive producers and creators of The CW&#x27;s 2007 reality series which seeks to find the next member of the hit pop group, the Pussycat Dolls.

Antin is openly gay, and was once the boyfriend of David Geffen. They were together for a little more than one year.

Antin wrote and directed the 2010 film &quot;Burlesque&quot;, which stars an ensemble cast.

<text>PJSC AeroflotRussian Airlines (, ), commonly known as Aeroflot ( or ; , , ), is the flag carrier and the largest airline of Russia. Aeroflot is headquartered in the Central Administrative Okrug, Moscow, with its hub being Sheremetyevo International Airport. The Federal Agency for State Property Management, an agency of the Government of Russia, owns 73.77% of the company, with the rest of the shares being public float.

During the time of the Soviet Union, Aeroflot was one of the largest airlines in the world. In 1992, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Aeroflot was divided into approximately 400 regional airlines informally known as Babyflots and was restructured into an open joint-stock company.

It has a market share in Russia of approximately 39%. Including subsidiaries, the company carried 47.3 million passengers in 2023. Aeroflot also owns Rossiya Airlines and Pobeda, a low-cost carrier.

The Aeroflot fleet, excluding subsidiaries, includes 171 airplanes: 112 Airbus planes and 59 Boeing planes. The company plans on making the Yakovlev MC-21 its flagship plane, with deliveries expected to start in 2025 or 2026.

==History==

===Aeroflot - early history (1932-1945)===

Responsibility for all civil aviation activities in the Soviet Union came under the control of the Chief Directorate of the Civil Air Fleet on 25 February 1932, and on 25 March 1932 the name &quot;Aeroflot&quot; was officially adopted for the entire Soviet Civil Air Fleet. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union Congress in 1933 set out development plans for the civil aviation industry for the following five years, with air transportation becoming one of the primary means of transportation in the Soviet Union, linking all major cities. The government also implemented plans to expand the Soviet aircraft industry to make it less dependent on foreign built aircraft; in 1930, 50% of aircraft flying services in the Soviet Union were of foreign manufacture. Expansion of air routes which had taken shape in the late 1920s, continued into the 1930s. Local (MVL) services were greatly expanded in Soviet Central Asia and the Soviet Far East, which by the end of the second five-year plan in 1937 was in length out of a total network of . The agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany relating to Deruluft expired on 1 January 1937 and wasn&#x27;t renewed, which saw the joint venture carrier ceasing operations on 1 April 1937. On that date Aeroflot began operations on the Moscow to Stockholm route, and began operating the ex-Deruluft route from Leningrad to Riga utilising Douglas DC-3s and Tupolev ANT-35s (PS-35s). Flights from Moscow to Berlin, via Königsberg, were suspended until 1940, when they were restarted by Aeroflot and Deutsche Luft Hansa as a result of the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, and they continued until the opening of the Eastern Front in World War II in 1941.

Under the third five-year plan, which began in 1938, civil aviation development continued, with improvements to airport installations being made and construction of airports being commenced. In addition to the expansion of services between the Soviet Union&#x27;s main cities, local routes (MVL) were also expanded, and by 1940, 337 MVL routes had operations on a scheduled basis. Serial production of the Lisunov Li-2 (license-built Douglas DC-3) commenced in 1939, and the aircraft became the backbone of the Aeroflot fleet on mainline trunk routes. The day after Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany, on 22 June 1941, the Sovnarkom placed the Civil Air Fleet under the control of Narkomat, leading to the full-scale mobilisation of Aeroflot crews and technicians for the Soviet war effort. Prior to the invasion, the Aeroflot network extended over , and amongst the longest routes being operated from Moscow were those to Tbilisi (via Baku), Tashkent and Vladivostok. Aeroflot aircraft, including PS-35s and PS-43s, were based at Khodynka Aerodrome in Moscow; and important missions undertaken by Aeroflot aircraft and crews included flying supplies to the besieged cities of Leningrad, Kyiv, Odessa and Sevastopol. During the Battle of Stalingrad, between August 1942 and February 1943, Aeroflot operated 46,000 missions to Stalingrad, ferrying in of supplies and 30,000 troops. Following the defeat of the Wehrmacht, 80 Junkers Ju 52/3ms were captured from the Germans, and were placed into the service of the Civil Air Fleet, and after the war were placed into regular service across the Soviet Union. Whilst civil operations in European Russia west of the front line, which ran from Leningrad to Moscow to Rostov-on-Don, were prevented from operating because of the war, services from Moscow to the Urals, Siberia, Central Asia, and other regions which were not affected by the war, continued. By the end of the war, Aeroflot had flown 1,595,943 special missions, including 83,782 at night, and carried 1,538,982 men and of cargo.

===Aeroflot during the Cold War (1946–91)===

At the end of World War II, the Soviet government repaired and rebuilt essential airport infrastructure, and it strengthened the Aeroflot units in the European part of the Soviet Union. In 1945, Aeroflot carried 537,000 passengers, compared with 359,000 in 1940. The government made it a priority in the immediate postwar years to expand services from Moscow to the capital of each of the Republics of the Soviet Union, in addition to important industrial centres on the country and transferred to Aeroflot many Lisunov Li-2s, which became the backbone of the Aeroflot fleet. The Ilyushin Il-12 entered service on Aeroflot&#x27;s all-Union scheduled routes on 22 August 1947, and supplemented already existing Li-2 services. The original Ilyushin Il-18 entered service around the same time as the Il-12, and was operated on routes from Moscow to Yakutsk, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, Alma Ata, Tashkent, Sochi, Mineralnye Vody and Tbilisi. By 1950, the Il-18 was withdrawn from service, replaced by Il-12s. MVL and general aviation services received a boost in March 1948, when the first Antonov An-2s were delivered and entered service in Central Russia. Development of MVL services over latter years was attributed to the An-2, which was operated by Aeroflot in all areas of the Soviet Union.

Aeroflot&#x27;s route network had extended to by 1950, and it carried 1,603,700 passengers, of freight and of mail that year. Night flights began in the same year, and the fifth five-year plan, covering the period 1951–1955, emphasised Aeroflot expanding night-time operations, which vastly improved aircraft utilisation. By 1952, 700 destinations in the Soviet Union received regular flights from Aeroflot. On 30 November 1954, the Ilyushin Il-14 entered service, and the aircraft took a leading role in the operation of Aeroflot&#x27;s all-Union services. The number of passengers carried in 1955 increased to 2,500,000, whilst freight and mail carriage also increased, to 194,960 and 63,760 tons, respectively. By this time, Aeroflot&#x27;s route network covered a distance of . The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, held in 1956, included plans for Aeroflot services to be dramatically increased 3.8 times, with a target of 16,000,000 annual passengers by 1960. To meet these goals, Aeroflot introduced higher capacity turbojet and turbine-prop aircraft on key domestic routes, and on services to Aeroflot destinations abroad. A major step for Aeroflot occurred on 15 September 1956 when the Tupolev Tu-104 jet aircraft entered service on the Moscow-Omsk-Irkutsk route, marking the world&#x27;s first sustained jet airline service. The airline began international flights with the type on 12 October 1956 under the command of Boris Bugayev with flights from Moscow to Prague. The aircraft placed Aeroflot in an enviable position, as airlines in the West had operated throughout the 1950s with large piston-engined aircraft. By 1958, the route network covered , and the airline carried 8,231,500 passengers, and 445,600 tons of mail and freight, with fifteen percent of all-Union services being operated by jet aircraft.
Aeroflot introduced the Antonov An-10 and Ilyushin Il-18 in 1959, and together with its existing jet aircraft, the airline was able to extend services on modern aircraft to twenty one cities by 1960. The Tupolev Tu-114, then the world&#x27;s largest airliner, entered service with the Soviet carrier on 24 April 1961 on the Moscow-Khabarovsk route; covering a distance of in 8 hours 20 minutes. The expansion of the Aeroflot fleet saw services with modern aircraft being extended to forty one cities in 1961, with fifty percent of all-Union services being operated by these aircraft. This fleet expansion also saw the number of passengers carried in 1961 skyrocketing to 21,800,000. Further expansion came in 1962 when both the Tupolev Tu-124 and Antonov An-24 entered regular service with Aeroflot on various medium and short-haul routes. By 1964, Aeroflot operated direct flights from Moscow to 100 cities, from Leningrad to 44 cities, and from Kyiv to 38 cities. The airline also operated direct flights from Mineralnye Vody to 48 cities across the Soviet Union, denoting the importance of the operation of holiday aircraft services to Aeroflot. Statistics for the same year showed Aeroflot operating an all-Union route network extending over , and carrying 36,800,000 passengers.

By 1966, Aeroflot carried 47,200,000 passengers over a domestic route network of . For the period of the eighth five-year plan, which ran from 1966 to 1970, Aeroflot carried a total of 302,200,000 passengers, 6.47 billion tons of freight and 1.63 billion tons of mail. During the five-year plan period, all-Union services were extended over an additional 350 routes; an additional 1,000 MVL routes were begun, and 40 new routes were opened up with all-cargo flights. In 1967, the Ilyushin Il-62 and Tupolev Tu-134 were introduced, and in September 1968 the Yakovlev Yak-40 regional jet began operations on short-haul services. That same year, the Il-62 inaugurated the long-delayed service between Moscow and New York, which finally began in July and was operated by Aeroflot and Pan Am jointly. According to the book &quot;The Aeroflot Story: From Russia With Luck&quot;: &quot;This business relationship became an acrimonious affair in which both parties complained it had been wronged by the other. Pan Am accused the Soviets of illegally siphoning away Moscow-to-New York passengers, whilst in turn; Aeroflot accused US consular officials in Russia of having steered passengers to Pan Am flights.&quot; In 1968, the company opened its first office in the United States.
By 1970, the last year of the five-year plan period, Aeroflot was operating flights to over 3,500 destinations in the Soviet Union, and at the height of the 1970 summer holidays season, the airline was carrying approximately 400,000 passengers per day, and 90% of passengers were being carried on propeller-turbine and jet aircraft. In March 1970, Aeroflot had amassed a route network that was long, a quarter of which covered international destinations. At this time, the carrier had agreements with countries but it only served of them, including destinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;FI1970-463/4&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1971, the Central Administration of International Air Traffic () (TsUMVS) was established within the framework of IATA, and became the sole enterprise authorised to operate international flights. Abroad, the airline was known as Aeroflot Soviet Airlines. In 1976, Aeroflot carried its 100 millionth passenger. Its flights were mainly concentrated around the Soviet Union, but the airline also had an international network covering five continents: North and South America, Europe, Africa and Asia. The network included countries such as the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Spain, Cuba, Mexico and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Aeroflot service between the Soviet Union and the United States was interrupted from 15 September 1983 until 2 August 1990, following an executive order by U.S. President Ronald Reagan revoking Aeroflot&#x27;s license to operate flights into and out of the United States following the downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 by the Soviet Air Force. Flights resumed in April 1986. At the start of the 1990s, Aeroflot reorganised again giving more autonomy to territorial divisions. R. E. G. Davies, former curator of the Smithsonian Institution, claims that by 1992 Aeroflot had over 600,000 people operating over 10,000 aircraft.

====Other functions====

Once the world&#x27;s largest carrier, Aeroflot did not restrict its operations to the transportation of passengers, but monopolised all civil aviation activities within the Soviet Union. Apart from passenger transportation that covered a domestic network of over 3,600 villages, towns and cities, activities undertaken by the airline that were labelled as &quot;non-transport tasks&quot; included air ambulance; aerial application; heavy lifting for the Soviet Space Agency; offshore oil platform support; exploration and aeromagnetic survey for natural resources; support for construction projects; transport of military troops and supplies (as an adjunct to the Soviet Air Force); atmospheric research; and remote area patrol. It operated hundreds of helicopters and cargo aircraft in addition to civil airliners. It also operated the Soviet equivalent of a presidential aircraft and other VIP transports of government and Communist party officials. Aeroflot was also responsible for such services as ice patrol in the Arctic Ocean and escorting of ships through frozen seas; oil exploration; power line surveillance; and transportation and heavy lifting support on construction projects. For the latter tasks, Aeroflot used, in addition to smaller helicopters, the Mil Mi-10 flying crane capable of lifting . Hauling of heavy cargo, including vehicles, was performed by the world&#x27;s largest operational helicopter, the Mil Mi-26. Its unusual eight-blade rotor enabled it to lift a maximum payload of 20 tons. The medium- and long-range passenger- and cargo aircraft of Aeroflot were also part of the strategic air transport reserve, ready to provide immediate airlift support to the armed forces. Short-range aircraft and helicopters were available for appropriate military support missions.

===Post-Soviet Aeroflot (1992–)===

After the Dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, service expanded significantly. Up until that time, Aeroflot had been the only establishment providing air services throughout the Soviet Union, but with its breakup Aeroflot branches of these countries began their own services, and the airline itself came under control of Russia, the largest of the CIS republics, and was renamed &quot;AeroflotRussian International Airlines (ARIA)&quot;. In 1992, Aeroflot was divided into approximately 400 regional airlines informally known as Babyflots, which included BAL Bashkirian Airlines, KrasAir, Moscow Airways and Tatarstan Airlines, with Aeroflot keeping the international routes.

In 1994, Aeroflot was registered as a joint-stock company and the government sold off 49% of its stake to Aeroflot employees. In the 1990s, Aeroflot was primarily focused on international flights from Moscow. However, by the end of the decade Aeroflot started an expansion in the domestic market. In 2000, the company name was changed to &quot;AeroflotRussian Airlines&quot; to reflect the change in the company strategy. The Aeroflot fleet shrank dramatically in the post-Soviet era, dropping from 5,400 planes in 1991 to 115 in 1996.

In 1995, Boris Berezovsky played a key role in a management reshuffle that led to Nikolai Glushkov becoming CFO of the company. The two were later accused of embezzling $700 million from the airline, laundering the money through two Swiss companies, Forus and Andava. In 2010, CHF51 million in frozen assets in Swiss bank accounts were returned to Aeroflot.

In the early 2000s, the airline hired British consultants for rebranding. From the start, plans were afoot to replace the hammer and sickle logo, a symbol of Soviet communism; despite this the logo was not scrapped, as it was the most recognisable symbol of the company for over 70 years. A new Aircraft livery and uniforms for flight attendants were designed and a promotional campaign launched in 2003. Its fleet has undergone a major reorganisation during which most of the Soviet aircraft were replaced by Western-built jets; concerns over fuel consumption rather than safety concerns were cited for such a move. Airbus A319s and A320s for short-haul flights in Europe; and Boeing 767s and Airbus A330s for long-haul routes; were gradually incorporated into the Aeroflot fleet. Aeroflot began working with the US travel technology firm Sabre Corporation in 1997, and in 2004 signed an agreement to use Sabre&#x27;s software as its new computer reservation system, further extending the relationship with Sabre in 2010. On 29 July 2004, a new corporate slogan was adopted: &quot;Sincerely Yours. Aeroflot&quot;.

In April 2006, Aeroflot became the tenth airline to join SkyTeam, and the first air carrier in the former Soviet Union to do so. The company announced plans to increase cargo operations. It registered the &quot;Aeroflot-Cargo&quot; trademark in 2006.

Aeroflot became the sole shareholder of Donavia—a domestic airline then-named Aeroflot-Don—in December 2006, when it boosted its stake in the company from 51% to 100%; soon afterwards, Aeroflot-Nord was created following the buyout of Arkhangelsk Airlines.

====Expansion and re-organization====

In December 2009, after it filed for bankruptcy, Aeroflot-Cargo merged into Aeroflot.

In November 2011, Rostec, a state agency, merged five airlines it owned - Vladivostok Avia, Saravia, Rossiya Airlines, SAT Airlines and Orenair - into Aeroflot, acquiring an additional 3.5% of the company in a ₽2.5 billion deal. Saravia was then sold to private investors. In September 2013, Aurora (originally called Taiga) was created, combining Vladivostok Air and SAT Airlines.

In June 2013, at the World Airline Awards which took place at the Le Bourget air show, Aeroflot was awarded the international prize as the best air carrier in Eastern Europe.

In October 2013, the company introduced an affiliated low-cost carrier (LCC), Dobrolet. It started operations in June 2014; however, it ceased on due to EU sanctions over the airline launching flights to Crimea. In late August 2014, Aeroflot announced the launch of Pobeda, a new LCC to replace Dobrolet using aircraft transferred from Orenair. It started operations from Vnukovo Airport in December 2014.

In March 2014, as a response to the Revolution of Dignity, the company announced rerouting of flights to avoid flying over Ukraine. Also, in March 2014, Aeroflot IATA airline designator ″SU″ was adopted by its subsidiary Rossiya. In September 2015, Aeroflot agreed to acquire 75% of Transaero Airlines for the symbolic price of ₽1, but abandoned the plan after failing to come to terms on a takeover. Aeroflot instead took over several of Transaero&#x27;s aircraft by assuming its leases after Transaero ceased operations in December 2015, introducing the Boeing 747 and Boeing 777 to the Aeroflot fleet and allowing the company to cancel some of its jet orders.

Subsidiaries Rossiya Airlines, Donavia and Orenair combined operations in late March 2016. Orenair AOC was cancelled by Russian authorities in late . Donavia and Orenair were declared bankrupt in 2017.

In June 2018, the company signed a codeshare agreement with Aerolineas Argentinas.

In December 2020, the company sold its 51% stake in Aurora to Sakhalin Region Development Corporation for ₽1.
====2022 airspace bans and sanctions====
In February and March 2022, as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Aeroflot and other Russian airlines were banned from the airspace of many countries and several routes were cancelled as a result. Russian airlines were added to the list of air carriers banned in the European Union for safety reasons because planes were re-registered in Russia and no longer had foreign airworthiness certificates. The U.S. Department of Commerce banned companies from servicing Boeing planes operated by Aeroflot, Aviastar, Azur Air, Belavia, Rossiya and Utair. Manchester United F.C. cancelled its sponsorship agreement that made Aeroflot its official carrier since July 2013. Sabre Corporation and others removed access by Aeroflot to their computer reservation systems and global distribution systems.

In response to the international sanctions during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Aeroflot migrated to a Russian-based passenger service system, began sourcing aircraft parts via obscure trading companies, free-trade zones and middlemen in countries that have not imposed sanctions on Russia such as United Arab Emirates and China, and placed orders for Russian-made jets such as the Yakovlev MC-21 to reduce its dependence on foreign-made jets.

In September 2023, Aeroflot paid $645 million to acquire 17 aircraft and five spare jet engines that were leased to Aeroflot and owned by AerCap and were stranded in Russia upon the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

On 23 December 2024, Aeroflot resumed flights between the Russian capital and Hong Kong after a 4-year hiatus following the COVID-19 pandemic. Flights are available three times weekly for this route where the airline will deploy its Airbus A330-300 aircraft.

The company plans on making the Yakovlev MC-21 its flagship plane, with deliveries expected to start in 2025 or 2026.

==Accidents and incidents==

Aeroflot has had a total of 8,231 passengers dying in Aeroflot crashes according to the Aircraft Crashes Record Office, mostly during the Soviet era, about five times more than any other airline. From 1946 to 1989, the carrier was involved in 721 incidents. In 2013, AirlineRatings.com reported that five of the ten aircraft models involved in the highest numbers of fatal accidents were old Soviet models. From 1992 to 2020, the carrier was involved in 14 incidents; since 1996, only two incidents have resulted in fatalities.

==Criticism==
===Allegations of discrimination against overweight flight attendants===
In 2016, the company linked the pay of its flight attendants to their dress sizes. All the flight attendants were photographed and measured, and some were weighed. Women above a Russian size 48 were barred from international flights. According to the flight attendants&#x27; trade union, the policy affected about 600 Aeroflot attendants. The company successfully defended itself in court in April 2017 by saying that a survey of Aeroflot passengers showed that &quot;92% want to see stewardesses who fit into the clothes sizes we are talking about here&quot; and that every extra kilogram meant spending an extra ₽800 per year on fuel. The company denied all the accusations of discrimination. In September 2017, the appeal court decided that requirements banning employment by women who wore large sizes was unenforceable and ordered ₽5,000 in compensation plus back pay for Yevgenia Magurina, a flight attendant who filed a discrimination suit; however, the court did not rule explicitly that the policy was discriminatory.

===Working conditions===
Both pilots and crews at Aeroflot allegedly have one of the lowest salaries in the industry. This has led to defection of staff to other carriers.

===Ban on employee smartphone use===
In November 2018, the company&#x27;s executive director Vitaly Savelyev signed new rules, according to which employees of the Moscow office of the airline were forbidden to bring and use smartphones at work, allegedly to prevent them from taking videos.

===Incidents with flight attendants===

In May 2012, Aeroflot fired 19-year-old flight attendant Yekaterina Solovyova for mocking the crash of a Sukhoi Superjet at Mount Salak in a Twitter post where she wrote: &quot;&quot;What, a Superjet crashed? Hahaha! Piece of crap! It&#x27;s a pity it&#x27;s not Aeroflot&#x27;s, there would be one less and maybe they would even sell the rest back to someone&quot;. Solovyova later said she had misworded her thoughts about the aircraft&#x27;s design flaws: &quot;I flew on the Superjet several times. And there the doors did not close several times, there were also problems with the water supply... Flights were delayed because of this... I just wanted to say that these planes should be taken out of service of our airline. I didn&#x27;t want to offend the relatives of the victims. I regret my words&quot;.

In January 2013, Aeroflot fired another flight attendant, Tatyana Kozlenko, for posting an image with a middle finger gesture directed to passengers in a cabin on her VKontakte account.

In April 2018, Aeroflot reported it would fire one more flight attendant after a passenger complained that on a flight from Moscow to Kaliningrad the flight attendant had announced Kaliningrad in English as Königsberg, its former German name.

<doc id="89661" wikidata="Q1969858" url="?curid=89661" title="Storyville, New Orleans">
<text>Storyville was the red-light district of New Orleans, Louisiana, from 1897 to 1917. It was established by municipal ordinance under the New Orleans City Council, to regulate prostitution. Sidney Story, a city alderman, wrote guidelines and legislation to control prostitution within the city. The ordinance designated an area of the city in which prostitution, although still nominally illegal, was tolerated or regulated. The area was originally referred to as &quot;The District&quot;, but its nickname, &quot;Storyville&quot;, soon caught on, much to the chagrin of Alderman Story. It was bound by the streets of North Robertson, Iberville, Basin, and St. Louis Streets. It was located by a train station, making it a popular destination for travelers throughout the city, and became a centralized attraction in the heart of New Orleans. Only a few of its remnants are now visible. The neighborhood lies in Faubourg Tremé and the majority of the land was repurposed for public housing. It is well known for being the home of jazz musicians, most notably Louis Armstrong as a minor.

==History==
Though developed under the proposed title The District, the eventual nickname &quot;Storyville&quot; originated from City Councilman Sidney Story, who wrote the legislation and guidelines to be followed within the proposed neighborhood limits. The thirty-eight block area was bounded by Iberville, Basin Street, St. Louis, and N. Robertson streets. His vision came from port cities that legalized prostitution and was officially established on July 6, 1897. For decades most of this former district was occupied by the Iberville Housing Projects (mostly demolished), two blocks inland from the French Quarter.

The District was established to restrict prostitution to one area of the city where authorities could monitor and regulate such activity. In the late 1890s, the New Orleans city government studied the legalized red light districts of northern German and Dutch ports and set up Storyville based on such models. Between 1895 and 1915, &quot;blue books&quot; were published in Storyville. These books were guides to prostitution for visitors to the district wishing to use these services; they included house descriptions, prices, particular services, and the &quot;stock&quot; each house offered. The Storyville blue-books were inscribed with the motto: &quot;Order of the Garter: &quot;Honi Soit Qui Mal Y Pense&quot; (Shame on Him Who Thinks Evil of It)&quot;. It took some time for Storyville to gain recognition, but by 1900, it was on its way to becoming New Orleans&#x27;s largest revenue center.

Establishments in Storyville ranged from cheap &quot;cribs&quot; to more expensive houses, up to a row of elegant mansions along Basin Street for well-heeled customers. New Orleans&#x27; cribs were 50-cent joints, whereas the more expensive establishments could cost up to $10. Black and white brothels coexisted in Storyville; but black men were barred from legally purchasing services in either black or white brothels. Following the establishment of these brothels, restaurants and saloons began to open in Storyville, bringing in additional tourists. The District was adjacent to one of the main railway stations, where travelers arrived in the city.

At the beginning of the United States&#x27; involvement in World War I, Secretary of War Newton Baker did not want troops to have distractions while being deployed. The Navy had troops located in New Orleans and the city was pressed to close Storyville. Prostitution was made illegal in 1917 and Storyville was used for the purpose of entertainment. Most of its buildings were later destroyed, and in 1940 its location was used to create the Iberville housing projects.

===The Blue Book===
In the early 1900s, a Blue Book could be purchased for 25 cents. Blue Books were created for advertising the services of the sex workers of Storyville and included the names of working prostitutes in New Orleans. Arranged by name or address, the prostitutes were also distinguished by race and religion, with special markings for each category. Sex workers could be identified by such categories as black, white, octaroon, Jewish or French.

Landladies would be identified in bold font and information about popular houses, including interior and exterior pictures, was included. They also included advertisements for national and local cigar makers, distillers, lawyers, restaurants, drugstores, and taxi companies. The fees for general or specific services at the listed brothels were not included.

Blue Books could be purchased throughout the district in various barbershops, saloons, and railroad stations. Primarily they were sold on the corner of Basin Street and Canal Street.

The first Blue Book of Storyville was made between 1895 and 1896, but it was not until 1909 that the first popular edition was published. Billy Struve was its main producer in New Orleans. Struve, a manager of the saloon of Thomas Charles Anderson, the &quot;Mayor of Storyville&quot;, published the books on the second floor of Lulu White&#x27;s saloon on the corner of Basin Street and Bienville. Approximately sixteen editions were published until 1915.

==Notable places in Storyville==
=== Mahogany Hall ===
Storyville contained a large variety of brothels and parlors to satisfy the diverse tastes of visitors to New Orleans. Mahogany Hall was the most lavish of them, operated by Lulu White, an important businesswoman in the district. Mahogany Hall was an octoroon hall, employing prostitutes of mixed races. It was located at 235 Basin Street.

Mahogany Hall employed roughly 40 prostitutes. Popular women of Mahogany Hall included Victoria Hall, Emma Sears, Clara Miller, Estelle Russell, Sadie Reed and Sadie Levy. Lulu White advertised these women as having beautiful figures and a gift from nature, and gained a reputation for having the best women around.

Mahogany Hall was originally called the Hall of Mirrors and was built of solid marble with a stained glass fan window over the entrance door. It had four floors, five different parlours, and fifteen bedrooms with attached bathrooms. The rooms were furnished with chandeliers, potted ferns, and elegant furniture. The house was steam-heated, and each bathroom was supplied with hot and cold water. The interiors of the rooms of Mahogany Hall filled the ads in Blue Books and other advertising pamphlets of the period.

The Hall was forced to close down in 1917 following the closure of Storyville. Originally built for $40,000, it did not sell until 1929, when it fetched just $11,000. The hall became a House for the Unemployed in the mid-1940s until 1949 when it was finally demolished. However, the significance of the Hall can be found in various museums and in the jazz tune &quot;Mahogany Hall Stomp&quot; by Spencer Williams.

==Notable people associated with Storyville==
===Alderman Sidney Story===
Notably the Father of Storyville, Alderman Sidney Story, an American politician, wrote the legislation to set up the District, basing his proposals around other port cities that limited prostitution. Storyville became the nation&#x27;s only legal red-light district, due to Ordinance No. 13,032, which forbade any and all prostitution in New Orleans outside of a tightly defined district in 1897. The original ordinance, written by Story, read:

Story&#x27;s vision allowed authority to regulate prostitution without technically legalizing it. 

===Lulu White===

Lulu White was one of the best known madams in Storyville, running and maintaining Mahogany Hall. She employed 40 prostitutes and sustained a four-story building that housed 15 bedrooms and five parlors. She often found herself in trouble with law enforcement for serving liquor without a license and was known to get violent when another intervened in her practice. Her clients were the most prominent and wealthiest men in Louisiana and she is remembered for her glamour and jewels &quot;which were like the &#x27;lights of the St. Louis Exposition&#x27; just as reported in her promotional booklet&quot;

Prior to leaving New Orleans, White lost $150,000 in her investment schemes following the closure of Storyville.

==Music==
The complexity that occurred during the development of Jazz music was filled with chaos, violence, and an intensity that left an unmistakable mark on Storyville New Orleans. A course of sequences within different colonial control brought on by the French, Spanish, and Anglo-Americans, created a mixed musical atmosphere all over the city. This musical blending gave musicians from different backgrounds the opportunity to perform in the saloons, brothels, dance clubs, and cribs of Storyville.

At the creation of Storyville, black and white musicians were segregated. The red-light district first opened to African Americans who brought their musical background with them. Attributions in the structure of; the Bamboula Rhythm - which is present in Jelly Roll Morton&#x27;s song &quot;Spanish Tinge&quot;, Call and Response conversation of first and second voices in New Orleans Jazz, vocalization of drums in African drum orchestra - which transfers to instruments in early Jazz, and improvisation that is present in west and central African music that persists in Jazz today. The syncopated beat is a particular feature also linked to African music traditions that provided an influence to musicians within Storyville. As time went on and white musicians started to enter Storyville, they increasingly were influenced by black performers. The segregation slowly started to diminish, and sharing their common interest brought the races together in some informal musical ventures. Bands signed to labels remained segregated.

Musicians were hired by madams (owners of the brothel houses) to entertain clients within the mansion&#x27;s parlors. These audiences tended to not be very critical, giving performers the freedom to experiment with their musical styles. Performers such as Jelly Roll Morton, and Manuel Manetta played piano all times of the day and night, which was customary within these brothel houses. At the same time dance halls and saloons would hold the attention of their patrons with ragtime dance bands. The experimentation and technique advancement within Storyville made its style exceptional during this time in history.

With the closing of Storyville in 1917, the New Orleans musicians who had relied on the district for employment were still able to develop their style and evolve within the New Orleans tourism industry. The appeal of music and vice gave New Orleans favorable money-making conditions and opportunities to play on riverboats and tours. Some of the musicians did leave the city, spreading their musical talents and knowledge to other cities such as Chicago expanding the rhythms of Jazz across the United States.

==Closure==
In 1908, a train-route connecting Canal and Basin Street was completed, centralizing the location of Storyville in New Orleans. This new train station was located adjacent to the District, leading to citizens&#x27; groups protesting its continuance. Prostitutes, often naked, would wave to the train&#x27;s passengers from their balconies.

At the beginning of World War I, it was ordered that a brothel could not be located within five miles of a military base. The US Navy, driven by a reformist attitude at home, prohibited soldiers from frequenting prostitutes, based on public health. In October 1917, shortly after the United States entered World War I, Secretary of War Newton D. Baker said:

Aided by the campaigns of the American Social Hygiene Organization, and with army regulations that placed such institutes off limits, he implemented a national program to close so-called &quot;segregated zones&quot; close to Army training camps.

In the early days of the war, four soldiers were killed within the district within weeks of each other. The Army and Navy demanded that Storyville be closed down, with the Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels citing the district as a &quot;bad influence&quot;.

The New Orleans city government strongly protested against closing the district; New Orleans Mayor Martin Behrman said, &quot;You can make it illegal, but you can&#x27;t make it unpopular.&quot; He then ordered the District be shut down by midnight of November 12, 1917. After that time, separate black and white underground houses of prostitution were set up around the city.

The district continued in a more subdued state as an entertainment center through the 1920s, with various dance halls, cabarets and restaurants. Speakeasies, gambling joints and prostitution were also regularly found in the area despite repeated police raids. Prostitution was deemed illegal and came to an end at midnight on November 12, 1917.

==Storyville today==
Almost all the buildings in the former District were demolished in the 1930s during the Great Depression for construction of public housing, known as the Iberville Projects. While much of the area contained old and decayed buildings, the old mansions along Basin Street, some of the finest structures in the city, were also levelled. The city government wanted to change the area by demolition and new construction. Basin Street was renamed &quot;North Saratoga&quot; (its historic name was restored some 20 years later).

Today there are three known buildings that still exist from the Storyville time period: Lulu White&#x27;s Saloon, Joe Victor&#x27;s Saloon, and Tark &quot;Terry&quot; Musa&#x27;s store, formerly known as Frank Early&#x27;s Saloon.

Her paternal grandfather Myung-sook Cho, a Christian minister, worked for the Japanese as a station master during their occupation of Korea. When Japan withdrew from Korea at the end of World War II, he was denounced as a traitor by North Korea&#x27;s Communist regime and forced to move with his family, including his son, Cho&#x27;s father Seung-hoon Cho, to South Korea. During the Korean War, Myung-sook ran an orphanage in Seoul. According to Margaret herself, she &quot;grew up in the church.&quot; She was raised in a racially diverse neighborhood near the Ocean Beach section of San Francisco, which she described as a community of &quot;old hippies, ex-druggies, burn-outs from the 1960s, drag queens, Chinese people and Koreans. To say it was a melting pot – that&#x27;s the least of it. It was a really confusing, enlightening, wonderful time.&quot; Cho&#x27;s parents, Young-Hie and Seung-Hoon Cho, ran Paperback Traffic, a bookstore on Polk Street at California Street in San Francisco. Her father writes joke books and a newspaper column in Seoul, South Korea.

At school, Cho was bullied, saying that &quot;I was hurt because I was different and so sharing my experience of being beaten and hated and called fat and queer and foreign and perverse and gluttonous and lazy and filthy and dishonest and yet all the while remaining invisible heals me, and heals others when they hear it – those who are suffering right now.&quot;

Between the ages of five and twelve, Cho was &quot;sexually molested by a family friend&quot;. On the Loveline May 21, 1997 show with Adam Carolla and Drew Pinsky, she talks about being raped by her uncle while during the same time period he was raping his three-year-old daughter. She often skipped class and got bad grades in ninth and tenth grades, resulting in her expulsion from Lowell High School. Cho said she was &quot;raped continuously through my youngest years&quot; (by another acquaintance) and that when she told someone else about it and her classmates found out, she received hostile remarks justifying it, including accusations of being &quot;so fat&quot; that only a crazy person would have sex with her.

After Cho expressed an interest in performance, she auditioned and was accepted into the San Francisco School of the Arts, a San Francisco public high school for the arts. While at the school, she became involved with the school&#x27;s improvisational comedy group alongside actors Sam Rockwell and Aisha Tyler.

At age 15, she worked as a phone sex operator, and she later worked as a dominatrix. After graduating from high school, Cho attended San Francisco State University, studying drama, but she did not graduate.

==Career==
===1992–95: Early stand-up and &quot;All-American Girl&quot;===
After doing several shows in a club adjacent to her parents&#x27; bookstore, Cho launched a stand-up comedy career and spent several years developing her material in clubs. Cho&#x27;s career began to build after appearances on television and university campuses. In 1992, she appeared on the unsuccessful &quot;Golden Girls&quot; spin-off &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; in a small role. In 1993, Cho won the American Comedy Award for Best Female Comedian. In 2010, on &quot;The View&quot;, she discussed her nervousness about doing &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; and thanked the late Rue McClanahan for her help with rehearsing. She also secured a coveted spot as opening act for Jerry Seinfeld; at about this time, she was featured on a Bob Hope special, and was also a frequent visitor to &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show.&quot;

That same year, ABC developed and aired a sitcom based on Cho&#x27;s stand-up routine. The show, titled &quot;All-American Girl,&quot; was initially promoted as the first show prominently featuring an East Asian family, although the short-lived sitcom &quot;Mr. T and Tina,&quot; which had starred Noriyuki &quot;Pat&quot; Morita as Mr. T., preceded it by nearly two decades.

Cho has expressed subsequent regret for much of what transpired during the production of the show, specifically:
* After network executives, especially executive producer Gail Berman, criticized her appearance and the roundness of her face, Cho starved herself for several weeks. Her rapid weight loss, done to modify her appearance by the time the pilot episode was filmed, caused kidney failure.
* The show suffered criticism from within the U.S. East Asian community over its perception of stereotyping. Producers told Cho at different times during production both that she was &quot;too Asian&quot; and that she was &quot;not Asian enough.&quot; At one point during the course of the show, producers hired a coach to teach Cho how to &quot;be more Asian.&quot;
* Much of the humor was broad and coarse, and at times, stereotypical portrayals of her close Korean relatives and gay bookshop customers were employed.

The show was canceled after suffering poor ratings and the effect of major content changes over the course of its single season (19 episodes).

After the show&#x27;s 1995 cancellation, Cho became addicted to drugs and alcohol. As detailed in her 2002 autobiography, &quot;I&#x27;m the One That I Want,&quot; in 1995, her substance abuse was evident during a performance in Monroe, Louisiana, where she was booed off the stage by 800 college students after going on the stage drunk.

===1995–2002: Stand-up, acting, and writing===

Though her career and personal life were challenging after the show&#x27;s cancellation, Cho eventually sobered up, refocused her energy, and developed new material. She hosted the &quot;New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve 95&quot; show with Steve Harvey. In 1997, she had a supporting role in the thriller film &quot;Face/Off&quot; starring Nicolas Cage and John Travolta, playing Wanda, one of the fellow FBI agents of Travolta&#x27;s primary character.

In 1999, she wrote about her struggles with &quot;All-American Girl&quot; in her first one-woman show, &quot;I&#x27;m the One That I Want.&quot; That year, &quot;I&#x27;m the One That I Want&quot; won &quot;New York&quot; magazine&#x27;s Performance of the Year award and was named one of the Great Performances of the year by &quot;Entertainment Weekly.&quot; At the same time, Cho wrote and published an autobiographical book with the same title, and the show itself was filmed and released as a concert film in 2000. Her material dealt with her difficulties breaking into show business because of her ethnicity and weight and her resulting struggle with and triumph over body image issues and drug and alcohol addiction. Cho also appeared in an episode of the HBO comedy &quot;Sex and the City&#x27;s&quot; fourth season. The episode, titled &quot;The Real Me,&quot; first aired on June 3, 2001, and also guest-starred Heidi Klum.

In 2004, the show &quot;Notorious C.H.O.&quot; (the title was derived from slain rapper The Notorious B.I.G.) referred to the comedian having been reared in 1970s San Francisco and her bisexuality. After completing &quot;Notorious C.H.O.&quot;, she made another stand-up film, &quot;Revolution,&quot; released in 2004, and subsequently work on her first self-written film in which she starred. &quot;Bam Bam and Celeste,&quot; a low-budget comedy about a &quot;fag hag&quot; and her gay best friend, co-starred Cho&#x27;s friend and co-touring act Bruce Daniels. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2005. On Valentine&#x27;s Day of 2004, Cho spoke at the Marriage Equality Rally at the California State Capitol. Her speech can be seen in the documentary &quot;Freedom to Marry.&quot;

===2005–2010: Other projects and television===
In 2005, Cho released her second book, &quot;I Have Chosen to Stay and Fight,&quot; a compilation of essays and prose about global politics, human rights, and other topical issues. Cho launched a national book tour in support of the collection. An audio reading of the book was also released. A DVD of a live taping of her &quot;Assassin&quot; tour was released in conjunction with the book. The same year, Cho started promoting and touring with her new show, &quot;Assassin.&quot; The show became her fourth live concert film and premiered on the gay and lesbian premium cable network Here! TV in September 2005. In this DVD, she notably includes herself when talking about gay people, saying &quot;we&quot; and &quot;our community.&quot; Posters for &quot;Assassin&quot; featured Cho in paratrooper gear and holding a microphone in the style of an automatic rifle, a reference to the infamous 1974 photo of heiress Patty Hearst.

Cho launched &quot;The Sensuous Woman,&quot; a burlesque-style variety show tour, in Los Angeles on August 10, 2007, with tour dates scheduled through November 3, as of October 10. Scheduled tour stops meant to follow Los Angeles were Chicago, Illinois and New York City. On August 10, 2007 the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reviewed the show, Cho&#x27;s work, key events in her personal life and characterized the show thus: &quot;In fact, as bawdy and bad-behaving as the cast gets, the whole show feels more like a crazy family reunion than a performance.&quot;

Also in 2007, Cho appeared in The Dresden Dolls&#x27; video of their song &quot;Shores of California,&quot; which was MCed by Amanda Palmer and in The Cliks&#x27;s video for &quot;Eyes in the Back of My Head,&quot; in which she appeared as Lucas Silveira&#x27;s lover. She also provided the character voice for a character named Condie Ling on the Logo animated series &quot;Rick &amp; Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World.&quot; Her episodes began airing in 2007.

The premiere performance of Cho&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful&quot; tour was on February 28, 2008, in Sydney, Australia as part of the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Festival. Cho was also the Chief of Parade for the festival&#x27;s annual parade along Oxford Street on March 1. During her stay in Sydney, Cho was filmed shopping for parade outfits in a drag store with Kathy Griffin and Cyndi Lauper for Griffin&#x27;s Bravo series &quot;My Life on the D-List.&quot; The episode featuring Cho aired on June 26, 2008.

Cho and her family and friends appeared in an episode of NBC&#x27;s series &quot;Celebrity Family Feud,&quot; which premiered on June 24, 2008. Later that summer, she appeared in her own semi-scripted reality sitcom for VH1, &quot;The Cho Show,&quot; which premiered on August 21, 2008 and lasted one season. She next appeared in the supporting cast of the series &quot;Drop Dead Diva,&quot; which debuted in July 2009.

===2011–present: Further appearances and tours===
In April 2011, Cho guest starred on the comedy &quot;30 Rock&quot; in the episode &quot;Everything Sunny All the Time Always.&quot; She portrayed Kim Jong-Il, then the leader of North Korea, that required her to speak both Korean and English. She was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. She later returned to portray Kim Jong-Il&#x27;s son, Kim Jong-Un. [S:6, E:21] In 2010, Cho was a contestant on the 11th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars.&quot;

Also in 2011, Cho played a lead role in &quot;America 2049&quot;, a Facebook-integrated game highlighting social inequities in a dystopian future.

Since January 2013, Cho has been the co-host of the weekly podcast &quot;Monsters of Talk&quot; along with Jim Short. Cho embarked on her &quot;Mother&quot; tour in the fall of 2013 and slated it for engagements in Europe in 2014. The title of the tour refers not to Cho&#x27;s impressions of her own mother, but to Cho herself. It is her nickname for the figure she has played to her many gay friends over the years. In 2014, she participated in &quot;Do I Sound Gay?&quot;, a documentary film directed and produced by David Thorpe. The film is about stereotypes of gay men&#x27;s speech patterns.

In January 2019, Cho competed in season one of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Poodle&quot;. She was eliminated in Episode 4.

In July 2019, Cho started a solo podcast called &quot;The Margaret Cho&quot;, which features guests who primarily work in show business. Guests have included &quot;Queer Eye&quot;&#x27;s Jonathan Van Ness, tattooist and reality TV figure Kat Von D, screenwriter Diablo Cody, drag queen Jackie Beat, and comedian and TV host Michael Yo. Cho has a chapter giving advice in Tim Ferriss&#x27; book Tools of Titans.

In February 2022, she was cast in the documentary series &quot;Everything&#x27;s Gonna Be All White&quot;, airing on Showtime.

In June 2022, Cho co-starred in a romantic comedy film, &quot;Fire Island&quot;, directed by Andrew Ahn, airing on Hulu.

In November 2023, Cho was a guest on Today with Hoda &amp; Jenna&quot;, as they recounted her career and celebrated her life&#x27;s work and inspiration to other comedians.

== Comedic style and political advocacy ==

Cho is also well known for discussing her relationship with her mother, particularly in imitating her mother&#x27;s heavily accented speech. Her depictions of &quot;Mommy&quot; have become a popular part of her routine. Cho&#x27;s comedy routines are often explicit. She has covered substance abuse, eating disorders, her bisexuality and obsession with gay men, and Asian-American stereotypes, among other subjects, in her stand-up routines.

A substantial segment of her material and advocacy addresses LGBT issues. In addition to her shows, Cho also developed an additional outlet for her advocacy with the advent of her website and her daily blog. When San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom directed that San Francisco&#x27;s city hall issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in San Francisco in 2004 (until reversed by the state supreme court), Cho started &quot;Love is Love is Love,&quot; a website promoting the legalization of gay marriage in the United States.

Cho&#x27;s material often features commentary on politics and contemporary American culture. She has also been outspoken about her dislike of former President George W. Bush. She began to draw intense fire from conservatives over her fiercely anti-Bush commentary; a live performance in Houston, Texas, was threatened with picketing. Although protesters never showed up, she held a counter-protest outside the club until security told her she had to go inside.

In 2004, Cho was performing at a corporate event in a hotel when, after ten minutes, her microphone was cut off and a band was instructed to begin playing. Cho claims that this was because the manager of the hotel was offended by anti-Bush administration comments. Cho&#x27;s payment, which was issued by way of check directly to a non-profit organization, a defense fund for the West Memphis Three, initially bounced but was eventually honored.

In July 2004, during the Democratic National Convention, Cho was disinvited to speak at a Human Rights Campaign/National Stonewall Democrats fundraiser out of fear that her comments might cause controversy. In November 2005, she campaigned to pardon Stanley Tookie Williams, an early Crips gang leader, for his death sentence for four murders, but this campaign failed; on December 13, 2005, after exhausting all forms of appeal, Williams was executed by lethal injection at San Quentin State Prison, California.

In 2007, Cho hosted the multi-artist True Colors Tour, which traveled through 15 cities in the United States and Canada. The tour, sponsored by the Logo channel, began on June 8, 2007. Headlined by Cyndi Lauper, the tour also included Debbie Harry, Erasure, The Gossip, Rufus Wainwright, The Dresden Dolls, The MisShapes, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, Indigo Girls, The Cliks, and other special guests. Profits from the tour helped to benefit the Human Rights Campaign as well as PFLAG and The Matthew Shepard Foundation.

On January 25, 2008, Cho officially gave her support to Barack Obama for the nomination on the Democratic ticket for the 2008 U.S. presidential election. After Republican Presidential candidate John McCain announced his running mate, Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska, Cho said of her, &quot;I think [Palin] is the worst thing to happen to America since 9/11.&quot;

After same-sex marriage became legal in California in May 2008, Cho was deputized by the City of San Francisco to perform marriages there.

==Other ventures==
===Fashion and burlesque===

In 2003, Cho founded a clothing line with friend and fashion designer Ava Stander called High Class Cho. The company eventually went defunct.

In 2004, Cho took up bellydancing and in 2006 started her own line of bellydancing belts and accessories called Hip Wear; these she sold through her website. She also had extensive tattooing done to cover the majority of her back.

In November 2006, Cho joined the board of Good Vibrations, a sex toy retailer. With fellow comedian Diana Yanez, she co-wrote &quot;My Puss&quot;, a rap song which they recorded as the duo of &quot;Maureen and Angela.&quot; Cho appeared in and directed the music video for the song. In December 2006, Cho appeared on the Sci-Fi Channel&#x27;s miniseries &quot;The Lost Room&quot; as Suzie Kang.

On an episode of &quot;The Hour&quot; with host George Stroumboulopoulos, Cho mentioned that she loved Broken Social Scene and wishes to be a part of the band (offering to play the rainstick or the triangle). On air, Stroumboulopoulos called band member Kevin Drew from his cell phone, and Cho made her request to join the band via his voicemail.

In April 2009, Cho was photographed by photographer Austin Young and appeared in a Bettie Page–inspired &quot;Heaven Bound&quot; art show.

===Music===
In September 2008, Cho released her single, &quot;I Cho Am a Woman,&quot; on iTunes. The song, produced by Desmond Child, was featured on her VH1 series.

Throughout 2010, she worked on a full-length album, going through the titles &quot;Guitarded&quot; and &quot;Banjovi&quot; before finally settling on &quot;Cho Dependent.&quot; Released on August 24, 2010, the album was supported by music videos for &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry,&quot; &quot;Eat Shit and Die,&quot; and &quot;My Lil&#x27; Wayne;&quot; Liam Kyle Sullivan directed the first two. It was nominated for a 2010 Grammy award for Best Comedy Album. In 2011 Showtime released a stand-up comedy special, titled &quot;Margaret Cho: Cho Dependent,&quot; which featured musical performances from the album.

In May 2010, Cho directed and appeared in, the music video for &quot;I Wanna Be a Bear,&quot; a song by &quot;Pixie Herculon,&quot; a pseudonym of Jill Sobule. In 2011, Cho sang the Bob Mould song &quot;Your Favorite Thing&quot; at the tribute concert &quot;See A Little Light&quot; with Grant-Lee Phillips. In the same year she appeared in some of Liam Kyle Sullivan&#x27;s YouTube videos. 

In July 2014, she appeared in &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s music video for &quot;Tacky.&quot;

In April 2016, Cho released her second album, &quot;American Myth&quot;.

In May 2016, she rapped on and made an appearance in the music video for &quot;Green Tea&quot;, a song by rapper Awkwafina. Both play with stereotypes of people of East Asian descent in hopes that &quot;women of color embrace their quirkiness, their sexuality, their inner child and their creativity with passion.&quot;

Also in 2016, Cho was featured on the track &quot;Ride or Die&quot; on the album &quot;Sweet T&quot; by American drag queen and singer/artist Ginger Minj.

On December 6, 2024 Cho released the single &quot;Lucky Gift&quot;. Produced by Garrison Starr, the track went out to digital platforms in advance of Cho&#x27;s forthcoming album of the same name.

===Podcast===
In July 2019, Cho started a podcast called &quot;The Margaret Cho&quot;. It features guests who primarily work in show business and features original music by Garrison Starr.

==Personal life==
Cho married Al Ridenour, an artist involved in The Cacophony Society and the Art of Bleeding, in 2003. Cho was featured in an Art of Bleeding performance in March 2006. She described her marriage as &quot;very conventional and conservative, I think. I mean we&#x27;re such weird people that people just can&#x27;t imagine that we would have a conventional marriage. But yeah, we are very conventional.&quot; They separated in September, 2014, and Cho confirmed their separation in December. Cho referred to herself as &quot;divorced&quot; in an April 2015 profile in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, but actually filed for divorce in August 2015. In April 2019, it was reported that the divorce was finalized.

In the early 1990s, Cho dated director Quentin Tarantino.

, in a profanity-laced blog post, Cho self-identified as a Christian, although she does not agree with nor align ideologically with mainstream Christianity. , Cho was living in Peachtree City, Georgia, as &quot;Drop Dead Diva&quot; was filmed in the Atlanta area.

Cho is openly bisexual and has stated that she has had &quot;a lot of experience in the area of polyamory and alternative sexuality in general.&quot; When discussing her sexuality in a 2018 &quot;Huffington Post&quot; interview, Cho said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know using &#x27;bisexual&#x27; is right because that indicates that there&#x27;s only two genders and I don&#x27;t believe that. I&#x27;ve been with people all across the spectrum of gender and who have all kinds of different expressions of gender so it&#x27;s so hard to say. Maybe &#x27;pansexual&#x27; is technically the more correct term but I like &#x27;bisexual&#x27; because it&#x27;s kind of &#x27;70s.&quot; Cho states that she &quot;loves&quot; Fire Island and spends summers there. She first learned about sexuality in the 1960s from her parents, who had bought a gay bookstore. In the 1980s, she identified as a lesbian, saying the title at that time had the stereotype of &quot;wearing jean shorts, Doc Martens, a bike chain, a messenger bag and a portable CD player spinning Ani DiFranco&quot;.

Cho was a guest on comedian Bobby Lee&#x27;s &quot;Tigerbelly Podcast&quot; Episode 71, which was uploaded on December 16, 2016. In that episode, she recounted an incident between her and actress Tilda Swinton. According to Cho, Swinton contacted her via email to discuss the Asian American community&#x27;s reaction to the news that Swinton had been cast to play the Ancient One, who in comic books is Tibetan, in the film &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;. Cho found the inquiry odd, since she did not know Swinton and had never talked to her before, nor did she have anything to do with the film or casting. On December 21, Swinton released the email exchange between her and Cho to the website Jezebel. According to Swinton, she had contacted Cho to better understand why Asian Americans were upset about the casting. In response to the release, Cho stated that she stands by her words both on &quot;TigerBelly&quot; and in the email exchange.

Cho revealed in a panel discussion that after doing genealogy testing, she discovered that she had some Chinese ancestry.

Amy Schumer relies a little too much on the word &quot;pussy&quot; to be any kind of threat, though she would like very much to be a bad person. On the other hand, ...

The University of Calgary (U of C or UCalgary) is a public research university located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The University of Calgary started in 1944 as the Calgary branch of the University of Alberta, founded in 1908, prior to being instituted into a separate, autonomous university in 1966. It is composed of 14 faculties and over 85 research institutes and centres. The main campus is located in the northwest quadrant of the city near the Bow River and a smaller south campus is located in the city centre. The main campus houses most of the research facilities and works with provincial and federal research and regulatory agencies, several of which are housed next to the campus such as the Geological Survey of Canada. The main campus covers approximately {{Convert|200|ha}}.

A member of the U15, the University of Calgary is also one of Canada&#x27;s top research universities (based on the number of Canada Research Chairs). The university has a sponsored research revenue of $380.4 million, with total revenues exceeding $1.2 billion. The university maintains close ties to the petroleum and geoscience industry through the Department of Geosciences and the Schulich School of Engineering.{{Explain|date=August 2019|reason=What exactly is the relationship between these industries and the university?}} The university also maintains several other departments and faculties, including the Cumming School of Medicine, the Faculty of Arts, the School of Public Policy, the Faculty of Law, and the Haskayne School of Business.

Notable former students include Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Java programming language creator James Gosling, Uber co-founder Garrett Camp, astronaut Robert Thirsk, and Lululemon Athletica founder Chip Wilson. The university has produced over 170,000 alumni who reside in 152 countries.

==History==

The University of Calgary was established in 1966, but its roots date back more than half a century earlier to the establishment of the Normal School in Calgary in 1905. The Alberta Normal School was established in Calgary to train primary and secondary school teachers in the new province. The Calgary Normal School was absorbed by the University of Alberta&#x27;s Faculty of Education in 1945, and operated as a part of its Calgary branch campus, a satellite campus of the University of Alberta. Operating from the west wing of the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art, the Calgary University Committee was formed 1946, in an effort to lobby for separate permanent facilities for the branch campus.

In July 1957, the University of Alberta signed a one dollar lease with the City of Calgary, for {{convert|121.4|hectare|acre|round=5}} of land. In 1958, the University of Alberta changed the name of the branch campus to the &quot;University of Alberta in Calgary,&quot; and unveiled plans for new permanent facilities on the leased land. The new campus opened its first permanent facilities in October 1960, the Arts and Education Building (presently the Administration Building), and the Science and Engineering Building (presently Science A).

In May 1965, the satellite campus was granted academic and financial autonomy from the University of Alberta. In the following year, in April 1966, the institution was formally made into an independent university, with the passage of the &quot;Universities Act&quot; by the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. The university was modelled on the American state university (similar to the University of Alberta), with an emphasis on extension work and applied research. The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was a link between the bodies to perform institutional leadership.

In the early 20th century, professional education expanded beyond theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced. The university&#x27;s first president, Herbert Stoker Armstrong, held a strong belief that &quot;although the university is accountable to the society that supports it, the university must insist on playing a leadership role in intellectual matters if it is to be worthy of the name.&quot;

During the late 1960s, the University of Calgary&#x27;s campus expanded dramatically with new buildings for engineering and science, the opening of the new University Theatre in Calgary Hall and, in 1971, the launch of the program in architecture. In addition, the Banff Centre (originally known as The Banff School of Fine Arts) affiliated with the University of Calgary in 1966.

The University of Calgary played a central role in facilitating and hosting Canada&#x27;s first winter olympic games, the XV Olympic Winter Games in 1988.

===21st century===
In May 2001, the University of Calgary tartan was accredited in a ceremony presided over by the president of the Scottish Tartans Society, and the director of the Register of All Publicly Known Tartans. The accreditation ceremony for the university&#x27;s tartan was the first to take place in Canada. Use of the black, red, and gold tartan is limited to formal ceremonies, convocations, and a small number of items sold by the university. The tartan is also used by the university&#x27;s pipe band.

The school was the target of a ransomware attack in 2016. The university paid a $20,000 ransom to the cyber criminals. The FBI charged the alleged Iranian hackers in 2018.

On January 4, 2018, 21-year-old Connor Neurauter was sentenced to 90 days in jail and two years probation, and had to register as a sex offender in Kamloops, B.C. It was then revealed that Neurauter would not serve his sentence until May 2018, in order to allow him to finish his semester at the University of Calgary. On January 6, the University of Calgary said that they were &quot;reviewing the situation&quot; and he had been advised to not be on campus the week of January 8. On January 9, a petition on change.org was started and as of January 12, had obtained over 65,000 signatures calling for the University of Calgary to expel him. The University of Calgary released a statement on January 11 stating they had no plans to expel Neurauter, but saying he had been advised to stay off campus for the remainder of the semester and that he would be escorted off campus if he appeared. The university received criticism for its decision to not expel Neurauter and its handling of the case in light of its new sexual assault policy. The decision to have Neurauter&#x27;s sentence delayed in order for him to attend has also received criticism.

====West Campus Development Project====

In 2007, the University of Calgary, in partnership with the City of Calgary, began work on the West Campus Development Project through the West Campus Development Trust. As the lead developer for University District, the trust will oversee the development of the lands adjacent to the main campus, formerly known as the West Campus lands.

The primary goal of the trust is to manage the transforming of previously unused University lands, with the ultimate aim to generate a financial return on investment for the university&#x27;s academic mission. Once completed, University District, situated between the university and Shaganappi Trail, will be a mixed-use, 200-acre community consisting of residential, office, retail and park spaces. As of 2021, a number of condominium and commercial buildings had been completed, with commercial development anchored by a major grocery store.

====MacKimmie Complex Redevelopment Project====

The MacKimmie Complex and Professional Faculties Redevelopment Project is an ongoing multi-phase project to enhance the university&#x27;s administrative and academic environments. The completed project will include the construction of new classrooms, centralized student services, student study space, and expanded academic research space. The new block also serves as the home for the Hunter Hub for Entrepreneurial Thinking.

Initial funding for project design and planning was announced in April 2016 by the Government of Alberta. On March 23, 2017, an additional amount of $262.8M was announced by the Government to be allocated over the next four years for the MacKimmie Complex and Professional Faculties Building Redevelopment.

==Administration==
The governance of the University of Calgary is conducted through a board of governors and a senate. The role of the board of governors and the senate is governed under the &quot;Post Secondary Learning Act&quot;, a provincial act of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. The board of governors is responsible for the university&#x27;s conduct, management, and control of the university and its property, revenues, business, and other affairs. Members of the board of governors include the chancellor of the university, the university president, two alumni nominated by the alumni association, a member of the university senate, nine members of the general public, as well as three students, and three staff members nominated by their respective associations.

The University Senate acts as an outreach body between the university and the wider community. The university&#x27;s senate is made up of 62 members of the alumni association, academic staff, the student body, and the general public, as identified by the &quot;Post-Secondary Learning Act&quot;. Members of the senate include various members of the university community, including the university president, the chief academic officer of student affairs, academic staff, as well a one undergraduate and graduate student appointed by their respective student association. In addition to members of the university community, the senate also includes nine members of the general public, appointed by the Alberta Minister of Advanced Education. In relation to its mandate, the university senate is also the governing body that authorizes issuance of honorary degrees.

The university senate is chaired by the university chancellor. In addition to chairing the senate, the chancellor also presides over all degree-conferring ceremonies, and acts as the ambassador for the university.

The university&#x27;s support staff are represented by the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees, organized as Local 052 University of Calgary chapter. In October 2008, the University of Calgary was named one of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Top 100 Employers&quot; by Mediacorp Canada Inc. Later that month, the university was also named one of Alberta&#x27;s Top Employers.

==Academics==

The university offers 250 programs in post-secondary education awarding bachelors, masters, and doctorate (PhD) degrees. The University of Calgary has developed a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs. The campus has an area of {{Convert|200|ha|acres}} and hosts 14 faculties, 55 departments and 85 research institutes and centre (see Canadian university scientific research organizations).

The university is accredited through Alberta&#x27;s Post-Secondary Learning Act and is considered a &quot;comprehensive academic and research university&quot; (CARU). CARUs offer a range of academic and professional programs, which generally lead to undergraduate and graduate level credentials, and have a strong research focus.

MacKimmie library was the first library to open at the University of Calgary in 1966. Since then, five different library branches have been opened in order to provide students with a greater amount of literary choice in many subjects. In addition, the University of Calgary has the first library system in North America to contain a video game library. Over 3.7 million printed volumes combined with online access to more than 300,000 full-text electronic journals and more than 800 electronic databases are available at the university. As of 2012, the library system is the eighth largest, by the number of volumes held, in Canada. In 2011–2012 the university library was rated 43rd in North America for Total Library Expenditures by the Association of Research Libraries.

====Branch libraries====
The library system at the University of Calgary has eight library locations in total:

* Taylor Family Digital Library – contains the greatest share of the library system&#x27;s printed volumes, as well as rare special items like a gaming collection. In 2011 The Taylor Family Digital Library replaced, as the university&#x27;s primary facility, the MacKimmie Library, which is no longer used as a library.
** Data Library
** Canadian Architectural Archives
** Fine Arts and Visual Resources
* High Density Library – located at the university&#x27;s Spy Hill Campus, serves as a climate-controlled repository for lesser-used materials, which may be called-back for use as required.
* Business Library
* Doucette Education Library
* Bennett Jones Law Library
*Health Sciences Library
*Gallagher Library (Sciences and Engineering)
* The Military Museums Library and Archives

====Taylor Family Digital Library====
The Taylor Family Digital Library (TFDL) is a convergence of libraries, historical archives, arts museum, scholarly publishing, and student academic support services. The TFDL was officially launched on October 20, 2011. The TFDL allows the full re-engineering of the university&#x27;s library system, creating more and better space for teaching and learning resources, while moving the majority of the University of Calgary&#x27;s growing collection off campus to a high-density library. In addition, The TFDL offers books and online resources, a large Learning Commons with café, workrooms, film and audio rooms, editing and recording suites, multimedia labs, quiet study areas, and seminar and consultation space for academic growth.

Don and Ruth Taylor (couple), longtime supporters of the University of Calgary, donated $25 million in December, 2006 to help build the new digital library. In recognition of the gift, the board of governors of the university named the library the Taylor Family Digital Library (TFDL).

In addition, the gift will also be used to create the Taylor Quadrangle, a green space in the centre of campus adjacent to the TFDL.

The Taylor Family Digital Library is home to the Nickle Galleries, formerly known as the Nickle Arts Museum, which features exhibits of contemporary art, as well as rugs, textiles, and numismatic items from its collections. Many events are also held there, ranging from tours to recorded talks.

===Taylor Institute for Teaching and Learning===

In celebration of the university&#x27;s 50th anniversary, the University of Calgary launched the Taylor Institute for Teaching and Learning (TITL), which was built on the site of the former Nickle Arts Museum.

The building was constructed as a two-storey, 4,000 m2 environmentally sustainable building to accommodate the increasing the needs of the university. It features advanced teaching technology tools, mock classrooms, a simulation centre for teaching, public lecture space, and multipurpose facilities.

The TITL provides education and teaching workshops and events for teachers and students to attend and further refine their educational goals. The institute also confers several awards and grants, including the University of Calgary Teaching Award and the PURE Awards for undergraduate research.

===Innovate Calgary===

The University of Calgary announced in 2010 the creation of a dedicated university-based incubator to provide working space and laboratory access for university spin-offs. 
The resulting incubator, known as Innovate Calgary, is based out of the 170,000-square-foot Alastair Ross Technology Centre located within the innovation research park. The research park is adjacent to the primary main campus and is open to any university-linked entrepreneurs.

Opportunity Calgary Investment Fund (OCIF) donated over $8.5M to help provide programs and support for university linked startups. In addition to providing startup programs and services, Innovate Calgary also operates as the tech transfer office for the university by providing Intellectual property (IP) support and services. Innovate Calgary has an informal partnership with Creative Destruction Lab (CDL) to identify and support regional startups with demonstrated potential.

== Campuses ==
===Main Campus===

The university grounds lie about {{convert|10|km|mi}} northwest of Downtown Calgary, and immediately south of the neighbourhood of Varsity. The University of Calgary campus occupies {{convert|213|ha|acre|lk=in}} or {{convert|2.13|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, an area larger than Calgary&#x27;s entire downtown. The campus is bounded by Crowchild Trail, 32 Avenue NW, Shaganappi Trail NW, and 24 Avenue N.W..

The architecture is defined by a combination of Brutalist and Postmodern buildings spread across campus, most of them built between 1960 and 1980. In 2016, the campus finished repurposing and renovating the Canadian Natural Resources Limited Engineering Complex situated within the Schulich School of Engineering. In 2017, the university has recently started on rehabilitating the aging MacKimmie Complex.

The main campus is connected to Calgary&#x27;s C-Train light-rail system at University Station.

A large park is built in the centre of the main campus, and is home to several specially commissioned sculptures. In addition, a pond surrounded by benches and an open field is available. The park contains old oak trees which were specially transplanted to the location when the university was opened. Together, they form a considerable amount of tree canopies which add a more natural feeling to the campus.

===West Campus===

In 1995, the Province of Alberta gave the University of Calgary a large tract of land west of the Main Campus with the understanding it would be used in the future to advance the university&#x27;s mission, vision, values and priorities. About a third of the size of downtown Calgary, the land overlooks the Bow River valley and covers {{convert|80|ha|acre|0}} east of Shaganappi Trail between 16th Avenue (TransCanada Highway) and 32 Avenue N.W. The western campus lies on mostly hilly terrain, near the Bow River. It is adjacent to the main campus of the university, and is home to the Alberta Children&#x27;s Hospital and Child Development Centre. With the recent boost in annual funding, the university has begun a development plan in order to make better use of the remaining space. Dubbed the University District, the area is to include a mixture of residential and commercial development.

Part of the West Campus was leased for the new Alberta Children&#x27;s Hospital and a new Ronald McDonald House. Currently, the campus is only halfway developed and is considered building room for the future. From this location, it is possible to see the entire university and also Downtown Calgary.

===Health Sciences Campus===
The University of Calgary Board of Governors chose to launch a medical school in the late 1960s, with the first tangible building to house this endeavor being the Health Sciences Building, which opened in 1972. The Health Sciences Building shared a site with the Foothills Medical Centre some distance south of the Main Campus. This site became known as the Health Sciences Campus, with subsequent additions being the Heritage Medical Building (opened 1987), the Health Research Innovation Centre and the Teaching, Research and Wellness building.

The Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases is also housed there, and after an interruption of several years and in light of the COVID-19 pandemic reopened in November 2020 its Biosafety level 3 laboratory. The university received a $427,785 grant from the Government of Canada to promote COVID-19 vaccine confidence and competence in communication and uptake among health professionals in training.

===Downtown Campus===

On September 13, 2010, the University of Calgary opened its new downtown campus located at 8th Avenue and 8th Street S.W.. The building houses classes including Continuing Education, and energy &amp; environment, as well as classes offered by the Haskayne School of Business and the School of Public Policy. It also houses administrative offices for the Development and Alumni Engagement division and the main office of the University of Calgary Alumni association; beginning in 2020, however, most of these personnel were relocated to the Main Campus. It also includes a conference centre. At one point it also included a branch of the university library, but this was decommissioned and converted into additional student study space in 2016. The University of Alberta currently houses its MSc Physical Therapy – Calgary program in this building.

==== School of Public Policy ====

The School of Public Policy is an institute at the University of Calgary and was founded in 2008 and now based out of the Downtown Campus. The school is devoted to public policy research and education, and is led by economist Dr. Jack Mintz who is cross-appointed to the Faculty of Law. It is home to over 60 faculty and fellows. The school is organized into three policy areas: Economic and Social Policy, Energy and Environmental Policy, and International Policy. Since 2012 the school has offered a graduate degree program, the Master of Public Policy. The degree is structured as a 12-month program involving two semesters of classroom-based learning and one semester of project work. Other degree programs offered include a joint Master of Business Administration/Master of Public Policy and a joint Juris Doctor/Master of Public Policy.

=== Spy Hill Campus ===
The university also operates a satellite campus in the far northwest corner of Calgary on 85 Street N.W. The campus is home to the university&#x27;s new Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, and the High-Density Library, a climate-controlled warehouse for books and other printed material for which there is no longer storage room at the main library.

===Qatar Campus===

In 2007, the University of Calgary established a campus in Doha, Qatar, the University of Calgary in Qatar (UCQ), which currently focuses upon nursing education. The University of Calgary in Qatar offers a flexible, innovative, Bachelor of Nursing (BN) degree to prepare students for the opportunities and challenges of a rewarding nursing career. Throughout the program, students are provided with a theoretical base and supervised clinical experience in a variety of nursing practice settings.

The University of Calgary in Qatar offers two routes towards a Bachelor of Nursing (BN) degree:

*A Regular Track program for high school – Qatar transfer students (BNRT)
*A Post-Diploma program for students with an acceptable Nursing diploma (PDBN)
The University of Calgary in Qatar also offers a Diploma of Nursing program that launched in September 2012.

In addition, several graduate programs are expected to be phased in. Currently the University of Calgary in Qatar campus offers a Master of Nursing program which is sponsored by the Hamad Medical Corporation with focuses in Nursing Leadership and Oncology.

==Student life==
===The Den and Black Lounge===

Once run by the University of Calgary, the Den was taken over by the Students&#x27; Union in 2000.

===The Last Defence Lounge===
The Last Defence Lounge (LDL) is a fully licensed restaurant operated by the Graduate Students&#x27; Association of the University of Calgary. It is open to undergraduate and graduate students, as well as faculty, staff and members of the public.

===Campus traditions===

* Bermuda Shorts Day (BSD) was an annual end-of-term tradition for the University of Calgary, usually celebrated around the close of the winter semester every April. As the name suggests, students traditionally wore Bermuda shorts. Recent trends however have seen the rise of bright-neon and floral attire instead of the short formal trouser. The event was notorious for turning the campus, for one day only, into a giant festival of alcohol consumption and day-party concerts. Bermuda Shorts Day has not been hosted since 2019, with the Student&#x27;s Union citing the then-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and financial constraints, and the University of Calgary believing that celebrations, including the consumption of alcohol, contributed to an unprofessional environment.
* UCalgaryStrong Festival is an annual end-of-term celebration at the University of Calgary, which has acted as an alternative to Bermuda Shorts Day following its discontinuation in 2019. It is described as &quot;a safe and alcohol-free way for the entire community to enjoy the semester coming to an end,&quot; and often includes live music, games, and food selections.

===Greek life===
{{See also|Fraternities and sororities in Canada}}

As such, the chapter has been contributing to campus life for over five decades. Zeta Psi – Chi Gamma has several hundred alumni that continue to support both the active chapter as well as the University of Calgary. For over 40 years the Zete Haus has provided economical student housing and has been a focal point for Greek life, being the closest chapter house to campus at approximately 500 meters from MacEwan Hall. The Chi Gamma chapter reactivated in 2014 with 20 members, after having been deactivated in 2008 due to a lack of competitiveness on campus. The active and alumni chapters of Chi Gamma collectively celebrated their fiftieth anniversary on December 9, 2017.

Top students in the Schulich School of Engineering are recognized as Schulich Scholars and are awarded prestigious Schulich Entrance Scholarships. The first cohort of Schulich Scholars graduated in 2010–2011.

Students enrolled in the Bachelor of Health Sciences Program are eligible for the O&#x27;Brien Centre Continuing Scholarship, which supports full-time students dedicated to extra-curricular involvement and the community on top of their academics.

Graduate students are also eligible for the prestigious Queen Elizabeth II Graduate Scholarships. Awards are available in thirds, two-thirds, or full increments, and are valued at $10,800 at the Master&#x27;s level and $15,000 at the PhD level.

<text>Jeffrey Bertan Cohen ( McMahon; June 25, 1974) is an American attorney and retired child actor best remembered for appearing as Chunk in the 1985 Steven Spielberg production &quot;The Goonies&quot;. He is a founding partner of law firm Cohen &amp; Gardner.

==Early life, family and education==
Cohen was born Jeffrey Bertan McMahon on June 25, 1974, in Los Angeles, California. He took his stage name from the maiden name of his mother, Elaine Cohen. He is Jewish.

Cohen attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in business. Cohen asked &quot;Goonies&quot; director Richard Donner for a recommendation for his college admissions application. Upon reading Cohen’s notes detailing some of his early life struggles, Donner and his wife offered to pay for Cohen’s college education. Cohen later earned a Juris Doctor from the UCLA School of Law.

== Entertainment career ==

=== Acting ===
Cohen was one of the children describing words to the contestants on the 1982–83 CBS game show &quot;Child&#x27;s Play.&quot; During the summer of 1985, he appeared as a celebrity on &quot;Body Language&quot;. In 1986, he was also in the Disney TV movie &quot;Ask Max&quot;. Cohen&#x27;s sister, Eydie Faye, is a playwright and actress. In the final scene of &quot;The Goonies&quot;, when the families gather on the beach, Faye has a cameo as Chunk&#x27;s sister.

Cohen claimed in &quot;The Goonies&quot; DVD commentary track that every role he played as a child had him wearing either a Hawaiian shirt or a pair of plaid pants, and director Richard Donner had the idea to put him in both for &quot;The Goonies&quot;. Before &quot;The Goonies&quot; started filming, Cohen contracted chickenpox. Afraid that they would re-cast the role, he told no one of his illness and showed up to work anyway. According to the commentary track on &quot;The Goonies&quot; DVD, the chickenpox on Cohen&#x27;s chest can be seen during the &quot;Truffle Shuffle&quot; sequence.

=== Law ===
Cohen used introductions from &quot;Goonies&quot; director Richard Donner to get summer jobs on the business side of movie studios; he would say about that time in the &quot;ABA Journal&quot; story, &quot;I grew up loving The Three Stooges and the Marx Brothers, but suddenly I had a new crop of heroes.&quot; He chose to pursue a legal career upon finding out that many of the most important figures on the business side of Hollywood had law degrees. 

After his time at Berkeley, Cohen earned a J.D. degree from the UCLA School of Law in 2000 and later became an entertainment lawyer in Los Angeles. In 2002, he co-founded the Cohen &amp; Gardner firm in Beverly Hills. In the September 24, 2008 issue of &quot;Variety&quot;, Cohen was profiled in the Dealmakers Impact Report. 

Additionally, Cohen was named to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s &quot;Next Generation: Hollywood&#x27;s Top 35 Executives 35 and Under&quot; in their 2008 November 5 issue. Cohen was named to &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s Dealmakers Impact Report in 2013.

As of February 2014, he periodically &quot;writes about business, legal and political matters for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; and CNBC.&quot;

Cohen negotiated the deal of his &quot;Goonies&quot; co-star Ke Huy Quan for his casting in &quot;Everything Everywhere All At Once&quot; (2022). Cohen was in attendance at the 95th Academy Awards where Quan won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor; Quan publicly thanked Cohen during his acceptance speech, calling him his &quot;&quot;Goonies&quot; brother for life.&quot;

<text>The term child actor or child actress is generally applied to a child acting on stage, television, or in movies. An adult who began their acting career as a child may also be called a child actor, or a &quot;former child actor&quot;. Closely associated terms include teenage actor or teen actor, an actor who gained popularity as a teenager.

Famous earlier examples include Elizabeth Taylor, who started as a child star in the early 1940s in productions like &quot;National Velvet&quot; before becoming a popular film star as an adult in movies.

Many child actors find themselves struggling to adapt as they become adults, mainly due to typecasting. Macaulay Culkin and Lindsay Lohan are two particularly famous child actors who eventually experienced much difficulty with the fame they acquired at an early age. Some child actors have successful acting careers as adults; for example Mickey Rooney, Tim Matheson, Drew Barrymore, Shia LaBeouf, Jake Gyllenhaal, Mila Kunis, and Molly Ringwald. Other child actors have gone on to successful careers in other fields, including director Ron Howard, politicians Lech and Jarosław Kaczyński, and singer Jenny Lewis.

==Regulation==
In the United States, the activities of child actors are regulated by the governing labor union, if any, and state laws. Some projects film in distant locations specifically to evade regulations intended to protect the child. Longer work hours or risky stunts prohibited by California, for example, might be permitted to a project filming in British Columbia. US federal law &quot;specifically exempted minors working in the entertainment business from all provisions of the child labor Laws.&quot; Any regulation of child actors is governed by disparate state laws.

===California===
Due to the large presence of the entertainment industry in Hollywood, the state of California has some of the most explicit laws protecting child actors. Being a minor, a child actor must secure an entertainment work permit before accepting any paid work. Compulsory education laws mandate that the education of the child actor not be disrupted while the child is working, whether the child actor is enrolled in public school, private school or even home school. The child does their schoolwork under the supervision of a studio teacher while on the set.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, a child actor is defined as an actor under school leaving age. Before a child can work, they require a performance license from their Local Education Authority as well as a licensed chaperone; a parent can only chaperone their own child, and a chaperone&#x27;s duties include acting &quot;in loco parentis&quot; and recording arrivals and departure time from the work place, the time a child is working, their breaks, and the amount of tutoring. A child requires minimum of three hours of tutoring daily and a lesson must be a minimum of 30 minutes to count towards the total and with regards to 18 and 19-year-old in further education, considerations are made in regards to their studies.

There are regulations and guidance to safeguard all actors under the age of 20; Ofcom guidance states a child or young person&#x27;s health and safety, well-being and welfare are paramount in television production and factors such as their age, maturity and life experiences can affect their performance. Ofcom also advises that broadcasters undertake risk assessments, consider seeking expert advice and follow best practices.

==Issues==
===Ownership of earnings===
In the United States before the 1930s, many child actors never got to see the money they earned because they were not in charge of this money. Jackie Coogan earned millions of dollars from working as a child actor only to see most of it squandered by his parents. In 1939, California weighed in on this controversy and enacted the Coogan Bill, which requires a portion of the earnings of a child to be preserved in a special savings account called a blocked trust. A trust that is not actively monitored can also be problematic, however, as in the case of Gary Coleman, who after working from 1974, later sued his adoptive parents and former business advisor for $3.8 million over misappropriation of his trust fund.

===Competitive pressure===
Some people also criticize the parents of child actors for allowing their children to work, believing that more &quot;normal&quot; activities should be the staple during the childhood years. Others observe that competition is present in all areas of a child&#x27;s life—from sports to student newspaper to orchestra and band—and believe that the work ethic instilled or the talent developed accrues to the child&#x27;s benefit.

The child actor may experience unique and negative pressures when working under tight production schedules. Large projects which depend for their success on the ability of the child to deliver an effective performance add to the pressure.

Ethel Merman, who several times worked in long-running stage productions with child actors, disliked what she eventually saw as their over-professionalization—&quot;acting more like midgets than children&quot;—and disapproved of parents pushing adulthood on them.

==After the childhood success==

There are many instances of troubled adult lives due to the stressful environment to which child actors are subjected. It is common to see a child actor grow up in front of the camera, whether in films, television shows or both. However, it is not uncommon to see child actors continue their careers as actors or in a different professional field.

Jodie Foster started acting at age 3, becoming the quintessential child actor during the 1970s with roles in films such as &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; (1973), &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; (1974), &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; (1976), &quot;The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane&quot; (1976), and &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; (1976). A child prodigy, Foster received her first Academy Award nomination at age 13 and later took a sabbatical from films to attend Yale University. She made a successful transition to adult roles, winning two Academy Awards for Best Actress before the age of 30, and starring in several successful and acclaimed films such as &quot;The Accused&quot; (1988), &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991), &quot;Nell&quot; (1994), &quot;Maverick&quot; (1994), &quot;Contact&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Brave One&quot; (2007), thus establishing herself as one of the most accomplished and sought-after actresses of her generation. She has also ventured into directing and her directing credits include films such as &quot;Little Man Tate&quot; (1991), &quot;Money Monster&quot; (2016) and television shows such as &quot;House of Cards&quot;, &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;, and &quot;Black Mirror&quot;.

Now adults, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, the three leads of the acclaimed &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series (2001–2011), starred in every instalment in the series, and have since continued to act in film, television, and theater in their early 30s.

Dakota Fanning rose to prominence after her breakthrough performance at age 7 in the film &quot;I Am Sam&quot; (2001). Her performance earned her a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination at age 8 in 2002, making her the youngest nominee in SAG history. She later appeared in major Hollywood productions, in such acclaimed blockbuster films as &quot;Man on Fire&quot; (2004), &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; (2005), &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; (2006), &quot;Hounddog&quot; (2007), &quot;The Secret Life of Bees&quot; (2008), &quot;Coraline&quot; (2009), &quot;The Twilight Saga&quot; film series (2009–2012), &quot;The Runaways&quot; (2010), and &quot;The Motel Life&quot; (2012). Fanning&#x27;s younger sister, Elle Fanning, also rose to prominence as a child actress, having appeared in many films since before she turned 3.

Miranda Cosgrove, known mainly for her role as Megan on the Nickelodeon sitcom &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot; as a child, gained more attention for her role as a teenager in the show &quot;iCarly&quot;. Since the end of the show she has been featured in other roles, including as the voice of Margo in the &quot;Despicable Me&quot; franchise. Once she was of age, she decided to pursue a college degree in film at the University of Southern California.

Raven-Symoné had childhood stardom for her roles on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot; but would achieve mainstream breakthrough with her role as Raven Baxter in the Disney Channel sitcom &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; and &quot;The Cheetah Girls&quot; films as Galleria. After both projects ended, Raven would star in &quot;Revenge of the Bridesmaids&quot;, the short-lived &quot;State of Georgia&quot; and had a long running voiceover gig as Iridessa in the &quot;Tinker Bell&quot; series but after her run on Broadway&#x27;s &quot;Sister Act&quot; in 2012, she briefly retired and enrolled at the Academy of Art University earning her degree in fine arts and later returned to the industry to become a co host on &quot;The View&quot; and returned to the Disney Channel for the spinoff &quot;Raven&#x27;s Home&quot;.

Late actress Shirley Temple became a public figure and diplomat, beginning in the 1960s. Some of her duties included representing the United Nations, and becoming a U.S. ambassador in countries such as Ghana and Czechoslovakia.

Mary-Kate Olsen, who shared the role of Michelle Tanner with her twin sister Ashley on the ABC sitcom &quot;Full House&quot;, was treated for an eating disorder, deemed anorexia, but Ashley remained less troubled. In an article with the magazine &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, Mary-Kate expressed the bittersweet nature of the twins&#x27; childhood. &quot;I look at old photos of me, and I don&#x27;t feel connected to them at all,&quot; she said. &quot;I would never wish my upbringing on anyone... but I wouldn&#x27;t take it back for the world.&quot; The twins eventually retired from acting to pursue a full-time career in the fashion industry, which, to this day, is continuously successful with an estimated net worth of approximately $100,000,000.

Drew Barrymore, a former child star, started acting at age 3. During her childhood she battled with drugs, but recovered and currently continues to act.

Natalie Portman took a small break in acting to get a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology from Harvard University before continuing her career as an actress.

Rider Strong, known as &quot;Shawn Hunter&quot; in &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, was educated at Columbia University and now runs a successful blog and has published a graphic novel. Neil Patrick Harris started his career as a child actor in &quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot; He continues to act in television, films and theater. Harris is now a cult figure icon.

Jonathan Lipnicki, known mostly for the &quot;Stuart Little&quot; films, now successfully competes in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Sara Gilbert is known for her role on &quot;Roseanne&quot; and later created and served as a co-host for CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Talk&quot;. Also from &quot;Roseanne&quot;, Michael Fishman continued to work in film, but behind the scenes and has since been nominated for an Emmy for the work he did in &quot;Sports Science&quot;. Both Gilbert and Fishman returned for the later series based on &quot;Roseanne&quot;, &quot;The Conners&quot;, with Gilbert also serving as an executive producer and guiding the series through its transition after Roseanne Barr was fired after the tenth season of the revived &quot;Roseanne&quot;. Kirsten Dunst and Lacey Chabert both made the transition from a child actress to an adult actress with a rough patch including depression. After a stay in a rehabilitation center, Dunst was able to recover and continue her career. She proves that the pressures of growing up under the spotlight may not come without repercussions.

Other examples are Roddy McDowall, who had a long and outstanding career, including as the regular star of the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; series; Micky Dolenz, who started his career as a child star in the 1950s and who grew up to be a musician of the successful 1960s pop group The Monkees, which had its own successful television show; Ron Howard, who, in addition to being the star of both of the long running &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; and &quot;Happy Days&quot; television series, became an Academy Award-winning director in adulthood; and Elijah Wood, who continued his career successfully into adulthood, starring as Frodo Baggins in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series and starring as Ryan Newman in the television series &quot;Wilfred&quot;.

===Other careers===

Many actors&#x27; and child actors&#x27; careers are often quite short. Many actors, out of personal choice, that start their careers as child actors decide not to pursue the same careers as adults. Shirley Temple, for example, became a public figure and diplomat. Peter Ostrum, appearing in his only role, the lead character of Charlie Bucket in &quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, became a large-scale veterinarian surgeon. While Jenny Lewis, formerly of film &quot;Troop Beverly Hills&quot; in 1989, is a well-known singer-songwriter indie rock musician. Renee Olstead became a jazz musician.

In Poland, former child actors and identical twin brothers Lech and Jarosław Kaczyński became successful politicians, at one time Lech being president and Jarosław the prime minister.

RuPaul&#x27;s Guide to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Style&quot; (2010), &quot;GuRu&quot; (2018), and &quot;The House of Hidden Meanings&quot; (2024).

==Early life==

RuPaul was born in San Diego on November 17, 1960, the son of Ernestine &quot;Toni&quot; (née Fontenette) and Irving Andrew Charles. His parents were both from Louisiana. He was named by his mother; &quot;Ru&quot; came from &quot;roux&quot;, the French term for the base of gumbo and other creole stews and soups. According to DNA analysis by &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; staff, his ancestry is 70% African and 30% European.

After his parents divorced in 1967, RuPaul and his three sisters lived with their mother, a Seventh-day Adventist. He was raised in the Catholic faith and attended Patrick Henry High School. At 15, RuPaul and his sister Renetta moved to Atlanta, where they studied performing arts.

== Career ==

=== 1980–1995: Beginnings and &quot;Supermodel of the World&quot; ===
RuPaul struggled as a musician and filmmaker during the 1980s, working at Atlanta&#x27;s Plaza Theatre. In 1982, he debuted on an Atlanta public access variety show called &quot;The American Music Show&quot;, and went on to appear on the show frequently. He also took part in underground cinema, helping create the low-budget film &quot;Star Booty&quot; and an album of the same name. In Atlanta he often performed at the Celebrity Club, managed by Larry Tee, as a bar dancer or with his band, Wee Wee Pole. RuPaul also performed as a backup singer to Glen Meadmore along with drag queen Vaginal Davis. His first prominent national exposure came in 1989, when he danced as an extra in the video for The B-52s&#x27; &quot;Love Shack&quot;.

In the early 1990s, RuPaul worked the Georgia club scene and was known by his full birth name. Initially participating in gender bender-style performances, he performed solo and in collaboration with other bands at several New York City nightclubs, most notably the Pyramid Club. He played opposite New York City drag performer Mona Foot (Nashom Benjamin) in the one-act science-fiction parody &quot;My Pet Homo&quot;, written and directed by Jon Michael Johnson for Cooper Square Productions. He performed for many years at the annual Wigstock drag festival and appeared in the documentary &quot;&quot;. In the 1990s, RuPaul appeared on the UK Channel 4 series &quot;Manhattan Cable&quot;, a weekly series produced by World of Wonder and presented by American Laurie Pike about New York&#x27;s public-access television system.

In 1993, RuPaul recorded the dance/house album &quot;Supermodel of the World&quot;. It was released through the rap label Tommy Boy, spawning the dance track hit &quot;Supermodel (You Better Work)&quot;. The song peaked at 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It charted on the UK Singles Chart, peaking on the top 40 at 39. The song found the most success on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, where it peaked at 2. Radio airplay, heavy rotation of the music video on MTV, and television appearances on popular programs like &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; popularized the song. His next two singles/videos, &quot;Back to My Roots&quot; and &quot;A Shade Shady (Now Prance)&quot;, both went to the top spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. His following release &quot;House of Love&quot; failed to place on any U.S. charts but peaked at 68 on the UK Singles Chart. In 1994, he released &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Breaking My Heart&quot;, a duet with Elton John.

RuPaul was signed to a modeling contract for MAC Cosmetics. Various billboards featured him in full drag, often with the text &quot;I am the MAC girl&quot;. He also released his autobiography, &quot;Lettin&#x27; It All Hang Out&quot;. He promoted the book in part with a 1995 guest appearance on ABC&#x27;s &quot;All My Children&quot;, in a storyline that put it on the set of Erica Kane&#x27;s talk show &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot;. The same year, he was featured in his first of two appearances in the &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; movies, in which he played Jan&#x27;s female guidance counselor.

=== 1996–2007: &quot;Foxy Lady&quot; and &quot;Red Hot&quot; ===
In 1996, he landed a talk show of his own on VH1, called &quot;The RuPaul Show&quot; interviewing celebrity guests and musical acts. Cher, Diana Ross, Nirvana, Duran Duran, Pat Benatar, Mary J. Blige, Bea Arthur, Dionne Warwick, Cyndi Lauper, Olivia Newton-John, Beenie Man, Pete Burns, Bow Wow Wow, and the Backstreet Boys were notable guests. His co-host was Michelle Visage with whom he also co-hosted on WKTU radio. On one episode, RuPaul featured guests Chi Chi LaRue and Tom Chase speaking about the gay porn industry.

Later in the year he released his second album, &quot;Foxy Lady&quot;, this time on the L.A.-based Rhino Records label. The album failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. However, its first single &quot;Snapshot&quot; went to number four on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. It also enjoyed limited mainstream success, charting at 95 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, which was his second and final solo Hot 100 entry to date. The album&#x27;s second single &quot;A Little Bit of Love&quot; was not as successful, peaking at 28 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. During this time, RuPaul hosted a morning radio show at WKTU radio in New York City and would serve as host until 1998.
In 1997, he released his third album, the Christmas-themed &quot;Ho Ho Ho&quot;. That year, RuPaul teamed with Martha Wash to remake the classic disco anthem, &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot;. The song was included on the 1998 compilation CD &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Go Go Box Classics&quot;. During this time, he appeared in Webex TV commercials and magazine ads. In 2002, he was featured on the Eurodance track &quot;You&#x27;re No Lady&quot; alongside Brigitte Nielsen.

In 2004, RuPaul released his fourth album, &quot;Red Hot&quot; on his own RuCo Inc. music label. It received dance radio and club play, but very little press coverage. RuPaul later noted, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what happened. It seemed I couldn&#x27;t get press on my album unless I was willing to play into the role that the mainstream press has assigned to gay people, which is as servants of straight ideals.&quot; &quot;Red Hot&quot;&#x27;s lead single &quot;Looking Good, Feeling Gorgeous&quot; peaked at number two on the dance chart. The second, &quot;WorkOut&quot;, peaked at number five. The third and final single from the album &quot;People Are People&quot; a duet with Tom Trujillo, peaked at number 10. The album itself only charted on the Top Electronic Albums chart, where it hit number nine. In September, he was hired at WNEW.

On June 13, 2006, RuPaul released &quot;ReWorked&quot;, his first remix album. The only single released from the album was a re-recording of &quot;Supermodel (You Better Work)&quot;, which reached number 21 on the U.S. dance chart. June 20, 2007, saw the release of &quot;Starrbooty: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; in the United States. The single &quot;Call Me Starrbooty&quot; was digitally released in 2007. The album contains new tracks as well as interludes with dialogue from the movie. The film was released on DVD in October 2007.

===2008–2013: &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, &quot;Champion&quot;, and &quot;Glamazon&quot;===

In mid-2008, RuPaul began producing &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, a reality television game show which aired on Logo in February 2009. On the program drag queens compete to be selected by RuPaul and a panel of judges as &quot;America&#x27;s next drag superstar&quot;. The first season&#x27;s winner was BeBe Zahara Benet, and first runner-up Nina Flowers was chosen by fans as &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; through voting via the show&#x27;s official website. To publicize the new show, RuPaul appeared on several other shows in 2008, including &quot;Project Runway&quot;, as guest judge, and on &quot;Paula&#x27;s Party&quot; as a guest &quot;chef&quot;.

In March 2009, RuPaul released the album &quot;Champion&quot;. The album spawned four singles &quot;Cover Girl&quot;, &quot;Jealous of My Boogie&quot;, &quot;Devil Made Me Do It&quot;, and &quot;Tranny Chaser&quot;. The album peaked at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance/Electronic Albums as well as 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart. Logo&#x27;s second annual NewNowNext Awards in 2009 were hosted by RuPaul. There he performed &quot;Jealous of My Boogie (Gomi &amp; RasJek Edit)&quot;. In March 2010, RuPaul released his second remix album, &quot;Drag Race&quot;, the album features remixes of songs from the 2009 album &quot;Champion&quot;.

In April 2011, coinciding with the finale of season 3 of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, RuPaul released his sixth studio album &quot;Glamazon&quot;, produced by Revolucian. The album charted on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Dance/Electronic Albums and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart at 11 and 8 respectively. In July 2011, he released another remix EP entitled &quot;SuperGlam DQ&quot; which features remixes of tracks from &quot;Glamazon&quot;, remixes of the &quot;&quot;Drag U&quot; Theme Song&quot;, and a new song, &quot;Sexy Drag Queen&quot;. The second season of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag U&quot; began in June 2011. In late 2011, RuPaul made appearances on &quot;The Rosie Show&quot; and &quot;The Chew&quot;, and also attended a &quot;Drag Race&quot; NY Premiere party at Patricia Field&#x27;s store in New York. Season 4 of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; premiered on Logo on January 30, 2012, with RuPaul returning as the main host and judge. In the fall of 2012, the spin-off &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race All Stars&quot; premiered and featured past contestants of the previous four seasons. Season 5 of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; premiered on January 28, 2013. On April 30, 2013, he released &quot;Lick It Lollipop&quot; featuring Lady Bunny.

In fall of 2013, RuPaul joined forces with cosmetic manufacturers Colorevolution to launch his debut make-up line featuring ultra-rich pigment cosmetics and a beauty collection. Released alongside the line was a unisex perfume entitled &quot;Glamazon&quot;. Talking to World of Wonder he said: &quot;Glamazon is for women and men of all ages and preferences who share one thing in common: They are not afraid to be fierce. For me, glamour should be accessible to all, and I am committed to helping the world look and smell more beautiful.&quot; The line was exclusively sold on the Colorevolution website in various gift sets.

==Other ventures==
===Podcasting===
The podcast &quot;&quot; debuted on April 6, 2014. Ru-Paul co-hosts with longtime friend and fellow &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; judge Michelle Visage. The weekly show features their thoughts on topics including behind-the-scenes of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, life advice, beauty tips, and conversations with featured guests from the entertainment world.

===Audiobooks===
In 2018, RuPaul was one of the actors who voiced the audiobook &quot;A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo&quot;.

===Drag conventions===
Launched through production company World of Wonder, RuPaul&#x27;s DragCon LA is an annual drag-themed convention held in Los Angeles which started in 2015, followed by RuPaul&#x27;s DragCon NYC. It began in 2017 in New York City; the public is able to meet with RuPaul, former &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; contestants, and other drag queens. The conventions feature performances, meet-and-greet booths, merchandise sales and panel discussions.

=== Activism ===
RuPaul has been an active supporter of voter registration, producing a public service announcement supporting National Voter Registration Day and urging everyone to register. As RuPaul said voter ID laws vary from state to state; the details of the voter ID required in each state are provided by HeadCount and VoteRiders. As one in five LGBTQ adults are not registered to vote, voter registration efforts have expanded recently. Several stars from &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; act as Ambassadors for Drag Out the Vote.

In March 2023, in response to the Tennessee Adult Entertainment Act, RuPaul, World of Wonder producers Randy Barbarto and Fenton Bailey, and MTV began a fund to fight anti-drag initiatives. The ACLU maintains the fund, which received donations from efforts at DragCon LA 2023, the &quot;Drag Isn&#x27;t Dangerous&quot; livestream telethon, &quot;Can&#x27;t Hold us Down&quot;, &quot;Born This Way&quot;, and &quot;God Save the Queens&quot;, as well as a small donation from the Manhattan Association of Cabarets.

The Instagram post RuPaul made prior to the establishment of the fund called on followers to vote, saying, &quot;Register to vote so we can get those stunt queens out of office.&quot; The video ends with the statement, &quot;By the way, a social media post has never been as powerful as a registered vote.&quot;

==Impact==
Lauren Herold of &quot;Mic.com&quot; deemed RuPaul &quot;arguably the most commercially successful drag queen in America.&quot; Sami Main of &quot;Adweek&quot; credited him with creating wider exposure for drag queens from LGBT culture into mainstream society, thanks to his early-career chart success, and later, the successive climb in viewership of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;. His talk show &quot;The RuPaul Show&quot; was the first-ever national talk show to have a drag queen as a host. Along with his partner Michelle Visage, he welcomed an array of high-profile guests such as Cher, Lil Kim, and Diana Ross over the show&#x27;s 100-episode span. As well as having a variety of comedy skits, the show was noted for discussing topics such as black empowerment, female empowerment, misogyny, and liberal politics that were otherwise unheard of in 1990s television at the time. In 1999, RuPaul was awarded the Vito Russo Award at the GLAAD Media Awards for work in promoting equality in the LGBT community.

RuPaul has also been noted as having a large part in &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;″s continuous television success. By pioneering queer representation on television, many believe RuPaul to have essentially revolutionised the portrayal of the LGBTQ+ community on screen. He first won an Emmy for his work on the show in 2016, and one year later the show garnered eight nominations, including Outstanding Reality-Competition Program for the first time in its 11-season run, and a second consecutive win for RuPaul in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. In 2017, he was included in the annual &quot;Time&quot; 100 list of the most influential people in the world. In 2019, &quot;Fortune&quot; noted RuPaul as &quot;easily the world&#x27;s most famous&quot; drag queen.

=== Relationship with transgender community ===
RuPaul has been the subject of multiple controversies regarding his comments and actions towards the transgender community. According to &quot;Vox&quot;, he has a complicated relationship with this community, in part due to differing philosophies: through drag he seeks to mock gender and identity stereotypes, while in his view the trans community takes identity seriously. Nevertheless, &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; has featured a number of contestants who are trans women, including Sonique, Carmen Carrera, Jiggly Caliente, Monica Beverly Hillz, Kenya Michaels, and Gia Gunn, some of whom made their identity public while competing on the show. Later seasons of the show have included contestants who had already disclosed their trans identity prior to their season beginning. In 2017, Peppermint became the first contestant to compete throughout her season as an openly trans woman and in 2021 Gottmik was the first to compete as an openly trans man. Other non-conforming gender identities expressed by former contestants include both non-binary (Jinkx Monsoon, Aja, Valentina, Divina de Campo, Ginny Lemon, Violet Chachki, and Sasha Velour) and genderfluid (Courtney Act and Kelly Mantle) persons.

In 2014, trans activists and former contestants Carmen Carrera and Monica Beverly Hillz criticized the show&#x27;s use of words such as &quot;tranny&quot; and &quot;shemale&quot;, including the main challenge announcement phrase up to season 6, &quot;You&#x27;ve got she-mail&quot;, which they described as transphobic. That year&#x27;s season also included a &quot;Female or She-male&quot; segment that required contestants to guess whether various photographs featured cisgender &quot;biological women&quot; or &quot;psychological women&quot; (drag queens), causing further criticism. RuPaul and the producers issued a statement promising &quot;to help spread love, acceptance and understanding&quot; and Logo TV removed the &quot;You&#x27;ve got she-mail&quot; phrase from subsequent broadcasts, replacing it instead with the phrase &quot;She done already done had herses.&quot; RuPaul criticized those attempting to police his language in bad faith and noted that &quot;tranny&quot; referred to transvestites and drag queens, not just trans women.

In 2018, RuPaul gave an interview to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in which he stated that a post-transition trans woman would &quot;probably not&quot; be accepted onto the show, noting that at the time of competition Peppermint had not yet had breast implants. After facing criticism on social media and from former contestants for his remarks, RuPaul compared trans drag queens who had transitioned to athletes who had taken performance-enhancing drugs. He subsequently expressed regret for the hurt caused by his remarks, and that the only screening criteria for contestants were &quot;charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent.&quot; Since he made these statements, multiple transgender contestants have competed on the show.

==Personal life==
RuPaul met painter Georges LeBar in 1994 at the Limelight nightclub in New York City. They married in January 2017. They have an open marriage; RuPaul has said he would not want to &quot;put restraints&quot; on the person he loves. The two split their time between a home in Los Angeles and a ranch in Wyoming. Environmentalists criticized them in 2020 after RuPaul revealed that they lease mineral rights and sell water to oil companies on their ranch, and allow fracking there. According to public maps, the ranch has at least 35 active wells. RuPaul previously held a climate-themed ball on his show to raise environmental awareness, leading to accusations of hypocrisy.

RuPaul publicly endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He expressed dismay at Clinton&#x27;s defeat by Republican nominee Donald Trump, saying, &quot;The America that we have all fought so hard for, the narrative of love and peace and liberty and equality, it feels like it is dead.&quot; He has described doing drag as a &quot;very, very political&quot; act because it &quot;challenges the &quot;status quo&quot;&quot; by rejecting fixed identities: &quot;Drag says &#x27;I&#x27;m a shapeshifter, I do whatever the hell I want at any given time&#x27;.&quot;

RuPaul started smoking cannabis at age 10 or 11. Since 1999, he has been sober and has not had alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. In 2020, he found out while appearing on the TV show &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; that he and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker are &quot;DNA cousins.&quot; In a 2013 interview, RuPaul said, &quot;I&#x27;m not religious, but I do have spiritual practices like yoga and meditation and I do pray.&quot;

<text>The World Almanac and Book of Facts is a US-published reference work, an almanac conveying information about such subjects as world changes, tragedies, and sports feats. It has been published yearly from 1868 to 1875, and again every year since 1886.

==History==
===19th century===

The first edition of &quot;The World Almanac&quot; was published by the &quot;New York World&quot; newspaper in 1868 (the name of the publication comes from the newspaper itself, which was known as the &quot;World&quot;). Published three years after the end of the Civil War and the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, its 120 pages of information touched on such events as the process of Reconstruction and the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson.

Publication was suspended in 1876, but in 1886, newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer, who had purchased the &quot;World&quot; and quickly transformed it into one of the most influential newspapers in the country, revived &quot;The World Almanac&quot; with the intention of making it &quot;a compendium of universal knowledge.&quot; &quot;The World Almanac&quot; has been published annually since. From 1890 to 1934, the &quot;New York World&quot; Building was prominently featured on its cover.
In 1894, when it claimed more than a half-million &quot;habitual users,&quot; &quot;The World Almanac&quot; changed its name to &quot;The World Almanac and Encyclopedia&quot;. This was the title it kept until 1923, when it became &quot;The World Almanac and Book of Facts&quot;, the name it bears today.

===20th century===

In 1906, the &quot;New York Times&quot;, reporting on the publishing of the 20th edition, said that &quot;the almanac has made for itself a secure position, second only to the forty-year-old Whitaker&#x27;s Almanac of London, with which alone it can be compared.&quot;

In 1923, the name changed to its current name, &quot;The World Almanac and Book of Facts&quot;.

Calvin Coolidge&#x27;s father read from &quot;The World Almanac&quot; when he swore his son into office. Since then, photos have shown that Presidents John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton have also used &quot;The World Almanac&quot; as a resource.

In 1931 The &quot;New York World&quot; merged with the Scripps-owned &quot;Telegram&quot; to form the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot;. The &quot;World-Telegram&quot; subsequently acquired the assets of &quot;The Sun&quot; in 1950, and officially became the &quot;New York World-Telegram and The Sun&quot;. Ownership of the &quot;Almanac&quot; passed to the Newspaper Enterprise Association (another Scripps-owned business) in 1966, when the &quot;World-Telegram&quot; merged with the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; and the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot;.

During World War II, &quot;The World Almanac&quot; could boast that it was read by GIs all over the world: between 1944 and 1946, at the request of the U.S. Government, &quot;The World Almanac&quot; had special print runs of 100,000 to 150,000 copies for distribution to the armed forces.

In late December 1984, the 1985 edition reached first place in the category of paperback Advice, How- To and Miscellaneous books, on the &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller list, with more than 1,760,000 copies sold at the time.

The first version of the video game &quot;Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;, published in 1985, included a copy of &quot;The World Almanac&quot; in the purchase.

From the 1968 to 1986 editions the Almanac bore the imprints of local newspapers (in New York, the &quot;Daily News&quot; for most of the time) in various markets while published by NEA.
Thereafter it was branded with &quot;World Almanac Books&quot;, initially as an imprint of Pharos Books, another Scripps-owned entity, until the sales noted below.

Over the decades &quot;The World Almanac&quot; has been featured in several Hollywood films. Fred MacMurray talks about it with Edward G. Robinson in &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;; Bette Davis screams about it in &quot;All About Eve&quot;; Audrey Hepburn and Gary Cooper flirt about it in &quot;Love in the Afternoon&quot;; it is featured in &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; when a trial is held to see if Santa Claus really exists; Rosie Perez continually reads it in the film &quot;White Men Can&#x27;t Jump&quot;; and Will Smith checks it for the exact time of sunset so he can set his digital watch in &quot;I Am Legend&quot;.

&quot;The World Almanac For Kids&quot; was published annually since 1995 until 2014.

In 1993 Scripps sold &quot;The World Almanac&quot; to K-III (later Primedia). &quot;The World Almanac&quot; was sold to Ripplewood Holdings&#x27; WRC Media in 1999. Ripplewood bought &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; and the book was then produced by the World Almanac Education Group, which was owned by The Reader&#x27;s Digest Association.

===21st century===

&quot;The World Almanac&quot; was sold to Infobase in 2009. In 2018, &quot;The World Almanac&quot; published its 150-year anniversary edition. &quot;The World Almanac&quot;, together with the &quot;World Almanac Books&quot; imprint used since the closing years of Scripps ownership, was sold to Skyhorse Publishing in 2020.

As with other Skyhorse imprints it is distributed by Simon &amp; Schuster.

==Editing and publishing==
In the mid-1980s, &quot;The World Almanac&quot; was put together by a ten-member staff. Twenty percent of the book was rarely updated (for example, the text of the Constitution of the United States), fifty percent was updated at least to some extent each year, and thirty percent of the content was completely new each year.

Lists published in &quot;The World Almanac&quot; include:

* &quot;Surprising Facts&quot;
* &quot;Number Ones&quot;
* &quot;Americans By the Numbers&quot;
* &quot;Milestone Birthdays&quot;
* &quot;Notable Quotes&quot;
* &quot;Offbeat News&quot;
* &quot;Historical Anniversaries&quot;

<doc id="89687" wikidata="Q361623" url="?curid=89687" title="Alan Paton">
<text>Alan Stewart Paton (11 January 1903 – 12 April 1988) was a South African writer and anti-apartheid activist. His works include the novels &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot; (1948), &quot;Too Late the Phalarope&quot; (1953), and the short story &quot;The Waste Land&quot;.

==Early life==
Paton was born in Pietermaritzburg in the Colony of Natal (now South Africa&#x27;s KwaZulu-Natal province), the son of a civil servant (who was of Christadelphian belief) and his wife. 

After attending Maritzburg College for high school, Paton earned a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Natal in his hometown. He also got a diploma in education. After graduation, Paton worked as a teacher, first at the Ixopo High School, and subsequently at Maritzburg College.

==Early career==
Paton served as the principal of Diepkloof Reformatory for young (native African) offenders from 1935 to 1949. He introduced controversial &quot;progressive&quot; reforms, including policies on open dormitories, work permits, and home visitation. The young men were initially housed in closed dormitories; once they had proven themselves trustworthy, they would be transferred to open dormitories within the compound. Men who showed great trustworthiness would be permitted to work outside the compound. In some cases, men were permitted to reside outside the compound under the supervision of a care family. Fewer than 5% of the 10,000 men who were given home leave during Paton&#x27;s years at Diepkloof ever broke their trust by failing to return.

==Later career==
Paton volunteered for military service with the British Commonwealth forces during World War II, but was refused by the South African authorities. After the war he took a journey, at his own expense, to tour correctional facilities across the world. He toured Scandinavia, Britain, continental Europe, Canada, and the United States. During his time in Norway, he began work on his seminal novel &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot;, which he completed over the course of his journey, finishing it on Christmas Eve in San Francisco in 1946. There, he met Aubrey and Marigold Burns, who read his manuscript and found a publisher: the editor Maxwell Perkins, noted for editing novels of Ernest Hemingway and Thomas Wolfe, guided Paton&#x27;s first novel through publication with Scribner&#x27;s.

Paton published numerous books in the 1950s and became wealthy from their sales.

On 11 January 2018, a Google Doodle honored the author on what would have been his 115th birthday.

==Opposition to apartheid==
In 1948, four months after the publication of &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot;, the right-wing National Party was elected to power in South Africa. Black South Africans did not receive the vote until 1994 so were unable to oppose this directly. The legislature soon passed laws to formally establish apartheid, a system of racial segregation.

Paton, together with Margaret Ballinger, Edgar Brookes, and Leo Marquard, formed the Liberal Association in early 1953. On 9 May 1953, it became the Liberal Party of South Africa, with Paton as a founding co-president, which fought against the apartheid laws introduced by the National Party government. Alan and his wife Dorrie at times sought shelter from the police, at the safe house of Colin Webb.

Paton served as President of the LPSA until the government forced its dissolution in the late 1960s, officially because its membership comprised both Blacks and Whites. Paton was a friend of Bernard Friedman, founder of the Progressive Party. Paton&#x27;s writer colleague Laurens van der Post, who had moved to England in the 1930s, helped the party in many ways. The South African Secret Police were aware that van der Post was providing money to Paton and the LPSA, but they could not stop it by legal procedures. 

Paton advocated peaceful opposition to apartheid, as did many others in the party. Yet, some LPSA members took a more violent stance. Consequently some stigma attached to the party, not just within South Africa, but also outside the country. The South African government confiscated Paton&#x27;s passport when he returned from New York City in 1960, where he had been presented with the annual Freedom Award. His passport was not returned to him for ten years, making it impossible for him to travel to speak to other countries.

Paton retired to Botha&#x27;s Hill, where he resided until his death. He is honored at the Hall of Freedom of the Liberal International organisation.

==Other works==
Paton continued to explore racial themes and apartheid in his second and third novels, &quot;Too Late the Phalarope&quot; (1953) and &quot;Ah, but Your Land Is Beautiful&quot; (1981), and his collected short stories, &quot;Tales From a Troubled Land&quot; (1961). 

&quot;Ah, but Your Land Is Beautiful&quot; was built on parallel life stories, letters, speeches, news and records in legal proceedings. Its fictional characters interacted with some historic figures, such as Donald Molteno, Albert Luthuli and Hendrik Verwoerd. The novel is classified as historical fiction. It gives an accurate account of the resistance movement in South Africa during the 1960s. 

&quot;Paton attempts to imbue his characters with a humanity not expected of them. In this novel, for example, we meet the supposedly obdurate Afrikaner who contravenes the infamous Immorality Act. There are other Afrikaners, too, who are led by their consciences and not by rules, and regulations promulgated by a faceless, monolithic parliament.&quot;

He also wrote biographies of his friends Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (&quot;Hofmeyr&quot;), and Geoffrey Clayton (&quot;Apartheid and the Archbishop&quot;). Another literary form that interested him throughout his life was poetry.

==Personal life==
While at Ixopo, Paton he met Dorrie Francis Lusted. They married in 1928, and remained together until her death from emphysema in 1967. Their life together is documented in Paton&#x27;s memoir &quot;Kontakion for You Departed,&quot; (1969). They had two sons, Jonathan and David. 

In 1969, Paton remarried, to Anne Hopkins. This marriage lasted until Paton&#x27;s death in 1988.

Paton was a Christian. His faith was one of the reasons he was so strongly opposed to apartheid.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot; was twice adapted for films, has in 1951 and 1995. It was the basis for the Broadway musical &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot;, which was adapted by American playwright Maxwell Anderson, music by Kurt Weill).

<text>Loretta Jane Swit (born Loretta Jane Szwed; November 4, 1937) is an American stage and television actress known for her character roles. Swit is best known for her portrayal of Major Margaret &quot;Hot Lips&quot; Houlihan on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, for which she won two Emmy Awards.

==Early life==
Loretta Swit was born on November 4, 1937, in Passaic, New Jersey, to Lester and Nellie Szwed (née Kassack), who were both of Polish descent. Her father was a salesman and upholsterer. Swit&#x27;s brother, Robert, was six years and one day her senior. As a child, Swit was a member of a Girl Scout troop sponsored by the Holy Rosary R.C. Church of Passaic, known as the Holy Rosary Scouts.

She graduated from Pope Pius XII High School in Passaic in 1955, where she had been a cheerleader, had taken part in theatrical productions, and was co-captain of the women&#x27;s basketball team. She graduated from Katharine Gibbs School in Montclair, New Jersey, in June 1957, then was employed at a variety of clerical jobs, including as a stenographer in Bloomfield, New Jersey; personal secretary to Elsa Maxwell; secretary to the ambassador from Ghana to the United Nations; and at the American Rocket Society in New York City while being trained to dance by a classmate, Elizabeth Parent-Barber, a Rockette and student at the New York School of Ballet. During this time, she began developing her acting career.

She studied drama with Gene Frankel in Manhattan in New York City and considered him her acting coach. She regularly returned to his studio to speak with aspiring actors throughout her career. Swit is also a singer, having trained at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.

==Theatre==
Swit&#x27;s first off-Broadway appearance was in the Actor&#x27;s Playhouse production of &quot;An Enemy of the People.&quot; In 1961, Swit landed a role in the Circle in the Square production of &quot;The Balcony&quot;, written by Jean Genet and produced by José Quintero.

In 1967, Swit toured with the national company of &quot;Any Wednesday&quot;, starring Gardner McKay. She continued as one of the Pigeon sisters opposite Don Rickles and Ernest Borgnine in a Los Angeles run of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;.

In 1975, Swit played in &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot; on Broadway opposite Ted Bessell. She also performed on Broadway during the 1980s in &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;. From there, she played Agnes Gooch in the Las Vegas version of &quot;Mame&quot;, starring Susan Hayward and later, Celeste Holm.

She has played Shirley Valentine, a one-woman play, since the 1990s into the 2010s, appearing in a variety of locales and revivals.

In October–November 2003, she starred as the title character in North Carolina Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;Mame&quot; in Raleigh, North Carolina.

In August–September 2010, Swit starred in the world premiere of the Mark Miller play &quot;Amorous Crossings&quot; at the Alhambra Dinner Theatre in Jacksonville, Florida, directed by Tod Booth.

In 2016, Swit appeared in &quot;Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks&quot; at Totem Pole Playhouse in Fayetteville, Pennsylvania.

In 2017, Swit appeared in &quot;Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks&quot; in Buffalo, New York.

==Television ==
When Swit arrived in Hollywood in 1969, she performed guest roles in various television series, including &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; (her first TV credit), &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Mannix&quot;.

===&quot;M*A*S*H&quot;===
Starting in 1972, Swit played the extremely capable head nurse Major Margaret &quot;Hot Lips&quot; Houlihan in the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, a comedy set in a US Mobile Army Surgical Hospital during the Korean War. Swit inherited the star-making role from actress Sally Kellerman, who had portrayed Houlihan in the feature film. In the first few seasons, her character was single and blindly patriotic, and she had no friends among the camp surgeons and nurses, with the notable exception of her married lover, Major Frank Burns, portrayed by Larry Linville. Over time, her character was considerably softened. She married a lieutenant colonel but divorced soon after. She became good friends with her fellow officers, and her attitude towards the Koreans in and around the camp became more enlightened. The change reflected that of the series in general, from absurdist dark humor to mature comedy-drama. Swit was one of only four cast members to stay for all 11 seasons of the show, from 1972 to 1983 (the others are Alan Alda, Jamie Farr, and William Christopher).

Swit and Alda were the only actors to have been in both the pilot episode and the finale; she appeared in all but 11 of the total of 256 episodes. Swit received two Emmy Awards for her work on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;.

Her favorite episodes are &quot;Hot Lips and Empty Arms&quot;, &quot;Margaret&#x27;s Engagement&quot;, and &quot;The Nurses&quot;.

She also had a close relationship with Harry Morgan, who played Colonel Sherman T. Potter. They became neighbors after the series ended, until his death on December 7, 2011. Swit continues to stay close to Alda, along with his wife, three daughters, and seven grandchildren.

===&quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot;===
In 1981, Swit played the role of Christine Cagney in the movie pilot for the television series &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; but was precluded by contractual obligations from continuing the role. Actress Meg Foster portrayed Cagney for the first six episodes of the television series, then Sharon Gless took over the role.

===Other TV work===
Swit also guest-starred in shows such as &quot;Bonanza&quot;; &quot;The Love Boat&quot;; &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;; &quot;Password&quot;; &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;; &quot;Match Game&quot;; &quot;Pyramid&quot;; &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;; and &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;. In one episode of &quot;Match Game&quot;, Swit wrote the Polish greeting &quot;Dzień dobry&quot; (even with the diacritical mark) on her card during the introduction. She also starred in Christmas programs such as the television version of &quot;The Best Christmas Pageant Ever&quot; and 1987&#x27;s PBS special &quot;A Christmas Calendar&quot;. In 1988, she hosted &quot;Korean War—The Untold Story&quot;, a documentary on the true events of the war, and went to South Korea to film it, becoming the first &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; cast member to actually visit the country, outside of Jamie Farr and Alan Alda, who both served there in the mid-1950s while members of the US Army. In 1992, she hosted the 26-part series &quot;Those Incredible Animals&quot; on the Discovery Channel. Swit&#x27;s latest appearance was on GSN Live on October 10, 2008.

She was also in the TV movie &quot;The Last Day&quot; (1975), with Richard Widmark and Robert Conrad.

Swit guest-starred with Mike Connors in &quot;Mannix&quot;, Episode 78, Season 4, &quot;Figures in a Landscape&quot;, written by Paul Krasny and directed by Donn Mullally, originally airing on October 10, 1970.

Swit guest-starred in the &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; episode &quot;Bait Once, Bait Twice&quot;, on January 4, 1972. She also played Wanda Russell in the &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; episode titled &quot;Three Dead Cows at Makapuu&quot;, which aired February 25, 1970.

==Personal life==

Swit was once linked with musician Bill Hudson. She married actor Dennis Holahan in 1983 and divorced him in 1988. Holahan played Per Johannsen, a Swedish diplomat who became briefly involved with Swit&#x27;s character in an episode of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;.

Swit is an animal rights activist. She was a vegetarian for many years before becoming a vegan in 1981.

Swit wrote a book on needlepoint, titled &quot;A Needlepoint Scrapbook&quot;.

<text>A trailer park, caravan park, mobile home park, mobile home community or manufactured home community is a temporary or permanent area for mobile homes and travel trailers. Advantages include low cost compared to other housing, and quick and easy moving to a new area (for example, when taking a job in a distant place while keeping the same home).

Trailer parks, especially in American culture, are stereotypically viewed as lower income housing for occupants living at or below the poverty line who have low social status. Despite the advances in trailer home technology, the trailer park image survives as evoked by a statement from Presidential adviser James Carville who, in the course of one of the Bill Clinton White House political scandals, suggested: &quot;Drag $100 bills through trailer parks, there&#x27;s no telling what you&#x27;ll find,&quot; in reference to Paula Jones.

Tornadoes and hurricanes often inflict serious damage on trailer parks, usually because the structures are not secured to the ground and their construction much less robust in high winds than regular houses. However, most modern manufactured homes are built to withstand high winds, using hurricane straps and proper foundations.

== By country ==
=== In the United States ===
The negative perception of trailer parks was not improved by the creation of emergency trailer parks by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for the displaced victims of Hurricane Katrina, the quality and temporary nature of which was disputed.

Many stereotypes have developed about residents in trailer parks, which are similar to stereotypes of the poor. The term &quot;trailer trash&quot; is often used in the same vein as the derogatory American terms &quot;white trash&quot; and &quot;ghetto&quot;. Though trailer parks appear throughout the United States, they are often associated with the Deep South and rural areas. In Dover-Foxcroft, Maine, the Town Select Board debated the implementation of a moratorium preventing mobile or manufactured homes from being built or installed. Trailer parks became viewed as a valuable asset in the late 2010s. During that decade, REITs, private equity funds, and middle-class people looking to escape the corporate world bought them up from small mom-and-pop owners.

More recently referred to in the U.S. as &quot;mobile home parks&quot; or &quot;manufactured housing communities&quot;, the stereotypes are often just that. Retirement communities exist in many locales that permit mobile home parks as &quot;55+ parks&quot; in keeping with the Housing for Older Persons Act (HOPA). Generally, at least one homeowner in these communities must be age 55 or over, and those under age 18 are rarely permitted to live there. These can be gated communities with amenities, such as swimming pools, clubhouses and onsite maintenance. Homes are often permanently installed on foundations. But residents may not own the land their homes occupy.

====Corporate investment====
Mobile home parks in the U.S. have become an attractive investment for financial firms such as Carlyle Group, Apollo Global Management and TPG Capital. In the early 2020s, an individual mobile home park can be sold in the tens of millions of dollars. Over 100,000 US mobile home sites were estimated to be owned by large firms in 2019. One firm, Stockbridge Capital Group, owner of about 200 mobile-home parks throughout the US, &quot;saw a return on investment of more than 30 percent between late 2016 and the end of 2017.&quot; The company&#x27;s expansion into this market was facilitated by $1.3 billion in financing from Fannie Mae, which has called mobile homes &quot;inherently affordable.&quot; Profitability for the firms owning the parks has in some cases been tied to rent increases, and has not necessarily translated into good maintenance of the mobile homes. Efforts are being mounted to allow trailer park residents a chance to buy their own trailer park and thus own the land they live on; for instance, in Colorado, trailer park owners must give residents 90 days&#x27; notice before selling. In San Antonio, Texas, residents of the Mission Trails Mobile Home Community negotiated with developer White-Conlee who would be contracted to build luxury condominiums.

=== Outside the United States ===

==== Disputed trailer parks====
While the majority of trailer parks are used as permanent residences, and are paid for in the usual way by residents, a minority are used by nomadic people who in some cases may be occupying them illegally.

In Britain and Ireland, the term halting site is sometimes used for some trailer parks. The biggest difference in Europe is the presence of unauthorised halting sites (or trailer parks). This stems from the practice of traditionally itinerant ethnic groups, such as the Romani and Irish Travellers, to periodically during the year set up a transient community. From the late 1970s onward there was also a growth in New Age travelers culture; these groups espoused alternative lifestyles combined with a Do-It-Yourself punk ethic. The latter were a commonplace phenomenon in Germany, giving rise to expressions such as &quot;Wagenburg&quot;, &quot;Wagendorf&quot;, and &quot;Bauwagenplatz&quot; (&quot;wagon fort&quot;, &quot;trailer village&quot; and &quot;construction trailer site&quot; respectively).

Either rejected from or refusing to seek entrance in municipally authorised halting sites, groups of families practising a nomadic lifestyle would trespass in order to camp on land belonging to local communities. These illegal encampments are often resented by local people, owing to their lack of sewage and waste disposal capacity, and the fact that such encampments are often difficult to remove under human rights legislation. The use of land without permission is also illegal, which leads to such groups being moved on by the police or councils.

====Authorised caravan parks====

In Germany, the Netherlands and some other European countries, local law allows for normal camping at RV parks for a short time and seasonal camping for holidaymakers, and also long-time camping (for years) with hardly movable travel trailers. Sometimes these inhabitants also cultivate a garden. Some cities allow a long-time camping lot to be the regular address registered with the authorities; others do not. Many of mobile home plots are offered by RV parks that allow for all sorts of camping and offer extra plots for mobile homes (static caravans).The cost for such a plot tends to be between €400 and €1.500 a year, depending on the location and facilities.

In France, living in a trailer or mobile home for more than three months is prohibited by law, even if the resident owns the land; however, building requirements and permissions for self building of recreational solid (static) country cottages are more relaxed in France if one stays within a certain amount of square meters.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;trailers&quot; are commonly known as static caravans, and are generally used for one of two purposes: firstly as holiday homes, designed for short-term living; and secondly as retirement homes for the elderly, designed for long-term occupancy. Both types of trailers usually enjoy good amenities and are surrounded by highly manicured gardens.

In Australia, there is generally no differentiation between a trailer park and an RV park. The term &quot;caravan park&quot; is used to refer to both.

<doc id="89691" wikidata="Q726335" url="?curid=89691" title="Jamie Farr">
<text>Jamie Farr (born Jameel Joseph Farah; July 1, 1934) is an American comedian and actor. He is best known for playing Corporal Klinger, a soldier who tried getting discharged from the army by cross-dressing, on the CBS sitcom &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. After &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, Farr reprised the role of Klinger for &quot;AfterMASH&quot; and appeared both in small roles on popular shows such as &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and as a host or panelist on game shows including &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot;. He was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1985.

==Early life==
Farr was born Jameel Joseph Farah () on July 1, 1934 in Toledo, Ohio, the son of Jamelia () and Samuel Farah (). His father, who owned a grocery store, was an immigrant from the Beqaa Valley area of what is now Lebanon and his mother, a seamstress, was a first-generation Lebanese American who grew up in Iowa. Prior to immigrating through Ellis Island, Samuel&#x27;s surname was Abboud and his father&#x27;s first name was Farah. Farr grew up in Northern Toledo, which had a sizeable Lebanese population, in a diverse neighborhood. He was raised Antiochian Orthodox. He had at least one sibling, an older sister, Yvonne, who died in 2012.

His first acting gig was at age 11, when he won two dollars in a local acting competition. While in high school, he worked at his father&#x27;s shop and delivered &quot;The Toledo Times&quot; newspaper in the morning and &quot;The Blade&quot; in the afternoon. He graduated from Woodward High School in 1952 and left for California later that year, where he attended classes at Pasadena Playhouse. It was there that he was spotted by an MGM talent scout and offered a screen test for the film &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot;, where he played the role of Santini. He was credited as Jameel Farah, as he would not take on the name Jamie Farr until 1959 after his stint in the army.
==Career==
While training at Pasadena Playhouse, Farr acted in bit parts including a role in &quot;The Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1955) for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He also worked at a chinchilla farm for extra money. Sherwood Schwartz noticed Farr on an unsold TV pilot and cast him on &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; in 1955, where he played Snorkel, whose large nose gave him an inhumanly strong sense of smell. He became a regular on &quot;Skelton&quot;.He was drafted in 1957, and underwent basic training at Fort Ord in California He was made a Broadcast Specialist and worked on training videos in various roles at Fort Knox, the Army Pictorial Service, and Fort Huachuca before shipping out to Korea. Abroad, he was part of the Special Services and worked on the Far East Network. When Red Skelton traveled to Japan and Korea to do a USO tour, he requested Farr&#x27;s service as his assistant. 

After two years of active duty, Farr returned to the United States, where he spent an additional two years on reserve. Shortly after his return, his father died and he decided to give up acting to help provide steady financial support for his mother. When Farr went to say goodbye to Skelton, Skelton handed him a stack of one hundred dollar bills to send home and told Farr he was hiring him as a writer. Farr completed his military career with an additional two years on inactive reserve.

Over the next decade, Farr had small roles on &quot;The Danny Kaye Show&quot;, &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, and &quot;Garrison&#x27;s Gorillas&quot; and appeared in films including &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;, &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Minding the Mint?&quot;, and &quot;With Six You Get Eggroll&quot;. In October 1972, he was hired for one day&#x27;s work on the fourth episode of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; as Corporal Maxwell Klinger. Klinger provided comic relief in his desperate attempts to be given a Section 8 discharge by wearing elaborate women&#x27;s outfits with accessories such as boas, a fruit hat, and fashion headscarves. At the time, Farr was still a struggling actor and was most concerned about the $250 paycheck from the M*A*S*H job so he could buy groceries and pay rent; he never expected to be invited back for several more episodes. For several years, the producers and the studio dodged his requests for a contract, which Farr suspected was so they didn&#x27;t have to increase his salary. He was finally hired as a series regular on M*A*S*H beginning with season 4 in 1975.
Like Farr, the character of Klinger was a Lebanese-American from Toledo, which gave Farr the freedom to pepper references about the town into his dialogue. He frequently mentioned hot dogs from Tony Packo&#x27;s Cafe and was a fan of the baseball team, the Toledo Mud Hens. Klinger was promoted to the company clerk&#x27;s position later in the series and gradually stopped wearing women&#x27;s clothes. This was done for two reasons: first, to show Klinger&#x27;s respect for his new role and his increased maturity; and second, because Farr didn&#x27;t want his two young children to be teased about their father wearing dresses on TV. By the end of the show, only Alan Alda, who played Hawkeye Pierce, and Loretta Swit, who played Margaret &quot;Hot Lips&quot; Houlihan, had appeared in more &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; episodes than Farr. Farr was also the sole cast member who had actually served in Korea, and the dog tags he wore as Klinger were his own from his time in the service.

During the late 1970s, Farr appeared regularly as one of the celebrity judges on &quot;The Gong Show&quot;. He also made frequent guest appearances on several other game shows, including &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot;, &quot;Super Password&quot;, and &quot;Body Language&quot;. Following the end of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; in 1983, Farr, Harry Morgan, and William Christopher reprised their roles for two seasons on the spinoff show &quot;AfterMASH&quot;, which followed their characters after the end of the war. Between the 1970s and early 1990s, he appeared in several made-for-TV movies such as &quot;Murder Can Hurt You&quot;, &quot;Return of the Rebels&quot;, and &quot;Combat Academy&quot; and guest starred on shows including &quot;&quot;, &quot;Emergency!&quot;, and &quot;Murder She Wrote&quot;. He played the Sheik in &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot;, &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot;, and &quot;Speed Zone&quot; and was the only actor to have appeared in all three &quot;Cannonball Run&quot; films. He also appeared in TV commercials, including for Wonder Bread, Mars bars, and IBM computers.

Farr&#x27;s debut on Broadway was as Nathan Detroit in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; in the 1990s at age 60. He had wanted to play this role since seeing the show in high school. He replaced Nathan Lane in the role last minute, only having two weeks and one full-cast rehearsal before the show opened. In 1997, he played Oscar Madison opposite former &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; costar William Christopher as Felix Unger in &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. The two had appeared in several movies before being cast together in &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;Flamingo Court&quot; opposite Anita Gillette. His other shows have included &quot;Say Goodnight, Gracie&quot;, &quot;The Last Romance&quot;, &quot;George Washington Slept Here&quot;, &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Dress for Dinner&quot;, &quot;Lend Me a Tenor&quot;, &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot;, and &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;.
Between 2007 and 2008, Farr, Chuck Woolery, and Bob Eubanks were rotating hosts of the &quot;$250,000 Game Show Spectacular&quot; at the Las Vegas Hilton. He also hosted a daily radio travel feature called &quot;Travelin&#x27; Farr&quot;. On Memorial Day 2007, Farr hosted a multiple-episode run of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; on the Hallmark Channel where he provided commentary during commercial breaks. Between 2016 and 2018, he promoted &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and other classic television series on MeTV and in 2022 was attending large-scale events like Comic Con to meet fans of the show. The same year, he hosted &quot;M*A*S*H: The Best By Farr&quot;, where he provided commentary on his favorite episodes of the show to celebrate the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Farr published his autobiography &quot;Just Farr Fun&quot; () in 1994 and cowrote &quot;Hababy&#x27;s Christmas Eve&quot; () a book based on a story told by Klinger about a family of camels who brought the Wise Men to baby Jesus in his manger, with his wife in 2003.

Farr collapsed during a dinner show in Edmonton in 2014 and was transported to the hospital. He finished out the week of shows until an understudy was found, then flew home to California, where he had a stent put into his heart to treat atherosclerosis. In 2018, after collapsing during rehearsals for &quot;Jack of Diamonds&quot;, he decided to retire from stage acting.

==Personal life==
Farr met his wife Joy Ann Richards, a model, shortly after returning from military service. They married in 1963 and have two children, Jonas (c. 1969) and Yvonne (c. 1972). In 2021, Farr told &quot;We Are the Mighty&quot; that James Jabara was his cousin. Farr has battled severe rheumatoid arthritis since the early 1990s.

Farr was very close to Red Skelton, describing him as his &quot;hero&quot; and &quot;mentor&quot;, and like &quot;a second father&quot; to him. He shared that Skelton was one of his favorite comedians growing up. Before Farr left for his military service, Skelton gave him a Saint Christopher medal, which he has worn since. When Skelton died in 1997, his widow asked Farr to be a pallbearer at his funeral.

Public records show that Farr has contributed financially to the Republican National Committee and Republican Party candidates multiple times since 1988, including to the campaigns of Darrell Issa (2022), who grew up in Ohio and is of Lebanese ancestry, and Joe Leibham (2009).

==Legacy and honors==
Farr has remained deeply loyal to his hometown of Toledo, Ohio, and the city has returned the sentiment. In 1977, he was awarded Toledo&#x27;s version of the Keys to the City, a ceremonial glass. Scott High School named their new performing arts wing after him the same year. The University of Toledo awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1983 and, in 1998, a park where Farr spent a lot of his childhood was renamed the Jamie Farr Park, something he has referred to as &quot;a highlight of my life and career.&quot; Tony Packo&#x27;s Cafe, a restaurant referenced several times by Klinger on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, displays a hot dog bun signed by Farr at their establishment. In 2017, Farr and Klinger were the first two inductees to the Toledo Mud Hens&#x27; Celebrity Hall of Fame. In 2023, an artist erected Jumpin&#x27; Jamie, a fiberglass frog statue part of a larger public art piece. The frog is named after Farr and is dressed in a babushka and red lipstick in homage to Klinger. Originally at the Highland Meadows Golf Club, where the Jamie Farr Toledo Classic was held, it is now kept at Bittersweet Farms. There is also an academic scholarship bearing his name through the Greater Toledo Community Foundation.

In 1983, Judd Silverman approached Farr about &quot;lending his name&quot; to a golf tournament. The following year, the Jamie Farr Toledo Classic, an annual LPGA tour stop, held its inaugural event in Sylvania, Ohio. Sponsored by Kroger, Owens Corning, and O-I Glass, the tournament raises money for children&#x27;s charities, including the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Farr hosted the event for 28 years until it was rebranded the Marathon Classic in 2012. As of 2023, it is called the Dana Open.

Outside of Ohio, Farr has been nominated for an Emmy for his time on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, given the Comedy Achievement Honoree award at the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival, and inducted into the Boys and Girls Clubs of America Alumni Hall of Fame. In 1985, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Two of the dresses he wore as Klinger had previously been worn by Ginger Rogers and Betty Grable and are now owned by the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. In 2001, he received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor from the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations and in 2016 was given the Arab American Institute Foundation&#x27;s Special Recognition Award.

<text>Gary Rich Burghoff (born May 24, 1943) is an American actor who is known for originating the role of Charlie Brown in the 1967 Off-Broadway musical &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;, and the character Corporal Walter Eugene &quot;Radar&quot; O&#x27;Reilly in the film &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, as well as the TV series. He was a regular on television game show &quot;Match Game&quot; from 1974 to 1979 for 204 episodes, standing in for Charles Nelson Reilly, who was in New York doing a Broadway play, and continued to make recurring appearances afterwards.

==Early life==
Burghoff was born in Bristol, Connecticut, moved to Clinton, Connecticut, and then later moved to Delavan, Wisconsin.

He studied tap dance and became a drummer, despite being born with brachydactyly caused by Poland syndrome, which made three fingers on his left hand significantly smaller than those on his right hand. He gained early experience acting with the Belfry Players of Williams Bay, Wisconsin. He received his acting training at HB Studio in New York City.

==Career==
In 1967, Burghoff portrayed Charlie Brown in the original off-Broadway production of &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;.

He was the drummer for a band called The Relatives in 1968. Lynda Carter, later a well-known actress, was the band&#x27;s singer. The group opened at the Sahara Hotel and Casino lounge in Las Vegas, Nevada, and played there for three months. He and Carter remained friends, and much later they appeared together in an episode of her hit series &quot;The New Adventures of Wonder Woman&quot; in the 1978 episode &quot;The Man Who Wouldn&#x27;t Tell&quot;.

===&quot;M*A*S*H&quot;===

Burghoff made his feature film debut in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970). Although several actors from the original film made guest appearances in the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, Burghoff was the only actor to continue as a regular, in the role of Radar O&#x27;Reilly. Although he played the same character in the series as in the film, Burghoff has cited differences in the portrayal: In the original feature film M*A*S*H, I created Radar as a lone, darker and somewhat sardonic character; kind of a shadowy figure. I continued these qualities for a short time until I realized that the TV M*A*S*H characters were developing in a different direction from the film characters. It became a group of sophisticated, highly educated doctors (and one head nurse) who would rather be anywhere else and who understood the nature of the &quot;hellhole&quot; they were stuck in. With [Larry] Gelbart&#x27;s help, I began to mold Radar into a more innocent, naïve character as contrast to the other characters, so that while the others might deplore the immorality and shame of war (from an intellectual and judgmental viewpoint), Radar could just REACT from a position of total innocence.

Burghoff was nominated for six Emmy Awards for &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; in the category of Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and, of those nominations, he won an Emmy in 1977. Burghoff&#x27;s co-star Alan Alda accepted the award on his behalf.

Burghoff left &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; in 1979 after the seventh season because of burnout and a desire to spend more time with his family, though he returned the following season to film a special two-part farewell episode, &quot;Goodbye Radar&quot;. He explained, &quot;Family, to me, became the most important thing. I was not available as a father because of my work. That doesn&#x27;t stop when the work stops. Whenever you go out as a family, you&#x27;re always torn from family to deal with public recognition.&quot; &quot;Goodbye Radar&quot; was supposed to be the final episode of season 7, but at the behest of CBS, it was extended into a double-episode for the November sweeps the next season. Fellow cast member Mike Farrell tried to persuade Burghoff to stay on the show, citing the lackluster careers of former &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; regulars Larry Linville and McLean Stevenson after their departures.

Farrell later said, &quot;Gary Burghoff may well have been the best actor in the company, it&#x27;s always seemed to me. His focus, his ability to find those little gems of behavior that made everything absolutely true were a marvel to behold.&quot;

===Later career===
Burghoff appeared regularly on TV, making appearances on such game shows as &quot;Match Game&quot;, &quot;Tattletales&quot;, &quot;Liar&#x27;s Club&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, and &quot;Showoffs&quot;. He also appeared in the film &quot;B.S. I Love You&quot;, as well as one episode each of &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and &quot;Ellery Queen&quot;. His &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; character, Radar O&#x27;Reilly, appeared on two episodes in the first season of &quot;AfterMASH&quot;. It was then spun off into &quot;W*A*L*T*E*R,&quot; which aired only once in the Eastern and Central time zones.

In the 1980s, Burghoff was the TV spokesman for BP gasoline and IBM computers. In 2000, Burghoff was a spokesman for dot-com era auction aggregation site PriceRadar.com.

Burghoff is a self-taught amateur wildlife painter who also is qualified to handle injured wildlife in California.

He worked as a professional jazz drummer, heading the trio The We Three. In the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; episode &quot;Showtime&quot;, Radar is seen playing a solo on the drums; he was actually performing, and the music was not overdubbed. He can also be seen playing drums in the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; episode &quot;Bulletin Board&quot; in the picnic scene and the episode &quot;Dear Dad...Again&quot; in the no-talent show scene.

Burghoff is the inventor (, ) of &quot;Chum Magic&quot;, a fishing tackle invention that attracts fish toward the user&#x27;s boat. Other Burghoff inventions include a toilet seat lifting handle () and a new type of fishing pole.

Burghoff is a philatelist. He was asked in 1993 to help select a postal stamp for United States hunters.

Burghoff came out of retirement in 2010 to star in the film &quot;Daniel&#x27;s Lot&quot;.

==Personal life==
Burghoff was married to Janet Gayle from 1971 to 1979. They have one daughter.

In 1985, he married Elisabeth Bostrom. The couple have two sons; they divorced in 2005.

<text>The Roseanne Show is an American first-run syndicated talk show that was hosted by Roseanne Barr. The show ran for two seasons from September 14, 1998, to June 23, 2000, in which it broadcast 281 episodes. 

==Format==
The show featured Barr interviewing guests. During some episodes there were live call-ins or web chats from viewers and celebrities. The set of the show consisted of a living room, a kitchen, and a garden scene. The set rotated to present a different interview setting. The show also featured skits with audience member participation. Skits included &quot;Judge Roseanne&quot;, &quot;The Dr. Is In-sane&quot; and a dating game-esque skit. Some skits also included her producer Mary Pelloni. Throughout the show&#x27;s entire two-year run, Dailey Pike was Roseanne&#x27;s warmup guy and sidekick regular on the show. In season one, Zach Hope was Roseanne&#x27;s cyber sidekick. Later in season two, Michael Fishman, who portrayed D.J. Conner on &quot;Roseanne&quot;, replaced Hope as Roseanne&#x27;s cyber sidekick.

Notable people who performed on &quot;The Roseanne Show&quot; were Enrique Iglesias, Sheryl Crow, Mick Foley, Janice Robinson, Lulu, LFO, Joan Jett, Pat Benatar, Anna Nicole Smith, and Tori Amos.

<doc id="89695" wikidata="Q429391" url="?curid=89695" title="William Christopher">
<text>William Christopher (October 20, 1932 December 31, 2016) was an American actor and comedian, best known for playing Private Lester Hummel on &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; from 1965 to 1968 and Father Francis John Patrick Mulcahy on the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; from 1972 to 1983 and its spinoff &quot;AfterMASH&quot; from 1983 to 1985.

==Early life==
Christopher was born in Evanston, Illinois, in a family believed to be descendants of Paul Revere. He spent his youth in several of Chicago&#x27;s northern suburbs, including Winnetka, Illinois, where he attended New Trier High School. Christopher graduated from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, with a Bachelor of Arts in drama, focusing on Greek literature. While at university, he participated in fencing, soccer, and the glee club, and was initiated as a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.

==Career==
Christopher moved to New York and appeared in a variety of regional productions and later a number of off-Broadway productions such as &quot;The Hostage&quot; at One Sheridan Square. His Broadway debut came in &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;, a British revue, acting alongside Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.

Christopher left New York City for Hollywood to attempt to gain work in television where he guest-starred in several well-known series, including &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot; and &quot;The Men from Shiloh&quot;. He made several appearances (each time as a different character) on &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, and had recurring roles on &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; and &quot;That Girl&quot;. Christopher was a student at Harvey Lembeck’s famed L.A. improvisational workshop in the early 1970s during which time he performed improv skits (with two other performers, Carole White and Shelia Bartold, both also Lembeck students) during a January 1972 episode of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;. While the appearance was officially uncredited, he was introduced by Burnett as Bill Christopher.

In 1972, Christopher gained the role of Father Mulcahy in the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; when the actor who was first cast in the role, George Morgan, was replaced after a single appearance in the pilot episode. Immediately following &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, Christopher continued the role for the two seasons of the short-lived spin-off &quot;AfterMASH&quot;.

In feature films, Christopher performed in &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot;, &quot;The Private Navy of Sgt. O&#x27;Farrell&quot;, &quot;The Shakiest Gun in the West&quot;, &quot;With Six You Get Eggroll&quot;, and &quot;Hearts of the West&quot;. He had parts in telefilms including &quot;The Movie Maker&quot;, &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot;, and &quot;For the Love of It&quot;. The comedy film &quot;With Six You Get Eggroll&quot; is notable for fans of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; because Jamie Farr and Christopher appear in it together, both playing hippies, five years before they co-starred in the series.

After gaining attention for &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, Christopher appeared in various other television series, including &quot;Good Times&quot; (as the military doctor examining J.J. Evans) and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, and made multiple guest appearances on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. In 1998, he guest-starred as a priest in an episode of &quot;Mad About You&quot;. He also remained active in the theater, including a tour of the United States in the mid-1990s with Farr, performing Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; on stage. In 2008–2009, he toured with &quot;Church Basement Ladies&quot;. One of Christopher&#x27;s last roles was that of a priest (Father Tobias) on the daytime drama &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.

==Charity work==
Christopher, whose son Ned has autism, devoted much of his spare time to the National Autistic Society, doing public-service announcements to bring attention to autism. In 1985, his wife Barbara and he wrote &quot;Mixed Blessings&quot;, a book about their experiences in raising Ned.

==Personal life==
Christopher met his future wife Barbara on a blind date. They married in 1957 and the couple adopted two sons. The two appeared together in the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; season 4 episode &quot;Dear Mildred&quot;, where they sang the song &quot;All Dressed Up and No Place to Go&quot; in a duet.

==Death==
Christopher died at his home in Pasadena, California, on December 31, 2016. According to his son John Christopher, the 84-year-old actor died as the result of non-small-cell carcinoma (lung cancer). He had been diagnosed with cancer about 18 months earlier, according to his New York-based agent Robert Malcolm. He died exactly one year after fellow &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; cast member Wayne Rogers.

<text>William Wayne McMillan Rogers III (April 7, 1933 – December 31, 2015) was an American actor, known for playing the role of Captain &quot;Trapper&quot; John McIntyre in the CBS television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and as Dr. Charley Michaels on &quot;House Calls&quot; (1979–1982).

He was a regular panel member on the Fox News Channel stock investment television program &quot;Cashin&#x27; In&quot; as a result of having built a career as an investor, investment strategist, adviser, and money manager. Rogers also studied acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City.

==Early life==
Born in Birmingham, Alabama, Rogers attended Ramsay High School in Birmingham and was a graduate of the Webb School in Bell Buckle, Tennessee. He earned a history degree from Princeton University in 1954. He was a member of the Princeton Triangle Club and the eating club Tiger Inn. After college, Rogers served as an officer in the United States Navy, as a navigator on the USS &quot;Denebola&quot;, and planned to enter Harvard Law School before he became an actor.

==Career==
===Early career===
Rogers appeared on television in both dramas and sitcoms such as &quot;The Invaders,&quot; &quot;The F.B.I.,&quot; &quot;Combat!,&quot; &quot;Gunsmoke,&quot; &quot;Have Gun Will Travel,&quot; &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive,&quot; &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.,&quot; and &quot;The Fugitive,&quot; and had a small supporting role in the 1967 movie &quot;Cool Hand Luke.&quot; He also appeared on &quot;The Big Valley&quot; in 1968.

He played Slim Davis on the soap opera &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; in 1959. He also played a role in &quot;Odds Against Tomorrow,&quot; which was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 1960 as Best Film Promoting International Understanding. He guest starred on an episode of the CBS western &quot;Johnny Ringo.&quot;

Rogers co-starred with Robert Bray and Richard Eyer in the western series &quot;Stagecoach West&quot; on ABC from 1960 to 1961.

Rogers was cast as U.S. Army Lieutenant Richard Henry Pratt in 1965 in &quot;Death Valley Days.&quot;

He appeared on the &quot;Cannon&quot; episode &quot;Call Unicorn&quot; in 1971.

=== &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1972–1975) ===
When Rogers was approached for &quot;M*A*S*H,&quot; he planned to audition for the role of Hawkeye Pierce. He found the character too cynical, however, and asked to screen test as Trapper John, whose outlook was brighter. Rogers was told that Trapper and Hawkeye would have equal importance as characters. That changed after Alan Alda, whose acting career and résumé up to that point had outshone that of Rogers, was cast as Hawkeye and proved to be more popular with the audience. Rogers enjoyed working with Alda and the rest of the cast as a whole (Alda and Rogers quickly became close friends), but eventually chafed that the writers were devoting the show&#x27;s best humorous and dramatic moments to Alda. 

When the writers took the liberty of making Hawkeye a thoracic surgeon in the episode &quot;Dear Dad&quot; (December 17, 1972), even though Trapper was the unit&#x27;s only thoracic surgeon in the movie and the novel, Rogers felt Trapper had been stripped of his credentials. He decided to leave the show between production of the third and fourth seasons, making his last on-screen appearance in the episode Abyssinia, Henry, which was also the final episode for fellow cast member McLean Stevenson who had portrayed Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake. 

On the &quot;M*A*S*H 30th Anniversary Reunion Television Special&quot; aired by Fox-TV in 2002, Rogers spoke on the differences between the Hawkeye and Trapper characters, saying, &quot;Alan [Alda] and I both used to discuss ways on how to distinguish the differences between the two characters as to where there would be a variance... My character [Trapper John McIntyre] was a little more impulsive [than Hawkeye].&quot; Rogers considerably reduced his Alabama accent for the character of Trapper.

He succeeded Elliott Gould, who had played the character in the Robert Altman movie &quot;MASH&quot;, and was himself succeeded by Pernell Roberts on the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; spin-off &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot; After three seasons, Rogers left the show after a contract dispute with the producers.

===Post-&quot;M*A*S*H&quot; work ===
After leaving &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, Rogers appeared as an FBI agent in the 1975 NBC-TV movie &quot;Attack on Terror: The FBI vs. the Ku Klux Klan,&quot; as Michael Stone in the 1980 miniseries &quot;Top of the Hill&quot;, and as civil rights attorney Morris Dees in 1996&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts of Mississippi.&quot; He also starred in the short-lived 1976 period detective series &quot;City of Angels&quot; and the 1979–1982 CBS series &quot;House Calls,&quot; first with Lynn Redgrave (both were nominated for Golden Globes in 1981, as best actor and best actress in TV comedy, but did not win) and then later with actress Sharon Gless. Rogers also appeared in the 1980s miniseries &quot;Chiefs&quot;.

Rogers then was a guest star five times in a recurring role on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Murder, She Wrote.&quot; He has served as an executive producer and producer in both television and film, and as a screenwriter, and a director.

Rogers also starred in several other movies. In 1981, he played the role of an art forger in Roger Vadim&#x27;s &quot;The Hot Touch.&quot; Then, in the movie &quot;The Gig&quot; (1985), alongside Cleavon Little, he was a jazz musician-hobbyist whose group has an opportunity to play a Catskills resort and must confront failure. Also in 1985, he starred opposite Barbara Eden in the televised reunion movie &quot;I Dream of Jeannie... Fifteen Years Later&quot; based on the 1960s situation comedy &quot;I Dream of Jeannie.&quot; Rogers took on the role of Major Tony Nelson, which was originally portrayed by Larry Hagman in the television series when Hagman was unavailable to reprise the character he had originated. In 1986, Rogers hosted the short-lived CBS television series &quot;High Risk&quot;. He also starred as Walter Duncan in the 1987 movie &quot;Race Against the Harvest.&quot;
In 1990, Rogers co-starred with Connie Selleca in the CBS made-for-television movie &quot;Miracle Landing&quot; based on the true story of the 1988 Aloha Airlines Flight 243 crash landing after an explosive cabin depressurization.

===Financial career===
Rogers began to test the stock and real estate markets during his tenure as a &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; cast member and became a successful money manager and investor. In 1988 and 1990, he appeared before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary as an expert witness, testifying in favor of retaining the banking laws enacted under the Glass–Steagall Legislation act of 1933. He appeared regularly as a panel member on the Fox Business Network cable TV stocks investment/stocks news program &quot;Cashin&#x27; In,&quot; hosted since 2013 by Fox News anchor Eric Bolling. In August 2006, Rogers was elected to the board of directors of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc., a Fortune 1000 manufacturer of semiconductors and electronic components. He was also the head of Wayne Rogers &amp; Co., a stock trading investment corporation.

On April 23, 2012, Rogers signed as the new spokesman for Senior Home Loans, a direct reverse mortgage lender headquartered in Long Island, New York.

=== Awards ===
Rogers received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2005.

==Personal life and death==
As a young actor, Rogers met actress Mitzi McWhorter in New York in the late 1950s. They married in 1960, had two children, and divorced in 1983. They had been separated for almost four years prior to the divorce. Rogers married his second wife, Amy Hirsh, in 1988. 

In 2001, Rogers and his wife moved to Destin, Florida.

Rogers died on December 31, 2015, from complications of pneumonia in Los Angeles at the age of 82. He died exactly one year before fellow &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; cast member William Christopher.

<doc id="89698" wikidata="Q3235404" url="?curid=89698" title="Ricki Lake (1993 talk show)">
<text>Ricki Lake is an American first-run syndicated talk show that was hosted by Ricki Lake. The show ran for eleven seasons from September 13, 1993, to May 21, 2004, in which it broadcast 2,420 episodes. Taped at Chelsea Studios, the show was primarily formatted as a tabloid talk show. It featured single-issue panel discussions with everyday people, in which the guests discussed their personal experiences. These topics were often centered on relational transgressions. Lake moderated these discussions and an emphasis was placed on audience engagement.

==Format==
The show specialized in sensationalist topics involving invited guests and incorporated questions and comments from a studio audience. But unlike most of the counterparts of the day, her primary audience was aimed at teenagers, young adults, college students, and urban viewers (who described themselves as &quot;Generation X&quot;) rather than the 25+ audience that advertisers were catering to, plus it was less sensational and tamer compared to the other programs. It was taped at the Chelsea Studios in New York City. During an interview on &quot;A Spoonful of Paolo&quot;, Lake stated that she almost signed up to do the show for only $5,000.

A majority of the shows had surprises waiting in store for the guests, which were revealed by a doorbell ringing if a guest didn&#x27;t come clean about themselves. This prompted Ricki to bring out another guest who knew the truth about the primary guest&#x27;s intentions. At times, the guests would find out that someone else had been listening to their confession while they were on stage or in the audience. On one show in 1997 for example, a guy who admitted to having an affair was unaware that his wife was on stage. The doorbell (and other surprises) were a major part of the series throughout its run.

==Production==
===Conception and development===
In 1992, television producers Garth Ancier and Gail Steinberg conceived the idea of a talk show that targeted young adults. It materialized as &quot;Jane&quot;, a show hosted by &quot;Sassy&quot; editor Jane Pratt that focused on young and explicit topics. It received a 13-week trial run on WNYW; however, it was not renewed or picked up for syndication. Ancier claimed that &quot;Jane&quot;″s production company, 20th Century Fox, liked the show&#x27;s format although not Pratt as host. As a result, Ancier searched for a new host for the show. Over 100 women auditioned for the role and the finalists included Veronica Webb, Melissa Rivers, and Ricki Lake. According to Steinberg, producers wanted &quot;someone who&#x27;s young but someone who has enough of a world view to bring some understanding to a range of topics. When we met Ricki, we felt all of that immediately.&quot; Most of &quot;Jane&quot;″s production staff was retained for Lake&#x27;s show, which Ancier described as &quot;Jane&quot; with a new host.

===Topic selection===
The show&#x27;s premiere featured the topic &quot;I&#x27;m Getting Married But I Haven&#x27;t Met My Husband Yet&quot;.

During the series&#x27; run, its primary focus was on dealing with personal subjects like parenting skills (including single mothers who are accused of having the lack of experience of taking care of children), romantic relationships (both marital and non-marital), LGBT issues (like discrimination, same-sex couples who want to have children or straight people attracted to a person who is LGBT or the other way around), racism and prejudice (even within their own race and gender), interracial relationships, family discord, revealing secrets, and social topics of the day (like money, looking for work or being on welfare). At times she had lighter shows, ranging from contests (including female impersonators, beauticians, or those who want to prove to others that they do have talent), celebrity guests, and reunions, to granting viewers&#x27; personal wishes.

Lake&#x27;s talk show sometimes covered serious topics, including domestic violence (&quot;Bad Men, Desperate Woman&quot;), homeless people who live in the NYC subway system (&quot;The Catacomb People&quot;) and &quot;Teens on Death Row&quot;. Lake also took on shows that dealt with women who were members of the Ku Klux Klan, and during a show involving marijuana, she learned that three guests were using the substance just moments before they walked on to the set to be interviewed by her.

One of Lake&#x27;s most memorable and controversial confrontations happened during the first season, when she found herself dealing with Reverend Fred Phelps in a show that involved targeting anyone who carries the AIDS virus and why they deserve to die. (Phelps and his followers from Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas had been picketing at funerals for AIDS victims across the United States, leading to several states to enact laws prohibiting or restricting groups from coming within a certain distance of the funerals.) When Phelps and his son-in-law tried to take over the set, a furious and insulted Lake ordered the Phelps family to leave the studio. During the commercial break, the two were forced off the set by the producers and escorted out of the building by security. After Phelps died on March 19, 2014, Lake tweeted on her Twitter page that when he was on the show he told her that she worshipped her rectum on camera, which led to Lake taking action off-stage to force Phelps off the show after that remark. The series also experienced controversy after an episode titled &quot;I&#x27;m Angry Because People Think I&#x27;m Gay&quot; was taped, in which the audience became &quot;increasingly hostile&quot; and made many &quot;inappropriate remarks.&quot; The media monitoring organization GLAAD attempted to prevent the episode from airing.

===Guest and audience recruitment===
The methodology for securing guests on the show, common to many shows similar to it, was as such: Producers would brainstorm and come up with a show title or theme. During an aired episode of the program spots would run for shows in pre-production. The goal was to recruit persons who may have a situation in their life that fits with the proposed topic. Hotline messages would be screened and the most promising prospects would be contacted by a production assistant. The potential guest would be interviewed about their situation. Guests chosen to appear on the show were booked airfare to New York City, brought to the television studio and sent to specific &quot;green rooms&quot;, inside which they were briefed in more detail on how the show would be taped. One of the producers then sat down with each guest to reiterate the story, including emphasis on various phrases or statements the guest might have made during pre-interviews. Guests were given an appearance and confidentiality contract to sign and installments were recorded in real-time, which took approximately 80 minutes to complete. Lake came into the audience for taped segments and, during the paused portion (where commercial breaks were inserted), she left the audience to consult with producers. The final show was aired approximately one month later. However, if the guest (or guests) lied to the producers prior to coming on air, they were forced off the set and their travel arrangements cancelled. This happened twice during the show&#x27;s run, and both events aired.

==Broadcast history and release==
The show was also popular in other countries, especially in the United Kingdom, where it aired on Channel 4, and was aired daily on ITV2, until 2009, as well as in Australia, where the show was screened on three channels: the Seven (1997–2002), Ten (1994–1997) and pay TV-exclusive W Channel (2002–2004). The show was also successful in the Netherlands, where it aired on SBS6. Even though it has been out of production since 2004, the show is still screened in various places around the world such as Nigeria and in the Middle East.

Garth Ancier and Gail Steinberg were the original executive producers. Michael Rourke moved into the executive producer role in 2002, during the 9th season, with Michelle Mazur, a former producer in the 1990s of the show, moved into the role of co-executive producer at the start of the 10th season. The theme was written by John Benitez. The show was produced by The Garth Ancier Company and was distributed by Columbia Pictures Television Distribution (1993–1995), then by Columbia TriStar Television Distribution (1995–2001), Columbia TriStar Domestic Television (2001–2002), and Sony Pictures Television (2002–2004). In the UK the series first appeared on Saturday October 1, 1994, on Channel 4 and continued until 2001.

==Reception==
Awards the show has garnered include the Gracie Allen Award, PRISM Certificates &amp; Commendations, and many more.

===Critical response===
&quot;New York&quot; listed it as one of the worst television shows of 1995.

===Cultural impact===
It has been referenced in popular music, such as in the Offspring&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)&quot; and the Femme Fatale remix of Britney Spears&#x27;s &quot;Till the World Ends&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
==Aftermath==
In 2000, Ricki Lake told her audience on &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot; that her contract was up for renewal in 2004. In September 2003, rumors began swirling about the show&#x27;s demise as Lake was in serious talks to be cast in a 30-minute sitcom for CBS. On January 21, 2004, The Futon Critic reported that &quot;the show&#x27;s future remains up in the air&quot; due to the sitcom, and because Lake herself was not in attendance at the convention. In February 2004, the show was officially cancelled. Witnessing 9/11 from the rooftop of her New York City apartment, Lake has stated in several interviews that at that point she knew &quot;I am getting out of my marriage, I am getting out of this show&quot;. On June 27, 2019, Ricki told Rupaul that two days after the attacks, she had to go back and do topics that, although still loving her show, didn&#x27;t reflect what she wanted her legacy to be. Surprisingly, Sony Pictures didn&#x27;t provide any comments when the show was cancelled, despite a large profit the show brought.

On October 9, 2005, &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Cable&quot; magazine reported that Lake might return to do a new version of her show. A source said it would be a surprise if there was no deal struck by October 2005. If it were to have happened, it would have likely debuted in September 2006. Lake did not appear at the 2006 NATPE convention to pitch the proposed program to television stations in the United States in January, 2006, only furthering speculation that there would be no show. In a 2009 interview on CNN, she was asked about what was next for her. Lake noted that a follow-up documentary was coming out, and that she was in talks to do another talk show, but this has yet to come to pass. In follow-up interviews since then such as Oprah in 2010, Lake has consistently said &quot;never say never&quot; about hosting a new show, but that she is happy working on other projects. However, in a February 2011 appearance on &quot;The View&quot;, when asked about doing another show, Ricki said that she &quot;misses the platform&quot; and that when it comes to hosting another show, &quot;that&#x27;s certainly a possibility.&quot;

In March 2011 it was reported that three television studios, Disney–ABC Domestic Television, Universal Media Studios and CBS Television Distribution, were interested in bringing Lake back to talk television in 2012. This after Lake began appearing on various programs in which she expressed a desire to return to the genre. On April 20, 2011, Lake signed with 20th Television to develop a subsequent talk show for a September 2012 launch. It is described as having more of an &quot;Oprah&quot;-like format than her previous series.

<text>Yahoo! Internet Life was a monthly magazine published by Ziff Davis, which licensed the name from Yahoo!, the well-known web portal and search engine website. It was created and launched by G. Barry Golson, the former executive editor of &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;TV Guide&quot;. The magazine was published 1996–2002, and focused on the emerging Internet and computer culture of the late 1990s and early 2000s.

==History==
The forerunner of &quot;Yahoo! Internet Life&quot; was started in 1995, when Ziff Davis invested in Yahoo! and subsequently published just one issue of &quot;ZD Internet Life&quot; (Vol.1 No.1 Fall 1995). In 1996, along with other publications, Dan Rosensweig led the relaunch of the magazine as &quot;Yahoo! Internet Life&quot;(first issue was Vol 2. No.1 Spring 1996)– which had been retooled by Golson –before being appointed Yahoo! COO, in 2002, with Golson serving as editor-in-chief until the magazine&#x27;s demise in 2002. The magazine featured regular columns by film critic Roger Ebert, and others, and published many reviews of a variety of webpages and tech gadgets. &quot;Yahoo! Internet Life&quot; explored potentially controversial tech-related issues such as pornography and peer-to-peer technology.

==Alumni==
Alanis Morissette appeared (apparently topless, with strategically crossed hands) on the cover of its August 2000 &quot;Music Blowout&quot; issue. Its closure was announced in July 2002, and its last issue was published that August.

In addition to editor-in-chief Golson, other editors included Angela Gunn, Lisa Holzer, Stevan Keane, Ben Greenman, Larry Smith, David Thomas, Ron Bel Bruno, Bilge Ebiri, and Rob Bernstein. The design director was Gail Ghezzi.

<text>William Manuel &quot;Bill&quot; Johnson (died December 3, 1972) was an American jazz musician who played banjo and double bass; he is considered the father of the &quot;slap&quot; style of double bass playing.

In New Orleans, he played at Lulu White&#x27;s legendary house of prostitution, with the Eagle Band, and with the Excelsior Brass Band. Johnson claimed to have started &quot;slapping&quot; the strings of his bass (a more vigorous technique than the classical pizzicato) after he accidentally broke his bow on the road with his band in northern Louisiana in the early 1910s. Other New Orleans string bass players picked up this style, and spread it across the country with the spread of New Orleans Jazz.

Johnson was founder and manager of the first jazz band to leave New Orleans and tour widely in the 1910s, The Original Creole Orchestra. They participated in vaudeville skits centered around the &quot;Uncle&quot; character and the &quot;boys,&quot; performing in the Midwest, Northwest, and Canada. He brought the Creole Band to Chicago in 1915. Johnson and his band played an instrumental role in establishing Royal Gardens (later known as Lincoln Gardens), as one of the great jazz clubs in Chicago; a location they were residence at beginning in 1918.

In Chicago during the early 1920s he assembled King Oliver&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band, considered perhaps the best of the early ensemble style jazz bands. He taught younger Chicago musicians (including Milt Hinton) his &quot;slap&quot; style of string bass playing. He made many recordings in Chicago in the late 1920s. He notably says &quot;Oh play that thing&quot; into the horn during the recording of &quot;Dippermouth Blues&quot; in 1923 with King Oliver&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band.

Johnson continued to play with various jazz bands and orchestras into the early 1950s, sometimes working under other names. He was also involved in the import/export business along the Mexico–United States border.

Johnson&#x27;s younger half-brother Ollie &quot;Dink&quot; Johnson was also a noted musician. Jelly Roll Morton&#x27;s common law wife from 1917 to 1922, Anita Gonzales (Bessie Johnson), was Bill Johnson&#x27;s half-sister.

Bill Johnson died in New Braunfels, Texas in 1972.

<text>Blackface is the practice of performers using burned cork, shoe polish, or theatrical makeup to portray a caricature of black people on stage or in entertainment. Scholarship on the origins or definition of blackface vary with some taking a global perspective that includes European culture and Western colonialism. Blackface became a global phenomenon as an outgrowth of theatrical practices of racial impersonation popular throughout Britain and its colonial empire, where it was integral to the development of imperial racial politics. Scholars with this wider view may date the practice of blackface to as early as Medieval Europe&#x27;s mystery plays when bitumen and coal were used to darken the skin of white performers portraying demons, devils, and damned souls. Still others date the practice to English Renaissance theater, in works such as William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;.

However, some scholars see blackface as a specific practice limited to American culture that began in the minstrel show; a performance art that originated in the United States in the early 19th century and which contained its own performance practices unique to the American stage. Scholars taking this point of view see blackface as arising not from a European stage tradition but from the context of class warfare from within the United States, with the American white working poor inventing blackface as a means of expressing their anger over being disenfranchised economically, politically, and socially from middle and upper class White America. 

In the United States, the practice of blackface became a popular entertainment during the 19th century into the 20th. It contributed to the spread of racial stereotypes such as &quot;Jim Crow&quot;, the &quot;happy-go-lucky darky on the plantation&quot;, and &quot;Zip Coon&quot; also known as the &quot;dandified coon&quot;. 

By the middle of the 19th century, blackface minstrel shows had become a distinctive American artform, translating formal works such as opera into popular terms for a general audience. Although minstrelsy began with white performers, by the 1840s there were also many all-black cast minstrel shows touring the United States in blackface, as well as black entertainers performing in shows with predominately white casts in blackface. Some of the most successful and prominent minstrel show performers, composers and playwrights were themselves black, such as: Bert Williams, Bob Cole, and J. Rosamond Johnson. 

Early in the 20th century, blackface branched off from the minstrel show and became a form of entertainment in its own right, including Tom Shows, parodying abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s 1852 novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. In the United States, blackface declined in popularity from the 1940s, with performances dotting the cultural landscape into the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. It was generally considered highly offensive, disrespectful, and racist by the late 20th century, but the practice (or similar-looking ones) was exported to other countries.

== Early history ==

There is no consensus about a single moment that constitutes the origin of blackface. Arizona State University professor Ayanna Thompson links the beginning of blackface to stage practices within the Medieval Europe miracle or mystery plays. It was common practice in medieval Europe to use bitumen and soot from coal to darken skin to depict corrupted souls, demons, and devils in blackface. Louisiana State University professor Anthony Barthelemy stated, &quot;“In many medieval miracle plays, the souls of the damned were represented by actors painted black or in black costumes... In [many versions], Lucifer and his confederate rebels, after having sinned, turn black.” 

The journalist and cultural commentator John Strausbaugh places it as part of a tradition of &quot;displaying Blackness for the enjoyment and edification of white viewers&quot; that dates back at least to 1441, when captive West Africans were displayed in Portugal. White people routinely portrayed the black characters in the Elizabethan and Jacobean theater (see English Renaissance theatre), most famously in &quot;Othello&quot; (1604). However, &quot;Othello&quot; and other plays of this era did not involve the emulation and caricature of &quot;such supposed innate qualities of Blackness as inherent musicality, natural athleticism&quot;, etc. that Strausbaugh sees as crucial to blackface.

A 2023 article appearing on the National Museum of African American History and Culture website, asserts that the birth of blackface is attributable to class warfare: Historian Dale Cockrell once noted that poor and working-class whites who felt “squeezed politically, economically, and socially from the top, but also from the bottom, invented minstrelsy” as a way of expressing the oppression that marked being members of the majority, but outside of the white norm.By objectifying formerly enslaved people through demeaning, humor-inducing stock caricatures, &quot;comedic performances of &#x27;blackness&#x27; by whites in exaggerated costumes and make-up, [could not] be separated fully from the racial derision and stereotyping at its core&quot;. This process of &quot;thingification&quot; has been written about by Nigerian author Chinua Achebe, &quot;The whole idea of a stereotype is to simplify&quot;, and by Aimé Césaire, &quot;Césaire revealed over and over again the colonizers’ sense of superiority and their sense of mission as the world’s civilizers, a mission that depended on turning the Other into barbarians&quot;.

== History within the United States ==

Blackface was a performance tradition in the American theater for roughly 100 years beginning around 1830. It was practiced in Britain as well, surviving longer than in the U.S.; &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot; on television lasted until 1978.

In both the United States and Britain, blackface was most commonly used in the minstrel performance tradition, which it both predated and outlasted. Early white performers in blackface used burnt cork and later greasepaint or shoe polish to blacken their skin and exaggerate their lips, often wearing woolly wigs, gloves, tailcoats, or ragged clothes to complete the transformation. According to a 1901 source: &quot;Be careful to get the black even around the eyes and mouth. Leave the lips just as they are, they will appear red to the audience. Comedians leave a wide white space all around the lips. It makes the mouth appear larger and will look red as the lips do. If you wish to represent an old darkey, use white drop chalk, outlining the eyebrows, chin, whisk- ers or a gray beard.&quot; Later, black artists also performed in blackface. The famous &quot;Dreadnought&quot; hoax involved the use of blackface and costume for a group of high-profile authors to gain access to a military vessel.

Stereotypes embodied in the stock characters of blackface minstrels not only played a significant role in cementing and proliferating racist images, attitudes, and perceptions worldwide, but also in popularizing black culture. In some quarters, the caricatures that were the legacy of blackface persist to the present day and are a cause of ongoing controversy. Another view is that &quot;blackface is a form of cross-dressing in which one puts on the insignias of a sex, class, or race that stands in opposition to one&#x27;s own&quot;.

By the mid-20th century, changing attitudes about race and racism effectively ended the prominence of blackface makeup used in performance in the U.S. and elsewhere. Blackface in contemporary art remains in relatively limited use as a theatrical device; today, it is more commonly used as social commentary or satire. Perhaps the most enduring effect of blackface is the precedent it established in the introduction of African-American culture to an international audience, albeit through a distorted lens. Blackface&#x27;s appropriation, exploitation, and assimilation of African-American culture – as well as the inter-ethnic artistic collaborations that stemmed from it – were but a prologue to the lucrative packaging, marketing, and dissemination of African-American cultural expression and its myriad derivative forms in today&#x27;s world popular culture.

=== 19th century ===

Lewis Hallam, Jr., a white blackface actor of American Company fame, brought blackface in this more specific sense to prominence as a theatrical device in the United States when playing the role of &quot;Mungo&quot;, an inebriated black man in &quot;The Padlock&quot;, a British play that premiered in New York City at the John Street Theatre on May 29, 1769. The play attracted notice, and other performers adopted the style. From at least the 1810s, blackface clowns were popular in the United States. British actor Charles Mathews toured the U.S. in 1822–23, and as a result added a &quot;black&quot; characterization to his repertoire of British regional types for his next show, &quot;A Trip to America&quot;, which included Mathews singing &quot;Possum up a Gum Tree&quot;, a popular slave freedom song. Edwin Forrest played a plantation black in 1823, and George Washington Dixon was already building his stage career around blackface in 1828, but it was another white comic actor, Thomas D. Rice, who truly popularized blackface. Rice introduced the song &quot;Jump Jim Crow&quot;, accompanied by a dance, in his stage act in 1828, and scored stardom with it by 1832.

Rice traveled the U.S., performing under the stage name &quot;Daddy Jim Crow&quot;. The name &quot;Jim Crow&quot; later became attached to statutes that codified the reinstitution of segregation and discrimination after Reconstruction.

In the 1830s and early 1840s, blackface performances mixed skits with comic songs and vigorous dances. Initially, Rice and his peers performed only in relatively disreputable venues, but as blackface gained popularity they gained opportunities to perform as &quot;entr&#x27;actes&quot; in theatrical venues of a higher class. Stereotyped blackface characters developed: buffoonish, lazy, superstitious, cowardly, and lascivious characters, who stole, lied pathologically, and mangled the English language. Early blackface minstrels were all male, so cross-dressing white men also played black women who were often portrayed as unappealingly and grotesquely mannish, in the matronly mammy mold, or as highly sexually provocative. The 1830s American stage, where blackface first rose to prominence, featured similarly comic stereotypes of the clever Yankee and the larger-than-life Frontiersman; the late 19th- and early 20th-century American and British stage where it last prospered featured many other, mostly ethnically-based, comic stereotypes: conniving Jews; drunken brawling Irishmen with ; oily Italians; stodgy Germans; and gullible rural people.

1830s and early 1840s blackface performers performed solo or as duos, with the occasional trio; the traveling troupes that would later characterize blackface minstrelsy arose only with the minstrel show. In New York City in 1843, Dan Emmett and his Virginia Minstrels broke blackface minstrelsy loose from its novelty act and &quot;entr&#x27;acte&quot; status and performed the first full-blown minstrel show: an evening&#x27;s entertainment composed entirely of blackface performance. (E. P. Christy did more or less the same, apparently independently, earlier the same year in Buffalo, New York.) Their loosely structured show with the musicians sitting in a semicircle, a tambourine player on one end and a bones player on the other, set the precedent for what would soon become the first act of a standard three-act minstrel show. By 1852, the skits that had been part of blackface performance for decades expanded to one-act farces, often used as the show&#x27;s third act.
In the 1870s the actress Carrie Swain began performing in minstrel shows alongside her husband, the acrobat and blackface performer Sam Swain. It is possible that she was the first woman performer to appear in blackface. Theatre scholar Shirley Staples stated, &quot;Carrie Swain may have been the first woman to attempt the acrobatic comedy typical of male blackface work.&quot; She later portrayed the blackface role of Topsy in a musical adaptation of Harriet Beecher Stowe anti-slavery novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; by composer Caryl Florio and dramatist H. Wayne Ellis. It premiered at the Chestnut Street Opera House in Philadelphia on May 22, 1882.

The songs of Northern composer Stephen Foster figured prominently in blackface minstrel shows of the period. Though written in dialect and politically incorrect by modern standards, his later songs were free of the ridicule and blatantly racist caricatures that typified other songs of the genre. Foster&#x27;s works treated slaves and the South in general with sentimentality that appealed to audiences of the day.

White minstrel shows featured white performers pretending to be black people, playing their versions of &#x27;black music&#x27; and speaking ersatz black dialects. Minstrel shows dominated popular show business in the U.S. from that time through into the 1890s, also enjoying massive popularity in the UK and in other parts of Europe. As the minstrel show went into decline, blackface returned to its novelty act roots and became part of vaudeville. Blackface featured prominently in film at least into the 1930s, and the &quot;aural blackface&quot; of the &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; radio show lasted into the 1950s. Meanwhile, amateur blackface minstrel shows continued to be common at least into the 1950s. In the UK, one such blackface popular in the 1950s was Ricardo Warley from Alston, Cumbria who toured around the North of England with a monkey called Bilbo.

As a result, the genre played an important role in shaping perceptions of and prejudices about black people generally and African Americans in particular. Some social commentators have stated that blackface provided an outlet for white peoples&#x27; fear of the unknown and the unfamiliar, and a socially acceptable way of expressing their feelings and fears about race and control. Writes Eric Lott in &quot;Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class&quot;: &quot;The black mask offered a way to play with the collective fears of a degraded and threatening – and male – Other while at the same time maintaining some symbolic control over them.&quot;

Blackface, at least initially, could also give voice to an oppositional dynamic that was prohibited by society. As early as 1832, Thomas D. Rice was singing: &quot;An&#x27; I caution all white dandies not to come in my way, / For if dey insult me, dey&#x27;ll in de gutter lay.&quot; It also on occasion equated lower-class white and lower-class black audiences; while parodying Shakespeare, Rice sang, &quot;Aldough I&#x27;m a black man, de white is call&#x27;d my broder.&quot;

=== 20th century ===

In the early years of film, black characters were routinely played by white people in blackface. In the first filmic adaptation of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1903), all of the major black roles were white people in blackface. Even the 1914 &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; starring African-American actor Sam Lucas in the title role had a white male in blackface as Topsy. D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915) used white people in blackface to represent all of its major black characters, but reaction against the film&#x27;s racism largely put an end to this practice in dramatic film roles. Thereafter, white people in blackface would appear almost exclusively in broad comedies or &quot;ventriloquizing&quot; blackness in the context of a vaudeville or minstrel performance within a film. This stands in contrast to made-up white people routinely playing Native Americans, Asians, Arabs, and so forth, for several more decades.

From the 1910s up until the early 1950s, many well-known entertainers of stage and screen also performed in blackface. Light-skinned people who performed in blackface in film included Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire, Buster Keaton, Joan Crawford, Irene Dunne, Doris Day, Milton Berle, William Holden, Marion Davies, Myrna Loy, Betty Grable, Dennis Morgan, Laurel and Hardy, Betty Hutton, The Three Stooges, The Marx Brothers, Mickey Rooney, Shirley Temple, Judy Garland, Donald O&#x27;Connor and Chester Morris and George E. Stone in several of the &quot;Boston Blackie&quot; films. In 1936, when Orson Welles was touring his &quot;Voodoo Macbeth&quot;; the lead actor, Maurice Ellis, fell ill, so Welles stepped into the role, performing in blackface.

As late as the 1940s, Warner Bros. used blackface in &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; (1942), a minstrel show sketch in &quot;This Is the Army&quot; (1943) and by casting Flora Robson as a Haitian maid in &quot;Saratoga Trunk&quot; (1945). In &quot;The Spoilers&quot; (1942), John Wayne appeared in blackface and bantered in a mock accent with a black maid who mistook him for an authentic black man.

In &quot;Holiday Inn,&quot; Bing Crosby and Marjorie Reynolds sang “Abraham,” a song honoring Lincoln’s birthday, in shoe-polish blackface. The band behind them and the waiters were also in blackface.

Blackface makeup was largely eliminated even from live-action film comedy in the U.S. after the end of the 1930s, when public sensibilities regarding race were beginning to change and blackface became increasingly associated with racism and bigotry. 
Still, the tradition did not end all at once. The radio program &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; (1928–1960) constituted a type of &quot;oral blackface&quot;, in that the black characters were portrayed by white people and conformed to stage blackface stereotypes. The conventions of blackface also lived on unmodified at least into the 1950s in animated theatrical cartoons. Strausbaugh estimates that roughly one-third of late 1940s MGM cartoons &quot;included a blackface, coon, or mammy figure&quot;. Bugs Bunny appeared in blackface at least as late as &quot;Southern Fried Rabbit&quot; in 1953.

Singer Grace Slick was wearing blackface when her band Jefferson Airplane performed &quot;Crown of Creation&quot; and &quot;Lather&quot; at &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; in 1968. A clip is included in a 2004 documentary &quot;Fly Jefferson Airplane&quot;, directed by Bob Sarles.

The 1976 action comedy &quot;Silver Streak&quot; included a farcical scene in which Gene Wilder must impersonate a black man, as instructed by Richard Pryor. In 1980, an underground film, &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot;, was released, directed by Richard Elfman and starring the band Oingo Boingo, which received controversy for blackface sequences.

Also in 1980, the white members of UB40 appeared in blackface in their &quot;Dream a Lie&quot; video, while the black members appeared in whiteface to give the opposite appearance.

&quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983) is a film telling the elaborate story of a commodities banker and street hustler crossing paths after being made part of a bet. The film features a scene between Eddie Murphy, Jamie Lee Curtis, Denholm Elliott, and Dan Aykroyd when they must don disguises to enter a train. Aykroyd&#x27;s character puts on full blackface make-up, a dreadlocked wig and a Jamaican accent to fill the position of a Jamaican pothead. The film, being an obvious satire, has received little criticism for its use of racial and ethnic stereotype due to it mocking the ignorance of Aykroyd&#x27;s character rather than black people as a whole, with Rotten Tomatoes citing it as &quot;featuring deft interplay between Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd, &quot;Trading Places&quot; is an immensely appealing social satire&quot;.

&quot;Soul Man&quot; is a 1986 film featuring C. Thomas Howell as Mark Watson, a pampered rich white college graduate who uses &quot;tanning pills&quot; to qualify for a scholarship to Harvard Law only available to African American students. He expects to be treated as a fellow student and instead learns the isolation of &#x27;being black&#x27; on campus. He later befriends and falls in love with the original candidate of the scholarship, a single mother who works as a waitress to support her education. He later &quot;comes out&quot; as white, leading to the famous defending line: &quot;Can you blame him for the color of his skin?&quot; Unlike &quot;Trading Places&quot;, the film was met with heavy criticism of a white man donning blackface to humanize white ignorance at the expense of African American viewers. Despite a large box office intake, it has scored low on every film critic platform. &quot;A white man donning blackface is taboo,&quot; said Howell; &quot;Conversation over – you can&#x27;t win. But our intentions were pure: We wanted to make a funny movie that had a message about racism.&quot;

==== Parades ====
In the early 20th century, a group of African American laborers began a marching club in the New Orleans Mardi Gras parade, dressed as hobos and calling themselves &quot;The Tramps&quot;. Wanting a flashier look, they renamed themselves &quot;Zulus&quot; and copied their costumes from a blackface vaudeville skit performed at a local black jazz club and cabaret. The result is one of the best known and most striking krewes of Mardi Gras, the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club. Dressed in grass skirts, top hat and exaggerated makeup, the Zulus of New Orleans are controversial as well as popular. The group has, since the 1960s, argued that the black and white makeup they continue to wear is not blackface.

The wearing of blackface was once a regular part of the annual Mummers Parade in Philadelphia. Growing dissent from civil rights groups and the offense of the black community led to a 1964 city policy, ruling out blackface. Despite the ban on blackface, brownface was still used in the parade in 2016 to depict Mexicans, causing outrage once again among civil rights groups. Also in 1964, bowing to pressure from the interracial group Concern, teenagers in [[Norfolk, Connecticut], reluctantly agreed to discontinue using blackface in their traditional minstrel show that was a fundraiser for the [[March of Dimes]].

=== 21st century ===
Commodities bearing iconic &quot;darky&quot; images, from tableware, soap and toy marbles to home accessories and T-shirts, continue to be manufactured and marketed. Some are reproductions of historical [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] (&quot;&quot;), while others are designed for today&#x27;s marketplace (&quot;fantasy&quot;). There is a thriving [[niche market]] for such items in the U.S., particularly. The value of the original examples of darky iconography (vintage negrobilia [[collectable]]s) has risen steadily since the 1970s.

There have been several inflammatory incidents of white college students donning blackface. Such incidents usually escalate around [[Halloween]], with students accused of perpetuating racial stereotypes.

In 1998, [[Harmony Korine]] released &quot;[[The Diary of Anne Frank Pt II]]&quot;, a 40-minute three-screen collage featuring a man in blackface dancing and singing &quot;[[My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean]]&quot;.

Blackface and minstrelsy serve as the theme of African American director [[Spike Lee]]&#x27;s film &quot;[[Bamboozled]]&quot; (2000). It tells of a disgruntled black television executive who reintroduces the old blackface style in a series concept in an attempt to get himself fired and is instead horrified by its success.

In 2000, [[Jimmy Fallon]] performed in blackface on &quot;[[Saturday Night Live]]&quot;, imitating former cast member [[Chris Rock]]. That same year, [[Harmony Korine]] directed the short film &quot;Korine Tap&quot; for &quot;Stop For a Minute&quot;, a series of short films commissioned by [[Dazed &amp; Confused (Magazine)|Dazed &amp; Confused]] magazine and FilmFour Lab. The film featured Korine tap dancing while wearing blackface.

[[Jimmy Kimmel]] donned black paint and used an exaggerated, accented voice to portray [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] player [[Karl Malone]] on &quot;[[The Man Show]]&quot; in 2003. Kimmel repeatedly impersonated the NBA player on &quot;The Man Show&quot; and even made an appearance on [[Crank Yankers]] using his exaggerated [[African-American Vernacular English|Ebonics/African-American Vernacular English]] to prank call about [[Beanie Babies]].

In November 2005, controversy erupted when journalist [[Steve Gilliard]] posted a photograph on his blog. The image was of African American [[Michael Steele]], a politician, then a candidate for [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. It had been doctored to include bushy, white eyebrows and big, red lips. The caption read, &quot;I&#x27;s simple [[Sambo (racial term)|Sambo]] and I&#x27;s running for the big house.&quot; Gilliard, also African-American, defended the image, commenting that the politically conservative Steele has &quot;refused to stand up for his people&quot;. (See .)

In a 2006 reality television program, &quot;[[Black. White.]]&quot;, white participants wore blackface makeup and black participants wore whiteface makeup in an attempt to be better able to see the world through the perspective of the other race.

In 2007, [[Sarah Silverman]] performed in blackface for a skit from &quot;[[The Sarah Silverman Program]]&quot;.

&quot;[[A Mighty Heart (film)|A Mighty Heart]]&quot; is a 2007 American film featuring [[Angelina Jolie]] playing [[Mariane Pearl]], the wife of the kidnapped &quot;[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]&quot; reporter [[Daniel Pearl]]. Mariane is of multiracial descent, born from an Afro-Chinese-Cuban mother and a Dutch Jewish father. She personally cast Jolie to play herself, defending the choice to have Jolie &quot;sporting a spray tan and a corkscrew wig&quot;. Criticism of the film came in large part for the choice to have Jolie portraying Mariane Pearl in this manner. Defense of the casting choice was in large part due to Pearl&#x27;s mixed racial heritage, critics claiming it would have been impossible to find an Afro-Latina actress with the same crowd-drawing caliber of Jolie. Director [[Michael Winterbottom]] defended his casting choice in an interview, &quot;To try and find a French actress who&#x27;s half-Cuban, quarter-Chinese, half-Dutch who speaks great English and could do that part better - I mean, if there had been some more choices, I might have thought, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t we use that person?&#x27;...I don&#x27;t think there would have been anyone better&quot;.

A 2008 imitation of [[Barack Obama]] by American comedian [[Fred Armisen]] (of German, Korean, and Venezuelan descent) on the popular television program &quot;[[Saturday Night Live]]&quot; caused some stir, with &quot;[[The Guardian]]&quot; commentator asking why &quot;SNL&quot; did not hire an additional black actor to do the sketch; the show had only one black cast member at the time.

Also in 2008, [[Robert Downey Jr.]]&#x27;s character Kirk Lazarus appeared in [[brownface]] in the [[Ben Stiller]]-directed film &quot;[[Tropic Thunder]]&quot;. As with &quot;Trading Places&quot;, the intent was satire; specifically, blackface was ironically employed to humorously mock one of the many [[:Category:Entertainment scandals|foibles of Hollywood]] rather than black people themselves. Downey was even nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal. According to Downey, &quot;90 per cent of my black friends were like, &#x27;Dude, that was great.&#x27; I can&#x27;t disagree with [the other 10 per cent], but I know where my heart lies.&quot;

Once more in 2008, comedian [[Frank Caliendo]], who is well known for his [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressions]], used blackface to do an impression of former NBA player and sports analyst [[Charles Barkley]]. Caliendo defended his use of blackface by comparing it positively to [[Ted Danson]]&#x27;s infamous use of it in 1993 at a [[New York Friars Club|Friars]] [[Roast (comedy)|Roast]], which Caliendo said was &quot;the wrong thing to do&quot;. 

In the November 2010 episode &quot;[[List of It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes#Season 6 (2010)|Dee Reynolds: Shaping America&#x27;s Youth]]&quot;, the TV show &quot;[[It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]&quot; comically explored if blackface could ever be done &quot;right&quot;. One of the characters, Frank Reynolds insists that [[Laurence Olivier]]&#x27;s blackface performance in [[Othello (1965 British film)|his 1965 production of &quot;Othello&quot;]] was not offensive, while Dennis claimed it &quot;distasteful&quot; and &quot;never okay&quot;. In the same episode, the gang shows their [[fan film]], &quot;[[Lethal Weapon]] 5&quot;, in which the character Mac appears in blackface. In the season 9 episode &quot;The Gang make Lethal Weapon 6&quot;, Mac once again dons black make-up, along with Dee, who plays his character&#x27;s daughter in the film. Later in the series, the episode &quot;[[The Gang Makes Lethal Weapon 7|The Gang Makes &quot;Lethal Weapon 7&quot;]]&quot; addresses the topic again along with the removal of their films from the library.

A 2012 [[Popchips]] commercial showing actor [[Ashton Kutcher]] with brown make-up on his face impersonating a stereotypical Indian person generated controversy and was eventually pulled by the company after complaints of racism. In the TV series &quot;[[Mad Men]]&quot;, set in the 1960s in New York City, the character [[Roger Sterling]] appears in blackface in the season 3 episode &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot;. [[Julianne Hough]] attracted controversy in October 2013 when she donned blackface as part of a Halloween costume depicting the character of &quot;Crazy Eyes&quot; from &quot;[[Orange Is the New Black]]&quot;. Hough later apologized, stating on Twitter: &quot;I realize my costume hurt and offended people and I truly apologize.&quot;

[[Billy Crystal]] impersonated [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] in the [[84th Academy Awards|2012 Oscars]] opening montage. The scene depicts Crystal in black face-paint wearing an oiled wave wig while talking to [[Justin Bieber]]. In the scene Crystal leaves a parting remark to Bieber, &quot;Have fun storming the [[Führer]]&quot;, a poor association to his famous line in &quot;[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]&quot;, &quot;Have fun storming the castle&quot;.
The skit was remarked as poor taste, considering he was chosen as the &quot;safer&quot; choice after [[Eddie Murphy]] bowed out following producer and creative partner [[Brett Ratner]]&#x27;s homophobic remarks.

[[Victoria Foyt]] was accused of using blackface in the trailer for her [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] novel &quot;[[Save the Pearls: Revealing Eden]]&quot; as well as in the book and its artwork.

Performer [[Chuck Knipp]] (who is white and gay) has used drag, blackface, and broad racial caricature to portray a character named &quot;Shirley Q. Liquor&quot; in his cabaret act, generally performed for all-white audiences. Knipp&#x27;s outrageously stereotypical character has drawn criticism and prompted demonstrations from Black, Gay and [[transgender]] activists.

The [[Metropolitan Opera]], based in New York City, used blackface in productions of the opera &quot;[[Otello]]&quot; until 2015, though some have argued that the practice of using dark makeup for the character did not qualify as blackface.

On February 1, 2019, images from [[Governor of Virginia]] [[Ralph Northam]]&#x27;s medical school yearbook were published on the far-right website &quot;[[Big League Politics]]&quot;. The photos showed an image of Northam in blackface and an unidentified person in a [[Ku Klux Klan]] hood on Northam&#x27;s page in the yearbook. A spokesman for [[Eastern Virginia Medical School]] confirmed that the image appeared in its 1984 yearbook. Shortly after the news broke, Northam apologized for appearing in the photo.

Blackface performances are not unusual within the Latino community of Miami. As Spanish-speakers from different countries, ethnic, racial, class, and educational backgrounds settle in the United States, they have to grapple with being re-classified vis-a-vis other American-born and immigrant groups. Blackface performances have, for instance, tried to work through U.S. racial and ethnic classifications in conflict with national identities. A case in point is the representation of Latino and its popular embodiment as a stereotypical Dominican man.

In the wake of [[George Floyd protests|protests over the treatment of African-Americans]] following the [[murder of George Floyd]] in 2020, episodes of popular television programs featuring characters in blackface were pulled from circulation. This includes &quot;[[The Golden Girls]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Office (American TV series)|The Office]]&quot;, &quot;[[It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]&quot;, &quot;[[30 Rock]]&quot;, &quot;[[Community (TV series)|Community]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]&quot;, among others.

==== Stunt doubles ====
White men are the main source of stunt doubles in American TV and film productions. The practice of a male performer portraying standing-in for a female actor is known as &quot;wigging&quot;. When the stunt performer is made up to look like another race, the practice is called a &quot;paint down&quot;. Stunt performers [[Janeshia Adams-Ginyard]] and Sharon Schaffer have equated it in 2018 with blackface minstrelsy.

==== Digital media ====

Digital media provide opportunities to inhabit and perform Black identity without actually painting one&#x27;s face, which, in a way, some critics have likened to blackface and minstrelsy. In 1999, Adam Clayton Powell III coined the term &quot;high-tech blackface&quot; to refer to stereotypical portrayals of [[List of black video game characters|black characters in video games]]. David Leonard writes, &quot;The desire to &#x27;be Black&#x27; because of the stereotypical visions of strength, athleticism, power and sexual potency all play out within the virtual reality of sports games.&quot; Leonard&#x27;s argument suggests that players perform a type of [[identity tourism]] by controlling Black avatars in sports games. Phillips and Reed argue that this type of blackface &quot;is not only about whites assuming Black roles, nor about exaggerated performances of blackness for the benefit of a racist audience. Rather, it is about performing a version of blackness that constrains it within the boundaries legible to [[white supremacy]].&quot;

In addition, writers such as [[Lauren Michele Jackson]], Victoria Princewill and [[Shafiqah Hudson]] criticized non-Black people sharing animated images, or [[GIF]]s, of Black people or Black-skinned [[emoji]]s, calling the practice &quot;digital blackface&quot;. Writers [[Amanda Hess#The New York Times|Amanda Hess]] and Shane O&#x27;Neill have elaborated on their work, pointing out that GIFs of women of color, in particular, have been most frequently used to express user&#x27;s emotions online. Hess and O&#x27;Neill also suggest that the emoji app [[Bitstrips|Bitmoji]] uses &quot;black emotional reactions and verbal expressions&quot; and designs them to fit non-Black bodies and faces. Writer [[Manuel Arturo Abreu]] refers to this phenomenon as &quot;online imagined Black English&quot;, where non-Black users engage in [[African-American Vernacular English|African American Vernacular English]], or AAVE, on the internet without understanding the full context of the particular phrase being used.

Following these critiques, the term &quot;digital blackface&quot; has since evolved with the rise of other social media and digital media technologies. In 2020, writer Francesa Sobande wrote on the digital representations of Black people, defining digital blackface as &quot;encompassing online depictions and practices that echo the anti-Black underpinnings of [[Minstrel show|minstrelsy shows]] involving non-Black people &#x27;dressing up&#x27; and &#x27;performing&#x27; as though they are Black&quot;. Sobande&#x27;s argument suggests that this acts as a &quot;digital expression of the oppression that Black people face&quot; outside of the internet, where they can be viewed as an objectified type of &quot;[[Commodity#Commodification of labor|commodity or labor tool]]&quot;.

Since the criticisms made by these writers, instances of digital blackface have varied in type across the internet. In 2016, a controversy emerged over social media app [[Snapchat]]&#x27;s [[Bob Marley]] filter, which allowed users to superimpose dark skin, dreadlocks, and a knitted cap over their own faces. A number of controversies have also emerged about students at American universities sharing images of themselves appearing to wear blackface makeup. In 2020, two high school students in Georgia were expelled after posting a &quot;racially insensitive&quot; [[TikTok]] video that used racial slurs and [[Stereotypes of African Americans|stereotypes]] about Black people.

Senior writer [[Jason Parham]] suggests that the social media app [[TikTok]], and its [[TikTok#Viral trends|viral trends and challenges]], has become a new medium for 21st century minstrelsy. Parham argues that &quot;unlike Facebook and Twitter, where instances of digital blackface are either text-based or image-based, TikTok is a video-first platform&quot; where &quot;creators embody Blackness with an auteur-driven virtuosity—taking on Black rhythms, gestures, affect, slang&quot;. Examples of these controversial trends and challenges have included &quot;the Hot Cheeto Girl&quot;, which is said to mimic [[stereotype]]s of Black and Latin women, the &quot;#HowsMyForm&quot; challenge, which plays on racist stereotypes of Black people and other racial groups, and other perceived instances of [[cultural appropriation]], such as &quot;[[blackfishing]]&quot;.

In 2021, conversation around digital blackface gained further traction after [[Oprah Winfrey]]&#x27;s interview with [[Meghan, Duchess of Sussex|Meghan Markle]] and [[Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex|Prince Harry]], where Winfrey&#x27;s reactions during the interview began to circulate the internet in the form of [[meme]]s. A widespread [[Instagram]] post by the Slow Factory Foundation, an activist group founded by [[Céline Semaan Vernon]], calling attention to digital blackface led to many critiques and criticisms about whether or not it was appropriate for non-Black people to continue sharing these images of Winfrey.

==== Universities ====
In 2021, music professor [[Bright Sheng]] [[Bright Sheng#Blackface controversy (2021)|stepped down from teaching]] a [[University of Michigan]] [[musical composition]] class, where he says he had intended to show how [[Giuseppe Verdi]] adapted [[William Shakespeare]]&#x27;s play &quot;[[Othello]]&quot; into his opera &quot;[[Otello]]&quot;, after showing the [[Othello (1965 British film)|1965 British movie &quot;Othello&quot;]], whose actors received 4 [[38th Academy Awards|Oscar nominations]], but in which the white actor [[Laurence Olivier]] played [[Othello (character)|Othello]] in blackface, which caused controversy even at the time. Sheng allegedly failed to give students any warning that the movie contained blackface, and his two subsequent apologies failed to satisfy his critics, with the wording of the second one causing further controversy. There was disagreement over whether showing the blackface performance constituted racism. Evan Chambers, a professor of composition (as is Sheng), said &quot;To show the film now, especially without substantial framing, content advisory and a focus on its inherent racism is in itself a racist act, regardless of the professor&#x27;s intentions&quot;, while David Gier, dean of the School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance, said: &quot;Professor Sheng&#x27;s actions do not align with our School&#x27;s commitment to anti-racist action, diversity, equity and inclusion&quot; But Robert Soave, a senior editor at &quot;[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]&quot; magazine, said that the university had violated the principle of [[academic freedom]], that showing the movie was neither a racist act nor approval of racism, and that the university owed Sheng an apology for unfairly maligning him, and he compared it to Sheng&#x27;s earlier experience of surviving the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]].

=== Black performers in blackface ===
==== 19th century ====
By 1840, black performers also were performing in blackface makeup. [[Frederick Douglass]] generally abhorred blackface and was one of the first people to write against the institution of blackface minstrelsy, condemning it as racist in nature, with inauthentic, northern, white origins. Douglass did, however, maintain: &quot;It is something to be gained when the colored man in any form can appear before a white audience.&quot;

When all-black minstrel shows began to proliferate in the 1860s, they often were billed as &quot;authentic&quot; and &quot;the real thing&quot;. These &quot;colored minstrels&quot; always claimed to be recently freed slaves (doubtlessly many were, but most were not) and were widely seen as authentic. This presumption of authenticity could be a bit of a trap, with white audiences seeing them more like &quot;animals in a zoo&quot; than skilled performers. Despite often smaller budgets and smaller venues, their public appeal sometimes rivaled that of white minstrel troupes. In March 1866, Booker and Clayton&#x27;s Georgia Minstrels may have been the country&#x27;s most popular troupe, and were certainly among the most critically acclaimed.

These &quot;colored&quot; troupes – many using the name &quot;Georgia Minstrels&quot; – focused on &quot;plantation&quot; material, rather than the more explicit social commentary (and more nastily racist stereotyping) found in portrayals of northern black people. In the execution of authentic black music and the [[percussion instrument|percussive]], [[polyrhythm]]ic tradition of &quot;[[Juba dance|pattin&#x27; Juba]]&quot;, when the only [[musical instrument|instruments]] performers used were their hands and feet, clapping and slapping their bodies and shuffling and stomping their feet, black troupes particularly excelled. One of the most successful black minstrel companies was [[Sam Hague]]&#x27;s Slave Troupe of Georgia Minstrels, managed by [[Charles Hicks]]. This company eventually was taken over by [[Charles Callender|Charles Callendar]]. The Georgia Minstrels toured the United States and abroad and later became [[J. H. Haverly|Haverly&#x27;s Colored Minstrels]].

From the mid-1870s, as white blackface minstrelsy became increasingly lavish and moved away from &quot;Negro subjects&quot;, black troupes took the opposite tack. The popularity of the [[Fisk Jubilee Singers]] and other &quot;jubilee singers&quot; had demonstrated northern white interest in white religious music as sung by black people, especially [[spirituals]]. Some jubilee troupes pitched themselves as quasi-minstrels and even incorporated minstrel songs; meanwhile, blackface troupes began to adopt first jubilee material and then a broader range of southern black religious material. Within a few years, the word &quot;jubilee&quot;, originally used by the Fisk Jubilee Singers to set themselves apart from blackface minstrels and to emphasize the religious character of their music, became little more than a synonym for &quot;plantation&quot; material. Where the jubilee singers tried to &quot;clean up&quot; Southern black religion for white consumption, blackface performers exaggerated its more exotic aspects.

African-American blackface productions also contained buffoonery and comedy, by way of self-parody. In the early days of African-American involvement in theatrical performance, black people could not perform without blackface makeup, regardless of how dark-skinned they were. The 1860s &quot;colored&quot; troupes violated this convention for a time: the comedy-oriented endmen &quot;corked up&quot;, but the other performers &quot;astonished&quot; commentators by the diversity of their hues. Still, their performances were largely in accord with established blackface stereotypes.

These black performers became stars within the broad African-American community, but were largely ignored or condemned by the [[African-American upper class|black bourgeoisie]]. [[James Monroe Trotter]]  – a middle-class African American who had contempt for their &quot;disgusting caricaturing&quot; but admired their &quot;highly musical culture&quot; – wrote in 1882 that &quot;few ... who condemned black minstrels for giving &#x27;aid and comfort to the enemy&#x27;&quot; had ever seen them perform. Unlike white audiences, black audiences presumably always recognized blackface performance as caricature, but took pleasure in seeing their own culture observed and reflected, much as they would half a century later in the performances of [[Moms Mabley]].

Despite reinforcing racist stereotypes, blackface minstrelsy was a practical and often relatively lucrative livelihood when compared to the menial labor to which most black people were relegated. Owing to the discrimination of the day, &quot;corking (or blacking) up&quot; provided an often singular opportunity for African-American musicians, actors, and dancers to practice their crafts. Some minstrel shows, particularly when performing outside the South, also managed subtly to poke fun at the racist attitudes and double standards of white society or champion the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] cause. It was through blackface performers, white and black, that the richness and exuberance of [[African-American music]], humor, and dance first reached mainstream, white audiences in the U.S. and abroad. It was through blackface minstrelsy that African American performers first entered the mainstream of American show business. Black performers used blackface performance to satirize white behavior. It was also a forum for the sexual [[double entendre]] gags that were frowned upon by white moralists. There was often a subtle message behind the outrageous vaudeville routines:

==== 20th century ====
With the rise of vaudeville, [[The Bahamas|Bahamian]]-born actor and comedian [[Bert Williams]] became [[Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.|Florenz Ziegfeld]]&#x27;s highest-paid star and only African American star.

In the [[Theatre Owners Booking Association|Theater Owners Booking Association]] (TOBA), an all-black vaudeville circuit organized in 1909, blackface acts were a popular staple. Called &quot;Toby&quot; for short, performers also nicknamed it &quot;Tough on Black Actors&quot; (or, variously, &quot;Artists&quot; or &quot;Asses&quot;), because earnings were so meager. Still, TOBA headliners like [[Tim Moore (comedian)|Tim Moore]] and Johnny Hudgins could make a very good living, and even for lesser players, TOBA provided fairly steady, more desirable work than generally was available elsewhere. Blackface served as a springboard for hundreds of artists and entertainers – black and white – many of whom later would go on to find work in other performance traditions. For example, one of the most famous stars of Haverly&#x27;s European Minstrels was Sam Lucas, who became known as the &quot;Grand Old Man of the [[Negro]] Stage&quot;. Lucas later played the title role in the 1914 cinematic production of [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;.

From the early 1930s to the late 1940s, New York City&#x27;s famous [[Apollo Theater]] in [[Harlem]] featured skits in which almost all black male performers wore the blackface makeup and huge white painted lips, despite protests that it was degrading from the NAACP. The comics said they felt &quot;naked&quot; without it.

The minstrel show was appropriated by the black performer from the original white shows, but only in its general form. Black people took over the form and made it their own. The professionalism of performance came from black theater. Some argue that the black minstrels gave the shows vitality and humor that the white shows never had. As the black social critic [[Amiri Baraka|LeRoi Jones]] has written:

The black minstrel performer was not only poking fun at himself but in a more profound way, he was poking fun at the white man. The [[cakewalk]] is caricaturing white customs, while white theater companies attempted to satirize the cakewalk as a black dance. Again, as LeRoi Jones notes:

=== Puerto Rico ===
During the 20th century, blackface was not an uncommon sight at parades in Puerto Rico. In 2019, when blackface was prominently featured at a carnival in [[San Sebastián, Puerto Rico]], the town immediately faced backlash and criticism.

== Authenticity ==
The degree to which blackface performance drew on authentic black culture and traditions is controversial. Black people, including slaves, were influenced by white culture, including white musical culture. Certainly this was the case with church music from very early times. Complicating matters further, once the blackface era began, some blackface minstrel songs unquestionably written by New York-based professionals (Stephen Foster, for example) made their way to the plantations in the South and merged into the body of black folk music.

It seems clear, however, that American music by the early 19th century was an interwoven mixture of many influences, and that blacks were quite aware of white musical traditions and incorporated these into their music.

Early blackface minstrels often said that their material was largely or entirely authentic black culture; John Strausbaugh, author of &quot;Black Like You&quot;, said that such claims were likely to be untrue. Well into the 20th century, scholars took the stories at face value. [[Constance Rourke]], one of the founders of what is now known as [[cultural studies]], largely assumed this as late as 1931. In the Civil Rights era there was a strong reaction against this view, to the point of denying that blackface was anything other than a white racist counterfeit. Starting no later than Robert Toll&#x27;s &quot;Blacking Up&quot; (1974), a &quot;third wave&quot; has systematically studied the origins of blackface, and has put forward a nuanced picture: that blackface did, indeed, draw on black culture, but that it transformed, stereotyped, and caricatured that culture, resulting in often racist representations of black characters.

As discussed above, this picture becomes even more complicated after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when many blacks became blackface performers. They drew on much material of undoubted slave origins, but they also drew on a professional performer&#x27;s instincts, while working within an established genre, and with the same motivation as white performers to make exaggerated claims of the authenticity of their own material.

Author Strausbaugh summed up as follows: &quot;Some minstrel songs started as Negro folk songs, were adapted by White minstrels, became widely popular, and were readopted by Blacks.&quot; &quot;The question of whether minstrelsy was white or black music was moot. It was a mix, a mutt – that is, it was American music.&quot;

== &quot;Darky&quot; iconography ==
The darky icon itself – [[Googly eyes|googly-eyed]], with inky skin, exaggerated white, pink or red lips, and bright, white teeth – became a common motif in entertainment, children&#x27;s literature, mechanical banks, and other toys and games of all sorts, [[cartoon]]s and [[comic strip]]s, advertisements, jewelry, textiles, postcards, sheet music, food branding and packaging, and other consumer goods.

In 1895, the [[Golliwog]] surfaced in Great Britain, the product of children&#x27;s book illustrator [[Florence Kate Upton]], who modeled her rag doll character after a minstrel doll from her American childhood. &quot;Golly&quot;, as he later affectionately came to be called, had a jet-black face, wild, woolly hair, bright, red lips, and sported formal minstrel attire. The generic British golliwog later made its way back across the Atlantic as dolls, toy tea sets, ladies&#x27; perfume, and in a myriad of other forms. The word &quot;golliwog&quot; may have given rise to the [[List of ethnic slurs|ethnic slur]] &quot;[[wog]]&quot;.


U.S. cartoons from the 1930s and 1940s often featured characters in blackface gags as well as other racial and [[ethnic group|ethnic]] caricatures. The [[United Artists]] 1933 release &quot;[[Mickey&#x27;s Mellerdrammer]]&quot; – the name a corruption of &quot;[[melodrama]]&quot; thought to harken back to the earliest minstrel shows – was a film short based on a production of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; by the Disney characters. The advertising poster for the film shows Mickey with exaggerated, orange lips; bushy, white sidewhiskers.

In the U.S., by the 1950s, the [[NAACP]] had begun calling attention to such portrayals of African Americans and mounted a campaign to put an end to blackface performances and depictions. For decades, darky images had been seen in the branding of everyday products and commodities such as &quot;[[Pickaninny|Picaninny]] Freeze&quot;, the [[Coon Chicken Inn]] [[Chain store|restaurant chain]], and [[Use of nigger in proper names#Commercial products|Nigger Hair Tobacco]]. With the eventual successes of the modern day [[Civil rights movement]], such blatantly racist branding practices ended in the U.S., and blackface became an American [[taboo]]. However, blackface-inspired iconography continued to be used in popular media in other parts of the world.

==Notable instances outside the United States==
Over time, blackface and &quot;darky&quot; iconography became artistic and stylistic devices associated with [[Art Deco]] and the [[Jazz Age]]. By the 1950s and 1960s, particularly in Europe, where it was more widely tolerated, blackface became a kind of &quot;&quot;, [[camp (style)|camp]] convention in some artistic circles. &quot;[[The Black and White Minstrel Show]]&quot; was a popular British musical variety show that featured blackface performers, and remained on British television until 1978 and in stage shows until 1989. Many of the songs were from the [[music hall]], [[Country music|country and western]], and folk traditions. Actors and dancers in blackface appeared in music videos such as [[Grace Jones]]&#x27;s &quot;[[Slave to the Rhythm (Grace Jones song)|Slave to the Rhythm]]&quot; (1985, also part of her touring piece &quot;A One Man Show&quot;), [[Culture Club]]&#x27;s &quot;[[Do You Really Want to Hurt Me]]&quot; (1982) and [[Taco (musician)|Taco]]&#x27;s &quot;[[Puttin&#x27; On the Ritz]]&quot; (1983).

[[Darlie]], a popular toothpaste brand by Hawley &amp; Hazel and sold in parts of [[Asia]], used to be known as &quot;Darkie&quot; and used blackface imagery. In 1989, the blackface imagery was dropped and the English branding changed to &quot;Darlie&quot;.

When trade and tourism produce a confluence of cultures, bringing differing sensibilities regarding blackface into contact with one another, the results can be jarring. When Japanese toymaker [[Sanrio]] Corporation exported a darky-icon character doll (the doll, [[List of Kinnikuman characters|Bibinba]], had fat, pink lips and rings in its ears) in the 1990s, the ensuing controversy prompted Sanrio to halt production.

Trademark for Conguitos, a confection manufactured by the LACASA Group features a tubby, little brown character with full, red lips. It became a topic of controversy after a [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] player compared his black teammate to the character. In Britain, &quot;Golly&quot;, a [[golliwog]] character, fell out of favor in 2001 after almost a century as the trademark of jam producer [[Robertson&#x27;s|James Robertson &amp; Sons]], but the debate still continues whether the golliwog should be banished in all forms from further commercial production and display, or preserved as a treasured childhood icon. In France, the chocolate powder [[Banania]] still uses a face with large red lips derived from the [[Senegalese Tirailleurs]] as its emblem. The licorice brand Tabu, popularized by [[Perfetti Van Melle|Perfetti]] in the middle of the 20th century, introduced in the 1980s a cartoon minstrel mascot inspired by [[Al Jolson]]&#x27;s blackface performance in &quot;[[The Jazz Singer]]&quot;, which is still in use today.

The influence of blackface on branding and advertising, as well as on perceptions and portrayals of black people, generally, can be found worldwide.

=== Australia ===

In October 2009, a talent-search skit on Australian TV&#x27;s &quot;[[Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday]]&quot; reunion show featured a tribute group for [[Michael Jackson]], the &quot;Jackson Jive&quot;, in blackface, with the Michael Jackson character in [[Whiteface (performance)|whiteface]]. American performer [[Harry Connick Jr.|Harry Connick, Jr.]] was one of the guest judges and objected to the act, stating that he believed it was offensive to black people, and gave the troupe a score of zero. The show and the group later apologised to Connick, with the troupe leader of Indian descent stating that the skit was not intended to be offensive or racist.

In 1999, [[Sam Newman]] wore blackface to impersonate legendary Indigenous [[Australian Football League]] footballer [[Nicky Winmar]] after Winmar did not attend a scheduled appearance on the program.

=== Belgium and Netherlands ===
==== Christian traditions: Sinterklaas ====
In the Netherlands and Belgium, people annually celebrate [[Sinterklaas|St. Nicolas Eve]] with [[Sinterklaas]], the Dutch version of [[Saint Nicholas Day|Saint Nicholas]], accompanied by multiple helpers or [[Zwarte Piet|&quot;Zwarte Pieten&quot;]] (Black Petes). The first is typically an older white man similar to the American Santa, while the latter are usually adolescent boys and girls, and men and women in make-up and attire similar to the American blackface. The task of the Pieten is generally to entertain the children with jokes and pranks, and to help Sinterklaas distribute presents and dole out candy. The Pieten wear [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Page (servant)|page boy]] costumes and partake in parades.

The Moorish Zwarte Piet character has been traced back to the middle of the 19th century when Jan Schenkman, a popular children&#x27;s book author, added a black servant to the Sinterklaas story. The &quot;Dag Sinterklaas&quot; TV series written by [[Hugo Matthysen]] in Belgium since the early 1990s provided a non-racial explanation: Zwarte Piet is black not because of his skin, because of sliding through the chimney to deliver presents. Twenty years later, [[Bart Peeters]] (the main actor in the series) stated it is thanks to Matthysen that in Belgium the Sinterklaas event has not been subject of a racism discussion as it has been in the Netherlands, because the series explains that the figure of Zwarte Piet has nothing to do with slavery. However, the original and archetypal Zwarte Piet is believed to be a continuation of a much older custom in which people with blackface appeared in Winter Solstice rituals. In other parts of Western Europe and in Central Europe, black-faced and masked people also perform the role of [[companions of Saint Nicholas]], who is known as Nikolo in Austria, Nikolaus in Germany and Samichlaus in Switzerland. Also on [[St. Martin&#x27;s Day|Saint Martin]]&#x27;s Eve, black-faced men go around in processions through [[Wörgl]] and the Lower [[Inn (river)|Inn]] Valley, in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]].

Due to Zwarte Piet&#x27;s strong aesthetic resemblance to the archetypal US blackface, as well as the dynamics between the blackface servants and the white Sinterklaas, there has been international condemnation of the practice since the 1960s. Some of the stereotypical elements have been toned down in recent decades as a result of increasing protests within the nation. For example, there has been a transition towards applying only a few smears of &#x27;soot&#x27; to the Piet&#x27;s cheeks, rather than apply a full blackface. The public support for changing the character was at 5% (versus 89% opposed to such changes) in 2013, which increased to 26% (versus 68% opposed to such changes) in 2017. However, in 2019, support for changing the character of Zwarte Piet underwent a slight decline, with opposition to changes increasing.

In 2020, following the [[murder of George Floyd]] and worldwide protests against racism, the Dutch prime minister [[Mark Rutte]] (who since 2013 had strongly supported Zwarte Piet and condemned protests against suggestions for change) stated he had changed his mind on the matter and hoped the tradition would die out. Yet, he emphasized not intending to impose an official ban and noted he too retains sympathy towards those who do not want to let go of Zwarte Piet.

=== Canada ===
Up until the early 2000s, white comedians sometimes used makeup to represent a black person, most often as a parody of an actual person. Many of these segments have been aired during the annual New Year&#x27;s Eve TV special [[Bye Bye (TV series)|&quot;Bye Bye&quot;]]. For instance, the 1986 edition features three such skits:
* a multi-ethnic version of the series &quot;Le temps d&#x27;une paix&quot; ([[:fr:Le Temps d&#x27;une paix|fr]]), in which comedienne [[Michèle Deslauriers]] played the character Mémère Bouchard as if she hailed from Africa;
* a reference to a joint concert by Quebec rocker [[Marjo (singer)|Marjo]] and U.S. diva [[Eartha Kitt]], in which Deslauriers and comic [[Dominique Michel]] alluded to Kitt spilling wine on Marjo during the show&#x27;s press conference;
* a mock [[American Express]] commercial spoofing president [[Ronald Reagan]]&#x27;s foreign policy, in which Deslauriers, Michel and actor [[Michel Côté (actor)|Michel Côté]] played Middle Eastern arms buyers.

The Montreal-based satiric group [[Rock et Belles Oreilles]] did its own blackface sketches, for instance when comedian [[Yves Pelletier]] disguised himself as comedian and show host [[Gregory Charles]], making fun of his energetic personality (not of his racial background) on his television game show &quot;Que le meilleur gagne&quot;. RBO also did a parody of a talk show where a stereotypical Haitian man (Pelletier again) was easily offended, as well as a group parody of the Caribbean band [[La Compagnie Créole]] and a sketch about the lines of African-American actors that were mangled in movie translations. Pelletier did another parody of Gregory Charles for the New Year&#x27;s Eve TV special &quot;Le Bye Bye de RBO&quot; in 2006 (as an homage to Charles who had had a particularly successful year), along with a parody of Governor General [[Michaëlle Jean]]. And in RBO&#x27;s 2007 &quot;Bye Bye&quot;, [[Guy A. Lepage]] impersonated a black Quebecer testifying during the [[Reasonable accommodation|Bouchard-Taylor hearings on cultural differences]], while in another sketch, Lepage, Pelletier and [[Bruno Landry]] impersonated injured [[Darfur]] residents.

In September 2011, [[HEC Montréal]] students caused a stir when using blackface to &quot;pay tribute&quot; to Jamaican sprinter [[Usain Bolt]] during Frosh Week. The story went national, and was even covered on CNN. The university students were filmed in Jamaican flag colours, chanting &quot;smoke weed&quot; in a chorus. The university later apologized for the lack of consciousness of its student body.

In May 2013, comedian [[Mario Jean]] ([[:fr:Mario Jean|fr]]) took part in the award show &quot;Le gala des Olivier&quot;, and imitated several fellow comics, donning blackface when he came to [[Boucar Diouf]] ([[:fr:Boucar Diouf|fr]]), a Senegalese-born storyteller. Many Quebec pundits defended the practice and Diouf himself praised Jean for his open-mindedness.

In December 2013, white actor Joel Legendre ([[:fr:Joël Legendre|fr]]) performed in blackface in &quot;Bye Bye 2013&quot;, as part of yet another parody of Gregory Charles, this time as host of the variety show &quot;Le choc des générations&quot;.

In December 2014, the satirical end-of-year production by [[Théâtre du Rideau Vert]], a mainstream theatre company, included a blackface representation of hockey player [[P. K. Subban|P.K. Subban]] by actor Marc Saint-Martin. Despite some criticism the sketch was not withdrawn.

In March 2018, comedian of the year Mariana Mazza ([[:fr:Mariana Mazza|fr]]), whose parents are Arab and Uruguayan, celebrated [[International Women&#x27;s Day]] by putting up a post on her Facebook page which read &quot;Vive la diversité&quot; (Hurray for diversity) and was accompanied by a picture of herself surrounded by eight ethnic variations, including one in a wig and makeup that showed what she&#x27;d look like if she were black. She immediately received a flurry of hate messages and death threats, and two days later, posted another message in which she apologized to whoever had been offended, adding that she had been &quot;naively&quot; trying to &quot;express her support for all these communities&quot;.

In June 2018, theatre director [[Robert Lepage]] was accused of staging scenes that were reminiscent of blackface when he put together the show &quot;[[SLĀV]]&quot; at the Montreal Jazz Festival, notably because white performers were dressed as slaves as they picked cotton. After two initial performances, lead singer [[Béatrice Bonifassi|Betty Bonifassi]] broke an ankle and the rest of the summer run was canceled, but later performances were nevertheless scheduled in other venues. The controversy prompted further protests about the play &quot;Kanata&quot; that Lepage was to stage in Paris about the [[Canadian Indian residential school system]] – without resorting to any indigenous actors. The project was briefly put on hold when investors pulled out, but the production eventually resumed as planned.

In 2022, Netflix pulled episode 2 of the popular TV series &quot;[[Les Filles de Caleb|Les filles de Caleb]]&quot; (which takes place in the 19th century), because the main character, played by [[Roy Dupuis]], dons blackface makeup in order to act as magus [[Balthazar (magus)|Balthazar]] in a school [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] play.

====Justin Trudeau blackface controversy====
In 2019, [[Time (magazine)|&quot;Time&quot;]] published a photograph of the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Justin Trudeau]], wearing [[racial brownface|brownface]] makeup in the spring of 2001. The photograph, which had not been previously reported, was taken at an &quot;[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]&quot;-themed gala. The photograph showed Trudeau, wearing a turban and robes with his face, neck and hands completely darkened. The photograph appeared in the 2000–2001 yearbook of the [[West Point Grey Academy]], where Trudeau was a teacher. A copy of the yearbook was obtained by &quot;Time&quot; earlier in the month from Vancouver businessman Michael Adamson, who was part of the West Point Grey Academy community. Adamson said that he first saw the photograph in July and felt it should be made public. On September 19, 2019, [[Global News]] obtained and published a video from the early 1990s showing Trudeau in blackface. The video showed Trudeau covered in dark makeup and raising his hands in the air while laughing, sticking his tongue out and making faces. The video showed his arms and legs covered in makeup as well as a banana in his pants, eliciting strong negative reactions. Trudeau admitted that he could not recall how many times he wore blackface after additional footage surfaced.

=== China ===
In May 2016, a global controversy broke regarding a television commercial for Qiaobi clothes washing fluid. The commercial showed a pouch of cleaning liquid being forced into a black man&#x27;s mouth before he is pushed into a washing machine. He emerges later as an Asian man.

On February 15, 2018, a comedy sketch titled &quot;Same Joy, Same Happiness&quot; intending to celebrate [[Africa–China relations|Chinese-African ties]] on the [[CCTV New Year&#x27;s Gala]], which draws an audience of up to 800 million, showed a Chinese actress in blackface makeup with a giant fake bottom playing an African mother, while a performer only exposing black arms playing a monkey accompanied her. At the end of the skit, the actress shouted, &quot;I love Chinese people! I love China!&quot; After being broadcast, the scene was widely criticized as being &quot;disgusting&quot;, &quot;awkward&quot; and &quot;completely racist&quot; on Twitter and [[Sina Weibo]]. According to the street interviews by the [[Associated Press]] in Beijing on February 16, some Chinese people believed this kind of criticism was overblown. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman [[Geng Shuang]], who also watched the skit, said that China had consistently opposed any form of racism, and added, &quot;I want to say that if there are people who want to seize on an incident to exaggerate matters, and sow discord in China&#x27;s relations with African countries, this is a doomed futile effort&quot; at a daily news briefing on February 22, 2018.

In 2021 CCTV&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Gala show once again featured performers in blackface wearing approximations of African clothing. Like in 2018 it received criticism both within China and internationally. The Chinese foreign ministry responded to criticism by saying that it was not an issue and that anyone saying otherwise must have ulterior motives.

=== Colombia ===
The television comedy &quot;[[Sábados Felices]]&quot; included a blackface character, who after a controversy changed his makeup to look like a camouflaged soldier.

=== Ecuador ===

In [[Ecuador]], there&#x27;s a traditional festival held in [[Latacunga]] called &quot;[[Mama Negra|La Mama Negra]]&quot; also known as &quot;La Santísima Tragedia&quot; in which a man in blackface makeup portrays a black woman liberated from slavery holding her youngest child.

=== Finland ===
In Finland, a version of the [[Star singers|Star boys]]&#x27; singing procession originating in the city of [[Oulu]], a musical play known as Tiernapojat, has become established as a cherished Christmas tradition nationwide. The Tiernapojat show is a staple of Christmas festivities in schools, kindergartens, and elsewhere, and it is broadcast every Christmas on radio and television. The Finnish version contains non-biblical elements such as [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] vanquishing the &quot;king of the [[Moors]]&quot;, whose face in the play has traditionally been painted black. The character&#x27;s color of skin is also a theme in the procession&#x27;s lyrics.

The last installation of the &quot;[[Pekka and Pätkä]]&quot; comedy film series, &quot;[[Pekka ja Pätkä neekereinä]]&quot; (Pekka and Pätkä as Negroes), was made in 1960. In the film a computer tells the title characters that a &quot;negro&quot; would be a suitable profession for them. They blacken their faces and pretend to be American or African entertainers performing in a night club, talking self-invented [[gibberish]] that is supposed to be English. The computer meant &quot;negro&quot; as a now archaic term for a journalist, which originates from journalists&#x27; hands becoming tinted black with ink when handling prints. When Finland&#x27;s national public broadcasting company [[Yle]] aired this film 2016, some people on the social media disapproved of it and insisted that the film should have been censored, or at least the name changed. A representative from Yle said that an old movie should be evaluated in the context of its own time, and that the idea of the movie is to laugh at people being prejudiced. When the film series was aired in 2019, this particular film of the series was left unaired.

Before the 1990s the word &quot;neekeri&quot; (negro) was generally considered a neutral, inoffensive word.

=== Germany ===
Examples of theatrical productions include the many productions of the play &quot;Unschuld&quot; (&quot;Innocence&quot;) by the German writer [[Dea Loher]]. The play features two black African immigrants, but the use of black-face is not part of the stage directions or instructions. The staging of the play at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin in 2012 was subject of protest. The activist group &quot;Bühnenwatch&quot; (stage watch) performed a stunt in one of the stagings: 42 activists, posing as spectators, left the audience without a word and later distributed leaflets to the audience. Fundamental of the criticism was that the use of black-face solidifies stereotypes regardless of any good intentions and supports racist structures. The critics were invited to a discussion with the director, actors, theatre manager and other artists of the Deutsches Theater. As a result of the discussion, Deutsches Theater changed the design of actor make-up. Ulrich Khuon, the theatre manager, later admitted to being surprised by the protest and is now in a process of reflection.

German productions of [[Herb Gardner]]&#x27;s &quot;[[I&#x27;m Not Rappaport]]&quot; almost always cast the role of Midge Carter, the black character, famously portrayed in the U.S. by [[Ossie Davis]], with a white actor in black makeup. The 2012 production of the play at the Berlin Schlosspark-Theater was the subject of protest. The director, Thomas Schendel, in his response to critics, argued that the classical and common plays would not offer enough roles that would justify a repertoire position for a black actor in a German theatre company. The protest grew considerably and was followed by media reports. While advocates of the theatre indicated that in principle it should be possible for any actor to play any character and that the play itself has an anti-racist message, the critics noted that the letter unwittingly disclosed the general, unexpressed policy of German theatres, i.e., that white actors are accounted to be qualified for all roles, even black ones, while black actors are suitable only for black roles. Other authors said that this problem in Germany generally exists for citizens with an immigrant background. The debate also received foreign media attention. The Schlosspark-Theater announced plans to continue the performances, and the German publishing company of &quot;Rappaport&quot; stated it will continue to grant permits for such performances.

German dramatists commented on the debate:

In 2012, the American dramatist [[Bruce Norris (playwright)|Bruce Norris]] cancelled a German production of his play &quot;Clybourne Park&quot; when it was disclosed that a white actress would portray the African-American &quot;Francine&quot;. A subsequent production using black German actors was successfully staged.

=== Guatemala ===
Guatemalan 2015 elected president, [[Jimmy Morales]], was a comic actor. One of the characters he impersonated in his comic show &quot;Moralejas&quot; was called Black Pitaya which used blackface makeup. Jimmy Morales defended his blackface character saying he is adored by the country&#x27;s black Garifuna and indigenous Mayan communities.

=== Iran ===

[[Hajji Firuz]] is a character in [[Iranian folklore]] who appears in the streets by the beginning of the New Year festival of [[Nowruz]]. Additionally there is &quot;Siah-Bazi&quot;, a type of [[Persian theatre]] in Iran that involves a blackfaced character.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, in the early 1960s, a toy called Dakkochan became hugely popular. &quot;Dakkochan&quot; was a black child with large red lips and a grass skirt. There were boy and girl dolls, with the girls being distinguished by a bow. The black skin of the dolls was said to have been significant and in-line with the rising popularity of jazz. Novelist Tensei Kawano went as far as to state, &quot;We of the younger generation are outcasts from politics and society. In a way we are like Negroes, who have a long record of oppression and misunderstanding, and we feel akin to them.&quot;

Some Japanese manga and [[anime]] have featured characters accused of being inspired by &quot;darky&quot; iconography, which includes [[Mr. Popo]] from the &quot;[[Dragon Ball]]&quot; series and the design of the [[Pokémon]] character [[Jynx]]. Both Mr. Popo and Jynx have been censored on American broadcasting, with Mr. Popo being turned bright blue and given orange-yellow lips instead. 

In [[Japanese hip hop]], a subculture of hip-hoppers subscribe to the &quot;burapan&quot; style, and are referred to as blackfacers. The appearance of these blackfacers is evidence of the popularity of the hip-hop movement in Japan despite what is described as racist tendencies in the culture. It was reported in 2006 that some Japanese hip-hop fans found it embarrassing and ridiculous for fans to change their appearance with blackface in attempt to embrace the culture. In some instances it could be seen as a racist act, but for many of the young Japanese fans it was seen as an appropriate way of immersing in the hip hop culture. The use of blackface is seen by some as a way to rebel against the culture of surface images in Japan.

Blackface has also been a contentious issue in the music scene outside of hip hop. One Japanese R&amp;B group, the Gosperats, has been known to wear blackface makeup during performances. In March 2015 a music television program produced by the [[Fuji TV]] network was scheduled to show a segment featuring two Japanese groups performing together in blackface, [[Rats &amp; Star]] and [[Momoiro Clover Z]]. A picture was published online by one of the Rats &amp; Star members after the segment was recorded, which led to a campaign against broadcasting of the segment. The program that aired on March 7 was edited by the network to remove the segment &quot;after considering the overall circumstances&quot;, but the announcement did not acknowledge the campaign against the segment.

=== Mexico ===
In modern-day Mexico there are examples of images (usually caricatures) in blackface (e.g., [[Memín Pinguín]]). Though there is backlash from international communities, Mexican society has not protested to have these images changed to racially sensitive images. On the contrary, in the controversial Memín Pinguín cartoon there has been support publicly and politically, such as from the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs [[Luis Ernesto Derbez]]. Currently in Mexico only 3–4% of the population are [[Afro-Mexicans]] (this percentage includes [[Asian Mexicans]]).

=== Panama ===
Portobelo&#x27;s Carnival and Congo dance in Panama include a use of blackface as a form of celebration of [[History of Africa|African history]], an emancipatory symbol. Black men paint their faces with charcoal which represents three things. Firstly, the blackface is used as a tool to remember their African ancestors. Secondly, the black face is representative of the disguise or concealment on the run which slaves would have used to evade the Spanish colonizers. Lastly, the practice of blackface is used as a way to signify the code or &quot;secret language&quot; which slaves would have used during the time of the Spanish occupation. During the celebration, for example, good morning will mean good night, and wearing black, or in this case wearing blackface, which normally denotes a time of mourning, is instead used as a way to represent a time of celebration.

=== Philippines ===

In 2011, a [[Philippine television drama|television drama in the Philippines]] titled &quot;[[Nita Negrita]]&quot; was widely criticized in the media and by academics. 

=== Portugal and Brazil ===
Use of black performance in impersonations was quite frequently used in the impressions show &quot;A Tua Cara não Me É Estranha&quot;, with blackface impressions of [[Michael Jackson]], [[Siedah Garrett]], [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Louis Armstrong|Louie Armstrong]], [[Nat King Cole]], among others. In 2018, Eduardo Madeira dressed up as Serena Williams, adding an African accent the tennis player does not have in real life.

In Brazil, there has been at least some history of non-comedic use of blackface, using white actors for black characters like [[Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin|Uncle Tom]] (although the practice of &quot;racelift&quot;, or making black/mulatto characters into [[mestizo|mestiços]]/swarthy whites/[[caboclo]]s, is more frequent than blackface). Use of blackface in humor has been used more rarely than in Portugal, although it also continues into this century (but it creates major uproar among the sizeable and more politically active [[Afro-Brazilians|Afro-Brazilian]] community).

=== Russia ===
Soviet Russian writers and illustrators sometimes inadvertently perpetuated stereotypes about other nations that are now viewed as harmful. For example, a Soviet children&#x27;s book or cartoon might innocently contain a representation of black people that would be perceived as unquestionably offensive by the modern-day western standards, such as bright red lips and other exaggerated features, similar to the portrayal of blacks in American minstrel shows. Soviet artists &quot;did not quite understand the harm of representing black people in this way, and continued to employ this method, even in creative productions aimed specifically at critiquing American race relations&quot;.

In 1910, the ballet &quot;[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Sheherazade]]&quot;, choreographed by [[Michel Fokine|Michael Fokine]], premiered in Russia. The story behind the ballet was inspired by a tone poem written by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]. In the ballet the leading female character, Zobeide, is seduced by a Golden Slave. The dancer who portrayed the Golden Slave, the first being [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], would have his face and body painted brown for the performance. This was done to show the audience the slave was of a darker complexion. Later in 1912, Fokine choreographed the ballet &quot;[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]&quot;, which centers around three puppets that come to life, Petrushka, the Ballerina, and the Moor. When the ballet premiered, the part of the Moor, first danced by Alexander Orlov, was performed in full blackface. The Moor puppet is first seen onstage playing with a [[coconut]], which he attempts to open with his [[scimitar]]. His movements are apelike. The Moor seduces the Ballerina and later savagely cuts off the head of the puppet Petrushka. When &quot;Petrushka&quot; is performed today, the part of the Moor is still done in full blackface, or occasionally blueface. The blackface has not been publicly criticized in the ballet community. Black and brownface appear in other ballets today, such as &quot;[[La Bayadère]]&quot; and &quot;[[Othello]]&quot;, in the United States and Europe.

The early Soviet political cartoon &quot;[[Black and White (1932 film)|Black and White]]&quot;, created in 1932, managed to avoid the blackface style, confronting &quot;precisely that paternalistic model of the ever-passive black subject awaiting enlightenment from the Comintern&quot;. The cartoon integrated &quot;an avant-garde-influenced visual aesthetic with images derived from the many newspaper illustrations, cartoons, and posters of American racism that appeared in Soviet Russia at this time&quot;.

Soviet theater and movie directors rarely had access to black actors, and so resorted to using black makeup when dictated by the character&#x27;s descent. Soviet actors portrayed black people mostly by darkening the skin and occasionally adjusting the hair style, without accentuating or exaggerating their facial features. In particular, [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] performed the role of [[Abram Petrovich Gannibal]], an 18th-century Russian general of African origin, in the 1976 Soviet film &quot;[[How Czar Peter the Great Married Off His Moor]]&quot;, while [[Larisa Dolina]] performed the role of Cuban singer Clementine Fernandez in the 1983 film &quot;[[We Are from Jazz]]&quot;. The [[Othello (1956 film)|1956 Soviet film adaptation]] of [[Othello]] received the Best Director Award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival.

On November 30, 2020, in a segment of the Russian TV show &quot;International Sawmill&quot;, Russian television presenter [[Tigran Keosayan]] interviewed an actress in blackface posing as former United States President [[Barack Obama]]. In the segment, Keosayan, referring to Obama&#x27;s book &quot;[[A Promised Land]]&quot;, asks the actress: &quot;Do you consider this book your achievement?&quot;, to which the actress in blackface replies: &quot;Of course.&quot; Keosayan then asks: &quot;Because none of your relatives have written books?&quot;, after which the actress answers: &quot;Because none of my relatives that came before me could write.&quot; Keosayan then states &quot;you should have become a rap musician, not the president&quot;. The segment was widely deemed racist.

===Spain===

On the eve of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of the Epiphany]], it is tradition in Spanish cities to hold a colorful parade where three men are disguised as the [[Biblical Magi]] and throw candy and presents to the children watching the parade. One of these three men is usually in blackface to depict [[Balthazar (magus)|Balthazar]], as such magus is often depicted as a black African. Such a display in Madrid in 2014 led to widespread discussions and to petitions calling for an end to the blackface practice, and to have Balthazar portrayed by a person of color.

=== South Africa ===
Inspired by blackface minstrels who visited [[Cape Town]], South Africa, in 1848, former [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] [[coolie]]s took up the minstrel tradition, holding emancipation celebrations which consisted of music, dancing and parades. Such celebrations eventually became consolidated into an annual, year-end event called the &quot;Coon Carnival&quot; but now known as the Cape Town Minstrel Carnival or the [[Kaapse Klopse]].

Today, carnival minstrels are mostly [[Coloureds|Coloured]] (&quot;mixed race&quot;), [[Afrikaans]]-speaking revelers. Often in a pared-down style of blackface which exaggerates only the lips. They parade down the streets of the city in colorful costumes, in a celebration of [[Creole peoples|Creole]] culture. Participants also pay homage to the carnival&#x27;s African-American roots, playing [[Spirituals|Negro spirituals]] and [[jazz]] featuring traditional [[Dixieland]] jazz instruments, including [[Brass instrument|horns]], [[banjo]]s, and tambourines.

The South African actor and filmmaker [[Leon Schuster]] is well known for employing the blackface technique in his filming to little or no controversy. But in 2013, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (South Africa)|Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa]] halted the airing of an ad wherein Schuster portrayed a stereotypically dishonest African politician in blackface. The action was in response to the following submitted complaint:

[[Vodacom]] South Africa has also been accused of using non-African actors in blackface in its advertising as opposed to simply using African actors. Some have denounced blackface as an artefact of apartheid, accusing broadcasters of lampooning Black people. Others continue to see it as &quot;harmless fun&quot;. In 2014, photos of two white [[University of Pretoria]] female students donning blackface makeup in an attempt at caricaturing Black [[domestic workers]] surfaced on Facebook. The students were said to face disciplinary action for throwing the institution&#x27;s name into disrepute.

=== South Korea ===

Comedians in many Asian countries continue to occasionally use minstrel-inspired blackface, with considerable frequency in South Korea. &quot;Acting black&quot; has been a common phenomenon in South Korean media for more than 30 years: in the 80s, comedians used to perform with darkened faces without attracting criticism. Although criticism has increased, use of blackface in Korean media was still occurring in 2018: a performer used blackface in a TV show, a play called &quot;The Blacks&quot; used blackface. In 2020, &quot;[[The Diplomat (magazine)|The Diplomat]]&quot; reported that backlash to pictures posted by students in which they posed in blackface for Halloween was indicative of growing consciousness toward racism in the country.

=== Taiwan ===
Taiwanese YouTube comedy group The Wackyboys came under fire after some of its members blackfaced for a [[Dancing Pallbearers]] parody video. The group later apologised and deleted the video.

=== Thailand ===
In [[Thailand]], actors darken their faces to portray [[Semang|the Negrito of Thailand]] in a popular play by King [[Chulalongkorn]] (1868–1910), &quot;[[Ngo Pa]]&quot;, which has been turned into a musical and a movie.

Blackface have been used in commercials in Thailand, as with some other parts of Asia. In 2012, [[The Bangkok Post]] reported on a line of cleaning products in Thailand named &quot;Black Man&quot;.

=== Turkey ===
In Turkey, the actor [[Tevfik Gelenbe]] used blackface to portray Arab &quot;[[Mammy stereotype|mammy]]&quot; characters throughout his career, from the 1960s through to the 1980s.

=== United Kingdom ===
==== Poachers and rioters ====
From 1723 to 1823, it was a criminal offence to blacken one&#x27;s face in some circumstances, with a punishment of death. The [[Black Act 1723|Black Act]] was passed at a time of economic downturn that led to heightened social tensions, and in response to a series of raids by two groups of [[poaching|poachers]] who blackened their faces to prevent identification. Blackening one&#x27;s face with soot, lampblack, boot polish or coal dust was a traditional form of disguise, or masking, especially at night when poaching.

The Welsh [[Rebecca Riots|Rebecca Rioters]] (1839–1843) used to blacken their faces or wear masks to prevent themselves being identified whilst breaking down [[Turnpike trust|turnpike gates]], sometimes [[History of cross-dressing|disguised as women]].

==== Folk culture ====
South Western English traditional [[folk play]]s sometimes have a Turk Slaver character, probably from the [[Barbary pirates|Barbary Coast Slave raids]] on Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and Somerset in the early 17th Century by &quot;[[Salé Rovers|Sallee Rovers]]&quot; (where the English were the slaves captured and taken by force to North Africa). This character is usually played using a black face (or brownface).

Throughout the country, the Turkish ([[Saracen]]) Knight character (probably harkening back to the [[crusades]] during the [[Middle Ages|Medieval era]]) in traditional English Mummers&#x27; plays was played in blackface (or brownface), though less often in the modern era.

Various forms of [[folk dance]] in England, including [[Morris dance|Morris dancing]], have traditionally used blackface; its continuing use by some troupes is controversial. Some interpretations trace the original invention of blackface back to [[Blackface and Morris dancing|specific morris traditions]].

[[Molly dance]]rs and [[Guise dancing|Cornish Guise Dancers]], traditionally associated with midwinter festivals, often use blacked faces as a disguise. The Molly dancers wished to avoid being identified by the landlords and petty nobles, who were also usually the local magistrates, when they played tricks on those who failed to be generous enough in their gifts to the dancers. The Guise dancers (disguised dancers) also wished to avoid any punishment for their mocking songs embarrassing the local gentry.

Some traditional mummers groups perform the English folk play &quot;St George and the Turkish Knight&quot; with the entire cast, including Father Christmas, and all the white, English characters in mummers&#x27; blackface.

In [[Bacup]], Lancashire, the [[Britannia Coconut Dancers]] wear black faces. Some believe the origin of this dance can be traced back to the influx of Cornish miners to northern England, and the black face relates to the dirty blackened faces associated with mining.

In [[Cornwall]], several [[Mummer&#x27;s Day]] celebrations are still held; these used to be sometimes known as &quot;Darkie Day&quot; (a corruption of the original &quot;Darking Day&quot;, referring to the darkening or painting of the faces) and involved local residents dancing through the streets in blackface to musical accompaniment. As late as 2014, at least one festival ([[Padstow]]) featured such songs as &#x27;Old Uncle Ned&#x27;, which includes the lyrics &quot;He&#x27;s gone where the good niggers go&quot;.

The traditional [[Chimney-sweeps (folklore)|wedding day chimney sweep]], that is considered to be good luck, sometimes has a partially blacked up face to suggest smears of soot. This depends on the performer but it was, and still is, unusual to have a full blackening. Though the complete covered &quot;greyface&quot; is known.

These two traditions, of chimney sweep and folk dancing, coincide in the sometimes lost traditions of (chimney) sweepers festivals. [[Medway Council]] supports the Sweeps&#x27; Festival, revived in 1981, now claimed to be &quot;the largest festival of Morris dance in the world&quot;. It takes place in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] around May Day and features a [[Jack in the Green]] character. Originally the chimney sweeps were little boys, and they used the day to beg for money, until this [[Child labour#Britain|child labour was outlawed]].

On [[Guy Fawkes Night|Guy Fawkes&#x27; Day]] 2017, participants in the [[Lewes Bonfire]], the best known of the [[Sussex Bonfire Societies|Sussex bonfire tradition]], decided to abandon black face paint in their depiction of [[Zulu people|Zulu]] warriors.

On July 3, 2020, the [[Joint Morris Organisation]] announced that all three constituent bodies, representing the vast majority of Morris Dancing in the United Kingdom, would be actively moving to eliminate the use of full-face black makeup from their membership.

==== &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot; ====
&quot;[[The Black and White Minstrel Show]]&quot; was a British light entertainment show that ran for twenty years on BBC prime-time television. Beginning in 1958, it was a variety show which presented traditional American minstrel and country songs, as well as show tunes and music hall numbers, lavishly costumed. It was also a successful stage show which ran for ten years from 1962 to 1972 at the Victoria Palace Theatre, London. This was followed by tours of UK seaside resorts, together with Australia and New Zealand.

Due to its employment of artists wearing blackface, the show was seen by UK anti-racist groups such as the [[Campaign Against Racial Discrimination]], to be both racist and perpetuating ethnic stereotypes.

== Legacy ==
Blackface minstrelsy was the conduit through which African-American and African-American-influenced music, comedy, and dance first reached the white American mainstream. It played a seminal role in the introduction of African-American culture to world audiences.

Many of country&#x27;s earliest stars, such as [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]
and [[Bob Wills]], were veterans of blackface performance. More recently, the American country music television show &quot;[[Hee Haw]]&quot; (1969–1993) had the format and much of the content of a minstrel show, albeit without blackface.

The immense popularity and profitability of blackface were testaments to the power, appeal, and commercial viability of not only black music and dance, but also of black style. This led to cross-cultural collaborations, as Giddins writes; but the often ruthless exploitation of African-American artistic genius, as well – by other, white performers and composers; agents; promoters; publishers; and record company executives.

While blackface in the literal sense has played only a minor role in entertainment in recent decades, various writers see it as epitomizing an appropriation and imitation of black culture that continues today. As noted above, Strausbaugh sees blackface as central to a longer tradition of &quot;displaying Blackness&quot;. &quot;To this day,&quot; he writes, &quot;Whites admire, envy and seek to emulate such supposed innate qualities of Blackness as inherent musicality, natural athleticism, the composure known as &#x27;cool&#x27; and superior sexual endowment&quot;, a phenomenon he views as part of the history of blackface. For more than a century, when white performers have wanted to appear sexy (like [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] or [[Mick Jagger]]), or streetwise (like [[Eminem]]), or hip (like [[Mezz Mezzrow]]), they often have turned to African-American performance styles, stage presence and personas. Pop culture referencing and cultural appropriation of African-American performance and stylistic traditions is a tradition with origins in blackface minstrelsy.

This &quot;browning&quot;, à la [[Richard Rodriguez]], of American and world popular culture began with blackface minstrelsy. It is a continuum of pervasive African-American influence which has many prominent manifestations today, among them the ubiquity of the [[Cool (aesthetic)|cool aesthetic]] and [[Hip hop|hip hop culture]].

<doc id="89709" wikidata="Q2892092" url="?curid=89709" title="The Lady Chablis">
<text>The Lady Chablis (March 11, 1957 – September 8, 2016), also known as The Grand Empress and The Doll, was an American actress, author, and transgender club performer. Through exposure in the bestselling nonfiction book &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot;, and its 1997 film adaptation, she became one of the first trans performers to be introduced to a wide audience.

== Early life ==
Born Benjamin Edward Knox in 1957, Knox grew up in Quincy, Florida. Her parents divorced when she was five, and she was supported by her aunt, Katie Bell, and grandmother, Anna Mae Ponder, after her mother moved to Chicago to be a nurse. Chablis did not meet her mother until she was nine, or her father until she was 12. She went on to live with her father in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City in 1969.

She changed her name to &quot;The Lady Chablis&quot; when she was 16 years old and living in Atlanta. &quot;My mom was going to have a baby and she miscarried. The baby&#x27;s name was going to be La Quinta Chablis and she told me to take the name. I didn&#x27;t even know what Chablis was.&quot;

Chablis&#x27; mother moved back to Florida and practiced nursing at Sunland Hospital in Tallahassee. She lived with her mother and her new husband, who owned a dry-cleaning business. Chablis became close to her neighbor, Connie, who offered her a lot of support and a refuge from homophobic troubles at home.

== Career ==
Chablis began her career at age 15 in the Fox Trot gay bar in Tallahassee. It was there that she met Cliff Taylor, who performed under the pseudonym of Miss Tina Devore. He was the first male in Quincy that Chablis ever met who dressed up. Taylor offered to have Chablis stay with him if she ever moved to Atlanta. She moved there in 1974 at the age of 17, previously living with her aunt in Tallahassee for about eighteen months.

She began working at the Prince George Inn, a gay-owned restaurant, where she began a relationship with one of her co-workers. She left in 1975 after the relationship ended, and picked up work at Eckerd&#x27;s Drugstore. After becoming sick for three weeks, she had to leave that position too. A new friend, Linda, saw the decline in Chablis&#x27; health and moved her into her two-bedroom apartment. She found another job, this time at a Burlington Coat Factory outlet.

Chablis and Linda moved to Regency Woods apartment complex. Encouraged by her friend&#x27;s lush life and surroundings, Chablis decided to return to the stage. She eventually found herself at The Locker Room, a bathhouse.

In the late 1980s, a job offer from The Friends Lounge, a cabaret bar in Savannah, Georgia, resulted in her moving south from Atlanta.

She performed at Club One on its opening night in 1988, and was a regular performer there until August 6, 2016, just before she was hospitalized.

In the early 1990s, she moved with her partner, Jesse, to Columbia, South Carolina, where she began working at a new spot, The Menage. The Menage closed after three years, due to new competition, and Chablis did not find much work for a couple of years.

Chablis returned to Savannah, beginning work at new club, The Edge. She lived on the western side of Crawford Square.

She was a prominent character in John Berendt&#x27;s best-selling 1994 book &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot;, during her days working at The Pickup on Congress Street. She left her job in a dispute over pay.

Chablis frequently performed at her &quot;home&quot; nightclub of Club One, where she was known as the &quot;Grand Empress&quot;. Chablis traveled the U.S. performing her show, &quot;The Doll Revue&quot;, at various venues and special events, such as gay pride gatherings. She also appeared on radio shows.

Chablis&#x27; autobiography &quot;Hiding My Candy: The Autobiography of the Grand Empress of Savannah&quot; was published in 1996, a year before she played herself in the Clint Eastwood-directed movie adaptation of &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot;, starring Kevin Spacey and John Cusack.

The Lady Chablis was featured in the closing segment of the Savannah episode of &quot;Bizarre Foods America&quot; on The Travel Channel. She joined host Andrew Zimmern at several Savannah restaurants including Elizabeth on 37th. In 2012, she was interviewed in Savannah on the local television and internet talk show &quot;MAMA Knows Best&quot; (season 2, episode 1). On April 19, 2013, Chablis performed for the grand opening of the short-lived Mama&#x27;s Cabaret in Lewiston, Maine, with &quot;MAMA&quot; Savannah Georgia.

=== Awards and titles ===
In her early career as an entertainer, under the name Brenda Dale Knox, she won multiple titles in drag pageantry including:

* &quot;Bizarre Foods America: Savannah&quot; (2012) as Herself
* &quot;Real Housewives of Atlanta&quot; (2013) as Herself

== Personal life ==
Chablis said she did not want any label except her name, &quot;The Lady Chablis&quot;, and said she found it hurtful when people called her a &quot;drag queen&quot;. In his book, Berendt wrote that he met Chablis as she was returning home from having a hormone injection. In her book &quot;Hiding My Candy&quot;, Chablis said she had not undergone sex reassignment surgery.

== Death ==
The Lady Chablis died on September 8, 2016, from &quot;Pneumocystis&quot; pneumonia, aged 59, following a month-long stay at Savannah&#x27;s Candler Hospital.

On November 5, a special screening of &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot; was shown at Savannah&#x27;s Lucas Theatre for the Arts, with a tribute to Chablis beforehand. A few of Chablis&#x27; gowns were on display in the theatre&#x27;s lobby. Jerry Spence, the former hairdresser who appeared in both the book and movie, was in attendance. A reception was held at Club One after the memorial service and, after the movie screening, Club One Cabaret held two Lady Chablis tribute shows.

===Tributes===
Upon news of her death, several of Chablis&#x27; former co-stars made tributes to her. Paul Hipp, alongside whom she appeared in the movie adaptation of &quot;Midnight in the Garden&quot;, said: &quot;So sad to hear of The Lady Chablis&#x27; passing. She was super talented, kind, and laugh out loud funny. She was a true transgender pioneer, way ahead of her time (in the Deep South, no less). This pic of The Lady and me was taken between shots while filming &quot;Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil&quot;. Feel free to envy our glamour.&quot; Chablis was impersonated on the second episode of Season 7 of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race All Stars&quot; by drag queen Jaida Essence Hall.

<doc id="89712" wikidata="Q6053966" url="?curid=89712" title="International Tin Council">
<text>The International Tin Council (ITC) was an organisation which acted on behalf of major tin producers and consumers to control the international tin market.

An &quot;International Tin Study Group&quot;, which was established in 1947 to survey world supply of and demand for tin, led to the treaty, the International Tin Agreement, signed in 1954, and the formation of the ITC in 1956.

The objectives were:
* Prevent or alleviate widespread unemployment or under-employment and other serious difficulties which are likely to result from maladjustments between the supply of and the demand for tin.
* Prevent excessive fluctuations in the price of tin and achieve a reasonable degree of stability of price on a basis which will secure long-term equilibrium between supply and demand.
* Ensure adequate supplies of tin at reasonable prices at all times.
* Provide a framework for the consideration and development of measures to promote the progressively more economic production of tin while protecting tin deposits from unnecessary waste or premature abandonment.

The original consumer members were:
* Australia
* Brazil
* Belgium
* Canada
* Denmark
* Ecuador
* France
* Federal Republic of Germany
* India
* Italy
* Japan
* Lebanon
* Netherlands
* Switzerland
* Spain
* Turkey
* United Kingdom
* United States

The original producer members were:
* Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi
* Bolivia 
* Indonesia
* Malaysia
* Nigeria 
* Thailand

After the 1954 agreement, another agreement was signed every five years, in 1960, 1965, 1970, 1975, and 1980.

By the sixth agreement, established at the United Nations Tin Conference, 1980, new consumers included Finland, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden. New producers were Australia, Brazil and Zaire.

At various times Guinea, Mexico, Republic of Korea, the United Arab Republic, Israel, Liberia, Panama, Yugoslavia, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Poland, the Philippines, Czechoslovakia, Taiwan, Romania, Nicaragua, German Democratic Republic, and Austria held membership.

With the advent of aluminium containers, the use of protective polymer lacquers inside cans, and increased recycling by industry, the demand for tin decreased considerably by the early 1980s, and in October 1985 the ITC could no longer maintain the price. It eventually ran out of money buying up tin on the metals markets. Attempts to refinance the ITC were eventually abandoned, and since then, as with many other raw materials, the price has generally declined as alternatives become more attractive.

==Association of Tin Producing Countries==
In 1984 an &quot;Association of Tin Producing Countries&quot; was created with members: Australia, Bolivia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, and Zaire. It ceased to exist in 2001.

<doc id="89722" wikidata="Q5885047" url="?curid=89722" title="Quetzal">
<text>Quetzals () are strikingly colored birds in the trogon family. They are found in forests, especially in humid highlands, with the five species from the genus &quot;Pharomachrus&quot; being exclusively Neotropical, while a single species, the eared quetzal, &quot;Euptilotis neoxenus&quot;, is found in Guatemala, sometimes in Mexico and very locally in the southernmost United States. In the highlands of the states of Sonora, Chihuahua, Sinaloa, Durango, Nayarit, Zacatecas, Jalisco, and Michoacán, the eared quetzal can be found from northwest to west-central Mexico. It is a Mesoamerican indigenous species, but some reports show that it occasionally travels and nests in southeastern Arizona and New Mexico in the United States. June to October is the mating season for eared quetzals. Quetzals are fairly large (all over long), slightly bigger than other trogon species. The resplendent quetzal is the national bird of Guatemala because of its vibrant colour and cultural significance to the Maya.

== Physical attributes ==
Quetzals have iridescent green or golden-green wing coverts, back, chest and head, with a red belly. Their wings are suited to camouflage under rainy conditions, because their feathers blend well with wet and shiny green area. They are strongly sexually dimorphic, and parts of the females&#x27; plumage are brown or grey. The tails of the male quetzals may take up to three years after reaching maturity to grow to the maximum length. These largely solitary birds feed on fruits, berries, insects and small vertebrates (such as frogs). Even with their famous bright plumage, they can be hard to see in their natural wooded habitats.

==Conservation status==
None of the many quetzal species are under immediate threat in the wild, although the eared and resplendent quetzal are at the Near Threatened status. &quot;Pharomachrus mocinno&quot; is dependent on standing dead and mature trees for breeding holes, which are only formed in primary cloud forest; the species&#x27; breeding behavior is linked to the long term existence of these forests such as the few remaining in highland Guatemala. The remaining are not considered threatened by the IUCN and all are locally common. Among the most concentrated populations are the Baja Verapaz part of the Sierra de las Minas and the Chicabnab Reserve of Alta Verapaz. However, it should be kept in mind while despite the fact that quetzals typically inhabit cloud forests, the fact that they are being divided into much smaller patches is what is known as a principal threat to their survival. Another major threat to these animals is poaching. Since their feathers are still seen as an artifact poachers use their feather as trade to foreign tourists and museum collectors, but also are used for medicines and rituals. Deforestation is eliminating their natural habitat causing them to relocate to other areas. Resplendent Quetzals are known to relocate in lower elevated areas during the summertime when precipitation is known to increase, their patterns in movement are most likely correlated to a surplus of ripe Lauraceae fruits.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;quetzal&quot; is from Nahuatl , &quot;large brilliant tail feather&quot; (&quot;American Audubon Dictionary&quot;) or &quot;tail coverts of the quetzal&quot; (&quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Collegiate Dictionary&quot;), from the Nahuatl root = &quot;stand up&quot; used to refer to an upstanding plume of feathers. The word entered English through Spanish. The quetzal plays a central role in Mesoamerican mythology and is associated with the Aztec deity Quetzalcoatl.

The word &quot;quetzal&quot; was originally used for just the resplendent quetzal, the long-tailed quetzal of Guatemala, (more specifically the area of Northern Guatemala known as the Petén) which is the national bird and the name of the currency of Guatemala. It still often refers to that bird specifically but now also names all the species of the genera &quot;Pharomachrus&quot; and &quot;Euptilotis&quot;.

&quot;Pharomachrus&quot; is from Ancient Greek , &quot;mantle&quot;, and , &quot;long&quot;, referring to the wing and tail coverts of the resplendent quetzal (the second &quot;h&quot; is unexplained).

The quetzal is also known in Peru as the .

== Cultural significance ==
The Quetzal has long been significantly important for the ancient Maya and Aztecs. Their feathers were considered luxury goods to represent high status and are often seen in the headdresses of the emperors and other costume elements.

<text>Elizabeth R is a BBC television drama serial of six 90-minute plays starring Glenda Jackson as Queen Elizabeth I of England. It was first broadcast on BBC2 from February to March 1971, through the ABC in Australia and broadcast in the United States on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;. The series has been repeated several times, most recently from 15 March 2023, by BBC Four.

==Production==
&quot;Elizabeth R&quot; was filmed at a variety of locations including Penshurst Place which doubled as the queen&#x27;s castle grounds and Chiddingstone in Kent, though all the interiors were recorded at the BBC Television Centre.

The first episode was broadcast on 17 February 1971, beginning on screen with the year 1549 as the setting, with the then Princess Elizabeth&#x27;s difficult ascent to the throne of England nine years later. The final episode was shown on 24 March 1971, the 368th anniversary of the Queen&#x27;s death on March 24, 1603. It was repeated almost immediately in response to audience demand.

The series followed the successful &quot;Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; (1970), with several performers reprising their roles in &quot;Elizabeth R&quot; (all in the first episode) from the earlier series, notably John Ronane as Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley, Bernard Hepton as Cranmer, Basil Dignam as Bishop Gardiner and Rosalie Crutchley as Catherine Parr.

In February 1972, &quot;Elizabeth R&quot; first aired in the United States on &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;, then hosted by Alistair Cooke on PBS. In the summer of 1972, it was rebroadcast with commercials on the New York City independent station WOR-TV Channel 9.

Glenda Jackson&#x27;s performance in the title role won her two Emmy Awards—for Best Actress in a Drama Series and Best Actress in a Movie/TV Special (for the episode &quot;Shadow in the Sun&quot;). The series itself won the Emmy for the Best Dramatic Series in 1972 (the first British TV series ever to win the American TV award, before &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; carried the award two years later). At around the same time, Jackson also played the part of Elizabeth in the film &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; (1971).

Costume designer Elizabeth Waller won an Emmy for her designs; she recreated many of the historical Elizabeth&#x27;s actual gowns, adapting them from a number of the Queen&#x27;s official portraits. They later went on display at Hampton Court Palace.

&quot;Elizabeth R&quot; featured many well-known British actors, including Malcolm McFee, Michael Williams, Margaretta Scott, John Woodvine, James Laurenson, Angela Thorne, Brian Wilde, Robin Ellis, Robert Hardy and Peter Egan.

The series was parodied in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; in an absurdist sketch where a Japanese film director, disguised unconvincingly as Luchino Visconti, forces his cast to perform as Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s court while sitting on motor-scooters and speaking Engrish. Therefore, the title was changed to &quot;Erizabeth L&quot;.

&quot;Elizabeth R&quot; was first released for DVD Region 1 during 2001 by BBC Warner and then re-released by BBC Worldwide in 2011. In DVD Region 2, it was issued by 2 Entertain in 2006.

<text>Akhenaten (pronounced ), also spelled Akhenaton or Echnaton ( &quot;ʾŪḫə-nə-yātəy&quot;, , meaning &#x27;Effective for the Aten&#x27;), was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh reigning or 1351–1334 BC, the tenth ruler of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Before the fifth year of his reign, he was known as Amenhotep IV (, meaning &quot;Amun is satisfied&quot;, Hellenized as &quot;Amenophis IV&quot;).

As a pharaoh, Akhenaten is noted for abandoning traditional ancient Egyptian religion of polytheism and introducing Atenism, or worship centered around Aten. The views of Egyptologists differ as to whether the religious policy was absolutely monotheistic, or whether it was monolatristic, syncretistic, or henotheistic. This culture shift away from traditional religion was reversed after his death. Akhenaten&#x27;s monuments were dismantled and hidden, his statues were destroyed, and his name excluded from lists of rulers compiled by later pharaohs. Traditional religious practice was gradually restored, notably under his close successor Tutankhamun, who changed his name from Tutankhaten early in his reign. When some dozen years later, rulers without clear rights of succession from the Eighteenth Dynasty founded a new dynasty, they discredited Akhenaten and his immediate successors and referred to Akhenaten as &quot;the enemy&quot; or &quot;that criminal&quot; in archival records.

Akhenaten was all but lost to history until the late-19th-century discovery of Amarna, or Akhetaten, the new capital city he built for the worship of Aten. Furthermore, in 1907, a mummy that could be Akhenaten&#x27;s was unearthed from the tomb KV55 in the Valley of the Kings by Edward R. Ayrton. Genetic testing has determined that the man buried in KV55 was Tutankhamun&#x27;s father, but its identification as Akhenaten has since been questioned.

Akhenaten&#x27;s rediscovery and Flinders Petrie&#x27;s early excavations at Amarna sparked great public interest in the pharaoh and his queen Nefertiti. He has been described as &quot;enigmatic&quot;, &quot;mysterious&quot;, &quot;revolutionary&quot;, &quot;the greatest idealist of the world&quot;, and &quot;the first individual in history&quot;, but also as a &quot;heretic&quot;, &quot;fanatic&quot;, &quot;possibly insane&quot;, and &quot;mad&quot;. Public and scholarly fascination with Akhenaten comes from his connection with Tutankhamun, the unique style and high quality of the pictorial arts he patronized, and the religion he attempted to establish, foreshadowing monotheism.

== Family ==


The future Akhenaten was born Amenhotep, a younger son of pharaoh Amenhotep III and his principal wife Tiye. Akhenaten had an elder brother, crown prince Thutmose, who was recognized as Amenhotep III&#x27;s heir. Akhenaten also had four or five sisters: Sitamun, Henuttaneb, Iset, Nebetah, and possibly Beketaten. Thutmose&#x27;s early death, perhaps around Amenhotep III&#x27;s thirtieth regnal year, meant that Akhenaten was next in line for Egypt&#x27;s throne.

Akhenaten was married to Nefertiti, his Great Royal Wife. The exact timing of their marriage is unknown, but inscriptions from the pharaoh&#x27;s building projects suggest that they married either shortly before or after Akhenaten took the throne. For example, Egyptologist Dimitri Laboury suggests that the marriage took place in Akhenaten&#x27;s fourth regnal year. A secondary wife of Akhenaten named Kiya is also known from inscriptions. Some Egyptologists theorize that she gained her importance as the mother of Tutankhamun. William Murnane proposes that Kiya is the colloquial name of the Mitanni princess Tadukhipa, daughter of the Mitanni king Tushratta who had married Amenhotep III before becoming the wife of Akhenaten. Akhenaten&#x27;s other attested consorts are the daughter of the Enišasi ruler Šatiya and another daughter of the Babylonian king Burna-Buriash II.

Akhenaten could have had seven or eight children based on inscriptions. Egyptologists are fairly certain about his six daughters, who are well attested in contemporary depictions. Among his six daughters, Meritaten was born in regnal year one or five; Meketaten in year four or six; Ankhesenpaaten, later queen of Tutankhamun, before year five or eight; Neferneferuaten Tasherit in year eight or nine; Neferneferure in year nine or ten; and Setepenre in year ten or eleven. Tutankhamun, born Tutankhaten, was most likely Akhenaten&#x27;s son, with Nefertiti or another wife. There is less certainty around Akhenaten&#x27;s relationship with Smenkhkare, Akhenaten&#x27;s coregent or successor and husband to his daughter Meritaten; he could have been Akhenaten&#x27;s eldest son with an unknown wife or Akhenaten&#x27;s younger brother.

Some historians, such as Edward Wente and James Allen, have proposed that Akhenaten took some of his daughters as wives or sexual consorts to father a male heir. While this is debated, some historical parallels exist: Akhenaten&#x27;s father Amenhotep III married his daughter Sitamun, while Ramesses II married two or more of his daughters, even though their marriages might simply have been ceremonial. In Akhenaten&#x27;s case, his oldest daughter Meritaten is recorded as Great Royal Wife to Smenkhkare but is also listed on a box from Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb alongside pharaohs Akhenaten and Neferneferuaten as Great Royal Wife. Additionally, letters written to Akhenaten from foreign rulers make reference to Meritaten as &quot;mistress of the house&quot;. Egyptologists in the early 20th century also believed that Akhenaten could have fathered a child with his second oldest daughter Meketaten. Meketaten&#x27;s death, at perhaps age ten to twelve, is recorded in the royal tombs at Akhetaten from around regnal years thirteen or fourteen. Early Egyptologists attribute her death to childbirth, because of the depiction of an infant in her tomb. Because no husband is known for Meketaten, the assumption had been that Akhenaten was the father. Aidan Dodson believes this to be unlikely, as no Egyptian tomb has been found that mentions or alludes to the cause of death of the tomb owner. Further, Jacobus van Dijk proposes that the child is a portrayal of Meketaten&#x27;s soul. Finally, various monuments, originally for Kiya, were reinscribed for Akhenaten&#x27;s daughters Meritaten and Ankhesenpaaten. The revised inscriptions list a Meritaten-tasherit (&quot;junior&quot;) and an Ankhesenpaaten-tasherit. According to some, this indicates that Akhenaten fathered his own grandchildren. Others hold that, since these grandchildren are not attested to elsewhere, they are fictions invented to fill the space originally portraying Kiya&#x27;s child.

== Early life ==

Egyptologists know very little about Akhenaten&#x27;s life as prince Amenhotep. Donald B. Redford dates his birth before his father Amenhotep III&#x27;s 25th regnal year, , based on the birth of Akhenaten&#x27;s first daughter, who was likely born fairly early in his own reign. The only mention of his name, as &quot;the King&#x27;s Son Amenhotep&quot;, was found on a wine docket at Amenhotep III&#x27;s Malkata palace, where some historians suggested Akhenaten was born. Others contend that he was born at Memphis, where growing up he was influenced by the worship of the sun god Ra practiced at nearby Heliopolis. Redford and James K. Hoffmeier state, however, that Ra&#x27;s cult was so widespread and established throughout Egypt that Akhenaten could have been influenced by solar worship even if he did not grow up around Heliopolis.

Some historians have tried to determine who was Akhenaten&#x27;s tutor during his youth, and have proposed scribes Heqareshu or Meryre II, the royal tutor Amenemotep, or the vizier Aperel. The only person who we know for certain served the prince was Parennefer, whose tomb mentions this fact.

Egyptologist Cyril Aldred suggests that prince Amenhotep might have been a High Priest of Ptah in Memphis, although no evidence supporting this had been found. It is known that Amenhotep&#x27;s brother, crown prince Thutmose, served in this role before he died. If Amenhotep inherited all his brother&#x27;s roles in preparation for his accession to the throne, he might have become a high priest in Thutmose&#x27;s stead. Aldred proposes that Akhenaten&#x27;s unusual artistic inclinations might have been formed during his time serving Ptah, the patron god of craftsmen, whose high priests were sometimes referred to as &quot;The Greatest of the Directors of Craftsmanship&quot;.

== Reign ==
=== Coregency with Amenhotep III ===

There is much controversy around whether Amenhotep IV ascended to Egypt&#x27;s throne on the death of his father Amenhotep III or whether there was a coregency, lasting perhaps as long as 12 years. Eric Cline, Nicholas Reeves, Peter Dorman, and other scholars argue strongly against the establishment of a long coregency between the two rulers and in favor of either no coregency or one lasting at most two years. Donald B. Redford, William J. Murnane, Alan Gardiner, and Lawrence Berman contest the view of any coregency whatsoever between Akhenaten and his father.

Most recently, in 2014, archaeologists found both pharaohs&#x27; names inscribed on the wall of the Luxor tomb of vizier Amenhotep-Huy. The Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities called this &quot;conclusive evidence&quot; that Akhenaten shared power with his father for at least eight years, based on the dating of the tomb. However, this conclusion has since been called into question by other Egyptologists, according to whom the inscription only means that construction on Amenhotep-Huy&#x27;s tomb started during Amenhotep III&#x27;s reign and ended under Akhenaten&#x27;s, and Amenhotep-Huy thus simply wanted to pay his respects to both rulers.

=== Early reign as Amenhotep lV ===

Akhenaten took Egypt&#x27;s throne as Amenhotep IV, most likely in 1353 or 1351 BC. It is unknown how old Amenhotep IV was when he did this; estimates range from 10 to 23. He was most likely crowned in Thebes, or less likely at Memphis or Armant.

The beginning of Amenhotep IV&#x27;s reign followed established pharaonic traditions. He did not immediately start redirecting worship toward the Aten and distancing himself from other gods. Egyptologist Donald B. Redford believes this implied that Amenhotep IV&#x27;s eventual religious policies were not conceived of before his reign, and he did not follow a pre-established plan or program. Redford points to three pieces of evidence to support this. First, surviving inscriptions show Amenhotep IV worshipping several different gods, including Atum, Osiris, Anubis, Nekhbet, Hathor, and the Eye of Ra, and texts from this era refer to &quot;the gods&quot; and &quot;every god and every goddess&quot;. The High Priest of Amun was also still active in the fourth year of Amenhotep IV&#x27;s reign. Second, even though he later moved his capital from Thebes to Akhetaten, his initial royal titulary honored Thebes—his nomen was &quot;Amenhotep, god-ruler of Thebes&quot;—and recognizing its importance, he called the city &quot;Southern Heliopolis, the first great (seat) of Re (or) the Disc&quot;. Third, Amenhotep IV did not yet destroy temples to the other gods and he even continued his father&#x27;s construction projects at Karnak&#x27;s Precinct of Amun-Re. He decorated the walls of the precinct&#x27;s Third Pylon with images of himself worshipping Ra-Horakhty, portrayed in the god&#x27;s traditional form of a falcon-headed man.

Artistic depictions continued unchanged early in Amenhotep IV&#x27;s reign. Tombs built or completed in the first few years after he took the throne, such as those of Kheruef, Ramose, and Parennefer, show the pharaoh in the traditional artistic style. In Ramose&#x27;s tomb, Amenhotep IV appears on the west wall, seated on a throne, with Ramose appearing before the pharaoh. On the other side of the doorway, Amenhotep IV and Nefertiti are shown in the window of appearances, with the Aten depicted as the sun disc. In Parennefer&#x27;s tomb, Amenhotep IV and Nefertiti are seated on a throne with the sun disc depicted over the pharaoh and his queen.

While continuing the worship of other gods, Amenhotep IV&#x27;s initial building program sought to build new places of worship to the Aten. He ordered the construction of temples or shrines to the Aten in several cities across the country, such as Bubastis, Tell el-Borg, Heliopolis, Memphis, Nekhen, Kawa, and Kerma. He also ordered the construction of a large temple complex dedicated to the Aten at Karnak in Thebes, northeast of the parts of the Karnak complex dedicated to Amun. The Aten temple complex, collectively known as the Per Aten (&quot;House of the Aten&quot;), consisted of several temples whose names survive: the Gempaaten (&quot;The Aten is found in the estate of the Aten&quot;), the Hwt Benben (&quot;House or Temple of the Benben&quot;), the Rud-Menu (&quot;Enduring of monuments for Aten forever&quot;), the Teni-Menu (&quot;Exalted are the monuments of the Aten forever&quot;), and the Sekhen Aten (&quot;booth of Aten&quot;).

Around regnal year two or three, Amenhotep IV organized a Sed festival. Sed festivals were ritual rejuvenations of an aging pharaoh, which usually took place for the first time around the thirtieth year of a pharaoh&#x27;s reign and every three or so years thereafter. Egyptologists only speculate as to why Amenhotep IV organized a Sed festival when he was likely still in his early twenties. Some historians see it as evidence for Amenhotep III and Amenhotep IV&#x27;s coregency, and believed that Amenhotep IV&#x27;s Sed festival coincided with one of his father&#x27;s celebrations. Others speculate that Amenhotep IV chose to hold his festival three years after his father&#x27;s death, aiming to proclaim his rule a continuation of his father&#x27;s reign. Yet others believe that the festival was held to honor the Aten on whose behalf the pharaoh ruled Egypt, or, as Amenhotep III was considered to have become one with the Aten following his death, the Sed festival honored both the pharaoh and the god at the same time. It is also possible that the purpose of the ceremony was to figuratively fill Amenhotep IV with strength before his great enterprise: the introduction of the Aten cult and the founding of the new capital Akhetaten. Regardless of the celebration&#x27;s aim, Egyptologists believe that during the festivities Amenhotep IV only made offerings to the Aten rather than the many gods and goddesses, as was customary.

=== Name change ===

Among the last documents that refer to Akhenaten as Amenhotep IV are two copies of a letter to the pharaoh from Ipy, the high steward of Memphis. These letters, found at Gurob, informing the pharaoh that the royal estates in Memphis are &quot;in good order&quot; and the temple of Ptah is &quot;prosperous and flourishing&quot;, are dated to regnal year five, day nineteen of the growing season&#x27;s third month. About a month later, day thirteen of the growing season&#x27;s fourth month, one of the boundary stela at Akhetaten already had the name Akhenaten carved on it, implying that the pharaoh changed his name between the two inscriptions.

Amenhotep IV changed his royal titulary to show his devotion to the Aten. No longer would he be known as Amenhotep IV and be associated with the god Amun, but rather he would completely shift his focus to the Aten. Egyptologists debate the exact meaning of Akhenaten, his new personal name. The word &quot;akh&quot; () could have different translations, such as &quot;satisfied&quot;, &quot;effective spirit&quot;, or &quot;serviceable to&quot;, and thus Akhenaten&#x27;s name could be translated to mean &quot;Aten is satisfied&quot;, &quot;Effective spirit of the Aten&quot;, or &quot;Serviceable to the Aten&quot;, respectively. Gertie Englund and Florence Friedman arrive at the translation &quot;Effective for the Aten&quot; by analyzing contemporary texts and inscriptions, in which Akhenaten often described himself as being &quot;effective for&quot; the sun disc. Englund and Friedman conclude that the frequency with which Akhenaten used this term likely means that his own name meant &quot;Effective for the Aten&quot;.

Some historians, such as William F. Albright, Edel Elmar, and Gerhard Fecht, propose that Akhenaten&#x27;s name is misspelled and mispronounced. These historians believe &quot;Aten&quot; should rather be &quot;Jāti&quot;, thus rendering the pharaoh&#x27;s name Akhenjāti or Aḫanjāti (pronounced ), as it could have been pronounced in Ancient Egypt.

=== Founding Amarna ===

Around the same time he changed his royal titulary, on the thirteenth day of the growing season&#x27;s fourth month, Akhenaten decreed that a new capital city be built: Akhetaten (, meaning &quot;Horizon of the Aten&quot;), better known today as Amarna. The events Egyptologists know the most about during Akhenaten&#x27;s life are connected with founding Akhetaten, as several so-called boundary stelae were found around the city to mark its boundary. The pharaoh chose a site about halfway between Thebes, the capital at the time, and Memphis, on the east bank of the Nile, where a wadi and a natural dip in the surrounding cliffs form a silhouette similar to the &quot;horizon&quot; hieroglyph. Additionally, the site had previously been uninhabited. According to inscriptions on one boundary stela, the site was appropriate for Aten&#x27;s city for &quot;not being the property of a god, nor being the property of a goddess, nor being the property of a ruler, nor being the property of a female ruler, nor being the property of any people able to lay claim to it.&quot;

Historians do not know for certain why Akhenaten established a new capital and left Thebes, the old capital. The boundary stelae detailing Akhetaten&#x27;s founding is damaged where it likely explained the pharaoh&#x27;s motives for the move. Surviving parts claim what happened to Akhenaten was &quot;worse than those that I heard&quot; previously in his reign and worse than those &quot;heard by any kings who assumed the White Crown&quot;, and alludes to &quot;offensive&quot; speech against the Aten. Egyptologists believe that Akhenaten could be referring to conflict with the priesthood and followers of Amun, the patron god of Thebes. The great temples of Amun, such as Karnak, were all located in Thebes and the priests there achieved significant power earlier in the Eighteenth Dynasty, especially under Hatshepsut and Thutmose III, thanks to pharaohs offering large amounts of Egypt&#x27;s growing wealth to the cult of Amun; historians, such as Donald B. Redford, therefore posited that by moving to a new capital, Akhenaten may have been trying to break with Amun&#x27;s priests and the god.

Akhetaten was a planned city with the Great Temple of the Aten, Small Aten Temple, royal residences, records office, and government buildings in the city center. Some of these buildings, such as the Aten temples, were ordered to be built by Akhenaten on the boundary stela decreeing the city&#x27;s founding.

The city was built quickly, thanks to a new construction method that used substantially smaller building blocks than under previous pharaohs. These blocks, called talatats, measured by by 1 ancient Egyptian cubits (), and because of the smaller weight and standardized size, using them during constructions was more efficient than using heavy building blocks of varying sizes. By regnal year eight, Akhetaten reached a state where it could be occupied by the royal family. Only his most loyal subjects followed Akhenaten and his family to the new city. While the city continued to be built, in years five through eight, construction work began to stop in Thebes. The Theban Aten temples that had begun were abandoned, and a village of those working on Valley of the Kings tombs was relocated to the workers&#x27; village at Akhetaten. However, construction work continued in the rest of the country, as larger cult centers, such as Heliopolis and Memphis, also had temples built for Aten.

=== International relations ===


The Amarna letters have provided important evidence about Akhenaten&#x27;s reign and foreign policy. The letters are a cache of 382 diplomatic texts and literary and educational materials discovered between 1887 and 1979, and named after Amarna, the modern name for Akhenaten&#x27;s capital Akhetaten. The diplomatic correspondence comprises clay tablet messages between Amenhotep III, Akhenaten, and Tutankhamun, various subjects through Egyptian military outposts, rulers of vassal states, and the foreign rulers of Babylonia, Assyria, Syria, Canaan, Alashiya, Arzawa, Mitanni, and the Hittites.

The Amarna letters portray the international situation in the Eastern Mediterranean that Akhenaten inherited from his predecessors. In the 200 years preceding Akhenaten&#x27;s reign, following the expulsion of the Hyksos from Lower Egypt at the end of the Second Intermediate Period, the kingdom&#x27;s influence and military might increased greatly. Egypt&#x27;s power reached new heights under Thutmose III, who ruled approximately 100 years before Akhenaten and led several successful military campaigns into Nubia and Syria. Egypt&#x27;s expansion led to confrontation with the Mitanni, but this rivalry ended with the two nations becoming allies. Slowly, however, Egypt&#x27;s power started to wane. Amenhotep III aimed to maintain the balance of power through marriages—such as his marriage to Tadukhipa, daughter of the Mitanni king Tushratta—and vassal states. Under Amenhotep III and Akhenaten, Egypt was unable or unwilling to oppose the rise of the Hittites around Syria. The pharaohs seemed to eschew military confrontation at a time when the balance of power between Egypt&#x27;s neighbors and rivals was shifting, and the Hittites, a confrontational state, overtook the Mitanni in influence.

Early in his reign, Akhenaten was evidently concerned about the expanding power of the Hittite Empire under Šuppiluliuma I. A successful Hittite attack on Mitanni and its ruler Tushratta would have disrupted the entire international balance of power in the Ancient Middle East at a time when Egypt had made peace with Mitanni; this would cause some of Egypt&#x27;s vassals to switch their allegiances to the Hittites, as time would prove. A group of Egypt&#x27;s allies who attempted to rebel against the Hittites were captured, and wrote letters begging Akhenaten for troops, but he did not respond to most of their pleas. Evidence suggests that the troubles on the northern frontier led to difficulties in Canaan, particularly in a struggle for power between Labaya of Shechem and Abdi-Heba of Jerusalem, which required the pharaoh to intervene in the area by dispatching Medjay troops northwards. Akhenaten pointedly refused to save his vassal Rib-Hadda of Byblos—whose kingdom was being besieged by the expanding state of Amurru under Abdi-Ashirta and later Aziru, son of Abdi-Ashirta—despite Rib-Hadda&#x27;s numerous pleas for help from the pharaoh. Rib-Hadda wrote a total of 60 letters to Akhenaten pleading for aid from the pharaoh. Akhenaten wearied of Rib-Hadda&#x27;s constant correspondences and once told Rib-Hadda: &quot;You are the one that writes to me more than all the (other) mayors&quot; or Egyptian vassals in EA 124. What Rib-Hadda did not comprehend was that the Egyptian king would not organize and dispatch an entire army north just to preserve the political status quo of several minor city states on the fringes of Egypt&#x27;s Asiatic Empire. Rib-Hadda would pay the ultimate price; his exile from Byblos due to a coup led by his brother Ilirabih is mentioned in one letter. When Rib-Hadda appealed in vain for aid from Akhenaten and then turned to Aziru, his sworn enemy, to place him back on the throne of his city, Aziru promptly had him dispatched to the king of Sidon, where Rib-Hadda was almost certainly executed.

In a view discounted by the 21st century, several Egyptologists in the late 19th and 20th centuries interpreted the Amarna letters to mean that Akhenaten was a pacifist who neglected foreign policy and Egypt&#x27;s foreign territories in favor of his internal reforms. For example, Henry Hall believed Akhenaten &quot;succeeded by his obstinate doctrinaire love of peace in causing far more misery in his world than half a dozen elderly militarists could have done,&quot; while James Henry Breasted said Akhenaten &quot;was not fit to cope with a situation demanding an aggressive man of affairs and a skilled military leader.&quot; Others noted that the Amarna letters counter the conventional view that Akhenaten neglected Egypt&#x27;s foreign territories in favour of his internal reforms. For instance, Norman de Garis Davies praised Akhenaten&#x27;s emphasis on diplomacy over war, while James Baikie said that the fact &quot;that there is no evidence of revolt within the borders of Egypt itself during the whole reign is surely ample proof that there was no such abandonment of his royal duties on the part of Akhenaten as has been assumed.&quot; Indeed, several letters from Egyptian vassals notified the pharaoh that they have followed his instructions, implying that the pharaoh sent such instructions. The Amarna letters also show that vassal states were told repeatedly to expect the arrival of the Egyptian military on their lands, and provide evidence that these troops were dispatched and arrived at their destination. Dozens of letters detail that Akhenaten—and Amenhotep III—sent Egyptian and Nubian troops, armies, archers, chariots, horses, and ships.

Only one military campaign is known for certain under Akhenaten&#x27;s reign. In his second or twelfth year, Akhenaten ordered his Viceroy of Kush Tuthmose to lead a military expedition to quell a rebellion and raids on settlements on the Nile by Nubian nomadic tribes. The victory was commemorated on two stelae, one discovered at Amada and another at Buhen. Egyptologists differ on the size of the campaign: Wolfgang Helck considered it a small-scale police operation, while Alan Schulman considered it a &quot;war of major proportions&quot;.

Other Egyptologists suggested that Akhenaten could have waged war in Syria or the Levant, possibly against the Hittites. Cyril Aldred, based on Amarna letters describing Egyptian troop movements, proposed that Akhenaten launched an unsuccessful war around the city of Gezer, while Marc Gabolde argued for an unsuccessful campaign around Kadesh. Either of these could be the campaign referred to on Tutankhamun&#x27;s Restoration Stela: &quot;if an army was sent to Djahy [southern Canaan and Syria] to broaden the boundaries of Egypt, no success of their cause came to pass.&quot; John Coleman Darnell and Colleen Manassa also argued that Akhenaten fought with the Hittites for control of Kadesh, but was unsuccessful; the city was not recaptured until 60–70 years later, under Seti I.

Overall, archeological evidence suggests that Akhenaten paid close attention to the affairs of Egyptian vassals in Canaan and Syria, though primarily not through letters such as those found at Amarna but through reports from government officials and agents. Akhenaten managed to preserve Egypt&#x27;s control over the core of its Near Eastern Empire (which consisted of present-day Israel as well as the Phoenician coast) while avoiding conflict with the increasingly powerful and aggressive Hittite Empire of Šuppiluliuma I, which overtook the Mitanni as the dominant power in the northern part of the region. Only the Egyptian border province of Amurru in Syria around the Orontes River was lost to the Hittites when its ruler Aziru defected to the Hittites; ordered by Akhenaten to come to Egypt, Aziru was released after promising to stay loyal to the pharaoh, nonetheless turning to the Hittites soon after his release.

=== Later years ===

Egyptologists know little about the last five years of Akhenaten&#x27;s reign, beginning in These years are poorly attested and only a few pieces of contemporary evidence survive; the lack of clarity makes reconstructing the latter part of the pharaoh&#x27;s reign &quot;a daunting task&quot; and a controversial and contested topic of discussion among Egyptologists. 

Among the newest pieces of evidence is an inscription discovered in 2012 at a limestone quarry in Deir el-Bersha, just north of Akhetaten, from the pharaoh&#x27;s sixteenth regnal year. The text refers to a building project in Amarna and establishes that Akhenaten and Nefertiti were still a royal couple just a year before Akhenaten&#x27;s death. The inscription is dated to Year 16, month 3 of Akhet, day 15 of the reign of Akhenaten.

Before the 2012 discovery of the Deir el-Bersha inscription, the last known fixed-date event in Akhenaten&#x27;s reign was a royal reception in regnal year twelve, in which the pharaoh and the royal family received tributes and offerings from allied countries and vassal states at Akhetaten. Inscriptions show tributes from Nubia, the Land of Punt, Syria, the Kingdom of Hattusa, the islands in the Mediterranean Sea, and Libya. Egyptologists, such as Aidan Dodson, consider this year twelve celebration to be the zenith of Akhenaten&#x27;s reign. Thanks to reliefs in the tomb of courtier Meryre II, historians know that the royal family, Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and their six daughters, were present at the royal reception in full. However, historians are uncertain about the reasons for the reception. Possibilities include the celebration of the marriage of future pharaoh Ay to Tey, celebration of Akhenaten&#x27;s twelve years on the throne, the summons of king Aziru of Amurru to Egypt, a military victory at Sumur in the Levant, a successful military campaign in Nubia, Nefertiti&#x27;s ascendancy to the throne as coregent, or the completion of the new capital city Akhetaten.

Following year twelve, Donald B. Redford and other Egyptologists proposed that Egypt was struck by an epidemic, most likely a plague. Contemporary evidence suggests that a plague ravaged through the Middle East around this time, and ambassadors and delegations arriving to Akhenaten&#x27;s year twelve reception might have brought the disease to Egypt. Alternatively, letters from the Hattians might suggest that the epidemic originated in Egypt and was carried throughout the Middle East by Egyptian prisoners of war. Regardless of its origin, the epidemic might account for several deaths in the royal family that occurred in the last five years of Akhenaten&#x27;s reign, including those of his daughters Meketaten, Neferneferure, and Setepenre.

=== Coregency with Smenkhkare or Nefertiti ===

Akhenaten could have ruled together with Smenkhkare and Nefertiti for several years before his death. Based on depictions and artifacts from the tombs of Meryre II and Tutankhamun, Smenkhkare could have been Akhenaten&#x27;s coregent by regnal year thirteen or fourteen, but died a year or two later. Nefertiti might not have assumed the role of coregent until after year sixteen, when a stela still mentions her as Akhenaten&#x27;s Great Royal Wife. While Nefertiti&#x27;s familial relationship with Akhenaten is known, whether Akhenaten and Smenkhkare were related by blood is unclear. Smenkhkare could have been Akhenaten&#x27;s son or brother, as the son of Amenhotep III with Tiye or Sitamun. Archaeological evidence makes it clear, however, that Smenkhkare was married to Meritaten, Akhenaten&#x27;s eldest daughter. For another, the so-called Coregency Stela, found in a tomb at Akhetaten, might show queen Nefertiti as Akhenaten&#x27;s coregent, but this is uncertain as the stela was recarved to show the names of Ankhesenpaaten and Neferneferuaten. Egyptologist Aidan Dodson proposed that both Smenkhkare and Neferiti were Akhenaten&#x27;s coregents to ensure the Amarna family&#x27;s continued rule when Egypt was confronted with an epidemic. Dodson suggested that the two were chosen to rule as Tutankhaten&#x27;s coregent in case Akhenaten died and Tutankhaten took the throne at a young age, or rule in Tutankhaten&#x27;s stead if the prince also died in the epidemic.

=== Death and burial ===


Akhenaten died after seventeen years of rule and was initially buried in a tomb in the Royal Wadi east of Akhetaten. The order to construct the tomb and to bury the pharaoh there was commemorated on one of the boundary stela delineating the capital&#x27;s borders: &quot;Let a tomb be made for me in the eastern mountain [of Akhetaten]. Let my burial be made in it, in the millions of jubilees which the Aten, my father, decreed for me.&quot; In the years following the burial, Akhenaten&#x27;s sarcophagus was destroyed and left in the Akhetaten necropolis; reconstructed in the 20th century, it is in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo as of 2019. Despite leaving the sarcophagus behind, Akhenaten&#x27;s mummy was removed from the royal tombs after Tutankhamun abandoned Akhetaten and returned to Thebes. It was most likely moved to tomb KV55 in Valley of the Kings near Thebes. This tomb was later desecrated, likely during the Ramesside period.

Whether Smenkhkare also enjoyed a brief independent reign after Akhenaten is unclear. If Smenkhkare outlived Akhenaten, and became sole pharaoh, he likely ruled Egypt for less than a year. The next successor is thought by some to be Nefertiti or Meritaten ruling as Neferneferuaten, reigning in Egypt for about two years. She was, in turn, probably succeeded by Tutankhaten, with the country being administered by the vizier and future pharaoh Ay.
While Akhenaten—perhaps along with Smenkhkare—was most likely reburied in tomb KV55, the identification of the mummy found in that tomb as Akhenaten remains controversial to this day. The mummy has repeatedly been examined since its discovery in 1907. Most recently, Egyptologist Zahi Hawass led a team of researchers to examine the mummy using medical and DNA analysis, with the results published in 2010. In releasing their test results, Hawass&#x27;s team identified the mummy as the father of Tutankhamun and thus &quot;most probably&quot; Akhenaten. However, the study&#x27;s validity has since been called into question. For instance, the discussion of the study results does not discuss that Tutankhamun&#x27;s father and the father&#x27;s siblings would share some genetic markers; if Tutankhamun&#x27;s father was Akhenaten, the DNA results could indicate that the mummy is a brother of Akhenaten, possibly Smenkhkare.

=== Legacy ===

With Akhenaten&#x27;s death, the Aten cult he had founded fell out of favor: at first gradually, and then with decisive finality. Tutankhaten changed his name to Tutankhamun in Year 2 of his reign () and abandoned the city of Akhetaten. Their successors then attempted to erase Akhenaten and his family from the historical record. During the reign of Horemheb, the last pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty and the first pharaoh after Akhenaten who was not related to Akhenaten&#x27;s family, Egyptians started to destroy temples to the Aten and reuse the building blocks in new construction projects, including in temples for the newly restored god Amun. Horemheb&#x27;s successor continued in this effort. Seti I restored monuments to Amun and had the god&#x27;s name re-carved on inscriptions where it was removed by Akhenaten. Seti I also ordered that Akhenaten, Smenkhkare, Neferneferuaten, Tutankhamun, and Ay be excised from official lists of pharaohs to make it appear that Amenhotep III was immediately succeeded by Horemheb. Under the Ramessides, who succeeded Seti I, Akhetaten was gradually destroyed and the building material reused across the country, such as in constructions at Hermopolis. The negative attitudes toward Akhenaten were illustrated by, for example, inscriptions in the tomb of scribe Mose (or Mes), where Akhenaten&#x27;s reign is referred to as &quot;the time of the enemy of Akhet-Aten&quot;.

Some Egyptologists, such as Jacobus van Dijk and Jan Assmann, believe that Akhenaten&#x27;s reign and the Amarna period started a gradual decline in the Egyptian government&#x27;s power and the pharaoh&#x27;s standing in Egyptian&#x27;s society and religious life. Akhenaten&#x27;s religious reforms subverted the relationship ordinary Egyptians had with their gods and their pharaoh, as well as the role the pharaoh played in the relationship between the people and the gods. Before the Amarna period, the pharaoh was the representative of the gods on Earth, the son of the god Ra, and the living incarnation of the god Horus, and maintained the divine order through rituals and offerings and by sustaining the temples of the gods. Additionally, even though the pharaoh oversaw all religious activity, Egyptians could access their gods through regular public holidays, festivals, and processions. This led to a seemingly close connection between people and the gods, especially the patron deity of their respective towns and cities. 

Akhenaten, however, banned the worship of gods beside the Aten, including through festivals. He also declared himself to be the only one who could worship the Aten, and required that all religious devotion previously exhibited toward the gods be directed toward himself. After the Amarna period, during the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties— following Akhenaten&#x27;s death—the relationship between the people, the pharaoh, and the gods did not simply revert to pre-Amarna practices and beliefs. The worship of all gods returned, but the relationship between the gods and the worshipers became more direct and personal, circumventing the pharaoh. Rather than acting through the pharaoh, Egyptians started to believe that the gods intervened directly in their lives, protecting the pious and punishing criminals. The gods replaced the pharaoh as their own representatives on Earth. The god Amun once again became king among all gods. According to van Dijk, &quot;the king was no longer a god, but god himself had become king. Once Amun had been recognized as the true king, the political power of the earthly rulers could be reduced to a minimum.&quot; Consequently, the influence and power of the Amun priesthood continued to grow until the Twenty-first Dynasty, , by which time the High Priests of Amun effectively became rulers over parts of Egypt.

Akhenaten&#x27;s reforms also had a longer-term impact on Ancient Egyptian language and hastened the spread of the spoken Late Egyptian language in official writings and speeches. Spoken and written Egyptian diverged early on in Egyptian history and stayed different over time. During the Amarna period, however, royal and religious texts and inscriptions, including the boundary stelae at Akhetaten or the Amarna letters, started to regularly include more vernacular linguistic elements, such as the definite article or a new possessive form. Even though they continued to diverge, these changes brought the spoken and written language closer to one another more systematically than under previous pharaohs of the New Kingdom. While Akhenaten&#x27;s successors attempted to erase his religious, artistic, and even linguistic changes from history, the new linguistic elements remained a more common part of official texts following the Amarna years, starting with the Nineteenth Dynasty.

Akhenaten is also recognized as a Prophet in the Druze faith.

== Atenism ==


Egyptians worshipped a sun god under several names, and solar worship had been growing in popularity even before Akhenaten, especially during the Eighteenth Dynasty and the reign of Amenhotep III, Akhenaten&#x27;s father. During the New Kingdom, the pharaoh started to be associated with the sun disc; for example, one inscription called the pharaoh Hatshepsut the &quot;female Re shining like the Disc&quot;, while Amenhotep III was described as &quot;he who rises over every foreign land, Nebmare, the dazzling disc&quot;. During the Eighteenth Dynasty, a religious hymn to the sun also appeared and became popular among Egyptians. However, Egyptologists question whether there is a causal relationship between the cult of the sun disc before Akhenaten and Akhenaten&#x27;s religious policies.

=== Implementation and development ===

The implementation of Atenism can be traced through gradual changes in the Aten&#x27;s iconography, and Egyptologist Donald B. Redford divided its development into three stages—earliest, intermediate, and final—in his studies of Akhenaten and Atenism. The earliest stage was associated with a growing number of depictions of the sun disc, though the disc is still seen resting on the head of the falcon-headed sun god Ra-Horakhty, as the god was traditionally represented. The god was only &quot;unique but not exclusive&quot;. The intermediate stage was marked by the elevation of the Aten above other gods and the appearance of cartouches around his inscribed name—cartouches traditionally indicating that the enclosed text is a royal name. The final stage had the Aten represented as a sun disc with sunrays like long arms terminating in human hands and the introduction of a new epithet for the god: &quot;the great living Disc which is in jubilee, lord of heaven and earth&quot;.

In the early years of his reign, Amenhotep IV lived at Thebes, the old capital city, and permitted worship of Egypt&#x27;s traditional deities to continue. However, some signs already pointed to the growing importance of the Aten. For example, inscriptions in the Theban tomb of Parennefer from the early rule of Amenhotep IV state that &quot;one measures the payments to every (other) god with a level measure, but for the Aten one measures so that it overflows,&quot; indicating a more favorable attitude to the cult of Aten than the other gods. Additionally, near the Temple of Karnak, Amun-Ra&#x27;s great cult center, Amenhotep IV erected several massive buildings including temples to the Aten. The new Aten temples had no roof and the god was thus worshipped in the sunlight, under the open sky, rather than in dark temple enclosures as had been the previous custom. The Theban buildings were later dismantled by his successors and used as infill for new constructions in the Temple of Karnak; when they were later dismantled by archaeologists, some 36,000 decorated blocks from the original Aten building here were revealed that preserve many elements of the original relief scenes and inscriptions.

One of the most important turning points in the early reign of Amenhotep IV is a speech given by the pharaoh at the beginning of his second regnal year. A copy of the speech survives on one of the pylons at the Karnak Temple Complex near Thebes. Speaking to the royal court, scribes or the people, Amenhotep IV said that the gods were ineffective and had ceased their movements, and that their temples had collapsed. The pharaoh contrasted this with the only remaining god, the sun disc Aten, who continued to move and exist forever. Some Egyptologists, such as Donald B. Redford, compared this speech to a proclamation or manifesto, which foreshadowed and explained the pharaoh&#x27;s later religious reforms centered around the Aten. In his speech, Akhenaten said:

In Year Five of his reign, Amenhotep IV took decisive steps to establish the Aten as the sole god of Egypt. The pharaoh &quot;disbanded the priesthoods of all the other gods... and diverted the income from these [other] cults to support the Aten.&quot; To emphasize his complete allegiance to the Aten, the king officially changed his name from Amenhotep IV to Akhenaten (, meaning &quot;Effective for the Aten&quot;). Meanwhile, the Aten was becoming a king itself. Artists started to depict him with the trappings of pharaohs, placing his name in cartouches—a rare, but not unique occurrence, as the names of Ra-Horakhty and Amun-Ra had also been found enclosed in cartouches—and wearing a uraeus, a symbol of kingship. The Aten may also have been the subject of Akhenaten&#x27;s royal Sed festival early in the pharaoh&#x27;s reign. With Aten becoming a sole deity, Akhenaten started to proclaim himself as the only intermediary between Aten and his people, and the subject of their personal worship and attention—a feature not unheard of in Egyptian history, with Fifth Dynasty pharaohs such as Nyuserre Ini proclaiming to be sole intermediaries between the people and the gods Osiris and Ra.


By Year Nine of his reign, Akhenaten declared that Aten was not merely the supreme god, but the only worshipable god. He ordered the defacing of Amun&#x27;s temples throughout Egypt and, in a number of instances, inscriptions of the plural &#x27;gods&#x27; were also removed. This emphasized the changes encouraged by the new regime, which included a ban on images, with the exception of a rayed solar disc, in which the rays appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten, who by then was evidently considered not merely a sun god, but rather a universal deity. All life on Earth depended on the Aten and the visible sunlight. Representations of the Aten were always accompanied with a sort of hieroglyphic footnote, stating that the representation of the sun as all-encompassing creator was to be taken as just that: a representation of something that, by its very nature as something transcending creation, cannot be fully or adequately represented by any one part of that creation. Aten&#x27;s name was also written differently starting as early as Year Eight or as late as Year Fourteen, according to some historians. From &quot;Living Re-Horakhty, who rejoices in the horizon in his name Shu-Re who is in Aten&quot;, the god&#x27;s name changed to &quot;Living Re, ruler of the horizon, who rejoices in his name of Re the father who has returned as Aten&quot;, removing the Aten&#x27;s connection to Re-Horakhty and Shu, two other solar deities. The Aten thus became an amalgamation that incorporated the attributes and beliefs around Re-Horakhty, universal sun god, and Shu, god of the sky and manifestation of the sunlight.

Akhenaten&#x27;s Atenist beliefs are best distilled in the Great Hymn to the Aten. The hymn was discovered in the tomb of Ay, one of Akhenaten&#x27;s successors, though Egyptologists believe that it could have been composed by Akhenaten himself. The hymn celebrates the sun and daylight and recounts the dangers that abound when the sun sets. It tells of the Aten as a sole god and the creator of all life, who recreates life every day at sunrise, and on whom everything on Earth depends, including the natural world, people&#x27;s lives, and even trade and commerce. In one passage, the hymn declares: &quot;O Sole God beside whom there is none! You made the earth as you wished, you alone.&quot; The hymn also states that Akhenaten is the only intermediary between the god and Egyptians, and the only one who can understand the Aten: &quot;You are in my heart, and there is none who knows you except your son.&quot;

=== Atenism and other gods ===

Some debate has focused on the extent to which Akhenaten forced his religious reforms on his people. Certainly, as time drew on, he revised the names of the Aten, and other religious language, to increasingly exclude references to other gods; at some point, also, he embarked on the wide-scale erasure of traditional gods&#x27; names, especially those of Amun. Some of his court changed their names to remove them from the patronage of other gods and place them under that of Aten (or Ra, with whom Akhenaten equated the Aten). Yet, even at Amarna itself, some courtiers kept such names as Ahmose (&quot;child of the moon god&quot;, the owner of tomb 3), and the sculptor&#x27;s workshop where the famous Nefertiti Bust and other works of royal portraiture were found is associated with an artist known to have been called Thutmose (&quot;child of Thoth&quot;). An overwhelmingly large number of faience amulets at Amarna also show that talismans of the household-and-childbirth gods Bes and Taweret, the eye of Horus, and amulets of other traditional deities, were openly worn by its citizens. Indeed, a cache of royal jewelry found buried near the Amarna royal tombs (now in the National Museum of Scotland) includes a finger ring referring to Mut, the wife of Amun. Such evidence suggests that though Akhenaten shifted funding away from traditional temples, his policies were fairly tolerant until some point, perhaps a particular event as yet unknown, toward the end of the reign.

Archaeological discoveries at Akhetaten show that many ordinary residents of this city chose to gouge or chisel out all references to the god Amun on even minor personal items that they owned, such as commemorative scarabs or make-up pots, perhaps for fear of being accused of having Amunist sympathies. References to Amenhotep III, Akhenaten&#x27;s father, were partly erased since they contained the traditional Amun form of his name: Nebmaatre Amunhotep.

=== After Akhenaten ===

Following Akhenaten&#x27;s death, Egypt gradually returned to its traditional polytheistic religion, partly because of how closely associated the Aten became with Akhenaten. Atenism likely stayed dominant through the reigns of Akhenaten&#x27;s immediate successors, Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten, as well as early in the reign of Tutankhaten. For some years the worship of Aten and a resurgent worship of Amun coexisted.

Over time, however, Akhenaten&#x27;s successors, starting with Tutankhaten, took steps to distance themselves from Atenism. Tutankhaten and his wife Ankhesenpaaten dropped the Aten from their names and changed them to Tutankhamun and Ankhesenamun, respectively. Amun was restored as the supreme deity. Tutankhamun reestablished the temples of the other gods, as the pharaoh propagated on his Restoration Stela: &quot;He reorganized this land, restoring its customs to those of the time of Re. ... He renewed the gods&#x27; mansions and fashioned all their images. ... He raised up their temples and created their statues. ... When he had sought out the gods&#x27; precincts which were in ruins in this land, he refounded them just as they had been since the time of the first primeval age.&quot; Additionally, Tutankhamun&#x27;s building projects at Thebes and Karnak used talatat&#x27;s from Akhenaten&#x27;s buildings, which implies that Tutankhamun might have started to demolish temples dedicated to the Aten. Aten temples continued to be torn down under Ay and Horemheb, Tutankhamun&#x27;s successors and the last pharaohs of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Horemheb might also have ordered the demolition of Akhetaten, Akhenaten&#x27;s capital city. Further underlining the break with Aten worship, Horemheb claimed to have been chosen to rule by the god Horus. Finally, Seti I, the second pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty, ordered the name of Amun to be restored on inscriptions where it had been removed or replaced by Aten.

== Artistic depictions ==

Styles of art that flourished during the reigns of Akhenaten and his immediate successors, known as Amarna art, are markedly different from the traditional art of ancient Egypt. Representations are more realistic, expressionistic, and naturalistic, especially in depictions of animals, plants and people, and convey more action and movement for both non-royal and royal individuals than the traditionally static representations. In traditional art, a pharaoh&#x27;s divine nature was expressed by repose, even immobility.

The portrayals of Akhenaten himself greatly differ from the depictions of other pharaohs. Traditionally, the portrayal of pharaohs—and the Egyptian ruling class—was idealized, and they were shown in &quot;stereotypically &#x27;beautiful&#x27; fashion&quot; as youthful and athletic. However, Akhenaten&#x27;s portrayals are unconventional and &quot;unflattering&quot; with a sagging stomach; broad hips; thin legs; thick thighs; large, &quot;almost feminine breasts&quot;; a thin, &quot;exaggeratedly long face&quot;; and thick lips.

Based on Akhenaten&#x27;s and his family&#x27;s unusual artistic representations, including potential depictions of gynecomastia and androgyny, some have argued that the pharaoh and his family have either had aromatase excess syndrome and sagittal craniosynostosis syndrome, or Antley–Bixler syndrome. In 2010, results published from genetic studies on Akhenaten&#x27;s purported mummy did not find signs of gynecomastia or Antley-Bixler syndrome, although these results have since been questioned.

Arguing instead for a symbolic interpretation, Dominic Montserrat in &quot;Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt&quot; states that &quot;there is now a broad consensus among Egyptologists that the exaggerated forms of Akhenaten&#x27;s physical portrayal... are not to be read literally&quot;. Because the god Aten was referred to as &quot;the mother and father of all humankind&quot;, Montserrat and others suggest that Akhenaten was made to look androgynous in artwork as a symbol of the androgyny of the Aten. This required &quot;a symbolic gathering of all the attributes of the creator god into the physical body of the king himself&quot;, which will &quot;display on earth the Aten&#x27;s multiple life-giving functions&quot;. Akhenaten claimed the title &quot;The Unique One of Re&quot;, and he may have directed his artists to contrast him with the common people through a radical departure from the idealized traditional pharaoh image.

Depictions of other members of the court, especially members of the royal family, are also exaggerated, stylized, and overall different from traditional art. Significantly, and for the only time in the history of Egyptian royal art, the pharaoh&#x27;s family life is depicted: the royal family is shown mid-action in relaxed, casual, and intimate situations, taking part in decidedly naturalistic activities, showing affection for each other, such as holding hands and kissing.

Nefertiti also appears, both beside the king and alone, or with her daughters, in actions usually reserved for a pharaoh, such as &quot;smiting the enemy&quot;, a traditional depiction of male pharaohs. This suggests that she enjoyed unusual status for a queen. Early artistic representations of her tend to be indistinguishable from her husband&#x27;s except by her regalia, but soon after the move to the new capital, Nefertiti begins to be depicted with features specific to her. Questions remain whether the beauty of Nefertiti is portraiture or idealism.

==Speculative theories==

Akhenaten&#x27;s status as a religious revolutionary has led to much speculation, ranging from scholarly hypotheses to non-academic fringe theories. Although some believe the religion he introduced was mostly monotheistic, many others see Akhenaten as a practitioner of an Aten monolatry, as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshiping any but the Aten.

===Akhenaten and monotheism in Abrahamic religions===
The idea that Akhenaten was the pioneer of a monotheistic religion that later became Judaism has been considered by various scholars. One of the first to mention this was Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, in his book &quot;Moses and Monotheism&quot;. Basing his arguments on his belief that the Exodus story was historical, Freud argued that Moses had been an Atenist priest who was forced to leave Egypt with his followers after Akhenaten&#x27;s death. Freud argued that Akhenaten was striving to promote monotheism, something that the biblical Moses was able to achieve. Following the publication of his book, the concept entered popular consciousness and serious research.

Freud commented on the connection between Adonai, the Egyptian Aten and the Syrian divine name of Adonis as stemming from a common root; in this he was following the argument of Egyptologist Arthur Weigall. Jan Assmann&#x27;s opinion is that &#x27;Aten&#x27; and &#x27;Adonai&#x27; are not linguistically related.

There are strong similarities between Akhenaten&#x27;s Great Hymn to the Aten and the Biblical Psalm 104, but there is debate as to relationship implied by this similarity.

Others have likened some aspects of Akhenaten&#x27;s relationship with the Aten to the relationship, in Christian tradition, between Jesus Christ and God, particularly interpretations that emphasize a more monotheistic interpretation of Atenism than a henotheistic one. Donald B. Redford has noted that some have viewed Akhenaten as a harbinger of Jesus. &quot;After all, Akhenaten did call himself the son of the sole god: &#x27;Thine only son that came forth from thy body&#x27;.&quot; James Henry Breasted likened him to Jesus, Arthur Weigall saw him as a failed precursor of Christ and Thomas Mann saw him &quot;as right on the way and yet not the right one for the way&quot;.

Although scholars like Brian Fagan (2015) and Robert Alter (2018) have re-opened the debate, in 1997, Redford concluded:
===Possible illness===


The unconventional portrayals of Akhenaten—different from the traditional athletic norm in the portrayal of pharaohs—have led Egyptologists in the 19th and 20th centuries to suppose that Akhenaten had some kind of genetic abnormality. Various illnesses have been put forward, with Fröhlich&#x27;s syndrome or Marfan syndrome being mentioned most commonly.

Cyril Aldred, following up earlier arguments of Grafton Elliot Smith and James Strachey, suggested that Akhenaten may have had Fröhlich&#x27;s syndrome on the basis of his long jaw and his feminine appearance. However, this is unlikely, because this disorder results in sterility and Akhenaten is known to have fathered numerous children. His children are repeatedly portrayed through years of archaeological and iconographic evidence.

Burridge suggested that Akhenaten may have had Marfan syndrome, which, unlike Fröhlich&#x27;s, does not result in mental impairment or sterility. People with Marfan syndrome tend towards tallness, with a long, thin face, elongated skull, overgrown ribs, a funnel or pigeon chest, a high curved or slightly cleft palate, and larger pelvis, with enlarged thighs and spindly calves, symptoms that appear in some depictions of Akhenaten. Marfan syndrome is a dominant characteristic, which means those affected have a 50% chance of passing it on to their children. However, DNA tests on Tutankhamun in 2010 proved negative for Marfan syndrome.

By the early 21st century, most Egyptologists argued that Akhenaten&#x27;s portrayals are not the results of a genetic or medical condition, but rather should be interpreted as stylized portrayals influenced by Atenism. Akhenaten was made to look androgynous in artwork as a symbol of the androgyny of the Aten.

==Cultural depictions==

Akhenaten&#x27;s life, accomplishments, and legacy have been preserved and depicted in many ways, and he has figured in works of both high and popular culture since his rediscovery in the 19th century AD. Akhenaten—alongside Cleopatra and Alexander the Great—is among the most often popularized and fictionalized ancient historical figures.

On page, Amarna novels most often take one of two forms. They are either a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;, focusing on Akhenaten&#x27;s psychological and moral growth as it relates to establishing Atenism and Akhetaten, as well as his struggles against the Theban Amun cult. Alternatively, his literary depictions focus on the aftermath of his reign and religion. A dividing line also exists between depictions of Akhenaten from before the 1920s and since, when more and more archeological discoveries started to provide artists with material evidence about his life and times. Thus, before the 1920s, Akhenaten had appeared as &quot;a ghost, a spectral figure&quot; in art, while since he has become realistic, &quot;material and tangible&quot;. Examples of the former include the romance novels &quot;In the Tombs of the Kings&quot; (1910) by Lilian Bagnall—the first appearance by Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti in fiction—and &quot;A Wife Out of Egypt&quot; (1913) and &quot;There Was a King in Egypt&quot; (1918) by Norma Lorimer. Examples of the latter include &quot;Akhnaton King of Egypt&quot; (1924) by Dmitry Merezhkovsky, &quot;Joseph and His Brothers&quot; (1933–1943) by Thomas Mann, &quot;Akhnaton&quot; (1973) by Agatha Christie, and &quot;Akhenaten, Dweller in Truth&quot; (1985) by Naguib Mahfouz. Akhenaten also appears in &quot;The Egyptian&quot; (1945) by Mika Waltari, which was adapted into the movie &quot;The Egyptian&quot; (1953). In this movie, Akhenaten, portrayed by Michael Wilding, appears to represent Jesus Christ and his followers proto-Christians.

A sexualized image of Akhenaten, building on early Western interest in the pharaoh&#x27;s androgynous depictions, perceived potential homosexuality, and identification with Oedipal storytelling, also influenced modern works of art. The two most notable portrayals are &quot;Akenaten&quot; (1975), an unfilmed screenplay by Derek Jarman, and &quot;Akhnaten&quot; (1984), an opera by Philip Glass. Both were influenced by the unproven and scientifically unsupported theories of Immanuel Velikovsky, who equated Oedipus with Akhenaten, although Glass specifically denies his personal belief in Velikovsky&#x27;s Oedipus theory, or caring about its historical validity, instead being drawn to its potential theatricality.

In the 21st century, Akhenaten appeared as an antagonist in comic books and video games. For example, he is the major antagonist in limited comic-book series &quot;&quot; (2003). In this series, Akhenaten is abducted by an alien order in the 14th century BC and reappears on modern Earth seeking to restore his kingdom. He is opposed by essentially all of the other superheroes and supervillains in the Marvel comic book universe and is eventually defeated by Thanos. Additionally, Akhenaten appears as the enemy in the &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins The Curse of the Pharaohs&quot; downloadable content (2017), and must be defeated to remove his curse on Thebes. His afterlife takes the form of &#x27;Aten&#x27;, a location that draws heavily on the architecture of the city of Amarna.

American death metal band Nile depicted Akhenaten&#x27;s judgement, punishment, and erasure from history at the hands of the pantheon that he replaced with Aten, in the song &quot;Cast Down the Heretic&quot;, from their 2005 album &quot;Annihilation of the Wicked&quot;. He was also featured on the cover artwork of their 2009 album, &quot;Those Whom the Gods Detest&quot;.

<doc id="89732" wikidata="Q182324" url="?curid=89732" title="Antikythera mechanism">
<text>The Antikythera mechanism ( , ) is an Ancient Greek hand-powered orrery (model of the Solar System). It is the oldest known example of an analogue computer. It could be used to predict astronomical positions and eclipses decades in advance. It could also be used to track the four-year cycle of athletic games similar to an Olympiad, the cycle of the ancient Olympic Games.

The artefact was among wreckage retrieved from a shipwreck off the coast of the Greek island Antikythera in 1901. In 1902, it was identified by archaeologist Valerios Stais as containing a gear. The device, housed in the remains of a wooden-framed case of (uncertain) overall size , was found as one lump, later separated into three main fragments which are now divided into 82 separate fragments after conservation efforts. Four of these fragments contain gears, while inscriptions are found on many others. The largest gear is about in diameter and originally had 223 teeth. All these fragments of the mechanism are kept at the National Archaeological Museum, Athens, along with reconstructions and replicas, to demonstrate how it may have looked and worked.

In 2005, a team from Cardiff University used computer X-ray tomography and high resolution scanning to image inside fragments of the crust-encased mechanism and read the faintest inscriptions that once covered the outer casing. These scans suggest that the mechanism had 37 meshing bronze gears enabling it to follow the movements of the Moon and the Sun through the zodiac, to predict eclipses and to model the irregular orbit of the Moon, where the Moon&#x27;s velocity is higher in its perigee than in its apogee. This motion was studied in the 2nd century BC by astronomer Hipparchus of Rhodes, and he may have been consulted in the machine&#x27;s construction. There is speculation that a portion of the mechanism is missing and it calculated the positions of the five classical planets. The inscriptions were further deciphered in 2016, revealing numbers connected with the synodic cycles of Venus and Saturn.

The instrument is believed to have been designed and constructed by Hellenistic scientists and been variously dated to about 87 BC, between 150 and 100 BC, or 205 BC. It must have been constructed before the shipwreck, which has been dated by multiple lines of evidence to approximately 70–60 BC. In 2022 researchers proposed its initial calibration date, not construction date, could have been 23 December 178 BC. Other experts propose 204 BC as a more likely calibration date. Machines with similar complexity did not appear again until the 14th century in western Europe.

==History==
===Discovery===

Captain Dimitrios Kontos () and a crew of sponge divers from Symi island discovered the Antikythera wreck in early 1900, and recovered artefacts during the first expedition with the Hellenic Royal Navy, in 1900–01. This wreck of a Roman cargo ship was found at a depth of off Point Glyphadia on the Greek island of Antikythera. The team retrieved numerous large objects, including bronze and marble statues, pottery, unique glassware, jewellery, coins, and the mechanism. The mechanism was retrieved from the wreckage in 1901, probably July. It is unknown how the mechanism came to be on the cargo ship.

All of the items retrieved from the wreckage were transferred to the National Museum of Archaeology in Athens for storage and analysis. The mechanism appeared to be a lump of corroded bronze and wood; it went unnoticed for two years, while museum staff worked on piecing together more obvious treasures, such as the statues. Upon removal from seawater, the mechanism was not treated, resulting in deformational changes.

On 17 May 1902, archaeologist Valerios Stais found one of the pieces of rock had a gear wheel embedded in it. He initially believed that it was an astronomical clock, but most scholars considered the device to be prochronistic, too complex to have been constructed during the same period as the other pieces that had been discovered.

The German philologist Albert Rehm became interested in the device and was the first to propose that it was an astronomical calculator.

Investigations into the object lapsed until British science historian and Yale University professor Derek J. de Solla Price became interested in 1951. In 1971, Price and Greek nuclear physicist Charalampos Karakalos made X-ray and gamma-ray images of the 82 fragments. Price published a paper on their findings in 1974.

Two other searches for items at the Antikythera wreck site in 2012 and 2015 yielded art objects and a second ship which may, or may not, be connected with the treasure ship on which the mechanism was found. Also found was a bronze disc, embellished with the image of a bull. The disc has four &quot;ears&quot; which have holes in them, and it was thought it may have been part of the Antikythera mechanism, as a &quot;cog wheel&quot;. There appears to be little evidence that it was part of the mechanism; it is more likely the disc was a bronze decoration on a piece of furniture.

===Origin===
The Antikythera mechanism is generally referred to as the first known analogue computer. The quality and complexity of the mechanism&#x27;s manufacture suggests it must have had undiscovered predecessors during the Hellenistic period. Its construction relied on theories of astronomy and mathematics developed by Greek astronomers during the second century BC, and it is estimated to have been built in the late second century BC or the early first century BC.

In 2008, research by the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project suggested the concept for the mechanism may have originated in the colonies of Corinth, since they identified the calendar on the Metonic Spiral as coming from Corinth, or one of its colonies in northwest Greece or Sicily. Syracuse was a colony of Corinth and the home of Archimedes, and the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project argued in 2008 that it might imply a connection with the school of Archimedes. It was demonstrated in 2017 that the calendar on the Metonic Spiral is of the Corinthian type, but cannot be that of Syracuse. Another theory suggests that coins found by Jacques Cousteau at the wreck site in the 1970s date to the time of the device&#x27;s construction, and posits that its origin may have been from the ancient Greek city of Pergamon, home of the Library of Pergamum. With its many scrolls of art and science, it was second in importance only to the Library of Alexandria during the Hellenistic period.

The ship carrying the device contained vases in the Rhodian style, leading to a hypothesis that it was constructed at an academy founded by Stoic philosopher Posidonius on that Greek island. Rhodes was a busy trading port and centre of astronomy and mechanical engineering, home to astronomer Hipparchus, who was active from about 140–120 BC. The mechanism uses Hipparchus&#x27; theory for the motion of the Moon, which suggests he may have designed or at least worked on it. It has been argued the astronomical events on the Parapegma of the mechanism work best for latitudes in the range of 33.3–37.0 degrees north; the island of Rhodes is located between the latitudes of 35.85 and 36.50 degrees north.

In 2014, a study argued for a new dating of approximately 200 BC, based on identifying the start-up date on the Saros Dial, as the astronomical lunar month that began shortly after the new moon of 28 April 205 BC. According to this theory the Babylonian arithmetic style of prediction fits much better with the device&#x27;s predictive models than the traditional Greek trigonometric style. A study by Iversen in 2017 reasons that the prototype for the device was from Rhodes, but that this particular model was modified for a client from Epirus in northwestern Greece; Iversen argues it was probably constructed no earlier than a generation before the shipwreck, a date supported by Jones in 2017.

Further dives were undertaken in 2014 and 2015, in the hope of discovering more of the mechanism. A five-year programme of investigations began in 2014 and ended in October 2019, with a new five-year session starting in May 2020.

In 2022 researchers proposed the mechanism&#x27;s initial calibration date, not construction date, could have been 23 December 178 BC. Other experts propose 204 BC as a more likely calibration date. Machines with similar complexity did not appear again until the fourteenth century, with early examples being astronomical clocks of Richard of Wallingford and Giovanni de&#x27; Dondi.

== Design ==

The original mechanism apparently came out of the Mediterranean as a single encrusted piece. Soon afterwards it fractured into three major pieces. Other small pieces have broken off in the interim from cleaning and handling, and others were found on the sea floor by the Cousteau expedition. Other fragments may still be in storage, undiscovered since their initial recovery; Fragment F was discovered in that way in 2005. Of the 82 known fragments, seven are mechanically significant and contain the majority of the mechanism and inscriptions. Another 16 smaller parts contain fractional and incomplete inscriptions.

Many of the smaller fragments that have been found contain nothing of apparent value, but a few have inscriptions on them. Fragment 19 contains significant back door inscriptions including one reading &quot;... 76 years ...&quot; which refers to the Callippic cycle. Other inscriptions seem to describe the function of the back dials. In addition to this important minor fragment, 15 further minor fragments have remnants of inscriptions on them.

==Mechanics==
Information on the specific data obtained from the fragments is detailed in the supplement to the 2006 &quot;Nature&quot; article from Freeth et al.

===Operation===
On the front face of the mechanism, there is a fixed ring dial representing the ecliptic, the twelve zodiacal signs marked off with equal 30-degree sectors. This matched with the Babylonian custom of assigning one twelfth of the ecliptic to each zodiac sign equally, even though the constellation boundaries were variable. Outside that dial is another ring which is rotatable, marked off with the months and days of the Sothic Egyptian calendar, twelve months of 30 days plus five intercalary days. The months are marked with the Egyptian names for the months transcribed into the Greek alphabet. The first task is to rotate the Egyptian calendar ring to match the current zodiac points. The Egyptian calendar ignored leap days, so it advanced through a full zodiac sign in about 120 years.

The mechanism was operated by turning a small hand crank (now lost) which was linked via a crown gear to the largest gear, the four-spoked gear visible on the front of fragment A, gear b1. This moved the date pointer on the front dial, which would be set to the correct Egyptian calendar day. The year is not selectable, so it is necessary to know the year currently set, or by looking up the cycles indicated by the various calendar cycle indicators on the back in the Babylonian ephemeris tables for the day of the year currently set, since most of the calendar cycles are not synchronous with the year. The crank moves the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation, so hitting a particular day on the dial would be easily possible if the mechanism were in good working condition. The action of turning the hand crank would also cause all interlocked gears within the mechanism to rotate, resulting in the simultaneous calculation of the position of the Sun and Moon, the moon phase, eclipse, and calendar cycles, and perhaps the locations of planets.

The operator also had to be aware of the position of the spiral dial pointers on the two large dials on the back. The pointer had a &quot;follower&quot; that tracked the spiral incisions in the metal as the dials incorporated four and five full rotations of the pointers. When a pointer reached the terminal month location at either end of the spiral, the pointer&#x27;s follower had to be manually moved to the other end of the spiral before proceeding further.

===Faces===
====Front face====
The front dial has two concentric circular scales. The inner scale marks the Greek signs of the zodiac, with division in degrees. The outer scale, which is a movable ring that sits flush with the surface and runs in a channel, is marked off with what appear to be days and has a series of corresponding holes beneath the ring in the channel.

Since the discovery of the mechanism more than a century ago, this outer ring has been presumed to represent a 365-day Egyptian solar calendar, but research (Budiselic, et al., 2020) challenged this presumption and provided direct statistical evidence there are 354 intervals, suggesting a lunar calendar. Since this initial discovery, two research teams, using different methods, independently calculated the interval count. Woan and Bayley calculate 354–355 intervals using two different methods, confirming with higher accuracy the Budiselic et al. findings and noting that &quot;365 holes is not plausible&quot;. Malin and Dickens&#x27; best estimate is 352.3±1.5 and concluded that the number of holes (N) &quot;has to be integral and the SE (standard error) of 1.5 indicates that there is less than a 5% probability that N is not one of the six values in the range 350 to 355. The chances of N being as high as 365 are less than 1 in 10,000. While other contenders cannot be ruled out, of the two values that have been proposed for N on astronomical grounds, that of Budiselic et al. (354) is by far the more likely.&quot;

If one supports the 365 day presumption, it is recognized the mechanism predates the Julian calendar reform, but the Sothic and Callippic cycles had already pointed to a  day solar year, as seen in Ptolemy III&#x27;s attempted calendar reform of 238 BC. The dials are not believed to reflect his proposed leap day (Epag. 6), but the outer calendar dial may be moved against the inner dial to compensate for the effect of the extra quarter-day in the solar year by turning the scale backward one day every four years.

If one is in favour of the 354 day evidence, the most likely interpretation is that the ring is a manifestation of a 354-day lunar calendar. Given the era of the mechanism&#x27;s presumed construction and the presence of Egyptian month names, it is possibly the first example of the Egyptian civil-based lunar calendar proposed by Richard Anthony Parker in 1950. The lunar calendar&#x27;s purpose was to serve as a day-to-day indicator of successive lunations, and would also have assisted with the interpretation of the lunar phase pointer, and the Metonic and Saros dials. Undiscovered gearing, synchronous with the rest of the Metonic gearing of the mechanism, is implied to drive a pointer around this scale. Movement and registration of the ring relative to the underlying holes served to facilitate both a 1-in-76-year Callippic cycle correction, as well as convenient lunisolar intercalation.

The dial also marks the position of the Sun on the ecliptic, corresponding to the current date in the year. The orbits of the Moon and the five planets known to the Greeks are close enough to the ecliptic to make it a convenient reference for defining their positions as well.

The following three Egyptian months are inscribed in Greek letters on the surviving pieces of the outer ring:
* (Pachon)
* (Payni)
* (Epiphi)

The other months have been reconstructed; some reconstructions of the mechanism omit the five days of the Egyptian intercalary month. The Zodiac dial contains Greek inscriptions of the members of the zodiac, which is believed to be adapted to the tropical month version rather than the sidereal:

* ( [Ram], Aries)
* ΤΑΥΡΟΣ (Tauros [Bull], Taurus)
* ΔΙΔΥΜΟΙ (Didymoi [Twins], Gemini)
* ΚΑΡΚΙΝΟΣ (Karkinos [Crab], Cancer)
* ΛΕΩΝ (Leon [Lion], Leo)
* ΠΑΡΘΕΝΟΣ (Parthenos [Maiden], Virgo)
* ΧΗΛΑΙ (Chelai [Scorpio&#x27;s Claw or Zygos], Libra)
* ΣΚΟΡΠΙΟΣ (Skorpios [Scorpion], Scorpio)
* ΤΟΞΟΤΗΣ (Toxotes [Archer], Sagittarius)
* ΑΙΓΟΚΕΡΩΣ (Aigokeros [Goat-horned], Capricorn)
* ΥΔΡΟΧΟΟΣ (Hydrokhoos [Water carrier], Aquarius)
* ΙΧΘΥΕΣ (Ichthyes [Fish], Pisces)

Also on the zodiac dial are single characters at specific points (see reconstruction at ref). They are keyed to a &quot;parapegma&quot;, a precursor of the modern day almanac inscribed on the front face above and beneath the dials. They mark the locations of longitudes on the ecliptic for specific stars. The &quot;parapegma&quot; above the dials reads (square brackets indicate inferred text):

The &quot;parapegma&quot; beneath the dials reads:

At least two pointers indicated positions of bodies upon the ecliptic. A lunar pointer indicated the position of the Moon, and a mean Sun pointer was shown, perhaps doubling as the current date pointer. The Moon position was not a simple mean Moon indicator which would indicate movement uniformly around a circular orbit; rather, it approximated the acceleration and deceleration of the Moon&#x27;s elliptical orbit, through the earliest extant use of epicyclic gearing.

It also tracked the precession of the moon&#x27;s elliptical orbit around the ecliptic in an 8.88 year cycle. The mean Sun position is, by definition, the current date. It is speculated that since significant effort was taken to ensure the position of the Moon was correct, there was likely to have also been a &quot;true sun&quot; pointer in addition to the mean Sun pointer, to track the elliptical anomaly of the Sun (the orbit of Earth around the Sun), but there is no evidence of it among the fragments found. Similarly, neither is there the evidence of planetary orbit pointers for the five planets known to the Greeks among the fragments. But see Proposed gear schemes below.

Mechanical engineer Michael Wright demonstrated there was a mechanism to supply the lunar phase in addition to the position. The indicator was a small ball embedded in the lunar pointer, half-white and half-black, which rotated to show the phase (new, first quarter, half, third quarter, full, and back). The data to support this function is available given the Sun and Moon positions as angular rotations; essentially, it is the angle between the two, translated into the rotation of the ball. It requires a differential gear, a gearing arrangement that sums or differences two angular inputs.

====Rear face====

In 2008, scientists reported new findings in &quot;Nature&quot; showing the mechanism not only tracked the Metonic calendar and predicted solar eclipses, but also calculated the timing of panhellenic athletic games, such as the ancient Olympic Games. Inscriptions on the instrument closely match the names of the months that are used on calendars from Epirus in northwestern Greece and with the island of Corfu, which in antiquity was known as Corcyra.

On the back of the mechanism, there are five dials: the two large displays, the Metonic and the Saros, and three smaller indicators, the so-called Olympiad Dial, which has been renamed the Games dial as it did not track Olympiad years (the four-year cycle it tracks most closely is the Halieiad), the Callippic, and the exeligmos.

The Metonic dial is the main upper dial on the rear of the mechanism. The Metonic cycle, defined in several physical units, is 235 synodic months, which is very close (to within less than 13 one-millionths) to 19 tropical years. It is therefore a convenient interval over which to convert between lunar and solar calendars. The Metonic dial covers 235 months in five rotations of the dial, following a spiral track with a follower on the pointer that keeps track of the layer of the spiral. The pointer points to the synodic month, counted from new moon to new moon, and the cell contains the Corinthian month names.
# ΚΡΑΝΕΙΟΣ (Kraneios)
# ΛΑΝΟΤΡΟΠΙΟΣ (Lanotropios)
# ΜΑΧΑΝΕΥΣ (Machaneus, &quot;mechanic&quot;, referring to Zeus the inventor)
# ΔΩΔΕΚΑΤΕΥΣ (Dodekateus)
# ΕΥΚΛΕΙΟΣ (Eukleios)
# ΑΡΤΕΜΙΣΙΟΣ (Artemisios)
# ΨΥΔΡΕΥΣ (Psydreus)
# ΓΑΜΕΙΛΙΟΣ (Gameilios)
# ΑΓΡΙΑΝΙΟΣ (Agrianios)
# ΠΑΝΑΜΟΣ (Panamos)
# ΑΠΕΛΛΑΙΟΣ (Apellaios)

Thus, setting the correct solar time (in days) on the front panel indicates the current lunar month on the back panel, with resolution to within a week or so.

Based on the fact that the calendar month names are consistent with all the evidence of the Epirote calendar and that the Games dial mentions the very minor Naa games of Dodona (in Epirus), it has been argued that the calendar on the mechanism is likely to be the Epirote calendar, and that this calendar was probably adopted from a Corinthian colony in Epirus, possibly Ambracia. It has been argued that the first month of the calendar, Phoinikaios, was ideally the month in which the autumn equinox fell, and that the start-up date of the calendar began shortly after the astronomical new moon of 23 August 205 BC.

The Games dial is the right secondary upper dial; it is the only pointer on the instrument that travels in an anticlockwise direction as time advances. The dial is divided into four sectors, each of which is inscribed with a year indicator and the name of two Panhellenic Games: the &quot;crown&quot; games of Isthmia, Olympia, Nemea, and Pythia; and two lesser games: Naa (held at Dodona) and the Halieia of Rhodes. The inscriptions on each one of the four divisions are:

The Saros dial is the main lower spiral dial on the rear of the mechanism. The Saros cycle is 18 years and days long (6585.333... days), which is very close to 223 synodic months (6585.3211 days). It is defined as the cycle of repetition of the positions required to cause solar and lunar eclipses, and therefore, it could be used to predict them—not only the month, but the day and time of day. The cycle is approximately 8 hours longer than an integer number of days. Translated into global spin, that means an eclipse occurs not only eight hours later, but one-third of a rotation farther to the west. Glyphs in 51 of the 223 synodic month cells of the dial specify the occurrence of 38 lunar and 27 solar eclipses. Some of the abbreviations in the glyphs read:
* Σ = ΣΕΛΗΝΗ (&quot;Selene&quot;, Moon)
* Η = ΗΛΙΟΣ (&quot;Helios&quot;, Sun)
* H\M = ΗΜΕΡΑΣ (&quot;Hemeras&quot;, of the day)
* ω\ρ = ωρα (&quot;hora&quot;, hour)
* N\Y = ΝΥΚΤΟΣ (&quot;Nuktos&quot;, of the night)

The glyphs show whether the designated eclipse is solar or lunar, and give the day of the month and hour. Solar eclipses may not be visible at any given point, and lunar eclipses are visible only if the moon is above the horizon at the appointed hour. In addition, the inner lines at the cardinal points of the Saros dial indicate the start of a new full moon cycle. Based on the distribution of the times of the eclipses, it has been argued the start-up date of the Saros dial was shortly after the astronomical new moon of 28 April 205 BC.

The Exeligmos dial is the secondary lower dial on the rear of the mechanism. The exeligmos cycle is a 54-year triple Saros cycle that is 19,756 days long. Since the length of the Saros cycle is to a third of a day (namely, 6,585 days plus 8 hours), a full exeligmos cycle returns the counting to an integral number of days, as reflected in the inscriptions. The labels on its three divisions are:
* Blank or o ? (representing the number zero, assumed, not yet observed)
* H (number 8) means add 8 hours to the time mentioned in the display
* Iϛ (number 16) means add 16 hours to the time mentioned in the display

Thus the dial pointer indicates how many hours must be added to the glyph times of the Saros dial in order to calculate the exact eclipse times.

===Doors===

The mechanism has a wooden casing with a front and a back door, both containing inscriptions. The back door appears to be the &#x27;instruction manual&#x27;. On one of its fragments is written &quot;76 years, 19 years&quot; representing the Callippic and Metonic cycles. Also written is &quot;223&quot; for the Saros cycle. On another one of its fragments, it is written &quot;on the spiral subdivisions 235&quot; referring to the Metonic dial.

===Gearing===
The mechanism is remarkable for the level of miniaturisation and the complexity of its parts, which is comparable to that of 14th-century astronomical clocks. It has at least 30 gears, although mechanism expert Michael Wright has suggested the Greeks of this period were capable of implementing a system with many more gears.

There is debate as to whether the mechanism had indicators for all five of the planets known to the ancient Greeks. No gearing for such a planetary display survives and all gears are accounted for—with the exception of one 63-toothed gear (r1) otherwise unaccounted for in fragment D.

Fragment D is a small quasi-circular constriction that, according to Xenophon Moussas, has a gear inside a somewhat larger hollow gear. The inner gear moves inside the outer gear reproducing an epicyclical motion that, with a pointer, gives the position of planet Jupiter. The inner gear is numbered 45, &quot;ME&quot; in Greek, and the same number is written on two surfaces of this small cylindrical box.

The purpose of the front face was to position astronomical bodies with respect to the celestial sphere along the ecliptic, in reference to the observer&#x27;s position on the Earth. That is irrelevant to the question of whether that position was computed using a heliocentric or geocentric view of the Solar System; either computational method should, and does, result in the same position (ignoring ellipticity), within the error factors of the mechanism. The epicyclic solar system of Ptolemy (–)—hundreds of years after the apparent construction date of the mechanism—carried forward with more epicycles, and was more accurate predicting the positions of planets than the view of Copernicus (1473–1543), until Kepler (1571–1630) introduced the possibility that orbits are ellipses.

Evans et al. suggest that to display the mean positions of the five classical planets would require only 17 further gears that could be positioned in front of the large driving gear and indicated using individual circular dials on the face.

Freeth and Jones modelled and published details of a version using gear trains mechanically similar to the lunar anomaly system, allowing for indication of the positions of the planets, as well as synthesis of the Sun anomaly. Their system, they claim, is more authentic than Wright&#x27;s model, as it uses the known skills of the Greeks and does not add excessive complexity or internal stresses to the machine.

The gear teeth were in the form of equilateral triangles with an average circular pitch of 1.6 mm, an average wheel thickness of 1.4 mm and an average air gap between gears of 1.2 mm. The teeth were probably created from a blank bronze round using hand tools; this is evident because not all of them are even. Due to advances in imaging and X-ray technology, it is now possible to know the precise number of teeth and size of the gears within the located fragments. Thus the basic operation of the device is no longer a mystery and has been replicated accurately. The major unknown remains the question of the presence and nature of any planet indicators.

A table of the gears, their teeth, and the expected and computed rotations of important gears follows. The gear functions come from Freeth et al. (2008) and for the lower half of the table from Freeth et al. (2012). The computed values start with 1 year per revolution for the b1 gear, and the remainder are computed directly from gear teeth ratios. The gears marked with an asterisk (*) are missing, or have predecessors missing, from the known mechanism; these gears have been calculated with reasonable gear teeth counts. (Lengths in days are calculated assuming the year to be 365.2425 days.)
 
&quot;Table notes:&quot;
There are several gear ratios for each planet that result in close matches to the correct values for synodic periods of the planets and the Sun. Those chosen above seem accurate, with reasonable tooth counts, but the specific gears actually used are unknown.

==== Known gear scheme ====
It is very probable there were planetary dials, as the complicated motions and periodicities of all planets are mentioned in the manual of the mechanism. The exact position and mechanisms for the gears of the planets is unknown. There is no coaxial system except for the Moon. Fragment D that is an epicycloidal system, is considered as a planetary gear for Jupiter (Moussas, 2011, 2012, 2014) or a gear for the motion of the Sun (University of Thessaloniki group).

The Sun gear is operated from the hand-operated crank (connected to gear a1, driving the large four-spoked mean Sun gear, b1) and in turn drives the rest of the gear sets. The Sun gear is b1/b2 and b2 has 64 teeth. It directly drives the date/mean sun pointer (there may have been a second, &quot;true sun&quot; pointer that displayed the Sun&#x27;s elliptical anomaly; it is discussed below in the Freeth reconstruction). In this discussion, reference is to modelled rotational period of various pointers and indicators; they all assume the input rotation of the b1 gear of 360 degrees, corresponding with one tropical year, and are computed solely on the basis of the gear ratios of the gears named.

The Moon train starts with gear b1 and proceeds through c1, c2, d1, d2, e2, e5, k1, k2, e6, e1, and b3 to the Moon pointer on the front face. The gears k1 and k2 form an epicyclic gear system; they are an identical pair of gears that do not mesh, but rather, they operate face-to-face, with a short pin on k1 inserted into a slot in k2. The two gears have different centres of rotation, so the pin must move back and forth in the slot. That increases and decreases the radius at which k2 is driven, also necessarily varying its angular velocity (presuming the velocity of k1 is even) faster in some parts of the rotation than others. Over an entire revolution the average velocities are the same, but the fast-slow variation models the effects of the elliptical orbit of the Moon, in consequence of Kepler&#x27;s second and third laws. The modelled rotational period of the Moon pointer (averaged over a year) is 27.321 days, compared to the modern length of a lunar sidereal month of 27.321661 days. The pin/slot driving of the k1/k2 gears varies the displacement over a year&#x27;s time, and the mounting of those two gears on the e3 gear supplies a precessional advancement to the ellipticity modelling with a period of 8.8826 years, compared with the current value of precession period of the moon of 8.85 years.

The system also models the phases of the Moon. The Moon pointer holds a shaft along its length, on which is mounted a small gear named r, which meshes to the Sun pointer at B0 (the connection between B0 and the rest of B is not visible in the original mechanism, so whether b0 is the current date/mean Sun pointer or a hypothetical true Sun pointer is unknown). The gear rides around the dial with the Moon, but is also geared to the Sun—the effect is to perform a differential gear operation, so the gear turns at the synodic month period, measuring in effect, the angle of the difference between the Sun and Moon pointers. The gear drives a small ball that appears through an opening in the Moon pointer&#x27;s face, painted longitudinally half white and half black, displaying the phases pictorially. It turns with a modelled rotational period of 29.53 days; the modern value for the synodic month is 29.530589 days.

The Metonic train is driven by the drive train b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, and n1, which is connected to the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the pointer is the length of the 6939.5 days (over the whole five-rotation spiral), while the modern value for the Metonic cycle is 6939.69 days.

The Olympiad train is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, n1, n2, and o1, which mounts the pointer. It has a computed modelled rotational period of exactly four years, as expected. It is the only pointer on the mechanism that rotates anticlockwise; all of the others rotate clockwise.

The Callippic train is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, n1, n3, p1, p2, and q1, which mounts the pointer. It has a computed modelled rotational period of 27758 days, while the modern value is 27758.8 days.

The Saros train is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m3, e3, e4, f1, f2, and g1, which mounts the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the Saros pointer is 1646.3 days (in four rotations along the spiral pointer track); the modern value is 1646.33 days.

The Exeligmos train is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m3, e3, e4, f1, f2, g1, g2, h1, h2, and i1, which mounts the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the exeligmos pointer is 19,756 days; the modern value is 19755.96 days.

It appears gears m3, n1-3, p1-2, and q1 did not survive in the wreckage. The functions of the pointers were deduced from the remains of the dials on the back face, and reasonable, appropriate gearage to fulfill the functions was proposed and is generally accepted.

==Reconstruction efforts==
===Proposed gear schemes===
Because of the large space between the mean Sun gear and the front of the case and the size of and mechanical features on the mean Sun gear, it is very likely that the mechanism contained further gearing that either has been lost in or subsequent to the shipwreck, or was removed before being loaded onto the ship. This lack of evidence and nature of the front part of the mechanism has led to attempts to emulate what the Ancient Greeks would have done and because of the lack of evidence, many solutions have been put forward over the years. But as progress has been made on analyzing the internal structures and deciphering the inscriptions, earlier models have been ruled out and better models developed.

Derek J. de Solla Price built a simple model in the 1970s.

In 2002 Michael Wright designed and built the first workable model with the known mechanism and his emulation of a potential planetarium system. He suggested that along with the lunar anomaly, adjustments would have been made for the deeper, more basic solar anomaly (known as the &quot;first anomaly&quot;). He included pointers for this &quot;true sun&quot;, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, in addition to the known &quot;mean sun&quot; (current time) and lunar pointers.

Evans, Carman, and Thorndike published a solution in 2010 with significant differences from Wright&#x27;s. Their proposal centred on what they observed as irregular spacing of the inscriptions on the front dial face, which to them seemed to indicate an off-centre sun indicator arrangement; this would simplify the mechanism by removing the need to simulate the solar anomaly. They suggested that rather than accurate planetary indication (rendered impossible by the offset inscriptions) there would be simple dials for each individual planet, showing information such as key events in the cycle of planet, initial and final appearances in the night sky, and apparent direction changes. This system would lead to a much simplified gear system, with much reduced forces and complexity, as compared to Wright&#x27;s model.

Their proposal used simple meshed gear trains and accounted for the previously unexplained 63 toothed gear in fragment D. They proposed two face plate layouts, one with evenly spaced dials, and another with a gap in the top of the face, to account for criticism that they did not use the apparent fixtures on the b1 gear. They proposed that rather than bearings and pillars for gears and axles, they simply held weather and seasonal icons to be displayed through a window. In a paper published in 2012, Carman, Thorndike, and Evans also proposed a system of epicyclic gearing with pin and slot followers.

Freeth and Jones published a proposal in 2012. They proposed a compact and feasible solution to the question of planetary indication. They also propose indicating the solar anomaly (that is, the sun&#x27;s apparent position in the zodiac dial) on a separate pointer from the date pointer, which indicates the mean position of the Sun, as well as the date on the month dial. If the two dials are synchronised correctly, their front panel display is essentially the same as Wright&#x27;s. Unlike Wright&#x27;s model however, this model has not been built physically, and is only a 3-D computer model.

The system to synthesise the solar anomaly is very similar to that used in Wright&#x27;s proposal: three gears, one fixed in the centre of the b1 gear and attached to the Sun spindle, the second fixed on one of the spokes (in their proposal the one on the bottom left) acting as an idle gear, and the final positioned next to that one; the final gear is fitted with an offset pin and, over said pin, an arm with a slot that in turn, is attached to the sun spindle, inducing anomaly as the mean Sun wheel turns.

The inferior planet mechanism includes the Sun (treated as a planet in this context), Mercury, and Venus. For each of the three systems, there is an epicyclic gear whose axis is mounted on b1, thus the basic frequency is the Earth year (as it is, in truth, for epicyclic motion in the Sun and all the planets—excepting only the Moon). Each meshes with a gear grounded to the mechanism frame. Each has a pin mounted, potentially on an extension of one side of the gear that enlarges the gear, but doesn&#x27;t interfere with the teeth; in some cases, the needed distance between the gear&#x27;s centre and the pin is farther than the radius of the gear itself. A bar with a slot along its length extends from the pin toward the appropriate coaxial tube, at whose other end is the object pointer, out in front of the front dials. The bars could have been full gears, although there is no need for the waste of metal, since the only working part is the slot. Also, using the bars avoids interference between the three mechanisms, each of which are set on one of the four spokes of b1. Thus there is one new grounded gear (one was identified in the wreckage, and the second is shared by two of the planets), one gear used to reverse the direction of the sun anomaly, three epicyclic gears and three bars/coaxial tubes/pointers, which would qualify as another gear each: five gears and three slotted bars in all.

The superior planet systems—Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn—all follow the same general principle of the lunar anomaly mechanism. Similar to the inferior systems, each has a gear whose centre pivot is on an extension of b1, and which meshes with a grounded gear. It presents a pin and a centre pivot for the epicyclic gear which has a slot for the pin, and which meshes with a gear fixed to a coaxial tube and thence to the pointer. Each of the three mechanisms can fit within a quadrant of the b1 extension, and they are thus all on a single plane parallel with the front dial plate. Each one uses a ground gear, a driving gear, a driven gear, and a gear/coaxial tube/pointer, thus, twelve gears additional in all.

In total, there are eight coaxial spindles of various nested sizes to transfer the rotations in the mechanism to the eight pointers. So in all, there are 30 original gears, seven gears added to complete calendar functionality, 17 gears and three slotted bars to support the six new pointers, for a grand total of 54 gears, three bars, and eight pointers in Freeth and Jones&#x27; design.

On the visual representation Freeth provides, the pointers on the front zodiac dial have small, round identifying stones. He refers to a quote from an ancient papyrus:

However, more recent discoveries and research have shown that the above models are not correct. In 2016, the numbers 462 and 442 were found in computed tomography scans of the inscriptions dealing with Venus and Saturn, respectively. These relate to the synodic cycles of these planets, and indicated that the mechanism was more accurate than previously thought.
In 2018, based on the CT scans, the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project proposed changes in gearing and produced mechanical parts based on this.

In March 2021, the Antikythera Research Team at University College London, led by Freeth, published a new proposed reconstruction of the entire Antikythera Mechanism. They were able to find gears that could be shared among the gear-trains for the different planets, by using rational approximations for the synodic cycles which have small prime factors, with the factors 7 and 17 being used for more than one planet. They conclude that none of the previous models &quot;are at all compatible with all the currently known data&quot;, but their model is compatible with it.
Freeth has directed a video explaining the discovery of the synodic cycle periods and the conclusions about how the mechanism worked.

===Accuracy===

Investigations by Freeth and Jones reveal their simulated mechanism is inaccurate. The Mars pointer is up to 38° wrong in some instances (these inaccuracies occur at the nodal points of Mars&#x27; retrograde motion, and the error recedes at other locations in the orbit). This is not due to inaccuracies in gearing ratios in the mechanism, but inadequacies in the Greek theory of planetary movements. The accuracy could not have been improved until when Ptolemy published his &quot;Almagest&quot; (particularly by adding the concept of the equant to his theory), then much later by the introduction of Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion in 1609 and 1619.

In addition to theoretical accuracy, there is the issue of mechanical accuracy. Freeth and Jones note that the inevitable &quot;looseness&quot; in the mechanism due to the hand-built gears, with their triangular teeth and the frictions between gears, and in bearing surfaces, probably would have swamped the finer solar and lunar correction mechanisms built into it:

While the device may have struggled with inaccuracies, due to the triangular teeth being hand-made, the calculations used and technology implemented to create the elliptical paths of the planets and retrograde motion of the Moon and Mars, by using a clockwork-type gear train with the addition of a pin-and-slot epicyclic mechanism, predated that of the first known clocks found in antiquity in medieval Europe, by more than 1000 years. Archimedes&#x27; development of the approximate value of pi and his theory of centres of gravity, along with the steps he made towards developing the calculus, suggest the Greeks had enough mathematical knowledge beyond that of Babylonian algebra, to model the elliptical nature of planetary motion.

==Similar devices in ancient literature==

The level of refinement of the mechanism indicates that the device was not unique, and possibly required expertise built over several generations. However, such artefacts were commonly melted down for the value of the bronze and rarely survive to the present day.

=== Roman world ===

Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De re publica (54-51 BC)&quot;, a first century BC philosophical dialogue, mentions two machines that some modern authors consider as some kind of planetarium or orrery, predicting the movements of the Sun, the Moon, and the five planets known at that time. They were both built by Archimedes and brought to Rome by the Roman general Marcus Claudius Marcellus after the death of Archimedes at the siege of Syracuse in 212 BC. Marcellus had great respect for Archimedes and one of these machines was the only item he kept from the siege (the second was placed in the Temple of Virtue). The device was kept as a family heirloom, and Cicero has Philus (one of the participants in a conversation that Cicero imagined had taken place in a villa belonging to Scipio Aemilianus in the year 129 BC) saying that Gaius Sulpicius Gallus (consul with Marcellus&#x27;s nephew in 166 BC, and credited by Pliny the Elder as the first Roman to have written a book explaining solar and lunar eclipses) gave both a &quot;learned explanation&quot; and a working demonstration of the device.

Pappus of Alexandria (290 – ) stated that Archimedes had written a now lost manuscript on the construction of these devices titled &quot;On Sphere-Making&quot;. The surviving texts from ancient times describe many of his creations, some even containing simple drawings. One such device is his odometer, the exact model later used by the Romans to place their mile markers (described by Vitruvius, Heron of Alexandria and in the time of Emperor Commodus). The drawings in the text appeared functional, but attempts to build them as pictured had failed. When the gears pictured, which had square teeth, were replaced with gears of the type in the Antikythera mechanism, which were angled, the device was perfectly functional.

If Cicero&#x27;s account is correct, then this technology existed as early as the third century BC. Archimedes&#x27; device is also mentioned by later Roman era writers such as Lactantius (&quot;Divinarum Institutionum Libri VII&quot;), Claudian (&quot;In sphaeram Archimedes&quot;), and Proclus (&quot;Commentary on the first book of Euclid&#x27;s Elements of Geometry&quot;) in the fourth and fifth centuries.

Cicero also said that another such device was built &quot;recently&quot; by his friend Posidonius, &quot;... each one of the revolutions of which brings about the same movement in the Sun and Moon and five wandering stars [planets] as is brought about each day and night in the heavens ...&quot;

It is unlikely that any one of these machines was the Antikythera mechanism found in the shipwreck since both the devices fabricated by Archimedes and mentioned by Cicero were located in Rome at least 30 years later than the estimated date of the shipwreck, and the third device was almost certainly in the hands of Posidonius by that date. The scientists who have reconstructed the Antikythera mechanism also agree that it was too sophisticated to have been a unique device.

=== Eastern Mediterranean and others ===
This evidence that the Antikythera mechanism was not unique adds support to the idea that there was an ancient Greek tradition of complex mechanical technology that was later, at least in part, transmitted to the Byzantine and Islamic worlds, where mechanical devices which were complex, albeit simpler than the Antikythera mechanism, were built during the Middle Ages. Fragments of a geared calendar attached to a sundial, from the fifth or sixth century Byzantine Empire, have been found; the calendar may have been used to assist in telling time. In the Islamic world, Banū Mūsā&#x27;s &quot;Kitab al-Hiyal&quot;, or &quot;Book of Ingenious Devices&quot;, was commissioned by the Caliph of Baghdad in the early 9th century AD. This text described over a hundred mechanical devices, some of which may date back to ancient Greek texts preserved in monasteries. A geared calendar similar to the Byzantine device was described by the scientist al-Biruni around 1000, and a surviving 13th-century astrolabe also contains a similar clockwork device. It is possible that this medieval technology may have been transmitted to Europe and contributed to the development of mechanical clocks there.

In the 11th century, Chinese polymath Su Song constructed a mechanical clock tower that told (among other measurements) the position of some stars and planets, which were shown on a mechanically rotated armillary sphere.

== Popular culture and museum replicas ==
Several exhibitions have been staged worldwide, leading to the main &quot;Antikythera shipwreck&quot; exhibition at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens. , the Antikythera mechanism was displayed as part of a temporary exhibition about the Antikythera shipwreck, accompanied by reconstructions made by Ioannis Theofanidis, Derek de Solla Price, Michael Wright, the Thessaloniki University and Dionysios Kriaris. Other reconstructions are on display at the American Computer Museum in Bozeman, Montana, at the Children&#x27;s Museum of Manhattan in New York, at Astronomisch-Physikalisches Kabinett in Kassel, Germany, at the Archimedes Museum in Olympia, Greece, at the Kotsanas Museum of Ancient Greek Technology in Athens and at the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris.

The National Geographic documentary series &quot;Naked Science&quot; dedicated an episode to the Antikythera Mechanism entitled &quot;Star Clock BC&quot; that aired on 20 January 2011. A documentary, &quot;The World&#x27;s First Computer&quot;, was produced in 2012 by the Antikythera mechanism researcher and film-maker Tony Freeth. In 2012, BBC Four aired &quot;The Two-Thousand-Year-Old Computer&quot;; it was also aired on 3 April 2013 in the United States on &quot;NOVA&quot;, the PBS science series, under the name &quot;Ancient Computer&quot;. It documents the discovery and 2005 investigation of the mechanism by the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project.

A functioning Lego reconstruction of the Antikythera mechanism was built in 2010 by hobbyist Andy Carol, and featured in a short film produced by Small Mammal in 2011.

On 17 May 2017, Google marked the 115th anniversary of the discovery with a Google Doodle.

The YouTube channel Clickspring documents the creation of an Antikythera mechanism replica using the tools, techniques of machining and metallurgy, and materials that would have been available in ancient Greece, along with investigations into the possible technologies of the era.

The film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot; (2023) features a plot around a fictionalized version of the mechanism (also referred to as Archimedes&#x27; Dial, the titular Dial of Destiny). In the film, the device was built by Archimedes as a temporal mapping system, and sought by a former Nazi scientist as a way to detect time portals in order to travel back in time and help Germany win World War II. A major plot point revolves around the fact that the device did not take Continental drift into account as the theory was unknown in Archimedes&#x27; time.

On 8 February 2024, a 10X scale replica of the mechanism was built, installed, and inaugurated at the University of Sonora in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. With the name of Monumental Antikythera Mechanism for Hermosillo (MAMH), Dr. Alfonso performed the inauguration. Also attending were Durazo Montaño, Governor of Sonora and Dr. Maria Rita Plancarte Martinez, Chancellor of the Universidad de Sonora, the Ambassador of Greece, Nikolaos Koutrokois, and a delegation from the Embassy.

<text>Clockwork refers to the inner workings of either mechanical devices called clocks and watches (where it is also called the movement) or other mechanisms that work similarly, using a series of gears driven by a spring or weight.

A clockwork mechanism is often powered by a clockwork motor consisting of a mainspring, a spiral torsion spring of metal ribbon. Energy is stored in the mainspring manually by &quot;winding it up&quot;, turning a key attached to a ratchet which twists the mainspring tighter. Then the force of the mainspring turns the clockwork gears, until the stored energy is used up. The adjectives &quot;wind-up&quot; and &quot;spring-powered&quot; refer to mainspring-powered clockwork devices, which include clocks and watches, kitchen timers, music boxes, and wind-up toys.

==History==
The earliest known example of a clockwork set-up is the Antikythera mechanism. This device functioned as a geared analogue computer after its creation during the first-century BCE timeframe, being somewhat astrolabe-like, and had been designed for calculating astronomical positions and particularly listing eclipses. Recovered from a Greek shipwreck a long while after its creation, its nature was a mystery after its initial rediscovery due to various points of damage. There are many other accounts of clockwork devices in Ancient Greece, even in its mythology, and said mechanism itself is sophisticated enough to indicate a significant history of lesser devices leading up to its creation.

At some point, this level of sophistication in clockwork technology was lost or forgotten in Europe, and only returned when brought from the Islamic world after the Crusades, along with other knowledge leading to the Renaissance. Clockwork finally recovered the equivalent of pre-Roman technological levels in the 14th century.

As in Greek mythology, there are ambitious automation claims in the legends of other cultures. For example, in Jewish legend, Solomon used his wisdom to design a throne with mechanical animals which hailed him as king when he ascended it; upon sitting down an eagle would place a crown upon his head, and a dove would bring him a Torah scroll. It&#x27;s also said that when King Solomon stepped upon the throne, a mechanism was set in motion. As soon as he stepped upon the first step, a golden ox and a golden lion each stretched out one foot to support him and help him rise to the next step. On each side, the animals helped the King up until he was comfortably seated upon his throne.

In ancient China, a curious account of automation is found in the Lie Zi text, written in the 3rd century BC. Within it, there is a description of a much earlier encounter between King Mu of Zhou (1023-957 BC) and a mechanical engineer known as Yan Shi, an &#x27;artificer&#x27;. The latter proudly presented the king with a life-size, human-shaped figure of his mechanical handiwork (Wade-Giles spelling):
The king stared at the figure in astonishment. It walked with rapid strides, moving its head up and down, so that anyone would have taken it for a live human being. The artificer touched its chin, and it began singing, perfectly in tune. He touched its hand, and it began posturing, keeping perfect time...As the performance was drawing to an end, the robot winked its eye and made advances to the ladies in attendance, whereupon the king became incensed and would have had Yen Shih [Yan Shi] executed on the spot had not the latter, in mortal fear, instantly taken the robot to pieces to let him see what it really was. And, indeed, it turned out to be only a construction of leather, wood, glue and lacquer, variously coloured white, black, red and blue. Examining it closely, the king found all the internal organs complete—liver, gall, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, stomach and intestines; and over these again, muscles, bones and limbs with their joints, skin, teeth and hair, all of them artificial...The king tried the effect of taking away the heart, and found that the mouth could no longer speak; he took away the liver and the eyes could no longer see; he took away the kidneys and the legs lost their power of locomotion. The king was delighted.
Other notable examples include Archytas&#x27;s dove, mentioned by Aulus Gellius. Similar Chinese accounts of flying automata are written of the 5th century BC Mohist philosopher Mozi and his contemporary Lu Ban, who made artificial wooden birds (&quot;ma yuan&quot;) that could successfully fly, according to the &quot;Han Fei Zi&quot; and other texts.

By the 11th century, clockwork was used for both timepieces and to track astronomical events, in Europe. The clocks did not keep time very accurately by modern standards, but the astronomical devices were carefully used to predict the positions of planets and other movement. The same timeline seems to apply in Europe, where mechanical escapements were used in clocks by that time.

Up to the 15th century, clockwork was driven by water, weights, or other roundabout, relatively primitive means, but in 1430 a clock was presented to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, that was driven by a spring. This became a standard technology along with weight-driven movements. In the mid-16th century, Christiaan Huygens took an idea from Galileo Galilei and developed it into the first modern pendulum mechanism. However, whereas the spring or the weight provided the motive power, the pendulum merely controlled the rate of release of that power via some escape mechanism (an escapement) at a regulated rate.

The Smithsonian Institution has in its collection a clockwork monk, about high, possibly dating as early as 1560. The monk is driven by a key-wound spring and walks the path of a square, striking his chest with his right arm, while raising and lowering a small wooden cross and rosary in his left hand, turning and nodding his head, rolling his eyes, and mouthing silent obsequies. From time to time, he brings the cross to his lips and kisses it. It is believed that the monk was manufactured by Juanelo Turriano, mechanician to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.

==Overview==

The stored amounts of energy used by a given piece during its operation is often housed within it; this frequently happens via a winding device that applies mechanical stress to an energy-storage mechanism such as a mainspring, thus involving some form of escapement. In other cases, hand power may be utilized. The use of wheels, whether linked by friction or by gear teeth, to redirect motion, gain speed, or involve torque, is typical; many clockwork mechanisms have been constructed primarily to serve as visible or implicit &quot;tours de force&quot; of mechanical ingenuity in this area. Sometimes, clocks and timing mechanisms are used to set off alarm noises or trigger explosives as well as to otherwise activate some other entity.

==Examples==
The most common examples are mechanical clocks and watches. Other uses, most but not all obsolete, include:
* Wind-up toys – often as a simple mechanical motor, or to create automata. These may be either key-wound, as were many 20th-century model trains, or a simpler pullback motor.
* Most photographic camera leaf shutters use a clockwork mechanism not unlike that of wristwatches to time the opening and closing of the shutter blades.
* Mechanisms to turn the lens of lighthouses before electric motors.
* Mechanical calculators, used before small electronic calculators became available in the 1970s. Relatively small calculators were used, for example, for companies&#x27; financial calculations. 
* Mechanical computers, much more complex and larger than mechanical calculators, such as Babbage&#x27;s difference and analytical engines.
* Astronomical models, such as orreries whose history spans hundreds of years.
* Music boxes, which were very popular during the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th.
* Almost all musical record-playing phonographs (gramophones) built before the 1930s.
* Hand-powered electrical equipment, such as a clockwork radio, where an energy-storing spring accounting for much of the size and weight of the device rotates a much smaller electric generator; such equipment is very popular where batteries and mains power (house current) are scarce.

<doc id="89741" wikidata="Q1186917" url="?curid=89741" title="Strasburg, Pennsylvania">
<text>Strasburg is a borough in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. It developed as a linear village stretching approximately along the Great Conestoga Road, later known as the Strasburg Road. The population was 3,117 at the 2020 census.
The town was named after the then German city of Strasbourg, (today part of France) the native home of an early settler.
The town is often called &quot;Train Town USA&quot; because of the many railroad attractions in and around town, including the Strasburg Rail Road and the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania. Much of the movie &quot;Witness&quot; was filmed on a farm nearby. Much of the borough was listed as a historic district by the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

==History==

The Old Conestoga Road was in use by 1714, and by 1750 a tavern and some log houses were built near the current site of Strasburg. The community grew as regional trade with Philadelphia grew. By 1759, there were 32 taxable properties in the town, including about ten hotels. Many early settlers were Huguenots or Swiss or German Mennonites, and several church congregations of various faiths formed during the 1760s. The first church was built in 1807 by Methodists.

The Old Conestoga Road was the main path connecting Philadelphia with areas to the west, but in 1792 the new Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike was built, bypassing Strasburg to the north. However, in 1793 construction on the new Strasburg Road started, roughly following the old road, passing through West Chester on the way to Philadelphia. It attracted traffic because it was not a toll road, unlike the Philadelphia Turnpike. This road later developed into Pennsylvania Route 741.

By 1815, there were 90 houses in Strasburg, about half of which were two stories, indicating a relatively well-off population. There were 53 log, 29 brick, and four limestone houses. About half of the log houses survive today, as well as 12 of the brick houses and all four of the stone houses. About 150 other houses stand in the historic district, nearly all built before 1900.

==Geography==
Strasburg is located in central Lancaster County at (39.982300, -76.182713). Pennsylvania Route 741 (Main Street) passes through the center of the borough, leading east to Gap and west to Willow Street. Pennsylvania Route 896 crosses the northeast side of Strasburg; it leads north to U.S. Route 30 and southeast to U.S. Route 1. Lancaster, the county seat, is northwest of Strasburg.

<text>Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh (5 November 1864 – 7 January 1933) was a British artist who worked in Scotland, and whose design work became one of the defining features of the Glasgow Style during the 1890s to 1900s.

==Biography==
Born Margaret Macdonald, at Tipton, Staffordshire between Birmingham and Wolverhampton, her father was a colliery manager and engineer. Margaret and her younger sister Frances both attended the Orme Girls&#x27; School, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire; their names are recorded in the school register. In the 1881 census Margaret, aged 16, was a visitor at someone else&#x27;s house on census night and was listed as a scholar. By 1890, the family had settled in Glasgow and Margaret and her sister, Frances Macdonald, enrolled as day students at the Glasgow School of Art studying courses in design. There, she worked with a variety of media, including metalwork, embroidery, and textiles. Additionally, she joined other groups, such as the Scottish Society of Watercolour Painters in 1898.

She began collaborating with her sister Frances, and in 1896 the pair worked from their studio at 128 Hope Street, Glasgow, where they produced book illustrations, embroidery, &quot;gesso&quot; panels, leaded glass and &quot;repoussé&quot; metalwork. Their innovative work was inspired by Celtic imagery, literature, symbolism, and folklore. Margaret later collaborated with her husband, the architect and designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh, whom she married on 22 August 1900. Her most well-known works are the gesso panels made for interiors designed with Charles, such as tearooms and private residences.

Charles Rennie Mackintosh is frequently claimed to be Scotland&#x27;s most famous architect. Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh was somewhat marginalised in comparison. Yet she was celebrated in her time by many of her peers, including her husband who once wrote in a letter to her, &quot;Remember, you are half if not three-quarters in all my architectural work ...&quot;; and reportedly &quot;Margaret has genius, I have only talent.&quot;

Active and recognised during her career, between 1895 and 1924 she contributed to more than 40 European and American exhibitions. Poor health cut short Margaret&#x27;s career and, as far as is known, she produced no work after 1921. She died in 1933.

==The Glasgow Four==
It is unclear exactly when the Macdonald sisters met Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his friend/colleague Herbert MacNair, but they probably met around 1892 at the Glasgow School of Art (Mackintosh and MacNair were studying as night students), introduced by the Headmaster Francis Newbery because he recognised that they were working in similar styles. By 1894, they were showing their work together in student exhibitions, some of which was made collaboratively. Reception of the work was mixed, and it was commented that the gaunt, linear forms of the Macdonald sisters&#x27; artwork – clearly showing the influence of Aubrey Beardsley – were &#x27;ghoulish&#x27; and earned them the moniker &#x27;The Spook School&#x27;. They became known locally as &quot;The Four&quot;.

Most collaborative work in the 1890s was with her sister, particularly following the opening of their studio in 1896. Some works were made by both together, while others were series of works, such as a set of four paintings with repoussé frames on the seasons where each two works on the theme. They also created a set of illustrations for William Morris&#x27; &quot;Defence of Guenevere&quot; that was recently re-discovered in a special collections of the University at Buffalo.

She created several important interior schemes with her husband, including work at the home of her brother Charles at Dunglass. Many of these were executed at the early part of the 20th century; and include the &quot;Rose Boudoir&quot; at the International Exhibition at Turin in 1903, the designs for House for an Art Lover in 1900, and the Willow Tearooms in 1902. She exhibited with Mackintosh at the 1900 Vienna Secession, where she was an influence on the Secessionists Gustav Klimt and Josef Hoffmann. They continued to be popular in the Viennese art scene, both exhibiting at the Viennese International Art Exhibit in 1909.

In 1902, the couple received a major Viennese commission: Fritz Waerndorfer, the initial financer of the Wiener Werkstätte, was building a new villa outside Vienna showcasing the work of many local architects. Hoffmann and Koloman Moser were already designing two of its rooms; he invited the Mackintoshes to design the music room. That room was decorated with panels of Margaret&#x27;s art: the &quot;Opera of the Winds&quot;, the &quot;Opera of the Seas&quot;, and the &quot;Seven Princesses&quot;, a new wall-sized triptych considered by some to be her finest work. This collaboration was described by contemporary critic Amelia Levetus as &quot;perhaps their greatest work, for they were allowed perfectly free scope&quot;.

== Inspiration and style ==
Mackintosh did not keep sketchbooks, which reflects her reliance on imagination rather than on nature. A few sources provided significant inspiration for her works, including the Bible, the &quot;Odyssey,&quot; poems by Morris and Rossetti, and the works of Maurice Maeterlinck. Her works, along with those works of her often collaborating sister, defied her contemporaries&#x27; conceptions of art. Gleeson White wrote, &quot;With a delightfully innocent air these two sisters disclaim any attempt to acknowledge that Egyptian decoration has interested them specially. &#x27;We have no basis.&#x27; Nor do they advance any theory.&quot;

The beginning of her artistic career reflects broad strokes of experimentation. Largely drawing from her imagination, she reinterpreted traditional themes, allegories, and symbols in inventive ways. For instance, immediately following the 1896 opening of her Glasgow studio with her sister, she transformed broad ideas such as &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Summer&quot; into highly stylized human forms. Many of her works incorporate muted natural tones, elongated nude human forms, and a subtle interplay between geometric and natural motifs. Above all, her designs demonstrated a type of originality that distinguishes her from other artists of her time.

==Popular work==
Mackintosh and her husband Charles were part of the popular gesso revival, their gesso panels were shown at the eighth exhibition of the Vienna Secession in 1900. The Mackintosh-Macdonald interior designs exhibited in 1900 with their restricted colour palettes and fitted benches had an immediate impact on contemporary tastes, as the interior architecture was less lavish than earlier designs.

Her gesso panels are now on display in the Kelvingrove Museum in Glasgow. The 2017–18 restoration of The Willow Tearooms building has seen a recreation of &quot;Oh ye, all ye that walk in Willowwood&quot; installed in the original location within the Room de Luxe.

Her grandest work is the &quot;Seven Princesses&quot;, three wall-sized gesso panels showing a scene from a play by the same name, by Maurice Maeterlinck. This work was extremely popular in Vienna and its surrounding art scene. When the Waerndorfer villa was sold in 1916, it disappeared from public view for a long time. In 1990, it was rediscovered in a crate in the basement of the Museum of Applied Arts in Vienna. The gesso panels are now on permanent display in the city.

In 2008, her 1902 work &quot;The White Rose and the Red Rose&quot; was auctioned for  million ($3.3 million).

<text>AB SKF (, &#x27;Swedish Ball Bearing Factory&#x27;) is a Swedish bearing and seal manufacturing company founded in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1907. The company manufactures and supplies bearings, seals, lubrication and lubrication systems, maintenance products, mechatronics products, power transmission products, condition monitoring systems and related services globally.

SKF is the world&#x27;s largest bearing manufacturer and employs 44,000 people in 108 manufacturing units. It has the largest industrial distributor network in the industry, with 17,000 distributor locations encompassing 130 countries. SKF is one of the largest companies in Sweden and among the largest public companies in the world.

==History==

=== Invention of ball and roller bearings ===
The development of SKF is a significant part of the Swedish and global machine industry development. AB SKF was established in Gothenburg in 1907 with the initial capital and startup project for ball bearing manufacturing of Gamlestadens Fabriker AB, under the guidance of co-owners and members of the board Axel Carlander and Knut Johansson Mark, following the invention of the spherical ball bearing by engineer Sven Gustaf Wingquist. He was an operations engineer in Gamlestadens Fabriker AB and was then appointed CEO and technical manager in SKF. Industrialist Axel Carlander was the first chairman of the board of SKF from 1907 to 1937 during which time he implemented successful industrial and corporate managerial strategies for the startup and growth of SKF and the establishment of its factories outside Sweden. 

Historically, the machine industry development and industrial production of innovative technical models depend on both engineering and industrial leaders, on the base of their educational, research and professional experience. In this context, the startup and growth of SKF has become possible due to the engineering experience and inventions of Sven Wingquist and the industrial managerial experience and strategies of Axel Carlander.

Sven Wingqvist, at the time a thirty-year-old plant engineer responsible for repairs and maintenance at Gamlestadens Fabriker, was dissatisfied with the performance of the ball bearings then in use. In spring 1907, Wingquist presented a breakthrough: a double row self-aligning ball bearing with a spherical raceway in the outer ring, shared by both rows of balls. This allowed the inner ring to align freely in relation to the outer ring, with no negative impact on the function of the bearing. The new bearing solved the problem associated with misalignment of the shafts and thus did away with the frequent production stops. Self-alignment was particularly useful in the less-than-perfect machinery of the times and in buildings with subsidence problems, which was the case at Gamlestadens Fabriker, since much of the land on which Gothenburg has been built is clay.

On 16 February 1907, Wingqvist applied for Swedish patent No. 25406, a multi-row self-aligning radial ball bearing. The Patent was granted on 6 June in Sweden coinciding with patents in 10 other countries. The new ball bearing was successful from the outset. Three years after SKF was founded, the company had 325 employees and a subsidiary in the United Kingdom. Manufacturing operations were later established in multiple countries.

In 1906, Sven Wingquist patented the self-aligning ball bearing, and in 1907, the multi-row self-regulating radial ball bearing (spherical ball bearing). He graduated Örebro Technical Elementary School in 1894, whereafter he started working as an engineer in Swedish textile factories, respectively Jonsereds Fabriker AB from 1896 to 1899 and Gamlestadens Fabriker AD from 1899 onwards. As an operations engineer responsible for repairs and maintenance at Gamlestadens Fabriker AD he sought opportunities to improve the efficiency and endurance of the ball bearings used at the time. Due to that, he was interested in a comparative study from 1902 about ball and plain bearings by professor Richard Stribeck of the Institute of Technology in Dresden, Germany. Sven Wingquist invented the first design of combined self-aligning spherical ball bearing. It was a revolutionary upgrade of the first ball bearing design which was invented and patented by Welsh iron-maker Philip Vaughan in 1794 and the first design of self-aligning spherical plain bearing which was invented by Scottish engineer James Nasmyth around 1840. The historical development of the bearing’s design is a result of revolutionary inventions and upgrades for improvement of their efficiency and endurance as well as broadening the scope of their application to a variety of machine industry sectors.

In 1917–1919 Arvid Palmgren, who started working as a research engineer in SKF, invented and patented the first design of the double-row self-aligning roller bearing (spherical roller bearing), the production of which continues to this day. He graduated in civil engineering at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm in 1916 and became a Doctor of Technology in 1930 with dissertation thesis on the capacity of ball bearings. 

=== Initial growth and expansion ===
The startup and growth of SKF depends not only on technical inventions but also on industrial and corporate management strategies and power. Axel Carlander was a co-founder of SKF as a co-owner and member of the board of Gamlestadens Fabriker AB, which corporate policy provided conditions for experimenting with the new bearing models and the startup of SKF, and also he was the first chairman of the board of SKF who applied successful managerial strategies to the company startup and its development during the first 30 years. He graduated from the Gothenburg Trade Institute in 1886 and he is second generation industrialist with education and significant managerial experience in the field of economics, trade and industry. He developed his industrial and corporate strategies as co-founder and chairmen of the board of leading companies in Gothenburg, as co-owner and board member of the trade and textile company Johansson &amp; Carlander and Gamlestadens Fabriker AB; co-founder and first chairmen of the board of SKF (1907– ); co-founder and first chairman of the board of shipping companies Swedish American Mexico Line ‘SAML’ (1911– ) and Swedish American Line ‘SAL’ (1914– ); board member of AB Volvo (1917– ); chairman of the City Council (1923– ); co-founder, donor and first chairman of Carlanderska hospital (1927– ), as well as board member of other companies, banks, associations and foundations established for the benefit of business and society. SKF grew as a global company because of his successful industrial and corporate managerial strategies for its startup and growth during the first 30 years - for example in 1930 the company had 12 factories with 21,000 employees, two-thirds outside Sweden. 

The main corporate strategies of SKF have always been focused on the development and maintenance of the manufactured bearings and the manufacturing bases. As an exception, in 1917 AB Volvo was established at SKF to construct an innovative type of car with the implementation of new bearings. In 1926, the subsidiary automobile company Volvo was founded as an engineering project by Assar Gabrielsson, Bjorn Prytz and Gustaf Larson, and separated as an independent company in 1935. With this innovative startup project, SKF once again contributed to the Swedish and global machine industry development. 

Axel Carlander was CEO of SKF from 1907 to 1937 and died in 1939. Sven Wingqvist was CEO of SKF from 1938 to 1953. Sven Wingqvist and Marcus Wallenberg were co-founders of Svenska Aeroplane Aktiebolaget (SAAB AB). 

By 1912, SKF was represented in 32 countries and by 1930, a staff of over 21,000 were employed in 12 manufacturing facilities worldwide with the largest in Philadelphia, United States. 

SKF began its operations in India in 1923 by establishing a trading outpost in Calcutta. The early operations involved the importing of automotive bearings. SKF India Ltd was incorporated in 1961 following a collaboration between AB SKF, Associated Bearing Co. Ltd and Investment Corp. of India Ltd. In 1963, SKF set up its first bearing factory in Pune, Maharashtra.

Assar Gabrielsson, SKF sales manager, and Björn Prytz, Managing Director of SKF, were the founders of Volvo AB in 1926. In the beginning, the company functioned as a subsidiary automobile company within the SKF group. SKF funded the production run of the first thousand cars, built at Hisingen in Gothenburg, beginning in 1927. SKF used one of the company&#x27;s trademarked names: AB Volvo, which derives from the Latin &quot;I roll&quot;, with its obvious connotations of bearings in motion. The ownership of Volvo lasted until 1935, when the last shares were divested.

=== World War II to the present day ===
During the Second World War, Sven Wingvist was CEO of SKF and Jacob Wallenberg was member of the company&#x27;s board of SKF directors. The Wallenberg-owned ball-bearing multinational, SKF, supplied the German military with ball-bearings and ball-bearing machines, and had a monopoly on it in Europe. SKF also supplied the Allies with ball-bearings. SKF&#x27;s ball-bearings were Sweden&#x27;s most important strategic contribution to German war production. In the spring of 1944, the Swedish government, along with the Wallenbergs, promised the Allies that the export of ball-bearings would cease. However, SKF continued to export. When this could not be done legally, the ball-bearings were smuggled to Germany. As late as 1945, SKF sold ball-bearing steel and ball-bearing machines to Hitler. It has been estimated that the supply of ball-bearings prolonged World War II by two years. SKF actively worked to cut off the supply of ball-bearings to the defense industry in the US and instead supplied products from its American factories to Nazi Germany through subsidiaries in South America. 

In order to expand its international business, SKF decided in 1966 it needed to use the English language. Senior officials, although mostly still Swedish, all learned English in all major internal documents were in English, the lingua franca of multinational corporations. In the 1970s SKF embarked on a massive production rationalisation program in Europe. A visionary project, &quot;Production Concept for the 80s&quot; was launched with the aim to run the night shifts practically unmanned. To increase productivity and safeguard the product quality, a continuous, automatic flow of bearing rings was needed, so SKF developed the FlexLink brand. FlexLink created the multiflex plastic chain conveyor system to solve the business requirements. SKF divested FlexLink as a separate company in 1997.

Today, SKF Group continues to be a global leader in the manufacture and maintenance of increasingly advanced bearings, such as the SKF Explorer and SKF Energy Efficient (E2).
