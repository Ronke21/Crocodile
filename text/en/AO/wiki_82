<text>Davidson County is a county located in the U.S. state of North Carolina. As of the 2020 census, the population was 168,930. Its county seat is Lexington, and its largest community is Thomasville.

Davidson County is included in the Winston-Salem, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Greensboro–Winston-Salem–High Point, NC Combined Statistical Area.

Parts of Davidson County are in the Yadkin Valley AVA.

==History==

The original North Carolina county of this name was created in 1786 what was then the far western portion of North Carolina, with its county seat at Nashville and a territory covering most of what is now Middle Tennessee. When Tennessee was established as a separate state in 1796, this county became Davidson County, Tennessee.

The current North Carolina county was formed in 1822 from Rowan County. It was named after Brigadier General William Lee Davidson, an American Revolutionary War general killed at the Battle of Cowan&#x27;s Ford on the Catawba River in 1781.

The Silver Hill Mine, the first silver mine in the United States, opened in Davidson County in 1839.

In 1911, a new county called Piedmont County was proposed, with High Point as its county seat, to be created from Guilford, Davidson and Randolph Counties. Many people appeared at the Guilford County courthouse to oppose the plan, vowing to go to the state legislature to protest. The state legislature voted down the plan in February 1911.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.56%) is water.

Davidson County is located entirely within the Piedmont region of central North Carolina. The Piedmont consists of gently rolling terrain frequently broken by hills or shallow valleys formed by rivers and streams. An exception to this terrain are the Uwharrie Mountains in the county&#x27;s western and southwestern sections. The Uwharries are the oldest mountain range in North America, and at one time they rose to nearly above sea level. However, time has worn them down to little more than high hills; yet due to the relative flatness of the surrounding countryside they still rise from 250 to above their base. The highest point in the Uwharries - and the highest point in Davidson County - is High Rock Mountain in the county&#x27;s southwestern corner. It has an elevation of above sea level.

Most of the county consists of a string of resort communities along the Outer Banks. While lightly populated by year-round residents, the population swells during the summer with vacationers.

At one time, the now-abandoned town of Buffalo City was the largest community in the county.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (75.14%) is water. It is the largest county in North Carolina by total area.

Currituck never voted Republican until, after voting for American Independent George Wallace in 1968, turning decisively to Richard Nixon in 1972.

The last Democrat to carry Currituck has been Jimmy Carter in 1980, and at the 2016 election Hillary Clinton received less than a quarter of the county&#x27;s vote.

The county is run by elected county commissioners, and Currituck County is a member of the Albemarle Commission regional council of governments. Currituck has recently paced all other counties in growth throughout North Carolina, as commuters from the Hampton Roads metro of Virginia as well as work-from-home employees have flocked to the county. The Currituck County Board of Commissioners placed a moratorium on solar farms in February 2017, but have since rescinded it with two new solar projects in the works as of 2023.

<text>In Inuit folklore, the kăk-whăn’-û-ghăt kǐg-û-lu’-nǐk or akh’lut is an orca-like composite animal that takes the form of a wolf when on land, and is sometimes depicted as a wolf-orca hybrid.

==Inuit folklore==
In 1900, the American naturalist Edward William Nelson described the &quot;kăk-whăn’-û-ghăt kǐg-û-lu’-nǐk&quot; among a number of other mythical and composite animals:

Nelson attributed stories of the creature to the orca (&quot;akh’lut&quot;), and explained wolf tracks appearing to lead into the sea as the result of ice breaking away from the edge. He identifies other composite animals among Inuit folklore, including a white whale that can transform into a reindeer, and says that belief in the kăk-whăn’-û-ghăt kǐg-û-lu’-nǐk is prevalent among Inuit along the shore of the Bering Sea. 

More recent collections of myths and folklore have used the term Nelson gives for the orca, &quot;akh’lut&quot;, to describe the composite animal.

<text>Craven County is a county located in the U.S. state of North Carolina. As of the 2020 census, the population was 100,720. Its county seat is New Bern. The county was created in 1705 as Archdale Precinct from the now-extinct Bath County. It was renamed Craven Precinct in 1712 and gained county status in 1739. It is named for William, Earl of Craven, who lived from 1606 to 1697. Craven County is part of the New Bern, NC Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
===Early history===
On August 4, 1661, George Durant purchased land from Cisketando, king of the Yeopim Indian tribe. On March 13, 1662, a second purchase was made from Kilcocanen, another Yeopim. By 1662 Durant was living in Virginia on a tract of land along the Perquimans River which flows into Albemarle Sound, which became part of the Carolina colony in 1665.

===Creation===
The land eventually constituting Craven was first organized as a portion of Bath County. On December 3, 1705, a portion of Bath was split off to form the new Archdale County. In about 1712 it was renamed Craven County. According to historian William S. Powell, it was most likely named in honor of William, Lord Craven a lord proprietor of the Carolina colony who died the previous year. Others state that the county was named for William&#x27;s great uncle, William, Earl of Craven, who was one of the original eight lords proprietor of the colony, or the Lord Craven&#x27;s son, also William, Lord Craven, who was actively serving as a lord proprietor at the time the county&#x27;s name was changed. In 1722 a portion of Craven was split off to form Carteret County. New Hanover County and Johnston County were formed from Craven in 1729 and 1746, respectively. Craven&#x27;s borders were altered and redrawn several times between 1757 and 1852.

During the initial years of colonization, the population of Craven County was sparse and grew slowly. By 1740, however, the town of New Bern began growing rapidly and became the seat for the Governorship. John Carter served as the first sheriff of Craven County, but died in 1740 in the line of duty, when ambushed by an outlaw he was trying to apprehend. In 1746 an act was passed establishing New Bern as the capital of the province and, although the act was later repealed, the General Court met at New Bern in Craven County after 1747.

In 1749 James Davis, the colony&#x27;s first printer, arrived at New Bern and became the official printer for the North Carolina Assembly. In 1751, Davis established and began printing the &quot;North Carolina Gazette&quot;, North Carolina&#x27;s first newspaper. In 1754, he was elected Sheriff of Craven County.

===Antebellum period===
Craven developed an economy centered around agriculture, timber and turpentine, small manufacturing, and commerce emanating from the port of New Bern. Various fruits and vegetables were among the most popular crops, with cotton production declining in popularity after adverse weather conditions in 1821. Some cattle was also kept in the county. Commercial fishing became more common in the late 1840s, while shipbuilding declined later in the Antebellum period. Slaves served as a key labor force in the local economy, though unlike other eastern counties in the state, which had overwhelmingly rural slave populations, almost 40 percent of Craven&#x27;s slaves were kept in New Bern.

The Panic of 1819 heavily impacted the county and triggered a two decade-long period of economic contraction. Railroad service was introduced in the 1850s. The population rose from 13,394 in 1820 to 16,268 by 1860, though poverty remained a problem and many born in the country migrated elsewhere in search of better economic prospects. Despite the difficulties, Craven remained a center of political and social activity in the state and New Bern remained one of the largest cities in North Carolina throughout the antebellum period.

===Civil War===
Following North Carolina&#x27;s secession from the United States and entrance into the American Civil War on the side of the Confederate States of America in 1861, New Bern became a center for Confederate political and military activity. By March 1862, the white men of the county had formed nine permanent companies of troops and three temporary ones. Some of these forces served throughout the entire war&#x27;s duration. The Battle of Hatteras Inlet Batteries in August 1861 gave United States forces a foothold in eastern North Carolina and provoked the flight of women and children from New Bern.

===Reconstruction===
The county&#x27;s economy was heavily impacted by the Civil War with the depletion of livestock, damage of property, and the emancipation of slaves. Most food crop production also suffered, though cotton, tobacco, and rice yields increased. Lumber and naval stores industries persisted, though somewhat weakened. The conclusion of the conflict led to regained confidence in economic activity. The shipping industry in New Bern grew and several new businesses, including a bank, were established. Some black freedmen were assigned work by federal troops or enrolled into Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau schools. Most of the rest found unskilled work in the local farming, fishing, and turpentine industries. Those that entered skilled labor professions were faced with a rivalry from white contemporaries.

The advent of Congressional Reconstruction in 1867 and 1868 led to profound political changes in Craven County. General Edward Canby, the commander of the Second Military District, replaced New Bern&#x27;s municipal government and also chose the county&#x27;s sheriff. Following registration efforts, black voters outnumbered whites in the county, and remained a majority of the electorate until the end of the century. Together with local whites who had held 
Unionist sympathies before the war and recently arrived carpetbaggers, they constituted a strong base for the Republican Party. In the returns for the 1868 elections, Republicans&#x27; margin of victory was the second largest among the counties in the state. A portion of Craven was annexed to the new Pamlico County in 1872.

==Government and politics==
===Government===

Craven County is led by a seven-member board of commissioners, each of whom are elected to represent a district.

Craven County is a member of the Eastern Carolina Council of Governments, a regional multi-county planning and economic coordination body. It is located in the North Carolina Senate&#x27;s 2nd district and the North Carolina House of Representatives&#x27; 3rd district, and 13th district.

Craven County lies within the bounds of the 4th Prosecutorial District, the 3B Superior Court District, and the 3B District Court District.

=== Judicial system and law enforcement ===
Craven County lies within the bounds of North Carolina&#x27;s 4th Prosecutorial District, the 4th Superior Court District, and the 4th District Court District. The Craven County Sheriff&#x27;s Office provides law enforcement services for the county, as well as operating the Craven County Detention Center.

=== 2025 Craven County Jail escape ===
In January 2025, John Matthew Nigh, an inmate at the Craven County Jail, escaped from the facility. Nigh was being held in custody on multiple felony charges, including three counts of attempted murder on law enforcement officers in nearby Onslow County. Nigh was assisted in his escape by two cellmates, as they removed a ceiling grating and stuffed a mattress to make it appear to correctional officers that Nigh was sleeping in his cell. Nigh then exited the facility through a ventilation housing. Within 12 hours of the escape, he was detected absent from his cell, and a manhunt ensued. As of February 6, 2025, Nigh has not been located. Law enforcement agencies from the counties of Carteret, Craven, Lenoir, Martin, Nash, Onslow, Pamlico, and Pitt are assisting in the search. The United States Marshals Service is also assisting in search efforts. All North Carolina law enforcement agencies have been notified of his escape.

===Politics===














Craven is a typical “Solid South” county in its presidential voting patterns. It was solidly Democratic until the 1960s: in five elections from 1932 to 1948 the Republican Party did not reach fifteen percent of the vote, and only in 1928 when a large anti-Catholic vote was cast against Al Smith did the GOP reach twenty percent between at least 1900 and 1948. The national Democratic party&#x27;s support for the Civil Rights Movement caused its white electorate to defect to George Wallace’s American Independent campaign in 1968. Since that time, Craven has become a strongly Republican county. The last Democrat to carry Craven County was Jimmy Carter in 1976. As of March 2022, there were 70,286 registered voters in the county. Of those, 26,225 were registered Republican, 20,135 were registered Democrats, and 23,393 registered unaffiliated.

<text>Columbus County is a county located in the U.S. state of North Carolina. Its county seat is Whiteville. At the 2020 census, the population was 50,623.

==History==
===Early history===
The area comprising Columbus County was originally inhabited by the Waccamaw people. Historically, the &quot;eastern Siouans&quot; had territories extending through the area of Columbus County prior to any European exploration or settlement in the 16th century.

English colonial settlement in what was known as Carolina did not increase until the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Following epidemics of new infectious diseases, to which indigenous peoples were exposed in trading and other contact, the Waccamaw and other Native Americans often suffered disruption and fatalities when caught between larger tribes and colonists in the Tuscarora and Yamasee wars. Afterward most of the Tuscarora people migrated north, joining other Iroquoian-speaking peoples of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy in New York State by 1722. At that point the leaders declared their migration ended and the tribe officially relocated to that area.

The Waccamaw Siouan ancestors retreated for safety to an area of Green Swamp near Lake Waccamaw. Throughout the 19th century, the Waccamaw Siouan were seldom mentioned in the historical record. If descendants intermarried with whites and/or African Americans, their children were assumed to lose their Indian status, although they were often reared in Indian culture. Since North Carolina was a slave society, whites classified anyone with visible African features as slaves and blacks first.

===Colonial settlement===
As America was colonized by the British, the area encompassing Columbus County was first organized part of the Bath Precinct of North Carolina, established by the British Crown in 1696. In 1729 a southern portion was split off by the General Assembly to create New Hanover County, and five years later Bladen was formed out of part of New Hanover. In 1764 Brunswick County was formed out of Bladen and New Hanover. Throughout this time the area was largely forested and had few white settlers, though the General Assembly established two roads through the area in 1764. William Bartram, a botanist from Pennsylvania, journeyed to Lake Waccamaw to study the flora and fauna of the region in the 1730s, creating the first detailed written account of the area. At least two skirmishes of the American Revolutionary War were fought on Columbus soil: one near Pireway and another at Brown Marsh.

===Creation===
Columbus County was created by the General Assembly on December 15, 1808, to make it easier for local residents to conduct official business without having to travel to the seat of Brunswick County. Columbus was formed from parts of Bladen and Brunswick counties and named in honor of Christopher Columbus. The county&#x27;s borders were modified several times by legislative act between 1809 and 1821. In 1810, a community was platted on land owned by James B. White for the purpose of creating a county seat. It was originally known as White&#x27;s Crossing before being incorporated as Whiteville in 1832. The first courthouse and jail, made of wood, were built there in 1809.

=== Development===

At the time of its creation, Columbus County was sparsely populated. A new brick courthouse and jail were erected in 1852. The construction of a railroad along the Bladen-Columbus border in the 1860s spurred growth. The laying of the Wilmington, Columbia and Augusta Railroad later in the decade connected Whiteville with Wilmington and supported the development of strong lumber and naval stores industries. The county also produced corn, wheat, cotton, and wool.

Most white men in the county fought during the American Civil War, while most free blacks and mulattoes were exempted from service. The county was spared direct fighting, but the war demands stressed the local labor and food markets, and severe rains in 1863 diminished grain yields. Most residents resorted to trade via the barter system. After Wilmington fell to Union troops in February 1865, Union marauders sacked Whiteville. After the war Columbus&#x27; economy grew more heavily reliant on corn and cotton production. In 1877, part of Brunswick County was annexed to Columbus.

In the post-Reconstruction period, after white Democrats regained dominance in politics, they emphasized white supremacy and classified all non-whites as black. For instance, Native Americans could not attend schools for white children. Toward the end of the century, the U.S. Census recorded common Waccamaw surnames among individuals in the small isolated communities of this area.

Tobacco was introduced as a crop in Columbus in 1896, and that year a tobacco warehouse was established in Fair Bluff. It remained a marginal crop until 1914, and at the conclusion of World War I overtook cotton as the county&#x27;s major cash crop. The county&#x27;s first bank was opened in 1903. Strawberries were introduced at Chadbourn in 1895, and by 1907 Chadbourn had become one of the leading strawberry producers in the world. Another courthouse and jail were built in 1914.

===Ku Klux Klan===
In 1950 Thomas Hamilton, a South Carolina leader of a white supremacist Ku Klux Klan chapter, began a recruiting campaign to expand his organization&#x27;s reach into Columbus County, focusing on the towns of Chadbourn, Fair Bluff, Tabor City, and Whiteville. In late July they paraded through Tabor City, passing out handbills which exhorted white men to join them in resisting &quot;Jews, nigger, and integrationist quacks&quot;. W. Horace Carter, the publisher of the &quot;Tabor City Tribune&quot;, issued an editorial the following day denouncing the Klan as a violent group and urging local residents to ignore them, leading to a threatening note being placed on his car the following day. The county hosted many Klan sympathizers and a Klavern was organized later that year in Whiteville. &quot;The News Reporter&quot; of Whiteville, led by editor Willard Cole, joined the &quot;Tabor City Tribune&quot; in reporting on Klan activities and denouncing the organization, leading to threats against Cole.

The following January the Klansmen began night raids on homes, abducting and flogging residents who they felt had violated traditional mores. Over the following months the Klan continued to conduct raids, heightening local tensions. In early October 1951 Klansmen from Fair Bluff abducted a couple and transported them into South Carolina. Abduction crossing state lines was a federal crime, and as a result the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) became involved. In February 1952 the FBI, state agents, and county sheriff&#x27;s deputies initiated a crackdown and arrested 11 Klansmen responsible for the October abduction. Law enforcement made additional arrests over subsequent months. Of the near 100 Klansmen arrested, 63 including Hamilton were convicted of various crimes. For their efforts against the Klan, in 1953 the &quot;Tabor City Tribune&quot; and &quot;The News Reporter&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.

===Colcor===

By the early 1980s, Columbus County had a reputation for intense political competition marked by accusations of fraud and impropriety. The FBI had received several complaints from local police officers and residents about alleged protection rackets run by public officials and election fraud. In early 1980, a former FBI informant moved to the county and reported that he was being told to pay bribes to ensure the smooth operation of his business. Taking into account the previous complaints they had received, upon being informed, the FBI initiated an undercover investigation into corruption in Columbus County, codenamed &quot;Colcor&quot;.

FBI agents posed as corrupt businessmen with connections to the Detroit Mafia. They set up an illegal gambling club in Lake Waccamaw to make connections with locals and paid bribes to a local judge and the town&#x27;s police chief to protect their operation. The agents also paid bribes to county commission chairman Ed Walton Williamson in exchange for political influence. With Williamson&#x27;s help, the agents devised a scheme to investigate election fraud by instigating a referendum in the town of Bolton to legalize liquor-by-the-drink and supplying a local political leader with funds to buy votes to achieve their desired outcome, the first time the FBI had ever tried to manipulate a public election. The town ultimately voted in favor of legalizing liquor-by-the-drink. The agents were also asked by State Representative G. Ronald Taylor to burn down a business competitor&#x27;s property, though Taylor eventually enlisted other men to commit the arson.

The FBI publicly revealed the Colcor operation on July 29, 1982. A total of 40 people were indicted for crimes observed during the course of the investigation. Of those indicted, 38 were convicted of crimes, with many reaching plea bargains with prosecutors. The U.S. House of Representatives and the North Carolina State Board of Elections were critical of the FBI&#x27;s involvement in the vote-buying sting surrounding the liquor referendum in Bolton, with the Board of Elections ultimately nullifying the referendum.

===Economic stagnation===
The manufacturing sector in Columbus County began a decline in the 1990s. Between 1999 and 2014, the county lost about 2,000 manufacturing jobs. The number of local farmers also declined. The county was heavily impacted by Hurricane Florence in 2018.

==Geography==

Columbus County is located in southeastern North Carolina. It is bordered by Bladen County, Pender County, Brunswick County, and Robeson County in North Carolina and Horry County and Dillon County in South Carolina. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total land area of , of which is land and (1.77%) is water. It is the third-largest county in North Carolina by land area. Columbus is drained by the Lumber River and Waccamaw River. There are several large lakes within the county, including Lake Tabor and Lake Waccamaw.

One of the most significant geographic features is the Green Swamp, a 15,907-acre area in the north-eastern portion of the county. Highway 211 passes alongside it. The swamp contains several unique and endangered species, such as the venus flytrap. The area contains the Brown Marsh Swamp, and has a remnant of the giant longleaf pine forest that once stretched across the Southeast from Virginia to Texas.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===
As of the 2020 census, there were 50,623 people residing in the county. The 2020 census showed a loss of 12.9% of the population from that of 2010. In proportions, the county was racially/ethnically 59.3 percent white, 28.6 percent black, 5.8 percent Hispanic, 3.4 percent American Indian, 0.3 percent Asian, 0.2 percent Pacific Islander, 3 percent two or more races, and 0.3 percent other. Compared to state averages, the county reported higher proportions of black and American Indian residents and lower proportions of white, Asian, and Hispanic residents. Whiteville is the largest municipality.

Unlike the 2010 census, the population of incarcerated persons were included in the 2020 census. In 2020, Columbus County had an inmate prison population of approximately 2,500.

===Demographic change===
Between 2010 and 2020, Columbus County lost 7,475 residents, a population decline of 12.9 percent. The U.S. Census Bureau recorded declines in 12 of 14 reported communities. Census experts anticipate a further population decline between 2020 and 2030.

==Government and politics==
=== Government ===
Columbus County is governed by a seven-member Board of Commissioners. The county is represented in the North Carolina Senate in district 8 and in the North Carolina House of Representatives in district 46. The county is a member of the regional Cape Fear Council of Governments, where it participates in area planning on a variety of issues.

===Judicial system and law enforcement===
Columbus County lies within the bounds of North Carolina&#x27;s 15th Prosecutorial District, the 13A Superior Court District, and the 13th District Court District. The Columbus County Sheriff&#x27;s Office provides law enforcement services for the county as well as operating the Columbus County Detention Center. 

There are two state prisons within Columbus County:

* Columbus Correctional Institution in Brunswick

* Tabor City Correctional Institution in Tabor City

=== 2022 Columbus County Sheriff controversy ===
In November 2022, Sheriff Jody Greene was re-elected to office after resigning several weeks prior due to allegations of obstructing justice and racism. Immediately after his re-election, District Attorney Jon David filed a new petition for Greene&#x27;s removal from office, including a request to permanently disqualify him from elected office in Columbus County. Greene would later resign from office for the second time in January 2023. As of January 2024, a federal investigation into the actions of Sheriff Jody Greene and the Columbus County Sheriff&#x27;s Office was pending.

=== Politics ===

After the Reconstruction era, Columbus County&#x27;s politics fell under the domination of the Democratic Party. Through much of the 20th century, local primaries were the preeminent political contests, marked by intense intraparty competition. General elections often displayed low turnout. Throughout much of the 2000s, the county electorate regularly supported Republican presidential candidates and Democratic local and state candidates. Following the election of Democrat Barack Obama as U.S. president in 2008, Republicans&#x27; performance in local races markedly improved. As of 2022, the county hosts about 36,200 registered voters, comprising about 15,344 registered Democrats, 10,100 registered Republicans and 10,700 unaffiliated. Despite Democrats&#x27; registration advantage, only one unopposed Democrat was elected to a county office in the 2022 local general elections. In 2024, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won the county with 67 percent of its vote.

==Economy==
The economy of Columbus County centers on agriculture and manufacturing. Columbus farmers produce crops such as pecans and peanuts, along with soybeans, potatoes, and corn. Cattle, poultry, and catfish are other agricultural products in the county. Factories in the region produce textiles, tools, and plywood. Household products such as doors, furniture, and windows are also manufactured in Columbus. The county hosts two industrial parks and shares a third with Brunswick County. International Paper is the largest employer. According to census figures, over 14,000 Columbus residents commute to other counties for work, while about 7,600 residents work within the county. The North Carolina Department of Commerce classifies the county as economically distressed and it has regularly suffered from a higher unemployment rate than the state average.

== Transportation ==
Airplane facilities are provided by the Columbus County Municipal Airport in Whiteville. The R.J. Corman Railroad Group operates a shortline railroad in the county.

===Major highways===

==Education==
Columbus is one of the few counties in North Carolina that has two public school systems: one for the county, which mostly serves rural areas, and one for the city of Whiteville. Both are led by elected school boards. The county government maintains a system of six libraries. The county also hosts Southeastern Community College. According to the 2021 American Community Survey, an estimated 14.1 percent of county residents have attained a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher level of education.

<text>Chowan County ( ) is one of the 100 counties located in the U.S. state of North Carolina. As of the 2020 census, the population was 13,708. Its county seat is Edenton. The county was created between 1668 and 1671 as Shaftesbury Precinct and later renamed Chowan Precinct. It gained county status in 1739.

==History==
Chowan was formed in 1670 as a precinct, originally called Shaftesbury, in Albemarle County. By 1685 it had been renamed for the Chowan Indian tribe, which lived in the northeastern part of the Carolina Colony.

Chowan County is in the northeastern section of the State and is bounded by Albemarle Sound, Chowan River, and the counties of Bertie, Hertford, Gates, and Perquimans. The present land area is 172.64 square miles and the 2000 population was 14,150.

In 1720, Edenton, which was named in honor of Governor Charles Eden, was established. In 1722 it was designated, and has continued to be, the county seat.

During the American Civil War, the Albemarle Artillery was recruited in 1862 from Chowan and Tyrrell men at Edenton by local attorney William Badham, Jr. After cannons were recast from bronze donated as bells from local courthouses and churches to arm the battery, the unit was renamed the Edenton Bell Battery. They named their cannon: &quot;Columbia&quot;, &quot;St. Paul&quot;, &quot;Fannie Roulac&quot;, and &quot;Edenton&quot;. Two of the guns, long thought lost, have been returned to Edenton in recent years. The &quot;St. Paul&quot; and the &quot;Edenton&quot; now can be seen on display at Edenton&#x27;s waterfront park.
The county was named after the historical Chowanoc American Indian tribe, also called Chowan.

==Geography==

<text>Cherokee County is the westernmost county in the U.S. state of North Carolina. It borders Tennessee to its west and Georgia to its south. As of the 2020 census, the population was 28,774. The county seat is Murphy.

==History==
This area was occupied for thousands of years by indigenous peoples who settled in the river valleys. It was part of the historic Cherokee homelands, a large territory composed of areas of what are now western Virginia, western North and South Carolina, eastern Tennessee, and northeastern Georgia.

The area that would become Cherokee County was explored by Spanish conquistador Hernando DeSoto as early as 1540. In 1813, the first highway was built through the area. The Unicoi Turnpike was the first to link East Tennessee, North Georgia, and Western North Carolina. Early white farmers who wed Native Americans were granted property along the Nottley River in 1817. A Baptist mission center was established in the area as early as 1820. European Americans began to settle near present-day Murphy and a trading post was established prior to 1828.

The Old Tatham House at the base of Pisgah Road near Andrews was built in 1833. The two-story log cabin built by Thomas Tatham is the oldest surviving structure in the county. Fort Butler was built near Murphy in July 1836 and early court trials were held there. In fall 1838, the area&#x27;s land was put up for public sale in Franklin. Cherokee County was formed in 1839 from Macon County and named for the Cherokee Native Americans. A proposal to name the county Junaluska, in honor of the Cherokee leader, was rejected. The county&#x27;s first brick courthouse was constructed in 1844 in downtown Murphy. Murphy was incorporated as the county seat in 1851.

Cherokee County&#x27;s first industry, a tannery northeast of what would become Andrews, was established by James Stewart in 1852. As European-American population increased in the area in the 19th century, the state legislature created new counties. In 1861 the southeastern part of Cherokee County became Clay County. In 1872, its northeastern part was separated and organized as Graham County.

Harshaw Chapel, the oldest brick structure and church building in Cherokee County, was constructed in 1869. In the late 19th century, there was widespread interest in Native American cultures. In the 1870s, the Valentine brothers of Richmond, Virginia, caused extensive damage to at least eight ancient mounds in Cherokee, Haywood, Jackson, and Swain counties. They roughly excavated and looted them, seeking artifacts for the museum of their father, Mann S. Valentine, which he operated in Richmond.

The railroad came to Cherokee County in 1887, with Georgia &amp; North Carolina Railroad&#x27;s narrow gauge line from Marietta to Culberson – then the largest town in the county. The train reached Murphy the following year. The county&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Cherokee Scout&quot;, was founded in 1889.

===20th century to present===
The first known brick house in the county, the John Tatham House, was north of Andrews. It was destroyed in the early 1900s. The 43-inmate Cherokee County Jail was built in downtown Murphy in 1922. The current Cherokee County Courthouse was constructed next door four years later. The jail was demolished in 2008 after a new 150-inmate detention center was completed on Regal Street.

The nation&#x27;s oldest and largest folk school, John C. Campbell Folk School, was founded in southeast Cherokee County in 1925. The county&#x27;s first medical institution was Petrie Hospital, founded in November 1933 by Dr. R.W. Petrie, an eye, ear, nose, and throat specialist. The hospital was a two-story white brick building atop a hill on Peachtree Street in downtown Murphy. It started with four registered nurses and a capacity of 21 patients. The Sisters of Providence of Holyoke came to Murphy in 1956 to manage Petrie Hospital and renamed it Providence Hospital. The 22-bed Murphy General Hospital was built by Dr. F. V. Taylor in 1941 and closed in July 1969 due to insufficient staff and property. In 1956, a $375,000, 30-bed non-profit regional hospital named District Memorial was constructed in Andrews. In January 1974 the Murphy Town Council approved spending $4,000 on a study to see whether constructing a new hospital was feasible. Following this study, Providence Hospital closed in 1978 and Murphy Medical Center was founded in 1979. Citing uncollected payments, District Memorial Hospital declared bankruptcy in 2000, closed soon afterward, and was demolished. Murphy Medical Center was acquired by Erlanger Health System and renamed Erlanger Western Carolina Hospital in 2019. Today it is the only hospital in the state west of Bryson City and Franklin.

Cherokee County operated on Central time as late as 1934. It is now located in the Eastern Time Zone. In the late 1930s, Hiwassee Dam was built in northwest Cherokee County by the Tennessee Valley Authority, creating Hiwassee Lake. It is the highest overspill dam in the Eastern United States and was the tallest in the world when it was completed in 1940. A second TVA dam, Apalachia, was built near the Tennessee border in 1942. In the 1950s, the world&#x27;s largest and most powerful pump was added to Hiwassee Dam.

The Nantahala Regional Library, headquartered in Murphy, was organized in 1937. It is the oldest regional library in North Carolina and one of the first regional libraries formed in the United States. In the early 1940s, religious tourist attraction Fields of the Wood opened in western Cherokee County with the world&#x27;s largest Christian cross and biggest Ten Commandments, covering a mountainside. In June 1955, the county health department moved into a new building at its current location. Tri-County Community College was founded in Peachtree in late 1964. Cherokee County&#x27;s only animal shelter, Valley River Humane Society, was founded in Marble in 1969. A four-lane highway was built between Murphy and Andrews around 1977.

An F4 tornado in western Cherokee County killed four people (including two children) and injured 40 on April 3, 1974. It destroyed 45 homes near Murphy, causing $13 million (1974) in damages. The F4 was the deadliest of four tornadoes that struck the county during the first four days of April that year in the 1974 Super Outbreak. An EF-2 tornado hit Murphy the night of March 2, 2012, in the Tornado outbreak of March 2–3, 2012, damaging businesses and temporarily closing two schools. An EF-1 tornado hit the Peachtree community on the night of May 8, 2024, in the Tornado outbreak of May 6–9, 2024. The Cherokee County Historical Museum was founded in 1977 and occupies a former Carnegie Library building in downtown Murphy.

In 2014, the U.S. Forest Service made the decision to close Hanging Dog Campground in Nantahala National Forest. A proposal to open a 1,200-acre state park at the site was dismissed by the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources in 2023, as officials said the project would cost more than $20 million. Tourism has become a major industry for the county. As of 2023, the tourism industry employs at least 590 people in the county and generates more than $100 million in annual visitor spending.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.38%) is water.

Located in the southern Appalachian Mountains, Cherokee County contains a varied natural landscape. Portions of the county fall within the boundaries of the Nantahala National Forest. The Hiwassee River flows into Tennessee after passing through this county from southeast to northwest; it is a tributary of the Tennessee River. Both rivers are known to have had several historic Cherokee towns and villages located along their banks.

As of 2022, the county had 25,410 acres of agricultural land and 246 farms. Cherokee County has a total of 28 dams according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Thirteen are classified as high-hazard, meaning a dam failure may be deadly; nine of those have no emergency action plans. Of the 13 high-hazard dams, eight are marked as potentially dangerous; one is considered an immediate threat.

In April 1974, parts of Cherokee County were affected by a historic weather event, the 1974 Super Outbreak of tornadoes. This affected parts of 13 states and was the second-largest such event to be recorded in the U.S.

===Cherokee reserve===
Portions of the Qualla Boundary are located in Cherokee County. These are non-contiguous and are separate from the main part of the Qualla Boundary, which is in Swain and Jackson counties. The land is exclusive territory of the federally recognized Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and is protected by their Tribal Police. Following the success of Harrah&#x27;s Cherokee Tribal Casino in Cherokee, the EBCI opened a second tribal casino in 2015 on a plot of their land here, located within the Murphy city limits.

<doc id="93328" wikidata="Q504410" url="?curid=93328" title="Chatham County, North Carolina">
<text>Chatham County ( ) is a county located in the Piedmont area of the U.S. state of North Carolina. It is also the location of the geographic center of North Carolina, northwest of Sanford. As of the 2020 census, the population was 76,285. Its county seat is Pittsboro.

Chatham County is part of the Durham-Chapel Hill, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Raleigh-Durham-Cary, NC Combined Statistical Area, which had an estimated population of 2,368,947 in 2023.

==History==

Some of the first European settlers of what would become the county were English Quakers, who settled along the Haw and Eno rivers. The county was formed in 1771 from Orange County. It had been named in 1758 for William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, who served as British Prime Minister from 1766 to 1768 and opposed harsh colonial policies. In 1907, parts of Chatham County and Moore County were combined to form Lee County.

The county did not have a county seat until 1778 when Chatham Courthouse was built. It was not until 1787 that it was renamed Pittsboro In 1781, Chatham Courthouse was located the south side of Robeson Creek, where the Horton Middle school is currently located. The Chatham Courthouse was the site of an engagement during the American Revolution on July 17, 1781. On July 16, 1781, Patriot leaders had tried and sentenced to hang several Loyalist leaders. Hearing of their fate, Loyalist leader Colonel David Fanning and his men encircled Chatham Courthouse and took 53 prisoners including Colonel Ambrose Ramsey, some local militia, and three members of the North Carolina General Assembly.

While not devoted to large plantations, the county was developed for small farms, where slave labor was integral to the owners&#x27; productivity and success. By 1860 one-third of the county population were African Americans, chiefly enslaved.

Moncure, located at the confluence of the Deep and Haw rivers forming the Cape Fear River, once served as the westernmost inland port in the state. Steamships could travel between it and the Atlantic Coast along that major river.

After the Civil War and emancipation, white violence against freedmen increased in an assertion of white supremacy and enforced dominance after emancipation. From the late 1860s secret terrorist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan, Constitutional Union Guard, and White Brotherhood were active against blacks in the county. After Reconstruction and into the early 20th century, a total of six lynchings of African Americans were recorded here. Harriet Finch, Jerry Finch, Lee Tyson, John Pattishall on September 30, 1885. Harriet Finch is 1 of only 4 lynchings of women to occur in North Carolina. Henry Jones was lynched on January 12, 1899, after being accused of raping and murdering Nancy Welch/Welsh, a white widow in Chatham County. The sixth person to be lynched was Eugene Daniel who was hanged and then had his body riddled with bullets on September 18, 1921.

There was a notorious mass lynching of four African Americans on September 29, 1885, who were taken from the county jail in Pittsboro by a disguised mob at 1 am. The mob of 50–100 people hanged and killed Jerry Finch, his wife Harriet, and Lee Tyson, arrested for a robbery/murder. Harriet Finch was one of four black women to be lynched in the state. They also hanged John Pattishall, who was awaiting trial for two other unrelated robbery/murders. Afterward, the editor of &quot;The Chatham Record&quot; strongly condemned the lynchings. The county had the second-highest total of lynchings in the state, a number equaled by two other counties in this period.

In 1977, the county adopted a council-manager form of government and hired a county manager. On March 25, 2010, the Chatham County Courthouse, built in 1881 in the county seat of Pittsboro, caught fire while undergoing renovations. It has now been rebuilt.

===Coal mining===
Spanning the southern border of Chatham County, the Deep River Coal Field contains the only known potentially economic bituminous coal deposits in the state. Coal was mined here on an artisan scale in colonial times. It was commercially produced beginning from the early 1850s.

The communities of Carbonton and Cumnock (formerly called Egypt in Lee County) developed with the coal mining industry. Much of the coal mined in the field during the Civil War was used for Confederate operations.

The Coal Glen mine disaster of the 1920s, frequent flooding by the Deep River, the depth of the coal seam, and faulting of the seam sealed the fate of the mines. Production ceased in 1953.

===Agriculture and industry===
The county was long dependent on agriculture as the basis of the economy, and there were numerous subsistence farmers in historic times. The area&#x27;s natural soil conditions (composed mostly of the hard red clay soil common to the Piedmont) did not support the cultivation of commodity cash crops such as tobacco; this was never important in the county&#x27;s economy. As a result, settlers held fewer slaves than in some areas of the state, but by 1860 enslaved African Americans constituted about one-third of the county population. The production of livestock has always been more important to the county, especially the breeding of cattle and poultry.

The county once had a thriving dairy industry, but in recent years most farms have been sold and developed.

Chatham County has a deep tradition in southern music. Tommy Thompson, of the Red Clay Ramblers, and Tommy Edwards have entertained for decades with traditional, old time and bluegrass. Artists in many styles of music have emerged, from rock and roll to big band. Of late, Shakori Hills Grassroots Festival of Music and Dance hosts various styles of music. A four-day outdoor festival is held twice each year, in April and October. Shakori Hills is also the location of the Hoppin John Fiddlers Convention and Mountain Aid benefit concert.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.84%) is water.

The county lies totally within the Piedmont physiographic region. The topography of the county is generally gently rolling with several higher hills rising above the general terrain. One of these hills, Terrells Mountain, on the Orange County line is the transmitter site for several radio and TV stations for the Raleigh-Durham market, including WUNC-TV 4, WDCG (G105), WNCB (B93.9), and WUNC 91.5 FM (NC Public Radio).

The county lies within the Cape Fear River drainage basin. The Cape Fear River begins in the county near the community of Moncure, at the confluence of the Haw River and the Deep River below Jordan Lake. B. Everett Jordan Lake, a major reservoir and flood-control lake, is located within the New Hope River basin and lies mainly in eastern Chatham County. The lake is owned by the US Army Corps of Engineers and is partially leased by the state of North Carolina as Jordan Lake State Recreation Area.

Much of the eastern part of the county lies within the Triassic Basin, a subregion of the Piedmont. Much of the bedrock in the county is volcanic in origin and formed during the Triassic period (hence the name). The Triassic origins have led to the formation of coal deposits in the southern part of the county. The &quot;Boren Clay Products Pit&quot; just north of Gulf in extreme southern Chatham County is a place where Triassic flora fossils persist. The volcanic origins also led to the creation of high amounts of metamorphic-based rocks in the county. The county lies on the Carolina Slate Belt. Soils in the county are mostly clay based and have a deep red color, as do most soils in the Piedmont. Groundwater in the county is generally full of minerals and tends to be &quot;hard&quot; if not softened. Mineral-based water was the attraction at Mt. Vernon Springs during the latter part of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century. A resort spa was established at the mineral springs. Visitors would drink the water in the hopes of curing ailments and diseases. The resort closed in the early 20th century and is now gone. The springs are still there and are maintained by a local church.

The county has a humid subtropical climate and experiences hot and humid summers and cold winters.

==Government and politics==
===Government===

A five-member Board of Commissioners governs Chatham County. The commissioners are elected at large, but must reside within a particular district. Members of the Chatham County Board of Commissioners are elected for four-year terms, but the terms are staggered so that all five seats are not up for election at the same time. The board appoints a clerk, county manager, county attorney, and county tax administrator. The county manager oversees the regular operation of the county government&#x27;s administration.

Chatham County is a member of the Central Pines Regional Council.

Chatham County lies within the bounds of North Carolina&#x27;s 18th Prosecutorial District, the 18th Superior Court District, and the 18th District Court District.

=== Politics ===










At a presidential level, Chatham County leans Democratic: no Republican presidential nominee has carried Chatham County since Ronald Reagan’s 1984 landslide, although John Kerry came within six votes of losing the county in 2004, and no candidate from either major party has obtained less than thirty-five percent of the county&#x27;s vote since the three-way 1968 election when Richard Nixon managed to carry the county with merely 36.2% of the vote. Before 1960, Chatham was basically a typical &quot;Solid South&quot; county, only voting Republican in 1928 due to opposition to Al Smith’s Roman Catholic faith, and in 1900 – although in 1892 it was along with Nash and Sampson counties one of three counties in the state to give a plurality of its ballots to Populist James B. Weaver.

In 2022 local and state elections Chatham County favored Democratic candidates. The county is represented in the North Carolina Senate by Democrat Natalie Murdock in the 20th district and in the North Carolina House of Representatives by Democrat Robert Reives in the 54th district.

== Economy ==
The county is one of the state leaders in the poultry industry. Forage crops such as hay are also grown in large quantities in the county. Carolina Farm Stewardship Association has been housed in Chatham County, along with many organic agriculture farmers, including Councilman Farms and Phillips Dairy Farms.

Industrial growth in the county has been focused around the Siler City and Moncure areas of the county, with Moncure dominating. Companies in that area include, Progress Energy, Boise Cascade, Honeywell, and Arauco. Brick manufacturing, which makes use of the local red clay soil, has been an important economic factor in the Moncure area, with several brick plants operating there and in Brickhaven.

3M operates a greenstone mine south of Pittsboro along US 15-501. Greenstone is processed to manufacture roofing-shingle granules. In 2007, residents opposed to industrialization successfully blocked a similar quarry from being developed in the western part of the county.

Manufacturing investments by the private sector, local government and federal incentives have led to new jobs in the computer chip sector and electric vehicles. By the end of 2024, the new Wolfspeed factory will begin production of silicon carbide wafers for computer chips, which will create up to 1,800 new jobs.

==Education==
Chatham County contributes funds to, but does not govern, K-12 public education and the community college system. The Chatham County School System is governed by its own elected board. There are four public high schools: Seaforth in Pittsboro,Northwood in Pittsboro, Jordan-Matthews in Siler City, and Chatham Central in Bear Creek.

Chatham is home to three charter schools – Woods Charter School, Chatham Charter High School, and Willow Oak Montessori Charter School.

Woods Charter School is a grade K-12 public school. The school moved into a new fully equipped building on 160 Woodland Grove Lane outside Pittsboro in August 2008. Woods ranked &quot;top ten&quot; on SAT scores in North Carolina.

Chatham Charter High School is a grade K-12 public school. The school is located on 2200 Hamp Stone Road in Siler City, NC.

Willow Oak Montessori Charter School is a tuition-free public school located in Central Chatham County, that currently serves children in grades 1 through 8.

Central Carolina Community College, which has two campuses in the county, is governed by its own appointed Board of Trustees.

Generally, county resources provide only part of the total funding for K-12 and community colleges, but the county devotes a considerable amount of its resources to public education. In fiscal year 2007–08, more than 39% of the county&#x27;s tax dollars went to education.

According to the N.C. Association of County Commissioners Annual Tax and Budget Survey for fiscal year 2006–07, the county ranked 11th in the state in total spending per student and fifth in the percent of the current expense/general funds spent on schools per student. The county also was 14th in overall education resources per capita during fiscal year 06–07.

==Transportation==
Chatham County has managed to retain its rural character in part because it is not served by an Interstate Highway. However, Chatham County plays an important role in regional transportation due to its close proximity to the geographic center of North Carolina and to major cities such as Raleigh, Durham and Greensboro. Though driving is the dominant mode due to the county&#x27;s rural nature, residents enjoy a number of transportation options.

===Major highways===

U.S. Routes 421 and 15–501 run in a north–south direction through the county; U.S. 421 serves Siler City and U.S. 15–501 serves Pittsboro. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the NCDOT invested more than one hundred million dollars upgrading U.S. 64, U.S. 421 and U.S. 15–501, which had previously been two-lane roads, to multi-lane highways. There is now a U.S. 64 bypass north of Pittsboro; a similar freeway diverts traffic on U.S. 421 east of Siler City.

===Transit===
Chatham County is served by two public transit providers – Chatham Transit Network and Chapel Hill Transit. Chatham Transit Network (CTN) is the Community Transportation Program for Chatham County, providing fixed route and human service transportation.

<text>Catawba County ( ) is a county in the U.S. state of North Carolina. As of the 2020 census, the population was 160,610. Its county seat is Newton, and its largest community is Hickory.

The county is part of the Hickory-Lenoir-Morganton, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Catawba County, formed in 1842 from Lincoln County, was named after the Catawba River. The word &quot;catawba&quot; is rooted in the Choctaw sound &quot;kat&#x27;a pa&quot;, loosely translated as &quot;to divide or separate, to break.&quot; However, scholars are fairly certain that this word was imposed from outside. 
The Native Americans who once inhabited the region known as the Catawba people, were considered one of the most powerful Southeastern Siouan-speaking tribes in the Carolina Piedmont. They now live along the border of North Carolina, near the city of Rock Hill, South Carolina. Scots-Irish and German colonial immigrants first settled in the Catawba River valley in the mid-18th century. An official history of the Scots-Irish and German settlement was documented in 1954, by Charles J. Preslar Jr, and more recently by a series of three books by Gary Freeze, called The Catawbans.

<text>Caswell County is a county in the U.S. state of North Carolina. It is located in the Piedmont Triad region of the state. At the 2020 census, the population was 22,736. Its county seat is Yanceyville.

Partially bordering the state of Virginia, the county was formed from Orange County in 1777 and named for Richard Caswell, the first governor of North Carolina. Other Caswell County communities include Blanch, Casville, Leasburg, Milton, Pelham, Prospect Hill, Providence, and Semora.

The Dan River flows through a portion of the county. Hyco Lake is a popular recreational area and key water source.

==History==
===Early history===
The area was first inhabited by Native Americans over 10,000 years ago. Indigenous residents were of Siouan groups, including the Occaneechi. Abundant evidence of indigenous activity has been found in many parts of Caswell County.

In 1663 and 1665, Charles I of England gave all of what is now North Carolina and South Carolina (named for him) to eight of his noblemen, the Lords Proprietors. Caswell County was originally part of the land grant belonging to Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon.

Colonial records show land grants in northern Orange County (later Caswell County) as early as 1748. There were Scotch-Irish, German, and English settlements along the Dan River and Hogans and Country Line creeks by 1751. The first recorded settlement occurred between 1750 and 1755 when eight to ten families migrated from Orange County and Culpeper, Virginia. The primary reason for resettlement was economic. They were searching for fertile land, which the low land of the Dan River and several creeks provided.

After the initial settlements, the area experienced rapid population growth. The free settlers who lived in the county before 1800 were mostly of English, Scotch-Irish, French Huguenot, and German descent. Scotch-Irish and German families traversed the Great Wagon Road, which was the main route for settlement in the region, and had come by way of Virginia and Pennsylvania. English and Huguenot migrants came from settled areas of eastern North Carolina, following the Great Trading Path. English colonists also came from Virginia using the same network of roads and trails.

Enslaved Africans were brought to the area by slaveholders and slave-trading agents involved in speculation. By 1800, enslaved persons accounted for nearly one-third (32%) of Caswell County&#x27;s population. As they grew in number, substantially so after 1790, they powered more and more of the area&#x27;s agricultural and economic development.

The settlers first consisted mainly of yeoman farmers and planters. Middle-class settlers arrived afterward in the 18th century and were called the &quot;new families.&quot; Scotch-Irish and English culture predominated in the area socially, spiritually, educationally, and economically.

Yeoman farmers accounted for more than half the settler population. Few if any were enslavers at this time. The yeomanry owned small family farms and lived in log homes. They farmed for subsistence, with surpluses going toward debt settlement or bartering for goods. Relying on the skilled and unskilled labor of family members, neighbors, and others, they linked farms to early grist mills and sawmills.

Middle-class families accounted for less than a fifth of the settler population and were chiefly involved in business entrepreneurship, craftsmanship, small-scale commercial farming, export, and trade. They actively promoted business and settlement in and around towns such as Leasburg, Milton, and numerous villages to further local economic development and their own upward social mobility. As the area grew more populated and prosperous, a significant number of middle-class residents transitioned to the upper-middle class.

The planter class constituted the upper class and were the smallest segment of the settler population. Most came from prosperous families and were well versed in the literature of the Enlightenment. Due to their social position, they deeply impacted the county economically, culturally, and politically. The area&#x27;s other planters, in contrast, were less prominent and wealthy than the gentry in their midst. They were common or smaller planters with less land and lived more ordinary upper-middle class lives. Several had indentured servants or bound apprentices of mixed race.

No matter their class distinction, planters were the most socioeconomically advantaged inhabitants. They traded commodities with other settlers and were involved in land speculation and the domestic slave trade. They founded mills, sold livestock, and grew profitable crops such as wheat, corn, and oats on farms or plantations. Until the early 1800s, tobacco was harvested mainly as a secondary crop by the settlers depending on changing market demand, pricing, soil exhaustion, and other variables.

From the early 1760s until the early 1770s, it was common for local planters to receive credit loans from British-owned mercantile companies in the province for the purpose of funding the expansion of agricultural production. The monies went toward purchases of additional land and enslaved labor. Such companies also supplied enslaved workers and consumer items to area planters and managed tobacco exports sent to Virginia warehouses. Their merchants offered good tobacco prices initially but eventually reduced them greatly, causing many planters to fall into substantial debt, which could not be repaid without selling land or enslaved people. Due to the American Revolutionary War, most of these debts were never repaid. After the war, the demand for tobacco rose when new markets were found without such middlemen.

Not long after they arrived, the settlers to the area had been progressive in building homes, starting businesses, and establishing churches. Prominent planters promoted a culture of education that later saw the creation of private academies in the early 1800s. The older families were generally more politically and fiscally conservative than the newcomers. They usually voted against funds for postwar internal improvements and were not supportive of expenditures that raised the county debt due to an aversion to raising taxes and expanding the role of government.

Before the Revolutionary War, the biggest threats to public safety and social stability in the region were the French and Indian War and the Regulator Movement in present Orange County. While the movement increased class tensions within communities, the settlers came together in support of the American Revolution.

Prior to the Revolution, the Church of England was the most common religious affiliation in the area. Pennsylvania missionary Hugh McAden founded Red House Presbyterian Church possibly as early as 1755. Country Line Primitive Baptist Church was established in 1772. Lea&#x27;s Chapel, a Methodist Episcopal church, was organized in 1779.

=== Creation ===
Caswell County was formed from a portion of Orange County, effective June 1, 1777. It was created so that governance could be more localized and efficient. The county was named for Richard Caswell who was the first governor of North Carolina after the Declaration of Independence in 1776, a delegate at the First and Second Continental Congresses, and a senior officer of militia in the Southern theater of the Revolutionary War. The legislative act creating Caswell ordered its first court to be held at the homestead of Thomas Douglas and appointed commissioners to find a permanent location to build a county courthouse and prison.

During the prelude to the Battle of Guilford Courthouse in 1781, Lord Cornwallis pursued General Nathanael Greene through Caswell County. Greene&#x27;s retreat, called the &quot;Race to the Dan,&quot; was a calculated ploy. His objective was to extend Cornwallis far beyond his supply base in Camden, South Carolina, so that his fighting power would be significantly diminished. Cornwallis and his troops marched through Camp Springs and Leasburg, which was the first county seat. They continued on to the Red House Church area of Semora. It is unknown how many locally enslaved people fled to the British for safe haven before the Battle of Yorktown in 1781.

By the war&#x27;s end in 1783, Caswell County had made significant contributions in personnel and materiel to the war effort. Little fighting took place locally. County residents renowned for their Revolutionary War service include Lieutenant Colonel Henry &quot;Hal&quot; Dixon, John Herndon Graves, Dr. Lancelot Johnston, and Starling Gunn. By that point no county courthouse had been built, so the General Assembly passed another act authorizing the county to erect public buildings. A courthouse was subsequently established at Leasburg, which was officially incorporated in 1788.

After the war, a small number of free Black families moved to the area. Most of the men had served in the Continental Army or Navy. Usually skilled in a trade, they farmed in a manner similar to yeoman farmers but did not have equal rights.

In 1786, a special state census ranked Caswell County as the second-largest county with a population of 9,839. Halifax County ranked first with 489 more inhabitants.

In February 1792, the eastern half of the county legally became Person County. After the division, the seat of Caswell County&#x27;s government was moved to a more central location. The community hosting the new county seat was originally called Caswell Court House. In 1833, the name was changed to Yanceyville.

===Industrialization and growth===
====Early 19th century to World War II====
In the early 1800s, Caswell County&#x27;s wealthy landowners were moving away from diversified farming and accelerating toward tobacco as a single cash crop. This agricultural conversion considerably affected the growth of the enslaved population, which rose 54 percent from 1800 to 1810.

In 1810, the village of Caswell Court House (later Yanceyville) had one store and a hattery, two taverns, and approximately fifteen homes. Silversmiths, blacksmiths, wheelwrights, coachmakers, and other tradesmen soon began opening businesses. Attorneys, doctors, preachers, and a number of politicians were also drawn to the growing village and county seat.

Around 1830, the &quot;Boom Era&quot; began, which lasted until the American Civil War. During this period, the county saw the creation of new flour and lumber mills and experienced the furniture output of Thomas Day, a free Black businessman in Milton. A cotton factory, foundry, and silk company were also in operation. In Yanceyville, roads were improved and given names by 1841. The town became wealthy enough by 1852 to charter an independent bank, the Bank of Yanceyville, whose market capitalization ranked among the highest in the state.

In 1839, on Abisha Slade&#x27;s farm in Purley, an enslaved man named Stephen discovered the bright leaf tobacco flue-curing process. 
Slade perfected the curing method in 1856. The following year his farm harvested of bright leaf tobacco on 100 acres of land and the crop was sold in Lynchburg, Virginia, at an exorbitant price. Slade taught the flue-curing technique to many farmers in the area and elsewhere. Bright leaf tobacco became popular with smokers and North Carolina growers gained a dominant position in the tobacco industry as a result.

The tobacco economy, and the industries supported by it, enriched many locals. The lifestyle of many yeoman farmers changed into that of planters. The newly wealthy built impressive homes and sent their children to private academies. However, the majority of Caswell County&#x27;s inhabitants did not benefit. In 1850, enslaved African Americans accounted for 52 percent of the county&#x27;s population.

By 1856, tobacco overshadowed all other forms of enterprise in Caswell County. Tobacco warehouses and manufacturing &amp; processing plants dotted the skyline, with the largest centers located in Yanceyville and Milton. The growth of the industry and increase in raw tobacco production created an expanding need for labor. The number of enslaved people grew to 9,355 in 1860, from a total of 4,299 in 1810 and 2,788 in 1800. 
There were 26 free Black inhabitants residing in Caswell County in 1800, 90 in 1810, and 282 in 1860. The white population declined from a peak of 8,399 in 1850 to 6,578 in 1860. This was due to the western migration of small-scale farmers who were unable to compete with the larger tobacco planters.

In 1858, at the tail end of the opulent Boom Era, construction began on Caswell County Courthouse. Built using enslaved labor, it was completed in 1861 during the onset of the Civil War.

After the war, the county continued its economic dependence on tobacco and was averse to agricultural diversification. The Second Industrial Revolution in varying degrees passed it by. Other than a few tobacco mills, there was an absence of industry and no railroad. The population significantly diminished until 1910 when it began to increase. By then, Yanceyville and Semora had phone service.

The county&#x27;s population kept growing through the 1920s. To provide better public facilities, the Caswell County Board of Education initiated school improvement projects. During this time in 1926, &quot;The Caswell Messenger&quot; began publication.

In 1937, the Yanceyville Rotary Club was founded and members successfully pioneered economic and community development projects. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal programs during the Depression years, improved farming techniques starting in the 1940s, and the economic impact of World War II also contributed significantly to revitalizing the area.

====Post–World War II to early 21st century====
After World War II, as Caswell County and the broader United States returned to civilian life, it became evident that new efforts were needed to overcome old economic barriers. County leaders in the 1950s and 1960s understood that economic advancement depended on the development of water resources sufficient for industrial expansion, better infrastructure such as roads, providing new and various county-wide services, increasing cultural resources, and operating local government in a business-like fashion. The history of Caswell County in the second half of the 20th century is characterized by much progress in these areas, but critical needs remained. What is more, the heritage of the county&#x27;s earlier Boom Era of bright leaf tobacco and Greek Revival architecture represented both an opportunity and a hindrance.

By 1950, Caswell County reached a peak of 20,870 inhabitants, which was not surpassed until the 2000 census. The economic upswing of the 1950s saw new businesses entering the area. This included the opening of a meatpacking operation in 1956 in the county&#x27;s southwest corner. Between the mid-1950s and mid-1980s, the county also attracted textile mills to Yanceyville. Such growth enabled the local government to broaden its tax base and see increases in public revenue.

As the county entered the 21st century, it faced the aftermath of a crisis in the tobacco industry, the urgent need for economic development in light of the Information Age, and a national trend toward heritage tourism as a means of economic growth. Caswell County&#x27;s economy continued to develop, diversify, and experience growth away from tobacco production. Business and entrepreneurial activity increased due to the area&#x27;s location, commercial properties, land primed for development, relatively low property tax rate, and other factors.

===Civil War period===
In May 1861, North Carolina with some reluctance joined the Confederacy, which by then was at war with the Union. Caswell County provided troops, clothing, food, and tobacco in support of the war effort. Companies A, C, and D of the North Carolina Thirteenth Regiment consisted almost entirely of county enlistments. The area&#x27;s soldiers fought in every major Civil War battle and there were many casualties.

In Caswell County in January 1862, a significant number of African Americans fled slavery. Seven patrol squads comprising 34 individuals were dispatched to Yanceyville in search of them. It is unknown if any were able to find safe haven behind Union lines.

In the spring of 1862, salt used for meat preservation was rationed, which was a statewide measure. As the war raged on, the county&#x27;s inhabitants faced food shortages. Daily necessities were in short supply. Speculators benefitted while most remained in need.

The minutes of the Caswell County Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions from January 1863 to July 1866 were either lost or destroyed. Consequently, it is difficult for researchers to ascertain what was occurring in the county&#x27;s court system during this period.

At the 1860 U.S. census, 58.7 percent of Caswell County&#x27;s population was enslaved. Due to the Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863, enslaved African Americans in Confederate territory were recognized as free individuals by the executive branch of the U.S. federal government. They gained military protection upon crossing into Union-controlled areas or through the advance of federal troops.

Many African Americans likely either fled or attempted to flee the area between 1863 and the war&#x27;s end. Most remained confined behind Confederate lines until Union forces occupied much of the state during the Carolinas campaign in 1865.

===Reconstruction era===
After the Civil War during Reconstruction, the pattern of daily life in Caswell County dramatically changed. The previous plantation way of life had disappeared. Small farmers fell into deeper poverty. Abandoned land and eroded soil permeated the landscape. The area faced a decreased standard of living and insufficient public revenue for services that governments ordinarily provided.

Many whites in the county resented the war&#x27;s outcome as did others in the North Carolina Piedmont area. Regional newspapers actively fomented their bitterness. When Congressional Reconstruction was established in 1867, a large segment of residents characterized it as an effort by Radical Republicans to force Black suffrage upon them. A significant number began flocking to the Conservative Party, which was a coalition of the prewar Democratic Party and old-line Whigs.

African Americans in the area had experienced immense jubilation when informed of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. Their freedom was then safeguarded by Union troops, the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, and the protection of the Thirteenth Amendment. However, in 1866 restrictive state laws called &quot;Black Codes&quot; were passed in North Carolina by former Confederate legislators who had returned to power as Conservatives. Enacted to regain control over African Americans, these laws were nullified by congressional civil rights legislation later in 1866.

In 1868 and 1869, the Republican-controlled General Assembly ratified the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments respectively. Ensuring the right to vote regardless of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, the Fifteenth Amendment became a part of the U.S. Constitution in February 1870. In that year&#x27;s U.S. census, African Americans represented approximately 59 percent of Caswell County&#x27;s population. Over a span of five years from 1865 to 1870, they had gained constitutional protection from slavery and voting rights. They could seek employment, use public accommodations, acquire land, and participate in the political process.

In January 1868, thirteen African American delegates representing 19 majority-Black counties attended the state&#x27;s constitutional convention in Raleigh. They were North Carolina&#x27;s first Black Caucus. Their members included a Republican legislator from Caswell County named Wilson Carey. At the convention, he spoke out against Conservative proposals to attract white immigrants to North Carolina. Carey felt the focus should instead be on African American North Carolinians who had built up the state.

The 1868 constitutional convention passed resolutions that included the abolition of slavery, the adoption of universal male suffrage, the removal of property and religious qualifications for voting and office holding, and the establishment of a uniform public school system. Because the convention gave North Carolina a new constitution in 1868 that protected the rights of African Americans, the state was readmitted to the Union that same year on July 4 upon ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Enfranchising African Americans with the right to vote in elections was anathema to county and statewide Conservative Party members. This was not only due to their white supremacy but also because it threatened their power. Their animosity toward white and Black Republicans had begun to skyrocket when Republican gubernatorial candidate William W. Holden endorsed universal male suffrage at the party&#x27;s state convention in March 1867. The suffrage resolution&#x27;s passage and Holden&#x27;s victory in 1868 substantially added to the continuing friction. This growing tension helped make Caswell County and the region a hotbed of Ku Klux Klan activity that same year. African Americans and their supporters in the area were subsequently subjected to a heinous campaign of violence, intimidation, and murder to prevent them from voting.

As Klan violence in Caswell County escalated in 1870, the Republican state senator of the area, John W. Stephens, became increasingly fearful of attack. On May 21, he went to the courthouse in Yanceyville to convince the former Democratic county sheriff, Frank A. Wiley, to seek re-election as a Republican with his support and thus achieve a political reconciliation in the county. Wiley had secretly agreed to work with the Klan and lured Stephens into a trap, whereby he was choked with a rope and stabbed to death by Klansmen in a vacant courthouse room. The current sheriff, Jessie C. Griffith, himself a Klansman and prominent Conservative, made little effort to investigate the assassination.

Holden was disgusted by the murder of Stephens. Conferring with his advisers, he decided to raise a militia to combat the Klan in Caswell and nearby Alamance County. On July 8, he declared Caswell County to be in a state of insurrection. About 350 militiamen, led by Colonel George Washington Kirk, arrived on July 18 and established headquarters in Yanceyville. The militia arrested 19 men in the county as well as several dozen more in Alamance County, and Klan activities in both counties promptly ceased. The prisoners were initially denied &quot;habeas corpus&quot; before being turned over to local courts, which did not convict any of the accused. On November 10, Holden declared that there was no longer a state of insurrection in Alamance and Caswell counties.

In December 1870, the state legislature, which had a Conservative majority that had come into power on the heels of the political backlash they had spearheaded against Holden over the incident, impeached him on eight charges. He was convicted on six of them and removed from office in March 1871. Holden&#x27;s departure severely weakened the Republican Party in the state.

The Conservative Party proceeded to institute white supremacy in state government in 1876. They dropped the name &quot;Conservative&quot; that same year to become the Democratic Party of North Carolina. When federal troops left the next year, ending Reconstruction, the stage was set for the passage of Jim Crow laws.

===Civil rights movement===
In the 20th century, during the era of school segregation in the United States, many African American students in Caswell County attended Caswell County Training School, which was renamed Caswell County High School in the 1960s. Vanessa Siddle Walker&#x27;s 1996 book, &quot;Their Highest Potential: An African American School Community in the Segregated South&quot;, provides detailed insights into this school, now a designated site on the National Register of Historic Places in Caswell County.

By the end of the 1960s, Caswell County&#x27;s public schools were beginning to fully integrate. A decade and a half earlier in 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. In a later decision by the Court in May 1955 known as &quot;Brown II&quot;, school districts were given the ambiguous order to desegregate &quot;with all deliberate speed.&quot; Like many school boards in the South at the time, the Caswell County Board of Education interpreted the Court&#x27;s ambiguity in a manner that served to delay, obstruct, and slow the process of racially integrating its schools.

The Board of Education&#x27;s resistance to integration had already been emboldened by North Carolina&#x27;s passage of the Pupil Assignment Act in April 1955. The legislation gave county school boards full school placement authority. Driven by the act&#x27;s power, the Pearshall Plan&#x27;s passage, and the prevailing anti-integration sentiment of the white community, the school district kept assigning children to schools in a segregated manner.

In response to these developments, fifteen local African American parents presented a petition to the school district in August 1956 calling for the abolition of segregation, which the board refused to consider. Undeterred, the parents organized protests that included the NAACP. A federal lawsuit was subsequently filed in December 1956 asking for the immediate desegregation of Caswell County and North Carolina schools.

In August 1957, 43 local students, many of whom were plaintiffs via their parents in the federal court case, applied for admission to public schools that were closer to their homes than the segregated ones they had been assigned. The school board denied their applications and continued to reject them through 1962. Nevertheless, the federal lawsuit kept moving forward.

In December 1961, U.S. District Court Judge Edwin M. Stanley ruled that two brothers, Charlie and Fred Saunders, could promptly attend Archibald Murphey Elementary School, a now-closed formerly all-white school near Milton. When the new semester began in January, however, they did not present themselves for enrollment. The Ku Klux Klan had sent a threatening letter to the Saunders family previously. According to an affidavit submitted by the children&#x27;s father C.H. Saunders Sr., the KKK&#x27;s threats caused him to miss a school board reassignment hearing ordered by the judge in August 1961 prior to his final judgment. Saunders also conveyed that he would be agreeable to transferring schools if his children&#x27;s protection at Murphey Elementary could be assured.
A year after the Saunders decision, Stanley ruled that the school district had been improperly administering the Pupil Assignment Act. In December 1962, he told the school boards of Caswell County and the city of Durham to allow every schoolchild complete freedom of choice regarding school placement. On January 22, 1963, sixteen African American schoolchildren enrolled in four of the county&#x27;s previously all-white schools.

On their first day of school, a group of white men harassed and threatened one of the parents, Jasper Brown, who was a local civil rights leader and farmer. He was pursued and menaced by the men as he drove home. After a rear-end collision, the other vehicle&#x27;s driver emerged with a firearm. Fearing for his life, Brown shot and wounded two of the men in an exchange of fire before turning himself in to police. Due to the circumstances, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy was soon informed of the incident.

Several months later, Brown was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon and served 90 days in jail. While awaiting trial, white men bombed his yard. His four children and the 12 others who integrated the county&#x27;s schools were physically threatened and emotionally abused throughout the semester. Despite requests from the NAACP and concerned families, no police protection was provided. Furthermore, the Board of Education refused to arrange school bus transportation.

By late 1967, only 57 African American children out of a Black student population of approximately 3,000 were attending integrated public schools in Caswell County. While there had been some faculty integration, the less than two percent enrollment rate in essence preserved segregation. The school district&#x27;s integration plan had not fostered sufficient desegregation. Its &quot;freedom of choice&quot; plan put the onus of integration on individual African American students and parents, who had to opt to cross the color line themselves. If they did so, they faced social stigma, severe discrimination, and other hardships. Consequently, many families, though supportive of integration efforts, chose to keep their children safe in valued Black schools such as Caswell County High School.

The school district&#x27;s low integration rate resulted in the U.S. Office of Education citing the county in 1966 as one of seven in the state that were not in compliance with its civil rights Title IV guidelines. The bureau began taking steps to cut off federal funding. The school district was not in full compliance with federal integration standards until 1969. In that year, the Caswell County Board of Education implemented a plan for complete desegregation after Judge Stanley ordered the school district in August 1968 to integrate starting in the 1969–1970 school year.

When school integration and consolidation subsequently occurred, Bartlett Yancey High School in Yanceyville became the only public high school in the county after Caswell County High School&#x27;s closure in 1969. The closed high school building&#x27;s educational use was promptly reconfigured. The new integrated school was named N.L. Dillard Junior High School in honor of the former high school&#x27;s principal. Integrated elementary schools were established based on zoning.

===Political leaders===
Caswell County has produced notable political leaders throughout its history. Such politicians include Donna Edwards, Archibald Debow Murphey, Romulus Mitchell Saunders, and Bartlett Yancey, Jr.

Legislators from the county had considerable influence on state politics during the first half of the 19th century. Bartlett Yancey was speaker of the North Carolina Senate from 1817 to 1827. Romulus Mitchell Saunders was concurrently speaker of the North Carolina House of Commons from 1819 to 1820.

Archibald D. Murphey has been called the &quot;Father of Education&quot; in North Carolina. Serving as a state senator, he proposed a publicly financed system of education in 1817. Murphey also made proposals regarding internal improvements and constitutional reform.

Donna Edwards is a former U.S. congresswoman. Before entering Congress, she was the executive director of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, which provides advocacy and legal support to battered women. She worked to pass the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. In 2015, Edwards and other members of Congress introduced the Restoring Education and Learning Act (REAL Act) to reinstate Pell Grants to prisoners.

===Depiction in the arts===
Writers including Alex Haley and artists such as Maud Gatewood have commented on Caswell County&#x27;s history in their work. The county was briefly referenced in Haley&#x27;s 1977 television miniseries Roots. It was cited as the location of champion cock fighter Tom Moore&#x27;s (Chuck Connors) plantation. When Gatewood designed the county seal in 1974, she added two large tobacco leaves as a symbol of the crop&#x27;s long prominence in the area.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.78%) is water. It is bordered by Person, Orange, Alamance, and Rockingham counties, and the state of Virginia. The Dan River flows through a part of the county. Hyco Lake is an important water source and popular recreational site.

==Economy==
The economy of Caswell County is rooted in agriculture, which continues to develop and experience growth away from tobacco cultivation. The area&#x27;s location, commercial properties, land primed for development, and relatively low property tax rate have contributed to an increase in business activity and entrepreneurship.

Caswell County&#x27;s agricultural sector produces hemp, tobacco, soybeans, corn, wheat, oats, barley, hay, alfalfa, beef cattle, sheep, swine, and poultry. The county also produces minerals such as soapstone, graphite, mica, corundum, microcline, and beryl.

NC Cooperative Extension in Yanceyville connects local agribusinesses and farmers with crucial research-based information and technology. The Caswell County Local Foods Council manages the Caswell Farmers&#x27; Market in Yanceyville and initiates community-driven projects.

The county is home to two industrial parks: Pelham Industrial Park in Pelham and Caswell County Industrial Park in Yanceyville. CoSquare, a coworking space that offers several business possibilities for entrepreneurs, is located in Yanceyville&#x27;s downtown historic district. The largest industries in Yanceyville are accommodation and food services, health care and social assistance, and manufacturing. Manufactured goods include textiles, clothing, and electronics.

Caswell County benefits from its proximity to the greater Piedmont Triad area, Danville, Virginia, and the Research Triangle. Residents have access to a host of goods, services, attractions, and employment in the region. The county receives economic activity in kind from these neighboring areas.

<text>Carteret County ( or ) is a county located in the U.S. state of North Carolina. As of the 2020 census, the population was 67,686. Its county seat is Beaufort. The county was created in 1722 as Carteret Precinct and gained county status in 1739. It was named for Sir George Carteret, one of the 17th century English Lords Proprietor, or for his descendant and heir John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville.

Carteret County comprises the Morehead City, NC Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the New Bern-Morehead City, NC Combined Statistical Area. Most of the county is part of the Crystal Coast.

==History==
The first male of English parents born in the current area of North Carolina was John Fulford. He was born in 1629 in what is now Carteret County. He settled in this area and died in 1729. An article dated September 18, 1893, in &quot;The New Bern Daily Journal&quot;, identified Fulford&#x27;s grave in a cemetery outside the county seat of Beaufort, in an area called the Straits. It was described as &quot;bricked up with English brick.&quot; In 1971 a survey by the Carteret County Historical Society found such a grave in the Fulford Cemetery off Piper Lane in Gloucester. The unmarked, bricked-up grave matching this description survives today.

One of the more prominent families from Carteret County was the Dennis family. William Dennis Sr. (b.1720 - d.1800) was an extremely colorful landowner, Revolutionary War officer, and defender of the county. In 1747, he assisted with the successful defense of the county during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear (fighting against Spanish pirates). During the Revolutionary War he served as a 2nd Major in the Carteret County Regiment of the North Carolina militia. In 1782, he fought alongside Lieutenant Colonel John Easton to drive the British from Carteret County. Dennis once owned the Hammock House, which became well known as the house owned by the pirate Blackbeard. His son, William Dennis Junior was a captain in the 8th North Carolina Regiment (1777-1778), was present at Valley Forge and also fought in the Carteret County Regiment (1781-1782). In the 1790 U.S. census, Dennis was one of the largest land owners in the county. Branches of the Dennis family include the Bells, Watsons and Pelletiers, many of whom continued to live in the area for many years. In a typical pattern of following the availability of new lands in the Deep South, some branches of this family later migrated to Mississippi and Texas in the 19th century.

In 2024, real estate developers in Cedar Point disturbed the site of an ancient Native American settlement. The discovery led to controversy over the continuance of the housing development and calls for new regulations to protect historical sites. Several state lawmakers pushed for construction to resume, with one legislator receiving campaign contributions from the project&#x27;s developers in 2022.

Carteret County operates under a council–manager form of government. The interim county manager is Sharon Griffin.

A voting machine malfunction in the county resulted in the loss of 4,438 ballots cast during early voting for the November 2, 2004, general election. Since the number of lost ballots exceeded the lead held (by Steve Troxler over Britt Cobb) in the statewide race for agriculture commissioner, the State Board of Elections decided to hold a special election on January 11, 2005, open only to the 18,500 voters in the county who either failed to vote or whose votes were lost. Both candidates filed legal challenges contesting the format of the new election. On February 4, 2005, Cobb conceded the race.

<text>Dornier Flugzeugwerke was a German aircraft manufacturer founded in Friedrichshafen in 1914 by Claude Dornier. Over the course of its long lifespan, the company produced many designs for both the civil and military markets.

==History==

Originally Dornier Metallbau, Dornier Flugzeugwerke took over Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen production facilities (Weingarten, Warnemünde, and the former Zeppelin shed at Manzell) when it failed in 1923.

Dornier was well known between the two world wars as a manufacturer of large, all-metal flying boats and of land based airliners. The record-breaking 1924 Wal () was used on many long distance flights and the Do X set records for its immense size and weight. Dornier&#x27;s successful landplane airliners, including the Komet (&quot;Comet&quot;) and Merkur (&quot;Mercury&quot;), were used by Lufthansa and other European carriers during the 1920s and early 30s. Dornier built its aircraft outside Germany during much of this period due to the restrictions placed on German aircraft manufacturers by the Treaty of Versailles: locations included Altenrhein, Switzerland, 12 km from Zeppelin&#x27;s Lindau (Bodensee) location. Foreign factories licence-building Dornier products included CMASA and Piaggio in Italy, CASA in Spain, Kawasaki in Japan, and Aviolanda in the Netherlands. Once the Nazi government came to power and abandoned the treaty&#x27;s restrictions, Dornier resumed production in Germany.

The success of the Wal family encouraged the development of derivatives, and of more advanced successors, such as the Do 18, and Do 24 which saw service in several armed forces, including German, into World War II.

Dornier&#x27;s most important World War II military aircraft design was the Do 17, nicknamed &quot;The Flying Pencil&quot;. It first flew in 1934 as a mailplane for Lufthansa but due to its narrow fuselage (hence its nickname) it was not commercially viable and was passed over. Dornier then developed it further as a military aircraft, with a prototype bomber flying in 1935, and in 1937 it was used in by the German Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War. Production continued in Germany and it was developed to fill multiple roles for the Luftwaffe. As a medium bomber it saw service during the early part of World War II, particularly during the Battle of Britain. It was later developed into a nightfighter to counter the RAF bomber offensive. Dornier developed the similar looking Do 217 from the Do 17 but it was a larger and completely new design. Dornier also developed the fastest piston-engined fighter of the war, the twin-engined Do 335, which was too late to see service.

After WWII, aircraft production was again forbidden in Germany, and Dornier relocated to Spain and then to Switzerland where the firm provided aeronautical consultancy services until returning to Germany in 1954. Post-war, Dornier re-established itself with successful STOL Do 27 and Do 28 utility planes. In 1974 it joined a joint venture with French aircraft manufacturers Dassault-Breguet to develop the Alpha Jet.

In 1983, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) acquired a production licence for the Dornier 228 and manufactured the aircraft for the Asian market. By 2013 a total of 117 Dornier 228 aircraft had been produced by HAL with plans to build 20 more during 2013-14. Pushpindar Singh Chopra was the agent of Dornier to India during this contract.

In 1985, Dornier became a member of the Daimler-Benz group, integrating its aeronautic assets with the parent company. As part of this transaction, Lindauer Dornier GmbH was spun off, creating a separate, family-owned firm, concentrating on textile machinery design and manufacturing. The rest of the company was split into several subsidiaries for defence, satellites, medtech and aircraft.

In 1996, the majority of Dornier Aircraft was acquired by Fairchild Aircraft, forming Fairchild Dornier. This company became insolvent in early 2002. Production of its 328 Jet was acquired by US company Avcraft. Asian groups continued to show interest in its 728 version in August 2004, but production was not restarted. Dornier 228 production was taken over by Swiss manufacturer RUAG, who then sold it off to General Atomics in 2020. Other subsidiaries became part of the EADS.

The medtech division was sold to an investment company and now bears the name Dornier MedTech. Dornier Medtech manufactures medical equipment, such as the &quot;Dornier S lithotripter&quot;, HM3, Compact Delta to treat kidney stones. Dornier MedTech also manufactures laser devices for a wide range of applications.

===Dornier Seaplane Company===
The Dornier family have a spin-off company and project, the Dornier Seastar. It is a turboprop-powered amphibious aircraft built largely of composite materials. This was developed by , and later by his son Cornado by Dornier Seawings.

===Dornier Technologie===
Claude&#x27;s grandson, , founded Dornier Technologie in 1996 to manufacture the Dornier S-Ray 007.

==Dornier Faint Object Camera==
Dornier GmbH built the Faint Object Camera for the Hubble Space Telescope, which was used from 1990 to 2002. The ESA funded the unit, which actually consists of two complete and independent camera systems designed to provide extremely high resolution, exceeding 0.05 arcseconds. It is designed to view very faint UV light from 115 to 650 nanometers in wavelength. It was the last original instrument on the Hubble when it was replaced by the Advanced Camera for Surveys in 2002.

<text>Caldwell County is a county in the U.S. state of North Carolina. It is located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. As of the 2020 census, the population was 80,652. Its county seat is Lenoir. Caldwell County is part of the Hickory-Lenoir-Morganton, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The county was formed in 1841 from parts of Burke County and Wilkes County. It was named for Joseph Caldwell, presiding professor and the first president of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

A series of reductions to the county&#x27;s territory have taken place since its initial formation. In 1847, parts of Caldwell County, Iredell County, and Wilkes County were combined to form Alexander County. In 1849, parts of Caldwell County, Ashe County, Wilkes County, and Yancey County were combined to form Watauga County. In 1861, parts of Caldwell County, Burke County, McDowell County, Watauga County, and Yancey County were combined to form Mitchell County.

<doc id="93336" wikidata="Q176307" url="?curid=93336" title="Cabarrus County, North Carolina">
<text>Cabarrus County ( ) is a county located in the south-central part of the U.S. state of North Carolina. As of the 2020 census, the population was 225,804, making it the 9th-most populous county in North Carolina. The county seat is Concord, which was incorporated in 1803. Cabarrus County is included in the Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, NC-SC Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The first substantiated gold find in America took place in Cabarrus County in 1799, when Conrad Reed discovered gold in Little Meadow Creek. The Reed Gold Mine (now a National Historic Landmark) was founded, and resulted in a gold rush to the area in the early 1800s. While some cotton plantations were established, most of the land was developed for subsistence farming. By 1860 the population consisted of about one-third enslaved African Americans, with few free people of color. Industrialization had started before the war with the introduction of textile mills to process the cotton. More mill development took place, especially after the railroad was constructed to the town. Coleman Manufacturing Company, started in 1897, is believed to be the first cotton mill in the nation to be built, owned and operated by African Americans. It was owned by Warren Clay Coleman from Concord, John C. Dancy (federal collector of customs), and seven partners primarily from Wilmington, North Carolina. Investors included Washington Duke and capitalists in other parts of the state. Textile manufacturing continued to be integral to the regional economy until the late 20th century. In 2015, the Coleman-Franklin-Cannon Mill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
The county was formed on December 29, 1792, from Mecklenburg County. Located in the Piedmont, it was named after Stephen Cabarrus of Chowan County, speaker of the North Carolina House of Commons.

Catawba Indians were the primary inhabitants of the area until beginning about 1750, the county was settled mainly by immigrants: Germans on the eastern side and Scotch-Irish in the western area of the county. When it came time to choose a location for the county seat and county government, each ethnic group wanted the county seat located close to their populations and could not reach agreement on a site. Stephen Cabarrus wrote to the citizens pleading with them to come together in peace to choose a location for their county seat. A central area of the county was chosen in 1796 and aptly named Concord, a derivative of two French words &quot;with&quot; and &quot;peace.&quot; Representative Paul Barringer introduced a bill into the state legislature to incorporate Concord; it passed on December 17, 1806. The town of Concord was begun on land owned by Samuel Huie and wife Jane Morrison Huie.

The first substantiated gold find in America was in 1799 by young Conrad Reed while playing in Little Meadow Creek, located on the Reed farm in southeastern Cabarrus County. According to research, Conrad&#x27;s find was a gold chunk approximately the size of a shoe and weighing 17 pounds. His father John Reed took the nugget into Concord to a silversmith, who informed Reed that the rock did not have any value. The elder Reed returned home with it, holding it for three years until a trip in 1802 to Fayetteville, where he sold the &quot;nugget&quot; to a jeweler for $3.50. Over time John Reed learned that the jeweler sold the large nugget for several thousand dollars. Reed returned to Fayetteville insisting on more just compensation. This discovery and news of the sale spurred the beginning of gold mining in the area.

John Reed, or Johannes Rieth as he is known in records of the &quot;Staatsarchiv&quot; at Marburg, Germany, was one of thousands of Hessian soldiers brought over by British troops to fight against rebellious colonists in the American Revolution. Reed deserted, as did many other Hessians. He traveled from Georgia to North Carolina, where he settled in an ethnic German community sometime around 1787 and began farming.

Reed first developed placer mining on his property, then underground mining, and became wealthy from the gold. His facility became known as Reed&#x27;s Gold Mine. Large amounts of gold were being discovered at the Reed Gold Mine and in other mines in the United States; these mine owners began to use their gold to create currency. For the government to retain control of the production of currency and keep a stabilized economic structure, President Andrew Jackson signed into legislation the authorization to create branches of the US Mint. The Charlotte Mint was built to handle the gold coming from the rich gold veins of North Carolina, including Reed&#x27;s.

The Reed Gold Mine was designated a National Historic Landmark, as it was the first gold mine in the country. Gold was mined in North Carolina into the early 20th century. Today visitors at the site can explore some of the mine&#x27;s reconstructed tunnels.

===Cabarrus Black Boys===
Prior to the battle of Alamance, on the 16th of May, 1771, the first blood shed in the American Revolution, there were many discreet men across North Carolina opposed to British taxation and fee system imposed by colonial officials in the late 1760s. Discreet persons part of this movement in Rowan and Mecklenburg Counties (later known as Cabarrus) took part in an infamous raid against a royal governmental military convoy as part of North Carolina&#x27;s Regulator Movement. On May 9, 1771, James, William and John White, brothers, and William White, a cousin, all born and raised on Rocky River, and one mile from Rocky River Church, Robert Caruthers, Robert Davis, Benjamin Cockrane, James and Joshua Hadley, William Alexander, of Sugar Creek “Captain Black Bill Alexander,” and whose sword now hangs in the Library Hall of Davidson College, bound themselves to a solemn oath of secrecy as they set out on a mission 

The small band of Regulators, disguised themselves and made their way to Phifer’s old muster grounds on Poplar Tent Road. After nightfall, the men laid a trail of gunpowder toward the royal government’s encampment and fired a shot igniting an explosion that was reportedly heard nine miles away. Two gunpowder wagons, as well as blankets, leggings, kettles, and other supplies were destroyed. Some men involved in this episode wore Indian disguises while others were blacked by the gunpowder they emptied from the kegs earning them the name of the &quot;Black Boys of Cabarrus&quot;. These young patriots remained active and in hiding until independence was declared.

===National Register of Historic Places===
The old Cabarrus County Courthouse was finished in 1876. Recognized as significant in the 20th century, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The Confederate soldiers monument is located on the front lawn area.

Also listed on the NRHP is the Coleman-Franklin-Cannon Mill, notable as the first cotton mill owned and operated by African Americans, and also for its decades-long record of industrial design in textile manufacturing, with numerous contributing structures built through the early 20th century.

Among other NRHP sites in Cabarrus County is the Bethel Church Arbor, located adjacent to Bethel United Methodist Church approximately one mile north of the historic crossroads (and railroad stop) of Cabarrus Station. The Arbor dates back to the early 1800s as a location for religious revival &quot;camp meetings&quot; and the current structure was built around 1878, and was in use through the 1920s.

===Agricultural and industrial development===
Located in the Piedmont region, the county was developed largely for subsistence farming, but did have some cotton plantations. By 1860 the population was about one-third enslaved African Americans, with few free people of color. The first cotton mill was constructed as early as 1839. More mill development took place after the American Civil War, when railroads reached the region.

Among the owners of new mills in the area were men of the rising black middle-class of Wilmington, North Carolina, such as John C. Dancy (appointed as collector of customs at the port), and others. Warren Clay Coleman, a Concord African-American businessman, joined them in organizing Coleman Manufacturing Company in 1897, on a site about two miles from Concord. They built and operated what is believed to have been the first cotton mill in the nation to be owned by blacks. They wanted to promote economic security for people of color. Richard B. Fitzgerald was its first president. While blacks had been hired for tobacco manufacturing, they were generally excluded from white-owned textile mills.

The Wilmington Insurrection of 1898, with white attacks on blacks, their homes and businesses, destroyed much of what the people had built there since the war. In 1900 Dancy was among more than 2000 blacks who left the city permanently after the riot, resulting in its becoming majority white. He moved to Washington, D.C., where he was appointed as the federal recorder of deeds.

Agriculture has played an important part in the economic life of the county for over 200 years. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, textiles became a vital part of the local economy, especially in the northern portion of the county. Today, the local economy has a more varied base.

<text>Burke County is a county located in the U.S. state of North Carolina. As of the 2020 census, its population was 87,570. Its county seat is Morganton.

Burke County is part of the Hickory-Lenoir-Morganton, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Indigenous peoples inhabited the interior and the coastal areas for thousands of years. Native Americans of the complex and far-flung Mississippian culture inhabited the county long before Europeans arrived in the New World. They were part of a trade network extending from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes. They built earthwork mounds, including at Joara, a site and regional chiefdom in North Carolina, near present-day Morganton. It was the center of the largest Native American settlement in North Carolina, dating from about 1000 AD and expanding into the next centuries.

In 1567, Spanish Juan Pardo&#x27;s expedition arrived and built Fort San Juan at Joara, claiming the area for the colony of Spanish Florida. Pardo named the settlement Cuenca, after his home city. They had been sent by the governor at Santa Elena (Parris Island) in South Carolina to find an overland route to the silver mines in central Mexico, believing that the Appalachians were connected to a range there.

Captain Juan Pardo, leader of the expedition, left about 30 soldiers at the fort while continuing his exploration. His expedition built another five forts to the west, in the foothills of the mountains. In the spring of 1568, the Indians attacked Fort San Juan, killing the soldiers and burning the fort. The natives killed all soldiers except one at the garrisons, at five other Spanish forts in the interior.

In 1777, during the American Revolutionary War, Burke County was formed from Rowan County. It was named for Thomas Burke, then serving as a delegate to the Continental Congress (1777 to 1781). He was later elected as governor of North Carolina, serving one term from 1781 to 1782. The western Piedmont was settled by many Scots-Irish and German immigrants in the mid- to late 18th century. They were generally yeoman farmers and fiercely independent.

As population increased, the county was divided to form other jurisdictions. In 1791, parts of Burke County and Rutherford County were combined to form Buncombe County. In 1833, parts of Burke and Buncombe Counties were combined to form Yancey County. In 1841, parts of Burke and Wilkes Counties were combined to form Caldwell County. In 1842, additional parts of Burke and Rutherford Counties were combined to form McDowell County. Finally, in 1861, parts of Burke, Caldwell, McDowell, Watauga, and Yancey Counties were combined to form Mitchell County.

The Burke County Regiment participated in the Battle of Kings Mountain, which pitted Appalachian frontiersmen against the Loyalist forces of British commander Ferguson at Kings Mountain, SC, in the American Revolution. Rather than waiting for Ferguson to invade their territory, militiamen throughout the Blue Ridge who crossed over the mountains to meet the enemy were known as the Over Mountain Men.

A record of the 1567 Spanish expedition was not discovered and translated into English until the late 20th century. In the 1990s, excavation was started at a site believed to be Joara, continuing into the 21st century. In 2013, archeologists announced that they had found remains of Fort San Juan at Joara, confirming early accounts. This has changed knowledge and interpretation of early European encounters and colonization efforts in what would become the United States, as Spanish efforts preceded the successful efforts of England in Jamestown, Virginia, by 40 years.

Burke County leans heavily Republican in presidential elections. The last Democrat to carry the county was Jimmy Carter in 1976. Lyndon Johnson, who won the county as a Democrat in 1964, was the only other one to do so since World War II. However, as late as the 1990s, Democratic presidential candidates have managed to garner 40% of the county&#x27;s vote. As was typical for all of the South outside the Appalachian highlands and a few stronghold Republican counties, Burke County was mostly solidly Democratic before World War II.

In the North Carolina House of Representatives, the northern two-thirds of Burke County comprises the 86th District represented by Republican Hugh Blackwell. The southern third lies within the 112nd district, which also covers Rutherford County and is represented by Republican David Rogers.

==In popular culture==
Although never explicitly mentioned by name in the novel, the hideout of Robur-the villain in Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Master of the World&quot;-is thought to be Table Rock Mountain in Burke County.

The outdoor drama &quot;From This Day Forward&quot; has been performed annually in Burke County since 1968. It tells the story of the founding of the town of Valdese.

Many scenes from the 1992 film &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; were filmed in Burke County. A full-scale fort was built next to the Linville boat access on Lake James for the filming. The fort was later destroyed and the land replanted with trees. Many of the extras who played settlers, British soldiers, and Native Americans were locals from Burke and surrounding counties.

The final scene from &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; had the backdrop filmed on Lake James, while the actors stayed in Hollywood.

In 2011, scenes for the Lionsgate adaptation of &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; were filmed near Hildebran, North Carolina, at the Henry River Mill Village.

<text>Buncombe County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of North Carolina. It is classified within Western North Carolina. The 2020 census reported the population was 269,452, making it the 7th-most populous county in North Carolina. Its county seat is Asheville. Buncombe County is part of the Asheville, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The area of modern day Buncombe County and its environs was originally populated by the Anigiduwagi, better known as the Cherokee people. Europeans, primarily of German, Scottish and English descent, began to live in Buncombe in the early 18th century. Some the earliest permanent European settlers in Buncombe arrived in 1784. These European settlers frequently broke their treaties with the Cherokee, gradually dispelling them from their land in Buncombe County by force.

In December 1792 and April 1793, John Dillard was a commissioner in a local political dispute of determining where the county seat of Buncombe County should be located. It was provided in an act creating Buncombe County for a committee of five persons to be appointed for the selection of the site. A dispute arose between two factions of Buncombe County residents on opposite sides of the Swannanoa River, one faction pressing for the county seat to be north of Swannanoa, which is now the center of Asheville, and the other faction demanding it to be at a place south of Swannanoa River, which later became known as the &quot;Steam Saw Mill Place&quot;, and is now the southern part of the city of Asheville.

Buncombe County was organized by European Americans after the American Revolutionary War in the home of Colonel William Davidson, a cousin of William Lee Davidson who was elected as the county&#x27;s first state senator. The first meeting of the county government took place in April 1792 in Colonel Davidson&#x27;s barn (located on the present-day Biltmore Estate).

At first, deeds were recorded in Morganton, the nearest county seat. That was inconvenient for residents as roads were poor. In December 1792, seven men met to select a courthouse location for the county. The first courthouse was built at the present-day Pack Square site in Asheville.

The county was formed in 1791 from parts of Burke and Rutherford counties. It was named for Edward Buncombe, a colonel in the American Revolutionary War who was captured at the Battle of Germantown. An earlier proposed name was &quot;Union County&quot;. The large county originally extended to the Tennessee line.

Many of the early settlers were Baptists. In 1807 the pastors of six churches, including the revivalist Sion Blythe, formed the French Broad Association of Baptist churches in the area.

As population increased in this part of the state, parts of the county were taken to organize new counties. In 1808 the western part of Buncombe County became Haywood County. In 1833 parts of Burke and Buncombe counties were combined to form Yancey County. In 1838 the southern part of what was left of Buncombe County became Henderson County. In 1851 parts of Buncombe and Yancey counties were combined to form Madison County. Finally, in 1925 the Broad River township of McDowell County was transferred to Buncombe County.

In 1820, a U.S. Congressman whose district included Buncombe County, unintentionally contributed a word to the English language. In the Sixteenth Congress, after lengthy debate on the Missouri Compromise, members of the House called for an immediate vote on that important question. Felix Walker rose to address his colleagues, insisting that his constituents expected him to make a speech &quot;for Buncombe.&quot; It was later remarked that Walker&#x27;s untimely and irrelevant oration was not just &quot;for&quot; Buncombe—it &quot;&quot;was&quot; Buncombe.&quot; &quot;Buncombe,&quot; afterwards spelled &quot;&quot; and later shortened to &quot;bunk,&quot; became a term for empty, nonsensical talk. That, in turn, is the etymology of the verb &quot;&quot;.

In September 2024, Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic, record-breaking flooding throughout Buncombe County and Western North Carolina. 47 deaths were recorded in Buncombe County as a result of the storm, the most of any county in the US. Prior to the storm, the county was classified by FEMA as being at low risk of deadly hurricanes.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Buncombe county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.52%) is water.

The French Broad River enters the county at its border with Henderson County to the south and flows north into Madison County. The source of the Swannanoa River, which joins the French Broad River in Asheville, is in northeast Buncombe County near Mount Mitchell, a part of the Black Mountains range. Mt. Mitchell is the highest point in the eastern United States at 6,684 ft. Its summit lies in adjacent Yancey County; the highest point in Buncombe County is Potato Knob, at 6400+ feet, which lies a short distance south of Mount Mitchell.

A milestone was achieved in 2003 when Interstate 26, still called Future I-26 in northern Buncombe County, was extended from Mars Hill (north of Asheville) to Johnson City, Tennessee. This completed a 20-year, half-billion dollar construction project through the Blue Ridge Mountains.

There are four colleges in Buncombe County, including Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College, University of North Carolina at Asheville, Montreat College, and Warren Wilson College.

====Sheriff&#x27;s Office and policing====
The Buncombe County Sheriff provides court protection and jail administration for the entire county and provides patrol and detective services for the unincorporated areas of the county. The Sheriff&#x27;s Office is organized into six divisions: Enforcement, Detention, Animal Control, Support Operations, School Resources, Civil Process. The current Sheriff is Quentin Miller who was elected in 2018. Asheville has a municipal police department, with David Zack named as the Chief of Police in 2020. The municipalities of Black Mountain, Biltmore Forest, Montreat, Weaverville, and Woodfin also have municipal police departments, and UNC Asheville and Montreat College have campus police departments.

===State politics===
As of 2023, in the North Carolina Senate, Julie Mayfield (D–49th) and Warren Daniel (R–46th) both represent parts of Buncombe County. Mayfield represents most of the county including Asheville and the west side. Daniel represents a portion of the east side of the county as well as McDowell and Burke counties.

In the North Carolina House of Representatives, Eric Ager (D–114th), Lindsey Prather (D–115th), and Caleb Rudow (D–116th) each represent part of the county.

===Federal politics===
Buncombe had long been a bellwether county in presidential elections. It voted for the winning candidate in all but one election from 1928 until 2012, with the exception being 1960.

Since 2008, the county has trended strongly toward the Democratic Party. It swung from a 0.6 point win for George W. Bush to a 14-point win for Barack Obama in 2008, and has gone Democratic by double-digit margins at every election since then. This includes 2016, when it voted for Hillary Clinton. When Donald Trump won the electoral college (and the election) after losing the popular vote, the county lost its bellwether status. In 2024, Kamala Harris achieved the strongest performance by a Democrat in the county since Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s 1964 landslide. Despite losing North Carolina overall, she pushed the county two points further to the left.

North Carolina is represented in the United States Senate by Republicans Ted Budd and Thom Tillis, from Advance and Huntersville, respectively. All of the county is located in North Carolina&#x27;s 11th congressional district, which is currently held by Republican Chuck Edwards.

<text>Brunswick County is a county located in the U.S. state of North Carolina. It is the southernmost county in the state. As of the 2020 census, the population was 136,693. Its population was only 73,143 in 2000, making it one of the fastest-growing counties in the state. With a nominal growth rate of approximately 47% in ten years, much of the growth is centered in the eastern section of the county in the suburbs of Wilmington such as Leland, Belville and Southport. The county seat is Bolivia, which at a population of around 150 people is among the least populous county seats in the state.

Brunswick County is part of the Wilmington, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area. From 2013 to 2023, the county was part of the Myrtle Beach-Conway-North Myrtle Beach, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area. During that time, Brunswick County and Wilmington area leaders disputed the change, including many government leaders like Senator Richard Burr. Ultimately, their efforts were a success because the county was added back into the MSA after a 2023 realignment.

Much of the economy of the county is built around tourism, with beach communities lying along the south-facing beaches past Cape Fear such as Bald Head Island (the southernmost point of North Carolina) and Oak Island being popular destinations. Calabash, on the border of South Carolina, is renowned for its fried seafood, with &quot;Calabash-style&quot; restaurants dotting the region. The proximity to Cinespace Wilmington in nearby Wilmington has made Brunswick County a popular filming location for many movies and TV shows.

==History==
The county was formed in 1764 from parts of Bladen County and New Hanover County. It was named for the colonial port of Brunswick Town, which itself was named for George I, the King of England and Duke of Brunswick.

Following the destruction of Brunswick Town during the American Revolutionary War, the southern portion of the county increased in population, with the town of Smithville being incorporated in 1805. Three years later it was designated the county seat. During the antebellum era, Brunswick experienced some growth. The slave labor force increased to serve plantations in their production of naval stores, corn, cotton, and rice; by 1860 over 44 percent of the county&#x27;s population were slaves. During the American Civil War, forces of the Confederate State of America erected Fort Anderson near the ruins of Brunswick Town to defend against federal attacks on the Cape Fear River and the Port of Wilmington. Brunswick County did not experience much growth in the latter half of the 19th century. Smithville was renamed Southport in 1887. Beginning in the 1930s, development along the county&#x27;s beaches occurred, and between 1955 and 1975, six communities on the county&#x27;s barrier islands were incorporated.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (19.00%) is water. It is the fourth-largest county in North Carolina by total area. The Brunswick River and the Cape Fear River provide access to the Atlantic Ocean.

The Brunswick Nuclear Generating Station is to the north of Southport.

==Government and politics==
Brunswick County is a member of the regional Cape Fear Council of Governments.

The county lies in the inner coastal plain, most of which was highly pro-secession, and part of the Democratic Solid South from the late 19th century through 1964. However, Brunswick County was less fertile than the “Black Belt” and consequently had significant pro-Union and Populist sympathies. The county frequently backed Republicans at state and local levels even when the state was consistently Democratic apart from Herbert Hoover’s 1928 victory. Only three times since the Civil War – Grover Cleveland in 1888, Alton B. Parker in 1904 and Jimmy Carter in 1980 – has Brunswick County backed a losing Democratic presidential candidate. Carter in that 1980 election remains the last Democrat to win a majority of Brunswick County’s ballots, although Bill Clinton won a plurality in 1992. In recent years the county has reliably favored Republican candidates, though in 2024, elections for local office were competitive. In the 2024 North Carolina elections, Brunswick voters favored Republicans for state legislative seats and the county commission, but favored a Democratic gubernatorial candidate for the first time since 2004.













==Economy==
Due to its rapidly growing population, the economy in Brunswick County is relatively robust and growing. Jobs in the food service and retail sectors have experienced the greatest expansion in the recent past. Owing to the large presence of retirees, a substantial amount of income in the county is generated through the collection of dividends from investments and various benefits including pensions and Social Security payments. Less than half of county residents participate in the work force. Of those that do, a significant proportion commute outside the county for work.

==Culture== 
The town of Calabash is nationally known for its style of lightly-breaded fried seafood. The town of Navassa is a historically Gullah community, though due to frequent contact with the outside world and involvement in industry the descendants of Gullah people in the area do not speak the Gullah language.

<text>Bertie County ( ) is a county located in the northeast area of the U.S. state of North Carolina. As of the 2020 census, the population was 17,934. Its county seat is Windsor. The county was created in 1722 as Bertie Precinct and gained county status in 1739.

==History==
The county was formed as Bertie Precinct in 1722 from the part of Chowan Precinct of Albemarle County lying west of the Chowan River. It was named for James Bertie, his brother Henry Bertie, or perhaps both, each having been one of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina.

In 1729 parts of Bertie Precinct, Chowan Precinct, Currituck Precinct, and Pasquotank Precinct of Albemarle County were combined to form Tyrrell Precinct. With the abolition of Albemarle County in 1739, all of its constituent precincts became separate counties. As population of settlers increased, in 1741 parts of Bertie County were organized as Edgecombe County and Northampton County. Finally, in 1759 parts of Bertie, Chowan, and Northampton counties were combined to form Hertford County. Bertie&#x27;s boundaries have remained the same since then.

This mostly rural county depended on the agricultural economy well into the 20th century. In the colonial and antebellum eras, tobacco and cotton were the chief commodity crops, worked by Indian and African slaves. After the Civil War, agriculture continued to be important to the county. In the 21st century, developers have referred to it as being within the Inner Banks region, which is increasingly attracting retirees and buyers of second homes, because of its beaches and landscapes.

==Government and politics==

Beaufort is a typical “Solid South” county in its voting patterns. It voted Democratic consistently up through 1964, even resisting the lure of voting against Al Smith’s Catholic faith and opposition to Prohibition in 1928 when North Carolina went Republican for the only time between 1876 and 1964. However, the increasing social and racial liberalism of the Democratic Party turned its electorate to George Wallace in 1968 and overwhelmingly to Richard Nixon against George McGovern four years later. Since then, Beaufort has been a strongly Republican county, with the last Democrat to carry it being Jimmy Carter in 1976.

Beaufort County is a member of the Mid-East Commission regional council of governments.

<text>Avery County is a county located in the U.S. state of North Carolina. As of the 2020 census, the population was 17,806. The county seat is Newland. The county seat was initially established in Elk Park when the county was first formed, but was moved to Newland upon completion of the courthouse in 1912. Founded in 1911, it is the youngest of North Carolina&#x27;s 100 counties.

==History==
The county is the newest of North Carolina&#x27;s 100 counties. It was formed in 1911 from parts of Caldwell County, Mitchell County, and Watauga County. It was named for Waightstill Avery, a colonel in the American Revolutionary War and the first Attorney General of North Carolina (1777–1779). It is often noted for the large amount of Christmas trees that the county produces. The county seat was originally in the town of Elk Park, which was then the largest town in the county, located on the county&#x27;s north end, on the Tennessee line. Upon completion of the county&#x27;s courthouse in 1912, the seat was moved to the central location of what was then an unincorporated area known as Fields of Toe, for the meadows along the head of the Toe River, in what is now the incorporated Town of Newland. The town was so named for then Lt. Gov. William Newland, an influential Democrat, who helped garner support in the then heavily Democratic legislature in Raleigh, for Avery County, an overwhelmingly pro-Union Republican area, becoming the state&#x27;s 100th and final county.

According to local legend, Elk Park citizens were upset at the decision to move of the county seat from their town, and they refused to give up the books. The then-sheriff, like all county officials, was a Democrat and an interim appointee of the Democratic governor in Raleigh, who would hold office from July 1, 1911, until the next election cycle in late 1912, when the almost all-Republican electorate would undoubtedly vote in all Republicans as local officials. The sheriff was leery of confronting the irate local Elk Park citizens, so his wife baked cookies and had their pastor deliver them as a peace offering. The citizens then cheerfully handed over the books, which were sent to the new offices at the new courthouse in Newland.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.06%) is water.

Avery County is extremely rural and mountainous with all of the county&#x27;s terrain located within the Appalachian Mountains range; with a mean altitude of it is the second-highest county east of the Mississippi behind nearby Haywood County. The highest point in the county is Grassy Ridge Bald, above sea level. Most of Grandfather Mountain, whose highest point is Calloway Peak on the tri-point bordering Watauga and Caldwell Counties, is within Avery County. At , Beech Mountain (also shared with Watauga County) is the highest incorporated community east of the Mississippi River, while at Newland is the highest county seat in the Eastern United States.

The county&#x27;s superintendent of schools is Dr. Dan Brigman. The School Board is located on NC 194 near the Newland city limits. It also houses the school bus garage, support staff and other school system administrative offices.

===Government buildings===
Overlooking Avery Square is the historic 1912 Avery County Courthouse. The square, includes monuments to fallen peace officers, fallen firefighters and as of 2016, a large veteran&#x27;s memorial. The courthouse was remodeled in 1996 and again in 2014, to add more office space and a second smaller courtroom. The courthouse is located on Shultz Circle and Glenn Hicks Lane, which was renamed from Jail Street, in honor of Avery Sheriff&#x27;s Deputy Lt. Glenn H. Hicks, who was murdered in the line of duty in 2003.

The courthouse also houses local office of the North Carolina Probation and Parole Division, judges offices and chambers, district attorney&#x27;s sub-office, the county map office, tax office, inspection office, register of deeds, clerk of superior court, guardian ad litem and North Carolina juvenile justice department. Connected to the courthouse is the sheriff&#x27;s office and the county jail, an elections office, county 911 emergency dispatch center and magistrate&#x27;s courtroom.

The county administrative building provides work space for the county manager and many other county offices such as social services, payroll, finance, veterans services, fire marshal, emergency management, waste management, technology and personnel. In 1997, a second courtroom and a small magistrate&#x27;s courtroom at the courthouse was created.

The Avery County Sheriff&#x27;s Office provides law enforcement protection to the entire county. The county has no police department. The Sheriff also provides security to the courts and courthouse, serves civil orders of the courts and operates the jail complex.

Other county services includes a 911 emergency dispatch center that provides service to all county law enforcement (Sheriff&#x27;s office, 6 town police departments and three company police agencies, plus communications support to the NC Highway Patrol Troopers, NC Wildlife officers, state alcohol agents and state park rangers assigned locally), fire, EMS and rescue services in the county. The county building also houses county fire marshal and emergency management offices, a veteran&#x27;s services office and an office of economic development, along with staffed trash collection sites throughout the county and a landfill.

==Politics==
Owing to its Appalachian highland location, rural character, and powerful Unionist sympathies from the Civil War (1861-1865), Avery County has continually voted overwhelmingly Republican in Presidential elections, even during the Solid South Democratic era. Since the county&#x27;s formation in 1911, no Democratic presidential candidate has obtained forty percent of the county&#x27;s vote, and only Lyndon Johnson in 1964 and Jimmy Carter in 1976 have received so much as thirty percent. An illustration of Avery County&#x27;s rock-ribbed Republicanism can be seen in 1936 when Alf Landon won the county by 55.96 percentage points, making it Landon&#x27;s fifth-strongest county in the nation despite Landon losing North Carolina to Franklin Roosevelt by 46.80 percent.











Avery County is represented in the 47th district of the North Carolina Senate, represented by Republican Ralph Hise, and the 85th district of the North Carolina House of Representatives, represented by Republican Dudley Greene.

==Economy==
The county contains local attractions such as Grandfather Mountain, Grandfather Mountain State Park, Linville Gorge Wilderness, Linville Falls, Pisgah National Forest and the Blue Ridge Parkway, which all attract large numbers of visitors. In October, the annual &quot;Wooly Worm&quot; festival at the old school in downtown Banner Elk draws world visitors who come to see caterpillar races that locals happily claim can predict the severity of coming winters based on the fur coats of the worms. The Grandfather Mountain Highland Games is held each year the first full weekend after July 4 and is one of the largest Scottish gatherings outside Scotland and features bagpipes, bands, Scottish food, music, authentic clothing and games such as log and caber toss and use of dogs in sheep herding. Also in October is Oz Days at the former Land of Oz theme park on Beech Mountain in the fall also attracts visitors who love the legacy of the famous Judy Garland movie &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; based on Frank Baum&#x27;s famous book. Oktoberfest on Sugar Mountain and Beech Mountain also in October draw large crowds and the annual Music Festival in Newland on July 4 also attracts many visitors.

Ski Resorts are immensely popular tourist destinations in the cold winter months when snowfall and man-made snow create ideal skiing conditions. Sugar Mountain Ski Resort, located in Sugar Mountain, and Ski Beech Resort, located in Beech Mountain, provide multiple winter actives including skiing, snowboarding, snow tubing and ice skating. Hawks Nest Tubing Resort, located in Seven Devils offers snow tubing.

Second homes, gated communities, condominiums, rental properties, hotel-motel lodging, bed and breakfasts, campgrounds and real estate in general all are critically important sources of jobs, income and tax revenue. The brilliant fall colors or the foliage of the surrounding mountains, winter sports, mountain bicycling, hiking, horseback riding, warm weather camping, hiking, wildlife viewing, hunting and searching for geological finds all make for a year-round tourism-generated and regular real estate market.

Major Employers: The State of North Carolina is the largest employer in the county. It operates a forestry center, DOT office, State Highway Patrol office, state agriculture extension office, probation/parole office, alcohol law enforcement office, a state park service office and two prisons in lower Avery County on the Mitchell County border. Those side-by-side facilities are Mountain View and Avery-Mitchell. A third prison facility, the BRIDGE Unit, was a novel project to use non-violent, first-time youthful felony offenders to work on state lands and fight forest fires as &quot;smoke jumpers.&quot; It was closed in the late 1990s and torn down. Other major employers are: the Avery County School System, Mayland Community College, Cannon Memorial Hospital, Lees-McRae College, Avery County government, Lowes Foods, Unimin, Beech and Sugar Mountain Resorts, the YMCA of Avery County, and various large tree farms and mining operations which are also important local employers.

The Avery Fairgrounds is located on Vale Road, just outside the Newland city limits. It is funded both by allocated county funds and private funding and controlled by a fair board. The Avery County Agricultural and Horticultural Fair has been an annual event in early September of each year and draws huge crowds to the site for rides, displays and other events.

Avery County is one of 420 counties and eight independent cities that fall into the Appalachian Region as defined by the US Government&#x27;s Appalachian Regional Council (ARC). ARC was founded by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 to address poverty in the 13 Eastern states of Appalachia. Avery is listed as &quot;Transitional&quot; by the ARC. Based on 2006 statistics from the US Government, the five classification categories for factors such as unemployment, income and poverty rate, the levels are: Distressed (worst), At-risk, Transitional, Competitive and Attainment. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate as of August 2013 was 10.6% (not seasonally adjusted), down from 11.2% for 2012. According to Census American Community Survey data for 2011 the poverty rate is listed at 18.1%.

===Agriculture===
The county&#x27;s agricultural focus is the mass production of Fraser Fir Christmas Trees. Tree farms produce trees year round and they are harvested in mid October, wrapped, stacked and sold in bulk at local or far away lots or shipped to wholesalers across the country. Some farms also sell directly to visitors. Shrubbery, landscaping and greenhouses all are important agricultural aspects of the county&#x27;s economy, as is beef cattle farming.

In keeping with a growing trend in the NC mountains and foothills, grape growing and vineyards are becoming popular with three vineyards presently operating in the county in Banner Elk, Plumtree and Linville Falls.

===Aviation===
Avery County Airport (7A8) is a small, public general aviation facility with no control tower. It primarily serves private aircraft and has no regularly scheduled commercial or cargo flights or major carriers. The facility jointly serves Avery and Mitchell Counties and is located on Grassy Creek Road, just off US19E near the Mitchell County Line in Green valley, 10 miles south of Newland and 4 miles east of Spruce Pine. It is jointly operated by both counties and has a 3000-foot-long runway that is 60 feet wide, with over runs at both ends in excess of 110 feet. The facility has private contractors who offer private air services, flying lessons and charter flights. The airport has seen increased usage in recent years and has been upgraded several times. The county has made cursory inquiries into resurfacing the airport to a heavier weight rating, to allow NC Air National Guard C-130 aircraft from Charlotte Douglass International Airport Air National Guard Base to conduct intermittent landing and &quot;touch and go&quot; combat exercises. The US Marine Corps on the NC coast at New River and Cherry Point Air Stations has also expressed an interest in conducting mountain landing training for Osprey vertical takeoff aircraft if the airport runway is thickened, as has the NC Army National Guard for its helicopters located in Salisbury. The Avery County runway is of sufficient length to accommodate large military aircraft, but not of sufficient surface thickness. Mission Hospital in Asheville has also been approached to possibly establish an air ambulance base at the airport.

A smaller private airport is also located in Banner Elk parallel to NC 194 at the Elk River Club resort; which is for residents and approved guests of the Elk River Property Owners Association. Avery County Transportation (ACT) provides general public transportation vans for a fee. The service is by call, offering rides to various locations in the county and out-of-county medical rides. The transportation office and garage is located on NC 194, just north of the Newland city limits.

Avery County Schools has eight schools housed on seven campuses, ranging from pre-kindergarten to twelfth grade: five elementary schools, two middle schools and a central high school. Avery High School has close to 700 students and is located near Newland. It is scheduled for large-scale renovations by 2023. Avery High has a dual enrolment partnership program with Mayland Community College, which allows students to earn college credits while still in high school. The two county middle schools are: Avery Middle across from the High School built in 1978 and Cranberry Middle in Cranberry on a joint campus with Freedom Trail elementary near Elk Park was built in 1998. Other county elementary schools are located in: Newland, Crossnore Elementary was built on a new campus in 2003, Riverside Elementary in lower western Avery built in 1987 and Banner Elk Elementary.

Three small local high schools were closed in 1969 with the opening of the present central Avery County High School near Newland. Crossnore High School was torn down in the early 1970s. The largest of the old high schools, Cranberry High School, is now preserved as a community center in Cranberry near Elk Park. Numerous older historic rock work schools built by the Depression-era Work Projects Administration (WPA) that had been community K-8 schools were closed, starting with the old Riverside School in 1987. Both Elk Park School and Minneapolis Schools were closed in 1998 and consolidated into the new Cranberry Middle-Freedom trail School. Beech Mountain school was the last K-8 school in Avery County. It was closed in 2008 and is now a community center. The area students were moved to Cranberry Middle-Freedom Trail School. The last WPA school still operating in the county was the old downtown Banner Elk School, which closed in 2011 and reopened on a new campus located between Banner Elk and Sugar Mountain.

Two authorized charter schools operate in Avery County:
* Crossnore Academy, formerly an orphanage in the Town of Crossnore
* Grandfather Academy, formerly Grandfather Home Orphanage in Banner Elk

==Media==
Based in Newland, the &quot;Avery Post&quot; and &quot;Avery Journal-Times&quot; cover all of Avery County. The &quot;Avery Journal-Times&quot; newspaper is owned by Jones Media publishing company and is a sister publication of the &quot;Watauga Democrat&quot; in Boone, while the &quot;Post&quot; is locally owned 

WECR radio station at 1130 on the AM dial serves the local area with local programs and religious music, along with local news, events and weather.

Television coverage is primarily based out of , which the county is in its Designated Market Area (DMA). However, because of proximity, several stations in the also cover the area and are carried on local cable.

==Medical==
The county&#x27;s public hospital is Charles A. Cannon Memorial Hospital in Linville, a campus of Appalachian Healthcare System, headquartered at Watauga Medical Center in Boone. The hospital is centrally located in Linville and opened in 2000, to consolidate and replace the old Cannon Hospital located in Banner Elk and Sloop Hospital located in Crossnore. The new campus also hosts the Sloop Medical Building, which houses various doctor&#x27;s and dentist&#x27;s offices, the local YMCA complex, and a pharmacy. The hospital is a critical care facility with a 24-hour emergency department as well as imagery, lab, surgery, and other services. Critical illnesses and injuries and trauma patients are often stabilized at Cannon, then are flown or transported by ambulance to hospitals in Charlotte, Asheville, or Johnson City, Tennessee. The hospital formerly had 25 medical beds, but now has 8 since the opening of Appalachian Regional Behavioral Health hospital in late 2021.

Appalachian Regional Behavioral Health Hospital (ARBH) is an independent psychiatric hospital built to accommodate increasing demand for mental health services in the area. It expands on the former 10 bed psychiatric unit of Cannon Hospital with 27 total beds and a triage area where patients can walk in for an assessment to determine if inpatient care is necessary. 

Blue Ridge Hospital, a Mission Health care System campus, located just beyond Avery County in the neighboring Mitchell County town of Spruce Pine, also serves the lower portion of Avery County.

The Avery County Emergency Medical Service (EMS) is a full-time county department (since 1994). They provide paramedic-level emergency medical care via three ambulances and a supervisor&#x27;s SUV at all times, at station locations across the county. Backup is provided by fire departments, a rescue squad and law enforcement first responders.

<text>Ashe County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of North Carolina. The population was 26,577 at the 2020 census. Its county seat is Jefferson.

==History==
Historical evidence shows that Ashe County was inhabited by Native Americans, which included the Cherokee, Creek, and Shawnee tribes. Pieces of broken pottery, arrowheads, and other Native American artifacts have been found, indicating their presence. Most of these artifacts have been found in the Old Fields area of Ashe County.

The earliest Europeans to explore Ashe County were Bishop August Gottlieb Spangenberg – head of the Moravian Church in America – and his associates, Timothy Horsefield, Joseph Mueller, Henry Antes, Johan Merck, and Herman Loesch. Bishop Spangenberg wrote about his journey in Ashe in a diary that has been preserved by the Moravian church. He was given in Virginia as a place for his fellow Moravians to settle. The only one of Spangenberg&#x27;s group to return and permanently settle in Ashe County was Herman Loesch. Other early settlers were David Helton, William Walling, William McLain and Daniel Boone, the famous pioneer. With the exception of Boone, these men and their families all settled in Ashe in 1771.

During the Revolutionary War one skirmish was fought in Ashe County, the Battle of Big Glades. The battle was fought in July 1780 between a force of Americans, led by Captain Robert Love, and a force of 150 British Loyalists on their way to Charlotte to join Lord Cornwallis, the British commander in the Southern colonies. The Americans won the skirmish.

In the 1780s, Ashe County was a part of the self-declared &quot;State of Franklin&quot;, within the boundaries of its Washington County. The &quot;State of Franklin&quot; marked the beginnings of the State of Tennessee. The North Carolina legislature created Ashe County in late 1799 with an area of . Many family surnames noted in the 1800 Ashe County Census, such as Bare, Barker, Blevins, Hart, Stamper, Miller, Burkett, Gambill, Baldwin, and Ballou, are still present today. Ashe County was named in honor of Samuel Ashe, a Revolutionary patriot, a superior court judge, and the Governor of North Carolina from 1795 to 1798.

From 1807 to 1913, the county went through numerous boundary changes. In 1849, to form Watauga County, the southwestern part of Ashe County was combined with parts of Caldwell County, Wilkes County, and Yancey County. Ten years later in 1859, the eastern part of the remainder of Ashe County became Alleghany County.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.72%) is water.

Ashe County is located in extreme northwestern North Carolina. The county is bordered by two states: Virginia on the north; and Tennessee to the west. The county is located entirely within the Appalachian Mountains region of North Carolina. Most of the county is located atop a rolling plateau that ranges from above sea level. On the county&#x27;s southeastern border the land drops sharply to about in neighboring Wilkes County, North Carolina. Numerous mountains and hills dot the plateau. In total, five mountains in the county rise to over . A prominent landmark is Mount Jefferson, which is a State Natural Area and rises to , and towers more than above the towns of Jefferson and West Jefferson.

The county&#x27;s main river is the New River, one of the oldest rivers in the world, and one of the few major rivers in the southeastern United States to flow primarily north instead of south, east, or west. 34 creeks and streams flow into the New River in Ashe County. In 1998, the river was designated an &quot;American Heritage River&quot; by President Bill Clinton, and it is famed for its beautiful rural scenery, clear water, fly fishing, and kayaking and canoeing.

Isolated by mountainous terrain from the remainder of North Carolina to the east, Ashe County was described in the 19th and early 20th centuries as one of the Lost Provinces of North Carolina.

Ashe County generally is known for its mountain scenery, and the tourism industry is an important mainstay of the county&#x27;s economy. The Blue Ridge Parkway runs along the county&#x27;s southeastern border. Ashe County has historically consisted of rural farmland, with numerous cattle and poultry farms. However, cattle farming in recent decades has given way to the industry of raising Christmas trees. Many cattle farmers have switched to growing Christmas trees. In 1997, 2007, 2008, 2012, 2021, and 2023, an Ashe County Christmas tree was selected as the official White House Christmas Tree by the National Christmas Tree Association. The tree is put on display in the Blue Room (White House). As of 2014, Ashe County grows more Christmas trees than any other county in the Eastern United States.

===Climate===
Ashe County has a considerably different climate than most of the southeastern United States. Summers typically average around 80 °F (27 °C). Temperatures rarely exceed 90 °F (32 °C), but on rare occasions can reach the mid-90s °F (~35 °C) as they did in 2012—the most recent that 90 °F+ (32 °C+) was observed. 100 °F+ (38 °C+) has never been observed. Summer nights are cool, and temperatures often dip to near 60 °F (16 °C), even in July. In winter there is snow, averaging about 30 inches (0.76 meters) for the towns of Jefferson and West Jefferson during the past thirty years. Considerably more snow falls on the peaks and the western slopes of the Appalachian Mountains. During the 2009–2010 snow season, Jefferson received some 60 inches (1.52 meters) of snow. Snow has been observed as early as around October 1 and as late as around May 1. Ashe County is also a very windy location, especially in winter, when several times each year the Jefferson Airport sees winds gusting 60 to 85 MPH (97 to 137 KPH). Combined with the winds typical for the region, Ashe County can also see extremely cold temperatures during winter. In January 2014, the low temperature dipped below 0 °F (−18 °C) several times, the coldest being −8 °F (−22 °C) on January 30–31. During Winter Storm Elliott in December 2022, Ashe County recorded an atypical low of −15 °F (−26 °C). Single digit temperatures, often just above zero Fahrenheit, are observed occasionally in the winter months. The average winter high is around 45 °F (7 °C), with an average winter low near 20 °F (−7 °C). Despite its southerly latitude, these factors can make Ashe County experience winter conditions typically seen in the northeastern United States.

The USDA hardiness zones range from Zone 6A (−10 °F to −5 °F or −23 °C to −21 °C) in northwestern Ashe County, to Zone 7B (5 °F to 10 °F or −15 °C to −12 °C) in areas along the county&#x27;s southeastern border with Wilkes County.

<text>Alleghany County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of North Carolina. The population was 10,888 at the 2020 census. Its county seat is Sparta.

==History==

The earliest inhabitants of the area eventually comprising Alleghany County were Cherokee and Shawnee Native Americans. By the late 1700s these people had been displaced by English, German, and Scotch-Irish settlers. The county was formed in 1859 from the eastern part of Ashe County. A group of commissioners selected a site near the center of the county to build a courthouse and established the county seat of Sparta. The county was expanded through annexations at the expense of its neighbors from 1869 and 1903. A portion was moved to Wilkes County in 1909.

In 1894, textile executive Hugh Chatham pushed for the founding of a resort in Roaring Gap. It was reorganized in 1925.

The construction of the Blue Ridge Parkway in the 1930s led to increased tourism and growth in Alleghany County. In 1936, the regional Blue Ridge Electric Membership Corporation was founded with the support of the Rural Electrification Act, leading to the eventual expansion of electric utility service in Alleghany. In 1944, the county&#x27;s first major manufacturer—D&amp;P Pipe Works—opened after relocating from Chicago to Sparta to be closer to supplies of local mountain laurel roots which were used during World War II in the production of wooden tobacco pipes. Due to unreliable electricity, the company relied on its own generator for power, but utility service improved after the war.

Alleghany County&#x27;s economy grew in the 30 years following World War II with the expansion of manufacturing, aided by the improved electricity service and outside companies&#x27; desire to locate their facilities in areas with lower land costs, fewer regulations, and less competitive wages. Tourism also grew with the construction of new summer vacation homes. Service-oriented businesses cropped up along U.S. Route 21 to accommodate travelers driving north out of the state. Use of the highway decreased after Interstate 77 was completed in 1975. D&amp;P Pipe Works, later renamed Dr. Grabow, peaked with about 350 employees before health concerns regarding tobacco smoking led to a decline in demand for pipes in the late 20th century. Between 2000 and 2005, the county lost 60 percent of its manufacturing jobs.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.60%) is water. It is the fifth-smallest county in North Carolina by total area.

The highest point in the county is Peach Bottom Mountain - Catherine Knob at above sea level. The major rivers of Alleghany County are the New River, and the Little River; the latter flows through the town of Sparta, the county seat.

Isolated by mountainous terrain from the remainder of North Carolina to the east, Alleghany County was described in the 19th and early 20th centuries as one of the Lost Provinces of North Carolina.

<text>Alexander County is a county established in the U.S. state of North Carolina in 1847. As of the 2020 census, the population was 36,444. Its county seat is Taylorsville. Alexander County is part of the Hickory-Lenoir-Morganton, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Alexander County was formed in 1847 from portions of what were then Iredell County (formed in 1788 from Rowan County), Caldwell County (formed from Burke County in 1841), and Wilkes County (formed from Surry County and Washington District in 1771).

Alexander County was named for William Julius Alexander who was a Speaker of the North Carolina House of Commons. This Piedmont area was settled primarily by farmers, many of Scots-Irish descent, as well as German descent in the southern section of Alexander County.
The county was established by two acts of the North Carolina General Assembly, one ratified on January 15 and one ratified on January 18, 1847. These acts were not to take effect until it was determined that Caldwell County would have 5,000 people in it. On August 10–11, 1847, the first sale of land in the county seat (Taylorsville) took place. Taylorsville is the namesake of either John Louis Taylor, Carolina agriculturist and political philosopher, or General Zachary Taylor, the twelfth president of the United States.
With the proceeds from the sale, the county built the first courthouse on the present site.

When the American Civil War began in 1861, Alexander County was fourteen years old. The court house records in Taylorsville were destroyed by troops under Major General George Stoneman in a raid on Easter Sunday in 1865.

The Alexander Railroad based in Taylorsville began in 1946, with one connection to Norfolk Southern in Statesville, North Carolina. The short line rail system operates between Taylorsville and Statesville.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.39%) is water.

Alexander County is located within the Foothills region of western North Carolina. The county&#x27;s main geographic feature is the Brushy Mountains, a deeply eroded spur of the Blue Ridge Mountains to the west. The &quot;Brushies,&quot; as they are called locally, rise from 300 to above the surrounding countryside, and dominate the county&#x27;s northern horizon. The highest point in Alexander County is Hickory Knob in the Brushies; it has an elevation of above sea level. Barrett Mountain, an isolated mountain ridge, is in the western part of the county. The remainder of Alexander County&#x27;s terrain consists of gently rolling countryside. The county&#x27;s largest river, the Catawba, forms its southern border.

Within Alexander County is the unincorporated town of Hiddenite, the location of a mine that yields emeralds, sapphires, and its namesake stone &quot;hiddenite,&quot; a variety of spodumene.

The county is served by US Highway 64, a controlled-access roadway connecting Taylorsville with Lenoir and Statesville. NC Highways 90, 16, and 127 also serve the county. Interstate 40 and 77 are 30 minutes from the majority of county residents. The Charlotte Douglas International Airport is an hour&#x27;s drive from most parts of the county. The area is also served by the Hickory Regional Airport (30 minutes) and the Statesville Airport (20 minutes). The Alexander Railroad Company is an active short-line rail system operating between Taylorsville and Statesville, and connecting with Norfolk Southern.

In contrast, Hillary Clinton in 2016 obtained barely twenty percent of the county&#x27;s vote. The county did vote mainly Democratic during the Third Party System, but Populist sentiments in the 1890s have meant the county has supported the party only five times since 1896.

<text>Alamance County () is a county in North Carolina. As of the 2020 census, the population was 171,415. Its county seat is Graham. Formed in 1849 from Orange County to the east, Alamance County has been the site of significant historical events, textile manufacturing, and agriculture.

Alamance County comprises the Burlington, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Greensboro–Winston-Salem–High Point, NC Combined Statistical Area, which had an estimated population of 1,736,099 in 2023.

==History==
Before being formed as a county, the region had at least one known small Southeastern tribe of Native Americans in the 18th century, the Sissipahaw, who lived in the area bounded by modern Saxapahaw, the area known as the Hawfields, and the Haw River. European settlers entered the region in the late 17th century chiefly following Native American trading paths, and set up their farms in what they called the &quot;Haw Old Fields,&quot; fertile ground previously tilled by the Sissipahaw. The paths later became the basis of the railroad and interstate highway routes.

Alamance County was named after Great Alamance Creek, site of the Battle of Alamance (May 16, 1771), a pre-Revolutionary War battle in which militia under the command of Governor William Tryon crushed the Regulator movement. Great Alamance Creek, and in turn Little Alamance Creek, according to legend, were named after a local Native American word to describe the blue mud found at the bottom of the creeks. Other legends say the name came from another local Native American word meaning &quot;noisy river,&quot; or for the Alamanni region of Rhineland, Germany, where many of the early settlers came from.

During the American Revolution, several small battles and skirmishes occurred in the area that became Alamance County, several of them during the lead-up to the Battle of Guilford Court House, including Pyle&#x27;s Massacre, the Battle of Lindley&#x27;s Mill, and the Battle of Clapp&#x27;s Mill.

In the 1780s, the Occaneechi Native Americans returned to North Carolina from Virginia, this time settling in what is now Alamance County rather than their first location near Hillsborough. In 2002, the modern Occaneechi tribe bought of their ancestral land in Alamance County and began a Homeland Preservation Project that includes a village reconstructed as it would have been in 1701 and a 1930s farming village.

During the early 19th century, the textile industry grew heavily in the area, so the need for better transportation grew. By the 1840s, several mills were set up along the Haw River and near Great Alamance Creek and other major tributaries of the Haw. Between 1832 and 1880, at least 14 major mills were powered by these rivers and streams. Mills were built by the Trollinger, Holt, Newlin, Swepson, and Rosenthal families, among others. One of them, built in 1832 by Ben Trollinger, is still in operation. It is owned by Copland Industries, sits in the unincorporated community of Carolina and is the oldest continuously operating mill in North Carolina.

One notable textile produced in the area was the &quot;Alamance plaids&quot; or &quot;Glencoe plaids&quot; used in everything from clothing to tablecloths. The Alamance Plaids manufactured by textile pioneer Edwin M. Holt were the first colored cotton goods produced on power looms in the South, and paved the way for the region&#x27;s textile boom. (Holt&#x27;s home is now the Alamance County Historical Society.) But by the late 20th century, most of the plants and mills had gone out of business, including the mills operated by Burlington Industries, a company based in Burlington.
By the 1840s, the textile industry was booming, and the railroad was being built through the area as a convenient link between Raleigh and Greensboro. The county was formed on January 29, 1849 from Orange County.

===Civil War===
In March 1861, Alamance County residents voted overwhelmingly against North Carolina&#x27;s secession from the Union, 1,114 to 254. Two delegates were sent to the State Secession Convention, Thomas Ruffin and Giles Mebane, who both opposed secession, as did most of the delegates sent to the convention. At the time of the convention, around 30% of Alamance County&#x27;s population were slaves (total population around 12,000, including roughly 3,500 slaves and 500 free Black people).

North Carolina was reluctant to join other Southern states in secession until the Battle of Fort Sumter in April 1861. When Lincoln called up troops, Governor John Ellis replied, &quot;I can be no party to this wicked violation of the laws of the country and to this war upon the liberties of a free people. You can get no troops from North Carolina.&quot; After a special legislative session, North Carolina&#x27;s legislature unanimously voted for secession on May 20, 1861.

No battles took place in Alamance County, but it sent its share of soldiers to the front lines. In July 1861, for the first time in American history, soldiers were sent in to combat by rail. The 6th North Carolina was loaded onto railroad cars at Company Shops and transferred to the battlefront at Manassas, Virginia (First Battle of Manassas).

Although the citizens of Alamance County were not directly affected throughout much of the war, in April 1865, they witnessed firsthand their sons and fathers marching through the county just days before the war ended with the surrender at Bennett Place near Durham. At Company Shops, General Joseph E. Johnston stopped to say farewell to his soldiers for the last time. By the end of the war, 236 people from Alamance County had been killed in the course of the war, more than any other war since the county&#x27;s founding.

===Kirk–Holden War===

Some of the Civil War&#x27;s most significant effects were seen after it ended. Alamance County briefly became a center of national attention when in 1870 Wyatt Outlaw, an African-American town commissioner in Graham, was lynched by the Ku Klux Klan. He was president of the Alamance County Union League of America (a progressive reform branch of the Federal Government), helped to establish the Republican party in North Carolina, and advocated establishing a school for African Americans. His offense was that Governor William Holden had appointed him a justice of the peace, and he had accepted the appointment. Outlaw&#x27;s body was found hanging 30 yards from the courthouse, with a note pinned to his chest reading, &quot;Beware! You guilty parties – both white and black.&quot; Outlaw was the central figure in political cooperation between blacks and whites in the county.

On July 8, 1870, Governor Holden declared Caswell County to be in a state of insurrection and sent North Carolina militiamen to Caswell and Alamance Counties, under the command of Union veteran George W. Kirk, beginning the so-called Kirk–Holden war. Kirk&#x27;s troops ultimately arrested 82 men.

The Grand Jury of Alamance County indicted 63 klansmen for felonies and 18 for the murder of Wyatt Outlaw. Soon after the indictments were brought, Democrats in the legislature passed a bill to repeal the law under which the indictments had been secured. The 63 felony charges were dropped. The Democratic Party then used a national program of &quot;Amnesty and Pardon&quot; to proclaim amnesty for all who committed crimes on behalf of a secret society. This was extended to the klansmen of Alamance County. There would be no justice in the case of Wyatt Outlaw.

Holden&#x27;s support for Reconstruction led to his impeachment and removal by the North Carolina Legislature in 1871.

===Dairy industry===
The county was once the state leader in dairy production. Several dairies including Melville Dairy in Burlington were headquartered in the county. With increasing real estate prices and a slump in milk prices, most dairy farms have been sold and many of them developed for real estate purposes.

===World War II and the Cold War===
During World War II, Fairchild Aircraft built airplanes at a plant on the eastern side of Burlington. Among the planes built there was the AT-21 gunner, used to train bomber pilots. Near the Fairchild plant was the Western Electric Burlington works. During the Cold War, the plant built radar equipment and guidance systems for missiles and many other electronics for the government, including the guidance system for the Titan missile. The plant closed in 1992 and sat abandoned until 2005, when it was purchased by a local businessman for manufacturing.

The USS &quot;Alamance&quot;, a &quot;Tolland&quot;-class attack cargo ship, was built during and served in and after World War II.

===21st century===
Alamance County&#x27;s population has grown significantly, with the city of Mebane tripling in size between 1990 and 2020. The county has seen significant business and industry growth, including the additions of the North Carolina Commerce Park and the North Carolina Industrial Center, as well as new retail opportunities near Interstates 85 and 40 on the eastern (Tanger Outlets) and western (University Commons and Alamance Crossing) sides of the county.

Some growth has been attributed to illegal immigration, which has led to ongoing legal issues. In 2012, the Department of Justice found the Alamance County Sheriff&#x27;s Office to use discriminatory policing, however the case was dismissed by U.S. District Court Judge Thomas D. Schroeder, finding that the government failed to demonstrate that the ACSO had engaged in discriminatory policing.

Beginning in 2014, the county has been home to a number of political demonstrations. In October 2020, during a demonstration prior to the 2020 United States presidential election, Alamance County sheriff&#x27;s deputies and Graham police used pepper spray against crowd members. Law enforcement reported that pepper spray had been deployed to disperse the crowd following an assault on an officer who was trying to shut down a generator the march organizers had brought, in violation of a signed agreement.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.48%) is water.

The county is in the Piedmont physiographical region. It has a general rolling terrain with the Cane Creek Mountains rising to over in the south-central part of the county just north of Snow Camp. Bass Mountain, one of the prominent hills in the range, is home to a world-renowned bluegrass music festival every year. Also, isolated monadnocks are in the northern part of the county that rise to near or over above sea level.

The largest river that flows through Alamance County is the Haw, which feeds into Jordan Lake in Chatham County, eventually leading to the Cape Fear River. The county is also home to numerous creeks, streams, and ponds, including Great Alamance Creek, where a portion of the Battle of Alamance was fought. The three large municipal reservoirs are: Lake Cammack, Lake Mackintosh, and Graham-Mebane Lake (formerly Quaker Lake). The southwest end of the county is drained by North Rocky River Prong and Greenbrier Creek, two tributaries of the Rocky River in the Deep River system.

==Government and politics==

Lying between overwhelmingly liberal and Democratic Orange County and Durham County to the east, equally Democratic Guilford County to the west, and heavily conservative and Republican Randolph County to the southwest, Alamance leans Republican, though not as overwhelmingly as many other suburban counties in the Piedmont Triad. The last Democratic nominee for president to carry Alamance County was Jimmy Carter in 1976.

Alamance County is a member of the regional Piedmont Triad Council of Governments. The county is led by the Alamance County Board of Commissioners and the County Manager, who is appointed by the Board of Commissioners. County residents also elect two other county government offices: the Sheriff and Register of Deeds.

Alamance County has provided North Carolina with three of its governors and two U.S. senators: Governor Thomas Holt, Governor and Senator Kerr Scott, Governor Robert W. (Bob) Scott (Kerr Scott&#x27;s son), and Senator B. Everett Jordan.














===County manager===
Alamance County adopted the council-manager form of government in the 1970s, where the day-to-day management of county business is done by an individual hired by the commissioners&#x27; board. Since the establishment of the office, the following persons have served as county managers:

===Sports===

====Professional====
The Burlington Sock Puppets, members of the Appalachian League, a wood-bat collegiate summer league, play their home games at Burlington Athletic Stadium in Fairchild Park.

<text>Lenape mythology is the mythology of the Lenape people, an Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands.

== Creation myth ==
The Lenape believe that, before creation, there was nothing, an empty dark space. However, in this emptiness, there existed a spirit of their creator, Kishelamàkânk. Eventually in that emptiness, he fell asleep. While he slept, he dreamt of the world as we know it today, the Earth with mountains, forests, and animals. He also dreamt up man, and he saw the ceremonies man would perform. Then he woke up from his dream to the same nothingness he was living in before. Kishelamàkânk then started to create the Earth as he had dreamt it.

First, he created helper spirits, the Grandfathers of the North, East, and West, and the Grandmother of the South. Together, they created the Earth just as Kishelamàkânk had dreamt it. One of their final acts was creating a special tree. From the roots of this tree came the first man, and when the tree bent down and kissed the ground, woman sprang from it.

All the animals and humans did their jobs on the Earth, until eventually a problem arose. There was a tooth of a giant bear that could give the owner magical powers, and the humans started to fight over it. Eventually, the wars got so bad that people moved away, and made new tribes and new languages. Kishelamàkânk saw this fighting and decided to send a spirit down, Nanapush, to bring everyone back together. He went on top of a mountain and started the first Sacred Fire, which gave off a smoke that caused all the people of the world to come investigate what it was. When they all came, Nanapush created a pipe with a sumac branch and a soapstone bowl, and the creator gave him Tobacco to smoke with. Nanapush then told the people that whenever they fought with each other, to sit down and smoke tobacco in the pipe, and they would make decisions that were good for everyone.

The same bear tooth later caused a fight between two evil spirits, a giant toad and an evil snake. The toad was in charge of all the waters, and amidst the fighting he ate the tooth and the snake. The snake then proceeded to bite his side, releasing a great flood upon the Earth. Nanapush saw this destruction and began climbing a mountain to avoid the flood, all the while grabbing animals that he saw and sticking them in his sash. At the top of the mountain there was a cedar tree that he started to climb, and as he climbed he broke off limbs of the tree. When he got to the top of the tree, he pulled out his bow, played it and sang a song that made the waters stop. Nanapush then asked which animal he could put the branches and the rest of the animals on top of in the water. The turtle volunteered saying he&#x27;d float and they could all stay on him, and that&#x27;s why they call the land turtle island.

Nanapush then decided the turtle needed to be bigger for everyone to live on, so he asked the animals if one of them would dive down into the water to get some of the old Earth. The beaver tried first, but came up dead and Nanapush had to revive him. The loon tried second, but its attempt ended with the same fate. Lastly, the muskrat tried. He stayed down the longest, and came up dead as well, but he had some Earth on his nose that Nanapush put on the Turtles back. Because of his accomplishment, Nanapush told the muskrat he was blessed and his kind would always thrive in the land.

Nanapush then took out his bow and again sang, and the turtle started to grow. It kept growing, and Nanapush sent out animals to try to get to the edge to see how long it had grown. First, he sent the bear, and the bear returned in two days saying he had reached the end. Next, he sent out the deer, who came back in two weeks saying he had reached the end. Finally, he sent the wolf, and the wolf never returned because the land had gotten so big. The Lenape claim that this is why the wolf howls, that it is really a call for their ancestor to come back home.

==Terminology==
Kishelemukong is the creator god, but not involved in the daily affairs of the Lenape. Instead, he directed the &quot;manitowak&quot;, the life-spirits of all living things, which were created by Kishelemukong. The &quot;manitowak&quot; were venerated in ceremonies, rituals, dreams, visions, games and s (see below), as well as through the interventions of the Metinuwak, who were healers, spiritual and emotional guides, and religious leaders; they could communicate with the &quot;manitowak&quot;.

An &quot;ohta&quot; is a wooden doll carved annually and that were said to have remarkable powers of healing and luck.

A &quot;nianque&quot; is an animal guide, such as in a vision quest.

<doc id="93360" wikidata="Q7404849" url="?curid=93360" title="Salishan oral narratives">
<text>Salishan oral narratives consist of the body of traditional narratives of the speakers of the Salishan languages, who inhabit British Columbia, Canada and in Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon in the United States. Each of the many peoples in these groups have their own stories and each storyteller may interpret them in their own ways, but many of the stories of the Salish peoples are similar and share themes and characters, and share their historical origins in the proto-Salishan culture long ago. The earliest descriptions of the oral traditions of the Salishan peoples were the collections of Nuxalk (Bella Coola) mythology by anthropologist Franz Boas.

==Genres==
Many Salishan peoples distinguish between two basic genres of narrative, one is traditional stories corresponding roughly to what is called myth in English and which takes place in a Myth Age before the arrival of the modern age, in which plants, animals and weather phenomena are anthropomorphized. The other type of stories includes historical accounts and &quot;news&quot; or informational stories. For the Nlaka&#x27;pamux of the Fraser Canyon-Nicola regions in British Columbia, the genre of traditional narrative is called &quot;&quot; whereas the informational narrative is called &quot;spíləẋm&quot;, in Montana Salish (Flathead) the distinction is between &quot;sqʷlú(ṁt)&quot; and &quot;sṁiʔṁíy&quot;, and other Salishan languages have similar pairs. 

One important difference between Salishan oral traditions and Western literature is that Salishan traditional narratives are not considered to be fictive, or to be the result of the creativity of the narrator, rather they are considered to convey real knowledge of the world as passed down from the elders. The storyteller also does not &quot;own&quot; the story, although the best storytellers do give the narratives a personal flavor. Rather the stories are considered to be pre-existing and to contain all the knowledge of the world. Demonstrating the significance of the traditional narratives, elder Joe Cullooyah of the Montana Salish stated that &quot;Everything you need to know about life is in the Coyote stories — if you just listen carefully&quot;, and asked what happened to Coyote of the Coyote narratives, Cullooyah answered &quot;You believe that Christ is coming back some day, right? Well, Coyote is coming back some day, too.&quot; 

==From the mythology of the Kalispel, an Interior Salish people==

*In some stories from the Flathead storyteller Lassaw Redhorn and the Kalispel storyteller Domicie Michell the supreme deity is called Amotken, a kind, elderly man who lives alone in heaven. He created five women from five hairs from his head and asked them what they wanted to be. Each gave him a different answer: wickedness and cruelty, goodness, mother of the Earth, fire, water. Amotken did as they asked and declared that wickedness would rule Earth for a time, but goodness would win in the end.

==From the traditions of the Skwxwumesh, a Coast Salish people==
*In some stories told by Skwxwumesh storyteller Louis Miranda the Basket ogress &quot;qálqaliɫ&quot; was an ugly old woman/ogress that stole children and carried them away in her basket.
*For a more extensive survey of Skwxwu7mesh oral traditions, please see History of the Squamish people#Oral history and History of the Squamish people#Stories.

==From the traditions of the Sts&#x27;Ailes (Chehalis)==
The Sts&#x27;Ailes, who live at Chehalis, British Columbia, have extensive traditions concerning the Sasquatch, whom they regard as another tribe and whom they continue to encounter into modern times. According to Sts&#x27;Ailes stories, the Sasquatch speak the Douglas language, i.e. Stʼatʼimc, the version of St&#x27;at&#x27;imcets spoken at Port Douglas, at the head of Harrison Lake.

<text>Nuu-chah-nulth mythology is the historical oral history of the Nuu-chah-nulth, a group of indigenous peoples living on Vancouver Island in British Columbia.
* Many animals have a spirit associated with them; for example, Chulyen (crow) and Guguyni (raven) are trickster gods.
* Two brothers, Tihtipihin and Kwatyat, were willingly swallowed by a monster because they needed to rescue their mother, who had already been swallowed. The brothers then cut through the stomach and, with their mother, escaped.
* Andaokut was born from the mucus or tears of a woman whose children had been stolen by Malahas (a malicious forest goddess). He rescued the children and killed Malahas.

== Matlose ==
&quot;Matlose&quot; is a famous hobgoblin of the Nootkas; he is a very Caliban of spirits; his head is like the head of something that might have been man but is not; his uncouth bulk is horrid with black bristles, his monstrous teeth and nails are like the claws of a bear. Whoever hears his terrible voice falls like one smitten, and his curved claws rend a prey into morsels with a single stroke.

== Raven annoys octopus ==
One morning, as the tide went out, the old people came to sit and watch the ocean. As they sat there, they saw a woman walking along the beach. Her hair was long and strung into eight braids. Her name was Octopus. There was a digging stick in her hand. She was going to look for clams. She sat down on a rock at the edge of the water and began to dig. Soon, another person came along the beach. That person was tall with glossy black hair. &quot;Look,&quot; one of the old people said, &quot;Here comes Raven. He is going to bother Octopus.&quot; &quot;Ah&quot; another of the old people said. &quot;That is not a good idea. You shouldn&#x27;t bother Octopus!&quot;
Sure enough, just as the old people expected, Raven. walked right down to the rock where Octopus sat and began to bother her.&quot;

<text>Anguta (also called &quot;His Father,&quot; Anigut, or Aguta) is the father of the sea goddess Sedna in the Inuit religion. 

==Status==
In certain myths of the Greenlandic Inuit, Anguta is considered the creator god and is the supreme being among Inuit. In other myths, Anguta is merely a mortal. He is a god of the dead in some myths.

==Name==
His name, meaning &quot;man with something to cut&quot;, refers to his mutilating of his daughter which ultimately resulted in her godhood, an act he carried out in both myths. 

==Function==
Anguta is a psychopomp, ferrying souls from the land of the living to the underworld, called Adlivun, where his daughter rules. Those souls must then sleep near him for a year before they go to Qudlivun (&quot;those above us&quot;), where they will enjoy eternal bliss. In some versions of the myth, only unworthy souls have to stay with Anguta in the land of the dead. In these myths, he pinches the dead to torment them.

<doc id="93371" wikidata="Q243312" url="?curid=93371" title="Kassites">
<text>The Kassites () were a people of the ancient Near East. They controlled Babylonia after the fall of the Old Babylonian Empire from until (short chronology).

The Kassites gained control of Babylonia after the Hittite sack of Babylon in 1531 BC, and established a dynasty generally assumed to have been based first in that city, after a hiatus. Later rule shifted to the new city of Dur-Kurigalzu. By the time of Babylon&#x27;s fall, the Kassites had already been part of the region for a century and a half, acting sometimes with Babylon&#x27;s interests and sometimes against. There are records of Kassite and Babylonian interactions, in the context of military employment, during the reigns of Babylonian kings Samsu-iluna (1686 to 1648 BC), Abī-ešuh, and Ammī-ditāna.

The origin and classification of the Kassite language, like the Sumerian language and Hurrian language, is uncertain, and, also like the two latter languages, has generated a wide array of speculation over the years, even to the point of linking it to Sanskrit, however like these other languages it is regarded as a Language Isolate and is not accepted to be Semitic or Indo-European. The Kassite religion is also poorly understood, though the names of some Kassite deities are known. The chief gods, titular gods of the kings, were Shuqamuna and Shumaliya, which are distinct from Sumerian, Semitic and Indo-European gods. As was typical in the region, there was some cross pollination with other religions. After Babylon came within the Kassite sphere of control its city-god, Marduk, was absorbed into the Kassite pantheon.

==History==
Documentation of the Kassite period depends heavily on the scattered and disarticulated tablets from Nippur, where thousands of tablets and fragments have been excavated. They include administrative and legal texts, letters, seal inscriptions, private votive inscriptions, and even a literary text (usually identified as a fragment of a historical epic). Many of those tablets have not yet been published, including hundreds held in the Ottoman Museum in Istanbul.

About 100 Kassite tablets were found at Dur-Kurigalzu. A few inscribed building materials of Kurigalzu I were found at Kish. Several tablets dated to the reign of Agum III were found at the Dilmun site of Qal&#x27;at al-Bahrain. In total, about 12,000 Kassite period documents have been recovered, of which only around 10% have been published. There are also a number of building inscriptions, all but one written in Sumerian unlike the Akkadian typically used by the Kassites. A number of seals have also been found. Kudurrus, stone stele used to record land grants and related documents, provide another source for Kassite history. This practice continued for several centuries after the end of the Kassite Dynasty. Often situated on the surface, many were found early and made their way to museums around the world.
The ancient city of Nippur was a major focus for the Kassites. Early on, refurbishments were conducted of the various religious and administrative buildings, the first of these datable to Kurigalzu I. Major construction occurred under Kadashman-Enlil, Kudur-Enlil, and Shagarakti-Shuriash, with lesser levels of repair work under Adad-shuma-usur and Meli-Shipak. Other important centers during the Kassite period were Larsa, Sippar and Susa. The Kassites were very active at Ur. At the site of Isin, which had been abandoned after the time of Samsu-iluna, major rebuilding work occurred on the religious district including the temple of Gula. The work at Isin was initiated by Kurigalzu I and continued by Kadashman-Enlil I, and after a lapse, by Adad-shuma-usur and Meli-Shipak II. After the Kassite dynasty was overthrown in 1155 BC, the system of provincial administration continued and the country remained united under the succeeding rule, the Second Dynasty of Isin.

=== Origins ===
The origin of the Kassites is uncertain, though a number of theories have been advanced. Several suspected Kassite names are recorded in economic documents from the Ur III period (c. 2112–2004 BC) in southern Babylon, but their origin is ambiguous. They are thought to originate from the Zagros Mountains. Kassites were first reported in Babylonia in the 18th century BC, especially around the area of Sippar. The 9th year name of king Samsu-iluna (1749–1712 BC) of Babylon, the son of Hammurabi mentions them ie. (&quot;Year in which Samsu-iluna the king (defeated) the totality of the strength of the army / the troops of the Kassites&quot;).

===Middle Bronze Age===
As the Babylonian empire weakened in the following years the Kassites became a part of the landscape, even at times supplying troops for Babylon.
The Hittites had carried off the idol of the god Marduk, but the Kassite rulers regained possession, returned Marduk to Babylon, and made him the equal of the Kassite Shuqamuna. Babylon under Kassite rulers, who renamed the city &quot;Karanduniash&quot;, re-emerged as a political and military power in Mesopotamia.

=== Late Bronze Age ===
The fall of the First Sealand dynasty in 1460 BC created a power vacuum which the Kassites filled. After the destruction of the Mittani by the Hittites in the early 14th century BC Assyria rose in power creating a three way power structure in the region between the Kassites, Hittites, and Assyrians with Elam exerting influence from the east and Egypt from the south. A number of the Amarna Letters are correspondence between the respective rulers (including 14 between the Pharaoh and the Kassite ruler). An International System came into place between these parties connected by widespread trade, treaties, and intermarriage between the ruling classes (especially between the Kassites and Elamites). A typical treaties include the Egyptian–Hittite peace treaty (c.1259 BC) and the treaty between the Kassite ruler Karaindash and the Assyrian ruler Ashur-bel-nisheshu (c. 1410 BC).

At the peak of their power the Kassites, under Kurigalzu I in the mid 14h century BC, conquered Elam and sacked the capital of Susa. That ruler initiated significant building efforts in Ur and other southern Mesopotamia cities. The most notable of these efforts was the construction of a new city, Dur-Kurigalzu. It contained a number of palaces and also temples to many Babylonia gods including Enlil, Ninlil, and Ninurta. The Kassites also extended their power into the Persian Gulf, including at Qal&#x27;at al-Bahrain. Being in close proximity the Assyrians and Kassites often came into political and military conflict over the next few centuries. For a time in the early reign of Tukulti-Ninurta I Assyria gained ascendancy, until the Elamites under Kidin-Hutran III intervened. This period is marked by a building hiatus at Babylon, similar to the one after the fall of the First Babylonian dynasty.

===Iron Age===
The Elamites of the Shutrukid dynasty conquered Babylonia, carrying away the Statue of Marduk, in the 12th century BC, thus ending the Kassite state. According to the Assyrian Synchronistic Chronicle, which is not considered reliable, the last Kassite king, Enlil-nadin-ahi, was taken to Susa and imprisoned there in 1155 BC, where he also died.

The annals of the Assyrian king Sennacherib detail that on his second, eastern, campaign of 702 BC he campaigned against the land of the Kassites, that being along the Diyala River between the Jebel Hamrin and the Darband-i-Khan. The Kassites took refuge in the mountains but were brought down and resettled, in standard Assyrian practice, in Hardispi and Bit Kubatti, which were made part of the Arrapha district.

==Kassite dynasty==

The Babylonian and Assyrian king lists mention eight or nine early Kassite rulers whose names are not fully known and who precede the following kings. Another Kassite king, Hašmar-galšu, is known from five inscriptions from the Nippur area.

Note that the relative order of Kadashman-Turgu and Kadashman-Enlil II have been questioned.

==Kassite language==
The Kassite language has not been classified. The few sources consist of personal names, a few documents, and some technical terms related to horses and chariotry. What is known is that their language was not related to either the Indo-European language group, nor to Semitic or other Afro-Asiatic languages, and is most likely to have been a language isolate, although some linguists have proposed a link to the Hurro-Urartian languages of the Armenian highlands and Northern Mesopotamia.

It has been suggested that several Kassite leaders bore Indo-European names, and they might have had an Indo-European elite similar to the Mitanni. Over the centuries, however, the Kassites were absorbed into the Babylonian population. Eight among the last kings of the Kassite dynasty have Akkadian names. It has also been suggested that the first element in Kudur-Enlil&#x27;s name is derived from Elamite but that is disputed.

==Kassite art==
=== Ceramics ===

The Kassites produced a substantial amount of pottery. It is found in many Mesopotamia cities including Eridu and Tell Khaiber. Archaeologists divide it into three periods, Early Kassite (before c. 1415 BC), Middle Kassite (c. 1415–1225 BC), and Late Kassite (c. 1225–1155 BC). Many small pottery kilns, generally no bigger than 2 meters in diameter with domed tops, were found in the Babylonian city of Dilbat. Goblets and wavy sided bowls are commonly found in Kassite pottery deposits. Other ceramic goods, such as traps for small animals and vessels commonly thought to be fruit stands were found also. Kassite pottery deposits have been found as far away as Al Khor Island in the Persian Gulf area.

=== Glass works ===
Remnants of two Kassite glass beakers were found during the 1964 excavation in a (c. 800 BC) destruction layer of Hasanlu, in northwest Iran. The mosaic glass beakers are thought to have been heirlooms, possibly for ritual use the find spot being a temple. The panes of glass used to create these images were very brightly colored, and closer analysis has revealed that they were bright green, blue, white, and red-orange. A Kassite text found at Dur-Kurigalzu mentions glass given to artisans for palace decoration and similar glass was found there. Other similar glass dated 1500 BC was found at Tell al-Rimah.

=== Seal impressions ===
Seals were used widely across the Near Eastern kingdoms during the Kassite rule. They were used to mark official items and ownership. The images created by these seals were unique to each seal, but many shared the same subject matter. Bearded men, religious symbols, horned quadrupeds, and fauna are often shown in these images. The seals were generally made of stone, glass, or clay. The images were made by stamping or rolling the seals into wet clay.

<text>DASA (officially Deutsche AeroSpace AG, later Daimler-Benz AeroSpace AG, then DaimlerChrysler AeroSpace AG) was a German aerospace manufacturer.

It was created during 1989 as the aerospace subsidiary arm of Daimler-Benz AG (later DaimlerChrysler) from 1989. The company acquired rival manufacturer Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) that same year, integrating it along with its other aerospace interests, MTU München, and Dornier Flugzeugwerke, by 1992.

The company&#x27;s existence was relatively brief due to the peace dividend of the 1990s having motivated industry-wide consolidation. During July 2000, DASA merged with Aérospatiale-Matra of France and Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) of Spain to form EADS, which has since rebranded itself as &quot;Airbus Group&quot;.

==History==

DASA (from &quot;Deutsche Aerospace Aktiengesellschaft&quot;) was founded on 19 May 1989 by the merger of Daimler-Benz&#x27;s aerospace interests, MTU München, and Dornier Flugzeugwerke. During December 1989, Daimler-Benz acquired rival German aerospace consortium Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) and merged it into DASA. During March 1990, Daimler-Benz initiated a major restructuring of the new group, integrating the previously separate companies into five product groups; Aircraft, Space Systems, Defense and Civil Systems/Propulsion. Several companies continued to exist under their own names but, by 1992, most (including MBB and TST) of the former entities had been fully integrated.

During 1992, DASA&#x27;s helicopter portfolio, which had been largely inherited from MBB, was merged with the helicopter division of French manufacturer Aérospatiale to form Eurocopter. The Bo 108, DASA&#x27;s in-development helicopter derived from MBB&#x27;s highly successful Bo 105, was one of the assets transferred to the new company; it was launched as the Eurocopter EC135 during the early 1990s to considerable similar commercial success. By 2014, Eurocopter, which was subsequently rebranded as &quot;Airbus Helicopters&quot;, was a market leader in the field, operating four principal manufacturing plants in Europe (Marignane and La Courneuve in France, and Donauwörth and Kassel in Germany), plus 32 subsidiaries and participants around the world, including those in Brisbane, Australia, Albacete, Spain and Grand Prairie, USA. As of that same year, in excess of 12,000 helicopters built by the company were in service with over 3,000 customers across roughly 150 countries.

During the early 1990s, DASA became involved as a strategic partner of the Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker, the latter reportedly being interested in expanding its footprint in the regional aircraft sector. During 1993, it was announced that DASA purchased a 40 per cent stake in Fokker. However, by 1995, both Fokker and DASA were experiencing considerable financial difficulties, largely as a result of the extremely competitive nature of the regional market during this era. Fokker was forced to reduce production of its Fokker 50 airliner; and embark upon a major restructuring programme, including efforts to renegotiate prices with its suppliers, in what was viewed by aerospace publication Flight International as a last-ditch effort to save the company. During January 1996, DASA&#x27;s board decided to distance the company from the struggling Fokker. At one stage, DASA had agreed to provide a rescue deal for the company, but this had been contingent upon a commitment by the Dutch government.
The poor state of the company&#x27;s finances heavily contributed to DASA&#x27;s decision to depart the regional aircraft market entirely. According, during June 1996, it was announced that DASA had sold the majority of the assets of its former Dornier division to American aviation company Fairchild Aircraft, leading to the creation of &quot;Fairchild Dornier&quot;. Furthermore, that same year, DASA announced that all manufacturing operations for the Dornier 228 would be transferred to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) of India; two years later, activity on the German production line was permanently terminated. These moves were intended to concentrate the company&#x27;s resources on the production of the larger Dornier 328 airliner, as well as to respond to Dornier&#x27;s wider financial difficulties.

On 1 January 1995, the company announced that it had changed its name to &quot;Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG&quot;. As a consequence of the peace dividend of the 1990s following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, industry-wide consolidation increased. Following the merger of parent company Daimler Benz with American car manufacturer Chrysler Corporation during 1998, the company was renamed &quot;DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG&quot; on 7 November 1998. Management and politicians alike remained keen to form partnerships with other European companies in the aerospace and defense sectors. On 10 July 2000, it was announced that DASA (minus MTU) had formally merged with Aérospatiale-Matra of France and Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) of Spain to form the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS). Following the merger, the former DaimlerChrysler Aerospace division initially operated as &quot;EADS Deutschland GmbH&quot;; following the rebranding of EADS as &quot;Airbus Group&quot;, the division was formally rebranded as &quot;Airbus Defence and Space GmbH&quot;.

==Major projects==
Immediately upon its creation, DASA was associated with several ongoing aircraft programmes, including the multinational Eurofighter Typhoon fighter programme, the Panavia Tornado fighter-bomber, along with various other initiatives and partnerships. The company&#x27;s work on the Tornado was largely conducted via Panavia Aircraft GmbH, a tri-national consortium consisting of British Aerospace (previously British Aircraft Corporation), Aeritalia of Italy, and DASA, having inherited MBB&#x27;s involvement. Under this arrangement, DASA manufactured the Tornado&#x27;s central fuselage on behalf of all international customers while the other partners manufactured the rest of the airframe. DASA&#x27;s subsidiary MTU also held a 40 per cent stake in the Tornado&#x27;s engine manufacturer Turbo-Union, a separate multinational company formed to develop and build the RB199 engines for the aircraft. Production of the Tornado was terminated during 1998; the final batch of aircraft being produced was delivered to the Royal Saudi Air Force, who had ordered a total of 96 IDS Tornados. DASA was also responsible for the mid life upgrade (MLU) of the German fleet of Panavia Tornados, similar to the RAF&#x27;s GR4 upgrade.

During the 1990s, the Eurofighter proceeded towards the mass production phase, DASA holding a workshare stake in the programme. The workshare split had originally been agreed at 33/33/21/13 (United Kingdom/Germany/Italy/Spain) based on the number of units being ordered by each contributing nations. However, following order cuts during the peace dividend following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the programme&#x27;s workshare split was renegotiated as 43% for EADS MAS in Germany and Spain; 37.5% for BAE Systems in the UK; and 19.5% for Alenia. On 27 March 1994, the maiden flight of the Eurofighter prototype took place in Bavaria, flown by DASA chief test pilot Peter Weger. Production was divided into three tranches, these being a production/funding distinction without directly implying an incremental increase in capability with each tranche. Tranche3 was later divided into A and B parts. In September 1998, contracts were signed for production of 148 Tranche1 aircraft and procurement of long lead-time items for Tranche2 aircraft. In March 2008, the final aircraft out of Tranche1 was delivered to the German Air Force, with all successive deliveries being at the Tranche2 standard or above.

Owing to its expertise with both German and NATO aircraft, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace provided various upgrade packages for a wide range of aircraft, such as the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and the Boeing E-3 Sentry. During 1993, &quot;MiG Aircraft Support GmbH&quot; was established with DaimlerChrysler Aerospace holding a 50% stake. The company undertook the upgrade of the German Air Force&#x27;s fleet of 24 MiG-29s to NATO standards. These fighters had been inherited from the former East Germany after the reunification of the country in 1991.

<text>Pineville (; locally ) is a suburban town in the southernmost portion of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, United States. Part of the Charlotte metropolitan area, it is situated in the Waxhaws district between Charlotte and Fort Mill.

== History ==
Pineville became known as a mule trading center during the time of the Charlotte &#x27;gold rush&#x27;. At that time &#x27;Pineville&#x27; was called &#x27;Morrow&#x27;s Turnout&#x27;. Located at the intersection of two major Native American trading routes, it had vast meadows in which the animals of trade and transportation could be &#x27;turned-out&#x27; to pasture.

Pineville was incorporated as a town in 1873. The origins of the name Pineville can be traced back to 1852, when the Charlotte &amp; Columbia Railroad came through the Pineville area. The railroad wanted a more modern name, and the large stands of pine trees in the area inspired the new name – Pineville. In the 1890s, Dover Yarn Mills established a cotton mill in Pineville. This mill later became Cone Mills, Inc., which operated in the town until November 1991. The one-block area of old Pineville was a bustling commercial area, with many different shops. Today this area is home to many quaint shops and restaurants.

The growth of Pineville was greatly changed through the initial segment of I-485 opening to traffic. Although the one-mile (1.6 km) stretch connecting interchanges at NC Highway 51 and South Boulevard was designed to divert through traffic around Charlotte via a freeway loop, I-485 incidentally passed through Pineville&#x27;s town limits. In the years to follow, largely undeveloped land adjacent to Pineville&#x27;s two I-485 interchanges, developed into what is now the largest shopping district in North Carolina. With nearly of retail space, Pineville is home to the Carolina Place Mall, at least two power centres and many strip malls, outparcels and free-standing retailers.

It is the birthplace of James K. Polk, the 11th U.S. president. His home is no longer standing, but an original cabin from that time period is kept there, symbolic of the one he was born in. This is now a state historic site. It has two reconstructed log cabins, both from the local area being built circa 1790. They are furnished in period antiques similar to what the Polks would have used. There is a main house, a cookhouse, and a log barn, and tours are available by costumed guides. First Lady of U.S. at the time, Ladybird Johnson, came to Pineville to dedicate the new state site. In addition to the period log houses there is a museum with a short film on the life and times of James Knox Polk along with period clothes and other artifacts of the area and era. A monument was erected in 1904 on the site of the present-day reconstructed cabins. The state of North Carolina moved the monument from its original location in 1964. It was moved to its current location near the visitor center in 1968.

<doc id="93380" wikidata="Q724450" url="?curid=93380" title="World Boxing Council">
<text>The World Boxing Council (WBC) is an international professional boxing organization. It is among the four major organizations which sanction professional boxing bouts, alongside the World Boxing Association (WBA), International Boxing Federation (IBF) and World Boxing Organization (WBO). 

Many historically high-profile bouts have been sanctioned by the organization with various notable fighters having been recognised as WBC world champions. All four organizations recognise the legitimacy of each other and each have interwoven histories dating back several decades.

==History==
The WBC was initially established by 11 countries: the United States, Argentina, United Kingdom, France, Mexico, Tunisia, the Philippines, Panama, USSR, Chile, Peru, Venezuela and Brazil. Representatives met in Mexico City on 14 February 1963, upon invitation of Adolfo López Mateos, then President of Mexico, to form an international organization to unify all commissions of the world to control the expansion of boxing.

The groups that historically had recognized several boxers as champions included the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC), the National Boxing Association (NBA) of the United States, the European Boxing Union (EBU) and the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC); but for the most part, these groups lacked the all-encompassing &#x27;international&#x27; status they claimed.

Today, it has 161 member countries. The current WBC President is Mauricio Sulaimán. Former Presidents include Luis Spota and Ramon G. Velázquez of Mexico, Justiniano N. Montano Jr. of the Philippines and José Sulaimán of Mexico from 1975 until his death in 2014.

In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Council blocked championship fights involving Russian and Belarusian boxers.

===Championship===
The WBC&#x27;s green championship belt portrays the flags of all of the 161 member countries of the organization. All WBC world title belts look identical regardless of weight class; however, there are minor variations on the design for secondary and regionally themed titles within the same weight class.

The WBC has nine regional governing bodies affiliated with it, such as the North American Boxing Federation, the Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation, the European Boxing Union, and the African Boxing Union.

Although rivals, the WBC&#x27;s relationship with other sanctioning bodies has improved over time and there have even been talks of unification with the WBA. Unification bouts between WBC and other organizations&#x27; champions are becoming more common in recent years. Throughout its history, the WBC has allowed some of its organization&#x27;s champions to fight unification fights with champions of other organizations, although there were times it stepped in to prevent such fights. For many years, it also prevented its champions from holding the WBO belt. When a WBO-recognized champion wished to fight for a WBC championship, he had to abandon his WBO title first, without any special considerations. This, however, is no longer the case.

In 1983, following the death of Kim Duk-koo from injuries sustained in a 14-round fight against Ray Mancini, the WBC took the unprecedented step of reducing the distance of its world championship bouts, from 15 rounds to 12—a move other organizations soon followed (for boxers&#x27; safety).

Among those to have been recognized by the WBC as world champions are the undefeated and undisputed champions Terence Crawford, Errol Spence Jr., Joe Calzaghe, Floyd Mayweather Jr., Roy Jones Jr., Wilfred Benítez, Wilfredo Gómez, Julio César Chávez, Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Larry Holmes, Sugar Ray Leonard, Thomas Hearns, Mike Tyson, Salvador Sánchez, Héctor Camacho, Marvin Hagler, Carlos Monzón, Rodrigo Valdez, Roberto Durán, Juan Laporte, Félix Trinidad, Edwin Rosario, Bernard Hopkins, Alexis Argüello, Nigel Benn, Lennox Lewis, Vitali Klitschko, Érik Morales, Miguel Cotto, Manny Pacquiao, Naoya Inoue, Canelo Álvarez, Tony Bellew, Mairis Briedis, and Grigory Drozd.

At its discretion, the WBC may designate and recognize, upon a two-thirds majority vote of its Board of Governors, one or more emeritus world champions in each weight class. Such a recognition is for life and is only bestowed upon present or past WBC world champions. The following boxers have earned the &quot;Emeritus Championship&quot; appellation throughout their careers: Lennox Lewis, Vitali Klitschko, Roy Jones Jr., Bernard Hopkins (Honorary Champion), Mikkel Kessler, Sergio Martínez, Floyd Mayweather Jr., Kostya Tszyu, Manny Pacquiao, Danny García, Érik Morales, Toshiaki Nishioka, Vic Darchinyan, Édgar Sosa and Tony Bellew. This allows the fighters, should they return to competition, to take part in a title bout in the division they have been crowned emeritus champion. During the WBC&#x27;s 51st Convention in Bangkok, Thailand, Floyd Mayweather Jr. was named &quot;Supreme Champion&quot;, a designation that nobody before him has ever achieved.
The WBC bolstered the legitimacy of women&#x27;s boxing by recognizing fighters such as Christy Martin and Lucia Rijker as contenders for female world titles in 16 weight divisions. The first WBC World Female Champion (on 30 May 2005) was the super bantamweight Jackie Nava from Mexico. With her former-champion father at ringside, Laila Ali won the super middleweight title on 11 June 2005.

===Silver Championship===
In 2010, the WBC created a &quot;Silver Championship&quot;, intended as a replacement for interim titles. Justin Savi was the first boxer to win a Silver title after defeating Cyril Thomas on 16 April 2010. Unlike its interim predecessor, a boxer holding the Silver title cannot automatically inherit a full world title vacated by the champion. The WBC continues to recognize interim and Silver Champions, as well as interim Silver Champions. A year later, the WBC introduced Silver versions to its International titles. As of 2020, there are Silver titles of the female world title, Youth World title, USNBC title, Latino title and also FECARBOX title.

===Diamond Championship===
In September 2009, the WBC created its new &quot;Diamond Championship&quot; belt. This belt was created as an honorary championship exclusively to award the winner of a historic fight between two high-profile and elite boxers. The inaugural Diamond belt was awarded on 14 November 2009 to Manny Pacquiao, who won his 7th world title (in seven different divisions) via a 12th-round technical knockout (TKO) over Miguel Cotto at welterweight in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. Other holders of this title have included Mairis Briedis (cruiserweight), Bernard Hopkins (light heavyweight), Callum Smith (super middleweight), Sergio Martínez and Canelo Álvarez (middleweight), Floyd Mayweather Jr. (super welterweight), Errol Spence Jr. (welterweight), Regis Prograis and Josh Taylor (super lightweight), Nonito Donaire (super bantamweight and bantamweight), Naoya Inoue (super bantamweight and bantamweight), Léo Santa Cruz (featherweight), Jean Pascal and Sergey Kovalev (light heavyweight), Mikey Garcia (welterweight and super lightweight), Jorge Linares (lightweight), Alexander Povetkin (heavyweight), and Román González (super flyweight). Female Diamond champions have included Claressa Shields (middleweight), Amanda Serrano (super bantamweight), Ana María Torres (bantamweight), Raja Amasheh (super flyweight), Ava Knight and Jessica Chávez (flyweight). Although this title can be defended, it is not a mandatory requirement. The title can also be vacated in the case of a fighter&#x27;s long-term absence or retirement from boxing.

===Franchise Championship===
In 2019, the WBC Franchise Championship was introduced as an honorary title awarded to dominant champions that have represented the WBC and is a special designation and status which the WBC may honor to a current WBC World Champion, who is also an elite boxer, and who remains a top performer in the sport. Boxers who has been given the honorary title, must vacate their WBC world title in that division as the honorary title is transferable. Boxers who have been named WBC Franchise Champion include: Canelo Alvarez (middleweight; 2019–2020), Vasiliy Lomachenko (lightweight; 2019–2020), Teófimo López (lightweight; 2020–2021), Juan Francisco Estrada (super flyweight; since 2021), and George Kambosos Jr. (lightweight; 2021–2022).

===Eternal Championship===
The WBC Eternal Championship is an honorary title awarded to retired boxers that have never lost the WBC world title in the ring while having a solid number of successful title defenses. Jiselle Salandy was awarded the Eternal title as she defended the WBC female super welterweight title five times before her death on 4 January 2009. On 12 December 2016, Vitali Klitschko was recognized as &quot;Eternal Champion&quot;, as he had 10 successful WBC heavyweight title defenses during his career before his retirement in 2013 and was never knocked down throughout his career either.

===Commemorative World Championship Belts===

In an exclusive interview with &quot;The Telegraph&quot; in 2022, WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman said that the WBC would ban transgender fighters from competing against cisgender fighters &quot;so the dangers of a man fighting a woman will never happen&quot;, and would instead introduce a separate trans category of competition wherein athletes would be divided by their gender assigned at birth. Sulaiman called for current fighters who may be trans to come forward and register accordingly.

==Controversies==
In early 1998, Roy Jones Jr. announced that he was relinquishing his WBC light heavyweight title. In response, the WBC ordered a bout between Graciano Rocchigiani from Germany and the former champion Michael Nunn to fill the vacancy, sanctioning it as a world championship match. On 21 March 1998, Rocchigiani won the fight and a WBC belt; in the subsequent WBC rankings, he was listed as &quot;Light Heavyweight World Champion&quot;.

Jones, however, had a change of heart and asked if the WBC would reinstate him as the champion. In a move that violated nearly a dozen of its own regulations, the WBC granted the reinstatement. Rocchigiani received a letter from the WBC advising that the publication of his name as champion was a typographical error and he had never been the official title holder.

Rocchigiani immediately filed a lawsuit against the WBC in a U.S. federal court, claiming that the organization&#x27;s actions were both contrary to their own rules and injurious to his earning potential (due to diminished professional stature). On 7 May 2003, the judge ruled in Rocchigiani&#x27;s favor, awarding him $31 million (U.S.) in damages and reinstating him as a former WBC champion (Rocchigiani had lost a bout since his WBC title match).

The following day, the WBC sought protection by filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy (i.e., corporate debt restructuring) in Puerto Rico. The organization spent the next 13 months trying to negotiate a 6-figure settlement with Rocchigiani, but the fighter at first rejected the proposal.

On 11 June 2004, the WBC announced it would enter Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation (i.e., business closing and total asset sell-off) proceedings, effectively threatening its existence. This action prompted some in the boxing community to plead with Rocchigiani to settle the dispute, which he did in mid-July 2004. 

===Don King===
Many in the boxing community have accused the WBC of bending its rules to suit the powerful boxing promoter Don King. The journalist Jack Newfield wrote, &quot;...[WBC President José Sulaimán] became more King&#x27;s junior partner than his independent regulator&quot;. Another journalist, Peter Heller, echoes that comment: &quot;Sulaimán...became little more than an errand boy for Don King&quot;. Heller quotes British promoter Mickey Duff as saying, &quot;My complaint is that José Sulaimán is not happy his friend Don King is the biggest promoter in boxing. Sulaimán will only be happy when Don King is the &quot;only&quot; promoter in boxing.&quot;

Newfield and Heller take issue with the following actions of the WBC:
* When Leon Spinks won the WBA and WBC Heavyweight Championships from Muhammad Ali in 1978, the WBC stripped Leon Spinks of his title. José Sulaimán said the WBC did so because Spinks was signed for a rematch with Ali instead of fighting a Don King fighter, Ken Norton. Norton defended the WBC title against another Don King fighter, Larry Holmes, who won the belt.
* In 1983, WBC Super Featherweight Champion Bobby Chacon was signed to fight Cornelius Boza-Edwards, the WBC&#x27;s mandatory challenger for his title. But, the promoter Don King wanted his fighter, Héctor Camacho, to fight for the title. Although WBC rules said the mandatory challenger should receive a shot at the title, the WBC withdrew its sanction from the fight. It stripped Chacon of his title for refusing to fight Camacho.
* Under WBC rules, a fighter is supposed to defend his title against a mandatory challenger at least once a year. For fighters controlled by Don King, this rule is often ignored. For instance, Alexis Argüello and Carlos Zárate were allowed to ignore their obligations as WBC champions to their mandatory contenders.
* When WBC Super Featherweight Champion Julio César Chávez wanted to fight top contender Roger Mayweather for a promoter other than Don King, the WBC withheld its sanction of the fight until Don King became promoter.
* When Mike Tyson lost to James &quot;Buster&quot; Douglas during an IBF, WBC and WBA Heavyweight Championship defense, King convinced the WBC (along with the WBA) to withhold recognition of Douglas as heavyweight champion. King claimed that Tyson had won the fight by knocking Douglas down, after which the referee gave Douglas a &quot;long count&quot;. The referee, Octavio Meyran, claims in an affidavit that King threatened to have the WBC withhold payment of his hotel bill if he did not support King&#x27;s protest. Because of intense public pressure, both the WBA and WBC backed down and recognized Douglas as champion.
* In 1992, the WBC threatened to strip Evander Holyfield of his title for defending it against Riddick Bowe instead of Razor Ruddock. Holyfield obtained a court order to stop the organization. In a taped deposition for the United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Holyfield said that the WBC wanted him to defend his championship against Ruddock because Ruddock was managed by King.
* During the 1990s, the WBC did not allow its champions to engage in unification bouts with WBO champions. However, in 1993, the super middleweight showdown between WBC champion Nigel Benn and WBO champion Chris Eubank, promoted by Don King, was recognized as a title unification fight by the WBC. The bout ended in a draw and each retained their respective titles.
* When Mike Tyson was released from prison in 1995, the WBC installed him as their #1 contender for their heavyweight championship. Tyson had not fought in four years, but was promoted by Don King.
* In 1993, Julio César Chávez, managed and promoted by Don King, received a majority draw against Pernell Whitaker in their WBC welterweight title fight in San Antonio, Texas. Virtually every ringside observer and boxing analyst had Whitaker winning at least 8 or 9 rounds of the 12-round fight and CompuBox statistics showed Whitaker outlanding Chávez by a wide margin. But two of the three judges had the fight scored even. The fight was promoted by King and two of the judges were not appointed by the state&#x27;s boxing commission (in this case, Texas) like any other time; instead, they were appointed by the WBC. It had been reported that Don King had a hand in helping to secure the WBC judges for the fight. To this day, the resulting draw is considered one of the most controversial decisions ever.
* In 2000, Chávez, still promoted by King, was made the mandatory challenger for Kostya Tszyu&#x27;s WBC super lightweight title. Chávez did not appear to satisfy requirements for a mandatory challenger: he had not fought at super lightweight for two years, had recently lost to journeyman boxer Willy Wise and had not beaten a top contender since losing to Oscar De La Hoya for the first time in 1996.
* In 2005, the WBC stripped Javier Castillejo of his super welterweight title for fighting Fernando Vargas instead of Ricardo Mayorga, a fighter promoted by Don King. The WBC qualified Mayorga for a shot at the super welterweight title although he had never fought at that weight limit and had lost two of his last three fights.

==Politics==
Like all of Eastern New Mexico, Union County is heavily Republican. The county has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1948. Hillary Clinton in 2016 received the worst showing for a Democrat in the county&#x27;s history – but this was partially due to a large migration towards third-party candidates such as New Mexico native and former governor Gary Johnson, who ran as a libertarian.

Taos County is heavily Democratic; the last Republican candidate to win the county was Richard Nixon in 1972 by just over 2%. Taos County often rivals Santa Fe County as the most Democratic county in New Mexico. Taos itself, Ranchos de Taos, Taos Pueblo, Taos Ski Valley, Picuris Pueblo, the Arroyo Seco and Arroyo Hondo areas, and the rural southern and western parts of the county all vote strongly Democratic, while the Red River area votes strongly Republican. Questa and El Prado are also Democratic-leaning, though they saw heavy Republican trends in 2024.
