<text>Phreaking is a slang term coined to describe the activity of a culture of people who study, experiment with, or explore telecommunication systems, such as equipment and systems connected to public telephone networks. The term &quot;phreak&quot; is a sensational spelling of the word &quot;freak&quot; with the &quot;ph-&quot; from &quot;phone&quot;, and may also refer to the use of various audio frequencies to manipulate a phone system. &quot;Phreak&quot;, &quot;phreaker&quot;, or &quot;phone phreak&quot; are names used for and by individuals who participate in phreaking.

The term first referred to groups who had reverse engineered the system of tones used to route long-distance calls. By re-creating the signaling tones, phreaks could switch calls from the phone handset while avoiding long-distance calling charges which were common then. These fees could be significant, depending on the time, duration and destination of the call. To ease the creation of the routing tones, electronic tone generators known as blue boxes became a staple of the phreaker community. This community included future Apple Inc. co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.

The blue box era came to an end with the ever-increasing use of digital telephone networks which allowed telecommunication companies to discontinue the use of in-band signaling for call routing purposes. Instead, telecom companies began employing common-channel signaling (CCS), through which dialing information was sent on a separate channel that was inaccessible to the telecom customer. By the 1980s, most of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) in the US and Western Europe had adopted the SS7 system which uses out-of-band signaling for call control (and which is still in use to this day), therefore rendering blue boxes obsolete. Phreaking has since become closely linked with computer hacking.

==History==
Phreaking began in the 1960s when it was discovered that certain whistles could replicate the 2600 Hz pitch used in phone signalling systems in the United States. Phone phreaks experimented with dialing around the telephone network to understand how the phone system worked, engaging in activities such as listening to the pattern of tones to figure out how calls were routed, reading obscure telephone company technical journals (often obtained through dumpster diving), social engineering, building electronic devices called blue boxes, black boxes, and red boxes to help them explore the network and make free phone calls, hanging out on early conference call circuits and &quot;loop arounds&quot; to communicate with one another and writing their own newsletters to spread information. Phreaking was especially prevalent in universities, where it began spreading much like computer hacking would in the following decades.

Before 1984, long-distance telephone calls were a premium item in the United States, with strict regulations. In some locations, calling across the street counted as long distance. To report that a phone call was long-distance meant an elevated importance because the calling party is paying by the minute to speak to the called party.

Some phreaking consists of techniques to evade long-distance charges, which is criminalized as &quot;toll fraud&quot;. In 1990, the pager cloning technique arose and was used by law enforcement.

In the UK the situation was rather different due to the difference in technology between the American and British systems, the main difference being the absence of tone dialing and signaling, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s. Still, US and UK phreaking often reflected a shared culture.

The tone system in the United States has been almost entirely replaced, but in some countries, in addition to new systems, the tone system is still available, for example in Italy.

===Switch hook and tone dialer===
Possibly one of the first phreaking methods was switch-hooking, which allows placing calls from a phone where the rotary dial or keypad has been disabled by a key lock or other means to prevent unauthorized calls from that phone. It is done by rapidly pressing and releasing the switch hook to open and close the subscriber circuit, simulating the pulses generated by the rotary dial. Even most current telephone exchanges support this method, as they need to be backward compatible with old subscriber hardware.

By rapidly clicking the hook for a variable number of times at roughly 5 to 10 clicks per second, separated by intervals of roughly one second, the caller can dial numbers as if they were using the rotary dial. The pulse counter in the exchange counts the pulses or clicks and interprets them in two possible ways. Depending on continent and country, one click with a following interval can be either &quot;one&quot; or &quot;zero&quot; and subsequent clicks before the interval are additively counted. This renders ten consecutive clicks being either &quot;zero&quot; or &quot;nine&quot;, respectively. Some exchanges allow using additional clicks for special controls, but numbers 0-9 now fall in one of these two standards. One special code, &quot;flash&quot;, is a very short single click, possible but hard to simulate. Back in the day of rotary dial, technically identical phone sets were marketed in multiple areas of the world, only with plugs matched by country and the dials being bezeled with the local standard numbers.

Such key-locked telephones, if wired to a modern DTMF capable exchange, can also be exploited by a tone dialer that generates the DTMF tones used by modern keypad units. These signals are now very uniformly standardized worldwide. It is notable that the two methods can be combined: Even if the exchange does not support DTMF, the key lock can be circumvented by switch-hooking, and the tone dialer can be then used to operate automated DTMF controlled services that can not be used with rotary dial.

===2600 hertz===
The origins of phone phreaking trace back at least to AT&amp;T&#x27;s implementation of fully automatic switches. These switches used tone dialing, a form of in-band signaling, and included some tones which were for internal telephone company use. One internal-use tone is a tone of 2600 Hz which causes a telephone switch to think the call had ended, leaving an open carrier line, which can be exploited to provide free long-distance, and international calls. At that time, long-distance calls were more expensive than local calls.

The tone was discovered in approximately 1957, by Joe Engressia, a blind seven-year-old boy. Engressia had perfect pitch, and discovered that whistling the fourth E above middle C (a frequency of 2637.02 Hz) would stop a dialed phone recording. Unaware of what he had done, Engressia called the phone company and asked why the recordings had stopped. Joe Engressia is considered to be the father of phreaking.

Other early phreaks, such as &quot;Bill from New York&quot; (William &quot;Bill&quot; Acker 1953-2015), began to develop a rudimentary understanding of how phone networks worked. Bill discovered that a recorder he owned could also play the tone at 2600 Hz with the same effect. John Draper discovered through his friendship with Engressia that the free whistles given out in Cap&#x27;n Crunch cereal boxes also produced a 2600 Hz tone when blown (providing his nickname, &quot;Captain Crunch&quot;). This allows control of phone systems that work on single frequency (SF) controls. One can sound a long whistle to reset the line, followed by groups of whistles (a short tone for a &quot;1&quot;, two for a &quot;2&quot;, etc.) to dial numbers.

===Multi frequency===
While single-frequency worked on certain phone routes, the most common signaling on the then long-distance network was multi-frequency (MF) controls. The slang term for these tones and their use was &quot;Marty Freeman&quot;. The specific frequencies required were unknown to the general public until 1954, when the Bell System published the information in the &quot;Bell System Technical Journal&quot; in an article describing the methods and frequencies used for inter-office signalling. The journal was intended for the company&#x27;s engineers; however, it found its way to various college campuses across the United States. With this one article, the Bell System accidentally gave away the &quot;keys to the kingdom&quot;, and the intricacies of the phone system were at the disposal of people with a knowledge of electronics.

The second generation of phreaks arose at this time, including New Yorkers &quot;Evan Doorbell&quot;, &quot;Ben Decibel&quot; and Neil R. Bell and Californians Mark Bernay, Chris Bernay, and &quot;Alan from Canada&quot;. Each conducted their own independent exploration and experimentation of the telephone network, initially on an individual basis, and later within groups as they discovered each other in their travels. &quot;Evan Doorbell&quot;, &quot;Ben&quot; and &quot;Neil&quot; formed a group of phreaks, known as &quot;Group Bell&quot;. Bernay initiated a similar group named the &quot;Mark Bernay Society&quot;. Both Bernay and Evan received fame amongst today&#x27;s phone phreakers for internet publications of their collection of telephone exploration recordings. These recordings, conducted in the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s are available at Mark&#x27;s website &quot;Phone Trips&quot;.

===Blue boxes===

In October 1971, phreaking was introduced to the masses when &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine published a story called &quot;Secrets of the Little Blue Box&quot; by Ron Rosenbaum. This article featured Engressia and John Draper prominently, synonymising their names with phreaking. The article also attracted the interest of other soon-to-be phreaks, such as Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, who went on to found Apple Computer.

1971 also saw the beginnings of &quot;YIPL&quot; (&quot;Youth International Party Line&quot;), a publication started by Abbie Hoffman and Al Bell to provide information to Yippies on how to &quot;beat the man&quot;, mostly involving telephones. In the first issue of &quot;YIPL&quot;, writers included a &quot;shout-out&quot; to all of the phreakers who provided technological information for the newsletter: &quot;We at YIPL would like to offer thanks to all you phreaks out there.&quot; In the last issue, YIPL stated:

YIPL believes that education alone cannot affect the System, but education can be an invaluable tool for those willing to use it. Specifically, YIPL will show you why something must be done immediately in regard, of course, to the improper control of the communication in this country by none other than bell telephone company.

In 1973, Al Bell would move YIPL over and start TAP (Technological American Party). 

Al Bell was denied opening a bank account under the name of &quot;Technological American Party&quot;, since he was not a political party, so he changed the name to &quot;Technological Assistance Program&quot; to get a bank account.&lt;ref name=&quot;malicious.life/3/50/YIPL&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

TAP developed into a major source for subversive technical information among phreaks and hackers all over the world. TAP ran from 1973 to 1984, with Al Bell handing over the magazine to &quot;Tom Edison&quot; in the late 1970s. TAP ended publication in 1984 due mostly to a break-in and arson at Tom Edison&#x27;s residence in 1983. Cheshire Catalyst then took over running the magazine for its final (1984) year.

A controversially suppressed article &quot;Regulating the Phone Company In Your Home&quot; in &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine (June 1972) increased interest in phreaking. This article published simple schematic plans of a &quot;black box&quot; used to make free long-distance phone calls, and included a very short parts list that could be used to construct one. AT&amp;T forced &quot;Ramparts&quot; to pull all copies from shelves, but not before numerous copies were sold and many regular subscribers received them.

==Phone hacking==

In the 1980s, the revolution of the personal computer and the popularity of computer bulletin board systems (BBSes) (accessed via modem) created an influx of tech-savvy users. These BBSes became popular for computer hackers and others interested in the technology, and served as a medium for previously scattered independent phone phreaks to share their discoveries and experiments. This not only led to unprecedented collaboration between phone phreaks, but also spread the notion of phreaking to others who took it upon themselves to study, experiment with, or exploit the telephone system. This was also at a time when the telephone company was a popular subject of discussion in the US, as the monopoly of AT&amp;T Corporation was forced into divestiture. During this time, exploration of telephone networks diminished, and phreaking focused more on toll fraud. Computer hackers began to use phreaking methods to find the telephone numbers for modems belonging to businesses, which they could exploit later. Groups then formed around the BBS hacker/phreaking (H/P) community such as the famous Masters of Deception (Phiber Optik) and Legion of Doom (Erik Bloodaxe) groups. In 1985, an underground e-zine called &quot;Phrack&quot; (a combination of the words phreak and hack) began circulation among BBSes, and focused on hacking, phreaking, and other related technological subjects.

In the early 1990s, groups like Masters of Deception and Legion of Doom were shut down by the US Secret Service&#x27;s Operation Sundevil. Phreaking as a subculture saw a brief dispersion in fear of criminal prosecution in the 1990s, before the popularity of the internet initiated a reemergence of phreaking as a subculture in the US and spread phreaking to international levels.
===Toll fraud===
The 1984 AT&amp;T breakup gave rise to many small companies intent on competing in the long-distance market. These included the then-fledgling Sprint and MCI, both of whom had only recently entered the marketplace. At the time, there was no way to switch a phone line to have calls automatically carried by non-AT&amp;T companies. Customers of these small long-distance operations would be required to dial a local access number, enter their calling card number, and finally enter the area code and phone number they wish to call. Because of the relatively lengthy process for customers to complete a call, the companies kept the calling card numbers short – usually 6 or 7 digits. This opened up a huge vulnerability to phone phreaks with a computer.

6-digit calling card numbers only offer 1 million combinations. 7-digit numbers offer just 10 million. If a company had 10,000 customers, a person attempting to &quot;guess&quot; a card number would have a good chance of doing so correctly once every 100 tries for a 6-digit card and once every 1000 tries for a 7-digit card. While this is almost easy enough for people to do manually, computers made the task far easier. &quot;Code hack&quot; programs were developed for computers with modems. The modems would dial the long-distance access number, enter a random calling card number (of the proper number of digits), and attempt to complete a call to a computer bulletin board system (BBS). If the computer connected successfully to the BBS, it proved that it had found a working card number, and it saved that number to disk. If it did not connect to the BBS in a specified amount of time (usually 30 or 60 seconds), it would hang up and try a different code. Using this method, code hacking programs would turn up hundreds (or in some cases thousands) of working calling card numbers per day. These would subsequently be shared amongst fellow phreakers.

There was no way for these small phone companies to identify the culprits of these hacks. They had no access to local phone company records of calls into their access numbers, and even if they had access, obtaining such records would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. While there was some advancement in tracking down these code hackers in the early 1990s, the problem did not completely disappear until most long-distance companies were able to offer standard 1+ dialing without the use of an access number.

===Diverters===

Another method of obtaining free phone calls involves the use of &quot;diverters&quot;. Call forwarding was not an available feature for many business phone lines in the late 1980s and early 1990s, so they were forced to buy equipment that could do the job manually between two phone lines. When the business would close, they would program the call diverting equipment to answer all calls, pick up another phone line, call their answering service, and bridge the two lines together. This gave the appearance to the caller that they were directly forwarded to the company&#x27;s answering service. The switching equipment would typically reset the line after the call had hung up and timed out back to dial tone, so the caller could simply wait after the answering service had disconnected, and would eventually get a usable dial tone from the second line. Phreakers recognized the opportunity this provided, and they would spend hours manually dialing businesses after hours, attempting to identify faulty diverters. Once a phreaker had access to one of these lines, they could use it for one of many purposes. In addition to completing phone calls anywhere in the world at the businesses&#x27; expense, they could also dial 1-900 phone sex/entertainment numbers, as well as use the line to harass their enemies without fear of being traced. Victimized small businesses were usually required to foot the bill for the long-distance calls, as it was their own private equipment (not phone company security flaws) that allowed such fraud to occur. By 1993, call forwarding was offered to nearly every business line subscriber, making these diverters obsolete. As a result, hackers stopped searching for the few remaining ones, and this method of toll fraud died. Many (different type) of diverters still exist and are actively &quot;phreaked&quot; in the United States as of 2020. It is rare to find a diverter solely used for Answering Service forwarding anymore, but the many other types such as phone-company test numbers and remote PBX DISAs are still used as diverters.

===Voice mail boxes and bridges===
Before the BBS era of the 1980s phone phreaking was more of a solitary venture as it was difficult for phreaks to connect with one another. In addition to communicating over BBSs phone phreaks discover voice mail boxes and party lines as ways to network and keep in touch over the telephone. They usually appropriate unused boxes that are part of business or cellular phone systems. Once a vulnerable mailbox system is discovered, word would spread around the phreak community, and scores of them would take residence on the system. They use these systems as a &quot;home base&quot; for communication with one another until the rightful owners discover the intrusion and wipe them off. Voice mailboxes also provide a safe phone number for phreaks to give out to one another as home phone numbers and personal cellular numbers would allow the phreak&#x27;s identity (and home address) to be discovered. This is especially important given that phone phreaks are breaking the law.

Phreakers also use &quot;bridges&quot; to communicate live with one another. The term &quot;bridge&quot; originally referred to a group of telephone company test lines that were bridged together giving the effect of a party-line. Eventually, all party-lines, whether bridges or not, came to be known as bridges if primarily populated by hackers and/or phreakers.

The popularity of the Internet in the mid-1990s, along with the better awareness of voice mail by business and cell phone owners, made the practice of stealing voice mailboxes less popular. To this day bridges are still very popular with phreakers yet, with the advent of VoIP, the use of telephone company-owned bridges has decreased slightly in favor of phreaker-owned conferences.

===End of multi-frequency in the United States===
The end of multi-frequency (MF) phreaking in the lower 48 United States occurred on June 15, 2006, when the last exchange in the contiguous United States to use a &quot;phreakable&quot; MF-signalled trunk replaced the aging (yet still well kept) N2 carrier with a T1 carrier. This exchange, located in Wawina Township, Minnesota, was run by the Northern Telephone Company of Minnesota.

===From 2010 to present===
Recent notable instances of phreaking involve hacking of VOIP systems. In 2011, the government of the Philippines and the FBI arrested four hackers for phone phreaking through PBX hacking. In 2015, Pakistani officials arrested a prominent phreaker who had amassed more than $50 million from PBX hacking activities.

<text>The Motorola DSP56000 (also known as 56K) is a family of digital signal processor (DSP) chips produced by Motorola Semiconductor (later Freescale Semiconductor then NXP) starting in 1986 with later models are still being produced in the 2020s. The 56k series was intended mainly for embedded systems doing signal processing, but was also quite popular for a time in a number of computers, including the NeXT, Atari Falcon030 and SGI Indigo workstations all using the 56001. Upgraded 56k versions are still used in audio equipment, radar systems, communications devices (like mobile phones) and various other embedded DSP applications. The 56000 was also used as the basis for the updated 96000, which was not commercially successful.

== Technical description ==

The DSP56000 uses fixed-point arithmetic, with 24-bit program words and 24-bit data words. It includes two 24-bit registers, which can also be referred to as a single 48-bit register. It also includes two 56-bit accumulators, each with an 8-bit &quot;extension&quot; ( headroom); otherwise, the accumulators are similar to the other 24/48-bit registers. Being a Modified Harvard architecture processor, the 56k has three memory spaces+buses (and on-chip memory banks in some of the models): a program memory space/bus and two data memory space/bus. The stack area is allocated in a separate address space, which is called &quot;Stack Memory Space&quot;, distinct from the main memory address space. The stack, which is used when subroutine calls and &quot;long interrupt&quot;s, is fifteen in depth.

24 bits was selected as the basic word length because it gave the system a reasonable number range and precision for processing audio (sound), the 56000&#x27;s main concern. 24 bits correspond to a dynamic range of 144 dB, sufficient in the 1980s when analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs) rarely exceeded 20 bits. One example is ADSL applications, where filters typically require 20 bits of accuracy. The leftmost four bits are typically considered ample headroom to avoid overflow in calculations.

The processor is capable of carrying out 16.5 million instructions per second (MIPS) at the maximum specified clock speed of 33 MHz, and has hardware support for block-floating point FFT. It uses 5 V TTL levels and consumes approximately 0.4 W.

== Applications and variants ==
In most designs the 56000 is dedicated to one single task, because digital signal processing using special hardware is mostly real-time and does not allow any interruption. For less demanding tasks which are not time-critical, designers normally use a separate CPU or MCU.

The 56000 can execute a 1024-point complex Fast Fourier transform (FFT) in 59,898 clock cycles, taking 1.8 ms at 33 MHz, or a rate of just over 555 operations per second, allowing both realtime decoding and encoding of reasonably advanced audio codecs such as MP3 for direct-to-disc recording purposes.

The addition of SIMD instructions to most desktop computer CPUs have meant that dedicated DSP chips like the 56000 have partly disappeared from some application fields, but they continue to be used widely in communications and other professional uses. To this end the 56800 series added a complete MCU which created a single-chip &quot;DSPcontroller&quot; solution, while the opposite occurred in the 68456, a 68000 with a 56000 on it.

A still quite prevalent model of the 56000 is the third generation 56300 family, starting with the 56301, which features several models with special applications hard- and firmware built-in, like PCI interface logic, CRC processors, or audio companders. Core clock frequencies ranged up to 250 MHz.

The 56000 provides a comprehensive suite of development tool, including a C Compiler, an Assembler, and an Instruction set simulator.

<doc id="89977" wikidata="Q896643" url="?curid=89977" title="Brachydactyly">
<text>Brachydactyly () is a medical term denoting the presence of abnormally short digits (fingers or toes) at birth. The shortness is relative to the length of other long bones and other parts of the body. Brachydactyly is an inherited, dominant trait. It most often occurs as an isolated dysmelia, but can also occur with other anomalies as part of many congenital syndromes. Brachydactyly may also be a signal that one is at risk for congenital heart disease due to the association between congenital heart disease and Carpenter syndrome and the link between Carpenter syndrome and brachydactyly.

Nomograms for normal values of finger length as a ratio to other body measurements have been published. In clinical genetics, the most commonly used index of digit length is the dimensionless ratio of the length of the third (middle) finger to the hand length. Both are expressed in the same units (centimeters, for example) and are measured in an open hand from the fingertip to the principal creases where the finger joins the palm and where the palm joins the wrist.

== Causes ==
Generally, brachydactyly is inherited through an autosomal dominant trait (The exact gene may differ see &quot;Types&quot; table for specific genes). However exceptions could exist due to antiepileptic medicines taken during pregnancy or low blood flow to the extremities during infancy.

== Symptoms ==
Symptoms of isolated brachydactyly include shorter bones in the hands and feet. This could include, phalanges, metacarpals, metatarsals, carpals, and tarsals. Different types of isolated brachydactyly have different symptoms and they are grouped according to what areas they affect.

== Prognosis ==
Isolated brachydactyly does not affect the wellbeing nor longevity of one&#x27;s life, in most cases treatment is not necessary. The trait is primarily a cosmetic one and does not, in most cases, affect function of the hands and feet. Even left untreated and affecting function the general diagnosis of brachydactyly does not impact life expectancy. Prognosis may differ with different types or syndromes. ie. brachydactyly-mesomelia-intellectual disability-heart defects syndrome or if brachydactyly is not isolated and is a part of a larger genetic condition. In rare cases of isolated untreated brachydactyly, simple functions like walking or grabbing objects may be difficult, reducing the overall quality of life.

== Treatment ==
Treatment is needed only if brachydactyly affects the function of the phalanges. In rare cases where function is affected, reconstructive surgery is used to improve function and the ability to use one&#x27;s phalanges. Another treatment includes cosmetic surgery (which is often confused with reconstructive surgery but differs in that cosmetic surgery may not be seen as medically necessary while reconstructive is) to change the way the affected areas appear.

== Diagnosis ==
Brachydactyly is usually diagnosed through anthropometric, clinical, or radiological methods. It is usually found early during infancy or in childhood years when the size difference becomes noticeable. It normally gets diagnosed as the difference in phalange size becomes more apparent. Healthcare providers complete a medical history, physical exam of symptoms and use radiographs (X-rays). The X-rays show whether certain bones are shorter than others or shorter than they are expected to be. Along with these diagnostic steps, the healthcare provider may conduct a genetic test. This could be to see if the disorder runs in the family and has been passed down or to identify the defective gene.

== Epidemiology ==
Most isolated forms of brachydactyly are considered rare, that is, diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 people. However, type A3 and type D are relatively common, affecting around 2% of the population. Particularly high prevalence of brachydactyly type D was reported among Israeli Arabs and in the Japanese population. Type A3 was found at an especially high frequency of 21% among Japanese schoolchildren.

==Types==
There are several types of brachydactyly:
== Other syndromes ==
In the above brachydactyly syndromes, short digits are the most prominent of the anomalies, but in many other syndromes (Down syndrome, Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome, etc.), brachydactyly is a minor feature compared to the other anomalies or problems comprising the syndrome.

<text>The acouchis (genus Myoprocta) are rodents belonging to the family Dasyproctidae from the Amazon basin. They are generally smaller than agoutis and have very short tails (5 to 7 cm), while agoutis lack tails. For this reason the acouchis are also called tailed agoutis.

The two species – the red acouchi (&quot;M. acouchy&quot;) in the Guianas of Amazonia and nearby parts of Brazil, and the green acouchi (&quot;M. pratti&quot;) in western Amazonia - differ in coloration and other characteristics. The taxonomy of the genus has historically been confused, with some authors applying the name &quot;M. acouchy&quot; to the green acouchi, in which case the red acouchi is called &quot;M. exilis&quot;. Although this issue has now been resolved, other problems remain; in particular, the green acouchi may include more than one species.

They are coloured brown or greenish, but with bright orange or red parts on their heads. Often, acouchis live in riverbanks, where they dig holes. Like the common agoutis, but unlike the much larger pacas, acouchis are active at day and feed on fruit.

Acouchis depend on their tails to convey their willingness and readiness to mate. Confident, ready males will hold their tails erect and begin to wag them, whereas the more timid, but still aroused, males will wag their tails in a downward position. Females will signal their interest by erecting their tails while simultaneously arching their backs downward. The litter size is generally two.

<text>A religious denomination is a subgroup within a religion that operates under a common name and tradition, among other activities.
The term refers to the various Christian denominations (for example, Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, and the many varieties of Protestantism). It is also used to describe the five major branches of Judaism (Karaite Judaism, Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist). Within Islam, it can refer to the branches or sects (such as Sunni and Shia), as well as their various subdivisions, such as sub-sects, schools of jurisprudence, schools of theology and religious movements.

The world&#x27;s largest religious denomination is Sunni Islam.

== Christianity ==

A Christian denomination is a generic term for a distinct religious body identified by traits such as a common name, structure, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by doctrine and church authority; issues such as the biblical interpretation, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy often separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices and historical ties are known as branches of Christianity.

== Hinduism ==

In Hinduism, the major deity or philosophical belief identifies a denomination, which also typically has distinct cultural and religious practices. The major denominations include Shaivism, Shaktism, Vaishnavism and Smartism.

==Islam==

Historically, Islam was divided into three major sects, well known as Sunni, Khawarij and Shi‘ah. Nowadays, Sunnis constitute about 90% of the overall Muslim population; the Shi&#x27;ahs are around 10%, while Ibadis, from the Kharijites, have diminished to a level below 0.15%.

Today, many of the Shia sects are extinct. The major surviving Imamah-Muslim Sects are Usulism &quot;(with nearly more than 8.5%),&quot; Nizari Ismailism &quot;(with nearly more than 1%),&quot; Alevism &quot;(with slightly more than 0.5% but less than 1%).&quot; The other existing groups include Zaydi Shi&#x27;a of Yemen whose population is nearly more than 0.5% of the world&#x27;s Muslim population, Musta’li Ismaili (&quot;with nearly 0.1% whose Taiyabi adherents reside in Gujarat state in India and Karachi city in Pakistan. There are also significant diaspora populations in Europe, North America, the Far East and East Africa).&quot;

On the other hand, new Muslim sects like African American Muslims, Ahmadi Muslims &quot;(with nearly around 1%),&quot; non-denominational Muslims, Quranist Muslims, and Wahhabis &quot;(with nearly around 0.5% of the world&#x27;s total Muslim population)&quot; were later independently developed.

A survey by the Pew Research Center suggests that up to 25% of Muslims globally self-identify as non-denominational Muslims.

==Judaism==
Jewish religious movements, sometimes called &quot;denominations&quot; or &quot;branches&quot;, include different groups which have developed among Jews from ancient times. Today, the main division is between the Orthodox, Reform and Conservative lines, with several smaller movements alongside them. This threefold denominational structure is mainly present in the United States, while in Israel the fault lines are between the religious Orthodox and the non-religious.

The movements differ in their views on various issues. These issues include the level of observance, the methodology for interpreting and understanding Jewish law, biblical authorship, textual criticism and the nature or role of the messiah (or messianic age). Across these movements there are marked differences in liturgy, especially in the language in which services are conducted, with the more traditional movements emphasizing Hebrew. The sharpest theological division occurs between Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews who adhere to other denominations, such that the non-Orthodox movements are sometimes referred to collectively as the &quot;liberal denominations&quot; or &quot;progressive streams.&quot;

==Multi-denominational==
The term &quot;multi-denominational&quot; may describe (for example) a religious event that includes several religious denominations from sometimes unrelated religious groups. Many civic events include religious portions led by representatives from several religious denominations to be as inclusive or representational as possible of the expected population or audience. For example: the Sunday thanksgiving mass at Campamento Esperanza (English: Camp Hope) in Chile, where services were led by both a Roman Catholic priest and by an Evangelical preacher during the Chilean 2010 Copiapó mining accident.

Chaplains - frequently ordained clergy of any religion - are often assigned to secular organizations to provide spiritual support to its members who may belong to any of many different religions or denominations. Many of these chaplains, particularly those serving with the military or other large secular organizations, are specifically trained to minister to members of many different faiths, even faiths with opposing religious ideology from that of the chaplain&#x27;s own faith.

Military organizations that do not have large numbers of members from several individual smaller but related denominations will routinely hold multi-denominational religious services, often generically called &quot;Protestant&quot; Sunday services, so minority Protestant denominations are not left out or unserved.

Multi-denominational may also refer to a person&#x27;s faith, in that their belief or affiliation crosses over formal boundaries that strict adherents would not consider. For instance, someone may have been raised Protestant but find Buddhist or Hindu scripture or practice to be helpful without fully abandoning their affiliation with Christianity and therefore may not consider themselves fully Hindu or Buddhist, nor do they consider themselves fully Christian as much as strict adherents. This would not be the same as pantheism as they may not feel any affiliation to say islam. They may class themselves as Christian-Buddhist or Advaita-Christian or just simply spiritual but not religious. They may pray but not meditate or vice versa or both and they may benefit from a wide range of scripture and they may attend both Church and temple.

<doc id="89988" wikidata="Q158060" url="?curid=89988" title="W. E. B. Du Bois">
<text>William Edward Burghardt Du Bois ( ; February 23, 1868 – August 27, 1963) was an American sociologist, socialist, historian, and Pan-Africanist civil rights activist.

Born in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, Du Bois grew up in a relatively tolerant and integrated community. After completing graduate work at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin and Harvard University, where he was its first African American to earn a doctorate, Du Bois rose to national prominence as a leader of the Niagara Movement, a group of black civil rights activists seeking equal rights. Du Bois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta Compromise. Instead, Du Bois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation, which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite. He referred to this group as the talented tenth, a concept under the umbrella of racial uplift, and believed that African Americans needed the chances for advanced education to develop its leadership.

Du Bois was one of the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909. Du Bois used his position in the NAACP to respond to racist incidents. After the First World War, he attended the Pan-African Congresses, embraced socialism and became a professor at Atlanta University. Once the Second World War had ended, he engaged in peace activism and was targeted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He spent the last years of his life in Ghana and died in Accra on August 27, 1963.

Du Bois was a prolific author. Du Bois primarily targeted racism with his writing, which protested strongly against lynching, Jim Crow laws, and racial discrimination in important social institutions. His cause included people of color everywhere, particularly Africans and Asians in colonies. He was a proponent of Pan-Africanism and helped organize several meetings of the Pan-African Congress to fight for the independence of African colonies from European powers. Du Bois made several trips to Europe, Africa and Asia. His collection of essays, &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot;, is a seminal work in African-American literature; and his 1935 magnum opus, &quot;Black Reconstruction in America&quot;, challenged the prevailing orthodoxy that blacks were responsible for the failures of the Reconstruction era. Borrowing a phrase from Frederick Douglass, he popularized the use of the term color line to represent the injustice of the separate but equal doctrine prevalent in American social and political life. His 1940 autobiography &quot;Dusk of Dawn&quot; is regarded in part as one of the first scientific treatises in the field of American sociology. In his role as editor of the NAACP&#x27;s journal &quot;The Crisis&quot;, he published many influential pieces. Du Bois believed that capitalism was a primary cause of racism and was sympathetic to socialist causes.

==Early life==
===Family and childhood===
Du Bois was born on February 23, 1868, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, to Alfred and Mary Silvina Burghardt Du Bois. Mary Silvina Burghardt&#x27;s family was part of the very small free black population of Great Barrington and had long owned land in the state. She was descended from Dutch, African, and English ancestors. William Du Bois&#x27;s maternal great-great-grandfather was Tom Burghardt, a slave (born in West Africa around 1730) who was held by the Dutch colonist Conraed Burghardt. Tom briefly served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, which may have been how he gained his freedom during the late 18th century. His son Jack Burghardt was the father of Othello Burghardt, who in turn was the father of Mary Silvina Burghardt.

William Du Bois claimed Elizabeth Freeman as his relative; he wrote that she had married his great-grandfather Jack Burghardt. But Freeman was 20 years older than Burghardt, and no record of such a marriage has been found. It may have been Freeman&#x27;s daughter, Betsy Humphrey, who married Burghardt after her first husband, Jonah Humphrey, left the area &quot;around 1811&quot;, and after Burghardt&#x27;s first wife died ( 1810). If so, Freeman would have been William Du Bois&#x27;s step-great-great-grandmother. Anecdotal evidence supports Humphrey&#x27;s marrying Burghardt; a close relationship of some form is likely.

William Du Bois&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather was James Du Bois of Poughkeepsie, New York, an ethnic French-American of Huguenot origin who fathered several children with enslaved women. One of James&#x27; mixed-race sons was Alexander, who was born on Long Cay in the Bahamas in 1803; in 1810, he immigrated to the United States with his father. Alexander Du Bois traveled and worked in Haiti, where he fathered a son, Alfred, with a mistress. Alexander returned to Connecticut, leaving Alfred in Haiti with his mother.

Sometime before 1860, Alfred Du Bois immigrated to the United States, settling in Massachusetts. He married Mary Silvina Burghardt on February 5, 1867, in Housatonic, a village in Great Barrington. Alfred left Mary in 1870, two years after their son William was born. Mary Du Bois moved with her son back to her parents&#x27; house in Great Barrington, and they lived there until he was five. She worked to support her family (receiving some assistance from her brother and neighbors), until she suffered a stroke in the early 1880s. She died in 1885.

Great Barrington had a majority European American community, who generally treated Du Bois well. He attended the local integrated public school and played with white schoolmates. As an adult, he wrote about racism that he felt as a fatherless child and being a minority in the town. But teachers recognized his ability and encouraged his intellectual pursuits, and his rewarding experience with academic studies led him to believe that he could use his knowledge to empower African Americans. In 1884, he graduated from Great Barrington High School with honors. When he decided to attend college, the congregation of his childhood church, the First Congregational Church of Great Barrington, raised the money for his tuition.

===University education===
Relying on this money donated by neighbors, Du Bois attended Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1885 to 1888. Like other Fisk students who relied on summer and intermittent teaching to support their university studies, Du Bois taught school during the summer of 1886 after his sophomore year. His travel to and residency in the South was Du Bois&#x27;s first experience with Southern racism, which at the time encompassed Jim Crow laws, bigotry, suppression of black voting, and lynchings; the lattermost reached a peak in the next decade.

After receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Fisk, he attended Harvard College (which did not accept course credits from Fisk) from 1888 to 1890, where he was strongly influenced by professor William James, prominent in American philosophy. Du Bois paid his way through three years at Harvard with money from summer jobs, an inheritance, scholarships, and loans from friends. In 1890, Harvard awarded Du Bois his second bachelor&#x27;s degree, &quot;cum laude&quot;, in history. In 1891, Du Bois received a scholarship to attend the sociology graduate school at Harvard.

In 1892, Du Bois received a fellowship from the John F. Slater Fund for the Education of Freedmen to attend Friedrich Wilhelm University for graduate work. While a student in Berlin, he traveled extensively throughout Europe. He intellectually came of age in the German capital while studying with some of that nation&#x27;s most prominent social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller, Adolph Wagner, and Heinrich von Treitschke. He also met Max Weber who was highly impressed with Du Bois and later cited Du Bois as a counter-example to racists alleging the inferiority of Blacks. Weber met Du Bois again in 1904 on a visit to the US just ahead of the publication of the seminal &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;.

He wrote about his time in Germany: &quot;I found myself on the outside of the American world, looking in. With me were white folkstudents, acquaintances, teacherswho viewed the scene with me. They did not always pause to regard me as a curiosity, or something sub-human; I was just a man of the somewhat privileged student rank, with whom they were glad to meet and talk over the world; particularly, the part of the world whence I came.&quot; After returning from Europe, Du Bois completed his graduate studies; in 1895, he was the first African American to earn a Ph.D. from Harvard University.

===Wilberforce===
In the summer of 1894, Du Bois received several job offers, including from Tuskegee Institute; he accepted a teaching job at Wilberforce University in Ohio. At Wilberforce, Du Bois was strongly influenced by Alexander Crummell, who believed that ideas and morals are necessary tools to effect social change. While at Wilberforce, Du Bois married Nina Gomer, one of his students, on May 12, 1896.

===Philadelphia===
After two years at Wilberforce, Du Bois accepted a one-year research job from the University of Pennsylvania as an &quot;assistant in sociology&quot; in the summer of 1896. He performed sociological field research in Philadelphia&#x27;s African-American neighborhoods, which formed the foundation for his landmark study, &quot;The Philadelphia Negro&quot;, published in 1899 while he was teaching at Atlanta University. It was the first case study of a black community in the United States. Among his Philadelphia consultants on the project was William Henry Dorsey, an artist who collected documents, paintings and artifact pertaining to Black history. Dorsey compiled hundreds of scrapbooks on the lives of Black people during the 19th century and built a collection that he laid out in his home in Philadelphia. Du Bois used the scrapbooks in his research.

By the 1890s, Philadelphia&#x27;s black neighborhoods had a negative reputation in terms of crime, poverty, and mortality. Du Bois&#x27;s book undermined the stereotypes with empirical evidence and shaped his approach to segregation and its negative impact on black lives and reputations. The results led him to realize that racial integration was the key to democratic equality in American cities. The methodology employed in &quot;The Philadelphia Negro&quot;, namely the description and the mapping of social characteristics onto neighborhood areas was a forerunner to the studies under the Chicago School of Sociology.

While taking part in the American Negro Academy (ANA) in 1897, Du Bois presented a paper in which he rejected Frederick Douglass&#x27;s plea for black Americans to integrate into white society. He wrote: &quot;we are Negroes, members of a vast historic race that from the very dawn of creation has slept, but half awakening in the dark forests of its African fatherland&quot;. In the August 1897 issue of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, Du Bois published &quot;Strivings of the Negro People&quot;, his first work aimed at the general public, in which he enlarged upon his thesis that African Americans should embrace their African heritage while contributing to American society.

==Atlanta University==
In July 1897, Du Bois left Philadelphia and took a professorship in history and economics at the historically black Atlanta University in Georgia. His first major academic work was his book &quot;The Philadelphia Negro&quot; (1899), a detailed and comprehensive sociological study of the African-American people of Philadelphia, based on his fieldwork in 1896–1897. This breakthrough in scholarship was the first scientific study of African Americans and a major contribution to early scientific sociology in the U.S.

Du Bois coined the phrase &quot;the submerged tenth&quot; to describe the black underclass in the study. Later in 1903, he popularized the term, the &quot;talented tenth&quot;, applied to society&#x27;s elite class. His terminology reflected his opinion that the elite of a nation, both black and white, were critical to achievements in culture and progress. During this period he wrote dismissively of the underclass, describing them as &quot;lazy&quot; or &quot;unreliable&quot;, but – in contrast to other scholars – he attributed many of their societal problems to the ravages of slavery.

Du Bois&#x27;s output at Atlanta University was prodigious, in spite of a limited budget: he produced numerous social science papers and annually hosted the Atlanta Conference of Negro Problems. He also received grants from the U.S. government to prepare reports about African-American workforce and culture. His students considered him to be a teacher that was brilliant, but aloof and strict.

===First Pan-African Conference===
Du Bois attended the First Pan-African Conference, held in London on July 23–25, 1900.The Conference had been organized by people from the Caribbean: Haitians Anténor Firmin and Benito Sylvain and Trinidadian barrister Henry Sylvester Williams. Du Bois closed the conference by delivering a speech entitled &quot;To the Nations of the World&quot;, in which he asked European leaders to ensure equal opportunity for all races, allow their colonies the right to self-government, and to recognise the political and human rights of African Americans. This came amidst a period in which southern states were passing legislation to effectively prevent African Americans from voting, an exclusion from the political system that lasted until the 1960s.

At the conclusion of the conference, delegates unanimously adopted &quot;To the Nations of the World&quot;, and sent copies of the speech to heads of state who governed large populations of African descent that suffered oppression. The text appealed for &quot;[acknowledgment] and [protection of] the rights of people of African descent&quot; from the United States and imperial European nations, and the recognition of &quot;the free Negro States of Abyssinia, Liberia, Haiti, etc.&quot; It was signed by Bishop Alexander Walters (President of the Pan-African Association), Rev. Henry B. Brown (vice-president), Henry Sylvester Williams (General Secretary) and Du Bois (chairman of the committee on the Address). Du Bois included the statement &quot;the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the colour-line&quot; in the speech, a phrase that he would use again in the introduction of the book &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot;.

===1900 Paris Exposition===

Du Bois was the primary organizer of &quot;The Exhibit of American Negroes&quot; at the 1900 Paris Exposition, held between April and November 1900, for which he compiled a series of 363 photographs aiming to commemorate the lives of African Americans at the turn of the century and challenge the racist caricatures and stereotypes of the day. Du Bois aimed to display changes to the living conditions of African Americans during the 18th and 19th centuries, while also demonstrating the advancement of education and literature within the community. Included were charts, graphs, and maps, which displayed economic, demographic, and sociological data relating to the contemporary and historic living conditions of African Americans, as well as their scientific and cultural achievements. He was awarded a gold medal for his role as compiler of the materials, which are housed at the Library of Congress.

===Booker T. Washington and the Atlanta Compromise===
In the first decade of the new century, Du Bois emerged as a spokesperson for his race, second only to Booker T. Washington. Washington was the director of the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, and wielded tremendous influence within the African-American and white communities. Washington was the architect of the Atlanta Compromise, an unwritten deal that he had struck in 1895 with Southern white leaders who dominated state governments after Reconstruction. Essentially the agreement provided that Southern blacks, who overwhelmingly lived in rural communities, would submit to the current discrimination, segregation, disenfranchisement, and non-unionized employment; that Southern whites would permit blacks to receive a basic education, some economic opportunities, and justice within the legal system; and that Northern whites would invest in Southern enterprises and fund black educational charities.

Despite sending congratulations to Washington for his Atlanta Exposition Speech, Du Bois later came to oppose Washington&#x27;s plan, along with many other African Americans, including Archibald H. Grimke, Kelly Miller, James Weldon Johnson, and Paul Laurence Dunbar – representatives of the class of educated blacks that Du Bois later called the &quot;talented tenth&quot;. Du Bois felt that African Americans should fight for equal rights and higher opportunities, rather than passively submit to the segregation and discrimination of Washington&#x27;s Atlanta Compromise.

Du Bois was inspired to greater activism by the lynching of Sam Hose, which occurred near Atlanta in 1899. Hose was tortured, burned, and hanged by a mob of two thousand whites. When walking through Atlanta to discuss the lynching with newspaper editor Joel Chandler Harris, Du Bois encountered Hose&#x27;s burned knuckles in a storefront display. The episode stunned Du Bois, and he resolved that &quot;one could not be a calm, cool, and detached scientist while Negroes were lynched, murdered, and starved&quot;. Du Bois realized that &quot;the cure wasn&#x27;t simply telling people the truth, it was inducing them to act on the truth&quot;.

In 1901, Du Bois wrote a review critical of Washington&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Up from Slavery&quot;, which he later expanded and published to a wider audience as the essay &quot;Of Mr. Booker T. Washington and Others&quot; in &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot;. Later in life, Du Bois regretted having been critical of Washington in those essays. One of the contrasts between the two leaders was their approach to education: Washington felt that African-American schools should focus primarily on industrial education topics such as agricultural and mechanical skills, to prepare southern blacks for the opportunities in the rural areas where most lived. Du Bois felt that black schools should focus more on liberal arts and academic curriculum (including the classics, arts, and humanities), because liberal arts were required to develop a leadership elite.

However, as sociologist E. Franklin Frazier and economists Gunnar Myrdal and Thomas Sowell have argued, such disagreement over education was a minor point of difference between Washington and Du Bois; both men acknowledged the importance of the form of education that the other emphasized. Sowell has also argued that, despite genuine disagreements between the two leaders, the supposed animosity between Washington and Du Bois actually formed among their followers, not between Washington and Du Bois themselves. Du Bois also made this observation in an interview published in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in November 1965.

===Niagara Movement===


In 1905, Du Bois and several other African-American civil rights activists – including Fredrick McGhee, Max Barber and William Monroe Trotter – met in Canada, near Niagara Falls, where they wrote a declaration of principles opposing the Atlanta Compromise, and which were incorporated as the Niagara Movement in 1906. They wanted to publicize their ideals to other African Americans, but most black periodicals were owned by publishers sympathetic to Washington, so Du Bois bought a printing press and started publishing &quot;Moon Illustrated Weekly&quot; in December 1905. It was the first African-American illustrated weekly, and Du Bois used it to attack Washington&#x27;s positions, but the magazine lasted only for about eight months. Du Bois soon founded and edited another vehicle for his polemics, &quot;The Horizon: A Journal of the Color Line&quot;, which debuted in 1907. Freeman H. M. Murray and Lafayette M. Hershaw served as &quot;The Horizon&quot;&#x27;s co-editors.

The Niagarites held a second conference in August 1906, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of abolitionist John Brown&#x27;s birth, at the West Virginia site of Brown&#x27;s raid on Harper&#x27;s Ferry. Reverdy C. Ransom spoke, explaining that Washington&#x27;s primary goal was to prepare blacks for employment in their current society: &quot;Today, two classes of Negroes ...are standing at the parting of the ways. The one counsels patient submission to our present humiliations and degradations ... The other class believe that it should not submit to being humiliated, degraded, and remanded to an inferior place. ...[I]t does not believe in bartering its manhood for the sake of gain.&quot;

===&quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot;===
In an effort to portray the genius and humanity of the black race, Du Bois published &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot; (1903), a collection of 14 essays. James Weldon Johnson said the book&#x27;s effect on African Americans was comparable to that of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. The introduction famously proclaimed that &quot;the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color line&quot;. Each chapter begins with two epigraphs – one from a white poet, and one from a black spiritual – to demonstrate intellectual and cultural parity between black and white cultures.

A major theme of the work was the double consciousness faced by African Americans: being both American and black. This was a unique identity which, according to Du Bois, had been a handicap in the past, but could be a strength in the future: &quot;Henceforth, the destiny of the race could be conceived as leading neither to assimilation nor separatism but to proud, enduring hyphenation.&quot;
Jonathon S. Kahn in &quot;Divine Discontent: The Religious Imagination of Du Bois&quot; shows how Du Bois, in his &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot;, represents an exemplary text of pragmatic religious naturalism. On page 12, Kahn writes: &quot;Du Bois needs to be understood as an African American pragmatic religious naturalist. By this I mean that, like Du Bois the American traditional pragmatic religious naturalism, which runs through William James, George Santayana, and John Dewey, seeks religion without metaphysical foundations.&quot; Kahn&#x27;s interpretation of religious naturalism is very broad but he relates it to specific thinkers. Du Bois&#x27;s anti-metaphysical viewpoint places him in the sphere of religious naturalism as typified by William James and others.

===Racial violence===
Two calamities in the autumn of 1906 shocked African Americans, and they contributed to strengthening support for Du Bois&#x27;s struggle for civil rights to prevail over Booker T. Washington&#x27;s accommodationist Atlanta Compromise. First, President Theodore Roosevelt dishonorably discharged 167 Buffalo Soldiers because they were accused of crimes as a result of the Brownsville affair. Many of the discharged soldiers had served for 20 years and were near retirement. Second, in September, riots broke out in Atlanta, precipitated by unfounded allegations of black men assaulting white women. This was a catalyst for racial tensions based on a job shortage and employers playing black workers against white workers. Ten thousand whites rampaged through Atlanta, beating every black person they could find, resulting in over 25 deaths. In the aftermath of the 1906 violence, Du Bois urged blacks to withdraw their support from the Republican Party, because Republicans Roosevelt and William Howard Taft did not sufficiently support blacks. Most African Americans had been loyal to the Republican Party since the time of Abraham Lincoln. Du Bois endorsed Taft&#x27;s rival William Jennings Bryan in the 1908 presidential election despite Bryan&#x27;s acceptance of segregation.

Du Bois wrote the essay, &quot;A Litany at Atlanta&quot;, which asserted that the riot demonstrated that the Atlanta Compromise was a failure. Despite upholding their end of the bargain, blacks had failed to receive legal justice in the South. Historian David Levering Lewis has written that the Compromise no longer held because white patrician planters, who took a paternalistic role, had been replaced by aggressive businessmen who were willing to pit blacks against whites. These two calamities were watershed events for the African American community, marking the ascendancy of Du Bois&#x27;s vision of equal rights.

===Academic work===
In addition to writing editorials, Du Bois continued to produce scholarly work at Atlanta University. In 1909, after five years of effort, he published a biography of abolitionist John Brown. It contained many insights, but also contained some factual errors. The work was strongly criticized by &quot;The Nation&quot;, which was owned by Oswald Garrison Villard, who was writing his own, competing biography of John Brown. Possibly as a result, Du Bois&#x27;s work was largely ignored by white scholars. After publishing a piece in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine warning of the end of &quot;white supremacy&quot;, Du Bois had difficulty getting pieces accepted by major periodicals, although he did continue to publish columns regularly in &quot;The Horizon&quot; magazine.

Du Bois was the first African American invited by the American Historical Association (AHA) to present a paper at their annual conference. He read his paper, &quot;Reconstruction and Its Benefits,&quot; to an astounded audience at the AHA&#x27;s December 1909 conference. The paper went against the mainstream historical view, promoted by the Dunning School of scholars at Columbia University, that Reconstruction was a disaster, caused by the ineptitude and sloth of blacks. To the contrary, Du Bois asserted that the brief period of African-American leadership in the South accomplished three important goals: democracy, free public schools, and new social welfare legislation.

Du Bois asserted that it was the federal government&#x27;s failure to manage the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, to distribute land, and to establish an educational system, that doomed African-American prospects in the South. When Du Bois submitted the paper for publication a few months later in &quot;The American Historical Review&quot;, he asked that the word &#x27;Negro&#x27; be capitalized. The editor, J. Franklin Jameson, refused, and published the paper without the capitalization. The paper was mostly ignored by white historians. Du Bois later developed his paper as his 1935 book, &quot;Black Reconstruction in America,&quot; which marshaled extensive references to support his assertions. The AHA did not invite another African-American speaker until 1940.

==NAACP era==
In May 1909, Du Bois attended the National Negro Conference in New York. The meeting led to the creation of the National Negro Committee, chaired by Oswald Garrison Villard, and dedicated to campaigning for civil rights, equal voting rights, and equal educational opportunities. The following spring, in 1910, at the second National Negro Conference, the attendees created the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). At Du Bois&#x27;s suggestion, the word &quot;colored&quot;, rather than &quot;black&quot;, was used to include &quot;dark skinned people everywhere&quot;. Dozens of civil rights supporters, black and white, participated in the founding, but most executive officers were white, including Mary White Ovington, Charles Edward Russell, William English Walling, and its first president, Moorfield Storey.

Feeling inspired by this, Indian social reformer and civil rights activist B. R. Ambedkar contacted Du Bois in the 1940s. In a letter to Du Bois in 1946, he introduced himself as a member of the &quot;Untouchables of India&quot; and &quot;a student of the Negro problem&quot; and expressed his interest in the NAACP&#x27;s petition to the United Nations. He noted that his group was &quot;thinking of following suit&quot;; and requested copies of the proposed statement from Du Bois. In a letter dated July 31, 1946, Du Bois responded by telling Ambedkar he was familiar with his name, and that he had &quot;every sympathy with the Untouchables of India.&quot;

===&quot;The Crisis&quot;===
NAACP leaders offered Du Bois the position of Director of Publicity and Research. He accepted the job in the summer of 1910, and moved to New York after resigning from Atlanta University. His primary duty was editing the NAACP&#x27;s monthly magazine, which he named &quot;The Crisis&quot;. The first issue appeared in November 1910, and Du Bois wrote that its aim was to set out &quot;those facts and arguments which show the danger of race prejudice, particularly as manifested today toward colored people&quot;. The journal was phenomenally successful, and its circulation reached 100,000 in 1920. Typical articles in the early editions polemics against the dishonesty and parochialism of black churches, and discussions on the Afrocentric origins of Egyptian civilization. Du Bois&#x27;s African-centered view of ancient Egypt was in direct opposition to many Egyptologists of his day, including Flinders Petrie, whom Du Bois had met at a conference.

A 1911 Du Bois editorial helped initiate a nationwide push to induce the federal government to outlaw lynching. Du Bois, employing the sarcasm he frequently used, commented on a lynching in Pennsylvania: &quot;The point is he was black. Blackness must be punished. Blackness is the crime of crimes ... It is therefore necessary, as every white scoundrel in the nation knows, to let slip no opportunity of punishing this crime of crimes. Of course if possible, the pretext should be great and overwhelming – some awful stunning crime, made even more horrible by the reporters&#x27; imagination. Failing this, mere murder, arson, barn burning or impudence may do.&quot;

&quot;The Crisis&quot; carried Du Bois editorials supporting the ideals of unionized labor but denouncing its leaders&#x27; racism; blacks were barred from membership. Du Bois also supported the principles of the Socialist Party of America (he held party membership from 1910 to 1912), but he denounced the racism demonstrated by some socialist leaders. Frustrated by Republican president Taft&#x27;s failure to address widespread lynching, Du Bois endorsed Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 presidential race, in exchange for Wilson&#x27;s promise to support black causes.

Throughout his writings, Du Bois supported women&#x27;s rights and women&#x27;s suffrage, but he found it difficult to publicly endorse the American suffragist movement because leaders of the movement refused to support his fight against racial injustice. A 1913 &quot;Crisis&quot; editorial broached the taboo subject of interracial marriage: although Du Bois generally expected persons to marry within their race, he viewed the problem as a women&#x27;s rights issue, because laws prohibited white men from marrying black women. Du Bois wrote &quot;[anti-miscegenation] laws leave the colored girls absolutely helpless for the lust of white men. It reduces colored women in the eyes of the law to the position of dogs. As low as the white girl falls, she can compel her seducer to marry her ... We must kill [anti-miscegenation laws] not because we are anxious to marry the white men&#x27;s sisters, but because we are determined that white men will leave our sisters alone.&quot;

During 1915−1916, some leaders of the NAACP – disturbed by financial losses at &quot;The Crisis&quot;, and worried about the inflammatory rhetoric of some of its essays – attempted to oust Du Bois from his editorial position. Du Bois and his supporters prevailed, and he continued in his role as editor. In a 1919 column titled &quot;The True Brownies&quot;, he announced the creation of &quot;The Brownies&#x27; Book&quot;, the first magazine published for African-American children and youth, which he founded with Augustus Granville Dill and Jessie Redmon Fauset.

===Historian and author===
The 1910s were a productive time for Du Bois. In 1911, he attended the First Universal Races Congress in London and he published his first novel, &quot;The Quest of the Silver Fleece.&quot; Two years later, Du Bois wrote, produced, and directed a pageant for the stage, &quot;The Star of Ethiopia&quot;. In 1915, Du Bois published &quot;The Negro&quot;, a general history of black Africans, and the first of its kind in English. The book rebutted claims of African inferiority, and came to serve as the basis of much Afrocentric historiography in the 20th century. &quot;The Negro&quot; predicted unity and solidarity for colored people around the world, and it influenced many who supported the Pan-African movement.

In 1915, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; carried a Du Bois essay, &quot;The African Roots of the War&quot;, which consolidated his ideas on capitalism, imperialism, and race. He argued that the Scramble for Africa was at the root of World War I. He also anticipated later communist doctrine, by suggesting that wealthy capitalists had pacified white workers by giving them just enough wealth to prevent them from revolting, and by threatening them with competition by the lower-cost labor of colored workers.

===Combating racism===
Du Bois used his influential NAACP position to oppose a variety of racist incidents. When the silent film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; premiered in 1915, Du Bois and the NAACP led the fight to ban the movie, because of its racist portrayal of blacks as brutish and lustful. The fight was not successful, and possibly contributed to the film&#x27;s fame, but the publicity drew many new supporters to the NAACP.

The private sector was not the only source of racism: under President Wilson, the plight of African Americans in government jobs suffered. Many federal agencies adopted whites-only employment practices, the Army excluded blacks from officer ranks, and the immigration service prohibited the immigration of persons of African ancestry. Du Bois wrote an editorial in 1914 deploring the dismissal of blacks from federal posts, and he supported William Monroe Trotter when Trotter brusquely confronted Wilson about the President&#x27;s failure to fulfill his campaign promise of justice for blacks.

&quot;The Crisis&quot; continued to wage a campaign against lynching. In 1915, it published an article with a year-by-year tabulation of 2,732 lynchings from 1884 to 1914. The April 1916 edition covered the group lynching of six African Americans in Lee County, Georgia. Later in the June 1916 issue, the &quot;Waco Horror&quot; article covered the lynching of Jesse Washington, a mentally impaired 17-year-old African American. Du Bois included photographs of it in the article. The article broke new ground by utilizing undercover reporting to expose the conduct of local whites in Waco, Texas.

The early 20th century was the era of the Great Migration of blacks from the Southern United States to the Northeast, Midwest, and West. Du Bois wrote an editorial supporting the Great Migration, because he felt it would help blacks escape Southern racism, find economic opportunities, and assimilate into American society.

Also in the 1910s the American eugenics movement was in its infancy, and many leading eugenicists were openly racist, defining Blacks as &quot;a lower race&quot;. Du Bois opposed this view as an unscientific aberration, but still maintained the basic principle of eugenics: that different persons have different inborn characteristics that make them more or less suited for specific kinds of employment, and that by encouraging the most talented members of all races to procreate would better the &quot;stocks&quot; of humanity.

===World War I===
As the United States prepared to enter World War I in 1917, Du Bois&#x27;s colleague in the NAACP, Joel Spingarn, established a camp to train African Americans to serve as officers in the United States Armed Forces. The camp was controversial, because some whites felt that blacks were not qualified to be officers, and some blacks felt that African Americans should not participate in what they considered a white man&#x27;s war. Du Bois supported Spingarn&#x27;s training camp, but was disappointed when the Army forcibly retired one of its few black officers, Charles Young, on a pretense of ill health. The Army agreed to create 1,000 officer positions for blacks, but insisted that 250 come from enlisted men, conditioned to taking orders from whites, rather than from independent-minded blacks who came from the camp. Over 700,000 blacks enlisted on the first day of the draft, but were subject to discriminatory conditions which prompted vocal protests from Du Bois.

After the East St. Louis riots occurred in the summer of 1917, Du Bois traveled to St. Louis to report on the riots. Between 40 and 250 African Americans were massacred by whites, primarily due to resentment caused by St. Louis industry hiring blacks to replace striking white workers. Du Bois&#x27;s reporting resulted in an article &quot;The Massacre of East St. Louis&quot;, published in the September issue of &quot;The Crisis&quot;, which contained photographs and interviews detailing the violence. Historian David Levering Lewis concluded that Du Bois distorted some of the facts in order to increase the propaganda value of the article. To publicly demonstrate the black community&#x27;s outrage over the riots, Du Bois organized the Silent Parade, a march of around 9,000 African Americans down New York City&#x27;s Fifth Avenue, the first parade of its kind in New York, and the second instance of blacks publicly demonstrating for civil rights.

The Houston riot of 1917 disturbed Du Bois and was a major setback to efforts to permit African Americans to become military officers. The riot began after Houston police arrested and beat two black soldiers; in response, over 100 black soldiers took to the streets of Houston and killed 16 whites. A military court martial was held, and 19 of the soldiers were hanged, and 67 others were imprisoned. In spite of the Houston riot, Du Bois and others successfully pressed the Army to accept the officers trained at Spingarn&#x27;s camp, resulting in over 600 black officers joining the Army in October 1917.

Federal officials, concerned about subversive viewpoints expressed by NAACP leaders, attempted to frighten the NAACP by threatening it with investigations. Du Bois was not intimidated, and in 1918 he predicted that World War I would lead to an overthrow of the European colonial system and to the &quot;liberation&quot; of colored people worldwide – in China, in India, and especially in the Americas. NAACP chairman Joel Spingarn was enthusiastic about the war, and he persuaded Du Bois to consider an officer&#x27;s commission in the Army, contingent on Du Bois writing an editorial repudiating his anti-war stance. Du Bois accepted this bargain and wrote the pro-war &quot;Close Ranks&quot; editorial in June 1918 and soon thereafter he received a commission in the Army. Many black leaders, who wanted to leverage the war to gain civil rights for African Americans, criticized Du Bois for his sudden reversal. Southern officers in Du Bois&#x27;s unit objected to his presence, and his commission was withdrawn.

===After the war===
When the war ended, Du Bois traveled to Europe in 1919 to attend the first Pan-African Congress and to interview African-American soldiers for a planned book on their experiences in World War I. He was trailed by U.S. agents who were searching for evidence of treasonous activities. Du Bois discovered that the vast majority of black American soldiers were relegated to menial labor as stevedores and laborers. Some units were armed, and one in particular, the 92nd Division (the Buffalo soldiers), engaged in combat. Du Bois discovered widespread racism in the Army, and concluded that the Army command discouraged African Americans from joining the Army, discredited the accomplishments of black soldiers, and promoted bigotry.

Du Bois returned from Europe more determined than ever to gain equal rights for African Americans. Black soldiers returning from overseas felt a new sense of power and worth, and were representative of an emerging attitude referred to as the New Negro. In the editorial &quot;Returning Soldiers&quot; he wrote: &quot;But, by the God of Heaven, we are cowards and jackasses if, now that the war is over, we do not marshal every ounce of our brain and brawn to fight a sterner, longer, more unbending battle against the forces of hell in our own land.&quot;

Many blacks moved to northern cities in search of work, and some northern white workers resented the competition. This labor strife was one of the causes of the Red Summer, a series of race riots across America in 1919, in which over 300 African Americans were killed in over 30 cities. Du Bois documented the atrocities in the pages of &quot;The Crisis&quot;, culminating in the December publication of a gruesome photograph of a lynching that occurred during a race riot in Omaha, Nebraska.

The most violent episode during the Red Summer was a massacre in Elaine, Arkansas in which nearly 200 blacks were murdered. Reports coming out of the South blamed the blacks, alleging that they were conspiring to take over the government. Infuriated with the distortions, Du Bois published a letter in the &quot;New York World&quot;, claiming that the only crime the black sharecroppers had committed was daring to challenge their white landlords by hiring an attorney to investigate contractual irregularities.

Over 60 of the surviving blacks were arrested and tried for conspiracy, in the case known as &quot;Moore v. Dempsey&quot;. Du Bois rallied blacks across America to raise funds for the legal defense, which, six years later, resulted in a Supreme Court ruling authored by Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. Although the victory had little immediate impact on justice for blacks in the South, it marked the first time the federal government used the 14th Amendment guarantee of due process to prevent states from shielding mob violence.

In 1920, Du Bois published &quot;&quot;, the first of his three autobiographies. The &quot;veil&quot; was that which covered colored people around the world. In the book, he hoped to lift the veil and show white readers what life was like behind the veil, and how it distorted the viewpoints of those looking through it – in both directions. The book contained Du Bois&#x27;s feminist essay, &quot;The Damnation of Women&quot;, which was a tribute to the dignity and worth of women, particularly black women.

Concerned that textbooks used by African-American children ignored black history and culture, Du Bois created a monthly children&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The Brownies&#x27; Book&quot;. Initially published in 1920, it was aimed at black children, who Du Bois called &quot;the children of the sun&quot;.

===Pan-Africanism and Marcus Garvey===
Du Bois traveled to Europe in 1921 to attend the second Pan-African Congress. The assembled black leaders from around the world issued the &quot;London Resolutions&quot; and established a Pan-African Association headquarters in Paris. Under Du Bois&#x27;s guidance, the resolutions insisted on racial equality, and that Africa be ruled &quot;by&quot; Africans (not, as in the 1919 congress, with the &quot;consent&quot; of Africans). Du Bois restated the resolutions of the congress in his &quot;Manifesto to the League of Nations&quot;, which implored the newly formed League of Nations to address labor issues and to appoint Africans to key posts. The League took little action on the requests.

Jamaican activist Marcus Garvey, promoter of the Back-to-Africa movement and founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), denounced Du Bois&#x27;s efforts to achieve equality through integration, and instead endorsed racial separatism. Du Bois initially supported the concept of Garvey&#x27;s Black Star Line, a shipping company that was intended to facilitate commerce within the African diaspora. But Du Bois later became concerned that Garvey was threatening the NAACP&#x27;s efforts, leading Du Bois to describe him as fraudulent and reckless. Responding to Garvey&#x27;s slogan &quot;Africa for the Africans&quot;, Du Bois said that he supported that concept, but denounced Garvey&#x27;s intention that Africa be ruled by African Americans.

Du Bois wrote a series of articles in &quot;The Crisis&quot; between 1922 and 1924 attacking Garvey&#x27;s movement, calling him the &quot;most dangerous enemy of the Negro race in America and the world.&quot; Du Bois and Garvey never made a serious attempt to collaborate, and their dispute was partly rooted in the desire of their respective organizations (NAACP and UNIA) to capture a larger portion of the available philanthropic funding.

Du Bois decried Harvard&#x27;s decision to ban blacks from its dormitories in 1921 as an instance of a broad effort in the U.S. to renew &quot;the Anglo-Saxon cult; the worship of the Nordic totem, the disfranchisement of Negro, Jew, Irishman, Italian, Hungarian, Asiatic and South Sea Islander – the world rule of Nordic white through brute force.&quot; When Du Bois sailed for Europe in 1923 for the third Pan-African Congress, the circulation of &quot;The Crisis&quot; had declined to 60,000 from its World War I high of 100,000, but it remained the preeminent periodical of the civil rights movement. President Calvin Coolidge designated Du Bois an &quot;Envoy Extraordinary&quot; to Liberia and – after the third congress concluded – Du Bois rode a German freighter from the Canary Islands to Africa, visiting Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Senegal.

===Harlem Renaissance===
Du Bois frequently promoted African-American artistic creativity in his writings, and when the Harlem Renaissance emerged in the mid-1920s, his article &quot;A Negro Art Renaissance&quot; celebrated the end of the long hiatus of blacks from creative endeavors. His enthusiasm for the Harlem Renaissance waned as he came to believe that many whites visited Harlem for voyeurism, not for genuine appreciation of black art. Du Bois insisted that artists recognize their moral responsibilities, writing that &quot;a black artist is first of all a &quot;black&quot; artist.&quot; He was also concerned that black artists were not using their art to promote black causes, saying &quot;I do not care a damn for any art that is not used for propaganda.&quot; By the end of 1926, he stopped employing &quot;The Crisis&quot; to support the arts.

===Debate with Lothrop Stoddard===
In 1929, a debate organised by the Chicago Forum Council billed as &quot;One of the greatest debates ever held&quot; was held between Du Bois and Lothrop Stoddard, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, proponent of eugenics and so-called scientific racism. The debate was held in Chicago and Du Bois was arguing the affirmative to the question &quot;Shall the Negro be encouraged to seek cultural equality? Has the Negro the same intellectual possibilities as other races?&quot;

Du Bois knew that the racists would be unintentionally funny onstage; as he wrote to Moore, Senator J. Thomas Heflin &quot;would be a scream&quot; in a debate. Du Bois let the overconfident and bombastic Stoddard walk into a comic moment, which Stoddard then made even funnier by not getting the joke. This moment was captured in headlines &quot;DuBois Shatters Stoddard&#x27;s Cultural Theories in Debate; Thousands Jam Hall ... Cheered as He Proves Race Equality,&quot; &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot;″s front-page headline ran &quot;5,000 Cheer W.E.B. DuBois, Laugh at Lothrop Stoddard&quot;. Ian Frazier of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrotes that the comic potential of Stoddard&#x27;s bankrupt ideas was left untapped until Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;.

===Socialism===
When Du Bois became editor of &quot;The Crisis&quot; magazine in 1911, he joined the Socialist Party of America on the advice of NAACP founders Mary White Ovington, William English Walling and Charles Edward Russell. However, he supported the Democrat Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 presidential campaign, a breach of the rules, and was forced to resign from the Socialist Party. In 1913, his support for Wilson was shaken when racial segregation in government hiring was reported. Du Bois remained &quot;convinced that socialism was an excellent way of life, but I thought it might be reached by various methods.&quot;

Nine years after the 1917 Russian Revolution, Du Bois extended a trip to Europe to include a visit to the Soviet Union, where he was struck by the poverty and disorganization he encountered in the Soviet Union, yet was impressed by the intense labors of the officials and by the recognition given to workers. Although Du Bois was not yet familiar with the communist theories of Karl Marx or Vladimir Lenin, he concluded that socialism might be a better path towards racial equality than capitalism.

Although Du Bois generally endorsed socialist principles, his politics were strictly pragmatic: in the 1929 New York City mayoral election, he endorsed Democrat Jimmy Walker for mayor of New York, rather than the socialist Norman Thomas, believing that Walker could do more immediate good for blacks, even though Thomas&#x27;s platform was more consistent with Du Bois&#x27;s views. Throughout the 1920s, Du Bois and the NAACP shifted support back and forth between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, induced by promises from the candidates to fight lynchings, improve working conditions, or support voting rights in the South; invariably, the candidates failed to deliver on their promises.

A rivalry emerged in 1931 between the NAACP and the Communist Party, when the communists responded quickly and effectively to support the Scottsboro Boys, nine African American youth arrested in 1931 in Alabama for rape. Du Bois and the NAACP felt that the case would not be beneficial to their cause, so they chose to let the Communist Party organize the defense efforts. Du Bois was impressed with the vast amount of publicity and funds which the communists devoted to the partially successful defense effort, and he came to suspect that the communists were attempting to present their party to African Americans as a better solution than the NAACP.

Responding to criticisms of the NAACP from the Communist Party, Du Bois wrote articles condemning the party, claiming that it unfairly attacked the NAACP, and that it failed to fully appreciate racism in the United States. In their turn, the communist leaders accused him of being a &quot;class enemy&quot;, and claimed that the NAACP leadership was an isolated elite, disconnected from the working-class blacks they ostensibly fought for.

==Return to Atlanta==
Du Bois did not have a good working relationship with Walter White, president of the NAACP since 1931. That conflict, combined with the financial stresses of the Great Depression, precipitated a power struggle over &quot;The Crisis&quot;. Du Bois, concerned that his position as editor would be eliminated, resigned his job at &quot;The Crisis&quot; and accepted an academic position at Atlanta University in early 1933. The rift with the NAACP grew larger in 1934 when Du Bois reversed his stance on segregation, stating that &quot;separate but equal&quot; was an acceptable goal for African Americans. The NAACP leadership was stunned, and asked Du Bois to retract his statement, but he refused, and the dispute led to Du Bois&#x27;s resignation from the NAACP.

After arriving at his new professorship in Atlanta, Du Bois wrote a series of articles generally supportive of Marxism. He was not a strong proponent of labor unions or the Communist Party, but he felt that Marx&#x27;s scientific explanation of society and the economy were useful for explaining the situation of African Americans in the United States. Marx&#x27;s atheism also struck a chord with Du Bois, who routinely criticized black churches for dulling blacks&#x27; sensitivity to racism. In his 1933 writings, Du Bois embraced socialism, but asserted that &quot;[c]olored labor has no common ground with white labor&quot;, a controversial position that was rooted in Du Bois&#x27;s dislike of American labor unions, which had systematically excluded blacks for decades. Du Bois did not support the Communist Party in the U.S. and did not vote for their candidate in the 1932 presidential election, in spite of an African American on their ticket.

===&quot;Black Reconstruction in America&quot;===

Back in the world of academia, Du Bois was able to resume his study of Reconstruction, the topic of the 1910 paper that he presented to the American Historical Association. In 1935, he published his magnum opus, &quot;Black Reconstruction in America&quot;. The book presented the thesis, in the words of the historian David Levering Lewis, that &quot;black people, suddenly admitted to citizenship in an environment of feral hostility, displayed admirable volition and intelligence as well as the indolence and ignorance inherent in three centuries of bondage.&quot;

Du Bois documented how black people were central figures in the American Civil War and Reconstruction era, and also showed how they made alliances with white politicians. He provided evidence that the coalition governments established public education in the South, and many needed social service programs. The book also demonstrated how black emancipation – the crux of Reconstruction – promoted a radical restructuring of United States society, as well as how and why the country failed to continue support for civil rights for blacks in the aftermath of Reconstruction.

The book&#x27;s thesis ran counter to the orthodox interpretation of Reconstruction maintained by white historians, and the book was virtually ignored by mainstream historians until the 1960s. Thereafter, however, it ignited a &quot;revisionist&quot; trend in the historiography of Reconstruction, which emphasized black people&#x27;s search for freedom and the era&#x27;s radical policy changes. By the 21st century, &quot;Black Reconstruction&quot; was widely perceived as &quot;the foundational text of revisionist African American historiography.&quot;

In the final chapter of the book, &quot;XIV. The Propaganda of History&quot;, Du Bois evokes his efforts at writing an article for the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; on the &quot;history of the American Negro&quot;. After the editors had cut all reference to Reconstruction, he insisted that the following note appear in the entry: &quot;White historians have ascribed the faults and failures of Reconstruction to Negro ignorance and corruption. But the Negro insists that it was Negro loyalty and the Negro vote alone that restored the South to the Union; established the new democracy, both for white and black, and instituted the public schools.&quot; The editors refused and, so, Du Bois withdrew his article.

===Projected encyclopedia===
In 1932, Du Bois was selected by several philanthropies, including the Phelps Stokes Fund, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, and the General Education Board, to be the managing editor for a proposed &quot;Encyclopedia of the Negro&quot;, a work which Du Bois had been contemplating for 30 years. After several years of planning and organizing, the philanthropies canceled the project in 1938 because some board members believed that Du Bois was too biased to produce an objective encyclopedia.

===Trip around the world===
Du Bois took a trip around the world in 1936, which included visits to Germany, China, and Japan. While in Germany, Du Bois remarked that he was treated with warmth and respect. After his return to the United States, he expressed his ambivalence about the Nazi regime. He admired how the Nazis had improved the German economy, but he was horrified by their treatment of the Jewish people, which he described as &quot;an attack on civilization, comparable only to such horrors as the Spanish Inquisition and the African slave trade&quot;.

Following the 1905 Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War, Du Bois became impressed by the growing strength of Imperial Japan. He came to view the ascendant Japanese Empire as an antidote to Western imperialism, arguing for over three decades after the war that its rise represented a chance to break the monopoly that white nations had on international affairs. A representative of Japan&#x27;s &quot;Negro Propaganda Operations&quot; traveled to the United States during the 1920s and 1930s, meeting with Du Bois and giving him a positive impression of Imperial Japan&#x27;s racial policies.

In 1936, the Japanese ambassador arranged a trip to Japan for Du Bois and a small group of academics, visiting China, Japan, and Manchukuo (Manchuria). Du Bois viewed Japanese colonialism in Manchuria as benevolent; he wrote that &quot;colonial enterprise by a colored nation need not imply the caste, exploitation and subjection which it has always implied in the case of white Europe.&quot; He also believed that it was natural for Chinese and Japanese to quarrel with each other as &quot;relatives&quot; and that the segregated schools in Manchuria were established because the natives spoke Chinese only. While disturbed by the eventual Japanese alliance with Nazi Germany, Du Bois also argued Japan was only compelled to enter the pact because of the hostility of the United States and United Kingdom, and he viewed American apprehensions over Japanese expansion in Asia as racially motivated both before and after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He was similarly disturbed by how Chinese culture might be extinguished under Japanese rule but argued that Western imperialism was a greater existential concern.

===World War II===
Du Bois opposed the US intervention in World War II, particularly in the Pacific War, because he believed that China and Japan were emerging from the clutches of white imperialists. He felt that the European Allies waging war against Japan was an opportunity for whites to reestablish their influence in Asia. He was deeply disappointed by the US government&#x27;s plan for African Americans in the armed forces: Blacks were limited to 5.8% of the force, and there were to be no African-American combat units – virtually the same restrictions as in World War I. With blacks threatening to shift their support to President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Republican opponent Wendell Willkie in the 1940 election, Roosevelt appointed a few blacks to leadership posts in the military.

&quot;Dusk of Dawn&quot;, Du Bois&#x27;s second autobiography, was published in 1940. The title refers to his hope that African Americans were passing out of the darkness of racism into an era of greater equality. The work is part autobiography, part history, and part sociological treatise. Du Bois described the book as &quot;the autobiography of a concept of race ... elucidated and magnified and doubtless distorted in the thoughts and deeds which were mine ... Thus for all time my life is significant for all lives of men.&quot;

In 1943, at age 75, Du Bois was abruptly fired from his position at Atlanta University by college president Rufus Early Clement. Many scholars expressed outrage, prompting Atlanta University to provide Du Bois with a lifelong pension and the title of professor emeritus. Arthur Spingarn remarked that Du Bois spent his time in Atlanta &quot;battering his life out against ignorance, bigotry, intolerance and slothfulness, projecting ideas nobody but he understands, and raising hopes for change which may be comprehended in a hundred years.&quot;

Turning down job offers from Fisk and Howard, Du Bois re-joined the NAACP as director of the Department of Special Research. Surprising many NAACP leaders, Du Bois jumped into the job with vigor and determination. During his 10−years hiatus, the NAACP&#x27;s income had increased fourfold, and its membership had soared to 325,000 members.

==Later life==
===United Nations===
Du Bois was a member of the three-person delegation from the NAACP that attended the 1945 conference in San Francisco at which the United Nations was established. The NAACP delegation wanted the United Nations to endorse racial equality and to bring an end to the colonial era. To push the United Nations in that direction, Du Bois drafted a proposal that pronounced &quot;[t]he colonial system of government ... is undemocratic, socially dangerous and a main cause of wars&quot;. The NAACP proposal received support from China, India, and the Soviet Union, but it was virtually ignored by the other major powers, and the NAACP proposals were not included in the final United Nations Charter.

After the United Nations conference, Du Bois published &quot;Color and Democracy: Colonies and Peace&quot;, a book that attacked colonial empires and, in the words of a most sympathetic reviewer, &quot;contains enough dynamite to blow up the whole vicious system whereby we have comforted our white souls and lined the pockets of generations of free-booting capitalists.&quot;

In late 1945, Du Bois attended the fifth, and final, Pan-African Congress, in Manchester, England. The congress was the most productive of the five congresses, and there Du Bois met Kwame Nkrumah, the future first president of Ghana, who later invited him to Africa.

Du Bois helped to submit petitions to the UN concerning discrimination against African Americans, the most noteworthy of which was the NAACP&#x27;s &quot;An Appeal to the World: A Statement on the Denial of Human Rights to Minorities in the Case of Citizens of Negro Descent in the United States of America and an Appeal to the United Nations for Redress&quot;. This advocacy laid the foundation for the later report and petition called &quot;We Charge Genocide&quot;, submitted in 1951 by the Civil Rights Congress. &quot;We Charge Genocide&quot; accuses the U.S. of systematically sanctioning murders and inflicting harm against African Americans and therefore committing genocide.

===Cold War===
When the Cold War commenced in the mid-1940s, the NAACP distanced itself from communists, lest its funding or reputation suffer. The NAACP redoubled its efforts in 1947 after &quot;Life&quot; magazine published a piece by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. claiming that the NAACP was heavily influenced by communists. Ignoring the NAACP&#x27;s desires, Du Bois continued to fraternize with communist sympathizers such as Paul Robeson, Howard Fast and Shirley Graham (his future second wife). Du Bois wrote &quot;I am not a communist ... On the other hand, I ... believe ... that Karl Marx ... put his finger squarely upon our difficulties ...&quot;.

In 1946, Du Bois wrote articles giving his assessment of the Soviet Union; he did not embrace communism and he criticized its dictatorship. However, he felt that capitalism was responsible for poverty and racism, and felt that socialism was an alternative that might ameliorate those problems. The Soviets explicitly rejected racial distinctions and class distinctions, leading Du Bois to conclude that the USSR was the &quot;most hopeful country on earth&quot;.

Du Bois&#x27;s association with prominent communists made him a liability for the NAACP, especially since the Federal Bureau of Investigation was starting to aggressively investigate communist sympathizers; so – by mutual agreement – he resigned from the NAACP for the second time in late 1948. After departing the NAACP, Du Bois started writing regularly for the leftist weekly newspaper the &quot;National Guardian&quot;, a relationship that endured until 1961.

Du Bois was an early supporter of Zionism. He viewed Palestinians as uncivilized and viewed Islam as the main factor in what he saw as a lack of progress. However, he did not express support for Israel during the Suez Crisis, instead backing Gamal Abdel Nasser. Nadia Alahmed contends that Du Bois came to view &quot;Nasser as a Pan-African symbol, a power to resist Western&quot; neo-colonialism and that Du Bois&#x27;s poem &quot;Suez&quot; influenced Malcolm X and the Black Power Movement in forming Black-Palestinian solidarity.

===Peace activism===
Du Bois was a lifelong anti-war activist, but his efforts became more pronounced after World War II. In 1949, Du Bois spoke at the Scientific and Cultural Conference for World Peace in New York: &quot;I tell you, people of America, the dark world is on the move! It wants and will have Freedom, Autonomy and Equality. It will not be diverted in these fundamental rights by dialectical splitting of political hairs ... Whites may, if they will, arm themselves for suicide. But the vast majority of the world&#x27;s peoples will march on over them to freedom!&quot;

In the spring of 1949, he spoke at the World Congress of the Partisans of Peace in Paris, saying to the large crowd: &quot;Leading this new colonial imperialism comes my own native land built by my father&#x27;s toil and blood, the United States. The United States is a great nation; rich by grace of God and prosperous by the hard work of its humblest citizens ... Drunk with power we are leading the world to hell in a new colonialism with the same old human slavery which once ruined us; and to a third World War which will ruin the world.&quot; Du Bois affiliated himself with a leftist organization, the National Council of Arts, Sciences and Professions, and he traveled to Moscow as its representative to speak at the All-Soviet Peace Conference in late 1949.

During this period, Du Bois also visited the remains of the Warsaw Ghetto, an experience he spoke about in a speech titled, &quot;The Negro and the Warsaw Ghetto&quot; delivered in 1949 and later published in 1952 in the magazine &quot;Jewish Life.&quot; In the address, Du Bois reflects on the destruction caused by the Nazi assault against Jewish peoples and considers the way in which the &quot;race problem&quot; could extend past a &quot;color-line&quot; and become &quot;a matter of cultural patterns, perverted teaching and human hate and prejudice, which reached all sorts of people and caused endless evil to all men&quot;. Du Bois&#x27; speech champions a broader and more transnational approach to humanitarianism.

===The FBI, McCarthyism, and trial===

During the 1950s, the U.S. government&#x27;s anti-communist McCarthyism campaign targeted Du Bois because of his socialist leanings. Socialist historian Manning Marable characterizes the government&#x27;s treatment of Du Bois as &quot;ruthless repression&quot; and a &quot;political assassination&quot;.

The FBI began to compile a file on Du Bois in 1942, investigating him for possible subversive activities. The original investigation appears to have ended in 1943 because the FBI was unable to discover sufficient evidence against Du Bois, but the FBI resumed its investigation in 1949, suspecting he was among a group of &quot;Concealed Communists&quot;. The most aggressive government attack against Du Bois occurred in the early 1950s, as a consequence of his opposition to nuclear weapons. In 1950 he became chair of the newly created Peace Information Center (PIC), which worked to publicize the Stockholm Appeal in the United States. The primary purpose of the appeal was to gather signatures on a petition, asking governments around the world to ban all nuclear weapons.

In , the U.S. Justice Department alleged that the PIC was acting as an agent of a foreign state, and thus required the PIC to register with the federal government under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Du Bois and other PIC leaders refused, and they were indicted for failure to register. After the indictment, some of Du Bois&#x27;s associates distanced themselves from him, and the NAACP refused to issue a statement of support; but many labor figures and leftists – including Langston Hughes – supported Du Bois.

He was finally tried in 1951 and was represented by civil rights attorney Vito Marcantonio. The case was dismissed when the defense attorney told the judge that &quot;Dr. Albert Einstein has offered to appear as character witness for Dr. Du Bois&quot;. Du Bois&#x27;s memoir of the trial is &quot;In Battle for Peace&quot;. Even though Du Bois was not convicted, the government confiscated Du Bois&#x27;s passport and withheld it for eight years.

===Communism===
Du Bois was bitterly disappointed that many of his colleaguesparticularly the NAACPdid not support him during his 1951 PIC trial, whereas working-class whites and blacks supported him enthusiastically. After the trial, Du Bois lived in Manhattan, writing and speaking, and continuing to associate primarily with leftist acquaintances. His primary concern was world peace, and he railed against military actions such as the Korean War, which he viewed as efforts by imperialist whites to maintain colored people in a submissive state.

In 1950, at the age of 82, Du Bois ran for U.S. Senator from New York on the American Labor Party ticket and received about 200,000 votes, or 4% of the statewide total. He continued to believe that capitalism was the primary culprit responsible for the subjugation of colored people around the world, and although he recognized the faults of the Soviet Union, he continued to uphold communism as a possible solution to racial problems. In the words of biographer David Lewis, Du Bois did not endorse communism for its own sake, but did so because &quot;the enemies of his enemies were his friends&quot;. The same ambiguity characterized his opinions of Joseph Stalin: in 1940 he wrote disdainfully of the &quot;Tyrant Stalin&quot;, but when Stalin died in 1953, Du Bois wrote a eulogy characterizing Stalin as &quot;simple, calm, and courageous&quot;, and lauding him for being the &quot;first [to] set Russia on the road to conquer race prejudice and make one nation out of its 140 groups without destroying their individuality&quot;.

The U.S. government prevented Du Bois from attending the 1955 Bandung Conference in Indonesia. The conference was the culmination of 40 years of Du Bois&#x27;s dreams – a meeting of 29 nations from Africa and Asia, many recently independent, representing most of the world&#x27;s colored peoples. The conference celebrated those nations&#x27; independence as they began to assert their power as non-aligned nations during the Cold War. Du Bois praised the conference as &quot;pan-colored&quot; and believed it would have decisive and long-lasting influence.

After the United States Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Kent v. Dulles&quot; that the State Department could not deny passports to citizens who refused to sign affidavits that they were not communists, Du Bois and his wife Shirley Graham Du Bois immediately applied for passports. The two visited both the Soviet Union and China during a 1958 to 1959 trip which Du Bois described as the most significant journey of his life. Du Bois later wrote approvingly of the conditions in both countries. In 1959, Du Bois gave a speech at Peking University in which he advocated for increased ties between the black people in the United States and China because &quot;China is colored and knows to what a colored skin in this modern world subjects its owner.&quot; Du Bois stated that Africa and China should stand together. The speech was reprinted and widely circulated in China, including through the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; and the &quot;Peking Review.&quot;

Du Bois and Graham Du Bois were staying at the border between Sichuan and Tibet when the 1959 Tibetan uprising began. Describing the events in his &quot;Autobiography&quot;, Du Bois concluded, &quot;The landholders and slave drivers and religious fanatics revolted against the Chinese and failed as they deserved to. Tibet has belonged to China for centuries. The Communists linked the two by roads and began reforms in landholding, schools, and trade, which now move quickly.&quot;

Du Bois became incensed in 1961 when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the 1950 McCarran Internal Security Act, a key piece of McCarthyist legislation that required communists to register with the government. To demonstrate his outrage, he joined the Communist Party in October 1961, at the age of 93. Around that time, he wrote: &quot;I believe in communism. I mean by communism, a planned way of life in the production of wealth and work designed for building a state whose object is the highest welfare of its people and not merely the profit of a part.&quot; He asked Herbert Aptheker, a communist and historian of African American history, to be his literary executor. In 1961 he was a sponsor of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

===Death in Africa===
Nkrumah invited Du Bois to the Dominion of Ghana to participate in their independence celebration in 1957, but he was unable to attend because the U.S. government had confiscated his passport in 1951. By 1960the &quot;Year of Africa&quot;Du Bois had recovered his passport and was able to cross the Atlantic and celebrate the creation of the Republic of Ghana. Du Bois returned to Africa in late 1960 to attend the inauguration of Nnamdi Azikiwe as the first African governor of Nigeria.

While visiting Ghana in 1960, Du Bois spoke with its president about the creation of a new encyclopedia of the African diaspora, the &quot;Encyclopedia Africana&quot;. In early 1961, Ghana notified Du Bois that they had appropriated funds to support the encyclopedia project, and they invited him to travel to Ghana and manage the project there. In October 1961, at the age of 93, Du Bois and his wife traveled to Ghana to take up residence and commence work on the encyclopedia. In early 1963, the United States refused to renew his passport, so he made the symbolic gesture of becoming a citizen of Ghana.

The FBI continued to &quot;keep tabs&quot; on Du Bois and Graham Du Bois while they lived in Ghana.

While it is sometimes stated that Du Bois renounced his U.S. citizenship at that time, and he stated his intention to do so, Du Bois never actually did. His health declined during the two years he was in Ghana; he died on August 27, 1963, in the capital, Accra, at the age of 95. The following day, at the March on Washington, speaker Roy Wilkins asked the hundreds of thousands of marchers to honor Du Bois with a moment of silence. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, embodying many of the reforms Du Bois had campaigned for during his entire life, was enacted almost a year after his death.

Du Bois was given a state funeral on August 29–30, 1963, at Nkrumah&#x27;s request, and was buried near the western wall of Christiansborg Castle (now Osu Castle), then the seat of government in Accra. In China, a crowd of 10,000 people stood in silence for three minutes, and major figures including Mao, Zhou Enlai, Soong Ching-Ling, and Guo Moruo sent messages of condolence to Graham Du Bois.

In 1985, another Ghana state ceremony honored Du Bois. With the ashes of Graham Du Bois, who had died in 1977, his body was re-interred at their former home in Accra, which was dedicated the W. E. B. Du Bois Memorial Centre for Pan African Culture in his memory. Du Bois&#x27;s first wife Nina, their son Burghardt, and their daughter Yolande, who died in 1961, were buried in the cemetery of Great Barrington, Massachusetts, his hometown.

==Personal life==

Du Bois was organized and disciplined: his lifelong regimen was to rise at 7:15, work until 5:00, eat dinner, and read a newspaper until 7:00, then read or socialize until he was in bed, invariably before 10:00. He was a meticulous planner, and frequently mapped out his schedules and goals on large pieces of graph paper. Many acquaintances found him to be distant and aloof, and he insisted on being addressed as &quot;Dr. Du Bois&quot;. According to biographer David Levering, Du Bois would also &quot;unfailingly insist upon the &#x27;correct&#x27; pronunciation of his surname. &#x27;The pronunciation of my name is &quot;Due Boyss&quot;, with the accent on the last syllable,&#x27; he would patiently explain to the uninformed.&quot; Although he was not gregarious, he formed several close friendships with associates such as Charles Young, Paul Laurence Dunbar, John Hope, Mary White Ovington, and Albert Einstein.

His closest friend was Joel Spingarn – a white man – but Du Bois never accepted Spingarn&#x27;s offer to be on a first-name basis. Du Bois was something of a dandy – he dressed formally, carried a walking stick, and walked with an air of confidence and dignity. He was relatively short, standing at , and always maintained a well-groomed mustache and goatee. He enjoyed singing and playing tennis.

Du Bois married Nina Gomer (b. about 1870, m. 1896, d. 1950), with whom he had two children. Their son Burghardt died as an infant before their second child, daughter Yolande, was born. Yolande attended Fisk University and became a high school teacher in Baltimore. Her father encouraged her marriage to Countee Cullen, a nationally known poet of the Harlem Renaissance. They divorced within two years. She married again and had a daughter, Du Bois&#x27;s only grandchild. That marriage also ended in divorce.

As a widower, Du Bois married Shirley Graham (m. 1951, d. 1977), an author, playwright, composer, and activist. She brought her son David Graham to the marriage. David grew close to Du Bois and took his stepfather&#x27;s name; he also worked for African-American causes. The historian David Levering Lewis wrote that Du Bois engaged in several extramarital relationships.

===Religion===
Although Du Bois attended a New England Congregational church as a child, he abandoned organized religion while at Fisk College. As an adult, Du Bois described himself as agnostic and a freethinker, with one biographer concluding that Du Bois was virtually an atheist. Some analysts place Du Bois&#x27; &quot;religious voice&quot; alongside irreligious black thinkers such as Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston, and James Baldwin.

When asked to lead public prayers, Du Bois would refuse. In his 1968 autobiography, Du Bois wrote:

Du Bois was a critic of religion in general, and American churches in particular, whom he characterised as being the most discriminatory of all institutions on Earth. He also provocatively linked African American Christianity to indigenous African religions. and characterized the practice of allowing children to learn &quot;so-called religious [truths]&quot;, which they will later recognise as false, as a &quot;moral disaster&quot;. While he did acknowledge the beneficial role that black Christianity religion as a &quot;basic rock&quot; and &quot;anchor&quot; for African American communities, he mainly disparaged African American churches and clergy because he felt they did not adequately support the goals of racial equality and otherwise hindered activists&#x27; efforts. 

Although Du Bois did not have any religious beliefs, he writings were influenced by his reading of religious texts and frequently used religious symbology for its rhetorical effect and persuasive power. Many contemporaries viewed him as a &quot;prophet&quot; of African-American liberation. His 1904 prose poem, &quot;Credo&quot;, was written in the style of a religious creed and widely read by the African-American community. Moreover, Du Bois, both in his own fiction and in stories published in &quot;The Crisis&quot;, often drew analogies between the lynchings of African Americans and the crucifixion of Jesus. Between 1920 and 1940, Du Bois shifted from overt black messiah symbolism to more subtle messianic language.

===Voting===
In 1889, Du Bois became eligible to vote at the age of 21. During his life he followed the philosophy of voting for third parties if the Democratic and Republican parties were unsatisfactory; or voting for the lesser of two evils if a third option was not available.

Du Bois endorsed the Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan in the 1908 presidential election. In the 1912 presidential election, Du Bois supported Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic nominee, as he believed Wilson was a &quot;liberal Southerner&quot; although he had wanted to support Theodore Roosevelt and the Progressive Party, but the Progressives ignored issues facing black people. He later regretted his decision, as he came to the conclusion that Wilson was opposed to racial equality. During the 1916 presidential election he supported Charles Evans Hughes, the Republican nominee, as he believed that Wilson was the greater evil. During the 1920 presidential election he supported Warren G. Harding, the Republican nominee, as Harding promised to end the United States occupation of Haiti. During the 1924 presidential election he supported Robert M. La Follette, the Progressive nominee, although he believed that La Follette could not win. During the 1928 presidential election he believed that both Herbert Hoover and Al Smith insulted black voters, and instead Du Bois supported Norman Thomas, the Socialist nominee.

From 1932 to 1944, Du Bois supported Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic nominee, as Roosevelt&#x27;s attitude towards workers was more realistic. During the 1948 presidential election he supported Henry A. Wallace, the Progressive nominee, and supported the Progressives&#x27; nominee, Vincent Hallinan, again in 1952.

During the 1956 presidential election Du Bois stated that he would not vote. He criticized the foreign, taxation, and crime policies of the Eisenhower administration and Adlai Stevenson II for promising to maintain those policies. However, he could not vote third party due to the lack of ballot access for the Socialist Party.

<text>Taligent Inc. (a portmanteau of &quot;talent&quot; and &quot;intelligent&quot;) was an American software company. Based on the Pink object-oriented operating system conceived by Apple in 1988, Taligent Inc. was incorporated as an Apple/IBM partnership in 1992, and was dissolved into IBM in 1998.

In 1988, after launching System 6 and MultiFinder, Apple initiated the exploratory project named Pink to design the next generation of the classic Mac OS. Though diverging from Macintosh into a sprawling new dream system, Pink was wildly successful within Apple. Though having no releases until 1995, it was a subject of industry hype for years. In 1992, the new AIM alliance spawned an Apple/IBM partnership corporation named Taligent Inc., with the purpose of bringing Pink to market. In 1994, Hewlett-Packard joined the partnership with a 15% stake. After a two-year series of goal-shifting delays, Taligent OS was eventually canceled, but the CommonPoint application framework was launched in 1995 for AIX with a later beta for OS/2. CommonPoint was technologically acclaimed but had an extremely complex learning curve, so sales were very low.

Taligent OS and CommonPoint mirrored the sprawling scope of IBM&#x27;s complementary Workplace OS, in redundantly overlapping attempts to become the ultimate universal system to unify all of the world&#x27;s computers and operating systems with a single microkernel. From 1993 to 1996, Taligent was seen as competing with Microsoft Cairo and NeXTSTEP, even though Taligent did not ship a product until 1995 and Cairo never shipped at all. From 1994 to 1996, Apple floated the Copland operating system project intended to succeed System 7, but never had a modern OS sophisticated enough to run Taligent technology.

In 1995, Apple and HP withdrew from the Taligent partnership, licensed its technology, and left it as a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM. In January 1998, Taligent Inc. was finally dissolved into IBM. Taligent&#x27;s legacy became the unbundling of CommonPoint&#x27;s best compiler and application components and converting them into VisualAge C++ and the globally adopted Java Development Kit 1.1 (especially internationalization).

In 1997, Apple instead bought NeXT and began synthesizing the classic Mac OS with the NeXTSTEP operating system. Mac OS X was launched on March 24, 2001, as the future of the Macintosh and eventually the iPhone. In the late 2010s, some of Apple&#x27;s personnel and design concepts from Pink and from Purple (the first iPhone&#x27;s codename) would resurface and blend into Google&#x27;s Fuchsia operating system.

Along with Workplace OS, Copland, and Cairo, Taligent is cited as a death march project of the 1990s, suffering from development hell as a result of feature creep and the second-system effect.

==History==

===Development===

The entire history of Pink and Taligent from 1988 to 1998 is that of a widely admired, anticipated, and theoretically competitive staff and its system, but is also overall defined by development hell, second-system effect, empire building, secrecy, and vaporware.

==== Pink team ====

Apple&#x27;s cofounders Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs had departed the company in 1985. This vacuum of entrepreneurial leadership created a tendency to promote low-level engineers up to management and allowed increasingly redundant groups of engineers to compete and co-lead by consensus, and to manifest their own bottom-up corporate culture. In 1988, Apple released System 6, a major release of the flagship Macintosh operating system, to a lackluster reception. The system&#x27;s architectural limits, set forth by the tight hardware constraints of its original 1984 release, now demanded increasingly ingenious workarounds for incremental gains such as MultiFinder&#x27;s cooperative multitasking, while still lacking memory protection and virtual memory. Having committed these engineering triumphs which were often blunted within such a notoriously fragile operating system, a restless group of accomplished senior engineers were nicknamed the Gang of Five: Erich Ringewald, David Goldsmith, Bayles Holt, Gene Pope, and Gerard Schutten. The Gang gave an ultimatum that they should either be allowed to break from their disliked management and take the entrepreneurial and engineering risks needed to develop the next generation of the Macintosh operating system, or else leave the company.

In March 1988, the Gang, their management, and software manager and future Taligent CTO Mike Potel, met at the Sonoma Mission Inn and Spa. To roadmap the future of the operating system and thus of the organizational chart, ideas were written on colored index cards and pinned to a wall. Ideas that were incremental updates to the existing system were written on blue colored cards, those that were more technologically advanced or long-term were written on pink cards, and yet more radical ideas were on red cards because they &quot;would be pinker than Pink&quot;. The Blue group would receive the Gang&#x27;s former management duo, along with incremental improvements in speed, RAM size, and hard drive size. Pink would receive the Gang, with Erich Ringewald as technical lead, plus preemptive multitasking and a componentized application design. Red would receive speech recognition and voice commands, thought to be as futuristic as the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction series.

Erich Ringewald led the Gang of Five as the new Pink group, located one floor below the Apple software headquarters in the De Anza 3 building, to begin a feasibility study with a goal of product launch in two years. Remembering the small but powerful original Macintosh group, he maintained secrecy and avoided the micromanagement of neighboring senior executives, by immediately relocating his quintet off the main Apple campus. They used the nondescript Bubb Road warehouse which was already occupied by the secretly sophisticated Newton project. Pink briefly garnered an additional code name, &quot;Defiant&quot;.

==== Pink system ====
The Pink team was faced with the two possible architectural directions of either using legacy System 6 code or starting from scratch. Having just delivered the System 6 overhaul in the form of MultiFinder, Ringewald was adamant that Pink&#x27;s intense ambitions were deliverable within a realistic two year timeframe only if the team heavily improved its legacy compatibility code. He pragmatically warned them, &quot;We&#x27;re going to have enough trouble just reimplementing the Mac.&quot; In Apple&#x27;s contentious corporate culture of consensus, this mandate was soon challenged; David Goldsmith resigned from Pink after making a counter-ultimatum for a complete redesign which obviates all legacy problems, and some other staff escalated their complaints to upward management in agreement with that. Months later, a senior executive finally overrode Ringewald, thus redeveloping Pink from scratch as a new and unique system with no System 6 legacy.

The Pink team numbered eleven when the six-person kernel team within Apple&#x27;s Advanced Technology Group (ATG) was merged into Pink to begin designing its new microkernel named Opus. Embellishing upon the pink index cards, Pink&#x27;s overall key design goals were now total object-orientation, memory protection, preemptive multitasking, internationalization, and advanced graphics. Many ideas from the red cards would later be adopted. After its first two months, Pink had a staff of about 25.

By October 1988, the Gang of Five had become only oneBayles Holtbecause Gene Pope, Gerard Schutten, and Erich Ringewald had exited the sprawling Pink project. The former leader held &quot;grave doubts&quot; over the feasibility of this &quot;living, breathing, money-consuming thing&quot; which was &quot;out of control&quot;. Meanwhile, the remaining group and all of Apple were enamored and doubtless of Pink&#x27;s world-changing vision, trying to join its staff of more than 100 by April 1989. It was a flourishing project that drained personnel from various other departments. All groups outside of Blue became defensively secretive in a company-wide culture of empire-building. Pink&#x27;s secretive and ring culture didn&#x27;t share source code or product demonstrations, even with the next generation Jaguar workstation design group, until so ordered by CEO John Sculley, and only then under extreme security and monitoring. Throughout Apple, the project and the system were considered successful, but from April 1989 and on into the 1990s, the running joke had always been and would always be, &quot;When is Pink going to ship? Two years.&quot;

By late 1989, Pink was a functional prototype of a desktop operating system on Macintosh hardware, featuring advanced graphics and dynamic internationalized text. Pink engineer Dave said it was &quot;a real OS that could demonstrate the core technology&quot; much deeper than System 6 could do. In June 1990, Bill Bruffey abandoned the idea of Pink becoming a new Mac OS. He got permission to create yet another new microkernel named NuKernel, intended explicitly for a new Mac OS. His team of six engineers worked a few months to demonstrate a microkernel-based Mac OS on a Macintosh IIci, which would years later become Copland and the proposed Mac OS 8.

In 1990, Pink became the Object Based Systems group with Senior Vice President Ed Birss and a diverse staff of 150, including marketing and secretaries. Meanwhile, the hundreds of personnel in the Blue design group were constrained by the commercial pragmatism of maintaining their billion-dollar legacy operating system, which required them to refuse many new features, which earned them the infamous nickname &quot;Blue Meanies&quot;. This group had well established the evolution of System 6 which would be released in 1991 as System 7. RAM chips and hard drives were extremely expensive so most personal computers were critically resource constrained, and System 7 would already barely fit onto existing Macintosh systems. Pink would therefore be hard-pressed to include backward compatibility for System 7 applications atop itself, assuming the team wanted to do so. This physical and economical constraint is a crucial aspect of the second-system effect.

Pink&#x27;s graphical user interface (GUI) is based on a &quot;faux&quot; 3D motif of isometric icons, beveled edges, non-rectangular windows, and drop shadows. One designer said &quot;The large UI team included interaction and visual designers, and usability specialists.&quot; That essential visual design language would be an influence for several years into Copland, Mac OS 8, and CommonPoint. Magazines throughout the early 1990s showed various mock-ups of what Pink could look like. The People, Places, and Things metaphor extends beyond the traditional desktop metaphor and provides the user with GUI tools to easily drag documents between people and things, such as fax machines and printers. The component-based document model is similar to what would become OpenDoc. In mid-1991, Apple CEO John Sculley bragged that Apple had written 1.5 million lines of code for Pink. An IBM engineer described the first impression of this sophisticated prototype in 1991:

====AIM alliance====
On October 2, 1991, the historic AIM alliance was formed and announced by Apple, IBM, and Motorola. It was conceived to cross-pollinate Apple&#x27;s personal products and IBM&#x27;s enterprise products, to better confront Microsoft&#x27;s monopoly, and to design a new grandly unified platform for the computing industry. This alliance spun off two partner corporations: Kaleida Labs to develop multimedia software, and Taligent Inc. to bring Pink to market sometime in the mid-90s.

Pink was a massive draw for this alliance, where Apple had been initially approached by two different parts of IBM. One IBM group sought customers for its new POWER CPU hardware, therefore discovering Pink and a new desire to port it to this hardware. The other IBM group sought third party interest in its Grand Unifying Theory of Systems (GUTS) as the solution to the deeply endemic crisis that is software development, which would soon result in Workplace OS. In an April 12, 1991, demonstration of Pink and its architecture, IBM was profoundly impressed and its GUTS outline was immediately impacted. By 1993, IBM&#x27;s ambitious global roadmap would include the unification of the diverse world of computing by converting Pink to become one of many personalities of Workplace OS, and the ending of the need to write new major applications by instead making smaller additions to Pink&#x27;s generalized frameworks.

Even before the signing of the alliance contract, the very existence of Pink was identified as a potential second-system threat if its revolutionary aura could prompt customers to delay their adoption of OS/2.

====Taligent Inc.====
On March 2, 1992, Taligent Inc. was launched as the first product of the AIM alliance. Moving from a temporary lease at Apple headquarters to an office down the street in Cupertino, the company launched with 170 employees, most of whom had been re-hired directly from Apple plus CEO Joe Guglielmi. At age 50, he was a 30-year marketing veteran of IBM and former leader of the OS/2 platform up to its soon-launched version 2.0. The company&#x27;s mission was to bring Pink to market.

=====Culture and purpose=====
Enthusiastically dismissing industry skepticism, he said Taligent would form its own corporate culture, independent of the established cultures and potential failures of its two founding investors and future customers, Apple and IBM. The two were recent allies carrying five other joint initiatives, and a deep rivalry of more than a decade. &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot; reflected, &quot;It was fairly surreal for the Apple and IBM employees who went to Taligent and found themselves working for bosses still loyal to the opposition. Not a typical Silicon Valley career move, maybe, but perhaps a portent of other weird twists to come. Ignoring the politics as much as possible, the Taligent programmers buckled down and wrote a lotta lines of code.&quot; Commenting on the corporate culture shock of combining free-spirited Apple and formal IBM personnel, &quot;Fortune&quot; compared the company&#x27;s cultural engineering challenge as possibly exceeding its software engineering challenge. The openminded but sensible CEO reined it in, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m tired of [Apple] folklore ... I want some data.&quot; Comparing the eager startup Taligent to its billion dollar investors, a leader at Kaleida said &quot;The culture of IBM and Apple is largely about getting more benefits, perks, larger offices, fancier computers, and more employees&quot;. &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot; would describe the increased abstraction in corporate culture resulting from Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s upcoming 1994 addition to the partnership: &quot;Now you could be [a former] Apple programmer working for [a former] IBM boss who reported [externally] to HP. Or some combination thereof. Twisteder and twisteder.&quot;

Apple and IBM did share a progressive culture of object orientation, as seen in their deep portfolios since the early 1980s. IBM had delivered objects on System/38 and AS/400, partnered with Patriot Partners, and integrated System Object Model (SOM) and Distributed SOM into OS/2 and AIX. Apple had already delivered Lisa, prototyped the fully object-oriented Pink operating system, and delivered object oriented frameworks using MacApp. Both companies had worked with Smalltalk.

Within one month of its founding, there was immediate industry-wide confusion about Taligent&#x27;s purpose and scope. An industry analyst said &quot;IBM and Apple blew it ... they should have announced everything [about Taligent] or nothing.&quot; Especially regarding Taligent&#x27;s potential relationship to the Macintosh, Apple reiterated that its existing flagship legacy would continue indefinitely with System 7 and Macintosh hardware. COO Michael Spindler said &quot;The Mac is not dead&quot; and others said that they had never claimed that Pink would supersede the Macintosh. Charles Oppenheimer, Director of Marketing for Macintosh system software, said &quot;We can&#x27;t say for sure how [the two] will fit together.&quot; The industry was further confused as to the very existence of any Taligent software, not realizing that it was already beyond the concept stage and in fact consisted of volumes of Pink-based software in development by Apple for years. One year later in February 1993, &quot;Wired&quot; magazine would assert its suspicion that Apple and IBM&#x27;s core messengers are maintaining &quot;the big lie&quot;—that Taligent&#x27;s technology is merely a concept, has no existing software, and is actually years away from production—in order to protect their established multi-billion-dollar core legacy of Macintosh and OS/2 products from a potentially superior replacement and to divert the second-system effect.

Upon its launch, CEO Joe Guglielmi soon organized the company into three divisions: a native system group for its self-hosted Pink OS, a development tools group, and a complementary products group for application frameworks to be ported to other OSes.

Taligent spent much of its first two years developing its operating system and simultaneously trying to find a market for it. They started a large project surveying potential customers, only to find little interest in a new OS. It is a point of controversy whether the lack of interest was real or the survey fell prey to question-framing problems and political issues with investors. If asked the question &quot;Do you want a new OS?&quot;, there were few who would say yes. The survey did, however, show there was sufficient support for the benefits TalOS would bring.

=====Technology=====
The Pink operating system is now formally named Taligent Object Services (TOS or TalOS) whether hosted natively on its microkernel or non-natively on a third party OS, but the nickname &quot;Pink&quot; will always remain industry lore, such as with the developer phone number 408-TO-B-PINK. The entire graphics subsystem is 3D, including the 2D portions which are actually 3D constructs. It is based extensively on object-oriented frameworks from the kernel upward, including device drivers, the Taligent input/output (I/O) system, and ensembles. By 1993, IBM discussed decoupling most of TalOS away from its native Opus microkernel, and retargeting most of TalOS onto the IBM Microkernel which was already used as the base for IBM&#x27;s tandem project, Workplace OS. Its text handling and localization via Unicode was intended to begin enabling the globalization of software development, especially in simplifying Japanese.

In January 1993, Taligent&#x27;s VP of Marketing said the strong progress of native TalOS development could encourage its early incremental release prior to the full 1995 schedule for TalAE. Apple&#x27;s business manager to Taligent Chris Espinosa acknowledged the irony of Apple and IBM building competing Taligent-based platforms, which had originated at Apple as Pink. He forecast Apple&#x27;s adoption of Taligent components into the irreplaceably personal Mac OSwhile empowering its competitiveness with IBM&#x27;s future Taligent-based general purpose systems, and easing corporate users&#x27; migration toward Apple&#x27;s Enterprise Systems Division&#x27;s future Taligent-based computers.

On January 10, 1993, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported on the state of Taligent, saying the company and its platform had the broad optimistic support of Borland, WordPerfect, and Novell. Borland CEO Philippe Kahn said &quot;Technically, [Pink] is brilliant, and Taligent is running much faster than I expected.&quot; A software venture capitalist expected new entrepreneurs to appreciate the platform&#x27;s newness and lack of legacy baggage, and the industry expected Apple loyalists to embrace a new culture. Regardless of genuine merit, many in the industry reportedly expected Taligent&#x27;s success to depend upon wounding Microsoft&#x27;s monopoly. On January 18, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; reported, &quot;Taligent draws rave reviews from software developers&quot;.

By April 1993, Taligent, Inc. had grown to about 260 employees, mostly from Apple or &quot;some other loose Silicon Valley culture&quot;. &quot;MacWEEK&quot; reported that the company remained on schedule or ahead through 1993 into 1994.

On June 23, 1993, Apple preannounced MacApp&#x27;s direct successor, the new object-oriented crossplatform SDK codenamed Bedrock. Positioned as &quot;the most direct path for migration&quot; from System 7 to Pink, it was intended to provide source code compatibility between System 7, Windows 3.1, Windows NT, OS/2, and Pink. Bedrock would be abruptly discontinued 18 months later with no successor, and leaving Apple with no connection between System 7 and Pink.
By 1994, the platform consisted of Taligent Object Services (TOS or TalOS), Taligent Application Environment (TAE or TalAE), and the Taligent Development System (TDS or TalDS). The initial plan was to deploy TalAE in early 1994 to help seed the market with a base of applications for TalOS, which was intended to be launched in 1995, with the whole platform going mainstream in two to five years—surely expecting a modern OS from Apple by 1994 or 1995. Influenced by the results of the survey effort, CEO Joe Guglielmi acknowledged the unavoidable risk of creating its own second-system effect, if the TalAE enhancements could make third party operating systems into competitors of native TalOS. The first internal development environment was an IBM RS/6000 model 250 with a PowerPC 601 CPU running AIX, building TalOS natively for the 68k Macintosh.

=====HP, CommonPoint beta=====

In January 1994, fellow object technology pioneer Hewlett-Packard joined Apple and IBM as the third co-owner of Taligent at 15% holding. HP held deeply vested experience in object technology since the 1980s with the NewWave desktop environment, the Softbench IDE, Distributed Smalltalk, Distributed Object Management Facility (DOMF), and having cofounded the Object Management Group. Taligent&#x27;s object oriented portfolio was broadened with HP&#x27;s compilers, DOMF, and intention to integrate TalOS and TalAE into HP-UX. HP had already partnered with Taligent&#x27;s well-established competitor NeXT to integrate OpenStep into HP-UX, and Taligent had pursued partnerships with both Sun and HP for several months, all serving to improve HP&#x27;s competitive bargaining in its offer to Taligent. A Taligent engineer reportedly said, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t that HP was driven by OpenStep to go to Taligent, but that OpenStep allowed them to make a much better deal.&quot; &quot;NeXTWORLD&quot; summarized that &quot;[HP covered] all bets in the race for the object market&quot;, and Sun CEO Scott McNealy derided the partnership as HP being Taligent&#x27;s &quot;trophy spouse&quot;. &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot; quipped: &quot;Now you could be [a former] Apple programmer working for [a former] IBM boss who reported [externally] to HP. Or some combination thereof. Twisteder and twisteder.&quot;

By March 1994, Taligent had reportedly begun shipping code to its three investors, and some parts of TalAE had shipped to developers though without source code by policy. The first public Taligent technology demonstration was at SFA in Atlanta as an &quot;amazingly fast&quot; and crash-tolerant five-threaded 3D graphics application on native TalOS on a Macintosh IIci. Also in March 1994 at the PC Forum conference, Taligent gave the first public demonstration of TalAE applications, to an impressed but hesitant reception. A show of hands indicated one out of approximately 500 attendees were actively developing on TalAE, but Taligent reported 60 members in its future second wave of developer program. The frameworks already present allowed the integration of advanced TalAE features into pre-existing platform-native applications. CEO Joe Guglielmi reported on TalAE gaining the ongoing outside interest of IBM, but suffering relative uninvolvement from Applepossibly due to Apple&#x27;s failure to deliver a mainstream OS capable of running it. On April 18, 1994, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; reported Taligent&#x27;s future plans for its SDK to be distributed. In November 1994 at Comdex, the public debut of third-party TalAE applications was on an RS/6000 running AIX to demonstrate prototypes made by seven vendors.

In late 1994, TalAE was renamed to CommonPoint, TalDE was renamed to cpProfessional, and Taligent User Interface Builder was renamed to cpConstructor. CommonPoint was being beta tested at 100 sites, with an initial target market of internal corporate developers. TalOS was still scheduled to ship in 1996. Apple considered MacApp&#x27;s lifespan to have &quot;run its course&quot; as the primary Macintosh SDK, while Taligent considered MacApp to be prerequisite experience for its own platform. Meanwhile, Apple and CILabs had begun an internal mandate for all new development to be based on the complementary and already published OpenDoc. CILabs was committed to publishing its source code, while Taligent was committed against publishing its own.
Taligent was now considered to be a venerable competitor in the desktop operating system and enterprise object markets even without any product release, and being late. John C. Dvorak described Taligent as a threat in the desktop market of integrated application suites, particularly to the &quot;spooked&quot; Microsoft which responded with many vaporware product announcements (such as Chicago, Cairo, Daytona, and Snowball) to distract the market&#x27;s attention from Taligent. &quot;ComputerWorld&quot; described the enterprise computing market as shifting away from monolithic and procedural application models and even application suites, toward object-oriented component-based application frameworks, all in Taligent&#x27;s favor. Its theoretical newness was often compared to NeXT&#x27;s older but mature and commercially established platform. Sun Microsystems held exploratory meetings with Taligent before deciding upon building out its object application framework OpenStep in partnership with NeXT as a &quot;preemptive move against Taligent and [Microsoft&#x27;s] Cairo&quot;. Having given up on seeing Pink go to market soon, Apple publicly announced Copland in March 1994 intended to compete with the upcoming Windows 95.

Apple was and will remain the only vendor of a desired target OS which is physically incapable of receiving Taligent&#x27;s heavy payload due to System 7&#x27;s critical lack of modern features such as preemptive multitasking. However, Taligent reportedly remains so committed to boosting the industry&#x27;s confidence in Apple&#x27;s modernization that it is considering creating a way to hybridize TalOS applications for the nascent System 7, and Apple reportedly intends for the upcoming Power Macintosh to boot native TalOS as a next-generation alternative to System 7. The second-system effect is uniquely intensified because Apple is beginning to view the architecturally superior TalOS as a competitor against the protractedly weak System 7 which has no successor in sight. &quot;InfoWorld&quot; reported this: &quot;Developers and analysts also said that Taligent&#x27;s fate is closely tied to that of OS/2 and the other as-yet-undelivered operating systems that it is designed to run on top of.&quot; This included Apple, Windows NT, and the yet unreleased Windows 95. A 1994 detailed report by INPUT assesses that Taligent&#x27;s &quot;very risky&quot; future will depend not on its technology, but on support from IBM and major developers, the rapid and cheap development of applications and complex integration tasks, and the ability to create new markets.

In June 1994, Taligent shipped its first deliverable, considered to be somewhat late for its three investors and approximately 100 developer companies. It is a prebeta developer preview called the Partners Early Experience Kit (PEEK), consisting of 80 frameworks for AIX and OS/2. It received mixed reviews, with &quot;InfoWorld&quot; saying it is &quot;inhibited by a massive footprint, a shortage of development tools, and a mind-boggling complexity&quot;. TalDE was scheduled to ship in Q2 1995.

At this point, Apple was reportedly &quot;hedging its bets&quot; in formulating a strategy to deliver the second-system TalAE, while remaining primarily devout to System 7. The company intended to soon introduce the PowerOpen platform of PowerPC AIX, which would deliver TalAE for running a hopefully forthcoming class of applications, simultaneously alongside Macintosh Application Services for running legacy System 7 personal applications.

In May 1995, Taligent canceled the delayed release of its natively hosted TalOS, to focus on its TalAE application framework programming environment that would run on any modern operating system. Having been developed mainly upon AIX, the plan was to port TalAE to HP-UX, OS/2, Windows NT, and Copland. Those vendors are intended to port and bundle TalAE directly with their operating systems, and Taligent will port for those who don&#x27;t.

=====CommonPoint=====
Taligent said that it wants CommonPoint to be the definitive software industry standard, like a local app store in every computer. &quot;Shake n bake&quot; application development in four steps. Each app would have minimal package delivery size because customers already have most of the code in the form of the shared CommonPoint framework. The CommonPoint frameworks are divided into three categories: Application, Domain, and Support.

On July 28, 1995, Taligent shipped its first final product, CommonPoint 1.1, after seven years in development as Pink and then TalAE. First released only for its reference platform of AIX, it was initially priced at for only the runtime framework for users; or for the runtime framework and the software development kit, which further requires the Cset++ compiler because TalDE is still scheduled for a later release. The runtime has an overhead of for each machine and total system RAM is recommended. Though essentially on schedule by the company&#x27;s own PEEK projections last year, some analysts considered it to be &quot;too little, too late&quot; especially compared to the maturely established NeXT platform. Several PEEK beta test sites and final release customers were very pleased with the platform, though disappointed in the marked lack of crossplatform presence on HP/UX, Mac OS, and Windows NT which strictly limited any adoption of CommonPoint even among enthusiasts. Hewlett-Packard wrote a beginner&#x27;s guide for CommonPoint programmers to address its steep learning curve, saying that its survey showed that experienced C++ framework programmers needed at least three months to even approach their first application. At its launch, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; told CEO Joe Guglielmi that &quot;corporate users don&#x27;t generally understand what CommonPoint is for&quot; and have trouble differentiating CommonPoint and OpenDoc. IBM reportedly conducted a &quot;full-court press&quot; to analyze and promote customers&#x27; awareness of CommonPoint, by training its direct sales and consulting staff, attending industry conferences to make CommonPoint presentations, and &quot;talking with any third-party software vendor and systems integrator who will listen&quot;.

The CommonPoint beta for OS/2 was released on December 15, 1995. This was coincidentally the same day as the gold master of the Workplace OS final beta, IBM&#x27;s complementary cousin operating system to TalOS. The final beta of Workplace OS was released on January 5, 1996, in the form of OS/2 Warp Connect (PowerPC Edition) and then immediately discontinued without ever receiving a release of CommonPoint.

Meanwhile, at Apple, the one-year-old Copland reached a primitive and notoriously unstable developer preview release, and Apple&#x27;s frustrated lack of operating system strategy still had not shipped anything physically capable of running any Taligent software.

=====New leadership=====
By 1995, it was estimated that the three investors had spent more than $100 million on Taligent, Inc., with its closure being predicted by sources of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; due to the decline of its parent companies and due to the inherent difficulty of anyone in the IT industry remaining committed beyond 18 months.

In September 1995, CEO Joe Guglielmi unexpectedly exited Taligent to become VP of Motorola, intensifying the industry&#x27;s concerns. Dick Gurino, a general manager of a PC and software development division at IBM, was named the interim CEO and tasked with searching for a permanent CEO. In October 1995, Gurino died of a heart attack while jogging, leaving the company without a CEO. On December 19, 1995, founding Taligent employee and Apple veteran Debbie Coutant was promoted to CEO.

On that same day it received what would be its final CEO, Taligent Inc. also ended its partnership form. Apple and HP sold out their holdings in the company, making Taligent Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM alone. While dissolving the partnership, each of the three former partners expressed approval of Taligent&#x27;s progress. In what they called overall enterprise-wide cost-cutting processes, Apple and HP wanted to simply maintain technology licenses, IBM wanted to use its own redundant marketing and support departments, and Taligent wanted to focus only on technology. In the process, nearly 200 of the 375 employees were laid off, leaving only engineering staff. Apple veteran and Taligent cofounding employee, Mike Potel, was promoted from VP of Technology to CTO, saying, &quot;We&#x27;re better protected inside the IBM world than we would be trying to duke it out as an independent company that has to pay its bills every day.&quot;

In November 1996, the final public demonstration of the complete native TalOS was given, titled &quot;The Cutting Edge Scenario&quot;. While referring to the original codename of &quot;Pink&quot;, Taligent had already officially abandoned the never-published native TalOS in favor of CommonPoint.
=====Unbundling=====
In 1997, Taligent&#x27;s mission as an IBM subsidiary was to unbundle the technology of CommonPoint, and to redistribute it across IBM&#x27;s existing products or license it to other companiesall with a special overall focus on Java. On September 1, 1997, &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot; observed, &quot;I guess it&#x27;s easier to develop hot technology when the guys before you have already written most of it. Like inheriting from a rich uncle. And having another rich uncle to sell it for you doesn&#x27;t hurt, either.&quot;

The wider mass market debut of CommonPoint technology was in the form of VisualAge C++ 3.5 for Windows, with the bundling of the Compound Document Framework to handle OLE objects. In February 1997, the first comprehensive shipment of CommonPoint technology was its adoption into IBM&#x27;s well-established VisualAge for C++ 4.0, which &quot;PC Magazine&quot; said was &quot;unmatched&quot; in &quot;sheer breadth of features&quot; because &quot;Now, the best of the CommonPoint technology is being channeled into Open Class for VisualAge.&quot; This bundled SDK adaptation includes several CommonPoint frameworks: desktop (infrastructure for building unified OCX or OpenDoc components); web (called WebRunner, for making drag-and-drop compound documents for the web, and server CGIs); graphics for building 2D GUI apps; international text for Unicode and localization; filesystems; printing; and unit tests. Through 1997, Taligent was at the core of IBM&#x27;s companywide shift to a Java-based middleware strategy. Taligent provided all Unicode internationalization support for Sun&#x27;s 1997 release of Java Development Kit 1.1 through 1.1.4. Taligent was still leasing the same building from Apple, and JavaSoft was located across the street. But its parent IBM, and the related Lotus, were located on the east coast and were not fully aware of Taligent&#x27;s plans and deliverables.

WebRunner is a set of Java- and JavaBeans-based development tools at $149. In June 1997, Places for Project Teams was launched at $49 per user as a groupware GUI which hides the ugly interface of Lotus Notes. Taligent had several products, licenses, trademarks, and patents.

Apple canceled the unstable and unfinished Copland project in August 1996, which had already been presumptively renamed &quot;Mac OS 8&quot;, again leaving only a System 7 legacy. Apple&#x27;s own book &quot;Mac OS 8 Revealed&quot; (1996) had been the definitive final roadmap for Copland, naming the platform&#x27;s competitors and allies, and yet its 336 pages contain no mention of Pink or Taligent. In late 1996, Apple was ever more desperately scrambling to find any operating system strategy whatsoever beyond System 7, even after having already planned its upcoming announcement of it to be made in December 1997. The company had failed to deliver even a functional developer preview of Copland in two years; and it discarded the successful A/UX and PowerOpen platforms in 1995, and the new AIX-based Apple Network Server of 1996–1997. To build the future Mac OS, the company seriously explored licensing other third party OSes such as Solaris, Windows NT, and TalOS.

=====Dissolution=====
On September 16, 1997, IBM announced that Taligent Inc. would be dissolved by the end of the year, with its approximately 100 software engineers being &quot;offered positions at IBM&#x27;s Santa Teresa Laboratory to work on key components for IBM&#x27;s VisualAge for Java programming tools, and at the recently announced Java porting center that IBM is setting up with Sun Microsystems and Netscape&quot;. IBM withdrew CommonPoint for OS/2 from the market on August 3, 1999.

==Reception==
By 1993, one year after incorporation and two years before shipping its first product, Taligent was nonetheless seen as a significant competitor in the industry. &quot;UnixWorld&quot; said that &quot;NeXT needs to increase its volume three-fold [over its existing 50,000 installations] in order to build enough momentum to forestall Microsoft and Taligent in the object-oriented software business.&quot;

In 1994, several PEEK beta test sites were impressed with CommonPoint, including one production success story at American Express which replaced its existing six month legacy application in only six weeks. At first in 1994, they had said &quot;We are almost overwhelmed by the complexity of [CommonPoint]. I don&#x27;t know if the typical corporate developer is going to be able to assimilate this in their shop.&quot; but in 1995 they concluded the project with, &quot;The CommonPoint frameworksand I&#x27;m not exaggeratingare brilliant in the way they cover the technical issues [of that project].&quot; Others were disappointed in the marked lack of crossplatform presence on HP/UX, Mac OS, and Windows NT which strictly limited any adoption of CommonPoint even among enthusiasts.

In March 1995, &quot;IEEE Software&quot; magazine said &quot;Taligent&#x27;s very nature could change the contour of the application landscape. ... [I]t&#x27;s clear that Taligent is sitting on, using, and refining what is ostensibly the world&#x27;s best developed, comprehensive, object-oriented development and system environment.&quot; The system was described as virtually &quot;a whole OS of nothing but hooks&quot;which rests upon, integrates deeply with, and &quot;replaces the host&#x27;s original operating system&quot;, leaving &quot;no lowest common denominator&quot;. Therefore, any Taligent native application is expected to run just the same on any supported host OS. Any degree of clean portability, especially with native integration, in the software industry was described as a holy grail to which many aspire and few deliver, citing the fact that Microsoft Word 6.0 for Macintosh still works like a foreign Windows application because the foundation was redundantly ported with each application. In February 1997, at the first comprehensive mass release of Taligent technology in the form of VisualAge C++ 4.0, &quot;PC Magazine&quot; said &quot;Now, the best of the CommonPoint technology is being channeled into Open Class for VisualAge. ... Although the technology was lauded by many, the size and complexity of the CommonPoint frameworks proved too daunting for practical purposes. ... For sheer breadth of features, the Taligent frameworks are unmatched. An all-encompassing OOP framework has always proved a difficult ideal to realize, but VisualAge&#x27;s Open Class Technology Preview is by far the most credible attempt we&#x27;ve seen.&quot;.

In 2008, &quot;PCWorld&quot; named the native Taligent OS as number 4 of the 15 top vaporware products of all time.

Due to the second-system effect and corporate immune response, &quot;Wired&quot; writer Fred Davis compared Taligent&#x27;s relationship with Apple and IBM to a classic Greek tragedy: &quot;A child is born, destined to kill its father and commit even more unspeakable acts against its mother. The parents love their child and are unwilling to kill it, so they imprison it in a secret dungeon. Despite its mistreatment, the child grows stronger, even more intent on committing its destined crimes.&quot;

In 1995, IT journalist Don Tennant asked Bill Gates to reflect upon &quot;what trend or development over the past 20 years had really caught him by surprise&quot;. Gates responded with what Tennant described as biting, deadpan sarcasm: &quot;Kaleida and Taligent had less impact than we expected.&quot; Tennant believed the explanation to be that &quot;Microsoft&#x27;s worst nightmare is a conjoined Apple and IBM. No other single change in the dynamics of the IT industry could possibly do as much to emasculate Windows.&quot;

==Legacy==
The founding lead engineer of Pink, Erich Ringewald, departed Apple in 1990 to become the lead software architect at Be Inc. and design the new BeOS. Mark Davis, who had previously cofounded the Unicode Consortium, had at Apple co-written WorldScript, Macintosh Script Manager, and headed the localization of Macintosh to Arabic, Hebrew, and Japanese (KanjiTalk), was Taligent&#x27;s Director of Core Technologies and architect of all its internationalization technology, and then became IBM&#x27;s Chief Software Globalization Architect, moved to Google to work on internationalization and Unicode, and now helps to choose the emojis for the world&#x27;s smartphones. Ike Nassi had been VP of Development Tools at Apple, launched MkLinux, served on the boards of Taligent and the OpenDoc Foundation, and worked on the Linksys iPhone.

IBM harvested parts of CommonPoint to create the Open Class libraries for VisualAge for C++, and spawned an open-source project called International Components for Unicode from part of this effort. Resulting from Taligent&#x27;s work led by Mark Davis, IBM published all of the internationalization libraries that are in Java Development Kit 1.1 through 1.1.4 along with source code which was ported to C++ and partially to C. Enhanced versions of some of these classes went into ICU for Java (ICU4J) and ICU for C (ICU4C). The JDK 1.1 received Taligent&#x27;s JavaBeans Migration Assistant for ActiveX, to convert ActiveX into JavaBeans. Davis&#x27;s group became the Unicode group at the IBM Globalization Center of Competency in Cupertino.

Taligent&#x27;s own published software was a set of development tools based on Java and JavaBeans, called WebRunner; and a groupware product based on Lotus Notes called Places for Project Teams. Taligent licensed various technologies to Sun which became an enduring part of Java, and others to Oracle Corporation and Netscape. HP released the Taligent C++ compiler technology (known within Taligent as &quot;CompTech&quot;) as its &quot;ANSI C++&quot; compiler, aCC. HP also released some Taligent graphics libraries.

In the 2010s, some of Apple&#x27;s personnel and design concepts from Pink and Purple (the first iPhone&#x27;s codename) were blended into Google&#x27;s Fuchsia operating system. Based on an object-oriented kernel and application frameworks, its open-source code repository was launched in 2016 with the phrase &quot;Pink + Purple == Fuchsia&quot;.

<text>Bytecode (also called portable code or p-code) is a form of instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter. Unlike human-readable source code, bytecodes are compact numeric codes, constants, and references (normally numeric addresses) that encode the result of compiler parsing and performing semantic analysis of things like type, scope, and nesting depths of program objects.

The name bytecode stems from instruction sets that have one-byte opcodes followed by optional parameters. Intermediate representations such as bytecode may be output by programming language implementations to ease interpretation, or it may be used to reduce hardware and operating system dependence by allowing the same code to run cross-platform, on different devices. Bytecode may often be either directly executed on a virtual machine (a p-code machine, i.e., interpreter), or it may be further compiled into machine code for better performance.

Since bytecode instructions are processed by software, they may be arbitrarily complex, but are nonetheless often akin to traditional hardware instructions: virtual stack machines are the most common, but virtual register machines have been built also. Different parts may often be stored in separate files, similar to object modules, but dynamically loaded during execution.

==Execution==
A bytecode program may be executed by parsing and &quot;directly&quot; executing the instructions, one at a time. This kind of &quot;bytecode interpreter&quot; is very portable. Some systems, called dynamic translators, or &quot;just-in-time&quot; (JIT) compilers, translate bytecode into machine code as necessary at runtime. This makes the virtual machine hardware-specific but does not lose the portability of the bytecode. For example, Java and Smalltalk code is typically stored in bytecode format, which is typically then JIT compiled to translate the bytecode to machine code before execution. This introduces a delay before a program is run, when the bytecode is compiled to native machine code, but improves execution speed considerably compared to interpreting source code directly, normally by around an order of magnitude (10x).

Because of its performance advantage, today many language implementations execute a program in two phases, first compiling the source code into bytecode, and then passing the bytecode to the virtual machine. There are bytecode based virtual machines of this sort for Java, Raku, Python, PHP, Tcl, mawk and Forth (however, Forth is seldom compiled via bytecodes in this way, and its virtual machine is more generic instead). The implementation of Perl and Ruby 1.8 instead work by walking an abstract syntax tree representation derived from the source code.

More recently, the authors of V8 and Dart have challenged the notion that intermediate bytecode is needed for fast and efficient VM implementation. Both of these language implementations currently do direct JIT compiling from source code to machine code with no bytecode intermediary.

==Examples==
*ActionScript executes in the ActionScript Virtual Machine (AVM), which is part of Flash Player and AIR. ActionScript code is typically transformed into bytecode format by a compiler. Examples of compilers include one built into Adobe Flash Professional and one built into Adobe Flash Builder and available in the Adobe Flex SDK.

*EM, the Amsterdam Compiler Kit virtual machine used as an intermediate compiling language and as a modern bytecode language
*Emacs is a text editor with most of its functions implemented by Emacs Lisp, its built-in dialect of Lisp. These features are compiled into bytecode. This architecture allows users to customize the editor with a high level language, which after compiling into bytecode yields reasonable performance.
*Embeddable Common Lisp implementation of Common Lisp can compile to bytecode or C code
*Common Lisp provides a codice_1 function which prints to the standard output the underlying code of a specified function. The result is implementation-dependent and may or may not resolve to bytecode. Its inspection can be utilized for debugging and optimization purposes. Steel Bank Common Lisp, for instance, produces:
(disassemble &#x27;(lambda (x) (print x)))

<text>In the history of the Americas, the pre-Columbian era, also known as the pre-contact era, or as the pre-Cabraline era specifically in Brazil, spans from the initial peopling of the Americas in the Upper Paleolithic to the onset of European colonization, which began with Christopher Columbus&#x27;s voyage in 1492. This era encompasses the history of Indigenous cultures prior to significant European influence, which in some cases did not occur until decades or even centuries after Columbus&#x27;s arrival.

During the pre-Columbian era, many civilizations developed permanent settlements, cities, agricultural practices, civic and monumental architecture, major earthworks, and complex societal hierarchies. Some of these civilizations had declined by the time of the establishment of the first permanent European colonies, around the late 16th to early 17th centuries, and are known primarily through archaeological research of the Americas and oral histories. Other civilizations, contemporaneous with the colonial period, were documented in European accounts of the time. For instance, the Maya civilization maintained written records, which were often destroyed by Christian Europeans such as Diego de Landa, who viewed them as pagan but sought to preserve native histories. Despite the destruction, a few original documents have survived, and others were transcribed or translated into Spanish, providing modern historians with valuable insights into ancient cultures and knowledge.

==Historiography==
Before the development of archaeology in the 19th century, historians of the pre-Columbian period mainly interpreted the records of the European conquerors and the accounts of early European travelers and antiquaries. It was not until the nineteenth century that the work of people such as John Lloyd Stephens, Eduard Seler, and Alfred Maudslay, and institutions such as the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology of Harvard University, led to the reconsideration and criticism of the early European sources. Now, the scholarly study of pre-Columbian cultures is most often based on scientific and multidisciplinary methodologies.

==Genetics==
The haplogroup most commonly associated with Indigenous Amerindian genetics is Y-chromosome haplogroup Q1a3a. Researchers have found genetic evidence that the Q1a3a haplogroup has been in South America since at least 18,000 BCE. Y-chromosome DNA, like mtDNA, differs from other nuclear chromosomes in that the majority of the Y-chromosome is unique and does not recombine during meiosis. This has the effect that the historical pattern of mutations can easily be studied. The pattern indicates Indigenous peoples of the Americas experienced two very distinctive genetic episodes: first with the initial peopling of the Americas and second with European colonization of the Americas. The former is the determinant factor for the number of gene lineages and founding haplotypes present in today&#x27;s Indigenous populations.

Human settlement of the Americas occurred in stages from the Bering Sea coastline, with an initial 20,000-year layover on Beringia for the founding population. The microsatellite diversity and distributions of the Y lineage specific to South America indicate that certain Amerindian populations have been isolated since the initial colonization of the region. The Na-Dené, Inuit, and Indigenous Alaskan populations exhibit haplogroup Q-M242 (Y-DNA) mutations, however, and are distinct from other Indigenous peoples with various mtDNA mutations. This suggests that the earliest migrants into the northern extremes of North America and Greenland derived from later populations.

==Settlement of the Americas==

Asian nomadic Paleo-Indians are thought to have entered the Americas via the Bering Land Bridge (Beringia), now the Bering Strait, and possibly along the coast. Genetic evidence found in Indigenous peoples&#x27; maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) supports the theory of multiple genetic populations migrating from Asia. After crossing the land bridge, they moved southward along the Pacific coast and through an interior ice-free corridor. Throughout millennia, Paleo-Indians spread throughout the rest of North and South America.

Exactly when the first people migrated into the Americas is the subject of much debate. One of the earliest identifiable cultures was the Clovis culture, with sites dating from some 13,000 years ago. However, older sites dating back to 20,000 years ago have been claimed. Some genetic studies estimate the colonization of the Americas dates from between 40,000 and 13,000 years ago. The chronology of migration models is currently divided into two general approaches. The first is the &quot;short chronology theory&quot; with the first movement beyond Alaska into the Americas occurring no earlier than 14,000–17,000 years ago, followed by successive waves of immigrants. The second belief is the &quot;long chronology theory&quot;, which proposes that the first group of people entered the hemisphere at a much earlier date, possibly 30,000–40,000 years ago or earlier.

Artifacts have been found in both North and South America which have been dated to 14,000 years ago, and accordingly humans have been proposed to have reached Cape Horn at the southern tip of South America by this time. In that case, the Inuit would have arrived separately and at a much later date, probably no more than 2,000 years ago, moving across the ice from Siberia into Alaska.

==North America==
===Lithic and Archaic periods===

The North American climate was unstable as the ice age receded during the Lithic stage. It finally stabilized about 10,000 years ago; climatic conditions were then very similar to today&#x27;s. Within this time frame, roughly about the Archaic Period, numerous archaeological cultures have been identified.

====Lithic stage and early Archaic period====
The unstable climate led to widespread migration, with early Paleo-Indians soon spreading throughout the Americas, diversifying into many hundreds of culturally distinct tribes. The Paleo-Indians were hunter-gatherers, likely characterized by small, mobile bands consisting of approximately 20 to 50 members of an extended family. These groups moved from place to place as preferred resources were depleted and new supplies were sought. During much of the Paleo-Indian period, bands are thought to have subsisted primarily through hunting now-extinct giant land animals such as mastodon and ancient bison. Paleo-Indian groups carried a variety of tools, including distinctive projectile points and knives, as well as less distinctive butchering and hide-scraping implements.

The vastness of the North American continent, and the variety of its climates, ecology, vegetation, fauna, and landforms, led ancient peoples to coalesce into many distinct linguistic and cultural groups. This is reflected in the oral histories of the indigenous peoples, described by a wide range of traditional creation stories which often say that a given people have been living in a certain territory since the creation of the world.

Throughout thousands of years, paleo-Indian people domesticated, bred, and cultivated many plant species, including crops that now constitute 50–60% of worldwide agriculture. In general, Arctic, Subarctic, and coastal peoples continued to live as hunters and gatherers, while agriculture was adopted in more temperate and sheltered regions, permitting a dramatic rise in population.

====Middle Archaic period====
After the migration or migrations, it was several thousand years before the first complex societies arose, the earliest emerging about seven to eight thousand years ago. As early as 5500 BCE, people in the Lower Mississippi Valley at Monte Sano and other sites in present-day Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida were building complex earthwork mounds, probably for religious purposes. Beginning in the late twentieth century, archeologists have studied, analyzed, and dated these sites, realizing that the earliest complexes were built by hunter-gatherer societies, whose people occupied the sites on a seasonal basis. Watson Brake, a large complex of eleven platform mounds, was constructed beginning in 3400 BCE and added to over 500 years. This has changed earlier assumptions that complex construction arose only after societies had adopted agriculture, and become sedentary, with stratified hierarchy and usually ceramics. These ancient people had organized to build complex mound projects under a different social structure.

====Late Archaic period====

Until the accurate dating of Watson Brake and similar sites, the oldest mound complex was thought to be Poverty Point, also located in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Built about 1500 BCE, it is the centerpiece of a culture extending over 100 sites on both sides of the Mississippi. The Poverty Point site has earthworks in the form of six concentric half-circles, divided by radial aisles, together with some mounds. The entire complex is nearly a mile across.

Mound building was continued by succeeding cultures, who built numerous sites in the middle Mississippi and Ohio River valleys as well, adding effigy mounds, conical and ridge mounds, and other shapes.

===Woodland period===

The Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures lasted from roughly 1000 BCE to 1000 CE. The term was coined in the 1930s and refers to prehistoric sites between the Archaic period and the Mississippian cultures. The Adena culture and the ensuing Hopewell tradition during this period built monumental earthwork architecture and established continent-spanning trade and exchange networks.

This period is considered a developmental stage without any massive changes in a short period but instead has a continuous development in stone and bone tools, leatherworking, textile manufacture, tool production, cultivation, and shelter construction. Some Woodland people continued to use spears and atlatls until the end of the period when they were replaced by bows and arrows.

===Mississippian culture===

The Mississippian culture was spread across the Southeast and Midwest of what is today the United States, from the Atlantic coast to the edge of the plains, from the Gulf of Mexico to the Upper Midwest, although most intensively in the area along the Mississippi River and Ohio River. One of the distinguishing features of this culture was the construction of complexes of large earthen mounds and grand plazas, continuing the mound-building traditions of earlier cultures. They grew maize and other crops intensively, participated in an extensive trade network, and had a complex stratified society. The Mississippians first appeared around 1000 CE, following and developing out of the less agriculturally intensive and less centralized Woodland period. The largest urban site of these people, Cahokia—located near modern East St. Louis, Illinois—may have reached a population of over 20,000. Other chiefdoms were constructed throughout the Southeast, and its trade networks reached to the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. At its peak, between the 12th and 13th centuries, Cahokia was the most populous city in North America. (Larger cities did exist in Mesoamerica and the Andes.) Monks Mound, the major ceremonial center of Cahokia, remains the largest earthen construction of the prehistoric Americas. The culture reached its peak in about 1200–1400 CE, and in most places, it seems to have been in decline before the arrival of Europeans.

Many Mississippian peoples were encountered by the expedition of Hernando de Soto in the 1540s, mostly with disastrous results for both sides. Unlike the Spanish expeditions in Mesoamerica, which conquered vast empires with relatively few men, the de Soto expedition wandered the American Southeast for four years, becoming more bedraggled, losing more men and equipment, and eventually arriving in Mexico as a fraction of its original size. The local people fared much worse though, as the fatalities of diseases introduced by the expedition devastated the populations and produced much social disruption. By the time Europeans returned a hundred years later, nearly all of the Mississippian groups had vanished, and vast swaths of their territory were virtually uninhabited.
=== Ancestral Puebloans ===
The Ancestral Puebloans thrived in what is now the Four Corners region in the United States. It is commonly suggested that the culture of the Ancestral Puebloans emerged during the Early Basketmaker II Era during the 12th century BCE. The Ancestral Puebloans were a complex Oasisamerican society that constructed kivas, multi-story houses, and apartment blocks made from stone and adobe, such as the Cliff Palace of Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado and the Great Houses in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. The Puebloans also constructed a road system that stretched from Chaco Canyon to Kutz Canyon in the San Juan Basin. The Ancestral Puebloans are also known as &quot;Anasazi&quot;, though the term is controversial, as the present-day Pueblo peoples consider the term to be derogatory, due to the word tracing its origins to a Navajo word meaning &quot;ancestor enemies&quot;.

=== Hohokam ===

The Hohokam thrived in the Sonoran desert in what is now the U.S. state of Arizona and the Mexican state of Sonora. The Hohokam were responsible for the construction of a series of irrigation canals that led to the successful establishment of Phoenix, Arizona via the Salt River Project. The Hohokam also established complex settlements such as Snaketown, which served as an important commercial trading center. After 1375 CE, Hohokam society collapsed and the people abandoned their settlements, likely due to drought.

=== Mogollon ===

The Mogollon resided in the present-day states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas as well as Sonora and Chihuahua. Like most other cultures in Oasisamerica, the Mogollon constructed sophisticated kivas and cliff dwellings. In the village of Paquimé, the Mogollon are revealed to have housed pens for scarlet macaws, which were introduced from Mesoamerica through trade.

=== Sinagua ===

The Sinagua were hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists who lived in central Arizona. Like the Hohokam, they constructed kivas and great houses as well as ballcourts. Several of the Sinagua ruins include Montezuma Castle, Wupatki, and Tuzigoot.

=== Salado ===

The Salado resided in the Tonto Basin in southeastern Arizona from 1150 CE to the 15th century. Archaeological evidence suggests that they traded with far-away cultures, as evidenced by the presence of seashells from the Gulf of California and macaw feathers from Mexico. Most of the cliff dwellings constructed by the Salado are primarily located in Tonto National Monument.

=== Iroquois ===

The Iroquois League of Nations or &quot;People of the Long House&quot; was a politically advanced, democratic society, which is thought by some historians to have influenced the United States Constitution, with the Senate passing a resolution to this effect in 1988. Other historians have contested this interpretation and believe the impact was minimal or did not exist, pointing to numerous differences between the two systems and the ample precedents for the constitution in European political thought.

=== Calusa ===

The Calusa were a complex paramountcy/kingdom that resided in southern Florida. Instead of agriculture, the Calusa economy relied on abundant fishing. According to Spanish sources, the &quot;king&#x27;s house&quot; at Mound Key was large enough to house 2,000 people. The Calusa ultimately collapsed into extinction at around 1750 after succumbing to diseases introduced by the Spanish colonists.

=== Wichita ===

The Wichita people were a loose confederation that consisted of sedentary agriculturalists and hunter-gatherers who resided in the eastern Great Plains. They lived in permanent settlements and even established a city called Etzanoa, which had a population of 20,000 people. The city was eventually abandoned around the 18th century after it was encountered by Spanish conquistadors Jusepe Gutierrez and Juan de Oñate.

===Historic tribes===
When the Europeans arrived, Indigenous peoples of North America had a wide range of lifeways from sedentary, agrarian societies to semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer societies. Many formed new tribes or confederations in response to European colonization. These are often classified by cultural regions, loosely based on geography. These can include the following:
* Arctic, including Aleut, Inuit, and Yupik peoples
* Subarctic
* Northeastern Woodlands
* Southeastern Woodlands
* Great Plains
* Great Basin
* Northwest Plateau
* Northwest Coast
* California
* Southwest

Numerous pre-Columbian societies were sedentary, such as the Tlingit, Haida, Chumash, Mandan, Hidatsa, and others, and some established large settlements, even cities, such as Cahokia, in what is now Illinois.

==Mesoamerica==

Mesoamerica is the region extending from central Mexico south to the northwestern border of Costa Rica that gave rise to a group of stratified, culturally related agrarian civilizations spanning an approximately 3,000-year period before the visits to the Caribbean by Christopher Columbus. &quot;Mesoamerican&quot; is the adjective generally used to refer to that group of pre-Columbian cultures. This refers to an environmental area occupied by an assortment of ancient cultures that shared religious beliefs, art, architecture, and technology in the Americas for more than three thousand years. Between 2000 and 300 BCE, complex cultures began to form in Mesoamerica. Some matured into advanced pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Olmec, Teotihuacan, Mayas, Zapotecs, Mixtecs, Huastecs, Purepecha, Toltecs, and Mexica/Aztecs. The Mexica civilization is also known as the Aztec Triple Alliance since they were three smaller kingdoms loosely united together.

These Indigenous civilizations are credited with many inventions: building pyramid temples, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, writing, highly accurate calendars, fine arts, intensive agriculture, engineering, an abacus calculator, and complex theology. They also invented the wheel, but it was used solely as a toy. In addition, they used native copper, silver, and gold for metalworking.

Archaic inscriptions on rocks and rock walls all over northern Mexico (especially in the state of Nuevo León) demonstrate an early propensity for counting. Their number system was base 20 and included zero. These early count markings were associated with astronomical events and underscore the influence that astronomical activities had upon Mesoamerican people before the arrival of Europeans. Many of the later Mesoamerican civilizations carefully built their cities and ceremonial centers according to specific astronomical events.

The biggest Mesoamerican cities, such as Teotihuacan, Tenochtitlan, and Cholula, were among the largest in the world. These cities grew as centers of commerce, ideas, ceremonies, and theology, and they radiated influence outwards onto neighboring cultures in central Mexico.

While many city-states, kingdoms, and empires competed with one another for power and prestige, Mesoamerica can be said to have had five major civilizations: the Olmecs, Teotihuacan, the Toltecs, the Mexica, and the Mayas. These civilizations (except for the politically fragmented Maya) extended their reach across Mesoamerica—and beyond—like no others. They consolidated power and distributed influence in matters of trade, art, politics, technology, and theology. Other regional power players made economic and political alliances with these civilizations over 4,000 years. Many made war with them, but almost all peoples found themselves within one of their spheres of influence.

Regional communications in ancient Mesoamerica have been the subject of considerable research. There is evidence of trade routes starting as far north as the Mexico Central Plateau, and going down to the Pacific coast. These trade routes and cultural contacts then went on as far as Central America. These networks operated with various interruptions from pre-Olmec times and up to the Late Classical Period (600–900 CE).

===Olmec civilization===

The earliest known civilization in Mesoamerica is the Olmec. This civilization established the cultural blueprint by which all succeeding indigenous civilizations would follow in Mexico. Pre-Olmec civilization began with the production of pottery in abundance, around 2300 BCE in the Grijalva River delta. Between 1600 and 1500 BCE, the Olmec civilization had begun, with the consolidation of power at their capital, a site today known as San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán near the coast in southeast Veracruz. The Olmec influence extended across Mexico, into Central America, and along the Gulf of Mexico. They transformed many peoples&#x27; thinking toward a new way of government, pyramid temples, writing, astronomy, art, mathematics, economics, and religion. Their achievements paved the way for the Maya civilization and the civilizations in central Mexico.

===Teotihuacan civilization===

The decline of the Olmec resulted in a power vacuum in Mexico. Emerging from that vacuum was Teotihuacan, first settled in 300 BCE. By 150 CE, Teotihuacan had risen to become the first true metropolis of what is now called North America. Teotihuacan established a new economic and political order never before seen in Mexico. Its influence stretched across Mexico into Central America, founding new dynasties in the Maya cities of Tikal, Copan, and Kaminaljuyú. Teotihuacan&#x27;s influence over the Maya civilization cannot be overstated: it transformed political power, artistic depictions, and the nature of economics. Within the city of Teotihuacan was a diverse and cosmopolitan population. Most of the regional ethnicities of Mexico were represented in the city, such as Zapotecs from the Oaxaca region. They lived in apartment communities where they worked their trades and contributed to the city&#x27;s economic and cultural prowess. Teotihuacan&#x27;s economic pull impacted areas in northern Mexico as well. It was a city whose monumental architecture reflected a monumental new era in Mexican civilization, declining in political power about 650 CE—but lasting in cultural influence for the better part of a millennium, to around 950 CE.
===Maya civilization===
Contemporary to Teotihuacan&#x27;s greatness was that of the Maya civilization. The period between 250 CE and 650 CE was a time of intense flourishing of Maya civilized accomplishments. While the many Maya city-states never achieved political unity on the order of the central Mexican civilizations, they exerted tremendous intellectual influence upon Mexico and Central America. The Maya built some of the most elaborate cities on the continent and made innovations in mathematics, astronomy, and calendrics. The Maya also developed the only true writing system native to the Americas using pictographs and syllabic elements in the form of texts and codices inscribed on stone, pottery, wood, or perishable books made from bark paper.

=== Huastec civilization ===
The Huastecs were a Maya ethnic group that migrated northwards to the Gulf Coast of Mexico. The Huastecs are considered to be distinct from the Maya civilization, as they separated from the main Maya branch at around 2000 BCE and did not possess the Maya script. Other accounts also suggest that the Huastecs migrated as a result of the Classic Maya collapse around the year 900 CE.

=== Zapotec civilization ===
The Zapotecs were a civilization that thrived in the Oaxaca Valley from the late 6th century BCE until their downfall at the hands of the Spanish conquistadors. The city of Monte Albán was an important religious center for the Zapotecs and served as the capital of the empire from 700 BCE to 700 CE. The Zapotecs resisted the expansion of the Aztecs until they were subjugated in 1502 under Aztec emperor Ahuitzotl. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Zapotecs resisted Spanish rule until King Cosijopii I surrendered in 1563.

=== Mixtec civilization ===
Like the Zapotecs, the Mixtecs thrived in the Oaxaca Valley. The Mixtecs consisted of separate independent kingdoms and city-states, rather than a single unified empire. The Mixtecs would eventually be conquered by the Aztecs until the Spanish conquest. The Mixtecs saw the Spanish conquest as an opportunity for liberation and established agreements with the conquistadors that allowed them to preserve their cultural traditions, though relatively few sections resisted Spanish rule.

=== Totonac civilization ===

The Totonac civilization was concentrated in the present-day states of Veracruz and Puebla. The Totonacs were responsible for the establishment of cities, such as El Tajín as important commercial trading centers. The Totonacs would later assist in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire as an opportunity to liberate themselves from Aztec military imperialism.

=== Toltec civilization ===
The Toltec civilization was established in the 8th century CE. The Toltec Empire expanded its political borders to as far south as the Yucatán peninsula, including the Maya city of Chichen Itza. The Toltecs established vast trading relations with other Mesoamerican civilizations in Central America and the Puebloans in present-day New Mexico. During the Post-Classic era, the Toltecs suffered a subsequent collapse in the early 12th century, due to famine and civil war. The Toltec civilization was so influential to the point where many groups such as the Aztecs claimed to be descended from.

===Aztec/Mexica/Triple Alliance civilization===

With the decline of the Toltec civilization came political fragmentation in the Valley of Mexico. Into this new political game of contenders to the Toltec throne stepped outsiders: the Mexica. They were also a desert people, one of seven groups who formerly called themselves &quot;Azteca&quot;, in memory of Aztlán, but they changed their name after years of migrating. Since they were not from the Valley of Mexico, they were initially seen as crude and unrefined in the ways of the Nahua civilization. Through political maneuvers and ferocious martial skills, they managed to rule Mexico as the head of the &#x27;Triple Alliance&#x27; which included two other Aztec cities, Tetxcoco and Tlacopan.

Latecomers to Mexico&#x27;s central plateau, the Mexica thought of themselves, nevertheless, as heirs of the civilizations that had preceded them. For them, arts, sculpture, architecture, engraving, feather-mosaic work, and the calendar, were bequest from the former inhabitants of Tula, the Toltecs.

The Mexica-Aztecs were the rulers of much of central Mexico by about 1400 (while Yaquis, Coras, and Apaches commanded sizable regions of northern desert), having subjugated most of the other regional states by the 1470s. At their peak, the Valley of Mexico where the Aztec Empire presided, saw a population growth that included nearly one million people during the late Aztec period (1350–1519).

Their capital, Tenochtitlan, is the site of modern-day Mexico City. At its peak, it was one of the largest cities in the world with population estimates of 200,000–300,000. The market established there was the largest ever seen by the conquistadores on arrival.

===Tarascan/Purépecha civilization===
Initially, the lands that would someday comprise the lands of the powerful Tarascan Empire were inhabited by several independent communities. Around 1300, however, the first Cazonci, Tariacuri, united these communities and built them into one of the most advanced civilizations in Mesoamerica. Their capital at Tzintzuntzan was just one of the many cities—there were ninety more under its control. The Tarascan Empire was among the largest in Central America, so it is no surprise that they routinely came into conflict with the neighboring Aztec Empire. Out of all the civilizations in its area, the Tarascan Empire was the most prominent in metallurgy, harnessing copper, silver, and gold to create items such as tools, decorations, and even weapons and armor. Bronze was also used. The great victories over the Aztecs by the Tarascans cannot be understated. Nearly every war they fought in resulted in a Tarascan victory. Because the Tarascan Empire had little links to the former Toltec Empire, they were also quite independent in culture from their neighbors. The Aztecs, Tlaxcaltec, Olmec, Mixtec, Maya, and others were very similar to each other, however. This is because they were all directly preceded by the Toltecs, and they therefore shared almost identical cultures. The Tarascans, however, possessed a unique religion, as well as other things.

=== Tlaxcala republic ===

Tlaxcala was a Nahua republic and confederation in central Mexico. The Tlaxcalans fiercely resisted Aztec expansion during the Flower Wars ever since the Aztecs expelled them from Lake Texcoco. The Tlaxcalans would later ally with the Spanish conquistadors under Hernán Cortés as an opportunity to liberate them from the Aztecs and managed to successfully conquer the Aztecs with the help of the conquistadors. The Spaniards would reward the Tlaxcalans for preserving their culture and for their assistance in defeating the Aztecs. The Tlaxcalans would once again assist to the Spaniards during the Mixtón War and the conquest of Guatemala.

=== Cuzcatlan ===

Cuzcatlan was a Pipil confederacy of kingdoms and city-states located in present-day El Salvador. According to legend, Cuzcatlan was established by Toltec migrants during the Classic Maya collapse in approximately 1200 CE. During the Spanish conquest of El Salvador, Cuzcatlan was forced to surrender to conquistador Pedro de Alvarado in 1528.

=== Lenca ===

The Lenca people were composed of several distinct multilingual confederations and city-states in present-day El Salvador and Honduras. Cities such as Yarumela were important commercial centers for the Lenca. During the Spanish conquest, several Lenca leaders such as Lempira resisted conversion to Christianity, while others converted peacefully.

=== Nicānāhuac ===

Nicānāhuac (&quot;Here Surrounded By Water&quot; in Nahuatl) was the geographical endonym used by the Nicarao, an offshoot of the Pipil people from El Salvador, to refer to western Nicaragua. The Nicarao had multiple chiefdoms that were independent from one another, these chiefdoms ranged from the Chinandega department in northwestern Nicaragua to Guanacaste province in northwestern Costa Rica. Although the Nicarao chiefdoms shared the same language, culture, and ethnicity, they were never unified under a single political entity as Kuskatan was in El Salvador. The Nicarao civilization collapsed during the Spanish conquest of Nicaragua in 1522.

=== Nicoya kingdom ===

The Nicoya kingdom was an elective monarchy that thrived in the Nicoya peninsula in Costa Rica. It existed from 800 CE until the Spanish arrival in the 16th century.

== South America ==

By the first millennium, South America&#x27;s vast rainforests, mountains, plains, and coasts were the home of millions of people. Estimates vary, but 30–50 million are often given, and 100 million by some estimates. Some groups formed permanent settlements. Among those groups were Chibcha-speaking peoples (&quot;Muisca&quot; or &quot;Muysca&quot;), Valdivia, Quimbaya, Calima, Marajoara culture, and the Tairona. The Muisca of Colombia, postdating the Herrera Period, Valdivia of Ecuador, the Quechuas, and the Aymara of Peru and Bolivia were the four most important sedentary Amerindian groups in South America. Since the 1970s, numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land in the Amazon rainforest, Brazil, supporting Spanish accounts of complex and ancient Amazonian civilizations, such as Kuhikugu. The Upano Valley sites in present-day eastern Ecuador predate all known complex Amazonian societies.

The theory of pre-Columbian contact across the South Pacific Ocean between South America and Polynesia has received support from several lines of evidence, although solid confirmation remains elusive. A diffusion by human agents has been put forward to explain the pre-Columbian presence in Oceania of several cultivated plant species native to South America, such as the bottle gourd (&quot;Lagenaria siceraria&quot;) or sweet potato (&quot;Ipomoea batatas&quot;). Direct archaeological evidence for such pre-Columbian contacts and transport has not emerged. Similarities noted in the names of edible roots in Maori and Ecuadorian languages (&quot;kumari&quot;) and Melanesian and Chilean (&quot;gaddu&quot;) have been inconclusive.

A 2007 paper published in &quot;PNAS&quot; put forward DNA and archaeological evidence that domesticated chickens had been introduced into South America via Polynesia by late pre-Columbian times. These findings were challenged by a later study published in the same journal, that cast doubt on the dating calibration used and presented alternative mtDNA analyses that disagreed with a Polynesian genetic origin. The origin and dating remain an open issue. Whether or not early Polynesian–American exchanges occurred, no compelling human-genetic, archaeological, cultural, or linguistic legacy of such contact has turned up.

===Norte Chico civilization===
On the north-central coast of present-day Peru, Norte Chico or Caral-Supe (as known in Peru) was a civilization that emerged around 3200 BCE (contemporary with urbanism&#x27;s rise in Mesopotamia). It had a cluster of large-scale urban settlements of which the Sacred City of Caral, in the Supe Valley, is one of the largest and best-studied sites. The civilization did not know machinery or pottery but still managed to develop trade, especially cotton and dehydrated fish. It was a hierarchical society that managed its ecosystems and had intercultural exchange. Its economy was heavily dependent on agriculture and fishing on the nearby coast. It is considered one of the cradles of civilization in the world and Caral-Supe is the oldest known civilization in the Americas.

===Valdivia culture===

The Valdivia culture was concentrated on the coast of Ecuador. Their existence was recently discovered by archeological findings. Their culture is among the oldest found in the Americas, spanning from 3500 to 1800 BCE. The Valdivia lived in a community of houses built in a circle or oval around a central plaza. They were sedentary people who lived off farming and fishing, though occasionally they hunted for deer. From the remains that have been found, scholars have determined that Valdivians cultivated maize, kidney beans, squash, cassava, chili peppers, and cotton plants, the last of which was used to make clothing. Valdivian pottery initially was rough and practical, but it became showy, delicate, and big over time. They generally used red and gray colors, and the polished dark red pottery is characteristic of the Valdivia period. In its ceramics and stone works, the Valdivia culture shows a progression from the most simple to much more complicated works.

===Cañari people===

The Cañari were the indigenous natives of today&#x27;s Ecuadorian provinces of Cañar and Azuay. They were an elaborate civilization with advanced architecture and complex religious beliefs. The Inca destroyed and burned most of their remains. The Cañari&#x27;s old city was replaced twice, first by the Incan city of Tumebamba and later on the same site by the colonial city of Cuenca. The city was also believed to be the site of El Dorado, the city of gold from the mythology of Colombia.

The Cañari were most notable for having repelled the Incan invasion with fierce resistance for many years until they fell to Tupac Yupanqui. Many of their descendants are still present in Cañar. The majority did not mix with the colonists or become Mestizos.

===Chavín civilization===
The Chavín, a Peruvian preliterate civilization, established a trade network and developed agriculture by 900 BCE, according to some estimates and archeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chavín de Huántar in modern Peru at an elevation of . The Chavín civilization spanned from 900 to 300 BCE.

=== Muisca confederation ===

The Chibcha-speaking communities were the most numerous, the most territorially extended and the most socio-economically developed of the pre-Hispanic Colombians. By the 8th century, the indigenous people had established their civilization in the northern Andes. At one point, the Chibchas occupied part of what is now Panama, and the high plains of the Eastern Sierra of Colombia.

The areas that they occupied in Colombia were the present-day Departments of Santander (North and South), Boyacá, and Cundinamarca. This is where the first farms and industries were developed. It is also where the independence movement originated. They are currently the richest areas in Colombia. The Chibcha developed the most populous zone between the Maya region and the Inca Empire. Next to the Quechua of Peru and the Aymara in Bolivia, the Chibcha of the eastern and north-eastern Highlands of Colombia developed the most notable culture among the sedentary Indigenous peoples in South America.

In the Colombian Andes, the Chibcha comprised several tribes who spoke similar languages (Chibcha). They included the following: the Muisca, Guane, Lache, Cofán, and Chitareros.

=== Tairona confederation ===
The Tairona civilization thrived in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range in northern Colombia. Studies suggest that the civilization thrived from the 1st century CE until the Spanish arrival in the 16th century. The descendants of the Tairona, such as the Kogi were one of the few indigenous groups in the Americas to have escaped full colonial conquest and retain a majority of their indigenous cultures.

===Moche civilization===

The Moche thrived on the north coast of Peru from about 100 to 800 CE. The heritage of the Moche is seen in their elaborate burials. Some were recently excavated by UCLA&#x27;s Christopher B. Donnan in association with the National Geographic Society.

As skilled artisans, the Moche were a technologically advanced people. They traded with distant peoples such as the Maya. What has been learned about the Moche is based on the study of their ceramic pottery; the carvings reveal details of their daily lives. The Larco Museum of Lima, Peru, has an extensive collection of such ceramics. They show that the people practiced human sacrifice, had blood-drinking rituals and that their religion incorporated non-procreative sexual practices (such as fellatio).

=== Wari Empire ===

The Wari Empire was located in the western portion of Peru and existed from the 6th century to the 11th century. Wari, as the former capital city was called, is located 11 km (6.8 mi) northeast of the city of Ayacucho. This city was the center of a civilization that covered much of the highlands and coast of Peru. The best-preserved remnants, besides the Wari Ruins, are the recently discovered Northern Wari ruins near the city of Chiclayo, and Cerro Baul in Moquegua. Also well-known are the Wari ruins of &quot;Pikillaqta&quot; (&quot;Flea Town&quot;), a short distance southeast of the Cusco &quot;en route&quot; to Lake Titicaca.

===Tiwanaku Empire===
The Tiwanaku empire was based in western Bolivia and extended into present-day Peru and Chile from 300 to 1000 CE. Tiwanaku is recognized by Andean scholars as one of the most important South American civilizations before the birth of the Inca Empire in Peru; it was the ritual and administrative capital of a major state power for approximately five hundred years. The ruins of the ancient city state are near the south-eastern shore of Lake Titicaca in Tiwanaku Municipality, Ingavi Province, La Paz Department, about west of La Paz.

===Inca Empire===

Holding their capital at the great cougar-shaped city of Cusco, Peru, the Inca civilization dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533. Known as &quot;Tawantinsuyu&quot;, or &quot;the land of the four regions&quot;, in Quechua, the Inca civilization was highly distinct and developed. Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities, some 9 to 14 million people connected by a 40,000-kilometer road system. Cities were built with precise stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. Terrace farming was a useful form of agriculture. There is evidence of excellent metalwork and even successful brain surgery in the Inca civilization.
=== Aymara kingdoms ===

The Aymara kingdoms consisted of a confederation of separate diarchies that lasted from 1151 after the fall of Tiwanaku until 1477 when they were conquered by the Inca Empire. The Aymara kingdoms were primarily located in the Altiplano in Bolivia as well as some parts of Peru and Chile.

===Arawaks and Caribs===
Archeologists have discovered evidence of the earliest known inhabitants of the Venezuelan area in the form of leaf-shaped flake tools, together with chopping and plano– scraping implements exposed on the high riverine terraces of the Pedregal River in western Venezuela. Late Pleistocene hunting artifacts, including spear tips, come from a similar site in northwestern Venezuela known as &quot;El Jobo&quot;. According to radiocarbon dating, these date from 13,000 to 7000 BCE.

Taima-Taima, yellow Muaco, and El Jobo in Falcón are some of the sites that have yielded archeological material from these times. These groups co-existed with megafauna like megatherium, glyptodonts, and toxodonts.

It is not known how many people lived in Venezuela before the Spanish Conquest; it may have been around a million people, in addition to today&#x27;s peoples included groups such as the Arawaks, Caribs, and Timoto-cuicas. The number was much reduced after the Conquest, mainly through the spread of new diseases from Europe. There were two main north–south axes of the pre-Columbian population, producing maize in the west and manioc in the east. Large parts of the Llanos plains were cultivated through a combination of slash-and-burn and permanent settled agriculture basically maize and tobacco. The indigenous peoples of Venezuela had already encountered crude oils and asphalts that seeped up through the ground to the surface. Known to the locals as &quot;mene&quot;, the thick, black liquid was primarily used for medicinal purposes, as an illumination source, and for the caulking of canoes.

In the 16th century when Spanish colonization began in Venezuelan territory, the population of several indigenous peoples such as the Mariches (descendants of the Caribes) declined.

=== Diaguita confederation ===
The Diaguita consisted of several distinct chiefdoms across the Argentine Northwest. The Diaguita culture emerged around 1000 CE after the replacement of the Las Ánimas complex. The Diaguita resisted Spanish colonialism during the Calchaquí Wars until they were forced to surrender and submit to Spanish rule in 1667.

=== Taíno ===

The Taíno people were fragmented into numerous chiefdoms across the Greater Antilles, the Lucayan Archipelago, and the northern Lesser Antilles. The Taíno were the first pre-Columbian people to encounter Christopher Columbus during his voyage in 1492. The Taíno would later be subject to slavery by the Spanish colonists under the &quot;encomienda&quot; system until they were deemed virtually extinct in 1565.

=== Huetar kingdoms ===

The Huetar people were a major ethnic group that lived in Costa Rica. The Huetar were composed of several independent kingdoms, such as the western kingdom ruled by Garabito and the eastern kingdom ruled by El Guarco and Correque. After their annexation into Spanish administration, the descendants of the Huetar currently reside in the Quitirrisí reserve.

=== Marajoara culture ===

The Marajoara culture flourished on Marajó Island at the mouth of the Amazon River in northern Brazil between 800 and 1400 CE. The Marajoara consisted of a complex society that built mounds and constructed sophisticated settlements. The indigenous people of the area adopted methods of large-scale agriculture through the use of &quot;terra preta&quot;, which would support complex chiefdoms. Studies suggest that the civilization housed around 100,000 inhabitants.

=== Kuhikugu ===

Located in the Xingu Indigenous Park in Brazil, Kuhikugu consisted of an urban complex that housed around 50,000 inhabitants and 20 settlements. The civilization was likely established by the ancestors of the Kuikuro people. The people also constructed roads, bridges, and trenches for defensive purposes and were purported to be farmers, as evidenced by the fields of cassava and the use of &quot;terra preta&quot;. Like most other Amazonian civilizations, the disappearance of Kuhikugu was largely attributed to Old World diseases introduced by European colonists.

===Cambeba===

Also known as the Omagua, Umana, and Kambeba, the Cambeba are an indigenous people in Brazil&#x27;s Amazon basin. The Cambeba were a populous, organized society in the late pre-Columbian era whose population suffered a steep decline in the early years of the Columbian Exchange. The Spanish explorer Francisco de Orellana traversed the Amazon River during the 16th century and reported densely populated regions running hundreds of kilometers along the river. These populations left no lasting monuments, possibly because they used local wood as their construction material as stone was not locally available. While it is possible Orellana may have exaggerated the level of development among the Amazonians, their semi-nomadic descendants have the odd distinction among tribal indigenous societies of a hereditary, yet landless, aristocracy. Archaeological evidence has revealed the continued presence of semi-domesticated orchards, as well as vast areas of land enriched with &quot;terra preta&quot;. Both of these discoveries, along with Cambeba ceramics discovered within the same archaeological levels suggest that a large and organized civilization existed in the area.

=== Upano Valley cultures ===

In the Upano River valley of eastern Ecuador, several cities were established by the Upano and Kilamope cultures around 500 BCE. The cities in the Upano Valley consisted of agricultural societies that cultivated crops such as corn, manioc and sweet potato. The cities fell into decline around 600 CE.

==Agricultural development==
Early inhabitants of the Americas developed agriculture, developing and breeding wild maize (corn) from ears in length to the current size that is familiar today. Potatoes, cassava, tomatoes, tomatillos (a husked green tomato), pumpkins, chili peppers, squash, beans, pineapple, sweet potatoes, the grains quinoa and amaranth, cocoa beans, vanilla, onion, peanuts, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, papaya, and avocados were among other plants grown by natives. Over two-thirds of all types of food crops grown worldwide are native to the Americas.

Early Indigenous peoples began using fire in a widespread manner. Intentional burning of vegetation was taken up to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories, thereby making travel easier and facilitating the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants that were important for both food and medicines. This created the pre-Columbian savannas of North America.

While not as widespread as in Afro-Eurasia, indigenous Americans did have livestock. Domesticated turkeys were common in Mesoamerica and some regions of North America; they were valued for their meat, feathers, and, possibly, eggs. There is documentation of Mesoamericans utilizing hairless dogs, especially the Xoloitzcuintle breed, for their meat. Andean societies had llamas and alpacas for meat and wool, as well as for beasts of burden. Guinea pigs were raised for meat in the Andes. Iguanas and a range of wild animals, such as deer and pecari, were another source of meat in Mexico, Central, and northern South America.

By the 15th century, maize had been transmitted from Mexico and was being farmed in the Mississippi embayment, as far as the East Coast of the United States, and as far north as southern Canada. Potatoes were used by the Inca, and chocolate was used by the Aztecs.

<text>Filippo di ser Brunellesco di Lippo Lapi (1377 – 15 April 1446), commonly known as Filippo Brunelleschi ( ; ) and also nicknamed Pippo by Leon Battista Alberti, was an Italian architect, designer, goldsmith and sculptor. He is considered to be a founding father of Renaissance architecture. He is recognized as the first modern engineer, planner, and sole construction supervisor. In 1421, Brunelleschi became the first person to receive a patent in the Western world. He is most famous for designing the dome of the Florence Cathedral, and for the mathematical technique of linear perspective in art which governed pictorial depictions of space until the late 19th century and influenced the rise of modern science. His accomplishments also include other architectural works, sculpture, mathematics, engineering, and ship design. Most surviving works can be found in Florence.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Brunelleschi was born in Florence, Italy, in 1377. His father was Brunellesco di Lippo (born ), a notary and civil servant. His mother was Giuliana Spini; he had two brothers. The family was well-off; the palace of the Spini family still exists, across from the Church of the Trinità in Florence. The young Filippo was given a literary and mathematical education to enable him to follow the father&#x27;s career. Being artistically inclined, however, Filippo, at the age of fifteen, was apprenticed at the &quot;Arte della Seta&quot;, the wool merchants&#x27; guild, the wealthiest and most prestigious guild in the city, which also included jewellers and metal craftsmen. In December 1398, he became a master goldsmith and a sculptor working with cast bronze.

===Sculpture – Competition for the Florence Baptistry doors===

Brunelleschi&#x27;s earliest surviving sculptures are two small bronze statues of evangelists and saints (1399–1400) made for the altar of the Crucifix Chapel Pistoia Cathedral. He paused this project in 1400, when he was chosen to simultaneously serve two representative councils of the Florentine government for about four months.

Around the end of 1400, the city of Florence decided to create new sculpted and gilded bronze doors for the Florence Baptistery. A competition was held in 1401 for the design, which drew seven competitors, including Brunelleschi and another young sculptor, Lorenzo Ghiberti. Each sculptor had to produce a single bronze panel, depicting the Sacrifice of Isaac within a Gothic four-leaf frame. The panels each contained Abraham, Isaac, an angel and other figures imagined by the artists, and had to harmonize in style with the existing doors, produced in 1330 by Andrea Pisano. The head of the jury was Giovanni di Bicci de&#x27; Medici, who later became an important patron of Brunelleschi. The jury initially praised Ghiberti&#x27;s panel. When they saw Brunelleschi&#x27;s work, they were unable to choose between the two and suggested that the two artists collaborate on the project. Brunelleschi refused to forfeit total control of the project, preferring it to be awarded to Ghiberti. This divided public opinion.

Brunelleschi would eventually abandon sculpture and devote his attention entirely to architecture and optics, but continued to receive sculpture commissions until at least 1416.

===Rediscovery of antiquity (1402–1404)===
During the Early Renaissance, there was a growing interest in ancient Greek and Roman art.Compared to medieval art, which was largely dominated by Byzantine art. Initially this cultural interest was borne by a few scholars, writers, and philosophers. It later became more influential across the visual arts. In this period (1402–1404), Brunelleschi visited Rome, almost certainly accompanied by his younger friend, the sculptor Donatello, to study its ancient ruins. Donatello may have been trained as a goldsmith, like Brunelleschi, and later worked in the studio of Ghiberti. Although the glories of Ancient Rome were a matter of popular discourse at the time, few people had actually studied the physical conditions of its ruins in any detail until Brunelleschi and Donatello did so. Brunelleschi&#x27;s study of classical Roman architecture influenced his building designs including even lighting, the minimization of distinct architectural elements within a building, and the balancing of those elements to homogenize the space.

It has been speculated that Brunelleschi developed his system of linear perspective after observing the Roman ruins. However, some historians dispute that he visited Rome then, given the number of projects Brunelleschi had in Florence at the time, the poverty and lack of security in Rome during that period, and the lack of evidence of the visit. His first definitively documented visit to Rome was in 1432.

===The Foundling Hospital (1419–1445) ===

Brunelleschi&#x27;s first architectural commission was the (1419–c. 1445), or Foundling Hospital, designed as a home for orphans. The Guild of the Silk Merchants&#x27; Guild owned, funded and managed the hospital. As with many of Brunelleschi&#x27;s architectural projects, the building was completed after a significant time lapse and with considerable modifications by other architects. He was the official architect until 1427, but he was rarely on site after 1423. The hospital was completed by the Florentine architect in 1445.

The major portion completed by Brunelleschi was an arcade or loggia with nine arches, supported on each side by pilasters, which gave the appearance of columns, and opening to the interior by a small door. The arcade was supported by slender columns with Corinthian capitals. This first arcade, with its columns, rounded arches and simple classical decoration, became an established model for numerous Renaissance buildings across Europe. Its long loggia and the 8m high arches were an outstanding sight along the narrow and bending streets of Florence. The building&#x27;s style was dignified and sober, with no displays of fine marble or decorative inlays. It was also the first building in Florence to make clear reference—in its columns and capitals—to classical antiquity.
Thereafter Brunelleschi was awarded additional commissions, like the Ridolfi Chapel in the church of San Jacopo sopr&#x27;Arno (not surviving), and the Barbadori Chapel in Santa Felicita (since modified). In both projects Brunelleschi devised elements already used in the Ospedale degli Innocenti, and which would also be used in the Pazzi Chapel and the Sagrestia Vecchia. He was using these relatively small projects to pilot ideas which he would later employ in his most famous work, the dome of the Cathedral of Florence.

===Basilica of San Lorenzo (1421–1442)===
Brunelleschi undertook the major project of the Basilica of San Lorenzo soon after he had begun the Foundling Hospital. The Basilica was the largest church in Florence, sponsored by the Medici family (the church hosted the family&#x27;s mausoleum). Numerous architects worked at the church, including, later, Michelangelo. Brunelleschi designed the central nave, with the two collateral naves on either side lined by small chapels, and the old sacristy.

The first stage of the project was the Old Sacristy, built between 1419 and 1429. It contains the tomb of Giovanni di Bicci de&#x27; Medici and his wife, beneath a central dome, simply decorated. The chapel is a cube of about on each side, covered with a hemispheric dome. A level of ornamental entablements divides the vertical space into two parts, and pilasters support the dome. The altar is set into a recess at one end beneath a smaller dome. All of the arcs of the ceiling are supported by pilasters, like classical columns, set into the walls. This room, using classical elements in an innovative way, established itself as a standard in Renaissance interior architecture.

Along the nave, slender columns with Corinthian capitals replaced the massive pillars of Gothic architecture. A coffered ceiling of square compartments with delicately gilded trim replaced the traditional vaulted ceiling of the central nave. Circular windows above each chapel were introduced to bridge the difference in height between the low chapels and the much higher nave. The new interior projected an impression of harmony and balance.

Brunelleschi used white walls in the Old Sacristy, which later became a common element of Renaissance architecture. Leon Battista Alberti (who wrote in 1450 the standard text of Renaissance art) argued that, since classical times, according to prominent authors like Cicero and Plato, white was the only color suitable for a temple or church and praised &quot;the purity and simplicity of the color, like that of life.&quot;

===Basilica of Santo Spirito (1434–1466)===
The Basilica of Santo Spirito in Florence was his next major project, which, characteristically, he carried out in parallel with his other major works. Though he began designing in 1434, construction did not begin until 1436, and continued beyond his lifetime. The columns for the facade were not delivered until 1446, ten days before his death, and the facade was not completed until 1482, and then was modified in the 18th century. The bell tower was also a later addition.

Santo Spirito is an example of the mathematical proportion and harmony of Brunelleschi&#x27;s work. The church is in the form of a cross. The choir, the two arms of the transept, and the space in the center of the transept are composed of squares exactly the same size. The continuation of the nave contains four more identical squares. and a half-square (a later addition) at the end. The length of the transept is exactly one-one half of the length of the nave. Each square of the lower collateral naves is one-quarter the size of the squares in the principal nave. The collateral naves are lined with thirty-eight small chapels, which were later filled with altars decorated with works of art.

The vertical plan is also perfectly in proportion; the height of the central nave is exactly twice its width, and the height of the collateral naves on either side are exactly twice their width. Other aspects of his original plan, however, were modified after his death. The main aisle of the nave, lined by columns with Corinthian capitals, is topped by a row of semicircular arches, like his galleries. His original plan called the ceiling of the nave to be composed of a barrel vault, which would have echoed the collateral naves, but this was also changed after his death to the flat coffered ceiling. Little remains of the exterior walls that he had planned. They were unfinished at his death and were covered with a facade in a different style in the Baroque period.
===Pazzi Chapel (1430–1444)===
The Pazzi Chapel in Florence was commissioned in about 1429 by Andrea Pazzi to serve as the Chapter House, or meeting place of the monks of the Monastery of Santa Croce. Like nearly all of his works, the actual construction was delayed, beginning only in 1442, and the interior was not finished until 1444. The building was not entirely finished until about 1469, twenty years after his death. Some of the details, such as the lantern on top of the dome, were added after his death.

The portico of the chapel is especially notable for its fine proportions, simplicity, and harmony. Its centerpiece is a sort of arch of triumph. Its six columns are by an entablature sculpted medallions, an upper level divided by pilasters and a central arch, and another band of sculpted entablature the top, below a terrace and the simple cupola. The interior spaces are framed by arches, entablatures, and pilasters. The floor is also divided into geometric sections. Light comes downward from the circular windows of the dome, and changes throughout the day. The interior is given touches of color by circular blue and white ceramic plaques made by the sculptor Luca Della Robbia. The architecture of the chapel is based on an arrangement of rectangles, rather than squares, which makes it appear slightly less balanced than his chapel in the Old Sacristy of San Lorenzo.

===Santa Maria degli Angeli (1434–1437)===
Santa Maria degli Angeli was an unfinished project by Brunelleschi which introduced a revolutionary concept in Renaissance architecture. Churches since the Romanesque and Gothic periods were traditionally in the form of a cross, with the altar in the transept or crossing point. Santa Maria deli Angeli was designed as a rotunda in an octagon shape, with eight equal sides, each containing a chapel, and the altar in the center.

The financing of the church came from the legacy of two Florentine merchants, Matteo and Andrea Scolari, and construction commenced in 1434. However, in 1437, the money for the church was seized by the Florentine government to help finance a war against the neighboring city of Lucca. The structure, which had reached a height of , was never completed as Brunelleschi designed it. The completed part was later integrated into a later church of a different design.

The plans and model of Brunelleschi&#x27;s church disappeared, and it is known only from an illustration in the &quot;Codex Rustichi&quot; from 1450, and from drawings of other architects. Leon Battista Alberti, in his &quot;De re aedificatoria&quot;, the first major treatise on Renaissance architecture, written in about 1455 and published in 1485, hailed the design as the &quot;first complete plan of a Renaissance church.&quot; Leonardo da Vinci visited Florence in about 1490, studied Brunelleschi&#x27;s churches and plans, and sketched a plan for a similar octagonal church with radiating chapels in his notebooks. It reached its fruition on an even larger scale in the 16th century. Donato Bramante proposed a similar central plan with radiating chapels for his Tempieto, and later, on an even larger scale, in his plan for Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica (1485–1514). The central plan was finally realized, with some modifications, beginning in 1547, in Saint Peter&#x27;s by Michelangelo and then its completed version by Carlo Maderna.

===Florence Cathedral dome (1420–1461)===
Santa Maria del Fiore was the cathedral and symbol of Florence, which had been begun in 1296. After the death of the first architect, Arnolfo di Cambio, work was interrupted for fifty years. The &quot;campanile&quot;, or bell tower, was added by Giotto soon after 1330. Between 1334 and 1366 a committee of architects and painters made a plan of a proposed dome, and the constructors were sworn to follow the plan. The proposed dome from the base to the lantern on top was more than high, and the octagonal base was almost in diameter. It was larger than the dome of the ancient Pantheon, or any other dome in Europe, and no dome of that size had been built since antiquity.

A competition was held in 1418 to select the builder, and other competitors included his old rival Ghiberti. It was won by Brunelleschi, with the help of a brick scale model of the dome made for him by his friend the sculptor Donatello. Since buttresses were forbidden by the city fathers, and because obtaining rafters for scaffolding long and strong enough (and in sufficient quantity) for the task was impossible, how a dome of that size could be constructed without its collapsing under its own weight was unclear. Furthermore, the stresses of compression were not clearly understood, and the mortars used in the period would set only after several days, keeping the strain on the scaffolding for a long time.

The work on the dome (built 1420–1436), the lantern (built 1446–c. 1461) and the exedra (built 1439–1445) occupied most of the remainder of Brunelleschi&#x27;s life. Brunelleschi&#x27;s success can be attributed to his technical and mathematical genius. Brunelleschi used more than four million bricks in the construction of the octagonal dome. Notably, Brunelleschi left behind no building plans or diagrams detailing the dome&#x27;s structure; scholars surmise that he constructed the dome as though it were hemispherical, which would have allowed the dome to support itself.

Brunelleschi constructed two domes, one within the other, a practice that would later be followed by all the successive major domes, including those of Les Invalides in Paris and the United States Capitol in Washington. The outer dome protected the inner dome from the rain and allowed a higher and more majestic form. The frame of the dome is composed of twenty-eight horizontal and vertical marble ribs, or &quot;eperoni&quot;, eight of which are visible on the outside. Those visible on the outside are largely decorative, since the outer dome is supported by the structure of the inner dome. A narrow stairway runs upward between the two domes to the lantern on the top. Older examples of double-shelled domes include the 50m tall Dome of Soltaniyeh and the Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi.

Brunelleschi invented a new hoisting machine for raising the masonry needed for the dome, a task no doubt inspired by republication of Vitruvius&#x27; &quot;De architectura&quot;, which describes Roman machines used in the first century AD to build large structures such as the Pantheon and the Baths of Diocletian, structures still standing, which he would have seen for himself. This hoisting machine would be admired by Leonardo da Vinci years later.

The strength of the dome was improved by the wooden and sandstone chains invented by Brunelleschi, which acted like tensioning rings around the base of the dome and reduced the need for flying buttresses, so popular in Gothic architecture. The herringbone brick-laying pattern, which Brunelleschi may have seen in Rome, was also seemingly forgotten in Europe before the construction of the dome.

Brunelleschi kept his workers up in the building during their breaks and brought food and diluted wine, similar to that given to pregnant women at the time, up to them. He felt the trip up and down the hundreds of stairs would exhaust them and reduce their productivity.

Once the dome was completed, a new competition was held in 1436 for the decorative lantern on top of the dome, once again against his old rival Ghiberti. Brunelleschi won the competition and designed the structure and built the base for the lantern, but he did not live long enough to see its final installation atop the dome.

In 1438 Brunelleschi designed his last contribution to the cathedral; four hemispherical exedra, or small half-domes, based on a Roman model, set against the drum at the base of the main dome. They alternated the four small domes arranged around the main dome and gave the appearance of a stairway of domes mounting upward. They were purely decorative and were richly decorated with horizontal entablatures and vertical arches, pilasters, and double columns. Even though decoration was the forefront of motivation for the design. The technological advancements of gunpowder and portable cannons required a new system of fortification which led to further development of the double shelled dome. Their architectural elements inspired later High Renaissance architecture, including the Tempietto of St. Peter built at Montorio by Bramante (1502). A similar structure appears the painting of an ideal city attributed to Piero della Francesca at Urbino (about 1475). The new designs fulfilled the need for architectural status for ruling kings and princes with the strong dome structure protecting their interests and bloodline 

==Accomplishments==
===Linear perspective===

Besides his accomplishments in architecture, Brunelleschi is also credited as the first person to describe a precise system of linear perspective. This revolutionized painting opening the way for the naturalistic styles of Renaissance art. He systematically studied how and why objects, buildings, and landscapes changed and lines appeared to change shape when seen from a distance or from different angles. He produced drawings in perspective of the Baptistry in Florence, Place San Giovanni and other Florence landmarks.

According to his early biographers Giorgio Vasari and Antonio Manetti, Brunelleschi conducted experiments between 1415 and 1420, including making paintings with perspectives of the Florence Baptistery and the Palazzo Vecchio, seen obliquely from its northwest corner, as well as the buildings of Place San Giovanni. According to Manetti, he used a grid to guide the drawing of the scene square by square and produced a reverse image. He mathematically calculated a scale for the objects in the drawing to make them appear more accurately, thus discovering a system to represent three dimensional objects on a two-dimensional surface. The results were compositions with accurate perspective, as seen through a mirror. To compare the accuracy of his image with the real object, he made a small hole in his painting, and had an observer look through the back of his painting to observe the scene. A mirror was then raised, reflecting Brunelleschi&#x27;s composition, and the observer saw the striking similarity between the reality and painting. Both panels have since been lost.

Brunelleschi&#x27;s studies on perspective were extended by Leon Battista Alberti, Piero della Francesca and Leonardo da Vinci. Following the rules of perspective studied by Brunelleschi and the others, artists could paint imaginary landscapes and scenes with accurate three-dimensional perspective and realism. The most important treatise on painting of the Renaissance, &quot;Della Pittura libri tre&quot; by Alberti, with a description of Brunelleschi&#x27;s experiment, was published in 1436 and was dedicated to Brunelleschi. This technical innovation by Brunelleschi enabled to reproduce in paintings accurate three-dimensional views of the world. The painting &quot;The Holy Trinity&quot; by Masaccio (1425–1427) in the Santa Maria Novella, Florence, is a renowned example of the new technique, which accurately created the illusion of a three-dimensional representation and also recreated, in painting, Brunelleschi&#x27;s architectural style. This development established the standard method of painting studied by artists until the 19th century.

===An innovative boat===
In 1421, Brunelleschi was granted what is thought to be one of the first modern patents for his invention of a river transport vessel that was said to &quot;bring in any merchandise and load on the river Arno etc for less money than usual, and with several other benefits.&quot; It was intended to be used to transport marble. In the history of patent law, Brunelleschi is, therefore, accorded a special place. In cultural and political terms, the granting of the patent was part of Brunelleschi&#x27;s attempt to operate as a creative and commercial individual outside the constraints of the guilds and their monopolies.

He was also active in shipbuilding. In 1427 he built a large boat named &quot;Il Badalone&quot; to transport marble to Florence from Pisa up the River Arno. The ship sank on its maiden voyage, along with a sizable portion of Brunelleschi&#x27;s personal fortune.

===Other activities===
Brunelleschi&#x27;s interests extended to mathematics and engineering and the study of ancient monuments. He designed hydraulic machinery and elaborate clockworks, none of which survive.

Brunelleschi designed machinery for use in churches during theatrical religious performances that re-enacted Biblical miracle stories. Contrivances were created by which characters and angels were made to fly through the air in the midst of spectacular explosions of light and fireworks. These events took place during state and ecclesiastical visits. It is not known for certain how many of these projects Brunelleschi designed, but at least one, for the church of San Felice, is confirmed in the records.

Brunelleschi also designed fortifications used by Florence in its military confrontations with Pisa and Siena. In 1424, he worked in Lastra a Signa, a village protecting the route to Pisa, and in 1431, in the south of Italy at the walls of the village of Staggia. These walls are still preserved, but their attribution to Brunelleschi is uncertain.

His works involved sometimes urban planning; he strategically positioned several of his buildings in relation to the nearby squares and streets to increase their visibility. For example, demolitions in front of San Lorenzo were approved in 1433 to create a piazza facing the church. At Santo Spirito, he suggested that the façade be turned either towards the Arno so travellers would see it, or to the north, to face a large piazza.

==Personal life==
Brunelleschi did not have children of his own, but in 1415, he adopted Andrea di Lazzaro Cavalcanti, who took the name Il Buggiano, after his birthplace. He was Brunelleschi&#x27;s sole heir.

Brunelleschi was a member of the guild of silk merchants, which included jewelers and goldsmiths, but not of the guild of stone and wood masters, which included architects. In 1434, he was arrested at the request of the guild of masters of stone and wood for practicing his trade illegally. He was quickly released, and the stone and wood masters were charged with false imprisonment.
==Location of remains==

Brunelleschi&#x27;s body lies in the crypt of the Cathedral of Florence. Antonio Manetti, who knew Brunelleschi and wrote his biography that Brunelleschi &quot;was granted such honours as to be buried in the Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore, and with a marble bust, which was said to be carved from life, and placed there in perpetual memory with such a splendid epitaph.&quot; Inside the cathedral entrance is this epitaph: &quot;Both the magnificent dome of this famous church and many other devices invented by Filippo the architect, bear witness to his superb skills. Therefore, in tribute to his exceptional talents, a grateful country that will always remember him buries him here in the soil below.&quot; A statue of Brunelleschi, looking up at his dome, was later placed in the square in front of the cathedral.

Brunelleschi is portrayed by Alessandro Preziosi in the 2016 television series &quot;&quot;.

<text>Creole peoples may refer to various ethnic groups around the world. The term&#x27;s meaning exhibits regional variations, often sparking debate.

Creole peoples represent a diverse array of ethnicities, each possessing a distinct cultural identity that has been shaped over time. The emergence of creole languages, frequently associated with Creole ethnicity, is a separate phenomenon.

In specific historical contexts, particularly during the European colonial era, the term &quot;Creole&quot; applies to ethnicities formed through large-scale population movements. These movements involved people from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds who converged upon newly established colonial territories. Often involuntarily separated from their ancestral homelands, these populations were forced to adapt and create a new way of life. Through a process of cultural amalgamation, they selectively adopted and merged desirable elements from their varied heritages. This resulted in the emergence of novel social norms, languages, and cultural practices that transcended their individual origins.

This process of cultural amalgamation, termed creolization, is characterized by rapid social change that ultimately leads to the formation of a distinct Creole identity.

== Etymology and overview==
The English word creole derives from the French &quot;créole&quot;, which in turn came from Portuguese &quot;crioulo&quot;, a diminutive of &quot;cria&quot; meaning a person raised in one&#x27;s house. &quot;Cria&quot; is derived from &quot;criar&quot;, meaning &quot;to raise or bring up&quot;, itself derived from the Latin &quot;creare&quot;, meaning &quot;to make, bring forth, produce, beget&quot;; which is also the source of the English word &quot;create&quot;. It originally referred to the descendants of European colonists who had been born in the colony. Creole is also known by cognates in other languages, such as &quot;crioulo&quot;, &quot;criollo&quot;, &quot;creolo&quot;, &quot;kriolu&quot;, &quot;criol&quot;, &quot;kreyol&quot;, &quot;kreol&quot;, &quot;kriol&quot;, &quot;krio&quot;, and &quot;kriyoyo&quot;.

In Louisiana, the term Creole has been used since 1792 to represent descendants of African or mixed heritage parents as well as children of French and Spanish descent with no racial mixing. Its use as in the name for languages started from 1879, while as an adjective for languages, its use began around 1748. 

In Spanish-speaking countries, the word &quot;Criollo&quot; refers to the descendants of Europeans born in the Americas, but also in some countries, to describe something local or very typical of a particular Latin American region.

In the Caribbean, the term broadly refers to all the people, whatever their class or ancestry — African, East Asian, European, Indian — who are part of the culture of the Caribbean. In Trinidad, the term Creole is used to designate all Trinidadians except those of Asian origin. In Suriname, the term refers only to the descendants of enslaved Africans and in neighboring French Guiana the term refers to anyone, regardless of skin colour, who has adopted a European lifestyle.

In Africa, the term Creole refers to any ethnic group formed during the European colonial era, with some mix of African and non-African racial or cultural heritage. Creole communities are found on most African islands and along the continent&#x27;s coastal regions where indigenous Africans first interacted with Europeans. As a result of these contacts, five major Creole types emerged in Africa: Portuguese, African American, Dutch, French and British.

The &quot;Crioulos&quot; of African or mixed Portuguese and African descent eventually gave rise to several ethnic groups in Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé e Príncipe, Angola and Mozambique. The French-speaking Mauritian and Seychellois Creoles are both either African or ethnically mixed and Christianized. On Réunion, the term Creole applies to all people born on the island, while in South Africa, the blending of East African and Southeast Asian slaves with Dutch settlers, later produced a creolized population. The Fernandino Creole peoples of Equatorial Guinea are a mix of Afro-Cubans with Emancipados and English-speaking Liberated Africans, while the Americo-Liberians and Sierra Leone Creoles resulted from the intermingling of African Recaptives with Afro-Caribbean people and African Americans.

Perhaps due to the range of divergent descriptions and lack of a coherent definition, Norwegian anthropologist T. H. Eriksen concludes: 

The following ethnic groups have been historically characterized as &quot;Creole&quot; peoples:

* Afro-Brazilian Crioulos
* Aku Krio people
* Atlantic Creoles
* Belizean Kriol people
* Cape Verdeans (Crioulos)
* Criollo people (European diaspora born in the Spanish colonies in the Americas)
* Fernandino Creole peoples
* Haitian Creole people 
** Affranchis
* Afro-Honduran Creoles
* Liberian Creole people
* Louisiana Creole people 
** Creoles of color
* Mauritian Creole people
** also Réunion Creole
* Seychellois Creole people
* Sierra Leone Creole people
* Surinamese Creole people

== United States ==

=== Alaska ===

Alaskan Creole, sometimes colloquially spelled &quot;Kriol&quot; in English (from Russian креол), are a unique people who first came about through the intermingling of Sibero-Russian &quot;promyshlenniki&quot; men with Aleut and Eskimo women in the late 18th century and assumed a prominent position in the economy of Russian America and the North Pacific Rim.

=== Chesapeake Colonies ===
Atlantic Creole is a term coined by historian Ira Berlin to describe a group of people from Angola and Central Africa in the 16th and 17th centuries with cultural or ethnic ties to Africa, Europe, and sometimes the Caribbean. Some of these people arrived in the Chesapeake Colonies as the Charter Generation of slaves during the European colonization of the Americas before 1660. Some had lived and worked in Europe or the Caribbean before coming (or being transported) to North America. Examples of such men included John Punch and Emanuel Driggus (his surname was likely derived from Rodrigues). 
Also, during the early settlement of the colonies, children born of immigrants in the colonies were often referred to as &quot;Creole&quot;. This is found more often in the Chesapeake Colonies.

=== Louisiana ===

In the United States, the words &quot;Louisiana Creole&quot; refers to people of any race or mixture thereof who are descended from colonial French La Louisiane and colonial Spanish Louisiana (New Spain) settlers before the Louisiana region became part of the United States in 1803 with the Louisiana Purchase. Both the word and the ethnic group derive from a similar usage, beginning in the Caribbean in the 16th century, which distinguished people born in the French, Spanish, and Portuguese colonies from the various new arrivals born in their respective, non-Caribbean homelands. Some writers from other parts of the country have mistakenly assumed the term to refer only to people of mixed racial descent, but this is not the traditional Louisiana usage.

In Louisiana, the term &quot;Creole&quot; was first used to describe people born in Louisiana, who used the term to distinguish themselves from newly arrived immigrants. It was not a racial or ethnic identifier; it was simply synonymous with &quot;born in the New World,&quot; meant to separate native-born people of any ethnic background—white, African, or any mixture thereof—from European immigrants and slaves imported from Africa. Later, the term was racialized after newly arrived Anglo-Americans began to associate créolité, or the quality of being Creole, with racially mixed ancestry. This caused many white Creoles to eventually abandon the label out of fear that the term would lead mainstream Americans to believe them to be of racially mixed descent (and thus endanger their livelihoods or social standing). Later writers occasionally make distinctions among French Creoles (of European ancestry), Creoles of Color (of mixed ethnic ancestry), and occasionally, African Creoles (of primarily African descendant); these categories, however, are later inventions, and most primary documents from the eighteenth, nineteenth and early twentieth centuries make use of the word &quot;Creole&quot; without any additional qualifier. Creoles of Spanish and German descent also exist, and Spanish Creoles survive today as Isleños and Malagueños, both found in southern Louisiana. However, all racial categories of Creoles - from Caucasian, mixed racial, African, to Native American - tended to think and refer to themselves solely as Creole, a commonality in many other Francophone and Iberoamerican cultures, who tend to lack strict racial separations common in United States History and other countries with large populations from Northern Europe&#x27;s various cultures. This racial neutrality persists to the modern day, as many Creoles do not use race as a factor for being a part of the ethno-culture.

Contemporary usage has again broadened the meaning of Louisiana Creoles to describe a broad cultural group of people of all races who share a colonial Louisianian background. Louisianians who identify themselves as &quot;Creole&quot; are most commonly from historically Francophone and Hispanic communities. Some of their ancestors came to Louisiana directly from France, Spain, or Germany, while others came via the French and Spanish colonies in the Caribbean and Canada. Many Louisiana Creole families arrived in Louisiana from Saint-Domingue as refugees from the Haitian Revolution, along with other immigrants from Caribbean colonial centers like Santo Domingo and Havana. The children of slaves brought primarily from Western Africa were also considered Creoles, as were children born of unions between Native Americans and non-Natives. Creole culture in Louisiana thus consists of a unique blend of European, Native American, and African cultures.

Louisianians descended from the French Acadians of Canada are also Creoles in a strict sense, and there are many historical examples of people of full European ancestry and with Acadian surnames, such as the influential Alexandre and Alfred Mouton, being explicitly described as &quot;Creoles.&quot; Today, however, the descendants of the Acadians are more commonly referred to as, and identify as, &#x27;Cajuns&#x27;—a derivation of the word Acadian, indicating French Canadian settlers as ancestors. The distinction between &quot;Cajuns&quot; and &quot;Creoles&quot; is stronger today than it was in the past because American racial ideologies have strongly influenced the meaning of the word &quot;Creole&quot; to the extent that there is no longer unanimous agreement among Louisianians on the word&#x27;s precise definition. Today, many assume that any francophone person of European descent is Cajun and any francophone of African descent is Creole—a false assumption that would not have been recognized in the nineteenth century. Some assert that &quot;Creole&quot; refers to aristocratic urbanites whereas &quot;Cajuns&quot; are agrarian members of the francophone working class, but this is another relatively recent distinction. Creoles may be of any race and live in any area, rural or urban. The Creole culture of Southwest Louisiana is thus more similar to the culture dominant in Acadiana than it is to the Creole culture of New Orleans. Though the land areas overlap around New Orleans and down river, Cajun/Creole culture and language extend westward all along the southern coast of Louisiana, concentrating in areas southwest of New Orleans around Lafayette, and as far as Crowley, Abbeville, and into the rice belt of Louisiana nearer Lake Charles and the Texas border.
Louisiana Creoles historically spoke a variety of languages; today, the most prominent include Louisiana French and Louisiana Creole. (There is a distinction between &quot;Creole&quot; people and the &quot;creole&quot; language. Not all Creoles speak creole—many speak French, Spanish, or English as primary languages.) Spoken creole is dying with continued &#x27;Americanization&#x27; in the area. Most remaining Creole lexemes have drifted into popular culture. Traditional creole is spoken among those families determined to keep the language alive or in regions below New Orleans around St. James and St. John Parishes where German immigrants originally settled (also known as &#x27;the German Coast&#x27;, or La Côte des Allemands) and cultivated the land, keeping the ill-equipped French Colonists from starvation during the Colonial Period and adopting commonly spoken French and creole (arriving with the exiles) as a language of trade.
Creoles are largely Roman Catholic and influenced by traditional French and Spanish culture left from the first Colonial Period, officially beginning in 1722 with the arrival of the Ursuline Nuns, who were preceded by another order, the sisters of the Sacred Heart, with whom they lived until their first convent could be built with monies from the French Crown. (Both orders still educate girls in 2010). The &quot;fiery Latin temperament&quot; described by early scholars on New Orleans culture made sweeping generalizations to accommodate Creoles of Spanish heritage as well as the original French. The mixed-race Creoles, descendants of mixing of European colonists, slaves, and Native Americans or sometimes &quot;Gens de Couleur&quot; (free men and women of colour), first appeared during the colonial periods with the arrival of slave populations. Most Creoles, regardless of race, generally consider themselves to share a collective culture. Non-Louisianans often fail to appreciate this and assume that all Creoles are of mixed race, which is historically inaccurate.

Louisiane Creoles were also referred to as &quot;criollos&quot;, a word from the Spanish language meaning &quot;created&quot; and used in the post-French governance period to distinguish the two groups of New Orleans area and down river Creoles. Both mixed race and European Creole groups share many traditions and language, but their socio-economic roots differed in the original period of Louisiana history. Actually, the French word Créole is derived from the Portuguese word &quot;Crioulo&quot;, which described people born in the Americas as opposed to Spain.

The term is often used to mean simply &quot;pertaining to the New Orleans area,&quot; but this, too, is not historically accurate. People all across the Louisiana territory, including the &quot;pays des Illinois,&quot; identified as Creoles, as evidenced by the continued existence of the term &quot;Créole&quot; in the critically endangered Missouri French.

=== Mississippi ===
The Mississippi Gulf Coast region has a significant population of Creoles—especially in Pass Christian, Gulfport, Biloxi, and Pascagoula. A community known as Creoletown is located in Pascagoula, with its history on record. Many in this location are Catholic and have also used the Creole, French. and English languages.

===Texas===
In colonial Texas, the term &quot;Creole&quot; (&quot;criollo&quot;) distinguished old-world Africans and Europeans from their descendants born in the new world, Creoles; they composed the citizen class of New Spain&#x27;s Tejas province.

Texas Creole culture revolved around &quot;&#x27;ranchos&quot; (Creole ranches), attended mostly by &quot;vaqueros&quot; (cowboys) of African, Spaniard, or Mestizo descent, and Tlaxcalan Nahuatl settlers, who established a number of settlements in southeastern Texas and western Louisiana (e.g. Los Adaes).

Black Texas Creoles have been present in Texas ever since the 1600s; they served as soldiers in Spanish garrisons of eastern Texas. Generations of Black Texas Creoles, also known as &quot;Black Tejanos&quot;, played a role in later phases of Texas history: Mexican Texas, Republic of Texas, and American Texas.

== Africa ==
=== Southern Africa ===
Unlike the Americas, the term coloured is preferred in Southern Africa to refer to mixed people of African and European descent. The colonisation of the Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company led to the importation of Indonesian, East African and Southeast Asian slaves, who intermingled with Dutch settlers and the indigenous population leading to the development of a creolized population in the early 1700s. Additionally, Portuguese traders mixed with African communities, in what is now present day Mozambique and Zimbabwe, to create the Prazeros and Luso-Africans, who were loyal to the Portuguese crown and served to advance its interests in southeastern Africa. A legacy of this era are the numerous Portuguese words that have entered Shona, Tsonga and Makonde. Today, mixed race communities exist across the region, notably so in South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe. In colonial era Zambia, the term &quot;Eurafrican&quot; was often used though it has largely fallen out of use in the modern era and is no longer recognized at the national level. Today, South African Coloureds and Cape Malay form the majority of the population in the Western Cape and a plurality in the Northern Cape.

In addition to Coloured people, the term mestiço is used in Angola and Mozambique to refer to mixed race people, who enjoyed a certain privilege during the Portuguese era.

=== West Africa ===
In Sierra Leone, the mingling of newly freed Africans and mixed heritage Nova Scotians and Jamaican Maroons from the Western hemisphere and Liberated Africans - such as the Akan, Igbo people, and Yoruba people - over several generations in the late 18th and early 19th centuries led to the eventual creation of the 
aristocratic ethnic group now known as the &quot;Creoles&quot;. Thoroughly westernized in their manners and bourgeois in their methods, the Creoles established a comfortable dominance in the country through a combination of British colonial favouritism and political and economic activity. Their influence in the modern republic remains considerable, and their language Krio - an English-based creole language - is the lingua franca and de facto national language spoken throughout the country.

The extension of these Sierra Leoneans&#x27; business and religious activities to neighbouring Nigeria in the late 19th and early 20th centuries - where many of them had ancestral ties - subsequently caused the creation of an offshoot in that country, the &quot;Saros&quot;. Now often considered to be part of the wider Yoruba ethnicity, the Saros have been prominent in politics, the law, religion, the arts, and journalism.

=== Portuguese Africa ===

Atlantic Creole is a term coined by historian Ira Berlin to describe a group of people from Angola and Central Africa in the 16th and 17th centuries with cultural or ethnic ties to Africa, Europe, and sometimes the Caribbean. They often had Portuguese names and were sometimes mixed race. Their knowledge of different cultures made them skilled traders and negotiators, but some were enslaved and arrived in the Chesapeake Colonies as the Charter Generation of slaves during the Transatlantic Slave Trade before 1660.

The &quot;Crioulos&quot; of mixed Portuguese and African descent eventually gave rise to several major ethnic groups in Africa, especially in Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé e Príncipe, Equatorial Guinea (especially Annobón Province), Ziguinchor (Casamance), Angola, Mozambique. Only a few of these groups have retained the name &quot;crioulo&quot; or variations of it:

* Cape Verde
: the dominant ethnic group, called &quot;Kriolus&quot; or &quot;Kriols&quot; in the local language; the language itself is also called &quot;Creole&quot;;
* Guinea-Bissau
: &quot;Crioulos&quot;
* São Tomé and Príncipe
: &quot;Crioulos&quot;

===Indian Ocean===


The usage of creole in the islands of the southwest of the Indian Ocean varies according to the island. In Mauritius, Mauritian Creoles will be identified based on both ethnicity and religion. Mauritian Creoles being either people who are of Mauritian ancestry or those who are both racially mixed and Christian. The Mauritian Constitution identifies four communities namely, Hindu, Muslim, Chinese and the General Population. Creoles are included in the General Population category along with white Christians.

The term also indicates the same to the people of Seychelles. On Réunion the term creole applies to all people born on the island.

In all three societies, creole also refers to the new languages derived from French and incorporating other languages.

== Former Spanish colonies ==
In regions that were formerly colonies of Spain, the Spanish word &quot;criollo&quot; (implying &quot;native born&quot;) historically denoted a class in the colonial caste system comprising people born in the colonies with total or mostly European, mainly Spanish, descent. Those with mostly European descent were considered on the basis of their “passing” for white. For example, many castizos could&#x27;ve gotten away with passing as criollo because their features would be strikingly European and so many of them would assume such identity in passing, mainly for economic reasons. &quot;Criollo&quot; came to refer to things distinctive of the region, as it is used today, in expressions such as &quot;comida criolla&quot; (&quot;country&quot; food from the area).

In the latter period of settlement of Latin America called &quot;La Colonia&quot;, the Bourbon Spanish Crown preferred Spanish-born &quot;Peninsulares&quot; (literally &quot;born in the Iberian Peninsula&quot;) over Criollos for the top military, administrative, and religious offices due to the former mismanagement of the colonies on a previous Habsburg era.

In Argentina, in an ambiguous ethnoracial way, &quot;criollo&quot; currently is used for people whose ancestors were already present in the territory in the colonial period, regardless their ethnicity. The exception are dark-skinned African people and current indigenous groups.

The word &quot;criollo&quot; is the origin and cognate of the French word &quot;creole&quot;.

=== Spanish America ===
The racially-based caste system was in force throughout the Spanish viceroyalties in the Americas, since the 16th century. During the early Spanish colonial period the Spaniards had a policy selecting promising assimilationist Indigenous to educate and indoctrinate. They were accepted into the colonial leadership but sometimes remained in Spain. Among the descendants of these assimilated sons of chiefs are the Aztec descended Moctezuma de Tultengo. By the 19th century, this discrimination and the example of the American Revolution and the ideals of the Enlightenment eventually led the Spanish American Criollo elite to rebel against the Spanish rule. With the support of the lower classes, they engaged Spain in the Spanish American wars of independence (1810–1826), which ended with the break-up of the former Spanish Empire in the Americas into a number of independent republics.

=== Spanish Philippines ===

Persons of pure Spanish descent born in the islands of the Spanish Philippines were called Insulares (&quot;islanders&quot;) or Criollos.

Although many of the Spanish Americans in the islands were also persons of pure Spanish descent, they, along with many Mestizos and Castizos from Spanish America living in the East Indies were also classified as &quot;Americanos&quot;.

== Caribbean ==
In many parts of the Southern Caribbean, the term Creole people is used to refer to the mixed-race descendants of Europeans and Africans born in the islands. Over time, there was intermarriage with Amerindians and residents from Asia, the Middle East and Latin America as well. They eventually formed a common culture based on their experience of living together in countries colonized by the French, Spanish, Dutch, and British.

A typical Creole person from the Caribbean has French, Spanish, Portuguese, British, or Dutch ancestry, mixed with sub-Saharan African ethnicities, and sometimes mixed with Native Indigenous peoples of the Americas. As workers from Asia entered the Caribbean, Creole people of colour intermarried with Arabs, Indians, Chinese, Javanese, Filipinos, Koreans, and Hmongs. The latter combinations were especially common in Guadeloupe. The foods and cultures are the result of creolization of these influences.

=== Caribbean Languages ===
&quot;Kreyòl&quot; or &quot;Kwéyòl&quot; or &quot;Patois/Patwa&quot; refers to the French-lexicon Creole languages in the Caribbean, including Antillean French Creole, Haitian Creole, and Trinidadian Creole. Creole also refers to Bajan Creole, Bahamian Creole, Belizean Creole, Guyanese Creole, Jamaican Patois, Tobagonian Creole, Trinidadian Creole and Sranan Tongo (Surinamese Creole), among others.

People speak French-lexicon Antillean Creole in the following islands:
* St. Lucia
* Martinique
* Dominica
* Guadeloupe
* St. Martin
* Saint-Barthélemy
* Trinidad and Tobago
* Grenada

<text>Teays, written Seays until &quot;circa&quot; 1884, is an unincorporated community in Putnam County, West Virginia, United States. The town is centered on the former general store / post office on Teays Lane, which sits across from the site of the Teays railroad depot, which was demolished in the mid-1900s.

Teays is a namesake and part of the census-designated place of Teays Valley, which was in turn named for Thomas Teays, a hunter and trapper who once spent a considerable amount of time in the vicinity.

Geologist William G. Tight (1865–1910) named the preglacial Teays River after Teays, which lies in the &quot;riverless&quot; Teays Valley that once was the bottom of the river.

<doc id="90016" wikidata="Q196164" url="?curid=90016" title="Big Five game">
<text>In Africa, the Big Five game animals are the lion, leopard, rhinoceros, elephant, and African buffalo. The term was coined by big-game hunters to refer to the five most difficult animals in Africa to hunt on foot, but is now more widely used by game viewing tourists and safari tour operators. They are examples of charismatic megafauna, featuring prominently in popular culture, and are among the most famous of Africa&#x27;s large animals. 

The 1990 and later releases of South African rand banknotes feature a different big-five animal on each denomination. Countries where all can be found include Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

==Species==
===Elephant===

The African bush elephant (&quot;Loxodonta africana&quot;) and the African forest elephant (&quot;Loxodonta cyclotis&quot;) are the largest extant land-based animals. Elephants are herbivores with thick, almost hairless skin; a long, flexible, prehensile trunk; upper incisors forming long, curved, ivory tusks; and large, fan-shaped ears. Elephants are difficult to hunt because, despite their large size, they are able to hide in thick bush and are more likely to charge than the other Big Five species. They become aggressive when their young are threatened.

===Rhinoceros===

The black rhinoceros (&quot;Diceros bicornis&quot;) and the white rhinoceros (&quot;Ceratotherium simum&quot;) are large herbivores with two upright horns on their nasal bridge. The black rhino is classified as critically endangered and the white rhino as near threatened, and both are subject to extensive poaching. Among big-five game hunters, the black rhinoceros is more highly prized. The current existing rhinos throughout the savanna are southern white rhinoceros, eastern black rhinoceros, south-western black rhinoceros and south-central black rhinoceros.

===African buffalo===

The African buffalo (&quot;Syncerus caffer&quot;) is a large horned bovid. It is the only animal among the Big Five that is not on the &quot;endangered&quot; or &quot;threatened&quot; list. The Cape buffalo (&quot;Syncerus caffer caffer&quot;) is considered by many to be the most dangerous of any of the Big Five: buffalos have reportedly been known to ambush and attack humans.

===Lion===

The lion (&quot;Panthera leo&quot;) is a large, carnivorous feline found in both Africa and northwestern India. It has a short, tawny coat; a tufted tail; and, in the male, a heavy mane around the neck and shoulders. As a large and charismatic apex predator with cultural significance, lions are among the most popular species to view on safari tours.

===Leopard===

The leopard (&quot;Panthera pardus&quot;) is a large, carnivorous feline. Its fur is generally tawny with dark rosette-shaped markings. The leopard is the most seldom seen of the Big Five because of its nocturnal habits (it is most active between sunset and sunrise, although it may hunt during the day in some areas), and because it is wary of humans and will take flight in the face of danger. Leopards can be located in the grasslands, dense brushes, deserts, and forested areas of African savannas.

==Conservation status==
Africa&#x27;s Big Five have become major concerns for wildlife conservationists in recent years. The African lion and African leopard are both classified as vulnerable. The African savanna elephant is listed as endangered by the IUCN as of 2021. The southern white rhinoceros and African buffalo are classified as near threatened while the black rhinoceros is classified as critically endangered.

<doc id="90021" wikidata="Q3851846" url="?curid=90021" title="Flocking">
<text>Flocking is the behavior exhibited when a group of birds, called a flock, are foraging or in flight. Sheep and goats also exhibit flocking behavior. 

Computer simulations and mathematical models that have been developed to emulate the flocking behaviours of birds can also generally be applied to the &quot;flocking&quot; behaviour of other species. As a result, the term &quot;flocking&quot; is sometimes applied, in computer science, to species other than birds, to mean collective motion by a group of self-propelled entities, a collective animal behaviour exhibited by many living beings such as fish, bacteria, and insects. 

Flocking is considered an emergent behaviour arising from simple rules that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination.

== In nature ==

There are parallels with the shoaling behaviour of fish, the swarming behaviour of insects, and herd behaviour of land animals. During the winter months, starlings are known for aggregating into huge flocks of hundreds to thousands of individuals, murmurations, which when they take flight altogether, render large displays of intriguing swirling patterns in the skies above observers.

Flocking behaviour was simulated on a computer in 1987 by Craig Reynolds with his simulation program, Boids. This program simulates simple agents (boids) that are allowed to move according to a set of basic rules. The result is akin to a flock of birds, a school of fish, or a swarm of insects.

=== Measurement ===
Measurements of bird flocking have been made using high-speed cameras, and a computer analysis has been made to test the simple rules of flocking mentioned below. It is found that they generally hold true in the case of bird flocking, but the long range attraction rule (cohesion) applies to the nearest 5–10 neighbors of the flocking bird and is independent of the distance of these neighbors from the bird. In addition, there is an anisotropy with regard to this cohesive tendency, with more cohesion being exhibited towards neighbors to the sides of the bird, rather than in front or behind. This is likely due to the field of vision of the flying bird being directed to the sides rather than directly forward or backward.

Another recent study is based on an analysis of high speed camera footage of flocks above Rome, and uses a computer model assuming minimal behavioural rules.

== Algorithm ==
=== Rules ===

Basic models of flocking behaviour are controlled by three simple rules:

;Separation
:Avoid crowding neighbours (short range repulsion)
;Alignment 
:Steer towards average heading of neighbours
;Cohesion 
:Steer towards average position of neighbours (long range attraction)

With these three simple rules, the flock moves in an extremely realistic way, creating complex motion and interaction that would be extremely hard to create otherwise.

==== Rule variants ====

The basic model has been extended in several different ways since Reynolds proposed it. For instance, Delgado-Mata et al. extended the basic model to incorporate the effects of fear. Olfaction was used to transmit emotion between animals, through pheromones modelled as particles in a free expansion gas. 

Hartman and Benes introduced a complementary force to the alignment that they call the change of leadership. This steer defines the chance of the bird to become a leader and try to escape.

Hemelrijk and Hildenbrandt used attraction, alignment, and avoidance, and extended this with a number of traits of real starlings: 

* birds fly according to fixed wing aerodynamics, while rolling when turning (thus losing lift); 
* they coordinate with a limited number of interaction neighbours of 7 (like real starlings); 
* they try to stay above a sleeping site (like starlings do at dawn), and when they happen to move outwards from the sleeping site, they return to it by turning; and
* they move at relative fixed speed. 

The authors showed that the specifics of flying behaviour as well as large flock size and low number of interaction partners were essential to the creation of the variable shape of flocks of starlings.

=== Complexity ===
In flocking simulations, there is no central control; each bird behaves autonomously. In other words, each bird has to decide for itself which flocks to consider as its environment. Usually environment is defined as a circle (2D) or sphere (3D) with a certain radius (representing reach).

A basic implementation of a flocking algorithm has complexity formula_1 – each bird searches through all other birds to find those which fall into its environment.

Possible improvements:
* bin-lattice spatial subdivision. The entire area the flock can move in is divided into multiple bins. Each bin stores which birds it contains. Each time a bird moves from one bin to another, lattice has to be updated.
** Example: 2D(3D) grid in a 2D(3D) flocking simulation.
** Complexity: formula_2, k is number of surrounding bins to consider; just when bird&#x27;s bin is found in formula_3

Lee Spector, Jon Klein, Chris Perry and Mark Feinstein studied the emergence of collective behaviour in evolutionary computation systems.

Bernard Chazelle proved that under the assumption that each bird adjusts its velocity and position to the other birds within a fixed radius, the time it takes to converge to a steady state is an iterated exponential of height logarithmic in the number of birds. This means that if the number of birds is large enough, the convergence time will be so great that it might as well be infinite. This result applies only to convergence to a steady state. For example, arrows fired into the air at the edge of a flock will cause the whole flock to react more rapidly than can be explained by interactions with neighbors, which are slowed down by the time delay in the bird&#x27;s central nervous systems—bird-to-bird-to-bird.

==Applications==
In Cologne, Germany, two biologists from the University of Leeds demonstrated a flock-like behaviour in humans. The group of people exhibited a very similar behavioural pattern to that of a flock, where if 5% of the flock would change direction the others would follow suit. When one person was designated as a predator and everyone else was to avoid him, the flock behaved very much like a school of fish.

Flocking has also been considered as a means of controlling the behaviour of Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs).

Flocking is a common technology in screensavers, and has found its use in animation. Flocking has been used in many films to generate crowds which move more realistically. 
Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992) featured flocking bats.

Flocking behaviour has been used for other interesting applications. It has been applied to automatically program Internet multi-channel radio stations.
It has also been used for visualizing information
and for optimization tasks.

<text>Regeneration is a historical and anti-war novel by Pat Barker, first published in 1991. The novel was a Booker Prize nominee and was described by the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; as one of the four best novels of the year in its year of publication. It is the first book in the &quot;Regeneration Trilogy&quot; of novels on the First World War, being followed by &quot;The Eye in the Door&quot; in 1993, and then &quot;The Ghost Road&quot;, which won the Booker Prize in 1995. 

The novel explores the experience of British army officers being treated for shell shock during World War I at Craiglockhart War Hospital in south-west Edinburgh. Inspired by her grandfather&#x27;s experience of World War I, Barker draws extensively on first person narratives from the period. Using these sources, she created characters based on historical individuals present at the hospital including poets and patients, Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, and psychiatrist W.H.R. Rivers, who pioneered treatments of post-traumatic stress disorder during and after World War I. The title of the novel refers to Rivers&#x27; research into &quot;nerve regeneration&quot;. Barker also includes fictional characters, based on the larger cultural experience of the period, including an officer who grew up in the lower classes, Billy Prior, and his girlfriend and munitions worker, Sarah Lumb.

The novel is thematically complex, exploring the effect of the War on identity, masculinity, and social structure. Moreover, the novel draws extensively on period psychological practices, emphasising Rivers&#x27;s research as well as Freudian psychology. Through the novel Barker enters a particular tradition of representing the experience of World War I in literature: many critics compare the novel to other World War I novels, especially those written by women writers interested in the domestic repercussions of the war, including Rebecca West&#x27;s &quot;The Return of the Soldier&quot; (1918) and Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; (1925). Barker both drew on those texts of the period that initially inspired her and makes references to a number of other literary and cultural works and events. These give an impression of historical realism, even though Barker tends to refute the claim that the novel is &quot;historical fiction&quot;.

In 1997, the novel was adapted by Scottish screenwriter Allan Scott into a film of the same name directed by Gillies MacKinnon and starring Jonathan Pryce as Rivers, James Wilby as Sassoon, and Jonny Lee Miller as Prior. The film was highly critically acclaimed and successful in the UK and Canada, receiving nominations for a number of awards, but failed to get the marketing and distribution in the US, so made little impact.

==Background and inspiration==
Barker had long appreciated the literary figures she draws inspiration from in the novel: in her youth, she read the World War I poetry of Sassoon and Owen, as well as Rivers&#x27;s &quot;Conflict and Dream&quot;. However, Barker directly attributes the immediate inspiration for &quot;Regeneration&quot; to her husband, a neurologist familiar with the writings of Dr. W.H.R. Rivers and his experiments with nerve regeneration. In a 2004 interview with literary critic Rob Nixon in the journal &quot;Contemporary Literature&quot;, Barker also states she wrote the novel, in part, as a response to how her earlier fiction was being received; she said, 

Other interviews also emphasise her memories of her grandfather&#x27;s stories about his experience.

In her &quot;Author&#x27;s Note&quot; for the novel, she describes the research which she used to create the novel, and how she drew on a number of sources from different period authors. The novel draws considerable inspiration from historical events. Literary critic Greg Harris describes her use of historical circumstances and historical source materials as largely, &quot; &quot;true&quot; to the extent that the lives of the real-life characters, including Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, and Robert Graves, did intertwine.&quot; Moreover, Harris argues that Barker accurately captures the psychological situation in which the characters, especially the literary characters, were producing their poetry. French literary critic Marie-Noëlle Provost-Vallet highlights different misinterpretations and anachronistic cultural references supporting a critique of the novel by blogger and critic Esther MacCallum-Stewart. However, she also notes the novel accurately assesses other parts of the historical context, such as the treatment of the World War I poets&#x27; and their poetic process.

==Genre==
The novel has been treated both as a war novel and an anti-war novel. In her 2004 interview with critic Rob Nixon, Barker describes her conceptualisation of that boundary: 

Moreover, because of the novel&#x27;s strict adherence to history, critic Greg Harris describes the novel pushing the boundaries between historical fiction and non-fiction. In her study of the novel, Karin Westman describes the act of writing historical fiction as &quot;a challenge&quot; for Barker. Westman notes that Barker, at times, made deliberate choices not to preserve realism, when, for example, she omits the kinds of language and humour used by soldiers during the period. In some interviews, Barker directly challenges the characterisation of the novel as an &quot;historical novel,&quot; suggesting that the First World War stands in for other wars and allows her to represent more unspecific war-related themes.
==Plot summary==

===Part I===
The novel begins as Dr W. H. R. Rivers, an army psychiatrist at Craiglockhart War Hospital, learns of poet Siegfried Sassoon&#x27;s declaration against the continuation of the war. A government board influenced by Sassoon&#x27;s friend Robert Graves labels Sassoon as &quot;shell-shocked&quot; and sends him to the hospital in an effort to discredit him. Rivers feels uneasy about Sassoon entering Craiglockhart, doubting that he is shell-shocked and not wanting to shelter a conscientious objector. Soon after Sassoon arrives, Rivers meets him and they discuss why Sassoon objects to the war: he objects to its horrors, out of no particular religious belief, a common criterion for conscientious objectors. Though troubled by these horrors, Rivers affirms his duty to return Sassoon to combat. Sassoon feels conflicted about his safety at Craiglockhart while others die on the Western Front.

In addition to Sassoon&#x27;s conflict, the opening chapters of the novel describe the suffering of other soldiers in the hospital. Anderson, a former surgeon, now cannot stand the sight of blood. Haunted by terrible hallucinations after being thrown into the air by an explosion and landing head first in the ruptured stomach of a rotting dead soldier, Burns experiences a revulsion to eating. Another patient, Billy Prior, suffers from mutism and will only write communications with Rivers on a notepad. Prior eventually regains his voice, but remains a difficult patient for Rivers avoiding any discussion of his war memories.

===Part II===

At the beginning of Part II, Sassoon meets the young aspiring poet Wilfred Owen who admires Sassoon&#x27;s poetry and Sassoon helps workshop Owen&#x27;s poem &quot;The Dead-Beat&quot;. Sassoon becomes Anderson&#x27;s golf partner. On a day off, Prior goes into Edinburgh and meets Sarah Lumb, a munitionette whose boyfriend was killed at the Battle of Loos. They nearly have sex, but Sarah refuses Prior at the last minute. The doctors punish Prior for being gone from Craiglockhart for too long, confining him there for two weeks. During that time, Rivers tries hypnosis on Prior to help him recover his memories of the trenches.

Meanwhile, Rivers invites Sassoon to visit the Conservative Club. At the lunch, Rivers realises it will be difficult to convince Sassoon to return to the war and does not want to force him. Later, Owen convinces Sassoon to publish his poetry in the hospital magazine &quot;The Hydra&quot;. During this time, Prior meets Sarah in town and explains why he missed their meetings. Reconciled, they take a train to the seaside and walk along the beach together, where he feels relieved, though he is distracted thinking about the plight of fellow soldiers. Caught in a storm, he and Sarah have sex while sheltering in a bush. Meanwhile, Rivers, exhausted by the taxing work of caring for the shell shocked soldiers, is ordered by his superiors to holiday for three weeks away from Craiglockhart. Rivers&#x27; departure resurrects Sassoon&#x27;s feelings of abandonment when his father left him, and he realises that Rivers has taken the place of his father.

===Part III===

While away from Craiglockhart, Rivers attends church near his brother&#x27;s farm and reflects on the sacrifices of younger men in the war for the desires of the older generation. Afterward, tiring labour on his brother&#x27;s farm allows a cathartic release and a thorough reflection on his experiences. During one flashback, Rivers reflects on his father&#x27;s role in his life, remembering his father&#x27;s speech therapy practice on both himself and Charles Dodgson, who was later known by his pen name Lewis Carroll. At Craiglockhart, Sassoon helps Owen draft one of his most famous poems, &quot;Anthem for Doomed Youth.&quot;

Meanwhile, Sarah accompanies her friend Madge to a local wounded soldier hospital. Sarah gets separated and walks into a tent housing amputee soldiers. She feels shocked that society hides these injured soldiers away. During Sarah&#x27;s experience, Prior is examined by a medical board. Prior fears that they suspect he is faking illness and want to send him back to war. While away, Rivers meets with some old friends, Ruth and Henry Head, who discuss Sassoon. Rivers suggests that Sassoon has the freedom to disagree with the war. However, Rivers affirms that his job is to make Sassoon return to military duty. At the end of their conversation Head offers Rivers a job in London, which Rivers is unsure if he should take out of fear of not fulfilling his duties.

Burns, who has since been discharged from hospital, invites Rivers to visit him at his family home in seaside Suffolk. Rivers finds Burns alone. They spend a few days together. One night, during a severe thunderstorm, Burns walks outside and suffers flashbacks to his experiences with trench warfare in France. The trauma facilitates Burns&#x27; ability to talk about his frontline experience. The experience also helps Rivers decide to take the job in London, and notifies his commander at Craiglockhart. When Rivers returns, Sassoon describes his recent hallucinations of dead friends knocking on his door. Sassoon admits to guilt for not serving the soldiers and decides to return to the trenches. Rivers, though pleased with Sassoon&#x27;s decision, worries about what may happen to him there.

===Part IV===
Starting the section, Sarah tells her mother, Ada, about her relationship with Billy Prior. Ada scolds her daughter for having sex outside marriage. A few chapters later, Sarah discovers that another munitions worker attempted a home abortion with a coat-hanger, but only harms herself. Meanwhile, Sassoon tells Graves of his decision to return to war. In the same conversation, Graves stresses his heterosexuality, leaving Sassoon feeling of unease about his own sexual orientation. During a counselling session Sassoon talks to Rivers about the official attitude towards homosexuality. Rivers theorises that during wartime the authorities are particularly hard on homosexuality, wanting to clearly distinguish between the &quot;right&quot; kind of love between men (loyalty, brotherhood, camaraderie), which is beneficial to soldiers, and the &quot;wrong&quot; kind (sexual attraction).

Soon, the medical board review the soldiers&#x27; cases deciding on their fitness for combat. Prior receives permanent home service due to his asthma. Prior breaks down, fearing that he will be seen as a coward. Sassoon, tired of waiting for his board, leaves the hospital to dine with a friends, causing conflict with Rivers. Following the medical board, Prior and Sarah meet again and admit their love. Sassoon and Owen discuss Sassoon&#x27;s imminent departure and Owen is deeply affected. Sassoon comments to Rivers that Owen&#x27;s feelings may be more than mere hero worship.

Rivers spends his last day at the clinic saying goodbye to his patients, then travels to London and meets Dr. Lewis Yealland from the National Hospital, who will be his colleague in his new position. Dr. Yealland uses electro-shock therapy to force patients to quickly recover from shell-shock; he believes that some patients do not want to be cured and that pain is the best method of treatment for such reluctant patients. Rivers questions whether he can work with a man who uses such techniques. Soon Sassoon is released for combat duty; Willard is able to overcome his psychosomatic paralysis and walks again; Anderson is given a staff job. The novel ends with Rivers completing his notes, meditating on the effect that the encounter with Sassoon, and the last few months, have had on him.
==Characters==

Siegfried Sassoon – The fictional Siegfried Sassoon is closely based on the real Sassoon. Many reviewers of the novel describe Sassoon as the main character. Abandoned by his father as a child, the novel presents Rivers as a father-figure for Sassoon, which reflects their historical relationship. Despite Sassoon&#x27;s decorated military career, his experiences in World War I caused him to publish an anti-war declaration. Although the character in &quot;Regeneration&quot; eventually returns to the front (as did the historical Sassoon), Barker depicts him as remaining deeply ambivalent about warfare. Moreover, Sassoon held ambiguous feelings about his sexuality throughout his life: though he married Hester Gatty in 1933, he had several homosexual affairs after the war.

Dr. W.H.R. Rivers – Based upon the real-life W. H. R. Rivers, Rivers is an English anthropologist, neurologist, and psychiatrist who worked at Craiglockhart War Hospital between 1916 and 1917, his patients included Siegfried Sassoon amongst other literary figures. Barker describes him as the main character of the novel (though some critics emphasise Rivers or Sassoon). Historically, he experimented with treatments for nerve regeneration with Henry Head. This research inspired the title of the novel as well as some of the trilogy&#x27;s major themes, such as trauma, injury, and healing. In Barker&#x27;s portrayal, Rivers suffers throughout the novel from the moral dilemma that he is treating soldiers in order that they can return to war. His approach is contrasted with the harsh treatment used by Dr. Lewis Yealland. Moreover, throughout the novel Rivers is struggling with a nervous stammer he has had since childhood, even though his own father used to be a speech therapist. In an interview with journalist Wera Reusch, Barker called the historical Rivers &quot;very humane, a very compassionate person who was tormented really by the suffering he saw, and very sceptical about the war, but at the same time he didn&#x27;t feel he could go the whole way and say no, stop.&quot;

Billy Prior – Prior is one of the few purely fictional characters in the book. Prior is a soldier at Craiglockhart who suffers from mutism and asthma. According to critic Patricia Johnson, Prior&#x27;s inability to speak highlights the novel&#x27;s treatment of Western culture&#x27;s inability to verbalise the mutilation of bodies caused by war. Prior is a working-class officer who has risen to the rank of lieutenant despite his background. Straddling the class divide, Prior sees the British army mirroring the class system, even in the trenches. Prior often envies those who are not involved in the war experience, such as Sarah, his love interest in the novel. As he develops in the &quot;Regeneration Trilogy&quot;, the novels reveal Prior as bisexual. He is a man fundamentally at war with himself: torn between his working-class roots and his army career, between his officially acknowledged love for Sarah and his &quot;forbidden&quot; sexual attraction towards other men, between his violent father and his fussing mother, his longing for peace and his hatred of civilians unaffected by the horrors of trench warfare.

David Burns – David Burns, another patient at Craiglockhart War Hospital, is a fictionalised version of one of Rivers&#x27; real patients who is described in the psychologist&#x27;s case studies. Burns has been unable to eat after a bomb explosion threw him headlong into the gas-filled belly of a corpse, which caused him to swallow some of the rotting flesh. Critic Patricia Johnson explains that this experience of traumatic embodied experiences, epitomises the novel&#x27;s strong use of visual descriptions of the war to help the reader recognise wars horrors (see the War themes section below).
Wilfred Owen – The fictional Owen is based upon the actual poet who died just before the end of the war in 1918. His posthumously published poems greatly increased his reputation. He is largely a peripheral character in the novel. Barker depicts Owen as initially unsure of the standard of his own poetry and asks Sassoon to help him revise them. These unrevised versions of the poems are not drafts originally by Owen, but rather versions of the poems revised by Barker. Owen&#x27;s sexuality is also questioned, as Sassoon comments that Owen&#x27;s feelings towards him seem to extend further than mere hero-worship.

Anderson – Anderson is another patient at Craiglockhart War hospital. Once a surgeon, Anderson&#x27;s experiences of war have made it impossible to continue practising medicine because he now hates the sight of blood after experiencing a mental breakdown.

Sarah Lumb – Sarah is a completely fictional character. The girlfriend of the character Billy Prior, she is working-class, &quot;Geordie,&quot; and works in a munitions factory in Scotland producing armaments for British soldiers. Ada Lumb, her mother, appears briefly and has a hardened attitude towards love and relationships.

Dr. Lewis Yealland – A foil to Rivers, Yealland is based on a doctor of that name at the National Hospital in London who used electro-shock therapy to treat his patients. Yealland is portrayed as arrogant and uncaring. He believes that the characters that breakdown during the war are &quot;weak&quot; and says that they would break down in civilian life anyway.

Callan – Callan is a patient of Dr. Yealland who has served in every major battle in World War I. He finds himself in the care of Dr. Yealland after suffering from mutism. Callan tries to fight against his doctor&#x27;s treatment but eventually gives in to it.

Robert Graves – Another real life character, Graves is a fellow poet and friend of Sassoon who sees the war as unjust and immoral. However, Graves does not want to make his life more difficult by protesting. Graves sees it as his duty to serve his country regardless of his own moral beliefs.

==Major themes==
Because &quot;Regeneration&quot; is a novel that focuses on the First World War, it explores many of the themes common to literature written during and following the war, including the cause and effects of war, the limits of ideologies like nationalism and masculinity, and both the medical and popular reactions to the psychological traumas created in the war. Critics have treated each of these extensively. Moreover, because much of Barker&#x27;s earlier work was historical fiction about women, critics often comment on her treatment of women in the novel.

===War===

The novel extensively focuses on the effects of losses during wartime. As &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted when discussing her awards for &quot;The Ghost Road&quot;, the series gave her the reputation as &quot;The woman who understood war&quot;. Barker stated in an interview with Wera Reusch that &quot;The trilogy is trying to tell something about the parts of war that don&#x27;t get into the official accounts&quot;. She goes on to state that &quot;One of the things that impresses me is that two things happen to soldiers in war: a) they get killed or b) they come back more or less alright. It&#x27;s really focusing on the people who do come back but don&#x27;t come back alright, they are either physically disabled or mentally traumatised.&quot;

One of the focuses of the novel is on how combatants perceive their experiences. In her article discussing the novel&#x27;s representation of death, literary critic Patricia E. Johnson describes how contemporary society tends to make the casualties and experience of war more abstract, making it hard for non-combatants to imagine the losses. Johnson argues that the entire &quot;Regeneration Trilogy&quot; breaks the boundaries created by modern society&#x27;s abstraction of war and its casualties because &quot;mutilation and death are re-presented in a ways that escape warfare&#x27;s typical conceptual categories, thus ...&quot;realising&quot; modern warfare by reconnecting language and material substance.&quot; In discussing the first novel specifically, Johnson highlights how the book &quot;repeatedly employs synecdoche&quot; to emphasise the visceral experiences, by describing eviscerated human flesh and how the characters respond to those experiences. She describes experiences like Burns&#x27;s horrifying head first disembowelment of a corpse as allowing the readers to understand two things: first, that memories of the combatants are recorded in terms of their relationship to actual people, rather than in the vague ideas of people represented by war memorials; and second, the conceptual opposition in Western culture between flesh or body parts and the social definition of a person (for further discussion of this philosophical issue see Mind-body problem).

===Ideology===
Much of the novel explores the types of cultural ideologies, like nationalism and masculinity, that facilitated the War. Barker states that she chose to write about World War I &quot;because it&#x27;s come to stand in for other wars, as a sort of idealism of the young people in August 1914 in Germany and in England. They really felt this was the start of a better world. And the disillusionment, the horror and the pain followed that. I think because of that it&#x27;s come to stand for the pain of all wars.&quot; Critic Kaley Joyes argues that choices like the inclusion of the work by poet Wilfred Owen in the novel, whose life has been romanticised as &quot;an expressive exemplar of the war&#x27;s tragic losses,&quot; highlights this thematic interest in breaking down the common ideological interpretations of the war.
====Masculinity====
The tension between traditional models of masculinity and the experiences within the war runs throughout the novel. Critic Greg Harris identifies &quot;Regeneration&quot;, along with the other two novels in the trilogy, as profiling the non-fictional experience of Sassoon and other soldiers who must deal with ideas of masculnity. These characters feel conflicted by a model of masculinity common to Britain during this time: honour, bravery, mental strength, and confidence were privileged &quot;manly&quot; characteristics. Yet they explore, internally and through conversation, what that model means for them and how the war changes how they should experience it. In an interview with Barker in &quot;Contemporary Literature&quot;, Rob Nixon distinguishes between these ideas of &quot;manliness&quot; and the concept of masculinity as providing a larger definition for identity. Barker agrees with his assessment, saying, &quot;and what&#x27;s so nice about them is that they use it so unself-consciously: they must have been the last generation of men who could talk about manliness without going &quot;ugh&quot; inside.&quot;

In his discussion of the novel, Harris describes this &quot;manliness&quot; as becoming, for Barker&#x27;s characters, an &quot;unrealistic militaristic-masculine ideals&quot;; practices such as the deliberate repression of emotion consume the novel&#x27;s characters and create psychological instability, as well as being the cause of extensive discrimination during the war. Harris highlights how this thematic treatment fairly represents how the question of masculine identity effected Sassoon and other shell-shocked World War I soldiers. Harris also describes Barker, as author, and Rivers, as a period innovator, demonstrating how the use of therapy on soldiers offers an opportunity to shape and rethink this model of masculinity. The idea of reintegrating emotions, in relation to questions about the nature of masculinity, are an important part of the novel; Barker focuses on the same type of emotional reintegration that historians have identified in River&#x27;s actual methods for treating victims of the war.

===Psychology and trauma===
The novel&#x27;s use of a mental hospital as the main setting, along with psychologist Rivers&#x27; treatments of soldiers and their war trauma, focuses much of the novel on the psychological effects of war. In doing so, the novel follows in the tradition of novels like &quot;The Return of the Soldier&quot; (1918) and &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; (1925). Many critics focus on this interest in the effects of trauma. For instance, Ankhi Mukherjee describes the failure of characters to turn their memories into a narrative through the medium of talk therapy. Mukherjee describes River&#x27;s approach to therapy as &quot;autogenesis,&quot; or self-understanding through structuring their reaction to traumatic experiences.

Sigmund Freud is an important influence on the novel&#x27;s approach to psychology, and this influence has roots in the historical context of the novel, because Rivers was influenced by the writings of Freud on neurosis and Sassoon wrote about the experience of Freudian psychoanalysis in his &quot;Sherston&#x27;s Progress&quot;. While Rivers disagreed that neurosis was due to sexual factors he considered Freud&#x27;s work to be of &quot;direct practical use in diagnosis and treatment&quot;. Craiglockhart&#x27;s approach to compassionate talk therapy had roots in the Freudian treatments of hysteria, using tools such as expressing compassionate understanding for patients and helping patients interpret dreams.

===Women and the domestic===

Some critics have written extensively on the place of women within the novel, even though it focuses on men. In part this is because Barker&#x27;s previous novels focus on working-class women&#x27;s history. In her companion to the novel, Karin Westman sees the novel as a response by Barker to critics stereotyping her as only being interested in writing about women. However, Baker has repeatedly talked about how this novel as connected with her earlier interests in feminism. Barker describes the novel as providing a voice for the home front, stating, that &quot;In a lot of books about war by men the women are totally silenced. The men go off and fight and the women stay at home and cry; basically, this is the typical feature. And the women in the trilogy are always deeply significant, and whatever they say in whatever language they say it in, it is always meant to be listened to very carefully.&quot; In particular, Barker is interested in the contradictions placed on women&#x27;s expectations during war period, and its history; for example, she points out that the women in the munitions factories are expected to produce weapons to kill thousands, but a woman who attempts to abort her unborn child is criticised.

The female perspectives within the novel is rare in war fiction and provides a larger sense of the domestic repercussions. Critic Ronald Paul notes that &quot;Regeneration&quot; and its sequels are some of the first novels since Rebecca&#x27;s West&#x27;s &quot;The Return of the Soldier&quot; or Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; that deal with the repercussions of the war and whose author was not a male soldier. Paul describes such novels, which deal explicitly with domestic effects of shell shock, as part of Barker&#x27;s self-described &quot;very much female view of war&quot;.

==Intertextuality==
The novel, like its two sequels, relies heavily on allusion to, and appropriation of, both historical and literary texts. The &quot;Author&#x27;s note&quot; for each novel, as critic Allistair M. Duckworth points out, explicitly outlines historical texts that Barker relied on when writing that novel. Critic Kaley Joyes describes much of the novel&#x27;s reading experience as dependent on knowledge of the other texts. Not all the texts represented in the novel are exact copies. Joyes highlights how Barker alters Wilfred Owen&#x27;s poems so that the reader can witness Owen and Sassoon revise them at Craiglockhart. Joyes argues the subtle use of intertextuality with Owen&#x27;s works as well as other texts allows Barker to engage politically in a metatextual move similar to those identified by Linda Hutcheon in her &quot;A Poetics of Postmodernism&quot; in which Hutcheon describes how fictional texts can question the nature of the historical process, alongside other forms of knowledge, through the means of both explicit and implicit commentary on the construction of that knowledge. According to Joyes, Barker&#x27;s revisions &quot;destabilize eyewitness privilege and emphasizes narration&#x27;s accessibility.&quot;

The following are some of the most prominent intertextual components in the novel:

*Part of Barker&#x27;s primary inspiration for the novel are the accounts of the time Sassoon spent at Craiglockhart, as described by Rivers in his book &quot;Conflict and Dreams&quot;. To give anonymity to Sassoon Rivers refers to him as &quot;Patient B&quot;.
*Sassoon refers to Edward Carpenter&#x27;s writing on sexuality &quot;The Intermediate Sex&quot;, and it is implied that Sassoon is a homosexual because he states that such works made him feel normal about his sexuality.
*The women in the bar, including Sarah Lumb, are based on characters from a scene in &quot;T. S. Eliot&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;.
*Prior reads one of River&#x27;s anthropological studies &quot;The Todas&quot;.
*Owen and Sassoon frequently discuss Craiglockhart&#x27;s in-house publication &quot;The Hydra&quot;, which published some of their poems. 
*A number of Wilfred Owen&#x27;s poems are in the text. Owen and Sassoon are shown working on Owen&#x27;s famous poem &quot;Anthem for Doomed Youth&quot; together. Barker also revises Owen&#x27;s &quot;The Dead-Beat&quot; as well as using &quot;The Parable of the Old Man and the Young&quot; and &quot;Disabled&quot;, but, according to critic Kaley Joyes, she does this &quot;without drawing attention to her intertextual actions.&quot; According to Joyes, Barker describes Owen&#x27;s as often received as an &quot; iconic status as an expressive exemplar of the war&#x27;s tragic losses&quot;. Joyes posits that Barkers&#x27; subtle uses of some of Owen&#x27;s poems may be an attempt for circumventing the &quot;preexisting myth&quot; about him and his work.
*Literary critic Alistair M. Duckworth describes the novel building on narratives and thematic elements found in both Robert Graves&#x27;s &quot;Good-Bye to All That&quot; (1929) and Edmund Blunden&#x27;s &quot;Undertones of War&quot; (1928).

==Reception and sales==

On 5 November 2019, the &quot;BBC News&quot; listed &quot;Regeneration&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels. According to academic critic Karin Westman, &quot;Regeneration&quot; was &quot;well received by reviewers in both the UK and the United States.&quot; Beyond frequent praise, the main points discussed often related to the veracity of Barker&#x27;s depiction of the War period and about her role as a woman writer, along with the connections of this work to her previous novels. Westman argues that many of these critics judged Barker&#x27;s work on &quot;content rather than style&quot;, so that this work allowed her to break from her earlier classification as a regional, working-class feminist into the &quot;(male) canon of British literature&quot;. The novel was even one of the &quot;best novels of 1992&quot;, according to the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

Writing in 2001, Westman describes the novel selling well in the ten years since its publication. She also notes that the novel&#x27;s success was likely due to an increased interest in &quot;remembrance&quot; of the Great War, the success of the subsequent novels in the trilogy, and its appeal to a wide variety of readers. Subsequently, the 1997 film adaptation also succeeded in the United Kingdom and Canada receiving several rewards. However, the film was not successful in the United States and Westman attributes this to poor timing and a small distribution.

<text>Flirting with Disaster is a 1996 American black comedy film written and directed by David O. Russell about a young father&#x27;s search for his biological parents. It stars Ben Stiller, Patricia Arquette, Téa Leoni, Alan Alda, Mary Tyler Moore, George Segal, Lily Tomlin and Richard Jenkins. It was screened out of competition in the Special Screenings section at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival.

==Plot==
Mel Coplin and his wife, Nancy, live in New York, near Mel&#x27;s neurotic, Jewish, adoptive parents, Ed and Pearl Coplin. Mel and Nancy have just had their first child, and Mel won&#x27;t decide on a name for their son until he can discover the identity of his biological parents. When Tina Kelb, an adoption agency employee, locates his biological mother&#x27;s name in a database, Mel decides to meet his mother personally.

The sexy but highly incompetent Tina decides to accompany Mel, Nancy, and the newborn on a trip to San Diego to meet Mel&#x27;s biological mother. The trip does not go as planned, and ends up becoming a tour of the United States.

In San Diego, Mel is introduced to Valerie, a blonde Scandinavian woman with Confederate roots whose twin daughters are a head taller than Mel. They realize that Valerie is not Mel&#x27;s biological mother, and Tina scrambles to get the correct information from the agency database. Meanwhile, Nancy becomes jealous as Tina and Mel begin to flirt.

The group heads to Battle Creek, Michigan, with the hope of meeting the man whose name appears as the person who delivered infant Mel to the adoption agency. The man, Fritz Boudreau, turns out to be a trucker with a violent streak. However, when he discovers that Mel might be his son, he becomes instantly friendly and lets Mel drive his semi-trailer truck, which Mel immediately crashes into a Post Office building.

This leads to a run-in with two ATF agents, Tony and Paul, who are in a relationship. It is discovered that Tony and Nancy went to high school together. Charges are dismissed, and Fritz tells Mel that he is not Mel&#x27;s father, but only handled Mel&#x27;s adoption because Mel&#x27;s biological parents were indisposed. Tina locates the current address of Mel&#x27;s biological parents, in rural New Mexico. Tony and Paul surprise everyone by deciding to tag along.

While Mel and Tina become close, Nancy finds herself flirting with Tony, who returns the compliment, causing friction. The trip through rural New Mexico is fraught with more problems. The whole crowd finally descends on the front porch of Mel&#x27;s true biological parents, Richard and Mary Schlichting. They are asked to stay the night.

While Richard and Mary are more than welcoming, Mel&#x27;s biological brother Lonnie is overly rude and jealous. It is during dinner that Mel discovers that Richard and Mary had to let Mel be adopted because they were in jail for making and distributing LSD ( acid) in the late 1960s. Not only that, but Richard and Mary continue to manufacture the drug, as becomes apparent when Lonnie, in an attempt to dose Mel with acid at dinner, accidentally doses Paul. Mel retires to Tina&#x27;s bedroom, while Nancy and Tony share a room; neither couple is truly comfortable, leading to Nancy and Mel spending the night reconciling their issues.

While the others are upstairs, the drugged Paul tries to arrest Richard and Mary, but Lonnie knocks him out with a frying pan. The three Schlichtings attempt to escape and decide to take Mel&#x27;s car, hiding their supply of acid in the trunk. Ed and Pearl unexpectedly arrive, in their identical car, but then change their minds and decide to leave, taking the wrong car. When they change their minds again and make a blind U-turn on the nearly deserted highway, Mel&#x27;s two sets of parents crash. Ed and Pearl are arrested while the Schlichtings escape to Mexico.

As morning arrives, not realizing what has happened, Mel and Nancy agree to name the baby Garcia, after Jerry Garcia. Called to the Sheriff&#x27;s office to bail out Ed and Pearl, Mel refers to them as his parents, which they are surprised and happy to hear. Paul, Tony and Tina arrive, with Paul explaining the situation and getting Ed and Pearl released.

A montage of each family&#x27;s personal relationshipsMel and Nancy, Paul and Tony and their Tina-arranged adopted baby, Ed and Pearl, the three Schlichtings, and a very pregnant Tinacontinues over the credits. Each family still have their troubles, but Mel and Nancy are happy together.

<text>Nefertiti () () was a queen of the 18th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, the great royal wife of Pharaoh Akhenaten. Nefertiti and her husband were known for their radical overhaul of state religious policy, in which they promoted the earliest known form of monotheism, Atenism, centered on the sun disc and its direct connection to the royal household. With her husband, she reigned at what was arguably the wealthiest period of ancient Egyptian history. After her husband&#x27;s death, some scholars believe that Nefertiti ruled briefly as the female pharaoh known by the throne name, Neferneferuaten and before the ascension of Tutankhamun, although this identification is a matter of ongoing debate. If Nefertiti did rule as pharaoh, her reign was marked by the fall of Amarna and relocation of the capital back to the traditional city of Thebes.

In the 20th century, Nefertiti was made famous by the discovery and display of her ancient bust, now in Berlin&#x27;s Neues Museum. The bust is one of the most copied works of the art of ancient Egypt. It is attributed to the Egyptian sculptor Thutmose, and was excavated from his buried studio complex in the early 20th century.

== Names and titles ==
Nefertiti had many titles, including: 
* Neferneferuaten (Beautiful is the beauty of Aten) 
* Hereditary Princess (iryt-p`t)
* Great of Praises (wrt-Hzwt)
* Lady of Grace (nebet-imat, -)
* Sweet of Love (beneret-merut, -)
* Lady of The Two Lands (nebet-tawi, -)
* Main King&#x27;s Wife, his beloved (hemet-nesut-aat meretef, - )
* Great King&#x27;s Wife, his beloved (hemet-nesut-weret meretef, )
* Lady of All Women (henut-hemut-nebut, --nbwt)
* Mistress of Upper &amp; Lower Egypt (henut-shemau-mehu, -šmꜣw-).

While modern Egyptological pronunciation renders her name as &quot;Nefertiti&quot;, her name was the sentence &quot;nfr.t jj.tj&quot; (or &quot;Nfr.t-jy.tj&quot;), meaning &quot;the beautiful one has come&quot;, and probably contemporarily pronounced &quot;Naftita&quot; from older &quot;Nafrat-ita&quot; or perhaps &quot;Nafert-yiti&quot;.

==Family and early life==
Almost nothing is known about Nefertiti&#x27;s life before her marriage to Akhenaten. Scenes from the tombs of the nobles in Amarna mention that Nefertiti had a sister, named Mutbenret. Further, a woman named Tey carried the title of &quot;Nurse of the Great Royal Wife.&quot; In addition, Tey&#x27;s husband Ay carried the title &quot;God&#x27;s Father.&quot; Some Egyptologists believe that this title was used for a man whose daughter married the pharaoh. Based on these titles, it has been proposed that Ay was in fact Nefertiti&#x27;s father. However, neither Ay nor Tey are explicitly referred to as Nefertiti&#x27;s parents in the existing sources. At the same time, no sources exist that directly contradict Ay&#x27;s fatherhood which is considered likely due to the great influence he wielded during Nefertiti&#x27;s life and after her death. According to another theory, Nefertiti was the daughter of Ay and a woman besides Tey, but Ay&#x27;s first wife died before Nefertiti&#x27;s rise to the position of queen, whereupon Ay married Tey, making her Nefertiti&#x27;s stepmother. Nevertheless, this entire proposal is based on speculation and conjecture.

It has also been proposed that Nefertiti was Akhenaten&#x27;s full sister, though this is contradicted by her titles which do not include the title of &quot;King&#x27;s Daughter&quot; or &quot;King&#x27;s Sister,&quot; usually used to indicate a relative of a pharaoh. Another theory about her parentage that gained some support identified Nefertiti with the Mitanni princess Tadukhipa, partially based on Nefertiti&#x27;s name (&quot;The Beautiful Woman has Come&quot;) which has been interpreted by some scholars as signifying a foreign origin. However, Tadukhipa was already married to Akhenaten&#x27;s father and there is no evidence for any reason why this woman would need to alter her name in a proposed marriage to Akhenaten, nor any hard evidence of a foreign non-Egyptian background for Nefertiti.

The exact dates when Nefertiti married Akhenaten and became the king&#x27;s great royal wife are uncertain. They are known to have had at least six daughters together, including Meritaten, Meketaten, Ankhesenpaaten (later called Ankhesenamun when she married Tutankhamun), Neferneferuaten Tasherit, Neferneferure, and Setepenre. She was once considered as a candidate for the mother of Tutankhamun, however a genetic study conducted on discovered mummies suggests that she was not.

==Life==

Nefertiti first appears in scenes in Thebes. In the damaged tomb (TT188) of the royal butler Parennefer, the new king Amenhotep IV is accompanied by a royal woman, and this lady is thought to be an early depiction of Nefertiti. The king and queen are shown worshiping the Aten. In the tomb of the vizier Ramose, Nefertiti is shown standing behind Amenhotep IV in the Window of Appearance during the reward ceremony for the vizier.
During the early years in Thebes, Akhenaten (still known as Amenhotep IV) had several temples erected at Karnak. One of the structures, the Mansion of the Benben (hwt-ben-ben), was dedicated to Nefertiti. She is depicted with her daughter Meritaten and in some scenes the princess Meketaten participates as well. In scenes found on the talatat, Nefertiti appears almost twice as often as her husband. She is shown appearing behind her husband the pharaoh in offering scenes in the role of the queen supporting her husband, but she is also depicted in scenes that would have normally been the prerogative of the king. She is shown smiting the enemy, and captive enemies decorate her throne.

In the fourth year of his reign, Amenhotep IV decided to move the capital to Akhetaten (modern Amarna). In his fifth year, Amenhotep IV officially changed his name to Akhenaten, and Nefertiti was henceforth known as Neferneferuaten-Nefertiti. The name change was a sign of the ever-increasing importance of the cult of the Aten. It changed Egypt&#x27;s religion from a polytheistic religion to a religion which may have been better described as a monolatry (the depiction of a single god as an object for worship) or henotheism (one god, who is not the only god).

The boundary stelae of years 4 and 5 mark the boundaries of the new city and suggest that the move to the new city of Akhetaten occurred around that time. The new city contained several large open-air temples dedicated to the Aten. Nefertiti and her family would have resided in the Great Royal Palace in the centre of the city and possibly at the Northern Palace as well. Nefertiti and the rest of the royal family feature prominently in the scenes at the palaces and in the tombs of the nobles. Nefertiti&#x27;s steward during this time was an official named Meryre II. He would have been in charge of running her household.
Inscriptions in the tombs of Huya and Meryre II dated to Year 12, 2nd month of Peret, Day 8 show a large foreign tribute. The people of Kharu (the north) and Kush (the south) are shown bringing gifts of gold and precious items to Akhenaten and Nefertiti. In the tomb of Meryre II, Nefertiti&#x27;s steward, the royal couple is shown seated in a kiosk with their six daughters in attendance. This is one of the last times princess Meketaten is shown alive.

Two representations of Nefertiti that were excavated by Flinders Petrie appear to show Nefertiti in the middle to later part of Akhenaten&#x27;s reign &#x27;after the exaggerated style of the early years had relaxed somewhat&#x27;. One is a small piece on limestone and is a preliminary sketch of Nefertiti wearing her distinctive tall crown with carving began around the mouth, chin, ear and tab of the crown. Another is a small inlay head (Petrie Museum Number UC103) modeled from reddish-brown quartzite that was clearly intended to fit into a larger composition.

Meketaten may have died in year 13 or 14. Nefertiti, Akhenaten, and three princesses are shown mourning her. The last dated inscription naming her and Akhenaten comes from a building inscription in the limestone quarry at Deir Abu Hinnis. It dates to year 16 of the king&#x27;s reign and is also the last dated inscription naming the king.

=== Possible reign as a Pharaoh ===

Many scholars believe Nefertiti had a role elevated from that of great royal wife, and was promoted to co-regent by her husband Pharaoh Akhenaten before his death. She is depicted in many archaeological sites as equal in stature to a King, smiting Egypt&#x27;s enemies, riding a chariot, and worshipping the Aten in the manner of a pharaoh. When Nefertiti&#x27;s name disappears from historical records, it is replaced by that of a co-regent named Neferneferuaten, who became a female Pharaoh. It seems likely that Nefertiti, in a similar fashion to the previous female Pharaoh Hatshepsut, assumed the kingship under the name Pharaoh Neferneferuaten after her husband&#x27;s death. She was then succeeded by Tutankhamun.

It seems less possible that Nefertiti disguised herself as a male and assumed the male alter ego of Smenkhkare. According to Van Der Perre, Smenkhkare is thought to be a co-regent of Akhenaten who died before Neferneferuaten assumed the kingship.

If Nefertiti did rule Egypt as a Pharaoh, it has been theorized that she would have attempted damage control and may have re-instated the ancient Egyptian religion and the Amun priests. She would have raised Tutankhamun in the worship of the traditional gods.

Archaeologist and Egyptologist Dr. Zahi Hawass theorized that Nefertiti returned to Thebes from Amarna to rule as a Pharaoh, based on ushabti and other feminine evidence of a female pharaoh found in Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb, as well as evidence of Nefertiti smiting Egypt&#x27;s enemies which was a duty reserved to kings.

==Death==

===Old theories===

Pre-2012 Egyptological theories thought that Nefertiti vanished from the historical record around Year 12 of Akhenaten&#x27;s reign, with no word of her thereafter. Conjectured causes included injury, a plague that was sweeping through the city, and a natural cause. This theory was based on the discovery of several ushabti fragments inscribed for Nefertiti (now located in the Louvre and the Brooklyn Museum).

A previous theory that she fell into disgrace was discredited when deliberate erasures of monuments belonging to a queen of Akhenaten were shown to refer to Kiya instead.

During Akhenaten&#x27;s reign (and perhaps after), Nefertiti enjoyed unprecedented power. By the twelfth year of his reign, there is evidence she may have been elevated to the status of co-regent: equal in status to the pharaoh, as may be depicted on the Coregency Stela.

It is possible that Nefertiti is the ruler named Neferneferuaten. Some theorists believe that Nefertiti was still alive and held influence on the younger royals. If this is the case, that influence and presumably Nefertiti&#x27;s own life would have ended by year 3 of Tutankhaten&#x27;s reign (1331 BC). In that year, Tutankhaten changed his name to Tutankhamun. This is evidence of his return to the official worship of Amun, and abandonment of Amarna to return the capital to Thebes.

===New theories===
In 2012, the discovery of an inscription dated to Year 16, month 3 of Akhet, day 15 of the reign of Akhenaten was announced. It was discovered within Quarry 320 in the largest wadi of the limestone quarry at Dayr Abū Ḥinnis. The five-line inscription, written in red ochre, mentions the presence of the &quot;Great Royal Wife, His Beloved, Mistress of the Two Lands, Neferneferuaten Nefertiti&quot;. The final line of the inscription refers to ongoing building work being carried out under the authority of the king&#x27;s scribe Penthu on the Small Aten Temple in Amarna. Van der Perre stresses that:

This means that Nefertiti was alive in the second to last year of Akhenaten&#x27;s reign, and demonstrates that Akhenaten still ruled alone, with his wife by his side. Therefore, the rule of the female Amarna pharaoh known as Neferneferuaten must be placed between the death of Akhenaten and the accession of Tutankhamun. Neferneferuaten, this female pharaoh, specifically used the epithet &#x27;Effective for her husband&#x27; in one of her cartouches, which means she was either Nefertiti or her daughter Meritaten (who was married to king Smenkhkare).

==Burial==
Nefertiti&#x27;s burial was intended to be made within the Royal Tomb as laid out in the Boundary Stelae. It is possible that the unfinished annex of the Royal Tomb was intended for her use. However, given that Akhenaten appears to have predeceased her it is highly unlikely she was ever buried there. One shabti is known to have been made for her. The unfinished Tomb 29, which would have been of very similar dimensions to the Royal Tomb had it been finished, is the most likely candidate for a tomb begun for Nefertiti&#x27;s exclusive use. Given that it lacks a burial chamber, she was not interred there either.

In 2015, English archaeologist Nicholas Reeves announced that high resolution scans revealed voids behind the walls of Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb which he proposed to be the burial chamber of Nefertiti, but subsequent radar scans showed that there are no hidden chambers.

In 1898, French archeologist Victor Loret found two female mummies among those cached inside the tomb of Amenhotep II in KV35 in the Valley of the Kings. These two mummies, known as &#x27;The Elder Lady&#x27; and &#x27;The Younger Lady&#x27;, were identified as likely candidates of her remains.

An article in &quot;KMT&quot; magazine in 2001 suggested that the Elder Lady might be Nefertiti. However, it was subsequently shown that the &#x27;Elder Lady&#x27; is in fact Tiye, mother of Akhenaten. A lock of hair found in a coffinette bearing an inscription naming Queen Tiye proved a near perfect match to the hair of the &#x27;Elder Lady&#x27;. DNA analysis confirmed that she was the daughter of Tiye&#x27;s parents Yuya and Thuya.

On 9 June 2003 archaeologist Joann Fletcher, a specialist in ancient hair from the University of York in England, announced that Nefertiti&#x27;s mummy may have been the Younger Lady. This theory was criticised by Zahi Hawass and several other Egyptologists. In a subsequent research project led by Hawass, the mummy was put through CT scan analysis and DNA analysis. Researchers concluded that she is Tutankhamun&#x27;s biological mother, an unnamed daughter of Amenhotep III and Tiye, not Nefertiti.

===KV21B mummy===

One of the two female mummies found in KV21 has been suggested as the body of Nefertiti. DNA analysis did not yield enough data to make a definitive identification but confirmed she was a member of the Eighteenth Dynasty royal line. CT-scanning revealed she was about 45 at the time of her death; her left arm had been bent over her chest in the &#x27;queenly&#x27; pose. The possible identification is based on her association with the mummy tentatively identified as Ankhesenamun. It is suggested that just as a mother and daughter (Tiye and the Younger Lady) were found lying together in KV35, the same was true of these mummies.

==Hittite letters==
A document was found in the ancient Hittite capital of Hattusa which dates to the Amarna period. The document is part of the so-called &quot;Deeds&quot; of Suppiluliuma I. While laying siege to Karkemish, the Hittite ruler receives a letter from the Egyptian queen. The letter reads:

This proposal is considered extraordinary as New Kingdom royal women never married foreign royalty. Suppiluliuma I was understandably surprised and exclaimed to his courtiers:
Understandably, he was wary, and had an envoy investigate the situation, but by so doing, he missed his chance to bring Egypt into his empire. He eventually did send one of his sons, Zannanza, but the prince died, perhaps murdered, en route.

The identity of the queen who wrote the letter is uncertain. She is called Dakhamunzu in the Hittite annals, a translation of the Egyptian title &quot;Ta hemet nesu&quot; (The King&#x27;s Wife). The possible candidates are Nefertiti, Meritaten, and Ankhesenamun. Ankhesenamun once seemed the likeliest, since there were no candidates for the throne on the death of her husband, Tutankhamun, whereas Akhenaten had at least two legitimate successors. But this was based on the assumption of a 27-year reign for the last 18th Dynasty pharaoh, Horemheb, who is now accepted to have had a shorter reign of only 14 years. This makes the deceased Egyptian king appear to be Akhenaten instead, rather than Tutankhamun. Furthermore, the phrase regarding marriage to &#x27;one of my subjects&#x27; (translated by some as &#x27;servants&#x27;) is possibly either a reference to the Grand Vizier Ay or a secondary member of the Egyptian royal family line. Since Nefertiti was depicted as being as powerful as her husband in official monuments smiting Egypt&#x27;s enemies, she might be the Dakhamunzu in the Amarna correspondence, as Nicholas Reeves believes.

<text>Freedom Press is an anarchist publishing house and bookseller in Whitechapel, London, United Kingdom, founded in 1886.

Alongside its many books and pamphlets, the group also runs a news and comment-based website and until recently regularly published &quot;Freedom&quot;, which was the only regular anarchist newspaper published nationally in the UK. The collective decided to close publication of the full newspaper in March 2014, with the intention of moving most of its content online and switching to a less regular freesheet for paper publication.

Other regular publications by Freedom Press have included &quot;Freedom Bulletin&quot;, &quot;Spain and the World&quot;, &quot;Revolt!&quot; and &quot;War Commentary&quot;.

==History==
=== 1886–1918 ===
The core group which went on to form Freedom Press came out of a circle of anarchists with international connections formed around the London-based radical firebrand Charlotte Wilson, a Cambridge-educated writer and public speaker who was in the process of breaking from Fabian Society orthodoxy. Among this founding group were Nikola Chaikovski, Francesco Saverio Merlino, and as of 1886, celebrated anarchist-communist Peter Kropotkin, who had been invited to Britain by Wilson after his release from prison in France in January of that year.

Wilson led a group of anarchists in founding Freedom as a social anarchist and anarchist communist group in September 1886, just a month after losing a vote in which the Fabians formally backed the parliamentary route to socialism. Alongside starting &quot;Freedom&quot; newspaper as a monthly beginning in October, the group also produced other pamphlets and books, primarily translations of international writers including Errico Malatesta, Jean Grave, Gustav Landauer, Max Nettlau, Domela Nieuwenhuis, Émile Pouget, Varlaam Cherkezov, Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Mikhail Bakunin and of course, Kropotkin himself. Discussion groups and public meetings were also begun early on.

In the early years of the paper Wilson funded and edited it out of a number of different offices while Kropotkin became a regular writer and provided its star turn. In 1895 Wilson resigned after a long series of personal difficulties and Alfred Marsh, a violinist, took over.

Marsh solidified the press alongside close collaborator William Wess, and they were joined by ex-members of the defunct Socialist League&#x27;s publication, &quot;Commonweal&quot; – John Turner, Tom Cantwell, and Joseph Presburg. Marsh was able to acquire more permanent premises and printing facilities at 127 Ossulston Street in 1898. &quot;Freedom&quot; collective member Donald Rooum notes:

&quot;Freedom Press stayed in Ossulston Street for the next 30 years. The hand-operated press dated from about 1820, and needed three operators; two to load the paper and pull the handle, and one to take the paper off.&quot;

With the acquisition of its own press, albeit an elderly one, the group was able to publish more often, and in 1907 started a second paper, &quot;Voice of Labour&quot;, which allowed former Spectator compositor Thomas Keell to become a permanent collective member, eventually taking over editorial duties at the paper in 1910 as Marsh&#x27;s health declined.

&quot;Freedom&quot; became one of the most widely read anarchist publications in the period leading up the First World War; however, the collective split in 1914–15 over how anarchists should respond to the conflict, with Keel&#x27;s anti-militarist position winning the backing of a majority of the national movement and Kropotkin leaving after he came out in favour of an Allied victory, a stance which would see him put his name to the &quot;Manifesto of the Sixteen&quot; in 1916. Keell and his companion Lilian Wolfe would go on to be imprisoned for the paper&#x27;s staunch opposition to the war in 1916, though Wolfe was quickly released.

===1918–1945===
As with many other anarchist enterprises, &quot;Freedom&quot; had trouble maintaining itself after the war ended as many activists had died and the seeming success of Marxist-Leninism in Russia drew British radicals into the orbit of an ascendant Communist Party of Great Britain. While donations allowed it to remain solvent for over a decade and several of its core group remained, notably John Turner who became its publisher from 1930 until his death in 1934, a crushing blow came in 1928 when the Ossulston Street building was demolished as part of a slum clearance scheme. Keell retired shortly afterward and while the collective continued to publish, it produced only an irregular newsletter over the course of the next eight years

The paper was relaunched 10 years later as energy and interest in the anarchists swelled around the Spanish Civil War, beginning with the publication of a fortnightly publication, &quot;Spain And The World&quot; (1936–38), which was renamed to &quot;Revolt!&quot;, and then &quot;War Commentary&quot; (1939–45), before being renamed back to &quot;Freedom&quot; in August 1945. It was edited by Vero Recchioni (who later changed his name to Vernon Richards), the son of an Italian anarchist, and Marie Louise Berneri, the daughter of Camillo Berneri, an Italian anarchist who was assassinated in Spain. The Italian anarchist movement had been well-established in London since the 1920s.

Much of the bookshop&#x27;s history through this time was tied up with Richards, who was the driving force behind both the press and the newspaper from the 1930s until late in the &#x27;90s. Richards teamed up with Keel and Wolff as publisher and administrator respectively - the latter would remain so until the age of 95. In 1942 the press was able to buy a printing firm, Express Printers, at 84a Whitechapel High Street, which it did with the help of a rival printing firm and a supporters&#x27; group, the Anarchist Federation, which would become the nominal owner of the title until it declared itself autonomous in the 1950s. With an avowedly anti-war stance, the paper would continue to publish throughout the war, and would face prosecution for its stance only in peacetime Britain.

===Post-War===
&quot;War Commentary&quot; was published with an overtly anti-militarist message, co-operating heavily with the pacifist movement, and in November 1944 the homes of several collective members were raided along with the offices of the press itself. When Richards, Marie-Louise Berneri, John Hewetson and Philip Sansom were arrested at the beginning of 1945 for attempting &quot;to undermine the affections of members of His Majesty&#x27;s Forces,&quot; Benjamin Britten, E. M. Forster, Augustus John, George Orwell, Herbert Read (chairman), Osbert Sitwell and George Woodcock set up the Freedom Defence Committee to &quot;uphold the essential liberty of individuals and organizations, and to defend those who are persecuted for exercising their rights to freedom of speech, writing and action.&quot;

In 1961, Freedom began producing &quot;Anarchy&quot;, a well-regarded series with noted front pages designed by Rufus Segar and seven years later the press moved to its current premises at 84b Whitechapel High Street after Whitechapel Art Gallery bought out 84A. At this point the press was entirely owned and run by Richards, though he would transfer ownership of the building to a company limited by guarantee and without share capital, The Friends Of Freedom Press, in 1982. Richards also relinquished control over the paper&#x27;s running from 1968, though would return periodically in editorially difficult moments and retained overall control of the press.

In 1981 the printing function of the press was once again lost, with several members of the printing collective spinning off those functions into Aldgate Press using money raised by Richards.

The bookshop was repeatedly attacked in the 1990s by neo-fascist group Combat 18 during street conflicts between fascist and anti-fascist groups in the East End and eventually firebombed in March 1993. The building still bears some visible damage from the attacks, and metal guards have been installed on the ground floor windows and doors, intended to ward against any further violence.

A second arson attack occurred on 1 February 2013, causing significant damage, but no-one was hurt. Donations allowed the press to survive, however cash losses from the paper forced its closure as a monthly publication in 2014, though free versions of the paper continue to be produced. In 2017 the press launched an archive, digitising more than 1,500 back issues of the paper covering the 1886–2020 period.

In March 2018 Freedom was made a core participant in the Undercover Policing Inquiry, following confirmation that former undercover Met officer Roger Pearce had written in the paper in 1980–81, mostly on Northern Ireland.

==Organisation==
Today Freedom Press remains as a functioning publishing house with much of its printing still being done by Aldgate Press. The Freedom collective runs an open meeting and exhibition space called Decenter, alongside maintaining an archive, bookshop and website. It shares the premises with Dog Section Press, the Anarchist Federation, the National Bargee Travellers Association, the Advisory Service for Squatters and Corporate Watch. The archive of the press is held at Bishopsgate Library, and much correspondence from its early period can be found at the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam.

==Authors and notable writers==
Having had a close affinity with Colin Ward and Vernon Richards, Freedom Press has produced much of their extensive back catalogue, in addition to titles by Clifford Harper, Nicolas Walter, Murray Bookchin, Gaston Leval, William Blake, Errico Malatesta, Harold Barclay and many others, including 118 issues of the journals &quot;Anarchy&quot;, edited by Colin Ward and 43 issues of &quot;The Raven: Anarchist Quarterly&quot;.

Over the years the &quot;Freedom&quot; editorial group has included Jack Robinson, Pete Turner, Colin Ward, Nicolas Walter, Alan Albon, John Rety, Nino Staffa, Dave Mansell, Gillian Fleming, Mary Canipa, Philip Sansom, Arthur Moyse, John Lawrence and many others. Clifford Harper maintained a loose association for 30 years.

Subjects of recent books include Emiliano Zapata, Nestor Makhno, Anti-Fascist Action and in 2021 the autobiography of &quot;Greek Robin Hood&quot; Vassilis Palaiokostas. At the end of 2018 the press published &quot;A Beautiful Idea: History of the Freedom Press Anarchists&quot;, to mark its 50th year at 84b Angel Alley. Notable modern authors include the Spanish political philosopher Thomas Ibanez (&quot;Anarchism is Movement&quot;, 2019) and anthropologist Brian Morris (&quot;A Defence of Anarchist Communism&quot;, 2022).

<text>The Overlord Embroidery, echoing the Bayeux Tapestry created 900 years before to commemorate the reverse invasion of England from Normandy, is a narrative embroidery that depicts the story of the D-Day Landings of 6 June 1944 and the subsequent Battle of Normandy. The story is told across 34 hand stitched panels running in total to 83 metres in length. The embroidery was created between 1968 and 1974, and is now on permanent display at The D-Day Story, Southsea, Portsmouth.

==Creation==

The piece was commissioned by Lord Dulverton in 1968 and made by the Royal School of Needlework from designs by artist Sandra Lawrence.

In a speech delivered on 6 June 1978 Lord Dulverton described his motivation behind the commission.

Lord Dulverton established a committee which included retired senior officers to advise on the project. In preparing her designs Sandra Lawrence studied archive photographs as research. Her subsequent sketches were then submitted to the committee for approval. After approval, she would then paint a colour version to the same size as the planned embroidery panel (2.4x0.9 metres). Then she would then use tracing paper to record the outlines of all the details. The original paintings from the design stage hang at the Pentagon, Washington D.C.

The team from the Royal School of Needlework used the technique called appliqué to bring the designs to life. Then attached to linen using a method known as pricking and pouncing. That is pricking thousands of tiny holes in a tracing paper template, placing them on a panel and applying a fine powder known as pounce. This makes a trail of dots which are joined with a pencil to reveal the design.

The embroidery was completed in January 1974. Since 1984 it has been housed in the D-Day Museum (now renamed The D-Day Story) in Southsea, Portsmouth.

==Description==
The embroidery tells the story of Operation Overlord, which was the code name for the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944. The narrative begins well before the invasion, with war-time production and The Blitz. It continues through the entry of the United States into the war, and the planning and preparation of the invasion. The majority of the work covers the crossing of the English Channel by the invasion fleet and the combat once the troops landed on the French coast. The embroidery ends with a scene of British infantry advancing as German troops retreat across the Seine.

There are 34 panels which together measure 83 metres (272 feet) in length. The Overlord Embroidery is one of the longest works of its kind in the world, at 10 metres (33 feet) longer than the Bayeux Tapestry, but shorter than the Prestonpans Tapestry. Twenty embroiderers worked for five years to create the embroidery. Battledress khaki and gold braid were appliquéd onto the panels.

<text>XXXX (pronounced four-ex) is a brand of Australian beer brewed in Milton, Brisbane, by Queensland brewers Castlemaine Perkins (now a division of the Japanese-owned company Lion). It enjoys wide popularity in the Australian state of Queensland, where it is commonly found on-tap in pubs and bars.

The XXXX brand was introduced by Castlemaine in 1924, and is a throwback to the long-standing tradition of using Xs to indicate the strength of an ale. The brand name is also built upon XXX Sparkling Ale introduced in 1878.

==Beers==

Currently sold brands include:
* XXXX Bitter, a 4.4% ABV Australian lager marketed under the brand XXXX. When ordering in Queensland, it is often referred to as XXXX Heavy.
* XXXX Gold, a mid strength lager – 3.5% ABV. XXXX Gold is also a lower carb beer.
* XXXX Summer Bright Lager, a full strength 4.0% ABV low carb beer. Summer Bright is also available with lime.
* XXXX Dry, marketed as an easy drinking full strength dry lager with a 4.2% ABV.
* XXXX Zero, an alcohol free lager at 0.0% ABV.

As well as these, previous beers that are no longer in mass production are occasionally available in small, limited releases at the XXXX Alehouse and Restaurant, located on the same site as the brewery. In the past, these have included:
* Thirsty Dog, a wheat beer popular in the 1990s.
* XXXX Draught, a less carbonated version of XXXX Bitter released in the 1970s, intended to replicate the unique taste of a beer from a wooden barrel.
* Carbine Stout, a stout brewed from 1915 to 2008, named after the racehorse Carbine from the 1890s.
* Castlemaine Best IPA, an India pale ale first brewed in 1918.
* In December 2019, the original XXX Sparkling Ale had a limited release in several bars across Brisbane&#x27;s CBD, including at the Alehouse.

Other beers that are no longer available include:
* XXXX Light, a lower alcohol beer at 2.3% ABV.
* XXXX DL Lager, a lower carbohydrate beer which was available at 4.4% ABV.
* XXXX Gold Australian Pale Ale, at 3.5% ABV.
* XXXX Summer Bright Mango, at 4.0% ABV.

==History==
The XXXX brand was launched in 1924 by Castlemaine Brewers, named after the town of Castlemaine, Victoria where the company was founded in 1857. The yellow-and-red label still bears the town&#x27;s name. XXXX has been brewed in the Castlemaine Perkins Milton Brewery since its introduction, and has featured an artist&#x27;s sketch (later very stylised) of its brewery on the label of beer bottles and cans. In the 1950s the prominent &#x27;XXXX&#x27; illuminated sign was erected on the brewery. &quot;XXXX&quot; itself refers to a traditional grading system for strong beer.

In 1992, Castlemaine Perkins was acquired by Australian beverage and food company Lion Nathan, who in turn were taken over by Japanese beverage conglomerate Kirin in 2009.

In March 2016, XXXX Bitter was reduced from 4.6% to 4.4% alcohol by volume (ABV).

==Distribution==

XXXX was brewed under licence in the UK by InBev Ltd until 2009. It was commonly available in cans in British off licences and sometimes on tap in British pubs. At 3.7% ABV, the British brewed XXXX was somewhat weaker than most of the Australian variants. Castlemaine XXXX was withdrawn from the UK at the end of June 2009 when InBev&#x27;s licensing agreement expired.

==Iconography, advertising and brand recognition==

XXXX&#x27;s mascot is Mr Fourex - a jovial cartoon man in a suit with a boater hat, who features on the City side of the Fourex Brewery at Milton. Conceived in 1924, he is said to be modelled after Paddy Fitzgerald, a former director of the company who started circa 1933. A second theory is that the cartoon is modelled on a well-known dwarf who sold newspapers in the inner city suburb of Fortitude Valley in the late 1920s. The true identity for the inspiration behind the cartoon remains a mystery.

A common nickname used by the military (Australian, passed along to their Allied guests) was &quot;Barbed Wire,&quot; as the XXXX has the appearance of the fence product used in the outback.

The second major campaign was launched in the early 1980s in the North Queensland area after the then general manager of &#x27;XXXX&#x27; Pat Holmboe heard of Clinton Howe, a locally well-known council road worker, being able to consume a high quantity of the beer in a short time (approx. 3L in 1 minute or 3/4 gal.). The company was forced to close the campaign within the first few days of T.V. advertising following government pressure.

An advertisement campaign from the 1980s and 1990s featured the tagline &quot;Australians wouldn&#x27;t give a XXXX for anything else.&quot;

Most beers under the XXXX label are sold in Australia as 375ml cans (&quot;tinnies&quot;), 375ml bottles (&quot;stubbies&quot;) and 750ml bottles (&quot;tallies&quot; or &quot;long necks&quot;), on tap (in most Queensland pubs but also to a lesser extent throughout the rest of Australia) and all bottles have twist top lids. Underneath the twist top lids there are trivia questions.

XXXX is still being served from wooden barrels at the Breakfast Creek Hotel in Newstead, Queensland. Whilst not cask-conditioned, as in the case of British real ale, the beer is unpasteurised and delivered by gravity.

In Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Discworld series of fantasy novels, an Australian-like continent is named XXXX, pronounced &quot;fourecks&quot;.

XXXX&#x27;s labels generally feature a depiction of the Milton Brewery alongside the Ipswich railway line, presently with a Queensland Rail EMU in the foreground with the existing extensive railway fencing omitted. Prior labels had steam engines and diesels when those locomotives were more regularly seen in Brisbane.

===Sports sponsorship campaigns===

XXXX is the major sponsor of the Queensland Maroons in the rugby league State of Origin series. XXXX Gold sponsors the Queensland Bulls and the QLD, SA, ACT and NT cricket associations. XXXX Gold also sponsors the Australian V8 Supercars Championship Series as well as the Professional Bull Riders&#x27; (PBR) Australian branch.

XXXX sponsored the &quot;XXXX Gold Beach Cricket Tri-Nations 2007&quot; series. It involved cricketers from Australia such as Allan Border, England including Graham Gooch and West Indies including Courtney Walsh and Sir Viv Richards.

From 2012 to 2015, XXXX GOLD had a three-year lease on the 15-acre Pumpkin Island on the Southern Great Barrier Reef, which they turned into XXXX Island to use in advertising and promotional events.

<text>The Conquest of Bread is an 1892 book by the Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin. Originally written in French, it first appeared as a series of articles in the anarchist journal &quot;Le Révolté&quot;. It was first published in Paris with a preface by Élisée Reclus, who also suggested the title. Between 1892 and 1894, it was serialized in part in the London journal &quot;Freedom&quot;, of which Kropotkin was a co-founder.

In the work, Kropotkin identified what he considered to be the defects of the economic systems of feudalism and capitalism, and argued that these systems thrive on and maintain poverty and scarcity. He proceeded to propose a more decentralized economic system based on mutual aid and voluntary cooperation, asserting that the tendencies for this kind of organization already exist, both in evolution and in human society.

&quot;The Conquest of Bread&quot; has become a classic of political anarchist literature. It was heavily influential on both the Spanish Civil War and the Occupy movement.

==Background==
In 1886, Kropotkin was released from French prison. Fearful of the anarchist scare that was gripping continental Europe following the assassination of Alexander II and wishing to focus more time on composing theory and arguing for his revolutionary ideals, Kropotkin moved to London in the same year. Following the death of Mikhail Bakunin in 1876, anarchists desired a prominent and respected theorist to explain their ideas and—after the splitting of the First International between Marxists and anarchists—Kropotkin wished to formally explain anarchist communism in a way that would clearly differentiate the anarchists from the Marxists, but also help to correct what he saw as flaws in Bakunin&#x27;s ideology of collectivist anarchism. With this aim, Kropotkin spent a great deal of time in London writing multiple books and pamphlets, in between his international speaking tours to the United States and Canada. It was during this time of rapid literary output that Kropotkin wrote &quot;The Conquest of Bread&quot;, which became his most well-known attempt to systematically explain the essential parts of anarchist communism.

Kropotkin originally wrote the text in French and published in the French journal &quot;Le Révolté,&quot; where he served as the primary editor. Following its publication in France, Kropotkin published a serialized version in English in the London anarchist journal &quot;Freedom&quot;. The book would later be collected and published as a book in France in 1892 and in England in 1906.

The publication of the text was a watershed moment in anarchist history, being the first time that a completed and in-depth theoretical work of anarchist communist theory was available to the public. The publication of the text shifted the focus of anarchism from individualist, mutualist and collectivist strains to social and communist tendencies. This shift would prove to be one of the most enduring changes in the history of anarchism as anarchism developed throughout the 20th century with Kropotkin and &quot;The Conquest of Bread&quot; as firm reference points.

==Summary==

===Chapters 1–3: The Right to Well-Being===
Throughout the first three chapters, Kropotkin constructs an argument for the common ownership of all intellectual and useful property due to the collective work that went into creating it. Kropotkin does not argue that the product of a worker&#x27;s labor should belong to the worker. Instead, Kropotkin asserts that every individual product is essentially the work of everyone since every individual relies on the intellectual and physical labor of those who came before them as well as those who built the world around them. Because of this, Kropotkin proclaims that every human deserves an essential right to well-being because every human contributes to the collective social product: 

Kropotkin further contends that the central obstacle preventing humanity from claiming this right is the state&#x27;s violent protection of private property. Kropotkin compares this relationship to feudalism, saying that even if the forms have changed, the essential relationship between the propertied and the landless is the same as the relationship between feudal lords and their serfs. Kropotkin calls for the destruction of the state and the expropriation of all property into the commons, where the right to well-being can be achieved for all people.

===Chapters 4–11: Anarchist Communist Society===
Throughout the middle of the book, Kropotkin sketches a picture of what he feels an anarchist communist society could look like. He points to the huge levels of production that modern industrial society achieved in terms of food production, clothing production, and housing production, and he uses this as evidence of the feasibility of an anarchist communist society. More than enough of the essentials are produced for all people, Kropotkin argues; if they were only distributed properly, nobody would have any unmet needs. Kropotkin further argues that with the level of production output being so high people should not have to work more than five hours a day and they should be able to reduce that as much as possible, giving them free time for leisure, socialization, and to work on innovations that would reduce their labor.

Near the end of this section, Kropotkin discusses luxury items, recognizing that they are a necessity for a good life and affirming that luxury items would still be produced, even if production were taken under the purview of common need. Kropotkin claims that luxury items would be produced on a collective basis by those most interested in their production. He uses an example of a group of pianists dedicating time to building luxury pianos with the help of a group of collective carpenters. Kropotkin argues that this system of collective production could produce necessary luxury items—on top of the production of the necessities—for everybody to live a fulfilling life.

===Chapters 12–17: Objections and Conclusion===
In the final chapters, Kropotkin lays out what he feels will be prominent objections to his theory as well as his responses to them. He figures that many critics will claim that people are naturally lazy and they would not work without a profit incentive, even if it is only for five hours and for basic necessities. Kropotkin counters by saying that people are willing to work in jobs they enjoy and given the necessary free time to work on their own, with the guarantee of material stability, people will work willingly on collective gardens or in collective garment factories.

Near the end of the work, Kropotkin cautions against the state centralization of industry, warning people against more authoritarian strands of socialism and claiming that any revolution must guarantee bread and freedom to the workers and revolutionaries. He ends with a long chapter on agriculture, marveling at the many ways in which humans have cultivated and advanced agricultural production, dreaming about the ways that it could be used to feed everybody and guarantee a healthy and happy life for all people.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Conquest of Bread&quot; has made an impact which exceeds Kropotkin&#x27;s own lifetime. It has played a prominent role in the anarchist militias of the Spanish Civil War as well as inspiring anarchist history, theory and praxis throughout the 20th century. Due to the problems of Marxism–Leninism in the Soviet Union, some thinkers came to regard the book as prophetic, with Kropotkin anticipating the many pitfalls and human rights abuses that would occur given the centralization of industry.

After the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the subsequent Occupy movement, Kropotkin&#x27;s work took on increased prominence. David Graeber, one of the intellectual leaders of the Occupy movement, cited Kropotkin directly as an inspiration for the world the Occupy protesters were attempting to create. In 2015, David Priestland, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, called for a renewed look at Kropotkin and &quot;The Conquest of Bread&quot; in the West, given the recent collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the global financial crisis of 2007–2008.

Sometimes the subject of leftist memes, it is known as &quot;The Bread Book&quot; colloquially. Since 2018, a loose group of left-leaning YouTube content creators have collectively been referred to as BreadTube, inspired by the title of the book. The term &quot;breadpilled&quot; refers to the act of becoming an anarcho-socialist, alluding to the red pill and blue pill from the 1999 film &quot;The Matrix&quot;.

<text>A King&#x27;s Counsel (post-nominal initials KC) is a senior lawyer appointed by the monarch (or their viceregal representative) of some Commonwealth realms as a &quot;Counsel learned in the law&quot;. When the reigning monarch is a woman, the title is Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC).

The position originated in England and Wales. Some Commonwealth countries have retained the designation, while others have either abolished the position or renamed it so as to remove monarchical connotations — for example, &quot;Senior Counsel&quot; or &quot;Senior Advocate&quot;.

Appointment as King&#x27;s Counsel is an office recognised by courts. Members in the UK have the privilege of sitting within the inner bar of court. As members wear silk gowns of a particular design, appointment as King&#x27;s Counsel is known informally as &quot;taking silk&quot; and KCs are often colloquially called &quot;silks&quot;. Appointments are made from within the legal profession on the basis of merit and not a particular level of experience. Successful applicants are normally barristers, or in Scotland, advocates, with at least 15 years of experience. 

In most Canadian jurisdictions, the designation is regulated by formal statute, such as, for example, &quot;King&#x27;s Counsel Act&quot; of British Columbia, that requires the candidates to have a minimum five years of experience, and to have made an outstanding contribution to the practice of law with high professional standards and good character and repute.

== Historical origins in England and Wales ==

===Historical background===

The attorney general, solicitor-general and king&#x27;s serjeants were King&#x27;s Counsel in Ordinary in the Kingdom of England. The first Queen&#x27;s Counsel &quot;Extraordinary&quot; was Sir Francis Bacon, who was given a patent giving him precedence at the Bar in 1597, and formally styled King&#x27;s Counsel in 1603. The right of precedence before the Court granted to Bacon became a hallmark of the early King&#x27;s Counsel. True to their name, King&#x27;s and Queen&#x27;s Counsel initially were representatives of the Crown. The right of precedence and pre-audience bestowed upon them – a form of seniority that allowed them to address the court before others – allowed for the swift resolution of Crown litigation.

The new rank of King&#x27;s Counsel contributed to the gradual obsolescence of the formerly more senior serjeant-at-law by superseding it. The attorney-general and solicitor-general had similarly succeeded the king&#x27;s serjeants as leaders of the Bar in Tudor times, though not technically senior until 1623, except for the two senior king&#x27;s serjeants, and 1813, respectively.

King&#x27;s Counsel came to prominence during the early 1830s, prior to which they were relatively few in number. It became the standard means to recognise a barrister as a senior member of the profession, and the numbers multiplied accordingly. It became of greater professional importance to become a KC, and the serjeants gradually declined. The KCs inherited the prestige of the serjeants and their priority before the courts. The earliest English law list, published in 1775, lists 165 members of the Bar, of whom 14 were King&#x27;s Counsel, a proportion of about 8.5%. roughly the same proportion existed, though the number of barristers had increased to about 12,250 in independent practice (i.e., excluding pupil barristers and employed barristers).

In 1839, the number of Queen&#x27;s Counsel was seventy. In 1882, the number of Queen&#x27;s Counsel was 187. The list of Queen&#x27;s Counsel in the Law List of 1897 gave the names of 238, of whom hardly one third appeared to be in actual practice. In 1959, the number of practising Queen&#x27;s Counsel was 181. In each of the five years up to 1970, the number of practising Queen&#x27;s Counsel was 208, 209, 221, 236 and 262, respectively. In each of the years 1973 to 1978, the number of practising Queen&#x27;s Counsel was 329, 345, 370, 372, 384 and 404, respectively. In 1989, the number of practising Queen&#x27;s Counsel was 601. In each of the years 1991 to 2000, the number of practising Queen&#x27;s Counsel was 736, 760, 797, 845, 891, 925, 974, 1006, 1043, and 1072, respectively.

In the 19th century in England, the position was primarily one of rank within the profession, giving the holder certain rights and privileges in the courts. They were ranked as senior counsel, and took precedence in argument after the Attorney General and the Solicitor General of England. Barristers who were not King&#x27;s (or Queen&#x27;s) Counsel were termed junior barristers, and followed senior barristers in argument. King&#x27;s (or Queen&#x27;s) Counsel normally always appeared in courts with a junior barrister, and led the direction of the case. The junior barrister on a case could not disagree with the direction determined by the senior barrister.

On colonial appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, established in 1833, the rule originally was that the case had to be led by a Queen&#x27;s Counsel from England, even if the colonial counsel held the same rank in the colonial courts. This rule was not eliminated until 1884, half a century after the establishment of the Judicial Committee.

Gradually, the appointment as King&#x27;s Counsel or Queen&#x27;s Counsel shifted from a vocational calling to a badge of honour and prestige. In 1898, Lord Watson noted in his opinion in &quot;Attorney General of the Dominion of Canada v. Attorney General for the Province of Ontario,&quot; writing on behalf of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, that:

===Restrictions===

Until the late 19th century, some barristers were granted a patent of precedence in order to obtain the same precedence as a KC without the concomitant restrictions. King&#x27;s Counsel were originally considered an office of profit and hence, under the Act of Settlement 1701, incompatible with membership of the House of Commons. KCs were also required to take the Oath of Supremacy, which Daniel O&#x27;Connell refused as a Roman Catholic. Despite being the most prominent and best-paid barrister in Ireland, he was a junior counsel for 30 years until granted a patent of precedence in 1831.

From the beginning, KCs were not allowed to appear against the Crown without a special licence, but this was generally given as a formality. This stipulation was particularly important in criminal cases, which are mostly brought in the name of the Crown. The result was that, until 1920 in England and Wales, KCs had to have a licence to appear in criminal cases for the defence. King&#x27;s Counsel and serjeants were prohibited, at least from the mid-nineteenth century, from drafting pleadings alone; a junior barrister had to be retained. They could not appear in judges&#x27; chambers or inferior courts, either, other than in exceptional cases. They were not permitted to appear in court without a junior barrister, and they had to have barristers&#x27; chambers in London.

These restrictions had a number of consequences: they made the taking of silk something of a professional risk, because the appointment abolished some of the staple work of the junior barrister; they made the use of leading counsel more expensive, and therefore ensured that they were retained only in more important cases; and they protected the work of the junior bar, which could not be excluded by the retention of leading counsel. By the end of the twentieth century, however, all of these rules had been abolished. Appointment as QC has been said to be a matter of status and prestige only, with no formal disadvantages.

In the 21st century, King&#x27;s Counsel continue to have the seniority in audience, following the Attorney General and the Solicitor General. It is still the rule that junior counsel must follow the lead of senior counsel in pleading a case, and cannot depart from senior counsel&#x27;s approach to the issues.

===Women appointed===

The first woman appointed King&#x27;s Counsel was Helen Kinnear in Canada in 1934. The first women to be appointed as King&#x27;s Counsel in England and Wales were Helena Normanton and Rose Heilbron in 1949. They were preceded by Margaret Kidd KC (later Dame Margaret Kidd QC) appointed a KC in Scotland in 1948. In Australia, the first QC appointed was Roma Mitchell, appointed 1962, who later became the first female Justice of the Supreme Court of South Australia (1965), and then the first female Acting Chief Justice.

==Recent developments in the United Kingdom==

===England and Wales===

In 1994, solicitors of England and Wales became entitled to gain rights of audience in the higher courts, and some 275 were so entitled in 1995. In 1995, these solicitors became entitled to apply for appointment as Queen&#x27;s Counsel. The first two solicitors were appointed on 27 March 1997, out of 68 new QCs. These were Arthur Marriott, partner in the London office of the Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, and Lawrence Collins, a partner in the City of London law firm Herbert Smith. Collins was subsequently appointed a High Court judge and ultimately a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.

The appointment of new Queen&#x27;s Counsel was suspended in 2003, and it was widely expected that the system would be abolished. However, a vigorous campaign was mounted in defence of the system. Supporters included those who considered it as an independent indication of excellence to those (especially foreign commercial litigants) who did not have much else to go on, and those who contended that it was a means whereby the most able barristers from ethnic minorities could advance and overcome prejudice as well as better represent members of an increasingly diverse society.

The government&#x27;s focus switched from abolition to reform and, in particular, reform of the much-criticised &quot;secret soundings&quot; of judges and other establishment legal figures upon which the old system was based. This was held to be inappropriate and unfair given the size of the modern profession, as well as a possible source of improper government patronage (since the final recommendations were made by the Lord Chancellor, who is a member of the government), and discriminatory against part-time workers, women, and ethnic minorities.

In November 2004, after much public debate in favour of and against retaining the title, the government announced that appointments of Queen&#x27;s Counsel in England would be resumed but that future appointees would be chosen not by the government but by a nine-member panel, the Queen&#x27;s Counsel Selection Panel, chaired by a lay person, to include two barristers, two solicitors, one retired judge, and three non-lawyers. Formally, the appointment remains a royal one made on the advice of the Lord Chancellor, but without comment on individual applications. The Lord Chancellor supervises the process and reviews the panel&#x27;s recommendations in general terms (to be satisfied that the process as operated is fair and efficient).

Application forms under the new system were released in July 2005 and the appointment of 175 new Queen&#x27;s Counsel was announced on 20 July 2006. A total of 443 people had applied (including 68 women, 24 ethnic minority lawyers, and 12 solicitors). Of the 175 appointed, 33 were women, 10 were ethnic minorities, and four were solicitors. Six people were also appointed QC &quot;honoris causa&quot;.

===Northern Ireland===

The title of KC continued to be used under the rule of Queen Elizabeth II. In 1998 two Northern Ireland barristers (Seamus Treacy and Barry Macdonald) opposed the requirement of swearing an oath of allegiance to the Crown. The Bar Council, the body which represents barristers&#x27; interests, had agreed, in the &quot;Elliott Report&quot;, that the royal oath should be dropped and replaced by a more neutral statement. It suggested that, instead of declaring services to Queen Elizabeth, barristers should &quot;sincerely promise and declare that I will well and truly serve all whom I may lawfully be called to serve in the office of one of Her Majesty&#x27;s Counsel, learned in the law according to the best of my skill and understanding&quot;.

In 1997, the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Robert Carswell, wrote &quot;I have little doubt myself that this is all part of an ongoing based campaign to have the office of Queen&#x27;s Counsel replaced by a rank entitled Senior Counsel, or something to that effect&quot;.

In 2000, the Northern Ireland High Court ruled in the barristers&#x27; favour. After more wrangling, the barristers were permitted to make &quot;a more neutral statement&quot; of commitment to principles.

===Scotland===

The independent bar is organised as the Faculty of Advocates and its members are known not as barristers but as advocates. The position of Queen&#x27;s Counsel was not recognised before 1868. The Scottish bar did have a concept of senior counsel before the introduction of the formal rank of Queen&#x27;s Counsel. An advocate would self-declare that they were &#x27;giving up writing&#x27;, meaning that they would no longer draft pleadings and move onto a supervisory role in litigation. In practice this meant that the practitioner would review and revise the written pleadings of their junior.

Initially the status of QC was reserved first for law officers (Lord Advocate and Solicitor General for Scotland) and soon after for the Dean of the Faculty of Advocates. In 1897, a petition by the Faculty of Advocates for the establishment of a Scottish roll of Queen&#x27;s Counsel was approved, and the names of the first appointees were published in the Edinburgh Gazette on September 3, 1897. By decision of Lord President Robertson, these first Scottish Queen&#x27;s Counsel were not required to make a declaration not to act against the Crown, and so Scottish King&#x27;s Counsel have never been required to obtain a licence to plead in order to do so.

In 2005, there were more than 150 QCs in Scotland. The appointment of King&#x27;s Counsel is made on the recommendation of the Lord Justice General to the First Minister of Scotland, formerly the Secretary of State for Scotland. In the 1990s, rules were changed so that solicitors with rights of audience in the Court of Session or High Court of Justiciary were permitted to apply for appointment, and two or three have done so. A solicitor advocate who is so appointed is designated as &quot;King&#x27;s Counsel, Solicitor Advocate&quot;.

===&quot;Honoris causa&quot;===

An award of King&#x27;s Counsel &quot;honoris causa&quot; (honorary KC) may be made to lawyers who have made a major contribution to the law of England and Wales but who operate outside court practice.

=== Courtesy appointments for Members of Parliament===

Until the 1990s there was a practice that sitting members of the UK Parliament (MPs) who were barristers were appointed QC, if they wished, on reaching a certain level of seniority of around fifteen years at the bar. Such appointments were sometimes known as &quot;courtesy&quot; or even &quot;false&quot; silk, and also as &quot;nylons&quot;. In the 1990s, it was felt that the practice of granting silk to MPs in this way, without considering their abilities, devalued the rank and the practice was abolished.

However, for now the practice persists for law officers of the Crown. Former Attorney General for England and Wales Jeremy Wright was not a QC when he was appointed, a subject which attracted some comment. Despite not having practised law for some time, Wright took silk shortly after his appointment, which was criticised by some as a breach of the protocol against &quot;courtesy silk&quot;. Similarly when Harriet Harman was appointed as Solicitor General she was made a QC. Suella Braverman took silk on 25 February 2020; earlier that month she had, like Wright, been appointed Attorney General.

===Death of Queen Elizabeth II===

Upon the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the succession of Charles III, the General Council of the Bar wrote that all QC titles changed to KC &quot;with immediate effect&quot;. This was not a matter of decision by the Bar Council, nor by the Crown Office. It is the automatic effect of the Demise of the Crown Act 1901, s 1.

==Countries that retain the designation==
King&#x27;s Counsel are retained in several Commonwealth realms where Charles III is head of state.

===Australia===

Appointments in the Commonwealth of Australia are made at both a federal and state level. The selection process varies from state to state. In New South Wales, for example, the process involves a committee made up of senior members of the State&#x27;s bar, and usually a non-practising former barrister such as a retired judge. The committee then consults with judges, peers, and law firms on the applicant&#x27;s suitability for the position. The selection committee deliberates in private, and reasons for the decisions are not published.

From 1993, the Commonwealth and most state and territory governments began to replace the title of Queen&#x27;s Counsel and appointment by letters patent with the title Senior Counsel as an honorific conferred by the legal profession, a trend that would reverse in the 2010s. There is no difference in status between a King&#x27;s Counsel and a Senior Counsel.

The first states to change to the title of Senior Counsel were New South Wales in 1993 and Queensland in 1994. Most other states and the Commonwealth Government followed over the next 15 years, including the ACT in 1995, Victoria in 2000, Western Australia in 2001, Tasmania in 2005, and South Australia in 2008. In the Northern Territory, the rank of King&#x27;s Counsel was never formally abolished, but in 2007 the rules of the Territory&#x27;s Supreme Court were amended to facilitate the appointment of Senior Counsel by the Chief Justice. Those appointed QC before the change in each jurisdiction were permitted to retain the old title.

In the 2010s, some states moved to revert to the old title of Queen&#x27;s Counsel. In 2013, Queensland restored the rank of Queen&#x27;s Counsel. Those appointed Senior Counsel before the reintroduction of Queen&#x27;s Counsel were given the option of retaining their old title or seeking appointment as Queen&#x27;s Counsel, while all new appointments would be as Queen&#x27;s Counsel only. Of the 74 Senior Counsel appointed in Queensland before the reintroduction of Queen&#x27;s Counsel in June 2013, only four opted to retain their title of Senior Counsel. In 2014, Victoria also restored the rank of Queen&#x27;s Counsel, by way of making new appointments first as Senior Counsel, but then giving the option to seek appointment as Queen&#x27;s Counsel by letters patent. In 2019, the South Australian Government announced it was also going to reinstate the title of Queen&#x27;s Counsel, and most eligible took the opportunity.

The Commonwealth appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel until March 2007. On 8 July 2010, Gillard government Attorney-General Robert McClelland appointed the first Commonwealth &quot;Senior Counsel&quot;. In March 2014, Attorney-General George Brandis QC announced that the Commonwealth would revert to using the title of Queen&#x27;s Counsel for new appointments and would give all existing Commonwealth Senior Counsel the option of changing their post-nominal to QC.

With the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the Australian Bar Association confirmed that all existing Queen&#x27;s Counsel would become King&#x27;s Counsel automatically.

When taking judicial office in a superior court, a barrister loses the title of King&#x27;s Counsel and only regains it if new letters patent are issued after the person leaves office. Conversely, since the appointment of Senior Counsel is not by letters patent, when a Senior Counsel takes office, there is no doctrinal reason why the title of Senior Counsel is lost. However, this is customarily not done, and the New South Wales Bar Association instructs that &quot;KC&quot; and &quot;SC&quot; postnominals should not be used for superior court judges.

==== Summary of Australian jurisdictions ====

===Canada===

====Constitutional authority for appointments====

In Canada, both the federal government and the provincial governments have the constitutional authority to appoint a lawyer as King&#x27;s Counsel.

During the reign of a queen, the title is properly &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Counsel learned in the law&quot; but normally referred to as &quot;Queen&#x27;s Counsel&quot; and abbreviated &quot;Q.C.&quot; in English or &quot;c.r.&quot; in French ( or for a female counsel). During the reign of a king, the title is &quot;King&#x27;s Counsel&quot; or &quot;K.C.&quot; in English, but continues to be &quot;c.r.&quot; in French ( or ).

====Criticisms and reforms====

Lawyers continue to be appointed King&#x27;s Counsel by the federal government and by nine of the ten Canadian provinces. The award has been criticised in the past on the basis that appointment as King&#x27;s Counsel depended largely on political affiliation. However, in those provinces which continue to appoint lawyers as King&#x27;s Counsel reforms have been made to de-politicise the award. Candidates are increasingly screened by committees composed of representatives of the bench and the bar, who give advice to the relevant Attorney General on appointments. The reforms have been designed to make the award a recognition of merit by individual members of the bar, often coupled with community service.

====Appointments by jurisdiction====

=====Federal government=====

The federal government stopped appointing Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1993, but resumed the practice in 2013 under the Harper Ministry. Appointments are recommended by the Minister of Justice, assisted by an advisory committee. In 2014, the government appointed seven lawyers as Queen&#x27;s Counsel. All were employed in the federal public service.

Since 2015, under the Trudeau Ministry, federal appointments as a Queen&#x27;s Counsel (or King&#x27;s Counsel since 8 September 2022) has been limited to the Attorney General of Canada. Jody Wilson-Raybould was appointed as Queen&#x27;s Counsel when she served as Attorney General and David Lametti was appointed a Queen&#x27;s Counsel on 15 April 2019.

=====Alberta=====

The provincial Cabinet appoints lawyers, of at least 10 years&#x27; standing, as King&#x27;s Counsel. Traditionally, the appointments are made every second year, but no appointments were made between 2016 and 2020. The nomination process resumed in 2019. Applications are reviewed by a screening committee of members of the judiciary and the legal community, which submitted recommendations for appointment to the Minister of Justice and Solicitor General and Cabinet for consideration, who in turn recommends names to Cabinet. In 2020, the province designated over 130 lawyers as Queen&#x27;s Counsel, and another round of appointees in February 2022.

=====British Columbia=====

King&#x27;s Counsel are appointed by the provincial Cabinet on the advice of the Attorney General of British Columbia. No more than 7% of the bar of British Columbia can be awarded the designation. Before making the recommendation to Cabinet, the Attorney General is required by statute to consult with the Chief Justice of British Columbia, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and two lawyers appointed by the Law Society of British Columbia. A recipient must have at least five years&#x27; standing at the bar of British Columbia.

In practice, the Attorney General appoints an advisory committee which includes these officials and also the Chief Judge of the Provincial Court, the president of the British Columbia Branch of the Canadian Bar Association and the deputy attorney general. Candidates must be acknowledged by their peers as leading counsel, have demonstrated exceptional qualities of leadership in the profession, or have done outstanding work in legal scholarship.

In 2020, the province designated twenty-six lawyers as Queen&#x27;s Counsel, from a group of 136 nominees.

The Attorney General of British Columbia is automatically appointed as King&#x27;s Counsel on taking office.

=====Manitoba=====

The government of Manitoba stopped appointing Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 2001. Existing designations had remained in effect. In 2019, Manitoba re-instituted the Queen&#x27;s Counsel designation. Appointments are made by the Law Society of Manitoba.

=====New Brunswick=====

The Lieutenant Governor appoints King&#x27;s Counsel on the advice of a committee comprising the Chief Justice of New Brunswick, the Attorney General of New Brunswick, and the president of the Law Society of New Brunswick. The committee&#x27;s recommendation must be unanimous. Recipients must have 15 years of active practice of the law in New Brunswick, with extensive experience before the courts, or demonstrate exceptional service to the profession. The Deputy Attorney General of New Brunswick and deans of New Brunswick law schools may also be appointed. The number recommended for appointment shall not exceed 1% of the members of the bar in New Brunswick who are not already designated, and the Lieutenant Governor shall only make appointments once per year. In 2016, the province designated eleven lawyers as Queen&#x27;s Counsel.

=====Newfoundland and Labrador=====

The Lieutenant Governor in Council appoints King&#x27;s Counsel, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice. The Minister is required to consult with the Legal Appointments Board, which consists of five individuals appointed by the Minister: two are from a list recommended by the Law Society of Newfoundland and Labrador, one is to be a lawyer from outside the metropolitan area of St John&#x27;s, one is to be a bencher, and one is to be a lawyer with less than ten years at the bar. The appointments process has been criticised in the past as lacking transparency and being too open to political appointments. In 2017, the government appointed eleven lawyers as Queen&#x27;s Counsel.

=====Nova Scotia=====

The Lieutenant Governor appoints King&#x27;s Counsel on the advice of the provincial Cabinet. Recipients must have at least 15 years as a member of the bar of Nova Scotia. The Minister of Justice is advised by an independent advisory committee, through the Nova Scotia Barristers&#x27; Society. Eligible candidates can apply, or they can be nominated by others. Applications generally open in September of each year, with appointments made annually.

According to the criteria published by the Nova Scotia Barristers&#x27; Society on the nomination form, candidates must demonstrate professional integrity, good character and outstanding contributions to the practice of law through recognition by other members of the profession as an exceptional barrister or solicitor, exceptional contributions through legal scholarship, teaching or continuing legal education, demonstration of exceptional qualities of leadership in the profession, and engaging in activities of a public or charitable nature in such a way as to raise the esteem in which the legal profession is held by the public. The Nova Scotia Barristers&#x27; Society also indicates that the committee is asked to consider regional, gender and minority representations among the persons recommended for appointment. In 2017, the government appointed 14 lawyers as Queen&#x27;s Counsel.

=====Ontario=====

From 1985 to 2022, the Government of Ontario stopped making appointments. In 1985, then-Premier of Ontario David Peterson made a statement in the house giving five reasons:
# the designation was originally meant to recognise excellence in the courtroom, but the practice in Ontario was that it could be given to any lawyer, regardless of courtroom experience;
# the use of the designation misled the public, because it was more based on who one knows than what one knows;
# it was unfair to lawyers who for whatever reason have not been designated, leading to questions about their standing in the profession;
# no other profession received government awards of this type; and
# the designation had been used in Ontario mainly as a form of political patronage.

In his statement, Premier Peterson stated that the government would stop awarding the designation and would move to revoke existing designations. Although the government did stop awarding the designation, it did not formally abolish it. Lawyers appointed as Queen&#x27;s Counsel prior to 1985 continued to use the QC (KC) or cr postnominal letters. In response to the government&#x27;s decision, the Law Society of Upper Canada, the governing body for Ontario lawyers, implemented the Law Society Medal in 1985 to recognise excellence in the profession. Recipients are entitled to use &quot;LSM&quot; behind their names.

Lawyers who are designated Certified Specialist are recognized and experienced in their field of law and have met high standards imposed by the Law Society of Ontario. This is commonly identified as modern day replacement to the Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC) designation.

Ontario courts continued to recognize the Queen&#x27;s Counsel designations of Ontario lawyers appearing before it where those lawyers were accorded the honorific by the Federal Government.

On 30 June 2023, the Attorney General for Ontario reinstituted the practice of appointing King&#x27;s Counsel, in honour of the coronation of Charles III. Until the designation&#x27;s reinstitution in 2023, there were calls from some members of the Ontario bar for the province to reinstate the King&#x27;s Counsel designation, on a merit basis, to help Ontario lawyers remain competitive internationally. However, the appointment of ninety-one Ontario lawyers, which included provincial Progressive Conservative cabinet ministers, conservative members of the Ontario Parliament, the Ontario Attorney General&#x27;s former staff members and more than a dozen party donors drew criticism.

In response, the Premier of Ontario promised on 18 July 2023 to change how King&#x27;s Counsel designations would be awarded to lawyers. A spokesman for the Attorney General of Ontario said that in the future there will be a public application process and lawyers will have to demonstrate &quot;a significant contribution to our justice system and work in the public interest.&quot; At a press conference to discuss the decision of the Federal Impact Assessment Act on 30 November 2023, in answer to a reporter&#x27;s question, the Attorney General of Ontario advised that a new process for awarding King&#x27;s Counsel designations by the Government of Ontario should be announced &quot;soon&quot; and &quot;shortly.&quot; Despite calls for the appointments in June 2023 to be rescinded, the Attorney General also confirmed that &quot;all of the individuals who received [a King&#x27;s Counsel designation] through service to the Crown will retain their designation&quot;. The head of the Law Society of Ontario had been offered a KC appointment but declined owing to the lack of selection criteria. In November 2023, the Advocates&#x27; Society wrote to the Attorney General to say that the main criterion for a KC appointment should be professional excellence rather than political affiliation and patronage, stating &quot;If the designation is permitted to fall into such disrepute again, public confidence in the legal profession will be undermined&quot;.

In August 2024, Premier Doug Ford said that the plan to create a protocol for KC appointments was not a priority, stating: &quot;People don&#x27;t give two hoots if they have KC behind their names.&quot; No further appointments have been made since July 2023, and the government has given no indication that it will make appointments in the future.

===== Prince Edward Island =====

The Lieutenant Governor in Council (i.e. the provincial Cabinet) makes appointments on the recommendation of a committee consisting of the President of the Law Society of Prince Edward Island, a member of the council of the Law Society, a person appointed by the provincial Minister of Justice, a judge of either the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, and a judge of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island. The committee&#x27;s recommendations must be carried by at least a vote. To be considered for appointment, a lawyer must have 10 years at the bar of Prince Edward Island.

The lawyer must meet the following three criteria: (1) must be learned in the law; (2) must have consistently exhibited a high standard of professional integrity; and (3) must be of very good character. In addition, the lawyer must meet at least one of the following six criteria: (1) must have a reputation for excellence in the practice of law; (2) must be recognized as a leading counsel; (3) must have great expertise and an outstanding reputation; (4) must have exhibited exceptional qualities of leadership in the legal profession; (5) must have performed outstanding work in the fields of legal education or legal scholarship; or (6) must have made a great contribution to community affairs or public service. In 2016, the government appointed two lawyers as Queen&#x27;s Counsel.

=====Quebec=====

The Government of Quebec stopped appointing Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1975. Over thirty years later, the Barreau of Quebec instituted a professional award, the distinction of &quot;Lawyer Emeritus / Avocat émérite&quot;, with the postnominal &quot;Ad. E.&quot; The award is to recognise lawyers &quot;who gain distinction as a result of their outstanding professional career, outstanding contribution to the profession or outstanding social and community standing that has brought honour to the legal profession&quot;. As of July 2018, the Barreau had awarded the distinction to over 350 lawyers.

=====Saskatchewan=====

The Lieutenant Governor-in-Council (i.e., the provincial Cabinet) appoints lawyers as King&#x27;s Counsel. To be eligible for appointment, a lawyer must reside in Saskatchewan and must have been called to the bar of any province or territory of Canada or the United Kingdom, for a period of at least 10 years. Appointments are based on recommendations from a selection committee consisting of Saskatchewan&#x27;s Justice Minister and Attorney General, the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan or the Chief Justice of the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench (on an alternating basis), and the past presidents of the Saskatchewan branch of the Canadian Bar Association and the Law Society of Saskatchewan. In December 2023, the Government appointed fourteen lawyers as King&#x27;s Counsel, with an additional four in early 2024.

===New Zealand===

In 2006, the title was renamed Senior Counsel, with the final appointments of Queen&#x27;s Counsel occurring in 2007, after which the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act (which made the change) came into force. However, the 2008 general election resulted in a change of government. In June 2009, Attorney-General Hon Christopher Finlayson announced that the title of Queen&#x27;s Counsel would be reinstated, and a bill to implement the restoration was introduced into Parliament in March 2010. The bill passed committee stage in November 2012, was passed in a third reading and received the Royal Assent on 19 November 2012. In December 2012, Finlayson was one of the first appointments under the reinstated regime.

=== Caribbean jurisdictions ===

==Jurisdictions that have abolished the designation==
In jurisdictions that have become republics, the office of Queen&#x27;s Counsel has sometimes been replaced with an equivalent, for example, Senior Counsel in Barbados, South Africa, Kenya, Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana; Senior Advocate in Nigeria, India and Bangladesh; and President&#x27;s Counsel in Sri Lanka.

===Barbados===

With Barbados becoming a republic on 30 November 2021 and the President of Barbados replacing Queen Elizabeth II as head of state, barristers were no longer to be appointed as Queen&#x27;s Counsel; however, those who had been appointed prior to the change of status were not required to adopt the title of Senior Counsel, and following the accession of King Charles to the British throne, were free to change their designation to King&#x27;s Counsel. Any future appointments are likely to be Senior Counsel.

===Cyprus===

When Cyprus was a crown colony, the title of Queen&#x27;s Counsel was granted to the colony&#x27;s attorney general. Although most attorneys general in Cyprus were British, the two Cypriots who served in this position also received this title. They were Stelios Pavlides, 1943–1952, and Criton Tornaritis, 1952–1956, who was also the first attorney general of the Republic of Cyprus after its independence in 1960. Also, this title was given to lawyers with an outstanding career in the Law Office of the Colonial Government, such as Ioannis Clerides, Neoptolemos Paschalis and George Chryssafinis.

===Hong Kong===

In Hong Kong, the rank of Queen&#x27;s Counsel was granted when it was a crown colony and a British dependent territory. A practising barrister could be appointed as Queen&#x27;s Counsel in recognition of his or her professional eminence by Crown Patent on the advice of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong. As Hong Kong was transferred from the United Kingdom in 1997, barristers are no longer appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC), but Senior Counsel (SC). The change is in name only; the role is in all practical respects unchanged even down to the full bottomed wig, gloves, robe and shoes worn annually at the commencement of the Judicial Year. Those appointed before the change were renamed Senior Counsel.

===Ireland===

The title of King&#x27;s Counsel was conferred until July 1924. The only King&#x27;s Counsel appointed under the Irish Free State was John O&#x27;Byrne, who was the Attorney General of Ireland, then later on, he was a judge on both the High Court of Ireland and the Supreme Court of Ireland.

The title of Senior Counsel was introduced in the Irish Free State in July 1924. Patents were issued by the Chief Justice of the Irish Free State and since 1937, patents are issued by the Chief Justice of Ireland.

However, many barristers continued to describe themselves as K.C. long after independence, even those who had been called to the bar after 1924. As late as the 1960s, R. G. L. Leonard (made KC before 1922) was described in the official Irish law reports as &quot;Queen&#x27;s Counsel&quot;, reflecting the accession of Elizabeth II in 1952.

===Malta===

As a British Crown Colony, Malta adopted the system which lasted only seven years, starting from 14 August 1832. In the period, the main courts were housed at the Castellania, and the wearing of silk gowns was required by those sitting on the bench.

===Nigeria===

Nigeria replaced the QC nomenclature with the new title of Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) beginning in 1975. Appointments are restricted to fewer than 30 lawyers a year, made by the Chief Justice of Nigeria on the recommendation of the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee, which is made up of senior judges and lawyers. The qualification requirements are almost identical to those required for appointment as King&#x27;s Counsel. The SANs are entitled to wear silk gowns and enjoy similar privileges as the King&#x27;s Counsel.

===Singapore===

Since independence, the title of Queen&#x27;s Counsel was replaced by Senior Counsel.

===South Africa===

Following the establishment of a republic on 31 May 1961, the title of Queen&#x27;s Counsel was replaced by Senior Counsel, or &quot;Senior Advokaat&quot; in Afrikaans.

===Sri Lanka===

President&#x27;s Counsel (postnominal PC) is a professional rank, as their status is conferred by the president, recognised by the courts and wear silk gowns of a special design. It is the equivalent of the rank of King&#x27;s Counsel in the United Kingdom, which was used in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) until 1972 when Sri Lanka became a republic, when the position became that of Senior Attorney-at-Law. In 1984, the position became the President&#x27;s Counsel. The holder can use the post-nominal letters &quot;PC&quot; after his or her name.

===Zambia===

In Zambia the designation was changed to State Counsel after independence from Britain in 1964. Legal practitioners who enjoy the rank and dignity of State Counsel may use &quot;SC&quot; after their names. The procedure for appointment is more or less based on the English system, but it has been alleged that this merit-based system has recently been influenced by political patronage and that the last three presidents have mainly appointed their supporters. In 2013, the Law Association of Zambia objected to the process used when President Michael Sata appointed Mumba Kapumpa, John Sangwa and Robert Simeza as SCs.

===Zimbabwe===

Following the declaration of a republic by the Smith regime in Rhodesia, senior advocates were designated as Senior Counsel. Despite this, existing Queen&#x27;s Counsels&#x27; designations were not affected.

==Dress==
The following relates to the dress of King&#x27;s Counsel at the Bar of England and Wales. Most other jurisdictions adopt the same dress, but there are some local variations.

King&#x27;s Counsel in England and Wales have two forms of official dress, depending on whether they are dressing for appearance in court before a judge or a ceremonial occasion.

===Court dress===

A male junior barrister wears a white shirt and white wing-collar with bands, underneath a double-breasted or three-piece lounge suit of dark colour. He has a black &quot;stuff&quot; gown over his suit, and wears a short wig of horsehair. A female junior barrister wears similar garb, except that the wing-collar with bands may be replaced with a court bib (or collarette).

Upon promotion to King&#x27;s Counsel, the male barrister retains in court his winged collar, bands, and short wig. However, instead of an ordinary dark jacket, he wears a special black court coat (frock coat) and waistcoat in a style unique to King&#x27;s Counsel or, alternatively, a long-sleeved waistcoat in similar style with no frock coat, known as a &quot;bum freezer&quot; because it is cut off at the waist.

He also replaces the black stuff gown of a junior barrister with a black silk gown, although cheaper variants are also worn, including gowns of the same cut but all wool, or in a silk-wool mix, or in artificial silk. The all-wool gown is, strictly speaking, a mourning gown, the Bar being still in mourning for Queen Anne who died on 1 August 1714, but that point is now of historical interest only. A female King&#x27;s Counsel wears a gown and wig similar to that of her male counterparts.

===Ceremonial dress===

For ceremonial occasions, King&#x27;s Counsel wear black breeches and black stockings instead of trousers, and patent leather court shoes with buckles. They wear the same black frock coat and waistcoat worn when appearing in court (never the &quot;bum freezer&quot;, however) but add lace at the wrists and a lace stock at the collar. Bands are no longer worn at the collar in addition to the lace, and the winged collar is also dispensed with. They have white cotton gloves, but these are invariably carried and not worn. This part of their ceremonial dress is taken from the standard ceremonial dress worn at the Royal Court (as opposed to the Courts of Justice) by other courtiers.

In addition, however, King&#x27;s Counsel wear distinctive full-bottomed wigs and their silk gowns. The silk gown is the same as that worn when appearing in court. It is this gown which gives rise to the colloquial reference to King&#x27;s Counsel as &quot;silks&quot; and to the phrase &quot;taking silk&quot; referring to their appointment.

When wearing the full bottomed wig, King&#x27;s Counsel have a black rosette hanging from the back of the neck, which was originally intended to catch oil and powder that might otherwise mark the silk gown. Modern wigs, however, are made of horsehair and so there is no longer any oil or powder.

<doc id="90073" wikidata="Q15270394" url="?curid=90073" title="Quaker Tapestry">
<text>The Quaker Tapestry consists of 77 panels illustrating the history of Quakerism from the 17th century to the present day. The idea of Quaker Anne Wynn-Wilson, the tapestry has a permanent home at the Friends Meeting House at Kendal, Cumbria, England.

The design was heavily influenced by the Bayeux Tapestry, and includes similar design choices, including three horizontal divisions within panels, embroidered outlines for faces and hands, and solid infilling of clothing, which is embroidered in the Bayeux technique. The tapestry is worked in crewel embroidery using woollen yarns on a handwoven woollen background. In addition to using four historic and well-known stitches (split stitch, stem stitch, chain stitch and Peking knot), Wynn-Wilson invented a new corded stitch, known as Quaker stitch, to allow for tight curves on the lettering.

Each panel measures wide by tall.

4,000 men, women and children from 15 countries worked on the panels between 1981 and 1989.

Panels have been toured in traveling exhibitions including a North American tour in 1993/1994. An exhibition of 39 panels in Ely Cathedral in 2012 attracted 11,273 visitors during its 27-day stay.

In October 2021, the museum was one of 142 sites across England to receive part of a £35-million injection into the government&#x27;s Culture Recovery Fund.

<text>Crewel embroidery, or crewelwork, is a type of surface embroidery using wool. A wide variety of different embroidery stitches are used to follow a design outline applied to the fabric. The technique is at least a thousand years old.

Crewel embroidery is not identified with particular styles of designs, but rather is embroidery with the use of this wool thread. Modern crewel wool is a fine, two-ply or one-ply yarn available in many different colours. Crewel embroidery is often associated with England in the 17th and 18th centuries, and from England was carried to the American colonies. It was particularly popular in New England. The stitches and designs used in America were simpler and more economical with the scarce crewel wool. The Deerfield Society of Blue and White Needlework (1896–1926) revived interest in crewel embroidery in the United States.

== Description of the technique ==
The crewel technique is not a counted-thread embroidery (like canvas work), but a style of free embroidery. Crewelwork had its heyday in Britain in the 17th century, but has come in and out of fashion several times since then. Traditionally, crewel embroidery is done on tightly woven linen twill, though more recently, other fabrics like Matka silk, cotton velvet, rayon velvet, silk organza, net fabric and also jute have been used. A firm fabric is required to support the weight of the stitching, which is done with crewel wool. This type of wool has a long staple; it is fine and can be strongly twisted. It is best to use a crewel needle to execute the stitches as a needle with a wide body, large eye and a sharp point is required.

The outlines of the design to be worked are often screen printed onto the fabric or can be transferred to plain fabric using modern transfer pens containing water-soluble ink or air-soluble ink, using a lightbox and a permanent pen, or iron-on designs applied using transfer sheets. The old-fashioned &quot;pinprick and chalk&quot; or &quot;prick and pounce&quot; methods also work well. The prick and pounce method involves transferring the design outlines – printed on paper – by pricking the outline with a needle to produce perforations along the lines. Powdered chalk or pounce material is then forced through the holes onto the fabric using a felt pad or stipple brush in order to replicate the design on the material.

Designs range from the traditional to more contemporary patterns. Traditional design styles are often referred to as Jacobean embroidery featuring highly stylized floral and animal designs with flowing vines and leaves.

Many different embroidery stitches are used in crewelwork to create a textured and colourful effect. Unlike silk or cotton embroidery threads, crewel wool is thicker and creates a raised, dimensional feel to the work. Some of the techniques and stitches include:
*Outlining stitches such as stem stitch, chain stitch and split stitch
*Satin stitches to create flat, filled areas within a design
*Couched stitches, where one thread is laid on the surface of the fabric and another thread is used to tie it down. Couching is often used to create a trellis effect within an area of the design.
*Seed stitches, applied randomly in an area to give a lightly shaded effect
*French knots are commonly used in floral and fruit motifs for additional texture
*Laid and couched work
* Long and short &quot;soft shading&quot;

In the past, crewel embroidery was used on elaborate and expensive bed hangings and curtains. Now it is most often used to decorate cushions, curtains, clothing and wall hangings. Recently several other items, such as lamp shades and handbags have been added.

Unlike canvas work, crewel embroidery requires the use of an embroidery hoop or frame on which the material is stretched taut and secured prior to stitching. This ensures an even amount of tension in the stitches, so that designs do not become distorted. Depending on the size of the finished piece, crewelwork is generally executed with a small portable hoop up to large free standing frames (also known as slates).

== Etymology ==
The origin of the word crewel is unknown but is thought to come from an ancient word describing the curl in the staple, the single hair of the wool. The word crewel in the 1700s meant worsted, a wool yarn with twist, and thus crewel embroidery was not identified with particular styles of designs, but rather was embroidery with the use of this wool thread.

== History of crewelwork ==
The earliest surviving example of crewelwork is The Bayeux Tapestry, which is not actually a tapestry at all. This story of the Norman Conquest was embroidered on linen fabric with worsted wool. The creators of the Bayeux Tapestry used laid stitches for the people and the scenery, couched stitches to provide outlines, and stem stitch for detail and lettering. The worsted wool used for the embroidery may have come from the Norfolk village of Worstead. There are few other early crewel embroideries known. The Jamtlands Lans Museum in Sweden has three related items, the Overhogdals tapestries, from the 11th–12th centuries that show people, animals, and other natural and human-built items. As of 2019, the primary theory is that these works depict the downfall of the world, the Ragnarok.

=== England ===
Wool from Worstead in Norfolk was manufactured for weaving purposes, but also started to be used for embroidering small designs using a limited number of stitches, such as stem and seeding. These were initially often executed in a single color. However, the color and design range expanded, and embroidery using this crewel wool began to be used in larger projects and designs, such as bed hangings.

Rich embroidery had been used extensively in ecclesiastical vestments and altar drapings, but after the Protestant Reformation, the emphasis moved to embroidery, including crewel work, for use in homes and other secular settings.

==== Elizabethan Period ====

Embroidery for household furnishings during the Elizabethan era was often worked using silk and wool on canvas or linen canvas. Garment embroidery more often used silk or silk and silver threads. Many different stitches were used for the embroidery, including &quot;back, basket, braid, pleated braid, brick, buttonhole, chain, coral, cross, long-armed cross, French knot, herringbone, link, long and short, running, double running, satin, seed, split, stem, tent as well as laid work and couching.&quot;

Motifs frequently used in crewel embroidery of the period included coiling stems, branches, and detached flower designs. Some embroideries from the Elizabethan period used garden motifs for their design, as gardens themselves were enjoying a heyday. These embroideries were worked in silk or wool (crewel), and were used in the home to brighten the surroundings. Embroidered wall hangings, table carpets, and various forms of bed-hangings might all sport embroidered images. The length of valences made them ideal for embroidery that told a story of a number of episodes.

==== Stuart Period ====
Queen Mary II (co-reigned 1689–1694 with her husband William II) and the women of her court were known for the very fine needlework they produced. Using satin stitch with worsted wool, they created hangings and other objects showing images of fruits, birds, and beasts. Their example spurred interest in crewel embroidery. Bed hangings and other furnishings were created, often using bluish greens supplemented by brighter greens and browns. Occasionally, &quot;a dull pinkish red&quot; would be the main color.

Designs in the latter part of the 1600s fell primarily into three categories. One was individual sprays of flowers scattered over the fabric; the second, to be found on narrow panels, involved flowering stems running the length of the panel with a floral motif between them; and the third was a branching tree with stylized leaves, the Tree of Life. The tree sits on a mound, and there might be other small motifs of individuals or flora and fauna near the mound. Jacobean embroidery from the first quarter of the 17th century is known for this third category. Some experts believe that these patterns were derived from cotton palampore from Masulipatam. However, other experts stress the importance of multiple influences from different parts of the world brought back by English travelers, and evolving designs from earlier forms of embroidery.

Flora and fauna found in the tree of life designs include the rose, noted for national and religious reasons, and two emblems of the Stuarts: the carnation and the caterpillar. Influence of exploration and trade are seen in plants in Jacobean that have recently become known to the English: the potato flower and the strawberry.

During the time of William and Mary, Chinese motifs began to appear in crewel embroideries, such as pagodas, long-tailed birds, and Chinese people. Just as Indian cottons may have influenced designs with trees and exaggerated leaves, these Chinese elements may have been inspired by Persian silks and calico fabric.

Jacobean embroidery designs enjoyed a resurgence in interest during the reign of Queen Anne (reigned 1702–1707). Patterns from the mid-1600s were copied, either exactly or with some alterations. While the tree motif is common to all, there is evidence of gradual change in the designs that link them together.

=== United States ===
==== Colonial America ====
Early fabrics made in the Colonies tended to be plain in both weave and in color. Fabric was made from white and black wool, and indigo dye was used. With the use of these materials, the fabric was gray, brown, or blue. Needlework was a way to enliven this fabric. and the earliest forms of needlework used were turkeywork and crewel embroidery.

While early American crewelwork, and embroidery more generally, followed in the tradition of their English counterparts regarding fabric, designs, and yarn, there were some differences. Early American works tend to display a smaller range of individual stitches, smaller and less complicated designs, and the designs cover less of the background fabric. A study of New England crewel embroidery found that the primary colors, blue, red, and yellow, were the most used. The stitches used most often were outline, seed, and economy, and the designs most frequently used showed plants.

Crewel embroidery was a pastime primarily in New England. There are some surviving examples from the mid Atlantic region, primarily New York and Pennsylvania, but these designs differed. Indeed, there were also stylistic differences within New England, with one region being the Massachusetts coast area centered on Boston, and another Connecticut.

Young women in New England in the 1700s were expected to become adept at needlework. Day and boarding schools that taught different types of needlework existed, as evidenced by advertisements in colonial Boston newspapers. They would embroider items both utilitarian, such as bed-hangings, curtains, clothes, and bed linens, and ornamental, such as wall hangings. In the early colonial period, the master bed was often located in the parlor, and thus on public display. Crewel bed-hangings provided both decoration and comfort, while serving as a status symbol. Women would also create smaller items decorated with crewel work, such as the detached pockets that were worn tied around one&#x27;s waist and envelope bags carried by men and women that were popular in the second half of the 1700s. 

Many of the embroidery patterns they worked from included common motifs: trees, birds, flowers, groups of figures or animals. This indicates that these patterns may have been variations of a small number of originals. Landscape patterns with figures were more realistic in the 18th century than they were in the 17th century, and seldom involved scenes from the Bible, as had earlier patterns. Many of the New England embroidery designs in the 1700s included rounded and curving elements.

Patterns for crewel designs were obtained in a number of ways. Patterns in both England and New England were often derived from elements taken from engravings of English and French artists. These elements, often figures or groups of figures, would be taken from various works and combined in different ways. In colonial New England, women used pattern books or sketches in magazines (such as &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Magazine&quot;) that were obtained from England. Design books of other types, such as gardens and furniture, were also used. Custom stamped fabric could be found in larger cities at times, as could custom-drawn sketches. Women may also have used designs from printed fabric for their crewel work.

From surviving Colonial crewelwork and written references such as letters, it is known that most projects were embroidered on linen. However, the preferred background fabrics were fustian (a twill fabric that generally had a linen warp with a cotton weft, though may have been all cotton) or dimity (which has fine vertical ribs and resembles fine corduroy).

The range of wool colors that needleworkers in colonial New England could call upon were rather limited. Many New England households grew indigo, which allowed wool to be dyed in various shades of blue. Other natural materials, used with or without mordants, used to dye wool included: butternut shells (spring green); hemlock bark (reddish tan); logwood (purple brown, blue black, deep black purple); broom sedge, wild cherry, sumac, and golden rod (yellow); onion skins (lemon and gold yellow); and cochineal (purple, deep wine red).

==== Deerfield Society of Blue and White Needlework ====

There was a resurgence of interest in crewel embroidery in Deerfield, Massachusetts, when two women, Margaret C. Whiting and Ellen Miller, founded the Deerfield Society of Blue and White Needlework. This society was inspired by the crewel work of 18th-century women who had lived in and near Deerfield. Members of the Blue and White Society initially used the patterns and stitches from these earlier works that they had found in the town museum. Because these new embroideries were not meant to replicate the earlier works, society artisans soon deviated from the earlier versions with new patterns and stitches, and even the use of linen, rather than wool, thread. Miller and Whiting used vegetable dyes in order to create the colors of the wool threads, and handwoven linen fabric was bought for use as the background. Members of this society continued their stitching until 1926.

<text>Benjamin Edward Meara Stiller (born November 30, 1965) is an American actor, comedian, and filmmaker. Known for his blend of slapstick humor and sharp wit, Stiller rose to fame through comedies such as &quot;There’s Something About Mary&quot; (1998), &quot;Zoolander&quot; (2001), and &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot; (2008). Stiller is also known for his work in franchises such as the &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; films (2000–2010), the &quot;Madagascar&quot; franchise (2005–2012), and the &quot;Night at the Museum&quot; films (2006–2014). His films have grossed more than $2.6 billion in Canada and the United States, with an average of $79 million per film. His awards and honors include an Emmy Award, a Directors Guild of America Award, a Britannia Award and a Teen Choice Award.

Stiller is the son of the comedians and actors Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. He began his career writing mockumentaries and was offered a variety sketch series, &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot;, which he produced and hosted for its 13-episode run. The series ran on MTV in 1990, and on Fox in 1992 and 1993, earning him a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Program. Stiller was a member of a group of comedic actors colloquially known as the Frat Pack.

Transitioning to acting in films, Stiller made his directorial debut with &quot;Reality Bites&quot; (1994) and went on to direct and star in films such as &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot; (2013). He also starred in a string of successful studio comedies, including &quot;Along Came Polly&quot; (2004), &quot;&quot; (2004), &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; (2004), and &quot;Tower Heist&quot; (2011). His performances in independent films include &quot;Flirting with Disaster&quot; (1996); &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; (2001); and the Noah Baumbach films &quot;Greenberg&quot; (2010), &quot;While We&#x27;re Young&quot; (2014), and &quot;The Meyerowitz Stories&quot; (2017).

Since the mid-2010s, Stiller has primarily worked as a television director and showrunner. In 2018 he directed the Showtime limited series &quot;Escape at Dannemora,&quot; earning a Directors Guild of America Award and two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Limited Series and Outstanding Directing for a Limited Series. In 2022, he was a director and executive producer on the Apple TV+ series &quot;Severance,&quot; earning two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Drama Series and Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series.

==Early life and education==
Benjamin Edward Meara Stiller was born on November 30, 1965 in New York City and raised in the Upper West Side of Manhattan. His father, comedian and actor Jerry Stiller, was born to Ashkenazi Jewish parents that had emigrated from Galicia in Poland. His mother, actress and comedian Anne Meara, who was from an Irish Catholic background, converted to Reform Judaism after marrying his father. While they &quot;were never a very religious family&quot;, they celebrated both Hanukkah and Christmas, and Stiller had a Bar Mitzvah.

His parents frequently took him on the sets of their appearances, including &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; when he was 6. He considered his childhood unusual, stating: &quot;In some ways, it was a show-business upbringing—a lot of traveling, a lot of late nights—not what you&#x27;d call traditional.&quot; His older sister, Amy, has appeared in many of his productions, including &quot;Reality Bites&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Zoolander&quot;. Stiller displayed an early interest in filmmaking and made Super 8 movies with his sister and friends.

At age 9, Stiller made his acting debut as a guest on his mother&#x27;s short-lived television series, &quot;Kate McShane&quot;. In the late 1970s, he performed with the New York City troupe NYC&#x27;s First All Children&#x27;s Theater, playing several roles, including the title role in &quot;Clever Jack and the Magic Beanstalk.&quot; After being inspired by the television show &quot;Second City Television&quot; while in high school, Stiller realized that he wanted to get involved with sketch comedy. During his high school years, he was also the drummer of the post-punk band Capital Punishment, which released the studio album &quot;Roadkill&quot; in 1982. The band&#x27;s bassist, Peter Swann, went on to become a judge on the Arizona Court of Appeals, serving from 2008 until 2022. The band reunited in 2018 to release a new EP, titled &quot;This is Capital Punishment,&quot; for Record Store Day. The current status of the band is unknown.

Stiller attended The Cathedral School of St. John the Divine and graduated from the Calhoun School in New York in 1983. He started performing on the cabaret circuit as opening act to the cabaret siren Jadin Wong. Stiller then enrolled as a film student at the University of California, Los Angeles. After nine months, Stiller left school to move back to New York City. He made his way through acting classes, auditioning and trying to find an agent.

==Career==
===Early work===
When he was approximately 15, Stiller obtained a small part with one line on the television soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, although in an interview he characterized his performance as poor. He was later cast in a role in the 1986 Broadway revival of John Guare&#x27;s &quot;The House of Blue Leaves&quot;, alongside John Mahoney; the production would garner four Tony Awards.

During its run, Stiller produced a satirical mockumentary whose principal was fellow actor Mahoney. Stiller&#x27;s comedic work was well received by the cast and crew of the play, and he followed up with a 10-minute short titled &quot;The Hustler of Money&quot;, a parody of the Martin Scorsese film &quot;The Color of Money&quot;. The film featured him in a send-up of Tom Cruise&#x27;s character and Mahoney in the Paul Newman role, only this time as a bowling hustler instead of a pool shark. The short got the attention of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, which aired it in 1987 and two years later offered Stiller a spot as a writer. In the meantime, he had a bit role in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;.

In 1989 Stiller wrote and appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as a featured performer. However, since the show did not want him to make more short films, he left after four episodes. He then put together &quot;Elvis Stories&quot;, a short film about a fictitious tabloid focused on recent sightings of Elvis Presley. The film starred friends and co-stars John Cusack, Jeremy Piven, Mike Myers, Andy Dick, and Jeff Kahn. The film was considered a success, and led him to develop the short film &quot;Going Back to Brooklyn&quot; for MTV; it was a music video starring comedian Colin Quinn that parodied LL Cool J&#x27;s recent hit &quot;Going Back to Cali&quot;.

===&quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot;===

Producers at MTV were so impressed with &quot;Back to Brooklyn&quot; that they offered Stiller a 13-episode show in the experimental &quot;vid-com&quot; format. Titled &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot;, this 1990 series mixed comedy sketches with music videos and parodied various television shows, music stars, and films. It starred Stiller, along with main writer Jeff Khan and Harry O&#x27;Reilly, with his parents and sister making occasional appearances.

Although the show was canceled after its first season, it led to another show titled &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot;, on the Fox Network in 1992. The series aired 12 episodes on Fox, with a 13th unaired episode broadcast by Comedy Central in a later revival. Among the principal writers on &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot; were Stiller and Judd Apatow, with the show featuring the ensemble cast of Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Andy Dick, and Bob Odenkirk. Both Denise Richards and Jeanne Tripplehorn appeared as extras in various episodes. Throughout its short run, &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot; frequently appeared at the bottom of the ratings, even as it garnered critical acclaim and eventually won an Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Writing in a Variety or Music Program&quot; posthumously.

===Directorial debut===

In the early 1990s, Stiller had minor roles in films such as &quot;Stella&quot; and &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; as well as a cameo in &quot;The Nutt House&quot;. In 1992, Stiller was approached to direct &quot;Reality Bites&quot;, based on a script by Helen Childress. Stiller devoted the next year and a half to rewriting the script with Childress, fundraising, and recruiting cast members for the film. It was eventually released in early 1994, directed by Stiller and featuring him as a co-star. The film was produced by Danny DeVito, who would later direct Stiller&#x27;s 2003 film &quot;Duplex&quot; and produce his 2004 film &quot;Along Came Polly&quot;. &quot;Reality Bites&quot; debuted as the fifth highest-grossing film over the President Day opening weekend and received mixed reviews.

Stiller joined his parents in the family film &quot;Heavyweights&quot; (1995), in which he played two roles. Following Heavyweights, he had a brief uncredited role in Adam Sandler&#x27;s &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; (1996) where he played Hal L., the sadistic orderly running the nursing home. Next, he had lead roles in &quot;If Lucy Fell&quot; and &quot;Flirting with Disaster&quot;, before tackling his next directorial effort with &quot;The Cable Guy&quot;, which starred Jim Carrey. Stiller once again was featured in his own film, as twins. The film received mixed reviews, but was noted for paying the highest salary for an actor up to that point, as Carrey received $20 million for his work in the film. The film also connected Stiller with future Frat Pack members Jack Black and Owen Wilson.

Also in 1996, MTV invited Stiller to host the VH1 Fashion Awards. Along with &quot;SNL&quot; writer Drake Sather, Stiller developed a short film for the awards about a male model known as Derek Zoolander. It was so well received that he developed another short film about the character for the 1997 VH1 Fashion Awards and finally remade the skit into a film.

In 2021, Stiller signed on to co-write and direct &quot;Bag Man&quot;, a Focus Features adaptation of the 2018 podcast about the kickback scandal that led to the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew. As of October 2023, the movie remains in pre-production.

===Comedic work===

In 1998, Stiller put aside his directing ambitions to star in the Farrelly Brothers&#x27; &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;, alongside Cameron Diaz, which became a surprise hit with a long-lasting cult following. That year, he starred in several dramas, including &quot;Zero Effect&quot;, &quot;Your Friends &amp; Neighbors&quot;, and &quot;Permanent Midnight&quot;. He was invited to take part in hosting the Music Video awards, for which he developed a parody of the Backstreet Boys and performed a sketch with his father, commenting on his current career.

In 1999, he starred in three films, including &quot;Mystery Men&quot;, where he played a superhero wannabe called Mr. Furious. He appeared in a segment on the July 26 episode of WWF RAW is WAR to promote the then-upcoming movie and found himself on the wrong end of Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett&#x27;s Figure-4 Leg Lock.

He returned to directing with a new spoof television series for Fox titled &quot;Heat Vision and Jack&quot;, starring Jack Black. However, the show was not picked up by Fox after its pilot episode and the series was cancelled.

In 2000, Stiller starred in three more films, including one of his most recognizable roles, a male nurse named Gaylord &quot;Greg&quot; Focker in &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;, opposite Robert De Niro. The film was well received by critics, grossed over $330 million worldwide, and spawned two sequels. In 2024 it was announced that Stiller and De Niro were in talks to make another Meet The Parents movie. Also in 2000, MTV again invited Stiller to make another short film, and he developed &quot;&quot;, a spoof of Tom Cruise&#x27;s role in &quot;&quot; and other films.

In 2001, Stiller directed his third feature film, &quot;Zoolander&quot;, in which he also starred as Derek Zoolander. The film featured multiple cameos from a variety of celebrities, including Donald Trump, Paris Hilton, Lenny Kravitz, Heidi Klum, and David Bowie, among others. The film was banned in Malaysia (as the plot centered on an assassination attempt of a Malaysian prime minister), while shots of the World Trade Center were digitally removed and hidden for the film&#x27;s release after the September 11 terrorist attacks.

After Stiller worked with Owen Wilson in &quot;Zoolander&quot;, they joined forces again for &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;.

Over the next two years, Stiller continued with a starring role in the film &quot;Duplex&quot;, and cameos in &quot;Orange County&quot; and &quot;Nobody Knows Anything!&quot; He has guest-starred on several television shows, including an appearance in an episode of the television series &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, in a flashback as the father of the character Arthur (played by Jerry Stiller). He also made a guest appearance on World Wrestling Entertainment&#x27;s WWE Raw.

In 2004, Stiller appeared in six different films, all of which were comedies, and include some of his highest-grossing films: &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, &quot;Envy&quot; (which he co-starred with Jack Black in), &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; (in which he had an uncredited cameo), &quot;Along Came Polly&quot;, and &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot;. While the critical flop &quot;Envy&quot; only grossed $14.5 million, the most successful film of these was &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot;, which grossed over $516.6 million worldwide.

He also made extended guest appearances on &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; and &quot;Arrested Development&quot; in the same year. He appeared on shows such as &quot;Friends&quot;, and &quot;Extras&quot;, the latter of which earned him a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series nomination. In 2005, Stiller appeared in &quot;Madagascar&quot;, which was his first experience as a voice actor in an animated film. &quot;Madagascar&quot; was a massive worldwide hit, and spawned the sequels &quot;&quot; in 2008 and &quot;Madagascar 3: Europe&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; in 2012.

In 2006, Stiller had cameo roles in &quot;School for Scoundrels&quot; and &quot;Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny&quot;; he was executive producer of the latter. In December 2006, he had the lead role in &quot;Night at the Museum&quot;. Although not a critical favorite, it earned over $115 million in ten days.

In 2007, Stiller starred alongside Malin Åkerman in the romantic comedy &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot;. The film earned over $100 million worldwide despite receiving mostly negative reviews.
In 2008, Stiller directed, co-wrote, co-produced, and starred in the film &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;, with Robert Downey Jr. and Jack Black; Stiller had originally conceived of the film&#x27;s premise while filming &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; in 1987.

In 2009, he starred with Amy Adams in &quot;Night at the Museum 2: Battle of the Smithsonian&quot;, sequel to &quot;Night at the Museum&quot;.

In 2010, Stiller made a brief cameo in Joaquin Phoenix&#x27;s mockumentary &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; and played the lead role in the comedy-drama &quot;Greenberg&quot;. He again portrayed Greg Focker in the critically panned but financially successful &quot;Little Fockers&quot;, the second sequel to &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;. He originally had planned to voice the titular protagonist of &quot;Megamind&quot; along with Robert Downey Jr., but later dropped out and was replaced by Will Ferrell while still remaining an executive producer and voicing a minor character in the film, a museum curator named Bernard.

In 2011, Stiller starred with Eddie Murphy and Alan Alda in &quot;Tower Heist&quot;, about a group of maintenance workers planning a heist in a residential skyscraper. He produced, directed, and starred in &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot;, which was released in 2013.

In 2018 and 2019, Stiller played Michael Cohen on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for 6 episodes.

In 2024 Stiller made his acting comeback after seven years with the holiday films &quot;Nutcrackers&quot; and &quot;Dear Santa&quot;, the latter also featuring Jack Black and having him in an uncredited role. While promoting the films Stiller appeared on the popular interview show Hot Ones. 

In December 2024, Stiller was featured in a music video trailer for singer SZA&#x27;s new album Lana, singing her song Drive.

==&quot;Frat Pack&quot;==

Stiller has been described as the &quot;acknowledged leader&quot; of the Frat Pack, a core group of actors who have worked together in multiple films. The group includes Jack Black, Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, Steve Carell and Paul Rudd. Stiller has been acknowledged as the leader of the group because of his multiple cameos and for his consistent use of the other members in roles in films which he produces and directs. He has appeared the most with Owen Wilson (in 12 films). Of the 35 primary films that are considered Frat Pack films, Stiller has been involved with 20, in some capacity.

Stiller is also the only member of this group to have appeared in a Brat Pack film (&quot;Fresh Horses&quot;). He rejects the &quot;Frat Pack&quot; label, saying in a 2008 interview that the concept was &quot;completely fabricated&quot;.

==Personal life==
Stiller dated several actresses during his early television and film career, including Jeanne Tripplehorn between 1990 and 1996, Calista Flockhart, and Amanda Peet.

In May 2000, Stiller married actress Christine Taylor at an oceanfront ceremony in Kauai, Hawaii. The two had met in 1999, while filming a never-broadcast television pilot for Fox called &quot;Heat Vision and Jack&quot;. Taylor and Stiller appeared together in the films &quot;Zoolander&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;, &quot;Zoolander 2&quot; and in the television series &quot;Arrested Development&quot; and &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. Both adopted a vegetarian diet for health reasons. After 17 years of marriage, Taylor and Stiller separated in 2017. They later reconciled after living together during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. The couple lives in Westchester County, New York and Manhattan and has two children, a daughter, Ella Olivia (born 2002), and a son, Quinlin Dempsey (born 2005). Stiller and Taylor&#x27;s daughter, Ella, graduated from the Juilliard School in New York City, New York with a degree in acting on May 24, 2024.

===Philanthropy and advocacy===

In 2001, Stiller appeared as a celebrity contestant on the game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;. He won $32,000 for his charity Project ALS, after incorrectly answering his $250,000 question in an attempt to equal Edie Falco&#x27;s $250,000 win.

Stiller supports such charities as Declare Yourself, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and the Starlight Starbright Children&#x27;s Foundation. He was appointed Goodwill Ambassador for UNHCR on July 2, 2018.

Stiller frequently impersonates such performers as Bono, Tom Cruise, Bruce Springsteen, and David Blaine. In an interview with &quot;Parade&quot;, he commented that Robert Klein, George Carlin, and Jimmie Walker were inspirations for his comedy career. Stiller is also a self-professed Trekkie and appeared in the television special &quot;Star Trek: 30 Years and Beyond&quot; to express his love of the show, as well as a comedy roast for William Shatner. He frequently references the show in his work, and named his production company Red Hour Productions after a time of day in the original series episode, &quot;The Return of the Archons&quot;.

Stiller considers Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to be his &quot;hero&quot;, and he visited him in Kyiv in June 2022; on the same trip Stiller visited Lviv, Irpin and Makariv to bring attention to the humanitarian need of refugees in Poland and Ukraine. Russia sanctioned Ben Stiller over his Ukraine support.

===Politics===
Stiller is a supporter of the Democratic Party and donated money to John Kerry&#x27;s 2004 U.S. presidential campaign. 

In February 2007, Stiller attended a fundraiser for Barack Obama and later donated to the 2008 U.S. presidential campaigns of Obama, John Edwards, and Hillary Clinton. 

Stiller supported vice president Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

===Health===
There have been false reports about Stiller&#x27;s mental health based on a joke he made during a 1999 GQ interview. In 2011 and 2018, Stiller clarified in interviews with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter and The Times,&quot; stating that he does not have bipolar disorder. He mentioned that his original comment was taken out of context and mistakenly presented as factual by the reporter.

Stiller was diagnosed with prostate cancer in June 2014 and was declared cancer-free in September 2014 following the surgical removal of his prostate.

<text>Mark Z. Danielewski (; born March 5, 1966) is an American fiction author. He is most widely known for his debut novel &quot;House of Leaves&quot; (2000), which won the New York Public Library&#x27;s Young Lions Fiction Award. His second novel, &quot;Only Revolutions&quot; (2006), was nominated for the National Book Award.

Danielewski began work on a 27-volume series, &quot;The Familiar&quot;, although he completed only five volumes before halting the project in 2017.

Danielewski&#x27;s work is characterized by an intricate, multi-layered typographical variation, or page layout, which he refers to as &quot;signiconic&quot;. Sometimes known as visual writing, the typographical variation corresponds directly, at any given narratological point in time, to the physical space of the events in the fictional world as well as the physical space of the page and the reader. Early on, critics characterized his writing as being ergodic literature, and Danielewski has described his style as:Signiconic = sign + icon. Rather than engage those textual faculties of the mind remediating the pictorial or those visual faculties remediating language, the signiconic simultaneously engages both in order to lessen the significance of both and therefore achieve a third perception no longer dependent on sign and image for remediating a world in which the mind plays no part.&quot;

==Personal life==
Danielewski was born in New York City to Tad Danielewski, a Polish avant-garde film director, and Priscilla Decatur Machold. Mark was Tad&#x27;s second child and his first with Priscilla; Mark&#x27;s sister Anne, also known as Poe, was born two years later. The Danielewski family moved continuously for Tad&#x27;s various film projects, and by the age of 10, Mark had lived in six countries: Ghana, India, Spain, Switzerland, Britain and the United States. He and his sister went to high school in Provo, Utah. Danielewski has said that these experiences helped him appreciate creativity in all its forms and showed him that &quot;there was much to be learned out there.&quot;

In 1985 Danielewski, aged 19, visited his half-brother, who was living on Rue des Belles Feuilles in Paris. Here, he began writing on a manual typewriter and enjoying the actual process of writing for the first time. During this period he wrote a story called &quot;Where Tigers Dance&quot;, which he has called &quot;so unfinished it didn&#x27;t deserve to be called incomplete&quot;, but has said that it continued &quot;to roam around&quot; in his imagination. 

In 1988 Danielewski graduated from Yale with a degree in English Literature; he had studied under John Hollander, Stuart Moulthrop, and John Guillory. He was also inspired by Harold Bloom. In 1989 he moved to Berkeley, California, where he enrolled in an intensive Latin course at the University of California, Berkeley. He then pursued graduate studies at the USC School of Cinema-Television in Los Angeles. During this time he became involved with &quot;Derrida&quot;, a documentary about the career and philosophy of Algerian-born French literary critic and philosopher Jacques Derrida. Danielewski was an assistant editor, sound technician and cameraman, and can be seen adjusting the sound equipment in Derrida&#x27;s suit jacket at one point in the film. He graduated with an MFA in 1993, the year his father died. It was also the year he had the idea of a house bigger on the inside than the outside, an image which would become his first novel, &quot;House of Leaves&quot;.

Danielewski has been a cat lover throughout his life. Cats show up in myriad ways throughout his works and are a main topic in his series &quot;The Familiar&quot;. In January 2016, Danielewski adopted two Devon Rex kittens, Archimedes and Meifumado, after his previous Devon Rex companions, Sibyl and Carl died.

==Career==

===&quot;House of Leaves&quot;===
Danielewski dates the origin of his debut novel &quot;House of Leaves&quot; to 1990 and a story that he wrote after finding out that his father was dying:

1990. My father was head of the USC School of Theater. I was living in New York. Then I got the phone call. The &#x27;Mark your father is dying&#x27; phone call. He was in the hospital. Renal failure, cancer. I got on a Greyhound bus and headed west. Over the course of three sleepless nights and three sleepless days I wrote a 100+ page piece entitled Redwood. I remember using a fountain pen. I barely had the change to buy sodas and snacks along the way and there I am scratching out words with this absurdly expensive thing of polished resin and gold. I&#x27;d like to say it was a Pelikan, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s correct. Another thing I seem to remember: the paper I was writing on had a pale blue cast to it. There was also something about how the pen seemed to bite into the paper at the same time as it produced these lush sweeps of ink. A kind of cutting and spilling. Almost as if a page could bleed. My intention had been to present this piece of writing as a gift to my father. As has been mentioned many times before, my father responded with the suggestions that I pursue a career at the post office. I responded by reducing the manuscript to confetti, going so far as to throw myself a pity parade in a nearby dumpster. My sister responded by returning later to that dumpster, rescuing the confetti, and taping it all back together.

Writing &quot;House of Leaves&quot; took ten years, and between 1993 and 1999, Danielewski made a living as a tutor, barista, and plumber. He eventually found a literary agent in Warren Frazier, who, according to Danielewski, &quot;fell in love with it.&quot; They went to roughly thirty-two publishers before Edward Kastenmeier from Pantheon decided to take on the project. Small sections of the book were downloadable off the internet before the release of the first edition, and it is said that these sections &quot;circulated through the underbellies of Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and San Francisco, through strip clubs and recording studios, long before publication&quot;though very few were able to experience the book this way initially.

The first edition hardback, which featured special signed inserts, was released on February 29, 2000, and Pantheon released the hardback and paperback editions simultaneously on March 7, 2000. The novel went on to win the New York Public Library&#x27;s Young Lions Fiction Award and gain a considerable cult following. &quot;House of Leaves&quot; has been translated into numerous languages, including Dutch, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, , Serbian, Spanish, and Turkish. It has been taught in universities.

A 2013 &quot;New York Times&quot; article featured a conversation between Stephen King and his son, Joe Hill, and made reference to the novel:

Joe and Stephen were having another typical conversation: hashing out what novel could be considered the &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; of horror. &#x27;That one with all the footnotes, they argued – no, not that one, the other one: Mark Danielewski&#x27;s &quot;House of Leaves&quot;.&#x27;

On June 18, 2018, Danielewski released a TV pilot script for the novel in the &quot;House of Leaves&quot; book club on Facebook.

====Collaboration with Poe====
In 2000, Danielewski toured Borders locations across America with his sister Poe to promote his book and her album &quot;Haunted&quot;, which has many elements of &quot;House of Leaves&quot;. The album features Danielewski reading from &quot;House of Leaves&quot; on several tracks, as well as audio recordings that Tad Danielewski left for Mark and Poe, which they found after his death. In 2001, a remake of Poe&#x27;s song &quot;Hey Pretty (Drive-By 2001 Mix),&quot; which featured Danielewski reading from &quot;House of Leaves&quot;, reached #13 on Billboard&#x27;s Alternative Chart. That summer, Poe and Danielewski spent three months as the opening act for Depeche Mode&#x27;s 2001 North American tour. On this tour, he played Madison Square Garden. He also composed the song &quot;A Rose Is a Rose,&quot; which Poe sang on the &quot;Lounge-a-Palooza&quot; compilation album.

===&quot;The Fifty Year Sword&quot;===
After the publication of &quot;House of Leaves&quot;, Danielewski worked on two projects in tandem: his second novel &quot;Only Revolutions,&quot; and a novella, &quot;The Fifty Year Sword&quot;, an &quot;adult ghost story&quot;. Danielewski created the book itself with the Dutch artist Peter van Sambeek. The recto pages of the book are empty except for page numbers and van Sambeek&#x27;s art. The Dutch publishing house De Bezige Bij published 1000 first editions on October 31, 2005, and 1000 second editions on October 31, 2006. Little is actually known about the inspiration for the story, or the exact time period during which it was written.

====Pantheon edition and theatrical collaborations====
In 2010, Danielewski announced that he would do a stage performance of &quot;The Fifty Year Sword&quot;, the first of which were on October 31, 2010 at the Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater (REDCAT) in Los Angeles. There were two back-to-back sold-out performances that night. The production featured music, five people reading the words of the five speakers in the novella (including Betsy Brandt, who played Marie Schrader on &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;), and shadow casting by Christine Marie. On October 31, 2011, Danielewski produced a slightly modified production back to back at REDCAT again. There was live music by Partch Ensemble percussionists Matthew Cook and T.J. Troy, as well as Christine Marie&#x27;s shadow casting and five actors reading. The two performances were again sold out.

In 2012, Pantheon released another edition of &quot;The Fifty Year Sword&quot;. This edition of the book includes more than 80 hand-stitched illustrations, new typography, and textual changes that were developed thanks to the REDCAT productions. Pantheon organised a book tour to support it, and thanks to an ARC Grant from the Center for Cultural Innovation, the production of &quot;The Fifty Year Sword&quot; went to five cities around the United States in conjunction with the book release tour for the Pantheon release of &quot;The Fifty Year Sword&quot;. These performances, smaller in production than the REDCAT performances, featured different actors at every city, including &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alumnus Darrell Hammond in New York. Pianist Christopher O&#x27;Riley, a longtime friend and fan of Danielewski, also toured for these performances. The final performance of the tour, on October 31, 2012, was another back-to-back, sold-out production at REDCAT.

===&quot;Only Revolutions&quot;===
Danielewski came up with the concept for his second novel, &quot;Only Revolutions&quot;, while he was touring for &quot;House of Leaves&quot; and working on &quot;The Fifty Year Sword&quot;. He had initially wanted to write something along the lines of a &quot;House of Leaves, Part 2&quot;, set in China or elsewhere. However, his publishers pushed for him to do something more complex, with more colors, typographical intricacies and constraints. There are seven colors in &quot;Only Revolutions&quot;, as opposed to four in &quot;House of Leaves&quot;. The novel also requires constant physical manipulation to read, whereas only certain sections of &quot;House of Leaves&quot; require readers to flip the book around. 

As the work progressed it became obvious to Danielewski that the novel was something of a counterpoint to &quot;House of Leaves&quot;; in fact, he has said in interviews that &quot;Only Revolutions&quot; is centrifugal while &quot;House of Leaves&quot; is centripetal. This aspect of the novel was brought to the forefront in the endpapers in the hardback versions of &quot;Only Revolutions&quot;, released September 12, 2006, as well as the &quot;A Spoiler&quot; published by the French literary magazine &quot;Inculte&quot; in 2007. A paperback edition of the book was published on July 10, 2007, an audiobook featuring music by Danny Elfman was also released that year, and an interactive ebook version was released through Apple&#x27;s iBooks on December 15, 2015.

&quot;Only Revolutions&quot; was a finalist for the 2006 National Book Award and has been translated into French, Dutch, and German. Like &quot;House of Leaves&quot;, &quot;Only Revolutions&quot; has a cult following and has been taught in universities. In 2013, two graduate students at UC Santa Barbara created an &quot;Only Revolutions&quot; database called Vizor.

====Collaboration with Biffy Clyro====
Danielewski is a fan of the Scottish rock band Biffy Clyro, as they discovered when Danielewski attended one of their shows after they borrowed the title &quot;Only Revolutions&quot; for their album of the same name. They collaborated for a performance on March 2, 2011, which included readings of &quot;Only Revolutions&quot; by Danielewski, musical performances by Biffy Clyro, and a Q&amp;A exploring how the book inspired the album. All proceeds went to Homeboy Industries, a Los Angeles-based non-profit that offers training and support to at-risk and formerly gang-involved youth.

===&quot;The Familiar&quot;===
According to Danielewski&#x27;s comments before his reading/performance of &quot;Parable #8: Z is for Zoo,&quot; he began work on &quot;The Familiar&quot; in 2006, while he was finishing &quot;Only Revolutions&quot;. It was originally supposed to be a 27-volume project. On September 15, 2010, Danielewski announced the work on his message board: &quot;Later this month publishers will receive the first 5 volumes of Mark Z. Danielewski&#x27;s 27 volume project entitled &quot;The Familiar&quot;. The story concerns a 12-year-old girl who finds a kitten. ...&quot; Danielewski expected the series to take him over a decade to complete. The first installment, &quot;The Familiar, Volume 1: One Rainy Day in May&quot;, was released on May 12, 2015. &quot;Volume 2: Into the Forest&quot; was released on October 27, 2015, &quot;Volume 3: Honeysuckle and Pain&quot; was published on June 14, 2016, &quot;Volume 4: Hades&quot; was released February 7, 2017, and &quot;Volume 5: Redwood&quot; completed Season One when it was released on October 31, 2017. On February 2, 2018, Danielewski announced via a Facebook post that &quot;The Familiar&quot; had been paused, saying &quot;I must agree with Pantheon that for now the number of readers is not sufficient to justify the cost of continuing.&quot; 

In a September, 2017 interview on KCRW&#x27;s &quot;Bookworm&quot;, Danielewski said the following when discussing &quot;The Familiar&quot; as it relates to the progression of literature:

&quot;And that&#x27;s where I think literature finally has to move; we&#x27;re very good at giving people a voice but we have not begun, strenuously enough, to give voice to that which will never have a voice: the voice of the waves, the animals, the plants, this world we inhabit&quot;&quot;

===Other work===
==== THROWN ====
From June 5 – September 9, 2015, Danielewski&#x27;s &quot;THROWN&quot;&quot;,&quot; a reflection on Matthew Barney&#x27;s &quot;CREMASTER 2&quot;, was displayed at the Guggenheim Museum during its Storylines exhibition.

====&quot;A Christmas Eve Carol&quot;====
In December 2018, Danielewski released &quot;A Christmas Eve Carol&quot; as a holiday card for his readers, saying, &quot;I wrote this over twenty years ago and it kept me going when the holidays seemed too dark (and, yeah, they still get dark). Thanks to family and an old friend, I finally finished it or at least managed to come up with this threadbare recording. It&#x27;s pretty much how I sing it to myself and these days to my little girl. So this year, in lieu of a holiday card with an inky, mischievous cat, please accept these few notes. They&#x27;ve given me comfort. May they give you comfort too ... whatever the hour, whatever the night.&quot;

===Atelier Z===
In 2010, Danielewski formed a group of translators, researchers, graphic designers, professors, students, and other professionals who work directly with him on various aspects of his work. The atelier has had various members, and in 2012 it was named Atelier Z. It functions like an artistic atelier or studio, with apprentice artists assisting to a master artist as they work on their own endeavors. The members have been listed in the credits of Danielewski&#x27;s books since 2012.

The atelier seems to have grown directly out of the collaborative work on the Pantheon edition of &quot;The Fifty Year Sword&quot;, which coincided with the first ever performances of any of Danielewski&#x27;s work under his own guise. He has spoken in interviews about a group that was working with him on the stitching/artwork for the first Pantheon edition of &quot;The Fifty Year Sword&quot;, and there is evidence of some of these people working on the productions of &quot;The Fifty Year Sword&quot;. In 2015, the Danielewski and Atelier Z released the first collection of Yarn + Ink, official &quot;House of Leaves&quot; and &quot;The Familiar&quot; apparel.

<doc id="90117" wikidata="Q13969" url="?curid=90117" title="Ring Nebula">
<text>The Ring Nebula (also catalogued as [[Messier object|Messier]] 57, M57 and [[New General Catalogue|NGC]] 6720) is a planetary nebula in the northern constellation of Lyra. Such a nebula is formed when a star, during the last stages of its evolution before becoming a white dwarf, expels a vast luminous envelope of ionized gas into the surrounding interstellar space. 

==History==
This nebula was discovered by the French astronomer Charles Messier while searching for comets in late January 1779. Messier&#x27;s report of his independent discovery of Comet Bode reached fellow French astronomer Antoine Darquier de Pellepoix two weeks later, who then independently rediscovered the nebula while following the comet. Darquier later reported that it was &quot;...as large as Jupiter and resembles a planet which is fading&quot; (which may have contributed to the use of the persistent &quot;planetary nebula&quot; terminology). It would be entered into Messier&#x27;s catalogue as the 57th object. Messier and German-born astronomer William Herschel speculated that the nebula was formed by multiple faint stars that were unresolvable with his telescope.

In 1800, German Count Friedrich von Hahn announced that he had discovered the faint central star at the heart of the nebula a few years earlier. He also noted that the interior of the ring had undergone changes, and said he could no longer find the central star. In 1864, English amateur astronomer William Huggins examined the spectra of multiple nebulae, discovering that some of these objects, including M57, displayed the spectra of bright emission lines characteristic of fluorescing glowing gases. Huggins concluded that most planetary nebulae were not composed of unresolved stars, as had been previously suspected, but were nebulosities. The nebula was first photographed by the Hungarian astronomer Eugene von Gothard in 1886.

==Observation==

M57 is found south of the bright star Vega, which forms the northwestern vertex of the Summer Triangle asterism. The nebula lies about 40% of the distance from Beta (β) to Gamma (γ) Lyrae, making it an easy target for amateur astronomers to find.

The nebula disk has an angular size of , making it too small to be resolved with 10×50 binoculars. It is best observed using a telescope with an aperture of at least , but even a telescope will reveal its elliptical ring shape. Using a UHC or OIII filter greatly enhances visual observation, particularly in light polluted areas. The interior hole can be resolved by a instrument at a magnification of 100×. Larger instruments will show a few darker zones on the eastern and western edges of the ring and some faint nebulosity inside the disk. The central star, at magnitude 14.8, is difficult to spot.

==Properties==
M57 is from Earth. It has a visual magnitude of 8.8 and a dimmer photographic magnitude, of 9.7. Photographs taken over a period of 50 years show the rate of nebula expansion is roughly 1 arcsecond per century, which corresponds to spectroscopic observations as 20–. M57 is illuminated by a central white dwarf of 15.75v visual magnitude.

All the interior parts of this nebula have a blue-green tinge that is caused by the doubly ionized oxygen emission lines at 495.7 and 500.7 nm. These observed so-called &quot;forbidden lines&quot; occur only in conditions of very low density containing a few atoms per cubic centimeter. In the outer region of the ring, part of the reddish hue is caused by hydrogen emission at 656.3 nm, forming part of the Balmer series of lines. Forbidden lines of ionized nitrogen or N II contribute to the reddishness at 654.8 and 658.3 nm.

===Nebula structure===
M57 is of the class of such starburst nebulae known as bipolar, whose thick equatorial rings visibly extend the structure through its main axis of symmetry. It appears to be a prolate spheroid with strong concentrations of material along its equator. From Earth, the symmetrical axis is viewed at about 30°. Overall, the observed nebulosity has been currently estimated to be expanding for approximately 1,610 ± 240 years.

Structural studies find this planetary nebula exhibits knots characterized by well-developed symmetry. However, these are only silhouettes visible against the background emission of the nebula&#x27;s equatorial ring. M57 may include internal N II emission lines located at the knots&#x27; tips that face the central star; however, most of these knots are neutral and appear only in extinction lines. Their existence shows they are probably only located closer to the ionization front than those found in the Lupus planetary IC 4406. Some of the knots do exhibit well-developed tails which are often detectable in optical thickness from the visual spectrum.

===Central star===
The central star was discovered by Hungarian astronomer Jenő Gothard on September 1, 1886, from images taken at his observatory in Herény, near Szombathely. Within the last two thousand years, the central star of the Ring Nebula has left the asymptotic giant branch after exhausting its supply of hydrogen fuel. Thus it no longer produces its energy through nuclear fusion and, in evolutionary terms, it is now becoming a compact white dwarf star.

The central star now consists primarily of carbon and oxygen with a thin outer envelope composed of lighter elements. Its mass is about , with a surface temperature of . Currently it is 200 times more luminous than the Sun, but its apparent magnitude is only +15.75.

<doc id="90118" wikidata="Q521688" url="?curid=90118" title="House of Leaves">
<text>House of Leaves is the debut novel by American author Mark Z. Danielewski, published in March 2000 by Pantheon Books. A bestseller, it has been translated into a number of languages, and is followed by a companion piece, &quot;The Whalestoe Letters&quot;.

The novel is written as a work of epistolary fiction and metafiction focusing on a fictional documentary film titled &quot;The Navidson Record&quot;, presented as a story within a story discussed in a handwritten monograph recovered by the primary narrator, Johnny Truant. The narrative makes heavy use of multiperspectivity as Truant&#x27;s footnotes chronicle his efforts to transcribe the manuscript, which itself reveals &quot;The Navidson Record&quot;″s supposed narrative through transcriptions and analysis depicting a story of a family who discovers a larger-on-the-inside labyrinth in their house.

&quot;House of Leaves&quot; maintains an academic publishing format throughout with exhibits, appendices, and an index, as well as numerous footnotes including citations for nonexistent works, interjections from the narrator, and notes from the editors to whom he supposedly sent the work for publication. It is also distinguished by convoluted page layouts: some pages contain only a few words or lines of text, arranged to mirror the events in the story, often creating both an agoraphobic and a claustrophobic effect. At points, the book must be rotated to be read, making it a prime example of ergodic literature.

The book is most often described as a horror story, though the author has also endorsed readers&#x27; interpretation of it as a love story. &quot;House of Leaves&quot; has also been described as an encyclopedic novel, or conversely a satire of academia.

==Background==
Danielewski dates the origin of the novel to 1990 and a story that he wrote after finding out that his father was dying:

1990. My father was head of the USC School of Theater. I was living in New York. Then I got the phone call. The &#x27;Mark your father is dying&#x27; phone call. He was in the hospital. Renal failure, cancer. I got on a Greyhound bus and headed west. Over the course of three sleepless nights and three sleepless days I wrote a 100+ page piece entitled Redwood. I remember using a fountain pen. I barely had the change to buy sodas and snacks along the way and there I am scratching out words with this absurdly expensive thing of polished resin and gold. I&#x27;d like to say it was a Pelikan, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s correct. Another thing I seem to remember: the paper I was writing on had a pale blue cast to it. There was also something about how the pen seemed to bite into the paper at the same time as it produced these lush sweeps of ink. A kind of cutting and spilling. Almost as if a page could bleed. My intention had been to present this piece of writing as a gift to my father. As has been mentioned many times before, my father responded with the suggestions that I pursue a career at the post office. I responded by reducing the manuscript to confetti, going so far as to throw myself a pity parade in a nearby dumpster. My sister responded by returning later to that dumpster, rescuing the confetti, and taping it all back together.

Writing &quot;House of Leaves&quot; took ten years, and between 1993 and 1999, Danielewski made a living as a tutor, barista, and plumber. He eventually found a literary agent in Warren Frazier, who, according to Danielewski, &quot;fell in love with it.&quot; They went to roughly thirty-two publishers before Edward Kastenmeier from Pantheon decided to take on the project. Small sections of the book were downloadable off the internet before the release of the first edition, and it is said that these sections &quot;circulated through the underbellies of Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and San Francisco, through strip clubs and recording studios, long before publication&quot;though very few were able to experience the book this way initially.

The first edition hardback, which featured special signed inserts, was released on February 29, 2000, and Pantheon released the hardback and paperback editions simultaneously on March 7, 2000. The novel went on to win the New York Public Library&#x27;s Young Lions Fiction Award and gain a considerable cult following. &quot;House of Leaves&quot; has been translated into numerous languages, including Dutch, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, and Turkish. It has been taught in universities.

==Summary==
Rather than Danielewski, the title page of &quot;House of Leaves&quot; credits two men named Zampanò and Johnny Truant as its authors. In an introduction dated 1998, Truant claims to have found the book as an unfinished manuscript left by the recently deceased Zampanò, having never met the author in life. Truant, an apprentice at a tattoo parlor in Los Angeles, decided to complete and submit the work for posthumous publication. The rest of the book is punctuated by footnotes by Truant, whether fact-checking, editorializing, translating, or interjecting seemingly irrelevant personal anecdotes. Truant&#x27;s work is further supplemented by uncredited professional editors, who profess to have, in turn, never met Truant.

Zampanò&#x27;s text claims that &quot;The Navidson Record&quot;, a documentary film directed by an acclaimed photojournalist named Will Navidson, became an American cultural phenomenon upon its theatrical release in 1993, generating volumes of multidisciplinary academic literature, as well as extensive media coverage in popular culture. In support, Zampanò cites or quotes articles, journals, symposia, books, magazines, TV programs, and interviews, many supposedly dedicated to this film. Zampanò discusses not only Navidson&#x27;s filmmaking techniques, but also segues into topics such as photography, architecture, Biblical studies, and radiometric dating, often interspersing overwhelmingly esoteric tangents, several of which devolve into nonsensical, page-long lists of only superficially relevant items. Though many of the academic works Zampanò cites appear to analyze the &quot;Record&quot; purely as a work of found-footage horror fiction, Zampanò&#x27;s writing remains adamant as to its authenticity.

Truant, however, debunks &quot;The Navidson Record&quot; as a wholesale fabrication, citing his own findings that the film does not exist; that Navidson is a fictionalization of the real-life photojournalist Kevin Carter; and that Zampanò outright invented numerous sources and quotes. Truant also determines that Zampanò copied secondary sources to hide his own inexpertise in various subjects. More paradoxically, Truant notes that Zampanò purports to authoritatively write about filmmaking and cinematography despite being blind. At the same time, Truant&#x27;s own factual errors, limited knowledge, and open admission to adulterating Zampanò&#x27;s work also throw his own reliability into question. The text is further marred by missing pages, missing footnotes, missing supplemental documents, and text accidentally or deliberately destroyed by Zampanò, Truant, or unknown causes.

An appendix provided by the editors includes a miscellany of writings from both Zampanò and Truant excluded from the body of the book, an obituary for Truant&#x27;s birth father, and a series of letters later compiled in the &quot;Whalestoe Letters&quot;. A segment titled &quot;Contrary Evidence&quot;, compiled by the editors themselves, instead contains what appears to be evidence of the &quot;Navidson Record&quot;″s actual existence, with a series of artworks depicting segments or concepts from the film as well as what purports to be a single, bootleg frame from within the film itself.

===&quot;The Navidson Record&quot;===
Flouting conventions of academic writing, Zampanò narrates the lives of the Navidson family during the events depicted in &quot;The Navidson Record&quot;, set in April 1990, including unfilmed events sourced from media and public records. The family are Will Navidson; his unmarried partner, Karen Green, a former fashion model; and their two children, Chad and Daisy.

&quot;The Navidson Record&quot; is described as the inadvertent product of an autobiographical documentary project: having recently moved into a new home in Virginia, the Navidsons installed cameras throughout the house to capture candid family moments. The family&#x27;s daily life was soon upended by doors appearing in once-blank walls of their house, opening onto new rooms that extend, impossibly, beyond the house&#x27;s outside dimensions.

Much of the film is described as footage from several ventures into a dark hallway which appears in the living room. Forbidden by Karen from entering, Navidson delegated exploration to a crew of professional explorers, who found, beyond the hallway, a maze-like complex containing an enormous spiral staircase which appears to descend endlessly. In the maze, they recorded footage of a multitude of corridors and rooms, completely unlit and featureless, with smooth ash-gray walls, floors, and ceilings. The maze is said to be silent save for the sound of a periodic low growl, which is never fully explained.

The explorations, already challenged by the maze&#x27;s inhospitable, vast, and ever-shifting nature, finally led to disaster when one of the crew turned on the rest. After several ordeals, one explorer was killed and another rescued, but the house itself then transformed in a hostile fashion, killing Navidson&#x27;s brother Tom and forcing the family to frantically escape.

Karen separated from Navidson, departing to New York City with their children. She turned to filmmaking herself to reconcile her relationship with Navidson, while also showing his footage to literary, artistic, and scientific authorities such as Stephen King, Stanley Kubrick, Douglas Hofstadter, Ken Burns, Harold Bloom, Camille Paglia, Hunter Thompson, Anne Rice, and Jacques Derrida. Navidson, still investigating the house, sought explanations from laboratory analysis, only to learn that samples taken from the maze are older than the Earth itself.

Ultimately, Navidson returned to the house alone, leaving only a seemingly incoherent letter for Karen. Despite ample preparation, Navidson became inextricably trapped in the maze. Navidson&#x27;s camera captured himself attempting to read a book titled &quot;House of Leaves&quot; in total darkness; having lost all supplies, he resorted to burning the book page by page to provide light for reading.

Meanwhile, Karen followed Navidson, finding the house now normal and the hallway gone. She resumed living in the house, becoming confident that Navidson can still be found within. One day, the maze reappeared to Karen, and she entered for the first time. She found Navidson emaciated and maimed by frostbite and injury, but they materialized together safely outside the house. The film concludes with Navidson and Karen marrying, and reuniting their family in Vermont.

===Truant footnotes===
Parallel to the plot of the &quot;Record&quot;, Truant&#x27;s footnotes document his descent into obsession, delusions, and paranoia as he compiles the manuscript. He recounts tales of sexual encounters, his lust for a tattooed dancer he calls Thumper, and his bar-hopping with his friend Lude. Truant also writes about his childhood living with an abusive foster father. Even as he grows increasingly unstable, Truant remains steadfast in his editorial work, neglecting all else.

Truant&#x27;s story ends with chapter XXI. Entirely written by Truant, this chapter recounts the conclusion of his downward spiral after Lude&#x27;s death. Truant invents two different accounts of positive turnarounds, only to disavow both. He then describes setting fire to the completed manuscript, and, after a struck-out passage in purple – the only such passage in the entire book – Truant tells an ambiguous story about a woman who loses her baby in childbirth. The remaining chapters conclude with no further text by Truant.

===&quot;The Whalestoe Letters&quot;===
&quot;The Whalestoe Letters&quot;, a compilation of letters written by Truant&#x27;s mother Pelafina during her committal at The Three Attic Whalestoe Institution, are published both as an appendix to &quot;House of Leaves&quot; and as a standalone book with additional content.

Though Pelafina&#x27;s letters and Johnny&#x27;s footnotes contain similar accounts of their past, their memories also differ greatly at times, due to both Pelafina&#x27;s and Johnny&#x27;s questionable mental states. Pelafina was placed in the mental institution after supposedly attempting to strangle Johnny, only to be stopped by her husband. She remained there after Johnny&#x27;s father&#x27;s death. Johnny claims that his mother meant him no harm and claimed to strangle him only to protect him from missing her. It is unclear, however, if Johnny&#x27;s statements about the incident—or any of his other statements, for that matter—are factual.

==Characters==

===Johnny Truant===
Johnny Truant serves a dual role, as primary editor of Zampanò&#x27;s academic study of &quot;The Navidson Record&quot; and protagonist as revealed through footnotes and appendices.

In the beginning of the book, Truant appears to be a normal, reasonably attractive young man who happens upon a trunk full of notes left behind by the now deceased Zampanò. As Truant begins to do the editing, however, he begins to lose the tenuous grip he has on reality, and his life begins to erode around him. He stops bathing, rarely eats, stops going to work, and distances himself from essentially everyone, all in pursuit of organizing the book into a finished work that, he hopes, will finally bring him peace.

Initially intrigued by Zampanò&#x27;s isolative tendencies and surreal sense of reality, Johnny unknowingly sets himself up as a victim to the daunting task that awaits him. As he begins to organize Zampanò&#x27;s manuscripts, his personal footnotes detail the deterioration of his own life with analogous references to alienation and insanity: once a trespasser to Zampanò&#x27;s mad realm, Truant seems to become more comfortable in the environment as the story unfolds. He even has hallucinations that parallel those of Zampanò and members of the house search team when he senses &quot;...something inhuman...&quot; behind him (page 26).

===Zampanò===
Though Truant attributes Zampanò as the author of &quot;The Navidson Record&quot;, Truant offers few concrete details about Zampanò&#x27;s character or past, citing only information learned from his former acquaintances. These include neighbors and various students and social workers, exclusively female, who volunteered as readers for Zampanò&#x27;s research. Unable to even determine Zampanò&#x27;s full name, Truant only confirms that Zampanò became blind some time during the 1950s, and was approximately eighty years old at the time of his death. Truant also learns that Zampanò was erratic and capricious in his lifestyle and writing habits, diagnosing him with graphomania.

Danielewski made Zampanò blind as a reference to blind authors Homer, John Milton and Jorge Luis Borges.

===Pelafina H. Lièvre===
Pelafina, more commonly referred to as simply &quot;P.&quot;, is Johnny&#x27;s institutionalized mother who appears in the appendix to the text. Her story is more fully developed in &quot;The Whalestoe Letters&quot;.

===Minor characters===
Lude: Johnny Truant&#x27;s best friend, Lude is also the one that informs him of Zampanò&#x27;s vacant apartment. Lude is a minor character, but some of his characteristics and actions are important in understanding Johnny. Lude assists Johnny many times in obtaining phone numbers of girls when they visit bars, clubs, and restaurants. Several times, Johnny mentions that he wishes he had not answered Lude&#x27;s call late at night. Every time Johnny and Lude are together they seem to involve themselves in difficult situations. He is killed in a motorcycle accident near the end of the novel.

Thumper: A stripper who is a regular client of the tattoo parlour where Truant works. Although Johnny has encounters with many women, he remains fixated on Thumper throughout. Thumper&#x27;s real name is eventually revealed to Johnny, but never to the reader.

===&quot;The Navidson Record&quot;===

====Will Navidson====
Will Navidson is described as having become a successful war photographer thanks to an early military career in war-torn regions, though haunted by his role as an impartial documentarist of war. Navidson is said to be a Pulitzer winner and recipient of prestigious arts grants, who has jeopardized his relationship with Karen due to years of prolonged absences while working overseas. As a conciliatory gesture, Navidson commits to prioritizing family over work by moving to the countryside. After promising Karen not to enter the hallway, he sends a crew in his stead to explore the maze, but privately chafes at this prohibition and breaks his word behind Karen&#x27;s back.

Many citations to critics, scholars, and media coverage present Navidson as a well-known public figure, with his notoriety further compounded by the film&#x27;s release; the extent of this public interest is such that academics are supposedly divided into three conflicting schools of thought interpreting his unexplained motivations for returning to the house.

====Karen Green====
Karen Green is described as Navidson&#x27;s partner of many years, and a former fashion model. Despite rearing two children together, Karen is said to have refused marriage to maintain her independence, particularly during Navidson&#x27;s absences. Karen is seen to have kept a collection of letters from would-be suitors, and interviews with associates reveal that she committed at least one adulterous affair. Karen is also seen, after discovering Navidson&#x27;s furtive exploration of the hallway, to have momentarily given in to one of the exploration crew&#x27;s advances.

During the explorations, with Navidson lost in the maze for days, Karen is seen to have confronted this loss and is said to have overcome her dependency on him, finally making good on her ultimatum to depart with their children. Afterwards, while separated, Karen produced a short film focused on her relationship with Navidson, which led to her returning to Virginia in search of him.

Zampanò&#x27;s text emphasizes Karen&#x27;s psychological state well beyond the scope of the film. Zampanò cites research and medical records as evidence that Karen radically transformed her personality while in high school to become indifferent and aloof, and also that Karen suffered from chronic claustrophobia.

====Tom Navidson====
Tom is described as Navidson&#x27;s fraternal twin, the two brothers once being close but estranged for eight years for unknown reasons. A handyman by trade, Tom is said to be a contented underachiever with no fixed residence or attachments, as well as a recovering alcoholic. He is also described as comical and well-liked by all his acquaintances, in contrast to Navidson&#x27;s cold professionalism. Much of this information is attributed to a supposed 900-page scholarly treatise analyzing the Navidson brothers as parallels to the Biblical brothers Esau and Jacob. Zampanò&#x27;s text includes an entire chapter extending this analysis, but most of the text is destroyed without explanation.

Arriving at the house to help Navidson measure its dimensions, Tom is said to have improved the family&#x27;s relationships and mood during his presence. Tom extended his stay to assist in the hallway explorations and subsequent rescue, in which he camped alone for days in the maze to maintain radio contact, built an improvised pulley to assist in the rescue, and, ultimately, saved the Navidsons&#x27; children from the house at the cost of his own life.

====Billy Reston====
Billy Reston is described as an African-American engineering professor at the University of Virginia, rendered paraplegic by a construction site accident near Hyderabad. Reston is said to be a longtime friend of Navidson, who photographed the very moment of Reston&#x27;s accident.

Intellectually engrossed by the anomalies of the house, Reston capably helped Navidson in measuring the house, organizing the explorations, and even rescuing the explorers, journeying through the maze himself despite his disability.

====Holloway Roberts====
Holloway Roberts is described as an accomplished professional hunter and explorer, contacted by Reston to lead the explorations in Navidson&#x27;s place. Roberts and Navidson were said to have developed a rivalry on first meeting, Roberts coveting Navidson&#x27;s success and fame, and Navidson resenting relinquishing his discovery to another. Over several explorations, Roberts, accompanied by assistants Kirby &quot;Wax&quot; Hook and Jed Leeder, found the spiral staircase but could not reach the bottom after many hours.

In &quot;Exploration #4&quot;, an expedition planned to last over a week, Roberts exhaustively provisioned his team, and also brought a gun. On their return after reaching the bottom of the staircase, they found their own caches of supplies vandalized by unknown causes. Believing an unseen creature roamed the maze, Roberts set out to hunt it, imperiling the team&#x27;s return journey. When he accidentally wounded Hook, Roberts began hunting his own team to cover up his crime, ultimately killing Leeder.

After Navidson and Reston rescued Hook, Navidson found Roberts&#x27; camera, which recorded footage of his final moments: lost and alone, with no supplies, Roberts ranted about the unseen creature he believed to be stalking him. After Roberts committed suicide, the camera captured shadows abruptly extinguishing the light of Roberts&#x27; remaining flare to seemingly consume his body. The text cites extensive academic debate stirred by the mystery of this footage.

==Format==
Danielewski wrote the book in longhand and revised it with a word processor. He then flew to Pantheon&#x27;s New York headquarters to do the typesetting himself in QuarkXPress because he only trusted himself with the book&#x27;s vision.

The book contains copious footnotes, many of which contain footnotes themselves, including references to fictional books, films or articles.

===Colors===
&quot;House of Leaves&quot; includes frequent and seemingly systematic color changes. While Danielewski leaves much of the interpretation of the choice of colors up to the reader, several distinct patterns emerge upon closer examination.

Notable examples include:
* The word &quot;house&quot; is colored blue (gray for non-color editions of the book and light gray for &quot;red editions&quot;). In many places throughout the book, it is offset from the rest of the text in different directions at different times. Foreign-language equivalents of &quot;house&quot;, such as the German and the French , are also blue. These colorizations even extend to the Random House publishing information on the book&#x27;s copyright page and back cover.
* In all colored editions, the word &quot;minotaur&quot; and all struckthrough passages are colored red.
* The phrase &quot;A Novel&quot; on the book&#x27;s cover appears in purple. The phrase &quot;First Edition&quot; on the copyright page appears in struckthrough purple. The phrase &quot;what I&#x27;m remembering now&quot; appears in struckthrough purple in Chapter XXI.

===Typeface changes===
Throughout the book, various changes in typeface serve as a way for the reader to quickly determine which of its multiple narrators’ work they are currently following. In the book, there are four typefaces used by the four narrators: Times New Roman (Zampanò), Courier (Johnny), Bookman (The Editors), and Dante (Johnny&#x27;s mother). (Additional font changes are used intermittently—Janson for film intertitles, Book Antiqua for a letter written by Navidson, and so on.)

==Companion works==

The book was followed by a companion piece called &quot;The Whalestoe Letters&quot;, a series of letters written to the character Johnny Truant by his mother while she was confined in a mental institution. Some (but not all) of the letters are included in the second edition.

&quot;House of Leaves&quot; was accompanied by a companion piece (or vice versa), a full-length album called &quot;Haunted&quot; recorded by Danielewski&#x27;s sister, Anne Danielewski, known professionally as Poe. The two works cross-pollinated heavily over the course of their creations, each inspiring the other in various ways. Poe&#x27;s statement on the connection between the two works is that they are parallax views of the same story. &quot;House of Leaves&quot; refers to Poe and her songs several times, not only limited to her album &quot;Haunted&quot;, but &quot;Hello&quot; as well. One example occurs when the character Karen Green is interviewing various academics on their interpretations of the short film &quot;Exploration #4&quot;; she consults a &quot;Poet,&quot; but there is a space between the &quot;Poe&quot; and the &quot;t,&quot; suggesting that Poe at one point commented on the book. It may also be a reference to Edgar Allan Poe.

The album &quot;Haunted&quot; also draws heavily from the novel, featuring tracks called &quot;House of Leaves&quot;, &quot;Exploration B&quot; and &quot;5&amp;½ Minute Hallway&quot;, and many less obvious references. The video for &quot;Hey Pretty&quot; also features Mark Danielewski reading from &quot;House of Leaves&quot; (pp. 88–89), and in &quot;House of Leaves&quot;, the band Liberty Bell&#x27;s lyrics were also songs on Poe&#x27;s album.

In 2017, Danielewski entered talks to adapt the novel into a TV series, stating that if a deal was not made by February 2020, the project would be abandoned. Ultimately, Danielewski published screenplays of three episodes online. A sequel to the book, the screenplays both adapt the original story and extend it to the present day. Past sequences, depicted as filmed by a then-young filmmaker named Mélisande Avignon, contradict the book significantly: Zampanò&#x27;s work, found by Truant, was not a manuscript but the actual film footage of &quot;The Navidson Record&quot;. This and Avignon&#x27;s film are later seized, and public knowledge of them suppressed, by a &quot;data disposal&quot; company called Skiadyne. In the present, unknown forces steal both films from Skiadyne and return them to Avignon, leading to a high-stakes fight for control. The book &quot;House of Leaves&quot;, now academically studied as a work of fiction, becomes embroiled in a &quot;fake fiction&quot; scandal when Avignon publicizes its factual basis by leaking the films.

On June 18, 2018, Danielewski released the TV pilot script in the &quot;House of Leaves&quot; book club on Facebook.

==Reception==
According to Book Marks, primarily from American publications, the book received a &quot;positive&quot; consensus, based on nine critic reviews: five &quot;rave&quot;, two &quot;positive&quot;, one &quot;mixed&quot;, and one &quot;pan&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Sunday Times&quot; review under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Guardian&quot;, &quot;Observer&quot;, and &quot;Literary Review&quot; reviews under &quot;Pretty Good&quot; and &quot;Independent&quot; review under &quot;Ok&quot; and &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; review under &quot;Rubbish&quot;. Globally, Complete Review saying on the consensus &quot;No consensus. Some incredibly effusive, others hardly impressed. Most like at least aspects of the house-horror story, but opinion is sharply divided regarding the literary devices and trickery.&quot; 

Steven Poole, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, admired the book and interpreted it as a parody of academia: &quot;Danielewski...weaves around his brutally efficient and genuinely chilling story a delightful and often very funny satire of academic criticism.&quot; Steven Moore, writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, also praised the novel: &quot;Danielewski&#x27;s achievement lies in taking some staples of horror fiction – the haunted house, the mysterious manuscript that casts a spell on its hapless reader – and using his impressive erudition to recover the mythological and psychological origins of horror, and then enlisting the full array of avant-garde literary techniques to reinvigorate a genre long abandoned to hacks.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s Emily Barton was less impressed: &quot;Danielewski’s bloated and bollixed first novel certainly attempts to pass itself off as an ambitious work; the question for each reader is if the payoff makes the effort of slogging through its endless posturing worthwhile.&quot; Scholar David Letzler identified the book as an encyclopedic novel, drawing on the faux-academic writing conventions and narrative &quot;cruft&quot; of &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; in particular.

A 2013 &quot;New York Times&quot; article featured a conversation between Stephen King and his son, Joe Hill, and made reference to the novel:

Joe and Stephen were having another typical conversation: hashing out what novel could be considered the &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; of horror. &#x27;That one with all the footnotes, they argued – no, not that one, the other one: Mark Danielewski&#x27;s &quot;House of Leaves&quot;.&#x27;

==Legacy==
&quot;House of Leaves&quot; served as one of the prime inspirations for MyHouse.wad, a &quot;Doom II&quot; mod revolving around a house that is constantly shifting and changing in uncomfortable ways, making frequent use of non-Euclidean space. The map was released in March 2023. Critic Jacob Geller posited the book as an inspiration behind the video games &quot;Anatomy&quot; (2016) and &quot;Control&quot; (2019), citing its reimagining of an innocuous family home as an ancient, malicious entity.

<text>The Whalestoe Letters (2000), by the American fiction author Mark Z. Danielewski, is an epistolary novella which more fully develops the literary correspondence between Pelafina H. Lièvre and her son Johnny from 1982–1989, characters first introduced in Danielewski&#x27;s prior work &quot;House of Leaves&quot;.

The letters are included in the second edition of &quot;House of Leaves&quot;, in Appendix II, under the name &quot;E – The Three Attic Whalestoe Institute Letters&quot;, although the companion piece includes eleven additional letters not found in &quot;House of Leaves&quot;.

==Plot introduction== 
Pelafina writes these letters to Johnny from &quot;The Three Attic Whalestoe Institute&quot;, a mental institution where she has been residing for a number of years. While a number of these letters appear in &quot;House of Leaves&quot;, &quot;The Whalestoe Letters&quot; introduces a number of new letters which serve to more fully develop Pelafina&#x27;s character as well as her relationship with Johnny.

<text>&quot;Angry Johnny&quot; is the debut single by Poe, released in 1995 from her debut album &quot;Hello&quot;. The song received heavy radio airplay, and an accompanying music video was shown frequently on MTV.

==Background==
Despite its success and positive critical reviews, &quot;Angry Johnny&quot; was the only commercial single released in Australia; however, a variety of promotional singles were released across the world. &quot;Angry Johnny&quot; was also included on the 1996 album &quot;Big Shiny Tunes&quot;.

Poe mentions Johnny again in her second album, &quot;Haunted&quot;, on the song &quot;Dear Johnny&quot;.

==Composition==
&quot;Angry Johnny&quot; has a slow rhythm and, like much of &quot;Hello&quot;, incorporates layered vocal tracks. The single was produced by Matt Sorum.

A &quot;Full Band Version&quot; of the song was also released, which was more acoustic than the album version and heavily featured cello.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Billboard&quot; praised the single, particularly the &quot;fun and clever sexual euphemisms&quot; of the lyrics.

==Chart performance==
&quot;Angry Johnny&quot; peaked at #7 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.

==In popular culture==
A two-second clip of &quot;Angry Johnny&quot; was included in the endpapers of the US hardcover version of Mark Z. Danielewski&#x27;s novel &quot;House of Leaves&quot;, in the form of hexadecimal numbers that, when compiled in a hex editor, could be turned into an AIFF audio file.

<text>Borders is a book and stationery retailer operating in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates by the Al Maya Group. It was founded in the United States in 1971 by brothers Tom and Louis Borders, who opened their first bookshop in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

In October 1992, it was purchased by Kmart, but then spun-off in 1995 as Borders Group, Inc. and remained headquartered in Ann Arbor, with Waldenbooks as its subsidiary. In 1997, Borders expanded into Singapore, and then later expanded into Australia and New Zealand. In 1998, Borders expanded into the United Kingdom, and then later into Ireland. In 2005, it opened in Malaysia, and in 2006, with Al Maya Group, it opened a location in the United Arab Emirates, and then further expanded across the Middle East.

In September 2007, Risk Capital Partners purchased the Borders stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland, alongside a license to use the Borders name. In June 2008, REDgroup Retail purchased the Borders stores in Singapore, Australia and New Zealand with a license to the Borders name.

In November 2009, Borders in the United Kingdom and Ireland collapsed into administration, with all stores closed by the end of the year, resulting in around 1,150 job losses. In June 2011, Borders closed in Singapore, Australia and New Zealand after its franchisor went into administration. In July 2011, Borders in the United States was liquidated after failing to find a buyer. It employed about 19,500 people throughout America, including at its Waldenbooks stores. Its final U.S. stores closed in September 2011.

In September 2011, its longtime rival Barnes &amp; Noble acquired the Borders trademark and other intellectual property assets. The Malaysian and Middle East Borders operations continued to trade under renewed franchise deals with Barnes &amp; Noble, as well as a failed attempt in 2013 to re-establish the brand in Singapore. In 2015, Al Maya Group purchased the regional Borders trademark rights outright from Barnes &amp; Noble, and subsequently diversified it into a merchandise mix consisting of books, toys and stationery. The Malaysian Borders franchises closed down in July 2023. 

==History==

The original Borders bookstore was located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States, where it was founded in 1971 by brothers Tom and Louis Borders during their undergraduate and graduate years at the University of Michigan. The first Borders bookshop opened at 209 South State Street, Ann Arbor, in 1971.

In 1975, they bought out the stock of Wahr&#x27;s, an 80-year-old bookstore that was ending business at 316 South State Street, and hired Michael Hildebrand and Harvey James Robin to stock it with rare books and manage the old shop. Hildebrand had managed Gibson&#x27;s used and rare book department in East Lansing for years and Harvey Robin had been a local restorer of rare books, who moved his bindery upstairs. Wahr&#x27;s had primarily been a textbook and school supplies vendor, but the brothers did not deal in textbooks. They moved the retail bookshop to much larger quarters that had become available down the street at 303 South State, in the former location of the Wagner and Son men&#x27;s clothing store. The old shop was renamed Charing Cross Bookshop and Tom Frick was sent over from the new bookshop to help.

In 1985, the company opened its second location, in Beverly Hills, Michigan.

The downtown Ann Arbor store moved across the street again in 1994 to 612 East Liberty Street, at the southwest corner of Liberty and State Streets, in the building once occupied by the defunct Jacobson&#x27;s Department Store. Although not the original location, it was identified as &quot;Borders #1&quot; because it was the flagship store.

Former Hickory Farms president Robert F. DiRomualdo was hired in 1989 to expand the company.

===Kmart and Waldenbooks===
Borders was acquired in 1992 by Kmart, which had acquired mall-based book chain Waldenbooks eight years earlier. Kmart had struggled with the book division, having first tinkered with the assortment and later with discounting. In the Borders acquisition, Kmart merged the two companies in hopes that the experienced Borders senior management could bail out floundering Waldenbooks. Instead, many of the Borders senior management team left the company, leaving behind an even larger and more unwieldy division for Kmart executives to handle on the heels of aggressive expansions by rivals Barnes &amp; Noble and Crown Books. Facing its own fiscal problems and intense pressure from stockholders, Kmart spun off Borders in 1995, in a highly structured stock-purchase plan. The newly formed company was initially called Borders-Walden Group and, by the end of the same year, renamed simply Borders Group.

In 1994, Borders briefly operated a mall-based toy store called All Wound Up, which sold toys and novelty items. Most All Wound Up stores were seasonal kiosks in shopping malls.

Borders was rumoured to open stores in Canada, starting with a retail store in Toronto. However, this was rejected for failing to meet Canadian ownership regulations for book retailers.

At one point, the highest-grossing location in US territory was a remodeled and expanded store in Puerto Rico, generating $17 million in sales annually. Another notably large and successful location in the U.S. was located at 5 World Trade Center in New York City, but the store sustained damage and was closed following the September 11 attacks.
===Changes in business plan===
In 1998, Philip Pfeffer succeeded Robert DiRomualdo as chief executive.

In 2003, Borders had 1,249 stores using the Borders and Waldenbooks names.

In 2004, Borders reached an agreement with Starbucks subsidiary Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee to operate cafes in its domestic superstores under the Seattle&#x27;s Best brand name.

In March 2007, Borders Group announced it would scale down the number of Waldenbooks outlets it had by half, to about 300, in the next year.
In 2008, Borders opened 14 concept stores nationwide, which included a Digital Center, offering select electronic devices such as MP3 players, digital photo frames, and the Sony Reader. The concept stores were located in Ann Arbor, Michigan; Denver, Colorado; Las Vegas, Nevada; Panama City Beach, Florida; Noblesville, Indiana; Monroeville, Pennsylvania; and Alameda, California. The latest Borders Digital Center opened in Alameda in January 2008.

In late 2007, Borders installed digital video monitors in select stores. The monitors displayed special programs, as well as news, sports, and financial information provided through Ripple Networks, Inc., a California-based marketing service.

Borders Group also launched a customer appreciation program called Borders Rewards. In contrast to a membership from Barnes &amp; Noble, which was a paid-for membership that entitled customers to discounts, Borders Rewards was a free program with discount coupons and the ability to earn store credit for purchases. In addition, in September 2009, following the lead of Barnes &amp; Noble, the chain discontinued its fee-based wireless service provided by T-Mobile and began implementing a free Wi-Fi network provided by Verizon.

===Declining profits===
The last year that Borders made a profit was in 2006. Its yearly income dropped by $1 billion over the next four years.

In March 2007, the company announced the end of its marketing alliance with Amazon begun six years earlier, as well as plans to launch its own online business in early 2008.

In March 2008, Borders Group announced the intention to sell the chain because of financial difficulties. Borders Books was rumored to have approached Barnes &amp; Noble in hopes of a buyout. The chain was in debt, having increased its financial instability by borrowing US$42.5 million in March from Pershing Square Capital Management, the company&#x27;s major stockholder, to keep the company running through the remainder of the fiscal year. The loan was said to have a very high interest rate of 12.5%, which meant that the chain would have to post a significant profit to stay afloat in the future. Following the announcement of the loan, Borders&#x27;s shares dropped 28.6% to $5.07/share. The shares continued to drop throughout the year, and as of December 11, 2009, Borders stocks were trading at $1.30 on the NYSE, which was up almost a point from a low of $0.530 on January 28, 2009.
On January 5, 2009, the company announced that Ron Marshall would immediately take over as chief executive. Former CEO George L. Jones received a severance package of $2.09 million. Mark Bierley was also promoted to chief financial officer, replacing Ed Wilhelm. The changes in management were due to Borders&#x27;s holiday sales having fallen by 11.7% to $868.8 million. On January 13, Mick McGuire, a former partner at Pershing Square, became chairman of the board of directors.

On March 30, 2009, Marshall announced that the loan from Pershing Square would be extended for another year (coming due on April 1, 2010), at an interest rate of 9.8%. This, combined with a series of layoffs and new promotional deals with major publishers, caused Borders stock to rise. Within a week, it had topped the $1.00 mark. By mid-April, it had approached $2.00. As a result, the company cancelled plans to ask its shareholders for permission to perform a reverse stock split.

On August 11, 2009, Borders revealed the names of the replacements for five of the eight members of the board of directors, who had previously announced their intentions to quit. The new members included Paul J. Brown of Hilton Hotels, Timothy V. Wolf of MillerCoors, and Dan Rose of Facebook.

On November 5, 2009, Borders announced that it would close some of its Waldenbooks stores in an effort to improve the profitability of its Specialty Retail operations. By January 2010, 182 stores had been closed.

Holiday sales figures for 2009 were &quot;disappointing&quot;, with total sales of $846.8 million, (~$ in ) down 14.7% from the previous year. Employees reported that major cuts were made in payroll hours.

At the beginning of 2010, the company operated 511 Borders superstores in the United States. The company also operated 175 stores in the Waldenbooks Specialty Retail segment, including Waldenbooks, Borders Express, Borders airport stores, and Borders Outlet stores. 

On January 26, 2010, CEO Ron Marshall resigned to become president and CEO of The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. (A&amp;P). Following his announcement, Borders stock fell below one dollar per share. During his tenure at Borders, all of the top executive officers resigned (or were encouraged to leave), including some who had been with the company for over 20 years. Mike Edwards (vice president and chief merchandising officer) was appointed interim CEO.

On March 31, 2010, Borders announced that the loan from Pershing Square had been paid in full. In early April, the company&#x27;s stock had rebounded to $2.78 per share.

On May 21, 2010, it was revealed that Bennett S. LeBow, chairman of Vector Group, was making a large private investment in Borders stock. As a result, both LeBow and Howard Lorber, president and CEO of Vector Group, joined the board of directors. Following the resignation of chairman Mick McGuire, LeBow was elected chairman of the board. On June 3, LeBow became CEO of Borders Group. Mike Edwards was confirmed as president of Borders Group and CEO of Borders, Inc., the company&#x27;s principal subsidiary.

The company reported significant losses for the third quarter, compared to 2009. At the end of 2010, &quot;Business Week&quot; and BBC News reported that Borders would be delaying its payments to publishers for inventory already received, to preserve liquidity. This was prompted by problems in refinancing its credit facilities.

===Bankruptcy and liquidation===
On February 16, 2011, the company announced that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, listing $1.275 billion in assets and $1.293 billion in debts in its filing. The company also announced the liquidation and closing of 226 stores. Two private-equity firms, The Gores Group and Najafi Companies, expressed interest in purchasing half of the remaining Borders Group stores.

Despite a purchase offer from the private equity firm Najafi Companies, Borders was not able to find a buyer acceptable to its creditors before its July bidding deadline, so it began liquidating its remaining 399 retail outlets, with the last remaining stores closing in September. The Chapter 11 case was ultimately converted to Chapter 7. Rival bookseller Barnes &amp; Noble acquired Borders&#x27;s trademarks and customer list.

Borders Group announced on July 1, 2011, that it had found a bidder, Direct Brands, that would acquire the assets for $215 million and the assumption of $220 million in debt.
A group of Borders creditors rejected the Direct Brands takeover bid in July 2011. Borders filed for an auction and the motion was approved by a judge; however, the bid deadline expired on July 17 without a bidder. A United States bankruptcy judge approved a petition to liquidate; this resulted in the company converting their Chapter 11 case to Chapter 7. On July 22, 2011, Borders started closing its remaining 399 stores with a phased roll-out. Business operations ceased in September 2011. Former rival and the current second-largest chain of bookstores in the United States, Books-A-Million, had made a bid to acquire 30 to 35 stores and their assets on July 19, 2011, the day liquidation was approved by the courts. However, the two sides were unable to come to an agreement suitable to all parties.

Books-A-Million later resurrected its offer to buy portions of Borders Group, purchasing the leases for 21 stores primarily in New England and Pennsylvania.
Borders USA closed its remaining stores on Sunday, September 18, 2011.
The Borders online store closed on September 27, 2011, at 10:30 pm Eastern. A banner then appeared on their website allowing users to browse, but directed them to Barnes &amp; Noble to complete their purchases. All Borders customers had until October 29, 2011, to prevent their personal contact and purchase information from being transferred to Barnes &amp; Noble. On October 1, 2011, Borders cardholders were informed by email: &quot;As part of Borders ceasing operations, we Barnes &amp; Noble acquired some of its assets including Borders brand trademarks and their customer list.&quot; The federal bankruptcy court approved this sale on September 26, 2011.

== International operations ==

=== Malaysia (defunct) ===
In April 2005, Borders Group opened its first franchise store with Malaysia&#x27;s Berjaya Books Sdn. Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. It was located in Berjaya Times Square, which is the world&#x27;s biggest mall built in a single phase, with . The store in Berjaya Times Square was advertised as being the world&#x27;s biggest Borders at ; however, this changed with the closure of one level of the store. Borders&#x27;s second store in Malaysia was located in The Curve, Mutiara Damansara. The third Borders store opened in Queensbay Mall, Penang on December 7, 2006 and closed on 26th December 2019. 

=== Middle East (present) ===
Borders opened a franchise store in the Mall of the Emirates in Dubai, UAE in October 2006. Despite financial difficulties in the domestic market, Borders continued to expand its franchises, adding stores in Oman and Sharjah.

By the end of 2009, all of Borders&#x27;s directly owned overseas locations had been sold or closed, leaving only the franchise stores in Dubai and Oman.

However, international Borders stores are still operating in Middle Eastern countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait. These Borders stores are now under different ownership from the original Borders Group, and were unaffected by their store closures. In Dubai, Al Maya Group purchased lifetime rights to the Borders brand in the Middle East in 2015, and subsequently diversified it into a merchandise mix consisting of books, toys and stationery.

=== Singapore, Australia and New Zealand (defunct) ===
In 1997, the company established its first international store in Singapore, occupying in Wheelock Place, Orchard Road, which was then the largest bookstore there.

In the third quarter of 2006, the Singapore store emerged as the best performing among the group&#x27;s 559 outlets, with the highest revenue generated per square meter.

To pay off debt, Borders sold all of its Australian, New Zealand and Singaporean stores to Pacific Equity Partners (owner of competitor Angus &amp; Robertson) in 2008. A new company called REDgroup Retail was formed. After this transaction, the Borders stores in the US, the UK (which had also been sold off to another company but closed down in 2009 due to entering administration) and the Asia/Pacific region were owned by three wholly independent entities.

In late July 2012, Pearson Australia Group decided to re-brand the former Borders website as Bookworld.
Chief Executive James Webber told The Australian &quot;The Borders brand had lost its former sheen. We just believe the Borders brand has had its day. There are no stores left and globally it&#x27;s been in demise so we believe there&#x27;s an opportunity to revitalise (the franchise) and move it forward.&quot;

All of its existing customer base was migrated over to the new Bookworld website. The Bookworld brand was itself also later rebranded as Angus &amp; Robertson.

The Australian, New Zealand, and Singaporean stores were sold in June 2008 to Pacific Equity Partners (who also own local competitor Angus &amp; Robertson), which then formed a new company, RedGroup Retail, to pay off debt.

Borders Group also formerly operated stores in Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore. However, these were sold off to Pacific Equity Partners (which owned rival Angus &amp; Robertson) in 2008, then were later sold again to REDgroup Retail. The stores continued to operate under the Borders brand as the unaffiliated &quot;Borders Asia Pacific&quot; until RedGroup was placed into voluntary administration in February 2011; with the five New Zealand stores sold to the James Pascoe Group and the Australian stores gradually shut down, with the last group closing in July 2011.

On 6 April, RedGroup Retail announced that 16 of the 25 remaining Borders stores in Australia were to close within two months. The handling of the administration prompted 25 franchised Angus &amp; Robertson stores to sever ties with RedGroup, rebranding themselves as independents. By the end of May, 70 of the 87 RedGroup-owned bookstores in New Zealand had been sold off: ten airport-based Whitcoulls stores to Australian-based LS Travel Retail Pacific, and another 57 Whitcoulls plus five Borders stores to the James Pascoe Group.

On 17 February 2011, REDgroup Retail (including the Borders, Angus &amp; Robertson as well as Whitcoulls chains) were placed into voluntary administration with Ferrier Hodgson appointed as administrators. The immediate aftermath of the announcement saw the closure of 48 Angus &amp; Robertson stores and one Borders store. The day after the announcement, customers of the surviving stores were informed that gift vouchers could only be redeemed if they also spent an equivalent amount in cash. After 3 April, unused vouchers became void.

On 2 June 2011, the administrator announced the closure of the remaining nine Borders stores, as no buyer could be found. All stores in Australia were closed by July 2011.

The flagship Borders store at Wheelock Place in Singapore was suddenly closed on 16 August 2011, and was forced to clear out by 23 August 2011. Vouchers and gift cards from Borders Singapore bookstore were no longer accepted. After hearing that the Borders store at Wheelock Place was shutting down, some people tried to use their vouchers on the Saturday at its other outlet at Parkway Parade, but they were not allowed to do so. The books were cleared at a sale held at Singapore Expo Hall 4B, from 10am to 10pm, from 2 September 2011 to 6 September 2011. The remaining store closed on 26 September 2011 at 9 p.m., ending 14 years of sales in Singapore, just before the lease was due to end in October, but not before discounts of 70% to clear all items which started three days before its closure. On the last hours of its business in Singapore, shelves, signs, baskets and computers at the cashiers&#x27; counters were also available for sale.

====Stores====
In total Borders had 33 stores located across Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. All were closed due to the demise of the parent company REDgroup Retail.
The last remaining Singaporean Borders store in Parkway Parade Shopping Center, closed its doors at 9 pm (Singapore time) after a final sale on Monday, September 26, 2011. 

The Borders brand in Singapore was purchased by Popular Holdings in late 2012. In an attempt to revive the brand, a single Borders store opened in Westgate for a trial period in 2013, but that store was shortly after converted to a regular Popular book store.

=== United Kingdom and Ireland (defunct) ===
In the United Kingdom, Borders bought 35 Books etc. stores from Philip and Richard Joseph.

In 1998, Borders (UK) Ltd. was established as a Borders Group subsidiary and with its Borders and Books etc. After quickly becoming one of the country&#x27;s leading booksellers, due to the fierce competition in the UK marketplace, a number of the Books etc. stores closed, and Borders (UK) Ltd. was sold in 2007 to a private-equity investor. The chain won numerous awards including Bookselling Chain of the Year 2005 &amp; 2006, Chain Bookselling Company of the Year 2006 &amp; 2007, Hachette Children&#x27;s Retailer of the Year 2007, Magazine Destination Retailer of the Year 2007 and Usborne Children&#x27;s Bookseller of the Year 2008

In March 2007, Borders Group announced the disposal of its Ireland and UK businesses, including its Books etc. business in the UK, with the aim of revitalizing the core US business; however, it was also announced that Borders Group would retain the Paperchase stationery business. International expansion would be likely to continue via franchising.

A typical Borders shop in the UK contained both a Paperchase stationery and Starbucks cafe concession. In addition, some branches also contained a RED5 gadget concession and GAME video games concession.
In September 2007, Borders (UK) Ltd. was acquired by Luke Johnson&#x27;s London-based private equity investor Risk Capital Partners in a deal purportedly worth £20 million. Bookshop Acquisitions Ltd. - a subsidiary of Risk Capital Partners - was specifically set up for the purchase, and the deal included the right to use the Borders and Books etc. brand names consistent with the brand. Under the deal, Borders would receive an equity interest of about 17% in Bookshop Acquisitions. It was announced that the 42 Borders and 28 Books etc. stores in Ireland and the UK had been sold to private-equity group Risk Capital Partners for an initial £20 million. However, after changing hands in 2009, Borders in Ireland and the UK went into administration on November 26, 2009. 

David Roche stepped down as CEO of Borders (UK) in January 2008, and was replaced by the chain&#x27;s former managing director, Philip Downer. Upon his appointment, Downer called for a category review of the entire company, although he made it clear there were no immediate plans to further change the structure of the business.

Subsequently, it was announced in March 2008 that Borders (UK) planned to close its distribution centre (based in Cornwall) on 29 August, in favour of having publishers and wholesalers deliver directly to its shops, this being exactly opposite to the decision of competitor Waterstones, which planned to test and open its own distribution centre, colloquially referred to as &#x27;The Hub&#x27;, from the end of May.

In July 2008, Borders launched an e-commerce website. In a bid to try to take back a share of internet sales of books, the beta testing of its new transactional website commenced, due for full completion before the end of the month. As of May 2022, Books Etc. still operates as an independent family-run online business.

Borders sold eight London Books Etc. shops to Waterstones in August 2008, for an undisclosed sum.

Five Borders shops in Oxford Street, Llantrisant, Blanchardstown, Swindon and London Colney were closed in July 2009 and replaced by New Look. After July 2009, Borders was owned by Valco Capital Partners, part of Hilco, which specialises in distressed retailers.

At the end of September 2009, it was announced that the majority of the remaining Books Etc., and the two Borders Express shops, would be sold, and closing down sales began shortly after.

==== Administration ====
The company announced in November 2009 that it was looking for a buyer for the business following concerns that it would run out of money. The following day the Borders website stopped taking orders for books, while orders for CDs and DVDs through the Borders Entertainment website continued, for this was run by The Hut Group.

On 26 November 2009, Reuters announced that Borders (UK) had entered administration, after reportedly having difficulties raising enough cash to trade through the key Christmas period. This article was soon withdrawn, and replaced with a corrected item reporting that the company was &#x27;mulling&#x27; administration. This news came on top of a difficult few weeks for the company, with the company reported to be on credit stop with all the major publishers, and (following the breakdown of negotiations with WHSmith) still searching for a buyer.

Later that day, Borders (UK) Ltd officially went into administration. Initially the intention was to appoint BDO as administrators, but it developed that a conflict of interest existed. Instead, MCR was appointed by Borders&#x27; owners—Valco Capital Partners, part of Hilco—as administrators. The BBC adds that MCR &#x27;hired specialist liquidators Hilco to advise&#x27;. A &#x27;parallel strategy&#x27; was applied of seeking a buyer for the chain as a going interest, and running closing-down sales.

On the evening of 27 November 2009, it was announced that a closing-down sale would commence in all stores on the following day. During the sales, sale stock included Denby China, a separate concern bought out by Valco Capital Partners earlier in 2009. The publisher Hachette successfully took MCR to court for continuing to sell Hachette titles without first obtaining permission, obtaining a High Court judgement on 18 December 2009 that MCR was &#x27;incorrect&#x27; to do so.

MCR, the administrator for the chain, stated the intention of seeking a buyer. However, it was reported that a &#x27;serious attempt&#x27; by Richard Joseph, co-founder of the Books Etc. chain, to buy a number of stores was rejected by MCR. A spokesman for MCR confirmed that unsuccessful bids had been made which had failed to meet expectations. MCR announced that the 45 stores would cease trading and close their doors permanently on 22 December, claiming that it had not been possible to sell the chain as a going concern. All staff members were made redundant on 24 December 2009. The company Borders (UK) Limited was dissolved in August 2011.

On November 26, 2009, Borders (UK) Ltd was placed into administration, which is the equivalent to Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States. At that time, the Borders bookshop chain in the UK started a closing down sale in all of its 45 stores. On December 14, Borders UK converted to liquidation (which is equivalent to Chapter 7 in the US) and announced it was going out of business. All UK stores were closed by the end of the year.

By the end of December 2009, Borders employed an estimated 1,150 staff across its UK stores, which went into bankruptcy administration before the end of 2009. After failing to find a buyer, all the stores were shut on December 22, 2009. 

The BOOKS etc. name and its website and the Borders database were bought by Capital Books Ltd in January 2010. As of May 2022, Books Etc. still operates as an independent family-run online business. The logo contained both the Books etc. logo and the Borders logo to reflect the fact that Borders (UK) operated two different brands.

==eBook store==
On July 7, 2010, Borders opened an eBook store to allow books to be directly downloaded to an e-reader device or a Borders eReader app for the desktop, iPhone, iPad, BlackBerry, or Android. Although branded as a Borders store, it was actually handled by Kobo, Inc.

On June 3, 2011, the Borders eReader apps were changed to Kobo eReader apps and users could transfer their Borders eBooks to their Kobo library.

<doc id="90123" wikidata="Q16843370" url="?curid=90123" title="Hey Pretty">
<text>&quot;Hey Pretty&quot; is a song by singer-songwriter Poe. The song in its original version, on her 2000 album &quot;Haunted&quot;, was a sultry pop rant of a woman seeking sexual satisfaction by any means necessary. It was remade with most of her vocals eliminated and replaced with a reading by her brother, author Mark Z. Danielewski, from his hit book &quot;House of Leaves&quot;. This new version became a moderate radio hit.

Getting &quot;Hey Pretty&quot; on the radio was a challenge in 2001 as alternative radio was playing few female-led acts in the post-Lilith Fair backlash. In an interview with MTV, Poe explained the way in which the Drive-By Remix came about: &quot;Radio was not interested. I called a few program directors, and they [said], &#x27;We really love the record, but we&#x27;re just not playing women.&#x27; This one [program director] in Portland, Oregon [94.7 KNRK&#x27;s Mark Hamilton], said, &#x27;My station is basically in the same boat. Do some crazy mix that you think will fit this format, and I&#x27;ll play it once.&#x27; I go home, and I&#x27;m like, &#x27;They&#x27;re not playing women? Fine, I&#x27;ve got a brother.&#x27; So I called my brother, and I&#x27;m like, &#x27;You gotta come over and read a piece of your book in this song.&#x27;... (The DJ) played it and got inundated with phone calls. By the end of the week he had played it 25 times, which wouldn&#x27;t have meant all that much because it&#x27;s a small station in Portland. But the next week, KROQ in Los Angeles had it. ...&quot;

There are at least two different versions. One ends with the line, &quot;Dark Languages Rarely Survive,&quot; followed by a woman saying, &quot;Das nicht zu Hause sein&quot; twice. This is German for &quot;Not being at home&quot;, a recurring phrase in the book &quot;House of Leaves&quot;.

The second ending has that line followed by Poe coming back in with the chorus. The video, directed by Matthew Rolston, features erotic imagery of a scantily-dressed Poe washing, driving, and lounging on a vintage car along with a look-alike model with a similar build, hair, and identical outfit. The car scenes are interlaced with shots of Mark Danielewski performing the spoken-word portions of the song, as well as footage of Poe and her look-alike mud wrestling.
The song was featured on the soundtrack to the MTV original series Spyder Games.

In January 2009 Ford began using the original version of the song in television commercials.
