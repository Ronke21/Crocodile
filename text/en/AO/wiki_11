<text>Terrance Stanley Fox (July 28, 1958June 28, 1981) was a Canadian athlete, humanitarian, and cancer research activist. In 1980, having had one leg amputated due to cancer, he embarked on a cross-Canada run to raise money and awareness for cancer research. The annual Terry Fox Run, first held in 1981, has grown to involve millions of participants in over 60 countries and is now the world&#x27;s largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research; over C$850 million has been raised in his name as of September 2022.

Fox was a distance runner and basketball player for his high school, now named after him, and Simon Fraser University. His right leg was amputated in 1977 after he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, though he continued to run using an artificial leg. He also played wheelchair basketball in Vancouver, winning three national championships.

In 1980, he began the Marathon of Hope to raise money for cancer research. He hoped to raise one dollar from each of Canada&#x27;s 24 million people. He began with little fanfare from St John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, in April and ran the equivalent of a full marathon every day. Fox had become a national star by the time he reached Ontario; he made numerous public appearances with businessmen, athletes, and politicians in his efforts to raise money. He was forced to end his run outside Thunder Bay when the cancer spread to his lungs. His hopes of overcoming the disease and completing his run ended when he died nine months later.

Fox was the youngest person named a Companion of the Order of Canada and won the 1980 Lou Marsh Award as the nation&#x27;s top sportsman. He was named Canada&#x27;s Newsmaker of the Year in both 1980 and 1981 by The Canadian Press. Considered a national hero, he has had many buildings, statues, roads, and parks named in his honour across the country.

==Early life and cancer==
Terry Fox was born on July 28, 1958, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to Rolland and Betty Fox. Rolland was a switchman for the Canadian National Railway. Fox spent his childhood in the Transcona suburb of Winnipeg, where he attended Wayoata Elementary School. Fox had an elder brother, Fred, a younger brother, Darrell, and a younger sister, Judith. Fox&#x27;s maternal grandmother is Métis and Fox&#x27;s younger brother Darrell has official Métis status.

His family moved to Surrey in British Columbia in 1966, then settled in Port Coquitlam in 1968. He had doting parents, and his father recalled that Fox was extremely competitive. Fox attempted to join his school&#x27;s basketball team, though struggled because of his height. His coach suggested that Fox try cross-country running, which Fox did in order to impress his coach. Fox continued to improve on his basketball skills, and in grade 12 he won his high school&#x27;s athlete of the year award. Fox was unsure whether he wanted to go to university, but Fox&#x27;s mother convinced him to enrol at Simon Fraser University. He studied kinesiology with the intention of becoming a physical education teacher. He was also a member of the junior varsity basketball team.
On November 12, 1976, Fox was driving to the family home in Port Coquitlam when he was distracted by nearby bridge construction and crashed into the back of a pickup truck. Fox injured his right knee in the crash and felt pain in December, but chose to ignore it until the end of basketball season. By March 1977, the pain had intensified and he went to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of cancer that often starts near the knees. Fox believed his car accident weakened his knee and left it vulnerable to the disease, though his doctors argued there was no connection. He was told that his leg had to be amputated, he would require chemotherapy treatment, and that recent medical advances meant he had a 50-percent chance of survival. Fox learned that two years before, the figure would have been only 15 percent; the improvement in survival rates impressed on him the value of cancer research. With the help of an artificial leg, Fox was walking three weeks after the amputation. Doctors were impressed with Fox&#x27;s positive outlook, stating it contributed to his rapid recovery. Fox endured sixteen months of chemotherapy and found the time he spent in the British Columbia Cancer Control Agency facility difficult as he watched fellow cancer patients suffer and die from the disease. 

In the summer of 1977, Rick Hansen, working with the Canadian Wheelchair Sports Association, invited Fox to try out for his wheelchair basketball team. Less than two months after learning how to play the sport, Fox was named a member of the team for the national championship in Edmonton, Alberta He won three national titles with the team, and was named an all-star by the North American Wheelchair Basketball Association in 1980.

==Marathon of Hope==

The night before his cancer surgery, Fox had been given an article about Dick Traum, the first amputee to complete the New York City Marathon. The article inspired him; he embarked on a 14-month training program, telling his family he planned to compete in a marathon himself. In private, he devised a more extensive plan. His hospital experiences had made Fox angry at how little money was dedicated to cancer research. He intended to run the length of Canada in the hope of increasing cancer awareness, a goal he initially divulged only to his friend Douglas Alward.

Fox ran with an unusual gait, as he was required to hop-step on his good leg due to the extra time the springs in his artificial leg required to reset after each step. He found the training painful as the additional pressure he had to place on both his good leg and his stump led to bone bruises, blisters and intense pain. Fox found that after about 20 minutes of each run, he crossed a pain threshold and the run became easier.

On September 2, 1979, Fox competed in a road race in Prince George. He finished in last place, ten minutes behind his closest competitor, but his effort was met with tears and applause from the other participants. Following the marathon, he revealed his full plan to his family. His mother discouraged him, angering Fox, though she later came to support the project. She recalled, &quot;He said, &#x27;I thought you&#x27;d be one of the first persons to believe in me.&#x27; And I wasn&#x27;t. I was the first person who let him down&quot;. Fox initially hoped to raise $1 million, then $10 million, but later sought to raise $1 for each of Canada&#x27;s 24 million citizens.

===Preparation===
On October 15, 1979, Fox sent a letter to the Canadian Cancer Society in which he announced his goal and appealed for funding. He stated that he would &quot;conquer&quot; his disability, and promised to complete his run, even if he had to &quot;crawl every last mile&quot;. Explaining why he wanted to raise money for research, Fox described his personal experience of cancer treatment:

Fox closed his letter with the statement: &quot;We need your help. The people in cancer clinics all over the world need people who believe in miracles. I am not a dreamer, and I am not saying that this will initiate any kind of definitive answer or cure to cancer. I believe in miracles. I have to.&quot;

The Cancer Society was skeptical of his success but agreed to support Fox once he had acquired sponsors and requested he get a medical certificate from a heart specialist stating that he was fit to attempt the run. Fox was diagnosed with left ventricular hypertrophy – an enlarged heart – a condition commonly associated with athletes. Doctors warned Fox of the potential risks he faced, though they did not consider his condition a significant concern. They endorsed his participation when he promised that he would stop immediately if he began to experience any heart problems.

A second letter was sent to several corporations seeking donations for a vehicle and running shoes, and to cover the other costs of the run. Fox sent other letters asking for grants to buy a running leg. The Ford Motor Company donated a camper van, while Imperial Oil contributed fuel, and Adidas his running shoes. Fox turned away any company that requested he endorse their products and refused any donation that carried conditions, as he insisted that nobody was to profit from his run.

===Start of the marathon===

The Marathon began on April 12, 1980, when Fox dipped his right leg in the Atlantic Ocean near St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, and filled two large bottles with ocean water. He intended to keep one as a souvenir and pour the other into the Pacific Ocean upon completing his journey at Victoria, British Columbia. Fox was supported on his run by Doug Alward, who drove the van and cooked meals.

Fox was met with gale-force winds, heavy rain, and a snowstorm in the first days of his run. He was initially disappointed with the reception he received but was heartened upon arriving in Channel-Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador, where the town&#x27;s 10,000 residents presented him with a donation of over $10,000. Throughout the trip, Fox frequently expressed his anger and frustration to those he saw as impeding the run, and he fought regularly with Alward. When they reached Nova Scotia, they were barely on speaking terms, and it was arranged for Fox&#x27;s brother Darrell, then 17, to join them as a buffer.

Fox left the Maritimes on June 10 and faced new challenges upon entering Quebec due to his group&#x27;s inability to speak French and drivers who continually forced him off the road. Fox arrived in Montreal on June 22, one-third of the way through his journey, having collected over $200,000 in donations. Fox&#x27;s run caught the attention of Isadore Sharp, the founder and CEO of Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, who lost a son to melanoma in 1978 just a year after Terry&#x27;s diagnosis. Sharp gave food and accommodation at his hotels to Fox&#x27;s team. When Fox was discouraged because so few people were making donations, Sharp pledged $2 a mile and persuaded close to 1,000 other corporations to do the same. Fox was convinced by the Canadian Cancer Society that arriving in Ottawa for Canada Day would aid fundraising efforts, so he remained in Montreal for a few extra days.

===Ontario and marathon&#x27;s end===

Fox crossed into Ontario on the last Saturday in June, and he was met by a brass band and thousands of residents who lined the streets to cheer him on, while the Ontario Provincial Police gave him an escort throughout the province. Despite the sweltering heat of summer, he continued to run per day. On his arrival in Ottawa, Fox met Governor General Ed Schreyer, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and was the guest of honour at numerous sporting events in the city. In front of 16,000 fans, he performed a ceremonial kickoff at a Canadian Football League game and was given a standing ovation. Fox&#x27;s journal reflected his growing excitement at the reception he had received.

On July 11, Fox arrived in Toronto where a crowd of 10,000 people met Fox, who was to be honoured in Nathan Phillips Square. As he ran to the square, he was joined on the road by many people, including National Hockey League star Darryl Sittler, who presented Fox with his 1980 All-Star Game jersey. The Cancer Society estimated it collected $100,000 in donations that day alone. That evening he threw the ceremonial first pitch at Exhibition Stadium preceding a baseball game between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Cleveland Indians. As he continued through southern Ontario, he was met by Hockey Hall of Fame Hockey player Bobby Orr who presented him with a cheque for $25,000. Fox considered meeting Orr the highlight of his journey.

As Fox&#x27;s fame grew, the Cancer Society scheduled him to attend more functions and give more speeches. Fox attempted to accommodate any request that he believed would raise money, no matter how far out of his way it took him. He bristled, however, at what he felt were media intrusions into his personal life, for example when the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported that he had gone on a date. Fox was left unsure whom he could trust in the media after negative articles began to emerge, including one by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that highlighted tensions with his brother Darrell and claimed he was running because he held a grudge against a doctor who had misdiagnosed his condition, allegations he referred to as &quot;trash&quot;.

The physical demands of running a marathon every day took their toll on Fox&#x27;s body. Apart from the rest days in Montreal taken at the request of the Cancer Society, he refused to take a day off, even on his 22nd birthday. He frequently had shin splints and an inflamed knee. He developed cysts on his stump and experienced dizzy spells. At one point, he had a soreness in his ankle that would not go away. Although he feared he had developed a stress fracture, he ran for three more days before seeking medical attention, and was then relieved to learn it was tendonitis and could be treated with painkillers. Fox rejected calls for him to seek regular medical checkups, and dismissed suggestions he was risking his future health. By late August, Fox described that he was exhausted before he began the day&#x27;s run. On September 1, outside Thunder Bay, he was forced to stop briefly after he had an intense coughing fit and experienced pains in his chest. He resumed running as the crowds along the highway shouted out their encouragement. A few miles later, short of breath and with continued chest pain, he asked Alward to drive him to a hospital. The next day, Fox held a tearful press conference during which he announced that his cancer had returned and spread to his lungs. He was forced to end his run after 143 days and . Fox refused offers to complete the run in his stead, stating that he wanted to complete his marathon himself.

===National response===
Fox had raised $1.7 million (equivalent to $ million in ) when he was forced to abandon the Marathon. A week after his run ended, the CTV Television Network organized a nationwide telethon in support of Fox and the Canadian Cancer Society. Supported by Canadian and international celebrities, the five-hour event raised $10.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Among the donations were $1 million each by the governments of British Columbia and Ontario, the former to create a new research institute to be founded in Fox&#x27;s name and the latter an endowment given to the Ontario Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation. Donations continued throughout the winter, and by April over $23 million had been raised (equivalent to $ million in ).

Supporters and well-wishers from around the world inundated Fox with letters and tokens of support. At one point, he was receiving more mail than the rest of Port Coquitlam combined. Such was his fame that one letter sent from the United States addressed simply to &quot;Terry Fox, Canada&quot; was successfully delivered.

In September 1980, Fox was invested in a special ceremony as a Companion of the Order of Canada; he was, and remains, the youngest person to be so honoured. The Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia named him to the Order of the Dogwood, the province&#x27;s highest award. Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame commissioned a permanent exhibit, and Fox was named the winner of the Lou Marsh Award for 1980 as the nation&#x27;s top athlete. He was named Canada&#x27;s 1980 Newsmaker of the Year. The &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; described the national response to his marathon as &quot;one of the most powerful outpourings of emotion and generosity in Canada&#x27;s history&quot;.

==Illness and death==

In the following months, Fox received multiple chemotherapy treatments, but the disease continued to spread. As his condition worsened, Canadians hoped for a miracle and Pope John Paul II sent a telegram saying that he was praying for Fox. Doctors turned to experimental interferon treatments, though their effectiveness against osteogenic sarcoma was unknown. He had an adverse reaction to his first treatment, but continued the program after a period of rest.

Fox was re-admitted to the Royal Columbian Hospital in New Westminster on June 19, 1981, with chest congestion and developed pneumonia. He fell into a coma and died at 4:35 a.m. PDT on June 28, 1981. The Government of Canada ordered flags across the country lowered to half mast, an unprecedented honour that was usually reserved for statesmen. Addressing the House of Commons, Trudeau said, &quot;It occurs very rarely in the life of a nation that the courageous spirit of one person unites all people in the celebration of his life and in the mourning of his death ... We do not think of him as one who was defeated by misfortune but as one who inspired us with the example of the triumph of the human spirit over adversity&quot;.

His funeral in Port Coquitlam was attended by 40 relatives and 200 guests, and broadcast on national television. Hundreds of communities across Canada also held memorial services, a public memorial service was held on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, and Canadians again overwhelmed Cancer Society offices with donations. Fox is buried at Port Coquitlam Municipal Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Fox remains a prominent figure in Canadian folklore. His determination united the nation; people from all walks of life lent their support to his run and his memory inspires pride in all regions of the country. A 1999 national survey named him as Canada&#x27;s greatest hero, and he finished second to Tommy Douglas in the 2004 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation program &quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot;. Fox&#x27;s heroic status has been attributed to his image as an ordinary person attempting a remarkable and inspirational feat. Others have argued that Fox&#x27;s greatness derives from his audacious vision, his determined pursuit of his goal, his ability to overcome challenges such as his lack of experience and the very loneliness of his venture. As Fox&#x27;s advocate on &quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot;, media personality Sook-Yin Lee compared him to a classic hero, Phidippides, the runner who delivered the news of the Battle of Marathon before dying, and asserted that Fox &quot;embodies the most cherished Canadian values: compassion, commitment, perseverance&quot;. She highlighted the juxtaposition between his celebrity, brought about by the unforgettable image he created, and his rejection of the trappings of that celebrity. Typically amongst Canadian icons, Fox is an unconventional hero, admired but not without flaws. An obituary in the &quot;Canadian Family Physician&quot; emphasized his humanity and noted that his anger – at his diagnosis, at press misrepresentations and at those he saw as encroaching on his independence – spoke against ascribing sainthood for Fox, and thus placed his achievements within the reach of all.

===Views on Fox&#x27;s disability===
Fox refused to regard himself as disabled, and would not allow anyone to pity him, telling a Toronto radio station that he found life more &quot;rewarding and challenging&quot; since he had lost his leg. His feat helped redefine Canadian views of disability and the inclusion of disabled people in society. Fox&#x27;s actions increased the visibility of people with disabilities, and influenced the attitudes of those with disabilities by showing disability portrayed in a positive light. Rick Hansen commented that the run challenged society to focus on ability rather than disability, writing, &quot;What was perceived as a limitation became a great opportunity. People with disabilities started looking at things differently. They came away with huge pride&quot;.

The narrative surrounding Fox has been critiqued as illustrating the media&#x27;s focus on stereotyped portrayals of the heroic and extraordinary achievements of people with disabilities, rather than more mundane accomplishments. Actor Alan Toy noted &quot;Sure, it raised money for cancer research and sure it showed the human capacity for achievement. But a lot of disabled people are made to feel like failures if they haven&#x27;t done something extraordinary. They may be bankers or factory workers – proof enough of their usefulness to society. Do we have to be &#x27;supercrips&#x27; in order to be valid? And if we&#x27;re not super, are we invalid?&quot; The media&#x27;s idealization of Fox has also been critiqued for emphasizing an individualistic approach to illness and disability, in which the body is a machine to be mastered, rather than the social model of disability where societal attitudes and barriers to inclusion play a prominent role in determining who is disabled.

===Terry Fox Run===

During Fox&#x27;s marathon, Sharp proposed an annual fundraising run in Fox&#x27;s name; Fox agreed, but insisted that the runs be non-competitive and include any who wanted to participate. Sharp faced opposition to the project: the Cancer Society feared that a fall run would detract from its traditional April campaigns, while other charities believed that an additional fundraiser would leave less money for their causes. Sharp persisted, and he, the Four Seasons Hotels and the Fox family organized the first Terry Fox Run on September 13, 1981.

Over 300,000 people took part and raised $3.5 million in the first Terry Fox Run. Schools across Canada were urged to join the second run, held on September 19, 1982. School participation has continued since, evolving into the National School Run Day. The runs, which raised over $20 million in their first six years, grew into an international event as over one million people in 60 countries took part in 1999, raising $15 million that year alone. By the Terry Fox Run&#x27;s 25th anniversary, more than three million people were taking part annually. Grants from the Terry Fox Foundation, which organizes the runs, have helped Canadian scientists make numerous advances in cancer research. The Terry Fox Run is the world&#x27;s largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research, and over $850 million has been raised in his name .

===Honours===

The physical memorials in Canada named after Fox include:
* Approximately 32 roads and streets, notably Terry Fox Drive, Ottawa, and the Terry Fox Courage Highway near Thunder Bay, near where Fox ended his run and where a statue of him was erected as a monument the Terry Fox Memorial and Lookout;
* 14 schools, including a new school in a suburb of Montreal that was renamed Terry Fox Elementary School shortly after he died, and the Port Coquitlam high school from which he had graduated, which was renamed Terry Fox Secondary School on January 18, 1986;
* 14 other buildings, including many athletic centres, and 
**Terry Fox Stadium, Ottawa, Ontario
**Terry Fox Station, a transitway stop in Ottawa
**Terry Fox Theatre, Port Coquitlam, British Columbia
**the Terry Fox Research Institute and the Terry Fox Laboratory, the major research unit of the British Columbia Cancer Agency;
* Seven statues, including:
**the Terry Fox Monument in Ottawa, which was the genesis of &quot;The Path of Heroes&quot;, a federal government initiative that seeks to honour the people that shaped the nation;
**In 2011, a series of four bronze sculptures of Fox, designed by Douglas Coupland and depicting Fox running toward the Pacific Ocean, was unveiled at Terry Fox Plaza outside BC Place in downtown Vancouver. 
* Nine fitness trails;
* A previously unnamed mountain in the Canadian Rockies in the Selwyn range, which was named Mount Terry Fox by the government of British Columbia; the area around it is now known as Mount Terry Fox Provincial Park;
* The Terry Fox Fountain of Hope was installed in 1982 on the grounds of Rideau Hall;
* The Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker CCGS &quot;Terry Fox&quot;, which was commissioned in 1983.

Shortly after his death, Fox was named the Newsmaker of the Year for 1981, and Canada Post announced the production of a commemorative stamp in 1981, bypassing its traditionally held position that stamps honouring people should not be created until ten years after their deaths. British rock star Rod Stewart was so moved by the Marathon of Hope that he was inspired to write and dedicate the song &quot;Never Give Up on a Dream&quot; – found on his 1981 album &quot;Tonight I&#x27;m Yours&quot; – to Fox. Stewart also called his 1981–1982 tour of Canada the &quot;Terry Fox Tour&quot;. In 1982 the groundwork was laid for the Terry Fox Canadian Youth Centre, a residential hostel in Ottawa for high school students to come from across Canada to spend a week learning about the country. It was set up by the Canadian Unity Council; the programme later became known as Encounters with Canada and the building was renamed the Historica Canada Centre.

In 2012, Fox was posthumously inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame in the Builder category in recognition of his public service in the name of research fundraising.

The Terry Fox Hall of Fame was established in 1994 to recognize individuals that have made contributions that improved the quality of life of disabled people. The Terry Fox Laboratory research centre was established in Vancouver to conduct leading edge research into the causes and potential cures for cancer.

In 2005, the Royal Canadian Mint issued a special dollar coin designed by Stanley Witten to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Marathon of Hope. It was their first regular circulation coin to feature a Canadian.

In 2008, Fox was named a National Historic Person of Canada, a recognition given by the Canadian government to those persons who are considered to have played a nationally significant role in the history of the country. Fox&#x27;s designation was due to his status as an &quot;enduring icon&quot;, his personal qualities, and for the manner in which the Marathon of Hope had captivated the country and resonated deeply with Canadians.

Fox&#x27;s mother, Betty Fox, was one of eight people to carry the Olympic Flag into BC Place Stadium at the opening ceremonies of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. The games saw the Terry Fox Award bestowed on Olympic athletes who embodied Fox&#x27;s characteristics of determination and humility in the face of adversity.

Beginning in 2015, Manitoba designated the first Monday in August, formerly known as Civic Holiday, as Terry Fox Day.

On September 13, 2020, Google celebrated Fox with a Google Doodle.

===Film and stage===
Fox&#x27;s story was dramatized in the 1983 biographical film &quot;The Terry Fox Story&quot;. Produced by Home Box Office, the film aired as a television movie in the United States and had a theatrical run in Canada. The film starred amputee actor Eric Fryer and Robert Duvall, and was the first film made exclusively for pay television. The movie received mixed but generally positive reviews, but was criticized by Fox&#x27;s family over how it portrayed his temper. &quot;The Terry Fox Story&quot; was nominated for eight Genie Awards, and won five, including Best Picture and Best Actor.

Rock musician Ian Thomas had written and recorded a song in response to Fox&#x27;s story, &quot;Runner&quot;, which ended up being included in the film. It also was covered by Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band, reaching 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1984.

A second movie, titled &quot;Terry&quot;, focused on the Marathon of Hope, was produced by the CTV Television Network in 2005. Fox was portrayed by Shawn Ashmore. He is not an amputee; digital editing was used to superimpose a prosthesis over his real leg. The film was endorsed by Fox&#x27;s family, and portrayed his attitude more positively than the first movie. Canadian National Basketball Association star Steve Nash, who himself was inspired by Fox when he was a child, directed a 2010 documentary &quot;Into the Wind&quot;, which aired on ESPN as part of its &quot;30 for 30&quot; series.

Fox&#x27;s story was brought to the stage in 2016 in &quot;Marathon of Hope: The Musical&quot; produced by Drayton Entertainment.

===Steve Fonyo and Rick Hansen===
Fox was not the first person to attempt to run across Canada. Mark Kent crossed the country in 1974 as he raised money for the Canadian team at the 1976 Summer Olympics. While he lived, Fox refused to let anyone else complete the Marathon of Hope, having promised to finish it himself once he recovered. Steve Fonyo, an 18-year-old with the same form of cancer and who also had a leg amputated, sought in 1984 to duplicate Fox&#x27;s run, calling his effort the &quot;Journey for Lives&quot;. After leaving St. John&#x27;s on March 31, Fonyo reached the point where Fox was forced to end his marathon at the end of November, and completed the transcontinental run on May 29, 1985. The Journey for Lives raised over $13 million for cancer research.

Canadian Paralympic athlete Rick Hansen, who had recruited Fox to play on his wheelchair basketball team in 1977, was similarly inspired by the Marathon of Hope. Hansen, who first considered circumnavigating the globe in his wheelchair in 1974, began the Man in Motion World Tour in 1985 with the goal of raising $10 million towards research into spinal cord injuries. As Fonyo had, Hansen paused at the spot Fox&#x27;s run ended to honour the late runner. Hansen completed his world tour in May 1987 after 792 days and ; he travelled through 34 countries and raised over $26 million.

===Government documents===
Fox is shown in the 2013 rendering of the Canadian passport. In December 2024, Fox was chosen to appear on a future issue of the Canadian $5 bill.

<text>In cricket, an umpire (from the Old French meaning not a peer, i.e. not a member of one of the teams, impartial) is a person who has the authority to make decisions about events on the cricket field according to the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot;. Besides making decisions about legality of delivery, appeals for wickets and general conduct of the Game in a legal manner, the umpire also keeps a record of the deliveries and announces the completion of an over.

The umpires in cricket are not to be confused with the referee who usually presides only over international matches and makes no decisions affecting the outcome of the game.

== Overview ==
Traditionally, cricket matches have two umpires on the field, one standing at the end where the bowler delivers the ball (bowler&#x27;s end), and one directly opposite the facing batsman (usually, but not always, at square leg). However, in the modern game, there may be more than two umpires; for example Test Matches have four: two on-field umpires, a third umpire who has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire who looks after the match balls and takes out the drinks for the on-field umpires.

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has three panels of umpires: namely the Elite Panel of Umpires, the larger International Panel of Umpires and the Development Panel of ICC Umpires. Most Test matches are controlled by neutral members of the Elite Panel, with local members of the International Panel providing, usually in the third or fourth umpire roles. Members of the International Panel will occasionally officiate as neutral on-field umpires in Tests. Members of the three panels officiate in One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) matches.

Professional matches also have a match referee, who complements the role of the umpires. The match referee makes no decisions relevant to the outcome of the game, but instead enforces the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct, ensuring the game is played in a reputable manner. The ICC appoints a match referee from its Elite Panel of Referees to adjudicate Test matches and ODIs.

Minor cricket matches will often have trained umpires. The independent Association of Cricket Umpires and Scorers (ACU&amp;S), formed in 1955, used to conduct umpire training within the UK. It however merged to form the ECB Association of Cricket Officials (ECB ACO) on 1 January 2008. A new structure of cricket umpiring and scoring qualifications has now been put into place and the ACO provides training and examinations for these. Cricket Australia has introduced a two-tier accreditation scheme and eventually all umpires will be required to achieve the appropriate level of accreditation. The ages of umpires can vary enormously as some are former players, while others enter the cricketing world as umpires.

In accordance with the tradition of cricket, most ordinary, local games will have two umpires, one supplied by each side, who will fairly enforce the accepted rules.

== Positions ==
When a ball is being bowled, one umpire (the &quot;bowler&#x27;s end umpire&quot;) stands behind the stumps at the non-striker&#x27;s end (that is, the end from which the ball is being bowled), which gives them a view straight down the pitch.

The second (the &quot;striker&#x27;s end umpire&quot;) takes the position that they feel gives them the best view of the play. Through long tradition, this is usually square leg – in line with the popping crease and a few yards to the batsman&#x27;s leg side – hence they are sometimes known as the &quot;square leg umpire&quot;.

However, if a fielder takes up position at &quot;square leg&quot; or somewhere so as to block their view, or if there is an injured batsman with a runner, then the umpire must move somewhere else – typically either a short distance or to &quot;point&quot; on the opposite side of the batsman. If the square-leg umpire elects to stand at point, they are required to inform both the batsmen, the captain of the fielding team, and their colleague. They may also move to the point position later in the afternoon if the setting sun prevents a clear view of the popping crease at their end.

It is up to the umpires to keep out of the way of both the ball and the players. In particular, if the ball is hit and the players attempt a run, then the umpire behind the stumps will generally retreat to the side, in case the fielding side attempts a &quot;run out&quot; at that end.

At the end of each over, the two umpires will exchange roles. Because the bowler&#x27;s end alternates between overs, this means they only move a short distance.

== Decisions and signals ==

During play, the umpire at the bowler&#x27;s end makes the decisions, which they mainly indicate using arm signals. Some decisions must be instantaneous, whereas for others they may pause to think or discuss it with the square leg umpire, especially if the latter may have had a better view.

===At the end of an over===

The umpire keeps a record of the deliveries and announces the completion of an over. Occasionally an umpire may miscount, leading to one too many or too few balls being bowled in the over, however in most grades the scorers may communicate with the umpires to determine the correct count.

=== When the ball is in play ===
These decisions have an important effect on the play and are signalled straight away.

==== Out ====
An umpire will not give a batsman out unless an appeal is made by the fielding side, though a batsman may walk if they know themself to be out. This is nowadays rare, especially in Tests and first-class matches for contentious decisions; however, it is the norm for a batsman to walk when they are bowled or obviously caught. If the fielding side believes a batsman is out, the fielding side must appeal, by asking the umpire to provide a ruling.

The umpire&#x27;s response is either to raise their index finger above their head to indicate that the batsman is out, or to clearly say &quot;not out&quot;, which is usually accompanied with a shake of the head. The &#x27;out&#x27; signal is the only signal that, if indicated by the striker&#x27;s end umpire, does not require confirmation by the bowler&#x27;s end umpire.

==== No-ball ====
Either umpire may call, and signal, no-ball, for an illegal delivery, although each umpire has unique jurisdictions. The most usual causes for no-balls are foot faults or a ball passing above a batsman&#x27;s waist without bouncing, each of these being under the jurisdiction of the umpire at the bowler&#x27;s end. The square-leg umpire will rarely have to call a no-ball, as their jurisdiction is limited to infringements that occur less frequently such as short pitched deliveries which pass the batting crease above the batsman&#x27;s shoulders. The signal is to hold one arm out horizontally and shout &quot;no-ball&quot;; the idea being that the batsman is aware of the no-ball being bowled. In matches under the auspices of the ICC, it may also be a no-ball if the umpire feels that the bowler&#x27;s arm is bent more than 15 degrees (throwing rather than bowling). The ICC have chosen to amend Law 21.2 (Fair Delivery – the arm) as a result of controversy concerning the legality or otherwise of bowling actions of certain prominent bowlers.

In certain forms of limited overs cricket, such as T20s and ODIs, a no-ball that is the result of the bowler overstepping the crease or bowling above a batsman&#x27;s waist will be penalised by the next delivery being a free hit. The umpire will signal this by circling a finger horizontally over their head, usually following a no-ball signal (and any other signals associated with the no-ball such as a boundary). During a free hit delivery, batters cannot be dismissed caught, bowled, leg before wicket or stumped.

==== Wide ====
A wide is an illegal delivery, due to it being &quot;wide of where the striker is standing or has stood at any point after the ball came into play for that delivery, and which also would have passed wide of the striker standing in a normal batting position.&quot; (Law 22).
A wide is signalled by extending both arms out horizontally and is accompanied by a call of Wide Ball.
If a delivery satisfies the criteria for both a No Ball and a Wide, the call and penalty of No Ball takes precedence.
Umpires are not to signal a wide until the ball has passed the batsman. If a batsman chooses to pursue a wide delivery, once contact with the bat takes place it cannot be called wide.

==== Dead ball ====

If the ball is no longer considered in play it is a dead ball. An umpire will signal this by crossing and uncrossing their wrists below their waist with the call Dead Ball, if they are required to do so under certain Laws, and also may do it if they think it is necessary to inform the players.

A similar signal is also used to indicate a &quot;not out&quot; from the Decision Review System. This is signalled by an umpire crossing their hands in a horizontal position in front and above their waist three times.

=== Signals to scorers ===
It is important that the scorers note down the play accurately and therefore the appropriate signals will be made by the umpire when the ball is dead (see Law 2.13). In addition to the following, the umpire repeats signals of dead ball, wide, and no-ball to the scorers. Scorers are required to acknowledge the signals from umpires; and umpires are required to get an acknowledgement before allowing the match to proceed.

==== Four ====

If a batsman scores four when they hit the ball across the boundary (not by actually running them), the umpire signals this by waving their arm back and forth in front of the chest. This signal varies a lot between umpires, from two short, restrained, waves finishing with the arm across the chest, to elaborate signals that resemble those of a conductor of an orchestra.
Whichever way the umpire signals a four they must, by law, finish with their arm across the chest (so as to avoid confusion about whether a No Ball was delivered as well).

==== Six ====
A six scored by hitting the ball over the boundary is signalled by the umpire raising both hands above their head.
For a six to be scored, the ball must come off the bat, so it is impossible to have six byes for a ball crossing the boundary (without there being overthrows).

==== Bye ====

If runs are to be scored as byes, the umpire will hold up one open palm above the head.

==== Leg bye ====
Leg byes are signalled by the umpire touching a raised knee.

==== Short run ====
If one of the batsmen turns to complete runs after the first without grounding their person or equipment behind the popping crease, then a &quot;short run&quot; is signalled by the umpire tapping their near shoulder with their fingers and the short runs are not scored. If more than one run is short, the umpire will inform the scorers as to the number of runs scored.
There is also a case of deliberate short running, where the umpire will disallow all runs, although this is a rather rare occurrence.

====Decision Review System====

If the umpire is unsure of a &quot;line decision&quot; (that is, a run out or stumped decision) or if the umpire is unsure whether the ball is a four, a six, or neither, they may refer the matter to the Third Umpire. The umpires may additionally refer decisions to the Third Umpire regarding Bump Balls and catches being taken cleanly (but only after the on-field umpires have consulted and both were unsighted). Additionally the players may decide to refer a dismissal decision to the Third Umpire. The on-field umpire signals a referral using both hands to mime a TV screen by making a box shape.

If the Third Umpire decides that the on-field umpire made an incorrect decision then they will inform the on-field umpire, via headsets, of what they have seen and tell them to either change their decision or to stay with their original decision. The on-field umpire may then have to signal the &#x27;revoke last signal&#x27; sign (below).

The Third Umpire is not used except in international or important domestic matches.

==== Penalty runs ====

For extreme misconduct by one team, the umpire may award five penalty runs to the other team. Placing one arm on the opposite shoulder indicates that the penalty runs are awarded to the fielding team, but if the umpire taps that shoulder, the penalties are awarded to the batting team.

Five penalty runs are more commonly awarded when the ball strikes a foreign object on the field, usually a helmet of the fielding side.

==== Last hour ====
In Test cricket and first-class cricket, the last hour of the last day of play has special significance. First, there is a minimum number of overs (20 in the Laws of Cricket, fifteen in Tests) that must be bowled in the last hour. Second, and more importantly, a result must be reached before the time elapses and the umpire calls &quot;stumps&quot; for the match to have a winner; otherwise, the match ends with a draw and no winner. The umpire signals the last hour by pointing to their wrist (and the watch on it), which is raised above their head.

==== Revoke last signal ====
If the umpire makes an incorrect signal, they may revoke it. To do so, they cross their arms across their chest, then makes the corrected signal. A revocation may be made if the umpire discovers an incorrect application of the laws, such as, signalling &quot;out&quot; before realising that the other umpire signalled a no-ball. Also, an umpire may revoke if they accidentally signal a four though they intended to signal six.
With the implementation of the Decision Review System, a signal may also be revoked if the Third Umpire reports that their review supports reversing the call.

====New Ball====
In matches lasting more than two days the captain usually has the option of taking another new ball after a set number of overs (usually 80) have taken place since a new ball was introduced (an innings always begins with a new ball). The umpire at the bowler&#x27;s end signals to the scorers that a new ball has been taken by holding the ball above their head. The scorers note the time that the new ball has been taken.

If the ball is damaged to the extent that it gives either team a disadvantage, it is replaced with a used undamaged ball in similar condition. A similar-condition used ball is also used if the ball is ever lost in the course of play (for example, if a ball hit for six becomes irretrievable).

In 2007 the International Cricket Council (ICC) brought in a new law stipulating that, in ODIs, after 35 overs have been bowled the ball must be replaced with a clean used ball. In 2011 this rule was changed so that a different ball is used at each end, thus each ball getting used for 25 overs. The balls used in ODIs are white and become discoloured very easily, especially on dusty or abrasive pitches, and thus the ball change is deemed necessary to ensure that the ball is easily visible.

====Power Play====
ICC introduced a system of Powerplays in limited-over cricket which restricts the number of fielders outside the 30-yard circle, among other things. When a Powerplay is beginning, the umpire moves their hand in circular fashion above their head.
* In ODI, the entire innings is played through three different Powerplays with looser restrictions as the innings progresses. The first Powerplay lasts for the first ten overs and restricts the fielding team to two fielders outside the 30-yard circle. The second Powerplay comprises the middle 30 overs (the 11th through 40th overs) and raises the limit to four fielders outside the circle. The third and final Powerplay lasts for the final ten overs (the 41st through 50th overs) and allows five fielders outside the circle.
* In Twenty20, a Powerplay is in effect for the first six overs of an innings, whereby only two fielders can be outside the fielding circle. For the rest of the innings, five fielders can be placed outside the circle.

== Etymology ==
The predecessor of &quot;umpire&quot; came from the Old French &quot;nonper&quot; (from &quot;non&quot;, &quot;not&quot; and &quot;per&quot;, &quot;equal&quot;), meaning &quot;one who is requested to act as arbiter of a dispute between two people&quot;, or that the arbiter is not paired with anyone in the dispute.

In Middle English, the earliest form of this shows up as &quot;noumper&quot; around 1350, and the earliest version without the &quot;n&quot; shows up as &quot;owmpere&quot;, a variant spelling in Middle English, circa 1440. The &quot;n&quot; was lost after it was written (in 1426–1427) as &quot;a noounpier&quot; with the &quot;a&quot; being the indefinite article. The leading &quot;n&quot; became attached to the article, changing it to &quot;an oumper&quot; around 1475; this sort of linguistic shift is called false splitting. Thus today one says &quot;an umpire&quot; instead of &quot;a numpire&quot;.

The word was applied to the officials of many sports, including association football (where it has been superseded by &quot;referee&quot;) and baseball (which still uses it).

<text>The Clarendon Building is an early 18th-century neoclassical building of the University of Oxford. It is in Broad Street, Oxford, England, next to the Bodleian Library and the Sheldonian Theatre and near the centre of the city. It was built between 1711 and 1715 and is now a Grade I listed building.

==History==
Until the early 18th century, the printing presses of the Oxford University Press (OUP) were in the basement of the Sheldonian Theatre. This meant that the compositors could not work when the Theatre was in use for ceremonies. Therefore, the University commissioned a new building to house the OUP.

Nicholas Hawksmoor produced a neoclassical design, construction started in 1711 and it was completed in 1715. The builder and sculptor was William Townesend of Oxford.

The building was funded largely from the proceeds of the commercially successful &quot;History of the Great Rebellion&quot; by the 1st Earl of Clarendon, whose legacy later paid for the building of the Clarendon Laboratory in Oxford as well.

In the 1820s, the OUP moved to new premises in Walton Street, after which the University used the Clarendon Building for administrative purposes. In 1975, the building was transferred to the Bodleian Library, for which it now provides office and meeting space for senior members of staff.

===Student occupation===
On 22 January 2009, student demonstrators occupied part of the Clarendon Building for seven hours, following similar protests at other UK universities. The demonstrators called for the University to condemn Israel&#x27;s role in the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict and to cancel a lecture series at Balliol College inaugurated by Shimon Peres. The protestors ended their protest after an agreement with the Senior Proctor.

<text>Nicholas Hawksmoor ( – 25 March 1736) was an English architect. He was a leading figure of the English Baroque style of architecture in the late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth centuries. Hawksmoor worked alongside the principal architects of the time, Christopher Wren and John Vanbrugh, and contributed to the design of some of the most notable buildings of the period, including St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Wren&#x27;s City of London churches, Greenwich Hospital, Blenheim Palace and Castle Howard. Part of his work has been correctly attributed to him only relatively recently, and his influence has reached several poets and authors of the twentieth century.

==Life==

Hawksmoor was born in Nottinghamshire in 1661, into a yeoman farming family, almost certainly in East Drayton or Ragnall, Nottinghamshire. On his death he was to leave property at nearby Ragnall, Dunham and a house and land at Great Drayton. It is not known where he received his schooling, but it was probably in more than basic literacy. George Vertue, whose family had property in Hawksmoor&#x27;s part of Nottinghamshire, wrote in 1731 that he was taken as a youth to act as clerk by &quot;Justice Mellust in Yorkshire, where Mr Gouge senior did some fretwork ceilings afterwards Mr. Haukesmore came to London, became clerk to Sr. Christopher Wren &amp; thence became an Architect&quot;.

=== Apprenticeship ===
Christopher Wren, hearing of his &quot;early skill and genius&quot; for architecture, took him on as his clerk at about the age of 18. A surviving early sketch-book contains sketches and notes, some dated 1680 and 1683, of buildings in Nottingham, Coventry, Warwick, Bath, Bristol, Oxford and Northampton. These somewhat amateur drawings, now in the Royal Institute of British Architects Drawings Collection, show that he was still learning the techniques of his new profession at the age of 22. His first official post was as Deputy Surveyor to Wren at Winchester Palace from 1683 until February 1685. Hawksmoor&#x27;s signature appears on a brickmaker&#x27;s contract for Winchester Palace in November 1684. Wren was paying him 2 shillings a day in 1685 as assistant in his office in Whitehall.

From about 1684 to about 1700, Hawksmoor worked with Wren on projects including Chelsea Hospital, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Hampton Court Palace and Greenwich Hospital. Thanks to Wren&#x27;s influence as Surveyor-General, Hawksmoor was named Clerk of the Works at Kensington Palace (1689) and Deputy Surveyor of Works at Greenwich (1705). In 1718, when Wren was superseded by the new, amateur Surveyor, William Benson, Hawksmoor was deprived of his double post to provide places for Benson&#x27;s brother. &quot;Poor Hawksmoor,&quot; wrote Vanbrugh in 1721. &quot;What a Barbarous Age have his fine, ingenious Parts fallen into. What wou&#x27;d Monsr: Colbert in France have given for such a man?&quot; Only in 1726 after Benson&#x27;s successor Thomas Hewet died, was Hawksmoor restored to the secretaryship, though not the clerkship which was given to Henry Flitcroft. In 1696, Hawksmoor was appointed surveyor to the Westminster and Middlesex Commission of Sewers, but was dismissed in 1700, having neglected to attend the Court several days last past.

==== Maturity ====
In 1702, Hawksmoor designed the baroque country house of Easton Neston in Northamptonshire for Sir William Fermor. This was the only country house for which he was the sole architect, though he extensively remodelled Ockham House, now mostly destroyed, for the Lord Chancellor Peter King, 1st Baron King. Easton Neston was not completed as he intended, the symmetrical flanking wings and entrance colonnade remaining unexecuted.

He then worked for a time with Sir John Vanbrugh, assisting him on the building Blenheim Palace for John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, where he took charge from 1705, after Vanbrugh&#x27;s final break with the demanding Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, and Castle Howard for Charles Howard, later the 3rd Earl of Carlisle. In July 1721, John Vanbrugh made Hawksmoor his deputy as Comptroller of the Works. There is no doubt that Hawksmoor brought to the brilliant amateur the professional grounding he had received from Wren, but it is also arguable that Wren&#x27;s architectural development was from the persuasion of his formal pupil, Hawksmoor.

By 1700 Hawksmoor had emerged as a major architectural personality, and in the next 20 years he proved himself to be one of the great masters of the English Baroque. His baroque, but somewhat classical and gothic architectural form was derived from his exploration of antiquity, the Renaissance, the English Middle Ages and contemporary Italian baroque. Unlike many of his wealthier contemporaries, Hawksmoor never travelled to Italy on a Grand Tour, where he might have been influenced by the style of architecture there. Instead he studied engravings especially monuments of ancient Rome and reconstructions of the Temple of Solomon.

=== Work at Oxford and Cambridge ===
As he neared the age of 50, Hawksmoor began to produce work for the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. In 1713 he was commissioned to complete King&#x27;s College, Cambridge: the scheme consisted of a Fellows&#x27; Building along King&#x27;s Parade, and opposite the Chapel a monumental range of buildings containing the Great Hall, kitchens and to the south of that the library and Provost&#x27;s Lodge. Plans and wooden models for the scheme survive, but it proved too expensive and Hawksmoor produced a second scaled down design. But the college that had invested heavily in the South Sea Company lost their money when the &quot;bubble&quot; burst in 1720. As a result, Hawksmoor&#x27;s scheme was never executed; instead, the college was developed later in the 18th century by James Gibbs and early in the 19th century by William Wilkins. In the 1690s, Hawksmoor gave proposals for the library of The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. However like many of his proposals for both universities, such as All Souls College, Oxford, the Radcliffe Library, Brasenose College, Oxford, Magdalen College, Oxford, the library was not executed.

Hawksmoor conceived grand rebuilding schemes for central Oxford, most of which were not realised. Surviving drawings from c.1713 propose the rebuilding of the central core of the academic area of Oxford as a &quot;Forum Universitatis&quot;. The concept for a domed circular library sitting within an open square for the Radcliffe Camera was initially Hawksmoor&#x27;s, but the commission for the building eventually went to James Gibbs, due to Hawksmoor&#x27;s untimely death. He designed the Clarendon Building at Oxford; the Codrington Library and new buildings at All Souls College, Oxford; parts of Worcester College, Oxford with Sir George Clarke; the High Street screen at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford and six new churches in London. Hawksmoor was initiated into freemasonry in 1730 at the Oxford Arms in Ludgate Street, City of London, a lodge belonging to the Premier Grand Lodge of England.

==Hawksmoor&#x27;s six London Churches==


In 1711, parliament passed an &quot;Act for the building of Fifty New Churches in the Cities of London and Westminster or the Suburbs thereof&quot;, which established a commission which included Christopher Wren, John Vanbrugh, Thomas Archer and a number of churchmen. The commission appointed Hawksmoor and William Dickinson as its surveyors. As supervising architects they were not necessarily expected to design all the churches themselves. Dickinson left his post in 1713 and was replaced by James Gibbs. Gibbs was removed in 1716 and replaced by John James. James and Hawksmoor remained in office until the commission was wound up in 1733. The declining enthusiasm of the Commission, and the expense of the buildings, meant that only twelve churches were completed, six designed by Hawksmoor, and two by James in collaboration with Hawksmoor. The two collaborations were St Luke Old Street (1727–33) and St John Horsleydown (1727–33), to which Hawksmoor&#x27;s contribution seems to have been largely confined to the towers with their extraordinary steeples.

The six churches wholly designed by Hawksmoor were St Alfege Church, Greenwich; St George&#x27;s, Bloomsbury; Christ Church, Spitalfields; St George in the East, Wapping; St Mary Woolnoth; and St Anne&#x27;s Limehouse. They are his best-known independent works of architecture, and compare in their complexity of interpenetrating internal spaces with contemporaneous work in Italy by Francesco Borromini. Their spires are essentially Gothic outlines executed in innovative and imaginative Classical detail. Although Hawksmoor and John James terminated the commission by 1733, they were still being paid &quot;for carrying on and finishing the works under their care&quot; until James&#x27;s death.

After the death of Wren in 1723, Hawksmoor was appointed Surveyor of the Fabric of Westminster Abbey. Parliament had voted £100 for the repair and completion of the Abbey in 1698. The west towers of the Abbey were designed by Hawksmoor but not completed until after his death.

===Gallery of churches===
==Garden buildings and monuments==
Hawksmoor also designed a number of structures for the gardens at Castle Howard. These are:
*The Pyramid (1728)
*The Mausoleum (1729–40) built on the same scale as his London churches, it is almost certainly the first free-standing mausoleum built in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire.
*The Carrmire Gate (1727)
*The Temple of Venus (1731–35) demolished
At Blenheim Palace he designed the Woodstock Gate (1723) in the form of a Triumphal arch.
He also designed the Ripon Obelisk in Ripon&#x27;s market place, erected in 1702, at in height it was the first large scale obelisk to be erected in Britain.
==Death and obituary==
Hawksmoor died on 25 March 1736 in his house at Millbank from &quot;Gout of the stomach&quot;. He had suffered poor health for the last twenty years of his life and was often confined to bed hardly able to sign his name. His will instructed that he be buried at the church of St Botolph Shenley, Hertfordshire, Shenleybury, which has been deconsecrated so the tomb now sits in a private garden. The inscription, cut by Andrews Jelfe a mason who worked regularly on his buildings reads:

Hawksmoor&#x27;s only child was a daughter, Elizabeth, whose second husband, Nathanial Blackerby, wrote the obituary of his father-in-law.

His obituary appeared in &quot;Read&#x27;s Weekly Journal&quot;, no. 603. 27 March 1736:

Upon his death he left a widow, to whom he bequeathed all his property in Westminster, Highgate, Shenley, and East Drayton, who later married William Theaker; the grandchild of this second marriage ultimately inherited Hawksmoor&#x27;s properties near Drayton after the death of the architect&#x27;s widow.

==Hawksmoor in modern literature==
Hawksmoor&#x27;s architecture has influenced several poets and authors of the twentieth century. His church St Mary Woolnoth is mentioned in T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (1922).

Algernon Stitch lived in a &quot;superb creation by Nicholas Hawksmoor&quot; in London in the novel &quot;Scoop&quot; by Evelyn Waugh (1938).

Hawksmoor is the subject of a poem by Iain Sinclair called &#x27;Nicholas Hawksmoor: His Churches&#x27; which appeared in Sinclair&#x27;s collection of poems &quot;Lud Heat&quot; (1975). Sinclair promoted the poetic interpretation of the architect&#x27;s singular style of architectural composition that Hawksmoor&#x27;s churches formed a pattern consistent with the forms of Theistic Satanism though there is no documentary or historic evidence for this. This idea was, however, embellished by Peter Ackroyd in his novel &quot;Hawksmoor&quot; (1985): the historical Hawksmoor is refigured as the fictional Devil-worshipper Nicholas Dyer, while the eponymous Hawksmoor is a twentieth-century detective charged with investigating a series of murders perpetrated on Dyer&#x27;s (Hawksmoor&#x27;s) churches.

Both Sinclair and Ackroyd&#x27;s ideas in turn were further developed by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell in their graphic novel, &quot;From Hell&quot;, which speculated that Jack the Ripper used Hawksmoor&#x27;s buildings as part of ritual magic, with his victims as human sacrifice. In the appendix, Moore revealed that he had met and spoken with Sinclair on numerous occasions while developing the core ideas of the book. The argument includes the idea that the locations of the churches form a pentagram with ritual significance.

<text>The Radcliffe Camera (colloquially known as the &quot;Rad Cam&quot; or &quot;The Camera&quot;; from Latin , meaning &#x27;room&#x27;) is a building of the University of Oxford, England, designed by James Gibbs in a Baroque style and built in 1737–49 to house the Radcliffe Science Library. It is sited to the south of the Old Bodleian, north of the Church of St Mary the Virgin, and between Brasenose College to the west and All Souls College to the east. The Radcliffe Camera&#x27;s circularity, its position in the heart of Oxford, and its separation from other buildings make it the focal point of the University of Oxford, and as such it is almost always included in shorthand visual representations of the university. The Radcliffe Camera is not open to the public.

The library&#x27;s construction and maintenance was funded from the estate of John Radcliffe, a physician who left £40,000 upon his death in 1714. According to the terms of his will, construction only began in 1737, although the intervening period saw the complex purchase of the site. The exterior was complete in 1747 and the interior finished by 1748, although the library&#x27;s opening was delayed until 13 April 1749.

Upon its completion, Francis Wise was appointed as its first librarian. Until 1810, the library housed books covering a wide range of subjects, but under George Williams it narrowed its focus to the sciences. Williams brought the library from a state of neglect up to date, although by 1850 the Radcliffe Library still lagged behind the Bodleian. It was at this point that Henry Wentworth Acland, then librarian, laid out plans for the Radcliffe Library building to merge with the university and the library&#x27;s collection of books to be moved to the newly constructed Radcliffe Science Library, which were accepted by the library&#x27;s trustees and the university. It was at this point that the building became known as the Radcliffe Camera, serving as a reading room for the Bodleian.

==History==

===Background===
John Radcliffe (c.1650–1714) attended University College from the age of thirteen, becoming a fellow of Lincoln College at eighteen. In a successful medical career, his patients included William III and Queen Anne. He built up a large fortune and died childless. He is buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Oxford.

It was known that he intended to build a library in Oxford at least two years before his death in 1714. It was thought that the new building would be an extension westwards of the Selden End of the Bodleian Library. Francis Atterbury, Dean of Christ Church, writing in December 1712 describes plans for a 90 ft room on the site of neighbouring Exeter College, and that the lower storey would be a library for Exeter College and the upper story Radcliffe&#x27;s Library.

Radcliffe dedicated £100 a year to furnishing his proposed library with books. Plans were prepared by Nicholas Hawksmoor and are now held in the Ashmolean Museum. By 1714, however, Radcliffe had settled on a different site for his new library, to the south of the existing Bodleian. William Pittis, Radcliffe&#x27;s first biographer, ascribes the change of heart to excessive demands from the Rector and Fellows of Exeter College.

===Plans===
Radcliffe died on 1 November 1714. His will, proved on 8 December, provided for the building of a new library on the new site, stating:
And will that my executors pay forty thousand pounds in the terme of ten years, by yearly payments of four thousand pounds, the first payment thereof to begin and be made after the decease of my said two sisters for the building a library in Oxford and the purchaseing the houses between St Maries and the scholes in Catstreet where I intend the Library to be built, and when the said Library is built I give one hundred and fifty pounds per annum for ever to the Library Keeper thereof for the time being and one hundred pounds a year per annum for ever for buying books for the same Library.
It also provided £100 a year to maintain the new library, but only once 30 years had elapsed from his death. The library-keeper was to be chosen by several influential figures: the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor, the Chancellor of the University of Oxford, the Bishop of London and the Bishop of Winchester, the Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary, the Lord Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench and the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and the Master of the Rolls. The first payment was to be made after the death of Radcliffe&#x27;s two sisters, Hannah Redshaw and Millicent Radcliffe. The latter lived until 1736, although it appears between the death of Redshaw in 1716 and Millicent Radcliffe in 1736, much preparatory work was done acquiring the site for the library.
A number of tenement houses fronting Catte Street, built right up to the schools, some gardens, Brasenose College outbuildings and Black Hall occupied the site required for the library. A number of colleges became involved in the development of the site. An added problem was that Brasenose required an equal amount of land fronting High Street in return for the land they were being asked to give up. As a consequence, the trustees had to negotiate with the owners and the tenants of the houses. An act of Parliament, the (7 Geo. 1. St. 1. c. &quot;13&quot;), was passed that enabled any corporations within the university to sell ground for building a library. The negotiations dealing with Catte Street took over twenty years, with the final payments being made to Oriel, Magdalen and University colleges in 1737 (N.S.).

Radcliffe had placed four men in charge of his estate: William Bromley, sometime Speaker of the House of Commons; Sir George Beaumont, a Lord of the Admiralty; Antony Keck, a banker; and Thomas Sclater Bacon, a lawyer. There appears to have been some difficulty in getting the required majority to agree to work beginning before 1736, with the four split between Bromley and Beaumont wanting to start and Bacon and Keck set against them. Accordingly, Bromley made plans for work to start not long after 1720, but they were never fulfilled. The early start was to be funded by the high share price of investments in the South Sea Company, which proved overly optimistic.

It was therefore in 1720 that the choice of architect was first considered – Christopher Wren, John Vanbrugh, Thomas Archer, James Thornhill, John James, Nicholas Hawksmoor, and James Gibbs were all considered. By the time the Trustees began to consider the building project, however, their options had reduced: Wren had died in 1723, Vanbrugh in 1724, and Thornhill in 1734. In 1734, Hawksmoor and Gibbs were invited to submit plans. A model, believed to be to Hawksmoor&#x27;s specification, was made in 1734 and presented to the university in 1913. The model was well-received and it appears to have only been Hawksmoor&#x27;s death in 1736 that led the Trustees to appoint Gibbs as architect to the project. Gibbs was given a salary of £100 per annum &quot;for directing and supervising the building of the Radcliffe Library and drawing all plans that shall be necessary for completing that work and corresponding with the builders, and going down four times in every year to see the building&quot;.

On 4 March 1737, the Trustees directed Gibbs along with Francis Smith of Warwick and William Townesend of Oxford &#x27;to prepare Stones and things ready for building the library&#x27;. An early set of plans were engraved and prints delivered to the most important members of the town and University, no doubt to ensure that their opposition was dealt with swiftly. The university in particular seems to have influenced the Trustees&#x27; plan, although the Library would not form part of it. A second set were made a year later. A third set of prints, representing the final plans, were reprinted by Gibbs in his &quot;Bibliotheca Radcliviana&quot; of 1747.

===Construction===
On 17 May 1737, the foundation stone was laid. Four days before, the Trustees had decided on an inscription for it to bear on a copper plate. The whereabouts of neither the stone nor the plate are known, although it is believed that the copper plate adorned a section of the wall that was removed to create the doorway in 1863. That inscription read:

The progress of the building and the craftsmen employed is detailed both in the Minute Books of the Trustees and the Building Book, which supplement information given by Gibbs in his &quot;Bibliotheca Radcliviana&quot;. An extract states:Mr. William Townesend of Oxford, and Mr. William Smith of Warwick, were employed to be masons; Mr. John Philipps to be the carpenter and joiner; Mr. George Devall to be plumber; Mr. Townsend junior to be stone carver; Mr. Linel of Long-acre, London, to be carver in wood; Mr. Artari, an Italian, to be their plaisterer in the fret work way; Mr. Michael Rysbrack to be sculptor, to cut the Doctor&#x27;s figure in marble; and Mr. Blockley to be locksmith.
Francis Smith, the father of William, was chosen as one of the masons, but died in 1738 and was succeeded by his son near the beginning of building. In 1739, John Townesend also succeeded his father on the latter&#x27;s death. The Clerk of Works for most of the construction was Thomas Jersey, who was paid £40 per annum. He was replaced in 1745 by George Shakespeare and shortly thereafter William Robinson. The construction went smoothly until February 1741, save for a short interruption in the latter part of 1740 when the threat of smallpox halted work. It was in February 1741 that there appears to have been either a misunderstanding or a change of plan concerning what the dome was to be constructed out of. It had been partially completed out of stone, to the value of over £700 of stonework completed or prepared, when all work was immediately halted. The Trustees threatened to take the matter to the Court of Chancery if Townesend and Smith pursued their claim for £700 to cover the stonemasons&#x27; bills; the Trustees did not make good this threat and they eventually paid the bill. Part of the stone dome was removed and the dome recovered in timber and lead. 41 tonnes of Derbyshire lead was used on the roof. The incident took over a year to completely resolve. The dome had been completed by March 1743. In 1742 or 1743, when the exterior scaffolding was being removed (only work on the cupola and balustrade remained) two men were killed in an accident. The Trustees approved the payment of £20 to be held on trust for the family of one of the dead men and inquired after the circumstances of the accident and the men injured.

The interior work began once the main structure was complete. John Phillips was employed as a carpenter for the Library&#x27;s floors, windows and bookcases. Joseph Artari was chosen to be the project&#x27;s plasterer, employing Charles Stanley and Thomas Toberts alongside him. In March 1745, the Trustees intervened to help ensure no work was proceeding by candlelight as the Library neared completion. A portrait of Radcliffe was sent to John Michael Rysbrack, who was tasked with creating a six-feet tall marble statue of the Library&#x27;s benefactor. It was installed by Townesend and Smith. The responsibility for the ironwork for the gates for the seven exterior arches of the library was given to Robert Bakewell of Derby. His original estimate proved too low, however, explained by Gibbs to be a result of the French war. It eventually cost £364. The Trustee&#x27;s meeting of 13 March 1746 reveals that the remaining work consisted of the paving of the library inside and out, the staircase rail, and the locks, hinges and bolts for the bookcases.

The exterior of the building was complete by 1747 and the building fully completed in 1748. A librarian was appointed, as was a porter. Before Radcliffe&#x27;s death, the sub-librarian of the Bodleian, Thomas Hearne, was widely considered to have been Radcliffe&#x27;s choice as his new librarian. He was not appointed, however, and the post remained unfilled. In 1737, another sub-librarian, Francis Wise, reached out to several influential figures (including the Duke of Newcastle) to assist him in securing the position. However, by 1741 he had grown deeply weary of the level of competition he faced, particularly from a Richard Green, Radcliffe&#x27;s great-nephew. The position did not go to Green, however: Wise was appointed to the position by a majority of one in 1748. The first porter was Pudsey Mussendine, who was paid a salary of £20 per annum, and received a gown in Radcliffe&#x27;s colours and with his coat of arms emblazoned on it. The opening ceremony was delayed by around a year because of disturbances in Oxford. It finally took place on 13 April 1749.

Work on the exterior continued after the opening of the Library. In 1750, part of the land between the Camera and St. Mary&#x27;s Church was remodelled to remove a dividing wall, level the ground and lay pebbles on it. This cost a total of £158. 17s, of which £100 came from the Trust and the rest from the university. The Old Convocation house was repaired in 1759 at the cost of £144. In 1751, the Trustees also agreed to the construction of twenty obelisks to hold gas lamps, which the university agreed to maintain. Only 14 were actually erected and in 1755 the Trustees reimbursed the University for the cost of maintaining them up to that point and took on the obligation itself out of the £100 per annum left by Radcliffe for the Library&#x27;s upkeep. In 1758–9, for example, they were lit on 89 nights at a cost of £23. 6s. 1d.

===History as an independent library===

The library&#x27;s collection grew only slowly. The first book to be placed in the library was identified by one contemporary account as Thomas Carte&#x27;s &quot;A General History of England&quot;. The first donation was some 50,000 pamphlets from a Mr Bartholomew of University College, subsequently gifted to the Bodleian in 1794. The first major purchase was books to the value of £45 from a seller in Newport in 1751, although they were kept in private possession until 1755. In 1754, the library received a number of books from the estate of James Gibbs, mostly concerning architecture. A number of classical and history books by the bequest of Richard Frewin, Camden Professor of Ancient History, and law books of Charles Viner, the founder of the Vinerian Professorship of Common Law, were also added to the library. Early purchases also included the purchase of the manuscripts of James Fraser to the value of £500, and those of George Sale for £157 10s., both concerned with the Middle East – the first on the advice of Thomas Hunt, Laudian Professor of Arabic. The texts appear to have suffered from poor care after their acquisition. Three further collections were purchased before Wise&#x27;s death in 1767. Even at this early stage, the Trustees appear to have collaborated with the Bodleian to avoid duplication. The Library quickly became known as &#x27;the Physic Library&#x27;. Despite its name, its acquisitions were varied for the first sixty years, but from 1811 its intake was confined to works of a scientific nature. During the first half of the 19th century the collections included coins, marbles, candelabra, busts, plaster casts, and statues. These collections have since been moved to more specifically appropriate sites.

A muniment room was created in 1753 to house the collection documents relating to Radcliffe&#x27;s will and the accumulated deeds of the land on which the library had been built. Despite regular inspections, in 1817, a number of deeds were found to have degraded completely. Although the Trustees did not believe that the particular documents lost were likely to cause many future problems, the remaining manuscripts were moved to the main Library to prevent further damage. In other respects, Wise&#x27;s tenure was marked only by his poor (and worsening) health and poor relations with the university. University members expected to be admitted and the vice-chancellor made it clear to Wise that he believed the library part of the university and thus under his overall control. Wise did not agree, threatening at one point to padlock the library and refer any man who cut it to the courts. The vice-chancellor took this as an unprovoked insult and turned to consideration of the university statutes and the imposition, if they did not already exist, of such statutes as would compel the ageing Wise to attend to his duties from which he was now regularly absent. Five years before his actual death in 1767, a satirical death notice was placed in the London papers announcing the &quot;greatly regretted&quot; death of Wise &quot;[his death] occasioned by a violent cold, contracted by too close attendance on the duties of his respective offices&quot;. In those last years, Wise was so ill that he could no longer attend the library. Upon his death, his collection of coins was presented to the library.

He was replaced by Benjamin Kennicott who served as librarian until his death in 1783. His librarianship saw the purchase of more Arabic, Hebrew and Persian works, the subject of study of Kennicott. Despite several reparative measures, the building continued to fall into disrepair, with Kennicott immersed in his academic study. Comments at the time of his death noted that the collection was &quot;so far from being &#x27;one of the first collections in the Universe,&#x27; that it is even inconsiderable and invaluable when compared, not only with the Bodley collection, but perhaps others in Oxford.&quot; Kennicott&#x27;s successor, Thomas Hornsby, did nothing to improve the situation, devoting much of time to his other post of Radcliffe Observer. There are no records of any books being bought before his death in 1810. There was, however, one controversial benefaction of a series of marbles, with a custodian appointed and funded (along with the cost of securing the statues) by Sir Roger Newdigate. It was eventually accepted, although not without opposition from Hornsby who believed it would distract from the library&#x27;s academic purpose and block readers&#x27; light. Upon Newdigate&#x27;s death, the statues had not been purchased and his executors added to the opposition. The benefaction was reassessed and finally rejected. In the last years of his tenure, Hornsby was asked to provide a catalogue, but no such document was put together before his death.

Hornsby&#x27;s successor was chosen as George Williams. It was under his tenure that &quot;a new era dawned&quot; for the Radcliffe Library. Williams, a physician in the Radcliffe Infirmary and Professor of Botany, adopted an approach which had been mooted a couple of years before to fill the library&#x27;s shelves not with a general collection of works, but rather specifically scientific books. Huge sums were spent from funds which had accumulated from previous years: £2000 in 1814, and around £500 annually for the years after. Dr. Abraham Robertson was asked to donate a copy of the Radcliffe Observatory&#x27;s records each year in exchange for being allowed to borrow certain books. In 1814, the library hosted a banquet for the visiting Prince Regent. The Library also received a number of marble busts and a collection of 1,000 marble specimens. The grounds of the library were enclosed by railings in 1827 at a cost of £1,310, although the ascertainment of the exact extent of the Trustee&#x27;s holdings required careful examination and a previous overlooked transfer completed. Upon Williams&#x27; death in 1834, the Trustees gave an unprecedented statement of thanks; it was echoed by a report in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; which read: &quot;In carrying into effect these great national as well as academic purposes, the Trustees found in Dr. Williams&#x27;s extensive reading, retentive memory... exact judgment, comprehensive views and philosophical mind, the very talents and accomplishments which were necessary to ensure the successful execution of their design&quot;.

Williams was succeeded by John Kidd, Regius Professor of Medicine. Gas heating and lighting was introduced into the library, a third member of staff (an assistant) hired at a salary of £25 per annum, and insurance taken out against the risk of fire – £10,000 to cover the buildings and a further £10,000 for the books. In 1835, the library catalogue was finally published, for which Kidd received £100 by way of bonus. He was, however, unsuccessful in three attempts to secure a pay rise. The book collection continued to expand, with Kidd required to provide a memorandum of books added each year to the library, and the first proper bookcases installed. A visitors&#x27; book was created to distinguish students and academics from &quot;those who visit the Library from mere motives of general curiosity&quot;. In other respects Library life was unremarkable for the rest of Kidd&#x27;s tenure, which ended with his death in 1851.

Henry Wentworth Acland succeeded Kidd as Librarian. He made several structural alterations, creating a reading room, improving the lighting and heating and adding a hot water system. More significantly, in light of the sum of £200 to be spent on books annually, which Acland considered insufficient, he set out a detailed proposal to bring the library under the leadership of the university. In 1856, he laid out his plan to the Trustees, at which point the library contained between 14,000 and 15,000 volumes: &quot;[I fear] the Library be found wanting in some standard work of reference [or] the ordinary Scientific Literature... [while] it is supposed by visitors... that the great collection of scientific works in Oxford is to be found in the Radcliffe Library... the Bodleian Library is far richer in scientific transactions and periodicals; it receives, or ought to receive, without cost all British books... the Radcliffe Library must be accounted to be, and will remain, of much less public utility than is generally supposed.&quot; The Radcliffe Library building was to become a reading room of the Bodleian, and the collection transferred to the new &#x27;Museum Library&#x27; being constructed (now the Radcliffe Science Library). The plan was accepted by both parties and on 23 October 1861 the keys to the Radcliffe Library building were handed to Bodley&#x27;s Librarian. It took four more years to finalise everything. The Radcliffe Library building thus became the Radcliffe Camera as the library ceased to be fully independent. The Trustees retained the freehold to the building, which was finally transferred to the university in 1927.

===Later history as part of the university===
Between 1909 and 1912, an underground book store of two floors was constructed beneath the north lawn of the library with a tunnel connecting it with the Bodleian, invisibly linking the two library buildings, something envisaged by Henry Acland in 1861. It was known as the &quot;Radder&quot; in 1930s slang but was later referred to as &quot;the Radcliffe Link&quot; or &quot;the Link&quot;. This was refurbished as reading rooms, completed in 2011, and is now known as the &quot;Gladstone Link&quot;. 

After the Radcliffe Science Library moved into another building, the Radcliffe Camera became home to additional reading rooms of the Bodleian Library. The interior of the upper reading-room houses a six-foot marble statue of John Radcliffe, carved by John Michael Rysbrack. It now holds books from the English, history, and theology collections, mostly secondary sources found on Undergraduate and Graduate reading lists. There is space for around 600,000 books in rooms beneath Radcliffe Square.

The Radcliffe Camera has been the site of several student-led protests. In November 2010, the building was occupied by students for over twenty-four hours, as part of wider national protest against proposed changes to university funding and substantial increases in the cost of tuition. In October 2023, the building was sprayed with orange paint in a protest by Just Stop Oil against Oxford University&#x27;s links to fossil fuel companies such as Ineos. In May 2024, pro-Palestinian activists set up a tent encampment of the grounds of the Radcliffe Camera as part of the 2024 University of Oxford pro-Palestinian campus occupationsm demanding that Oxford University divest from Israel.

== Architecture ==
The building is the earliest example in England of a circular library. It is built in three main stages externally and two stories internally, the upper one containing a gallery. The ground stage is heavily rusticated and has a series of eight pedimented projections alternating with niches. The central stage is divided into bays by coupled Corinthian columns supporting the continuous entablature. The pedimented windows stand above mezzanine openings, reflecting the interior arrangement. The top stage is a lanterned dome on an octagonal drum, with a balustraded parapet with vases.

The construction used local stone from Headington and Burford, which was then ashlar faced. The dome and cupola are covered with lead. Inside, the original walls and dome were distempered but this was later removed, revealing the decorations to be carved in stone. Only the decorative work of the dome is plaster.

Originally, the basement was an open arched arcade with a vaulted stone ceiling, with Radcliffe&#x27;s coat of arms in the centre. The arcade arches were fitted with iron grilles: three of them were gates which were closed at night, and which gave access to the library by a grand staircase. In 1863, when the building had become a reading-room of the Bodleian, the arches were glazed, a new entrance was created on the north side in place of a circular window, with stone steps leading up to the entrance.

The area around the Library was originally partly paved, partly cobbled, and partly gravelled. In 1751 stone posts and obelisks surmounted by lamps were placed around the perimeter. All but the three at the entrance to Brasenose Lane were removed around 1827 when the lawns were laid and iron railings installed.

==Reception==
The 1744 work &quot;The Present State of the Universities&quot; by Thomas Salmon described the new Radcliffe library as &quot;the most magnificent Structure in Oxford... I find a great many People of Opinion that he intended to perpetuate his Memory by it, and therefore give it the name of &#x27;Radcliffe&#x27;s Mausoleum&#x27;&quot;. This was echoed by &quot;The Gentleman and the Lady&#x27;s Pocket Companion for Oxford&quot; (1747) which said that &quot;the most magnificent structure in Oxford is the new public Library&quot;. In 1773, however, Edward Tatham was not so complimentary: &quot;The writer... cannot help expressing his disapprobation of the situation of the Radclivian Library. Whatever merit this edifice reflects on the architect, and splendor on the University, it certainly destroys the regularity of the area, and intercepts the view of every building in it.&quot; He regarded the north side of Broad Street, south of the gardens of Trinity College, to have been a more suitable site and the chosen site left largely open &quot;as we pronounce in general that the areas in a town should be free, open, and without obstruction&quot;. 

Gibbs later said of the Trustees: &quot;I never observed a trust discharged with greater unanimity, integrity and candor, during the whole time I had the honour of serving you, from the laying of the first stone of this fabric to its finishing.&quot; Contemporaries found great irony in the fact that the iconoclast Radcliffe, who scorned book-learning, should bequeath a substantial sum for the founding of the Radcliffe Library. Sir Samuel Garth quipped that the endowment was &quot;about as logical as if a eunuch should found a seraglio&quot;.

== In popular culture ==

* J. R. R. Tolkien, author of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, remarked that the building resembled Sauron&#x27;s temple to Morgoth on Númenor. It is also mentioned in &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot;.
* Dorothy Sayers&#x27; mystery novel &quot;Gaudy Night&quot; (1936) is set in Oxford, and one of the most important concluding conversations between Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane takes place on the balustraded circular rooftop of the Radcliffe Camera (Chapter XXIII).
* The Camera was used as a location in the films &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1985), &quot;The Opium War&quot; (1997), &quot;The Saint&quot; (1997), &quot;The Red Violin&quot; (1998), and &quot;Wonka&quot; (2023).

<text>The Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology () on Beaumont Street in Oxford, England, is Britain&#x27;s first public museum. Its first building was erected in 1678–1683 to house the cabinet of curiosities that Elias Ashmole gave to the University of Oxford in 1677. It is also the world&#x27;s second university museum, after the establishment of the Kunstmuseum Basel in 1661 by the University of Basel.

The present building was built between 1841 and 1845. The museum reopened in 2009 after a major redevelopment, and in November 2011, new galleries focusing on Egypt and Nubia were unveiled. In May 2016, the museum redisplayed galleries of 19th-century art.

==History==

===Broad Street===
The museum opened on 24 May 1683, with naturalist Robert Plot as the first keeper. The building on Broad Street (later known as the Old Ashmolean) is sometimes attributed to Sir Christopher Wren or Thomas Wood. Elias Ashmole had acquired the collection from the gardeners, travellers, and collectors John Tradescant the Elder and his son, John Tradescant the Younger. It included antique coins, books, engravings, geological specimens, and zoological specimens—one of which was the stuffed body of the last dodo ever seen in Europe; but by 1755 the stuffed dodo was so moth-eaten that it was destroyed, except for its head and one claw.

===Beaumont Street===

The present building dates from 1841 to 1845. It was designed as the University Galleries by Charles Cockerell in a classical style and stands on Beaumont Street. One wing of the building is occupied by the Taylor Institution, the modern languages faculty of the university, standing on the corner of Beaumont Street and St Giles&#x27; Street. This wing of the building was also designed by Charles Cockerell, using the Ionic order of Greek architecture.
Sir Arthur Evans, who was appointed keeper in 1884 and retired in 1908, is largely responsible for the current museum. Evans found that the keeper and the vice-chancellor (Benjamin Jowett) had managed to lose half of the Ashmole collection and had converted the original building into the Examination Rooms. Charles Drury Edward Fortnum had offered to donate his personal collection of antiques on condition that the museum was put on a sound footing. A donation of £10,000 from Fortnum (£ as of 2025) enabled Evans to build an extension to the University Galleries and move the Ashmolean collection there in 1894. In 1908, the Ashmolean and the University Galleries were combined as the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology. The museum became a depository for some of the important archaeological finds from Evans&#x27; excavations in Crete.

After the various specimens had been moved into new museums, the &quot;Old Ashmolean&quot; building was used as office space for the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. Since 1924, the building has been established as the Museum of the History of Science, with exhibitions including the scientific instruments given to Oxford University by Lewis Evans, amongst them the world&#x27;s largest collection of astrolabes.

Charles Buller Heberden left £1,000 (£ as of 2025) to the university in 1921, which was used for the Coin Room at the museum.

In 2012, the Ashmolean was awarded a grant of $1.1m by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to establish the University Engagement Programme or UEP. The programme employs three teaching curators and a programme director to develop the use of the museum&#x27;s collections in the teaching and research of the university.

===Renovations===

The interior of the Ashmolean has been extensively modernised during the early 21st century and now includes a restaurant and large gift shop.

In 2000, the Chinese Picture Gallery, designed by van Heyningen and Haward Architects, opened at the entrance of the Ashmolean and is partly integrated into the structure. It was inserted into a lightwell in the Grade I listed building and was designed to support future construction from its roof. Apart from the original Cockerell spaces, this gallery was the only part of the museum retained in the rebuilding. The gallery houses the Ashmolean&#x27;s own collection and is also used from time to time for the display of loan exhibitions and works by contemporary Chinese artists. It is the only museum gallery in Britain devoted to Chinese paintings.

The Bodleian Art, Archaeology and Ancient World Library (formerly the Sackler Library), incorporating the older library collections of the Ashmolean, opened in 2001 and has allowed an expansion of the book collection, which concentrates on classical civilization, archaeology, and art history.

Between 2006 and 2009, the museum was expanded to the designs of architect Rick Mather and the exhibition design company Metaphor, supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The $98.2 million rebuilding resulted in five floors instead of three, with a doubling of the display space, as well as new conservation studios and an education centre. The renovated museum re-opened on 7 November 2009.

On 26 November 2011, the Ashmolean opened to the public the new galleries of Ancient Egypt and Nubia. This second phase of major redevelopment now allows the museum to exhibit objects that have been in storage for decades, more than doubling the number of coffins and mummies on display. The project received lead support from Lord Sainsbury&#x27;s Linbury Trust, along with the Selz Foundation, Mr Christian Levett, as well as other trusts, foundations, and individuals. Rick Mather Architects led the redesign and display of the four previous Egypt galleries and the extension to the restored Ruskin Gallery, previously occupied by the museum shop.

In May 2016, the museum opened new galleries dedicated to the display of its collection of Victorian art. This development allowed for the return to the Ashmolean of the Great Bookcase, designed by William Burges, and described as &quot;the most important example of Victorian painted furniture ever made.&quot;

==Collections==


The main museum contains huge collections of archaeological specimens and fine art. It has one of the best collections of Pre-Raphaelite paintings, majolica pottery, and English silver. The archaeology department includes the bequest of Arthur Evans and so has a collection of Greek and Minoan pottery.

The group in the painting are Prince Rupert, Colonel William Legge (Governor of Oxford) and Colonel John Russell (commander of the prince&#x27;s elite Blue Coats). The painting was acquired for the nation through the Acceptance in Lieu scheme, administered by Arts Council England.
* In 2017 the museum acquired a Viking hoard that was discovered near Watlington in South Oxfordshire in 2015. It is the first large Viking hoard discovered in Oxfordshire, which once lay on the border of Wessex and Mercia. The hoard contains over 200 Anglo-Saxon coins, including many examples of previously rare coins of Alfred the Great, King of Wessex (871–899) and his less well-known contemporary, King Ceolwulf II of Mercia (874–879).
* In 2015 the Ashmolean raised the money needed to acquire a major painting by J. M. W. Turner. With lead support from the Heritage Lottery Fund, a grant from the Art Fund, and a public appeal, the fundraising target was met to secure Turner&#x27;s only full-size townscape in oils: &quot;The High Street, Oxford&quot; (1810). The painting was accepted by the nation through the Acceptance in Lieu scheme.
* In October 2014 the Ashmolean acquired a painting by John Constable titled &quot;Willy Lott&#x27;s House from the Stour&quot; (The Valley Farm). The painting was accepted by the nation through the Acceptance in Lieu scheme. The farm building depicted in the painting is also seen from a different angle in &quot;The Hay Wain&quot;, painted 1821 and now at the National Gallery.
* In October 2014 the Ashmolean acquired a collection of historic English embroideries which was given to the museum by collectors Micheál and Elizabeth Feller. The gift comprises 61 pieces which span the whole of the seventeenth century.
* In late 2013, art historian and collector Michael Sullivan bequeathed his collection of more than 400 works of art to the museum. The collection, which includes paintings by Chinese masters Qi Baishi, Zhang Daqian, and Wu Guanzhong, was considered one of the world&#x27;s most significant collections of modern Chinese art. The museum has a gallery dedicated to Sullivan and his wife Khoan.
* In 2013 the museum was given the sculpture &quot;Taichi Arch&quot; by Taiwanese artist Ju Ming, which was installed on the museum&#x27;s main forecourt. It was given to the museum by the Juming Culture and Education Foundation in memory of art historian and collector Michael Sullivan.
* In 2012 the museum was left a 500-piece collection of gold and silver objets d&#x27;art, including many pieces of Renaissance silverware, assembled by the antique dealer Michael Welby.
* In 2012 the museum acquired Édouard Manet&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Mademoiselle Claus&quot;, painted in 1868, after a public campaign to raise £7.83million while a temporary export bar was placed on it by the RCEWA The campaign received £5.9m from the Heritage Lottery Fund, and a grant of £850,000 from The Art Fund.

==In popular culture==

===Books===
* The Ashmolean Museum is a minor location within the book &quot;Babel, or the Necessity of Violence&quot;.

===Comics===
* The 21st book in the Belgian comics series &quot;Blake and Mortimer&quot;, titled &quot;The Oath of the Five Lords&quot;, centres around a series of burglaries at the Ashmolean and their connection to T. E. Lawrence.

===Television===
*The Alfred Jewel was the inspiration for the &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; episode &quot;The Wolvercote Tongue&quot; (1988), in which the museum&#x27;s interior was used as a set. 
* The Ashmolean also figures prominently in several episodes of the successor series &quot;Lewis&quot;, particularly the episode &quot;Point of Vanishing&quot; where the painting &quot;The Hunt in the Forest&quot; () is a key plot element; the characters visit the painting at the museum and are instructed on its features by an art expert before solving the case.

==Theft==

On 31 December 1999, during the fireworks that accompanied the celebration of the millennium, thieves used scaffolding on an adjoining building to climb onto the roof of the museum and stole Cézanne&#x27;s landscape painting &quot;View of Auvers-sur-Oise&quot;. Valued at £3 million, the painting has been described as an important work illustrating the transition from early to mature Cézanne painting. As the thieves ignored other works in the same room, and the stolen Cézanne has not been offered for sale, it is speculated that this was a case of an artwork stolen to order. The Cézanne has not been recovered and is one of the FBI&#x27;s Top Ten Art Crimes.

In 2010 several of the Egypt Exploration Society&#x27;s Oxyrhynchus Papyri held by the museum were allegedly stolen from the collection and sold to the American &quot;Museum of the Bible&quot;.

===Repatriation of artifacts===
In 2024, the museum agreed to return a 500-year-old bronze sculpture of the Hindu poet and saint Thirumangai Alvar that it had purchased at an auction at Sotheby&#x27;s in 1967, after the Indian High Commission in the United Kingdom filed a claim stating that the item was stolen from a temple in Tamil Nadu in 1957.

<text>The Bodleian Library () is the main research library of the University of Oxford. Founded in 1602 by Sir Thomas Bodley, it is one of the oldest libraries in Europe. With over 13 million printed items, it is the second-largest library in Britain after the British Library. Under the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003, it is one of six legal deposit libraries for works published in the United Kingdom, and under Irish law it is entitled to request a copy of each book published in the Republic of Ireland. Known to Oxford scholars as &quot;Bodley&quot; or &quot;the Bod&quot;, it operates principally as a reference library and, in general, documents may not be removed from the reading rooms.

In 2000, a number of libraries within the University of Oxford were brought together for administrative purposes under the aegis of what was initially known as Oxford University Library Services (OULS), and since 2010 as the Bodleian Libraries, of which the Bodleian Library is the largest component.

All colleges of the University of Oxford have their own libraries, which in a number of cases were established well before the foundation of the Bodleian, and all of which remain entirely independent of the Bodleian. They do, however, participate in SOLO (Search Oxford Libraries Online), the Bodleian Libraries&#x27; online union catalogue, except for University College, which has an independent catalogue. Much of the library&#x27;s archives were digitized and put online for public access in 2015.

==Sites and regulations==
The Bodleian Library occupies a group of five buildings near Broad Street: the 15th-century Duke Humfrey&#x27;s Library, the 17th-century Schools Quadrangle, the 18th-century Clarendon Building and Radcliffe Camera, and the 20th- and 21st-century Weston Library. Since the 19th century, underground stores have been constructed, while the principal off-site storage area is located at South Marston on the edge of Swindon.

===Admission===
Before being granted access to the library, new readers are required to agree to a formal declaration. This declaration was traditionally an oral oath, but is now usually made by signing a letter to a similar effect. Ceremonies in which readers recite the declaration are still performed for those who wish to take them; these occur primarily at the start of the university&#x27;s Michaelmas term. External readers (those not attached to the university) are still required to recite the declaration orally prior to admission. The Bodleian Admissions Office has amassed a large collection of translations of the declaration—covering over one hundred different languages as of spring 2017—allowing those who are not native English speakers to recite it in their first language. The English text of the declaration is as follows:
This is a translation of the traditional Latin oath (the original version of which did not forbid tobacco smoking, though libraries were then unheated because fires were so hazardous):


==History==
===14th and 15th centuries===

Whilst the Bodleian Library, in its current incarnation, has a continuous history dating back to 1602, its roots date back even further. The first purpose-built library known to have existed in Oxford was founded in the 14th century under the will of Thomas Cobham, Bishop of Worcester (d. 1327). This small collection of chained books was situated above the north side of the University Church of St Mary the Virgin on the High Street. This collection continued to grow steadily, but when Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester (brother of Henry V of England) donated a great collection of manuscripts between 1435 and 1437, the space was deemed insufficient and a larger building was required. A suitable room was finally built above the Divinity School, and completed in 1488. This room continues to be known as Duke Humfrey&#x27;s Library. After 1488, the university stopped spending money on the library&#x27;s upkeep and acquisitions, and manuscripts began to go unreturned to the library.

===Sir Thomas Bodley and the re-founding of the University Library===
The library went through a period of decline in the late 16th century: the library&#x27;s furniture was sold, and only three of the original books belonging to Duke Humphrey remained in the collection. During the reign of Edward VI, there was a purge of &quot;superstitious&quot; (Catholic-related) manuscripts. 

It was not until 1598 that the library began to thrive once more, when Thomas Bodley wrote to the Vice Chancellor of the university offering to support the development of the library: &quot;where there hath bin hertofore a publike library in Oxford: which you know is apparent by the rome it self remayning, and by your statute records I will take the charge and cost upon me, to reduce it again to his former use.&quot; 

Bodley was a former fellow of Merton College, who had recently married a wealthy widow, and the son of John Bodley (d. 15 Oct. 1591) a Protestant merchant who chose foreign exile rather than staying in England under the Roman Catholic government of Queen Mary, and was thereby involved in Rowland Hill&#x27;s publication of the Geneva Bible.

Six of the Oxford University dons were tasked with helping Bodley in refitting the library in March 1598. Duke Humfrey&#x27;s Library was refitted, and Bodley donated some of his own books to furnish it. The library was formally re-opened on 8 November 1602 under the name &quot;Bodleian Library&quot; (officially Bodley&#x27;s Library). There were around 2,000 books in the library at this time, with an ornate Benefactor&#x27;s Register displayed prominently, to encourage donations. Early benefactors were motivated by the recent memory of the Reformation to donate books in the hopes that they would be kept safe.

Bodley&#x27;s collecting interests were varied; according to the library&#x27;s historian Ian Philip, as early as June 1603 he was attempting to source manuscripts from Turkey, and it was during &quot;the same year that the first Chinese book was acquired&quot;, despite no-one at Oxford being able to understand them at that time. In 1605, Francis Bacon gave the library a copy of &quot;The Advancement of Learning&quot; and described the Bodleian as &quot;an Ark to save learning from deluge&quot;. At this time, there were few books written in English held in the library, partially because academic work was not done in English. Thomas James suggested that Bodley should ask the Stationers&#x27; Company to provide a copy of all books printed to the Bodleian and in 1610 Bodley made an agreement with the company to put a copy of every book registered with them in the library. The Bodleian collection grew so fast that the building was expanded between 1610 and 1612 (known as the Arts End), and again in 1634–1637. When John Selden died in 1654, he left the Bodleian his large collection of books and manuscripts. The later addition to Duke Humfrey&#x27;s Library continues to be known as the &quot;Selden End&quot;.

By 1620, 16,000 items were in the Bodleian&#x27;s collection. Anyone who wanted to use the Bodleian had to buy a copy of the 1620 library catalogue at a cost of 2 shillings and 8 pence.

===Schools Quadrangle and Tower of the Five Orders===
By the time of Bodley&#x27;s death in 1613, his planned further expansion to the library was just starting. The Schools Quadrangle (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Old Schools Quadrangle&quot;, or the &quot;Old Library&quot;) was built between 1613 and 1619 by adding three wings to the Proscholium and Arts End. Its tower forms the main entrance to the library, and is known as the Tower of the Five Orders. The Tower is so named because it is ornamented, in ascending order, with the columns of each of the five orders of classical architecture: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite.

The three wings of the quadrangle have three floors: rooms on the ground and upper floors of the quadrangle (excluding Duke Humfrey&#x27;s Library, above the Divinity School) were originally used as lecture space and an art gallery. The lecture rooms are still indicated by the inscriptions over the doors (see illustration). As the library&#x27;s collections expanded, these rooms were gradually taken over, the university lectures and examinations were moved into the newly created University Schools building. The art collection was transferred to the Ashmolean. One of the schools was used to host exhibitions of the library&#x27;s treasures, now moved to the renovated Weston Library, whilst the others are used as offices and meeting rooms for the library administrators, a readers&#x27; common room, and a small gift shop.


===Later 17th and 18th centuries===
The agreement with the Stationers&#x27; Company meant that the growth of stock was constant and there were also a number of large bequests and acquisitions for other reasons. Until the establishment of the British Museum in 1753, the Bodleian was effectively the national library of England. By then the Bodleian, Cambridge University Library and the Royal Library were the most extensive book collections in England and Wales.

The astronomer Thomas Hornsby observed the transit of Venus from the Tower of the Five Orders in 1769.

The library was significantly supplied by the Strasbourg company Treuttel &amp; Würtz. A large collection of medieval Italian manuscripts was bought from Matteo Luigi Canonici in 1817. In 1829, the library bought the collection of Rabbi David Oppenheim, adding to its Hebrew collection.

===Radcliffe Camera===
By the late 19th century, further growth of the library demanded more expansion space. In 1860, the library was allowed to take over the adjacent building, the Radcliffe Camera. In 1861, the library&#x27;s medical and scientific collections were transferred to the Radcliffe Science Library, which had been built farther north next to the University Museum.

===Clarendon Building===
The Clarendon Building was designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor and built between 1711 and 1715, originally to house the printing presses of the Oxford University Press. It was vacated by the Press in the early 19th century, and used by the university for administrative purposes. In 1975, it was handed over to the Bodleian Library, and now provides office and meeting space for senior members of staff.

===20th century and after===

In 1907, the head librarian, Nicholson, had begun a project to revise the catalogue of printed books. In 1909, the prime minister of Nepal, Chandra Shum Shere, donated a large collection of Sanskrit literature to the library.

In 1911, the Copyright Act (now superseded by the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003) continued the Stationers&#x27; agreement by making the Bodleian one of the six (at that time) libraries covering legal deposit in the United Kingdom where a copy of each published book must be deposited.

Between 1909 and 1912, an underground bookstack was constructed beneath the Radcliffe Camera and Radcliffe Square, known since 2011 as the Gladstone Link. In 1914, the total number of books in the library&#x27;s collections exceeded 1 million. By 1915, only one quarter of the revised catalogue had been completed, a task made more difficult by library staff going into the war effort, either serving in the armed forces or volunteering to serve in the hospitals. In July 1915, the most valuable books had been moved into a secret location due to a fear that Oxford would be bombed, and a volunteer fire brigade was trained and ready, but Oxford escaped the First World War without being bombed. By the 1920s, the Library needed further expansion space, and in 1937 building work began on the New Bodleian building, opposite the Clarendon Building on the northeast corner of Broad Street.

The New Bodleian was designed by architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. Construction was completed in 1940. The building was of an innovative ziggurat design, with 60% of the bookstack below ground level. A tunnel under Broad Street connects the Old and New Bodleian buildings, and contains a pedestrian walkway, a mechanical book conveyor and a pneumatic Lamson tube system which was used for book orders until an electronic automated stack request system was introduced in 2002. The Lamson tube system continued to be used by readers requesting manuscripts to be delivered to Duke Humfrey&#x27;s Library until it was turned off in July 2009. In 2010, it was announced that the conveyor, which had been transporting books under Broad Street since the 1940s, would be shut down and dismantled on 20 August 2010. The New Bodleian closed on 29 July 2011 prior to rebuilding.

===Present and future of the libraries===

The New Bodleian building was rebuilt behind its original façade to provide improved storage facilities for rare and fragile material, as well as better facilities for readers and visitors. The new building concept was designed by WilkinsonEyre and the MEP design was undertaken by engineering consultancy Hurley Palmer Flatt. It reopened to readers as the Weston Library on 21 March 2015. In March 2010, the group of libraries known collectively as &quot;Oxford University Library Services&quot; was renamed &quot;The Bodleian Libraries&quot;, thus allowing those Oxford members outside the Bodleian to acquire the gloss of the Bodleian brand. The building was nominated for the 2016 Sterling Prize.

In November 2015, its collections topped 12 million items with the acquisition of Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Poetical Essay on the Existing State of Things&quot;. Thought lost from shortly after its publication in 1811 until a copy was rediscovered in a private collection in 2006, the Bodleian has digitised the 20-page pamphlet for online access. The controversial poem and accompanying essay are believed to have contributed to the poet being sent down from Oxford University.

==Copying and preservation of material==

The library operates a strict policy on copying of material. Until fairly recently, personal photocopying of library material was not permitted, as there was concern that copying and excessive handling would result in damage. However, individuals may now copy most material produced after 1900, and a staff-mediated service is provided for certain types of material dated between 1801 and 1900. Handheld scanners and digital cameras are also permitted for use on most post-1900 publications and digital cameras may also be used, with permission, with older material. The Library will supply digital scans of most pre-1801 material. Microform copies have been made of many of the most fragile items in the library&#x27;s collection, and these are substituted for the originals whenever possible. The library publishes digital images of objects in its collection through its Digital Bodleian service.

==Bodley&#x27;s Librarians==

The head of the Bodleian Library is known as &quot;Bodley&#x27;s Librarian&quot;. The first librarian, Thomas James, was selected by Bodley in 1599, and the university confirmed James in his post in 1602. Bodley wanted his librarian to be &quot;some one that is noted and known for a diligent Student, and in all his conversation to be trusty, active, and discreet, a graduate also and a Linguist, not encumbered with marriage, nor with a benefice of Cure&quot;, although James was able to persuade Bodley to let him get married and to become Rector of St Aldate&#x27;s Church, Oxford. James said of the Bodleian&#x27;s collections, &quot;The like Librarie is no where to be found.&quot;

In all, 25 have served as Bodley&#x27;s Librarian; their levels of diligence have varied over the years. Thomas Lockey (1660–1665) was regarded as not fit for the post, John Hudson (1701–1719) has been described as &quot;negligent if not incapable&quot;, and John Price (1768–1813) was accused by a contemporary scholar of &quot;a regular and constant neglect of his duty&quot;.

Sarah Thomas, who served from 2007 to 2013, was the first woman to hold the position, and the second librarian (after her predecessor, Reginald Carr) also to be director of Oxford University Library Services (now Bodleian Libraries). Thomas, an American, was also the first foreign librarian to run the Bodleian. Her successor from January 2014 is Richard Ovenden, who was deputy librarian under Thomas.

==In popular culture==
===Novels===
The Bodleian is one of the libraries consulted by Christine Greenaway (one of Bodley&#x27;s librarians) in Colin Dexter&#x27;s Inspector Morse novel &quot;The Wench Is Dead&quot; (1989). The denouement of Michael Innes&#x27;s &quot;Operation Pax&quot; (1951) is set in an imaginary version of the underground bookstack, reached at night by sliding down the &quot;Mendip cleft&quot;, a chute concealed in Radcliffe Square.

Since J. R. R. Tolkien had studied philology at Oxford and eventually became a professor, many of Tolkien&#x27;s manuscripts are now at the library.

Historian and novelist Deborah Harkness, set much of the early part of her 2011 novel, &quot;A Discovery of Witches&quot;, in the Bodleian, particularly the Selden End. The novel also features one of the library&#x27;s Ashmole manuscripts (Ashmole 782) as a central element of the book.

Medieval historian Dominic Selwood set part of his 2013 crypto-thriller &quot;The Sword of Moses&quot; in Duke Humfrey&#x27;s Library, and the novel hinges on the library&#x27;s copy of a magical medieval Hebrew manuscript known as &quot;The Sword of Moses&quot;.

===Location filming===
The Library&#x27;s architecture has made it a popular location for filmmakers, representing either Oxford University or other locations. It can be seen in the opening scene of &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; (2007), &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; (1981 TV serial), &quot;Wonka&quot; (2023), &quot;Another Country&quot; (1984), &quot;The Madness of King George III&quot; (1994), and the first two, as well as the fourth, &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, in which the Divinity School doubles as the Hogwarts hospital wing and the room in which Professor McGonagall teaches the students to dance, as well as Duke Humfrey&#x27;s Library as the Hogwarts library.

<text>Van is a census-designated place (CDP) in Boone County, West Virginia, United States, along the Pond Fork of the Little Coal River. As of the 2010 census, its population was 211. Its ZIP code is 25206. Van was named after Van Linville, who established its post office and served as its first postmaster.

==Geography==

Van is one of the many small communities on West Virginia Route 85, which winds through valley after valley staying close beside the Little Coal River. Van is mostly residential with a gas station, a pharmacy, a flower shop, a few churches, a pizza take out, an elementary school, a junior/senior high school, a Christian school, a volunteer fire department, an Ambulance Station, and a Senior Nutrition Center. The Pond Fork of the Little Coal river that runs through Van is a designated stream that the West Virginia Department of Natural Resources stocks fish, such as trout, a few times a year.

==Schools==

Van High School, which was formerly known as Crook District High School, is nestled up on &quot;The Hill&quot; overlooking the rural town of Van. Van Junior-Senior High School and Van Elementary School are both located on Bulldog Blvd.

Van High School has also been very successful in athletics as it competes in the West Virginia Secondary Schools Activities Commission. Its mascot is a Bulldog and its school colors are Blue and Gold. The Bulldogs compete in Class Single A, which is the smallest of three classes in West Virginia. Van High is one of only three high schools in Boone County.

They have won sectional finals in 1977(AA), 1995(A), 1996(A), and 2002(A). In 1991–1992, a multimillion-dollar gymnasium was built to take the place of one of the only &quot;domed&quot; gyms in West Virginia.

<doc id="86735" wikidata="Q114355" url="?curid=86735" title="Héctor Camacho">
<text>Héctor Luís Camacho Matías (May 24, 1962 – November 24, 2012), commonly known by his nickname &quot;Macho&quot; Camacho, was a Puerto Rican professional boxer and entertainer. Known for his quickness in the ring and flamboyant style, Camacho competed professionally from 1980 to 2010, and was a world champion in three weight classes. He held the WBC super featherweight title from 1983 to 1984, the WBC lightweight title from 1985 to 1987, and the WBO junior welterweight title twice between 1989 and 1992.

In a storied amateur career, Camacho won three New York Golden Gloves tournaments, beginning with the Sub-Novice 112 lbs championship in 1978. During his professional career, Camacho had many notable fights against some of the biggest names in boxing, defeating Roberto Durán twice late in Duran&#x27;s career, and knocking out Sugar Ray Leonard. He also fought Julio César Chávez, Félix Trinidad, and Oscar De La Hoya, among others.

During his later years, Camacho expanded his popular role and appeared on a variety of Spanish-language reality television shows including Univision&#x27;s&#x27; dancing show &quot;Mira Quien Baila&quot; and a weekly segment on the popular show &quot;El Gordo y La Flaca&quot;, named &quot;Macho News&quot;. However, he also had much-publicized troubles with drug abuse and criminal charges. In 2005, Camacho was arrested for burglary, a charge to which he would later plead guilty. In 2011 he was shot at three times by would-be carjackers in San Juan, but was uninjured. In late 2012, Camacho was awaiting trial in Florida on charges of physical abuse of one of his sons.

On November 20, 2012, Camacho was shot and seriously wounded while sitting in a car outside a bar in his native Bayamón; the driver, a childhood friend, was killed in the shooting. Camacho died four days later; after he was declared clinically brain dead, his mother requested the doctors remove him from life support. After lying in repose for two days in Santurce, Camacho&#x27;s remains were transported to New York for burial at the request of his mother.

==Early life and amateur career==
Héctor Luís Camacho Matías was born in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, to Héctor Luis Camacho Sr. and his wife María Matías. He was the second youngest of five children, which included a younger brother, Felix and sisters Raquel, Estrella, and Esperanza. When he was three, his parents separated, and his mother took the children with her to New York City. They lived in the James Weldon Johnson housing project in Spanish Harlem. Camacho attended local schools and ran into trouble as a teen, getting into street fights and landing in jail at fifteen. Pat Flannery, a language teacher in high school, helped the youth, teaching him to read and &quot;acting like a father figure&quot;. When Camacho learned boxing and karate as a teenager, Flannery guided him to the Golden Gloves competitions. Demonstrating talent as a boxer, Camacho chose that sport as a career.

As an amateur, Camacho won three New York Golden Gloves Championships. Camacho won the 1978 112 lb Sub-Novice Championship, 1979 118 lb Open Championship, and 1980 119 lb Open Championship. In 1979 Camacho defeated Paul DeVorce of the Yonkers Police Athletic League in the finals to win the title, and, in 1980, Camacho defeated Tyrone Jackson in the finals to win the Championship.

In 1980 Camacho won Intercity Golden Gloves, defeating Orlando Johnson of Chicago.

Camacho completed his amateur career, having a hundred fights under his belt, with 96 wins, and 4 losses.

Camacho&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Macho&quot; has been explained in various ways. According to his father, he gave him the nickname because he was his youngest son. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, his mentor Pat Flannery is the one who gave him the nickname during his teens. According to Camacho himself, the nickname came as a result of American co-workers at a factory who couldn&#x27;t pronounce his last name.

===Amateur Highlights===
Camacho&#x27;s major achievements in the amateur boxing:
* 1978 New York Golden Gloves Flyweight Sub-Novice Champion
* 1979 New York Golden Gloves Bantamweight Open Champion
* 1979 Intercity Golden Gloves 119-Pound Champion
* 1980 New York Golden Gloves Bantamweight Open Champion
* 1980 Intercity Golden Gloves 125-Pound Champion

==Professional career==
After a stellar amateur career, Camacho began a quick rise through the professional rankings, first in the featherweight and then in the junior-lightweight division. He was so confident that he claimed he could beat world featherweight champions Salvador Sánchez and Eusebio Pedroza. However, Sánchez died while Camacho was still coming up in the ranks. In the junior-lightweight division, he defeated the top contenders Irleis &quot;Cubanito&quot; Perez, Melvin Paul, John Montes, and Refugio Rojas.

===Super featherweight===

When the World Junior Lightweight champion, Bobby Chacón, refused to go to Puerto Rico to defend his title against Camacho, the World Boxing Council (WBC) declared the world championship vacant. Rafael Limón, who had been defeated and lost the championship to Chacon, fought Camacho for the vacant title. It was the first time Camacho was in a ring with a former world champion; he scored a knockdown on Limón late in the third round and twice more in the fifth round before the referee stopped it.

Camacho also fought his first defense in San Juan, where he met Rafael Solis, a fellow Puerto Rican. He knocked out Solis with a right to the chin in round five, and retained the title.

===Lightweight===
Moving up to lightweight, Camacho won the United States Boxing Association title against Roque Montoya with a twelve-round decision. His victory in the next fight, broadcast on Home Box Office (HBO), made him a two-time world champion. Camacho beat the Mexican defending world champion, José Luis Ramírez in Las Vegas to win the WBC world Lightweight championship. Camacho dropped Ramirez in round three and won the fight by a unanimous twelve-round decision.

The two other reigning world champions in his division at that time, Livingstone Bramble and Jimmy Paul, were reluctant to unify the crown with Camacho. Instead, he beat Freddie Roach before his next fight of importance came along, ten months after beating Ramírez.

He met former WBC lightweight champion Edwin Rosario on June 13, 1986, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, a bout also broadcast on HBO. The fight was notable for the shifts of dominance between the men. Camacho dominated rounds one to four, but had to hang on in rounds five, six and seven, when he felt Rosario&#x27;s power. He came back to take rounds eight and nine, but Rosario came back to take the last three rounds. It was a close fight, but Camacho retained the title by a split decision of the judges.

Camacho retained his title against Cornelius Boza-Edwards, a former world junior lightweight champion, in Miami in a unanimous decision, after dropping Edwards in the first round.

===Light welterweight===

He went up in weight and competed at the next level. After a few fights there, he met Ray &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Mancini, the former world lightweight champion who had a record of 29–3 with 23 knockouts, for the vacant WBO Light Welterweight title. Camacho was the fresher of the two and won a split twelve-round decision. He joined that exclusive group of world champion boxers who have become world champions in three weight divisions.

Camacho&#x27;s next rival of note was Vinny Pazienza, whom he defeated on points. His next challenger was Tony Baltazar, from Phoenix. He defeated Baltazar by points in a fight televised by HBO. His undefeated streak came to an end, and he lost his world championship to Greg Haugen, the former world Lightweight champion. The referee had deducted one point from Camacho for refusing to touch gloves with Haugen at the start of the 12th round. After the fight, an unidentified substance was found in Haugen&#x27;s urine, and a rematch was ordered. Camacho regained the title, beating Haugen in a close split decision.

In 1992 in Las Vegas, Camacho met Julio César Chávez, a formidable Mexican champion who was undefeated 81–0. Camacho entered the ring in an outfit based on the Puerto Rican flag; the fight was televised by Showtime&#x27;s Pay Per View. Camacho was later criticized by some in the boxing press for his retreating tactics during the fight; Chávez kept pushing the fight and harassed him with hard punches to the body. The bout ended with a victory for Chávez by unanimous decision.

Since 1992 Camacho&#x27;s notable fights included two victories (by points) over Roberto Durán, (one in Atlantic City, the other in Denver). In 1997, he knocked out Sugar Ray Leonard in five rounds. This loss sent the forty-one-year-old Leonard into permanent retirement, putting an end to his third comeback attempt six years after a loss to Terry Norris in 1991.

===Welterweight and later career===

Camacho fought for the World Welterweight Championship against Félix Trinidad (1994) and Oscar De La Hoya (1997), but he lost both matches by unanimous decisions.

On December 5, 2003, Camacho faced Craig Houk. It was an odd fight, as Houk continuously turned his back on Camacho throughout the fight. Camacho had Houk in trouble in the first round before Houk caught an overzealous Camacho with a left hook and floored him, the third knockdown against him in his career. Camacho bounced back up and battered Houk for the remainder of the round. He knocked Houk near the end of the first and eventually won by knockout in round three. He won consecutive unanimous ten-round decisions over Clinton McNeil and Raúl Jorge Muñoz. After that, his boxing career went on hiatus, as he faced criminal charges. He pled guilty to burglary and acknowledged drug abuse, but was given probation.

Camacho returned to boxing on July 18, 2008, competing against Perry Ballard for the World Boxing Empire&#x27;s Middleweight Championship. The fight lasted seven rounds. Camacho won when Ballard&#x27;s corner threw the towel. Before this fight, Camacho was trained by Angelo Dundee. His last two fights resulted in a draw and a loss, against Luis Ramón Campas and Saúl Duran, respectively. His last fight against Duran was on May 14, 2010.

==Later years and troubles==
===2005 burglary===
On January 6, 2005, Camacho was arrested by police in Gulfport, Mississippi on charges of trying to burglize an electronic goods store and carrying the drug ecstasy on him. In 2007, he pleaded guilty to being under the influence at the time of the burglary. He was sentenced to 7 years in prison, but a judge eventually suspended all but one year of the sentence and gave Camacho probation. He served two weeks in jail after violating that probation.

===2011 shooting===
On February 12, 2011, Camacho was attacked near the Luis Lloréns Torres housing project in San Juan. Camacho said he was taking a friend to a nearby bar when two men approached his vehicle (a 2005 BMW X5) and tried to carjack him. When he tried to drive away, they shot at him three times. He said that since &quot;everybody loves me,&quot; he didn&#x27;t think the men had realized who he was. He did not file a police report.

==2012 shooting and death==
On November 20, 2012, around 7 p.m. AST, Camacho was shot once in the jaw while sitting in a car, on Puerto Rico Highway 167, in Bayamón. Camacho, 50, was seated in the passenger seat of a friend&#x27;s Ford Mustang when he was shot by unknown individuals from a passing SUV. The driver of the car, Adrian Mojica Moreno, Camacho&#x27;s childhood friend, was killed in the attack. Camacho was taken to San Pablo Hospital in Bayamón, where he was reported to be in critical condition. Police said a chase took place and that the vehicle from which the shots were fired was found in the area of Jardines de Cataño. There were conflicting media reports, with an early claim that police arrested a suspect around 9 p.m. AST. Police investigating the incident said they found nine bags of cocaine in the car.

The bullet pierced Camacho&#x27;s left mandible and fractured his fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae, lodging in his right shoulder and forming a lesion on his carotid artery that restricted blood flow to his brain. At one point doctors announced Camacho was expected to survive but might be paralyzed, but after he suffered a cardiac arrest during the night, doctors said they could find only minimal brain activity. The morning after the shooting, Rafael Rodríguez Mercado, director of the Medical Sciences Campus, reported to &quot;El Nuevo Día&quot; that Camacho was brain stem dead. &quot;His full recovery would be a miracle; medically there is nothing more that can be done,&quot; stated Rodríguez Mercado. This was confirmed the next morning by Ernesto Torres, director of the hospital.

Camacho&#x27;s mother Maria Matias announced on November 23 plans to have her son taken off life support once his three remaining sons arrived in Puerto Rico to be with him. Héctor Camacho was officially declared dead after a heart attack the following day. It was not possible for any of his organs to be donated to recipients because of the time that had passed between him being found clinically brain dead and when his heart stopped.

He is survived by his parents, his sons, two grandsons, his brother Félix and his sisters Raquel, Estrella and Esperanza. His oldest son, Hector Camacho Jr., said violence had overtaken Puerto Rico. &quot;Death, jail, drugs, killings,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#x27;s what the streets are now.&quot;
Puerto Rico&#x27;s former governor, Luis Fortuno, said &quot;&#x27;Macho&#x27; will always be remembered for his spontaneity and charisma in and out of the ring.&quot; Puerto Rican governor-elect, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, said Camacho had &quot;united the country&quot;; &quot;We celebrated his triumphs in the streets and we applauded him with noble sportsmanship when he didn&#x27;t prevail.&quot; Asked how he wished his son to be remembered, his father said for his clowning around and that he was a happy person, that he had revolutionized boxing by how he was dressed upon entering the ring.

===Funeral and burial===
After Camacho&#x27;s death, his mother, María Matías, expressed the wish for her son to be buried in New York City, where he had grown up and started his fighting career. Camacho&#x27;s son Héctor Camacho Jr. thought he should be buried in Puerto Rico, but agreed to his grandmother&#x27;s and aunts&#x27; wishes.

Before being taken to the mainland United States, Camacho&#x27;s body lay in state at the Puerto Rico Department of Sports and Recreation in Santurce. During the two days Camacho&#x27;s body was on viewing, hundreds of people visited the facilities to pay tribute to the fighter.

Dozens of retired and active boxers from Puerto Rico and abroad were among those who participated in the funeral services. Among them were Félix &quot;Tito&quot; Trinidad, Wilfred Benítez, Wilfredo Gómez, John John Molina, Samuel Serrano, Román &quot;Rocky&quot; Martínez, Juan Manuel López, Nelson Dieppa, Alex &quot;El Nene&quot; Sánchez, Julian Solís, Manny Siaca, and the brothers McWilliams and McJoe Arroyo. Trinidad was outspoken in praise for his former rival, saying Camacho &quot;put Puerto Rico&#x27;s flag up high, with a lot of pride like many other champions have done. He was very loved. You can see how everybody has suffered the loss of this great human being, a great champion.&quot; Trinidad regretted the circumstances of the fatal shooting.

Camacho&#x27;s body was flown to New York City on November 29 and presented at Elcock Funeral Home in Queens. On Friday, his body was taken to Saint Cecilia&#x27;s Church in Manhattan for a religious service. Camacho was buried on December 1 in Saint Raymond&#x27;s Cemetery in the Bronx. Before the burial, a parade was held in Camacho&#x27;s honor in East Harlem. Two white horses pulled a hearse carriage up First Avenue surrounded by fans, friends and family of the late boxer. Camacho&#x27;s casket was draped in a Puerto Rican flag. After a visitation and mass at St. Cecilia&#x27;s Church on East 106th Street on November 30 and December 1, Camacho was buried on the afternoon of December 1, 2012, in Saint Raymond&#x27;s Cemetery, Bronx in the Throggs Neck section of the Bronx.

===Aftermath and investigation===
Almost ten years later, on March 9, 2022, the Department of Justice of Puerto Rico arrested five suspects. William Rodríguez Rodríguez, Luis Ayala García, and Joshua Méndez Romero were serving federal sentences for unrelated crimes, and were flown in from Florida as part of what police called &quot;Operation Knockout.&quot; The fourth suspect, Jesús Naranjo Adorno, was arrested in morning hours in the same city where Camacho was killed, and the fifth suspect, Juan Luis Figueroa Rivera, remains in prison in Puerto Rico for an unrelated case. Authorities also stated that two other suspects were killed in 2013 and 2015, in unrelated events.

==Legacy and honors==
Several sports journalists, analysts, and experts from Puerto Rico and United States have praised Camacho&#x27;s skills and influence in the boxing world. The journalist Rafael Bracero and Francisco Valcárcel, president of the World Boxing Organization, agreed that Camacho was among the &quot;Top 5 Puerto Rican boxers&quot; of all time, along with Félix &quot;Tito&quot; Trinidad, Wilfredo Gómez, and Wilfred Benítez. The boxing historian, Mario Rivera Martinó, praised Camacho, calling him a &quot;complete fighter&quot; in the Lightweight division. José Sulaimán stated that he &quot;revolutionized boxing during his time&quot;.

Ed Brophy, director of the International Boxing Hall of Fame, noted Camacho&#x27;s talents in attracting an audience. He said, &quot;Camacho brought a lot of excitement to boxing. He was bright, colorful, and always gave something to talk about with his walks to the ring, with his unique style of entering, and the costumes he wore.&quot; Brophy also praised Camacho&#x27;s boxing skills, describing him as &quot;an exciting fighter, and one of the greats. He faced the best, going up and down several divisions.&quot; Alfredo R. Martínez, senior editor of ESPN Deportes, also noted Camacho&#x27;s flamboyant approach, saying that &quot;if he wasn&#x27;t the first, he was one of the firsts that entered the ring with extravagant costumes, feather crests, bright clothes, everything to the rhythm of some pop song&quot;.

Hiram Martínez, senior editor of ESPN Deportes, said about Camacho&#x27;s training:

he transforms into a hungry, focused, and dedicated boxer, that works hours and hours polishing his speed, his wit, and the style that turned him into one of the greats of all time. That&#x27;s the only way you can explain why all those great hitters he faced during the best moments of his career never knocked him down.

Jaime Vega-Curry (deputy editor of ESPN Deportes), said Camacho was &quot;a character that combined a contagious charisma, impressive boxing quality, a child&#x27;s soul, a salesman&#x27;s shrewdness, and a superlative confidence on himself and in the force of his &#x27;Macho Time&#x27;&quot;

Brophy noted Camacho would be eligible for the International Boxing Hall of Fame in December 2015. He added that &quot;Camacho is part of boxing history, and that&#x27;s what the International Boxing Hall of Fame is about.&quot;

Camacho, along with Lupe Pintor and Hilario Zapata, among others, was voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in December 2015 and was inducted in June 2016.

Noted boxing biographer Christian Giudice wrote a book about Camacho&#x27;s life titled &quot;Macho Time: The Meteoric Rise and Tragic Fall of Hector Camacho&quot;, which was released on October 20, 2020, by Hamilcar Publications.

Hector&#x27;s fiancée, Shelly Salemassi, published a book of their real life story called The Lady and the Ten Time World Champ, Going The Distance With Hector Macho Camacho, which was released on December 1, 2021, by Page Publishing. 

==Marriage and family==
Camacho had four sons, his oldest from an early relationship and three from his marriage. His eldest son, Héctor &quot;Machito&quot; Camacho Jr. (born 1978 in New York, when Camacho was 16), also became a professional boxer and has won a championship.

Camacho married Amy Torres in 1991, and they had three sons: Justin (born December 1, 1989), Christian (born 1992), and Tyler Camacho (born 1998). (The &quot;New York Times&quot; reports the youngest son&#x27;s name as &quot;Taylor&quot;.) In 1998 she obtained a restraining order against Camacho, alleging he had threatened her and one of their sons. They divorced in 2001. In March 2011, his ex-wife Amy Camacho and at least one son were living in Orange County, Florida when an argument between the boxer and his ex-wife caused neighbors to become alarmed and call police. His youngest son, Tyler, is also a boxer, as was his brother, Felix Camacho.

Together for 15 years, Hector was engaged to Shelly Salemassi. In 2003, The Press and Guide of Dearborn, Michigan printed an engagement notice between Camacho and Shelly Salemassi, along with a photograph of the couple. Although they never married, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported she was the only one of his former significant others to fly to Camacho&#x27;s New York funeral.

==Popular influence==
During the peak of his career, Camacho became an icon in popular culture. He first appeared on Telemundo&#x27;s &quot;Super Sábados&quot;, where he joined a musical sketch, &quot;Macho Time&quot;, named after his catchphrase. During the 1990s, Camacho appeared in episodes of &quot;El Show del Mediodía&quot;, performing staged fights with Melwin Cedeño&#x27;s character, Chevy, el Ponzoñú.

In 1992, Camacho invited Cedeño to sing a version with him of &quot;La Borinqueña&quot; before a fight, together with Pedro Guzmán, a fellow comedian/musician. The trio&#x27;s publicity stunt drew strong criticism at the time. Camacho also appeared in the sitcom, &quot;The Wayans Bros.,&quot; portraying Manuel &quot;Hot Pepper&quot; López. He staged a fight against the main character, Marlon &quot;Suckerpunch&quot; Williams (Marlon Wayans).

Due to his prominence, Camacho became the subject of cultural references in television, music and literature. Harry Mullan devoted a chapter to him, titled &quot;It&#x27;s Macho Time,&quot; in his &quot;The Book of Boxing Quotations&quot; (1988). In a 2003 episode of &quot;King of the Hill,&quot; titled &quot;Boxing Luanne&quot;, the titular character Hank Hill remarks &quot;Oh, I get it. A little flash… Like Héctor &quot;Macho&quot; Camacho&quot;. after placing tassels in the boxing outfit of Luanne Platter. Rapper Lil Wayne referred to Camacho and the professional wrestler &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage in his 2008 single, &quot;Mr. Carter&quot;.

Following retirement, Camacho expanded his role as a television personality. In 2010, he took part in &quot;¡Mira Quien Baila!&quot;, a reality show that is the American/Spanish-Speaking version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He was the first to be eliminated from the competition. Camacho later joined the Univision entertainment news program &quot;El Gordo y La Flaca&quot; as a &quot;Mira Quien Baila&quot; critic and entertainment world newscaster. In March 2012, Camacho starred on a dating game show titled &quot;It&#x27;s Macho Time,&quot; where women competed to be his &quot;girlfriend&quot;. Currently a written biography is being assembled by Emil &quot;Rocco&quot; Filerino, a lifelong friend and personal manager. Another biography, &quot;Macho Time: The Meteoric Rise and Tragic Fall of Hector Camacho&quot;, by writer Christian Giudice, was published on October 20, 2020. In addition to those books, his son Hector Camacho Jr. wrote a collaboration with author Dustin Warburton and illustrator Dan Monroe, a comic book named &quot;Macho Dad&quot; in which Camacho is portrayed as a son-carrying, Puerto Rican flag-wearing superhero. Macho Dad was released on September 1, 2014.
Hector&#x27;s fiancée, Shelly Salemassi, published a book of their real life story called &quot;The Lady and the Ten Time World Champ, Going The Distance With Hector Macho Camacho&quot;, which was released on December 1, 2021, by Page Publishing ().

<text>Wellsburg is a city in, and the county seat of, Brooke County, West Virginia, United States. The 2020 census recorded a population of 2,455. It is a part of the Weirton–Steubenville metropolitan area. The city&#x27;s economy includes several telemarketing facilities, and a factory that does metal fabrication and plastics molding.

==History==

The town was laid out in 1790, and its post office was opened on September 1, 1870.

In 1772, the Cox brothers, Friend, Israel, and Jonathan, made tomahawk rights claims totaling in the area now including Wellsburg. In March 1788, Charles Prather purchased from the Cox heirs for $3,000. In 1791, Prather petitioned Ohio County to incorporate the town of Charlestown, Virginia, naming it after himself. The original name continued until 1816, when it was changed to Wellsburg, to avoid confusion with Charles Town, Jefferson County. The new name was in honor of Alexander Wells, Charles Prather&#x27;s son-in-law, builder of the first large flour warehouse in the east. Late in 1890, nearby Midway and Lazearville were annexed to Wellsburg.

Wellsburg was the home of Patrick Gass, the last surviving member of the Lewis and Clark expedition and author of a memoir of the famous journey. Here also was the home of Joseph Doddridge, author of &quot;Notes on the Settlement and Indian Wars&quot;. In 1832, the original Grimes Golden apple tree was found just east of Wellsburg. The first glass factory in Western Virginia was built at Wellsburg in 1813.

Wellsburg has a number of entries on the National Register of Historic Places. The most notable are Miller&#x27;s Tavern and Wellsburg Wharf. The Wellsburg Historic District was listed in 1982.

<text>LOT Polish Airlines, legally incorporated as Polskie Linie Lotnicze LOT [[S.A. (corporation)|S.A.]] (, &quot;flight&quot;), is the flag carrier of Poland. A founding member of IATA, it remains one of the world&#x27;s oldest airlines in operation. With a fleet of 80 aircraft as of August 2024, LOT Polish Airlines is the 18th largest operator in Europe, serving 105 domestic and international destinations across Europe, Asia and North America. The airline was founded on 29 December 1928 by the Polish government during the Second Polish Republic as a self-governing limited liability corporation, taking over existing domestic airlines Aerolot (founded in 1922) and Aero (founded in 1925), and began operations on 1 January 1929.

During the 1930s, LOT expanded its domestic and international routes, leading to a network spanning over 10,250 km by 1939. It also expanded its fleet, acquiring Douglas DC-2 and Lockheed Electra and various other aircraft. The airline moved its operations to the new Warsaw Okęcie Airport in 1934. However, the outbreak of World War II in 1939 led to the suspension of services and evacuation of most of LOT&#x27;s aircraft. Post-war, LOT was reestablished in 1945 as a state enterprise, primarily operating Soviet-built aircraft due to Poland becoming a Soviet satellite state in 1948. Resuming both domestic and international flights, LOT operated a fleet consisting of Ilyushin Il-18, Ilyushin Il-62, Tupolev Tu-134, and Antonov An-24, among others, serving routes across Europe, the Middle East, and eventually launching transatlantic flights to North America in the early 1970s.

In the post-1989 era, following the fall of communism in Poland, LOT transitioned to Western aircraft, including the acquisition of Boeing 767 for long-haul routes. The airline joined the Star Alliance in 2003. In 2012, LOT became the first European operator of Boeing 787 Dreamliner. In recent years, the airline faced a failed privatization attempt and a temporary suspension of operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the destinations originate from its hub at Warsaw Chopin Airport. Since 2018, LOT has maintained one long-haul route from Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport in Hungary where it operates regularly scheduled flights to Seoul all year round.

==History==
===Pre-war LOT of the Second Republic===
When the airline was founded in 1928, Poland&#x27;s State Treasury had 86% of the shares in the line, with the rest belonging to the Province of Silesia and the city of Poznań. At the beginning of the 1930s, in addition to existing services from Warsaw to Kraków, Poznań, Gdańsk and Lwów, new service to Bydgoszcz and Katowice was introduced. In 1932, LOT began flying to Wilno. It was also at this point, in 1931, that LOT&#x27;s well-renowned logo, the &quot;Flying Crane&quot; (designed by a visual artist from Warsaw, Tadeusz Gronowski, and still in use today) was picked as the winning entry of the airline&#x27;s logo design competition.
In the same year, the company&#x27;s first multi-segment international flight along the route Warsaw – Lwów – Czerniowce – Bucharest was launched. In next years there followed services to Berlin, Athens, Helsinki, Budapest, including some waypoints. By 1939 the lines were extended to Beirut, Rome, Copenhagen, reaching of routes. The Douglas DC-2, Lockheed Model 10A Electra and Model 14H Super Electra joined the fleet in 1935, 1936 and 1938 respectively (During this period, LOT had 10 Lockheed 10, 10 Lockheed 14, 3 DC-2 and 1 Ju 52/3mge). Several Polish aircraft designs were tested, but only the single-engined PWS-24 airliner was acquired in any number. In 1934, after five years of operating under the LOT name, the airline received new head offices, technical facilities, hangars, workshops, and warehouses located at the new, modern Warsaw Okęcie Airport. This constituted a move from the airline&#x27;s previous base at Pole Mokotowskie, as this airport had become impossible to operate safely due it gradually becoming absorbed into Warsaw&#x27;s outlying urban and residential areas.
In 1938, LOT changed its name, following the Polish spelling reform of that year from Polskie Linje Lotnicze &#x27;LOT&#x27; to Polskie Linie Lotnicze &#x27;LOT&#x27;. That same year, a well-publicised transatlantic test flight from Los Angeles via Buenos Aires, Natal, Dakar to Warsaw, aimed at judging the feasibility of introducing passenger service on the Poland-United States route, was successfully executed. There were plans to open services to London and Moscow, and even transatlantic service in 1940. The airline had carried 218,000 passengers before the services were suspended after the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939 and during the following German occupation of Poland; most of LOT&#x27;s aircraft were evacuated to Romania, two to Baltic states, and three L-14H to Great Britain. In 1939 there were 697 employees, including 25 pilots, most of which were evacuated along with the planes. 13 airliners that got to Romania were seized by the Romanian government. For the duration of the Second World War, the airline suspended operations.

===LOT during Polish People&#x27;s Republic===
After the Soviet occupation of Poland, from August 1944 until December 1945 the Polish Air Force maintained basic transport in the country; from March 1945 there were regular routes maintained by Civil Aviation Department of the Air Force. On 10 March 1945 the Polish government recreated the LOT airline, as a state-owned enterprise (Przedsiębiorstwo Państwowe Polskie Linie Lotnicze &#x27;LOT&#x27;), which would mainly fly Soviet-built aircraft, owing to the tensions of the Cold War and Poland being a member of the Warsaw Pact. In 1946, seven years after service was first suspended, the airline restarted its operations after receiving ten Soviet-built ex-Air Force Lisunov Li-2Ts, then further passenger Li-2Ps and nine Douglas C-47s. Both domestic and international services restarted that year, first to Berlin, Paris, Stockholm and Prague. In 1947 there were added routes to Bucharest, Budapest, Belgrad and Copenhagen. 
Five modern, although troublesome SE.161 Languedoc joined the fleet for a short period in 1947–1948, followed by five Ilyushin Il-12B in 1949; 13–20 Ilyushin Il-14s then followed in 1955–1957. After the end of Stalinism in Poland, few Western aircraft would be acquired; five Convair 240s in 1957 and three Vickers Viscounts in 1962 proved to be the last until the 1990s. After that, the composition of the airline&#x27;s fleet shifted exclusively to Soviet-produced aircraft. Only in 1955 LOT inaugurated services to Moscow, being the centre of the Marxist–Leninist world, and to Vienna. Services to London and Zürich were not re-established until 1958, and to Rome until 1960.

Nine Ilyushin Il-18 turboprop airliners were introduced in June 1961, leading to the establishment of routes to Africa and the Middle East, and in 1963 LOT expanded its routes to serve Cairo. In the 1970s there were added lines to Baghdad, Beirut, Benghazi, Damascus and Tunis. The Antonov An-24 was delivered from April 1966 (20 used, on domestic routes), followed by the first jet airliners Tupolev Tu-134 in November 1968 (which coincided with the opening of a new international terminal at Warsaw&#x27;s Okęcie Airport). The Tu-134s were operated on European routes. The Ilyushin Il-62 long-range jet airliner inaugurate the first transatlantic routes in the history of Polish air transport to Toronto in 1972 as a charter flight and a regular flight to New York City in 1973. LOT began service on its first Far East destination – Bangkok via Dubai and Bombay in 1977.

In 1977 the airline&#x27;s current livery (despite occasional changes, notably in corporate typography) designed by Roman Duszek and Andrzej Zbrożek, with the large &#x27;LOT&#x27; inscription in blue on the front fuselage, and a blue tailplane was introduced, the 1929-designed Tadeusz Gronowski logo, however, despite many changes in livery, was kept through the years, and to this day remains the same.

In the autumn of 1981, commercial air traffic in Poland neared collapse in the wake of the communist government&#x27;s crackdown on dissenters in the country after the rise of the banned &#x27;trade union&#x27; dissident Solidarity movement, and some Western airlines suspended their flights to Warsaw. With 13 December declaration of Martial Law that same year, all LOT connections were suspended. Charter flights to New York and Chicago resumed only in 1984, and eventually, regular flight connections were restored on 28 April 1985. Tupolev Tu-154 mid-range airliners were acquired, after the withdrawal of Il-18 and Tu-134 aircraft from LOT&#x27;s fleet in the 1980s, and were deployed successively on most European and Middle East routes. In 1986 transatlantic charter flights also reached Detroit and Los Angeles.

===Post-1989 LOT Polish Airlines===
After the fall of the communist system in Poland in 1989 the fleet shifted back to Western aircraft, beginning with acquisitions of the Boeing 767-200 in April 1989, followed by the Boeing 767-300 in March 1990, ATR 72 in August 1991, Boeing 737-500 in December 1992 and finally the Boeing 737-400 in April 1993. From the mid-1980s to early 1990s LOT flew from Warsaw to Chicago, Edmonton, Montreal, Newark, New York City and Toronto. These routes were primarily inaugurated to serve the large Polish communities (Polonia) in North America.

LOT was among the first Central European airlines to operate American aircraft when the Boeing 767 was introduced; the 767s were used to operate LOT&#x27;s longest-ever connection, to Singapore. By the end of 1989 LOT had hosted that year&#x27;s IATA congress and reached a milestone annual load-factor of 2.3 million passengers carried over the year.

In 1990 LOT&#x27;s third Boeing 767-300 landed at Warsaw Chopin Airport and not long after Boeing 737 and ATR 72 aircraft were acquired for use on LOT&#x27;s expanded route network, which began to include new international destinations such as Kyiv, Lviv, Minsk and Vilnius. In 1993, LOT began to expand its Western-European operations, inaugurating, in quick succession, flights to Oslo, Frankfurt and Düsseldorf; operations at Poland&#x27;s other regional airports outside Warsaw were also duly expanded around this time.

In 1994 the airline signed a codesharing agreement with American Airlines on flights to and from Warsaw as well as onward flights in the United States and Poland operated by both companies; flights to Thessaloniki, Zagreb and Nice were inaugurated, and according to an IATA report, in this year LOT had the youngest fleet of any airline in the world. After years of planning, in 1997 LOT set up a sister airline, EuroLOT, which, essentially operating as its parent airline&#x27;s regional subsidiary, took over domestic flights. The airline was developed with the hope that it would increase transit passenger-flow through Warsaw&#x27;s Chopin Airport, whilst at the same time providing capacity on routes with smaller load factors and play a part in developing LOT&#x27;s reputation as the largest transit airline in Central and Eastern Europe. By 1999 LOT had purchased a number of small Embraer 145 regional jets in order to expand its short-haul fleet, and had, with the approval of the Minister of the State Treasury, begun a process of selling shares to the Swiss company SAirGroup Holding; this then led to the airline&#x27;s incorporation into the then-nascent Qualiflyer Group.

Expansion of LOT&#x27;s route network continued in the early 2000s and the potential of the airline&#x27;s hub at Warsaw Chopin Airport to become a major transit airport was realised . In 2000 LOT took delivery of its largest-ever order of 11 aircraft, and by 2001 it had reached a milestone passengers-carried figure of 3 million customers in one year; the expansion led to the reconstruction of much of LOT&#x27;s ground infrastructure, and by 2002 a new central Warsaw head office was opened on Ul. 17 Stycznia. On 26 October 2003, LOT, after the collapse of the Qualiflyer Group, became the 14th member of the Star Alliance. By 2006 a new base of operations, with the reconstruction of Warsaw Chopin Airport, had opened, thus allowing LOT&#x27;s full transit airline potential to be developed for the first time. The new airport was much larger than any previous airport in Poland. In that same year, Pope Benedict XVI returned to Rome on a LOT flight following his pilgrimage to Poland.

LOT created low-cost arm Centralwings in 2004; however, the company was dissolved and reincorporated into LOT after just five years of operating due to its long-term unprofitability and LOT&#x27;s wish to redeploy aircraft within its fleet.

===2008–2019===
In 2008, LOT opened a new flight to Beijing, but this lasted just one month, in the period before the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The reason given by the airline for the discontinuation of the service was the need to route aircraft via an air corridor to the south of Kazakhstan (as LOT did not have permission for flights over Siberia from the Russian government), which was making the services too long and thus unprofitable.

LOT started new services to Yerevan, Armenia, Beirut, Lebanon, and resumed Tallinn, Estonia, Kaliningrad, Russia, Gothenburg, Sweden, and Bratislava, Slovakia with its newly acquired Embraer aircraft in the summer of 2010. In October of the same year LOT resumed service to Asia, with three weekly flights on the Warsaw – Hanoi route. In addition to this, new services to Tbilisi, Damascus, and Cairo were inaugurated.

In 2010 LOT cancelled flights, after 14 years of operation, between Kraków and the US destinations of Chicago and New York City, citing profitability concerns and lack of demand. The last US-Kraków flight departed on 27 October 2010 from Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport. The aircraft previously used on this route were then re-deployed to serve LOT&#x27;s Warsaw-Hanoi route. This route to Hanoi (the Vietnamese capital) was largely under-utilised by European carriers and proved very successful for LOT in the beginning.

On 31 May 2010, CEO of LOT Sebastian Mikosz said that the airline would be replacing its fleet to meet a goal of one-third new by 2011. Replacement already started with Embraer E-Jets 175/170. For domestic expanded operations, LOT purchased Dash 8-Q400 over ATR 72-600 aircraft.

On 5 February 2011, the new CEO of LOT, Marcin Piróg, announced that the airline was considering opening services to Baku, Sochi, Stuttgart, Oslo, Gothenburg, Dubai, Kuwait, and Ostrava from its Warsaw hub in the near future. Previously planned flights to Donetsk in Ukraine had already been inaugurated, as had Tokyo, and the resumption of Beijing flights. This became feasible after the finalizing of an agreement on Siberian overflight permits for LOT by the Polish and Russian governments in November 2011. As a result of the agreement, LOT received new take-off and landing slots at Moscow&#x27;s Sheremetyevo International Airport. Although delayed from the original plans, LOT began flights to Tokyo on 13 January 2016, with flights three times per week.

In 2010/11 LOT announced its new &#x27;East meets West&#x27; route expansion policy, which saw the airline add several new Asian destinations to its schedule over the coming years. The policy aimed to take advantage of LOT&#x27;s perspective as a transit airline and the substantial passenger growth seen on Europe-Asia flights in recent years. Also, in line with this policy LOT introduced premium economy class on all Boeing 787 aircraft. Additionally, lie-flat seats were made available in business class, and all of the airline&#x27;s new long-haul aircraft were fitted with Thales personal entertainment systems.
In June 2012, LOT announced all services to New York would be centralized from Newark and JFK Terminal 4 to JFK Terminal 1 from October 2012. It would also enter into a codeshare agreement with JetBlue to increase the number of onward connections available to its customers.
In July 2012 it was announced that a planned sale of a major stake in the airline to Turkish Airlines would not go ahead. The main problem was the inability of Turkish Airlines to own a majority stake, inasmuch as it is not a European Union company.

On 21 June 2015, 1,400 of the airline&#x27;s passengers were affected as 22 of its flights were impacted after hackers attacked airline computers that were issuing flight plans at Warsaw&#x27;s Okecie airport. LOT spokesman Adrian Kubicki said: &quot;We&#x27;re using state-of-the-art computer systems, so this could potentially be a threat to others in the industry.&quot;

Amidst a restructuring plan which saw the airline return to profitability for the first time in seven years, a 22 June 2015 press conference revealed details about the airline&#x27;s prospects. These included reinstating routes renounced as part of EU sanctions imposed following Polish government aid granted to ensure the airline&#x27;s survival, as well as new long haul routes to Asia and North America.

Air Lease Corporation confirmed on 13 October 2016, the placement of six Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft with LOT, and options to lease five further aircraft of the same type. Long haul plans saw the addition of further Boeing 787 aircraft, increasing the total to 16. The airline was evaluating the economics of future narrow body and wide body acquisitions to broaden expansion initiatives. The airline&#x27;s CEO said that they were evaluating the Airbus A220 and Embraer E-Jet-E2 families, as well as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 XWB offerings.

In May 2018, LOT Polish Airlines started scheduled flights from outside Poland beginning with long-haul routes to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City and O&#x27;Hare International Airport in Chicago from Budapest airport in Hungary. In May 2019, it started flying from Lithuanian capital Vilnius to London City airport, and from Estonian capital Tallinn to Brussels and Stockholm two months later. The latter two flights were suspended in early 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

In December 2018, LOT was ranked the quietest among 50 airlines that regularly fly to Heathrow Airport in London. LOT spokesman Adrian Kubicki attributed the result to modern Boeing 737 MAX 8s with modern CFM International engines being used, and to the airline&#x27;s pilots’ precise landing technique using the continuous descent approach (CDA) procedure.

===Recent developments since 2020===
On 24 January 2020, the owner of LOT, the Polish Aviation Group (Polska Grupa Lotnicza or PGL) announced that it would acquire Condor Flugdienst. On 2 April 2020 it was announced that the sale had fallen through.

The company temporarily suspended operations on 15 March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and domestic Polish flights restarted only on 1 June 2020, while international flights were resumed on a very limited basis from 1 July 2020. LOT Polish Airlines recorded a net loss of US$365.2 million in 2020, with a loss in sales of $138.1 million.

The airline posted a gross profit of $28 million for 2022, and a net profit of $276 million for 2023.

In February 2025, LOT announced it would end long-haul operations from Budapest, Hungary, from where it currently serves a single route to Seoul by March 2025. This leaves all of their long-haul operations at Polish airports.

==Corporate affairs==
===Privatisation===
Currently, the airline is wholly owned by Polish Aviation Group (Polish: &quot;Polska Grupa Lotnicza S. A.&quot;), a Polish state-owned holding company.

LOT was intended to be privatised in 2011. Although advanced talks were undertaken with Turkish Airlines a deal failed to materialise. This was largely due to the inability of Turkish Airlines, as a non-EU airline, to buy a majority of the airline. LOT lost 145.5 million złoty (PLN) in 2011, compared to a 163.1 million PLN loss in 2010.

LOT saw a return to profitability in 2016, with profits of 183.5 million and more than 280 million PLN respectively. The profits led the then finance minister Mateusz Morawiecki to suggest they were a result of his government&#x27;s policies. He also accused the previous Civic Platform government of leading the airline to either bankruptcy or &quot;accelerated privatisation&quot;.

===Subsidiaries===
;Current subsidiaries
* LOT Charters, wholly owned subsidiary operating charter flights for Polish tour operators
* LOT Flight Academy

;Former subsidiaries
* Nordica, 49% stake was owned by LOT between 2016 and 2020.
* EuroLOT, a formerly wholly owned subsidiary airline, founded on 1 July 1997. The Polish Treasury owned 62.1 percent while LOT retained 37.9 percent. However, it was confirmed in July 2012 that LOT wished to sell its remaining stake in EuroLOT, as part of its privatization scheme. However, on 6 February 2015, the decision was taken to liquidate the airline and transfer the majority of its fleet to LOT. 
* Centralwings, a low-cost subsidiary that was operational between 2004 and 2009

===Historic fleet===

===Fleet development===
* On 7 September 2005, the airline ordered seven Boeing 787-8s (with two options and five purchase rights) for its long-haul operations. On 19 February 2007 the airline converted one option to make a total of eight 787s on order. On 7 March 2011 Boeing officially notified LOT Polish Airlines that the delivery of the 787 would be delayed for another year. The airline planned to use the 787 on its Warsaw-Chicago route on 16 January 2013, but the type was grounded on that same day due to issues with its batteries. On 25 April 2013, LOT announced that it would resume its 787 services on 5 June 2013.
* On 4 May 2010, LOT converted four Embraer E-175 orders to Embraer E-195 orders. The delivery of these aircraft began in March 2011.
* On 8 June 2010, the Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Poland leased two E175 aircraft from LOT to transport senior government officials on short/medium-haul flights until the end of 2018.
* In 2016 the airline signed contracts for eleven leased Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft (six firm commitments and five options), with deliveries starting in late 2017.
* On 24 April 2018, LOT announced the purchase of three additional Boeing 787-9 aircraft, bringing the total of the −9 variant to seven of the fifteen Boeing 787s expected to be in the fleet by October 2019.
* On 15 July 2022, LOT announced that they are favoring the Airbus A220 as opposed to the Embraer E-Jet E2 family to replace its current aging Embraer Regional Jet fleet, with a 60 jet order valuing US$2.1 Billion.
* On 8 May 2024, LOT announced order for three brand new Embraer E-195 E2 jets. The delivery began in July 2024.

==Corporate identity==
With the delivery of new Boeing 787 long-haul aircraft in 2011/12, LOT introduced a new livery. This design was intended to retain the tradition and spirit of LOT with no major or radical changes to the livery applied to the airline&#x27;s aircraft. The blue nose and broad cheat-line were removed; the &#x27;POLSKIE LINIE LOTNICZE&#x27; title on each aircraft&#x27;s starboard side was replaced with the words &#x27;POLISH AIRLINES&#x27;. The tailplane&#x27;s design was changed only slightly, with the colours of the traditional encircled crane logo being inverted and the circle becoming a more simple outline ring.

Several Embraer aircraft have special advertising liveries, while one E-175 was repainted as a retrojet into the 1945 livery that was used with some modifications until the 1970s.

===Livery 1935–1939, 1945–1956===
Airliners featured all-natural metal silvery color, with a black crane logo on the tail, and a small black inscription: POLSKIE LINIE LOTNICZE „LOT&quot; under or above the window line. Before 1939, there was also a rounded inscription: LOT above passenger doors (apart from Ju 52, which also differed in having black engine covers and nacelles).

After World War II, the aircraft mostly wore a similar all-natural metal scheme, with the airline name above the window line. In the late 1940s, the Polish white and red flag was added on a rudder. From the early 1950s, a thin blue cheatline was introduced below the window line, starting with a stylized bird in front. Some aircraft flew in military schemes (green and light blue or olive drab and grey).

===Livery 1956–1976===
This livery featured blue mid-level broad cheatline on the window line, with the fuselage a white colour above the cheatline and unpainted below. Early versions of this livery also featured thin blue stripes above and below the cheatline and a white tail, with small black crane logo on the fin and medium-size Polish flag on the rudder. Above the cheatline there was black inscription in italics: &quot;POLSKIE LINIE LOTNICZE »LOT«&quot;. There was also a long black stylized crane below the cockpit on most aircraft. In the early 1960s, the scheme was modernized and featured the blue cheatline without upper and lower stripes, and a blue tail fin and rudder. The Polish flag was much larger on the tail, while the crane logo was above the flag, on a white circle. There was also another Polish flag on the cheatline, behind the cockpit. On Il-18s and Il-62s, the cheatline was narrower, below the window line.

===Livery 1977–2010s===
LOT&#x27;s iconic livery was introduced in 1977 and has undergone no major changes. The livery is essentially a predominantly white scheme with elements of traditional aviation design incorporated. The latter elements were visible in the design of the LOT livery as an area of dark blue under the cockpit windscreen, the long cheat-line painted down the side of the fuselage and the large traditional logo which is emblazoned on the tailplane.

===Aircraft naming===
Ilyushin Il-62 aircraft were named after famous Polish people, with the first-named &quot;Mikołaj Kopernik&quot;. The five Boeing 767s LOT ordered from Boeing were named after Polish cities. The used and short term leased 767s LOT operated did not get names. This practise was not continued upon arrival of LOT&#x27;s Boeing 787s and the introduction of the airline&#x27;s updated livery. Only LOT&#x27;s sixth 787, SP-LRF, was named &#x27;Franek&#x27; after an online vote organised by the airline.

* On 1 November 2011 a Boeing 767-300ER (registered SP-LPC) operating as Flight 16 from Newark Liberty International Airport to Warsaw Chopin Airport reported the failure of the hydraulic system that operated the flaps and landing gear. When the backup system was activated, only the flaps were operable. All attempts to lower the landing gear failed, including one last attempt using gravity; forcing a gear-up landing on runway 33 at Warsaw Chopin, which is exceptionally rare for modern airliners to do. The aircraft, captained by Tadeusz Wrona, managed to make a successful gear-up landing with no injuries or fatalities. The aircraft was written off, and runway 15/33 at Chopin Airport was shut for some time to repair the damage sustained on the runway, including some lights that were destroyed when the aircraft slid over them.
* On 10 January 2018 a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 (SP-EQG) operating as LO3924 from Krakow to Warsaw reported landing gear issues. Warsaw Chopin Airport was shut down for four hours after an emergency landing there around 19:30 local time with a failed nose gear. There were no reported injuries to the 59 passengers on board.

===Communist-era hijacking asylum attempts===
During the Cold War, when Europe was divided by the Iron Curtain, several LOT aircraft were hijacked and forced to land in a Western country, predominantly in West Germany and especially in West Berlin, because of it being situated like an island in the Eastern Bloc. The hijackers were usually not prosecuted there but could claim political asylum, along with all other passengers who wished to do so.
* On 16 September 1949, five armed people forced a LOT flight from Gdańsk to Łódź to divert to Nyköping in Sweden.
* On 16 December of the same year, another aircraft on the same route was hijacked, this time it diverted to Bornholm Airport in Denmark. Of the 15 passengers and three crew members on board, 16 decided to claim political asylum.
* On 16 October 1969, a LOT Antonov An-24 (registered SP-LTK) was hijacked by two passengers en route a flight from Warsaw to East Berlin and forced to divert to Berlin Tegel Airport, serving West Berlin.
* Another hijacking of a LOT An-24 occurred on 20 November of the same year, this time on a flight from Wrocław to Bratislava, when two passengers forced the pilots to land at Vienna International Airport.
* On 5 June 1970, a LOT An-24 with 24 people on board was hijacked during a flight from Szczecin to Gdańsk and forced to land at Copenhagen Airport in Denmark, where police forces stormed the aircraft and arrested the perpetrator. 
* On 9 June 1970, another hijacking attempt occurred on a LOT flight from Katowice to Warsaw, but the two persons involved were overpowered.
* On 7 August 1970, one passenger on board a LOT An-24 flying from Szczecin to Katowice forced the pilots to divert to Germany. As he did not specify his demands any further, the aircraft landed at Berlin Schönefeld Airport in East Germany, where he was arrested.
* On 19 August 1970, five passengers on board a LOT Ilyushin Il-14 en route a scheduled flight from Gdańsk to Warsaw forced the pilots to divert to Bornholm Airport in Denmark.
* On 26 August 1970, three persons on board a LOT An-24 on a flight from Katowice to Warsaw demanded to be taken to Austria. The pilots returned the aircraft to Katowice Airport instead, where the perpetrators were arrested.
* On 4 November 1976, a LOT Tupolev Tu-134 (registered SP-LHD) was forced by two passengers to leave its scheduled route from Copenhagen to Warsaw and land at Vienna International Airport instead, where they surrendered to local police forces.
* On 24 April 1977 another LOT Tu-134 (registered SP-LGA) was hijacked, this time on a flight from Kraków to Nuremberg in West Germany. The pilots returned to Kraków-Balice Airport, where the aircraft was stormed and the hijacker arrested. 
* Another hijacking attempt was suppressed on 18 October 1977 on board a LOT An-24 (registered SP-LTH) en route from Katowice to Warsaw.
* On 30 August 1978, Flight 165 en route from Gdańsk to East Berlin was hijacked by two East German citizens who forced the pilots to land the Tu-134 involved (registered SP-LGC) at Berlin Tempelhof Airport in West Berlin. Apart from the hijackers, another six people decided to claim political asylum, thus making it one of the largest successful escapes over the Berlin Wall.
* On 4 December 1980, a LOT An-24 (registered SP-LTB) was hijacked during a flight from Zielona Góra to Warsaw and forced to land at Berlin-Tegel Airport. 
* SP-LTB was involved in another hijacking attempt on 10 January 1981, when four passengers demanded to be taken to a Western country during a flight from Katowice to Warsaw. This time, the pilots continued to Warsaw-Okecie Airport, though, where the perpetrators were arrested.
* An Antonov An-24 (registered SP-LTI) was forced to land at Tempelhof Airport in West Berlin on 21 July 1981, after having been hijacked during a flight from Katowice to Gdańsk. 
* On 5 August 1981, another hijacking attempt occurred on board SP-LTI while it was flying from Katowice to Gdańsk, but the perpetrator was restrained and arrested upon landing at Gdańsk Airport. 
* On 11 August, another hijacking attempt on the Katowice to Gdańsk route was foiled, again on an Antonov An-24 (registered SP-LTT).
* On 22 August 1981, a hijacker succeeded in his demands that the aircraft involved (an An-24 registered SP-LTC) be diverted to West Berlin&#x27;s Tegel Airport from its original route from Wrocław to Warsaw. 
* On 18 September 1981 twelve passengers rioted on board an Antonov An-24 (registered SP-LTG) on a flight from Katowice to Warsaw and demanded the aircraft be diverted to West Berlin. A Mil Mi-8 helicopter of the Soviet military tried to intercept the aircraft before landing at Tegel Airport, but failed to do so. 
* On 22 September four passengers tried to hijack a LOT flight from Warsaw to Koszalin, but the pilots returned the An-24 (registered SP-LTK) to Warsaw-Okecie Airport instead, where the perpetrators were arrested. 
* A week later on 29 September 1981, one hijacker demanded an Antonov An-12 (registered SP-LTP) on a flight from Warsaw to Szczecin be diverted to West Berlin; again the pilots landed the aircraft in Warsaw.
* On 30 April 1982, eight passengers forced a LOT An-24 (registered SP-LTG), that was operating a flight from Wrocław to Warsaw, to divert to Berlin-Tegel Airport.
* On 9 June 1982, two hijackers on board a LOT flight from Katowice to Warsaw demanded the pilots to divert to West Germany. Instead, the aircraft landed in Poland and the perpetrators were arrested.
* On 25 August 1982, two passengers forced the LOT flight from Budapest to Warsaw, that was operated using an Ilyushin Il-18 (registered SP-LSI) to divert to Munich Riem Airport. 
* On 22 November 1982 the flight from Wrocław to Warsaw (operated by an An-24 registered SP-LTK) was forced to land at Berlin-Tempelhof Airport.

===Other===
* On 25 February 1993, a man forced his way into a LOT ATR 72 (registered SP-LFA) at Rzeszów-Jasionka Airport during the boarding process for Flight 702 to Warsaw, threatening to detonate a hand grenade. Police special forces stormed the aircraft in which there was a total number 30 of people at the time of the assault. The perpetrator (who proved to be unarmed) was shot at and overpowered.

<text>Burgas (, ), sometimes transliterated as Bourgas, is the second largest city on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast in the region of Northern Thrace and the fourth-largest city in Bulgaria after Sofia, Plovdiv, and Varna, with a population of 210,284 inhabitants, while 219,747 live in its urban area. It is the capital of Burgas Province and an important industrial, transport, cultural and tourist centre.

The city is surrounded by the Burgas Lakes and located at the westernmost point of the Black Sea, at the large Burgas Bay.

The Port of Burgas is the largest port in Bulgaria, and Burgas Airport is the second most important in the country. Burgas is the centre of the Bulgarian fishing and fish processing industry.

== Names ==

The city&#x27;s name is similar to Burgos in Spain, as well as numerous cities containing the Germanic &#x27;burg&#x27; suffix, meaning &quot;city,&quot;
such as Hamburg.
It is widely considered, including by the city&#x27;s official website, that the name of the city is derived from the Latin word &quot;burgus&quot;, meaning a &quot;tower&quot;, after a local ancient Roman travel post, which used to be in the area of today&#x27;s Burgas Port. Fifteen centuries later, the settlement was mentioned by the Byzantine poet Manuel Philes as &quot;Pyrgos&quot; (Greek: Πύργος), a word identical in meaning with the Greek word for tower. The name passed to Bulgarian through the Turkish &quot;Burgaz&quot;.
There are several alternative explanations for the name&#x27;s origin. One of them states the city&#x27;s name comes from Gothic name &quot;baurgs&quot;, meaning &quot;signified consolidated walled villages&quot;. According to Bulgarian prof. Kiril Vlahov, the name of the city comes from the Thracian word &quot;pyurg&quot;, meaning &quot;fortification of wooden beams&quot;.

==Geography==

=== Topography ===
Burgas is situated at the westernmost point of the bay by the same name and in the eastern part of the Burgas Plain, in the east of the Upper Thracian Plain. Burgas is located some from Sofia, from Plovdiv, from Varna, and from Istanbul. To the west, south and north, the city is surrounded by the Burgas Lakes: Burgas, Atanasovsko, and Mandrensko, which are home to several hundred bird species. Pan-European corridor 8 passes through the city, the European routes E87 and E773, and the longest national rout I/6. The St. Anastasia Island is a part of the city.

===Climate===

Under the Köppen climate classification, Burgas has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;). The summertime in Burgas lasts about five months from mid-May until late September. Average temperatures during high season is . Summertime sea temperatures stay around at sunrise and go up to by dusk, averaging . Winters are milder compared with the inland part of the country, with average temperatures of and below during the night. Snow is possible in December, January, February and rarely in March; however, it can quickly melt. The highest temperature was recorded in June 2007, at and the lowest at in January 1942.

=== Flora and fauna ===

The Burgas Wetlands are highly recognized for their significance to biodiversity and as a resource pool for products used by people.

Lake Burgas is Bulgaria&#x27;s largest lake and is in the middle of the city. It is important for migrating birds. Over 250 species of birds inhabit the lake area, 61 of which are endangered in Bulgaria and 9 globally, attracting keen birdwatchers from all over the world. The lakes are also home to important fish and invertebrates. In the site have been recorded several IUCN Red-Listed species of animals – 5 invertebrates, 4 fish, 4 amphibians, 3 reptiles, 5 birds and 3 mammals. Situated along the second largest migration path of birds in Europe, the Via Pontica, the site is an important stopover and staging site for a large number of water-birds, raptors and passerines. Yearly during migration and wintering more than 20,000 (up to 100,000) waterbirds congregate there.

The Atanasovo Lake is one of two salt-water lakes in the Black Sea region and contains rare and representative examples of wetland habitats. It is a hot spot for biodiversity, with many Red-Listed species of plants and animals. It is a well-known bottleneck site for migratory birds, with around 60,000 raptors and 240,000 storks, pelicans and cranes passing over the site and often landing in large numbers for staging. The highest numbers in Europe of migrating Great white pelican (&quot;Pelecanus onocrotalus&quot;), Dalmatian pelican (&quot;Pelecanus crispus&quot;), Western marsh harrier (&quot;Circus aeruginosus&quot;) and Red-footed Falcon (&quot;Falco vespertinus&quot;) have been recorded here.

===Administrative division===
Burgas is divided into the following neighbourhoods:
With a decision from the Counsel of Ministers in 2009, the villages of Banevo and Vetren were incorporated into Burgas.

Currently a new city plan is being considered which will open the city to the sea and includes several residential neighbourhoods and a new highway junction.

==History==

The earliest signs of life in the region date back 3000 years, to the Bronze Age and the early Iron Age. The favorable conditions on the fertile plain, around the sea, have brought people here from early antiquity. The biggest mark was left by the Thracians who made the region rich in archaeological finds (from around 4th c. BC). This includes their sanctuary at Beglik Tash along the south coast and a burial mound near Sunny Beach. They built the mineral baths of Aquae Calidae and the fortress &quot;Tyrsis&quot;.
Under Darius I, it became part of the Achaemenid Empire, before the Odrysian kingdom was established. Greeks from Apollonia built a marketplace to trade with the Thracians, in what is now the neighborhood of Pobeda.

During the rule of the Ancient Romans, near Burgas, &quot;Colonia Flavia Pacis Deultensium&quot; (&quot;Deultum&quot;, &quot;Dibaltum&quot;, or &quot;Develtum&quot;) was established as a military colony for veterans by Vespasian in AD 70. The Romans built this &quot;colonia&quot; on the main road Via Pontica. It was the second most important city in the province Haemimontus.

In 376 the Goths destroyed an elite Roman company near Develtum at the Battle of Dibaltum.

=== Bulgarian and Byzantine Middle Ages ===
In the Middle Ages, there were important settlements in the area: the fortress &quot;Skafida&quot;, &quot;Poros&quot;, &quot;Rusokastron&quot; (Battle of Rusokastro), the Baths called Aquae Calidae and used by Byzantine, Bulgarian and Ottoman Emperors; a small fortress called &quot;Pyrgos&quot; was erected where Burgas is today and was most probably used as a watchtower. Under the Byzantine Empire it became an important city on the Black Sea coast. The Bulgarian ruler Krum built the Erkesiya, a -long border wall from the Black Sea (near Gorno Ezerovo) to the Maritsa River.

In 1206, the Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders (see Fourth Crusade) destroyed Aquae Calidae, which was known as Thermopolis at this time, The baths were later rebuilt by the Byzantines and Bulgarians. Poros was mentioned in a 1270 document of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Close to Poros took place the Battle of Skafida in 1304, when the Bulgarian Tsar Todor Svetoslav defeated the Byzantines and conquered the southern Black Sea coast.

At the beginning of the 14th century, the region was sacked by the Catalan Company. In the 13th century Burgas is mentioned by the Byzantine poet Manuel Philes in his works as &quot;Burgas&quot;.

=== Ottoman rule ===

Like many of the towns surrounding it, Burgas was conquered by the Ottomans with the rest of Bulgaria in the late 14th century, only to be returned to the Byzantine Empire during the Ottoman Interregnum and retained by the Byzantines until the fall of the Empire to the Ottomans in 1453. It was only in the 17th century that a settlement renamed to &quot;Ahelo-Pirgas&quot; grew in the modern area of the city. It was later renamed to &quot;Burgas&quot; again and had only about 3,000 inhabitants. In the early 19th century Burgas was depopulated after raids by &quot;kurzdhali&quot; bandits. By the mid-19th century it had recovered its economic prominence through the growth of craftsmanship and the export of grain. The city was a small town in İslimye (Sliven) sanjak in at first Rumelia Eyalet, after that in the Silistra Eyalet and Edirne Eyalet before the liberation in 1878.

In the 17th and 18th centuries Burgas became an important port for cereal and possesses its own grain measure, the &quot;Burgas-Kile&quot;. The town was the regional centre of trade and administrative centre of the Burgas Kaaza.

In 1865 the port of Burgas was after Trapezunt the second most important Ottoman port in the Black Sea. Burgas was at this time the major centre on the southern Bulgarian Black Sea Coast.

=== From liberation to 1945 ===

It was a department centre in Eastern Rumelia before incorporated in the Principality of Bulgaria in 1885.
From the late 19th century Burgas became an important economic and industry center. The first development plan of the city was adopted in 1891 and the city&#x27;s layout and appearance changed, especially through the newly constructed public buildings. In 1888, the city library was founded, in 1891 the sea garden was created and in 1897 the Cathedral of the Holy brothers Cyril and Methodius was built. In 1895 Georgi Ivanov opened the first Printing house in Burgas, followed by the house of &quot;Christo Velchev&quot; in 1897, which changed in 1900 his name in &quot;Velchevi Brothers Printing house&quot;.

The opening of the railway line to Plovdiv on 27 May 1890 and the deep water port in 1903 were important stages of this boom and led to the rapid industrialization of the city. In the period after 151 factories were founded. Among them were the &quot;Sugar refinery&quot; founded by Avram Chaliovski, the &quot;Great Bulgarian Mills&quot; of Ivan Chadzipetrov and the oil and soap factory &quot;Kambana&quot;. In 1900 the mineral springs by the ancient Aquae Calidae were included in the urban area. In 1903, the new building of the Burgas Central railway station opened.

Founded in 1924 in Burgas &quot;Deweko&quot; (now HemusMark AD) was the first pencil factory in Southeastern Europe and became in 1937 official supplier to the Bulgarian Monarchy. 1925 opened in Burgas a specialized high school for mechanics and technologies. The following year, a large covered market was opened. Because of the cold wave in winter 1928/29 the Black Sea iced in late January and early February, so that the island of Sveta Anastasia could be reached on foot. 1934, Burgas already had 34,260 inhabitants.

=== Communism ===
During World War II on 9 September 1944 Red Army troops occupied the city and soon the whole country. In the following People&#x27;s Courts, especially members of the wealthy families of the intelligentsia and members of the Bar Association were convicted. The two Chambers of the People&#x27;s Courts met in Burgas in the former building of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Burgas (now the seat of the Governor of the Province Burgas).

After the Communists took power in 1945, the German and Italian School and the People&#x27;s University were closed&lt;ref name=&quot;Burneva/Murdsheva&quot;&gt;Burneva/Murdsheva: &quot;Deutsch als Fremdsprache(n) an bulgarischen Hochschulen&quot; in Hiltraud Casper-Hehne: &quot;Die Neustrukturierung von Studiengängen &quot;Deutsch als Fremdsprache&quot;: Probleme und Perspektiven; Fachtagung 17. - 19. November an der Universität Hannover&quot;, Universitätsverlag Göttingen, 2006, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; and over 160 factories and businesses (including the large companies &quot;Great Bulgarian Mills&quot;, &quot;Veriga&quot;, &quot;Plug&quot;, &quot;Dab&quot;, etc.), shops, baths and other private property were nationalized. The nationalization and inability to lead by the new rulers led the companies to the collapse of the food supply and the shortage of goods of daily life in the city. The political repression against the population of Burgas continued for the next few years. Access to universities and other higher education in the Bulgarian capital was refused for the young people of Burgas and some of them were interned in prison and labor camps.

After the end of the Second World War, the Haganah organised several convoys for the European survivors of the Holocaust, which departed on ships from Burgas for Palestine. These convoys allowed 12,000 people, including the Jewish population of the city, to emigrate. In the following years the city center of Burgas, unlike many other Bulgarian cities, was not much affected by Communist-type urbanization and has kept much of its 19th- and early-20th-century architecture. A number of oil and chemical companies were gradually built.

The terrorists of the 2 June Movement, Till Meyer, Gabriele Rollnik, Gudrun Stürmer and Angelika Goder were arrested on 21 June 1978 in Burgas by West German officials and then brought into the Federal Republic.

=== Post 1990 ===
Today the local port is the largest in Bulgaria adding significantly to the regional economy. Burgas also hosts annual national exhibitions and international festivals and has a vibrant student population of over 6,000 that add to the city&#x27;s appeal. The historical society also maintains open-air museums at Beglik Tash and Develtum.

Several countries have General Consulates in Burgas, among them Belarus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Romania, Russia, Sierra Leone, Turkey and Ukraine.

In 2023 Bulgaria took back the concession it had granted to Lukoil in 2011 to run the Rosenets oil terminal. 

==== 2012 bus bombing ====

On 18 July 2012 a terrorist attack was carried out by a suicide bomber on a passenger bus transporting Israeli tourists at the Burgas Airport. The bus was carrying forty-two Israelis, mainly youths, from the airport to their hotels, after arriving on a flight from Tel Aviv. The explosion killed the Bulgarian bus driver and five Israelis.

<text>The biggest Terekeme of the past into discrete, quantified named blocks of time is called periodization. This is a list of such named time periods as defined in various fields of study.

These can be divided broadly into prehistorical periods and historical periods
(when written records began to be kept). 

In archaeology and anthropology, prehistory is subdivided into the three-age system, this list includes the use of the three-age system as well as a number of various designation used in reference to sub-ages within the traditional three.

The dates for each age can vary by region. On the geologic time scale, the Holocene epoch starts at the end of the last glacial period of the current ice age (c. 10,000 BC) and continues to the present. The beginning of the Mesolithic is usually considered to correspond to the beginning of the Holocene epoch.

==General periods==

* Geologic Time – Period prior to humans. 4.6 billion to 3 million years ago. (See &quot;prehistoric periods&quot; for more detail into this.)
* Primatomorphid Era – Period prior to the existence of &quot;Primatomorpha&quot;
* Simian Era – Period prior to the existence of &quot;Simiiformes&quot;
* Hominoid Era – Period prior to the existence of &quot;Hominoidea&quot;
* Hominid Era – Period prior to the existence of &quot;Hominidae&quot;
**Distant signs of Human-like apes
* Homininaeid Era – Period prior to the existence of &quot;Homininae&quot;
* Homininid Era – Period prior to the existence of &quot;Hominini&quot;
* Prehistory – Period between the appearance of &quot;Homo&quot; (&quot;humans&quot;; first stone tools c. three million years ago) and the invention of writing systems (for the Ancient Near East: c. five thousand years ago).
** Paleolithic – the earliest period of the Stone Age 
*** Lower Paleolithic – time of archaic human species, predates &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;
*** Middle Paleolithic – coexistence of archaic and anatomically modern human species
*** Upper Paleolithic – worldwide expansion of anatomically modern humans, the disappearance of archaic humans by extinction or admixture with modern humans; earliest evidence for pictorial art.
** Mesolithic (Epipaleolithic) – a period in the development of human technology between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic periods.
** Neolithic – a period of primitive technological and social development, beginning about 10,200 BC in parts of the Middle East, and later in other parts of the world.
** Chalcolithic (or &quot;Eneolithic&quot;, &quot;Copper Age&quot;) – still largely Neolithic in character, when early copper metallurgy appeared alongside the use of stone tools.
** Bronze Age – not part of prehistory for all regions and civilizations who had adopted or developed a writing system.
** Iron Age – not part of prehistory for all civilizations who had introduced written records during the Bronze Age.
* Ancient history – Aggregate of past events from the beginning of recorded human history and extending as far as the Early Middle Ages or the Postclassical Era. The span of recorded history is roughly five thousand years, beginning with the earliest linguistic records in the third millennium BC in Mesopotamia and Egypt.
**Classical antiquity – Broad term for a long period of cultural history centered on the Mediterranean Sea, comprising the interlocking civilizations of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, collectively known as the Greco-Roman world. It is the period in which Greek and Roman society flourished and wielded great influence throughout Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.
* Post-classical history – Period of time that immediately followed ancient history. Depending on the continent, the era generally falls between the years AD 200–600 and AD 1200–1500. The major classical civilizations that the era follows are Han China (ending in 220), the Western Roman Empire (in 476), the Gupta Empire (in the 550s), and the Sasanian Empire (in 651). 
** Middle Ages – Lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 and is variously demarcated by historians as ending with the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, or the discovery of America by Columbus in 1492, merging into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery.
*** Early Middle Ages
*** High Middle Ages
*** Late Middle Ages
* Modern history – After the post-classical era
**Early modern period – The chronological limits of this period are open to debate. It emerges from the Late Middle Ages (c. 1500), demarcated by historians as beginning with the fall of Constantinople in 1453, in forms such as the Italian Renaissance in the West, the Ming dynasty in the East, and the rise of the Aztecs in the New World. The period ends with the beginning of the Age of Revolutions.
** Contemporary history – History within living memory. It shifts forward with the generations, and today is the span of historic events from approximately 1945 that are immediately relevant to the present time.

<doc id="86762" wikidata="Q6506" url="?curid=86762" title="Varna, Bulgaria">
<text>Varna (, ) is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast and in the Northern Bulgaria region. Situated strategically in the Gulf of Varna, the city has been a major economic, social and cultural centre for almost three millennia. Historically known as &quot;Odessos&quot; (), Varna developed from a Thracian seaside settlement into a major seaport on the Black Sea.

Varna is an important centre for business, transportation, education, tourism, entertainment, and healthcare. The city is referred to as the maritime capital of Bulgaria and has the headquarters of the Bulgarian Navy and merchant marine. In 2008, Varna was designated as the seat of the Black Sea Euroregion by the Council of Europe. In 2014, Varna was awarded the title of European Youth Capital 2017.

The oldest gold treasure in the world, belonging to the Varna culture, was discovered in the Varna Necropolis and dated to 4600–4200 BC.
Since the discovery of the Varna Necropolis in 1974, 294 burial sites have been found, with over 3000 golden items inside.

== Etymology ==

Theophanes the Confessor first mentions the name &quot;Varna&quot;, as the city came to be known, within the context of the Slavic conquest of the Balkans in the 6th to 7th centuries. The name could be of Varangian origin, as Varangians had been crossing the Black Sea for many years, reaching Constantinople in the early Middle Ages. In Swedish, &quot;värn&quot; means &#x27;shield, defense&#x27; – hence Varna could mean &#x27;defended, fortified place&#x27;. Vikings invaded the settlement during the Middle Ages. The name may be older than that; perhaps it derives from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*u̯er-&quot; &#x27;to flow, wet, water, river&#x27; (cf. Varuna), or from the Proto-Slavic root &quot;varn&quot; &#x27;black&#x27;, or from Iranian &quot;bar&quot; or &quot;var&quot; &#x27;camp, fortress&#x27; (see also Etymological list of provinces of Bulgaria).

According to Theophanes, in 680 Asparukh, the founder of the First Bulgarian Empire, routed an army of Constantine IV near the Danube River delta. Pursuing those forces, he reached &quot;the so-called Varna near Odyssos and the midlands thereof&quot; (τὴν λεγομένην Βάρναν, πλησίον Ὀδυσσοῦ). Perhaps the new name applied initially to an adjacent river or lake, a Roman military camp, or an inland area, and only later to the city itself.

By the late 10th century, the name &quot;Varna&quot; was established so firmly that when Byzantines wrested back control of the area from the Bulgarians around 975, they kept it rather than restoring the ancient name &quot;Odessos&quot;.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===

Prehistoric settlements are best known for the Chalcolithic necropolis (mid-5th millennium BC radiocarbon dating), a key archaeological site in world prehistory, eponymous Varna culture and internationally considered the world&#x27;s oldest large find of gold artefacts, existed within modern city limits. In the wider region of the Varna lakes (before the 1900s, freshwater) and the adjacent karst springs and caves, over 30 prehistoric settlements have been unearthed with the earliest artefacts dating back to the Middle Paleolithic or 100,000 years ago.

=== Thracians ===
Since late Bronze Age (13th–12th c. BC) the area around Odessos had been populated with Thracians. During 8th–9th c. BC local Thracians had active commercial and cultural contacts with people from Anatolia, Thessaly, Caucasus and the Mediterranean Sea. These links were reflected in some local productions, for example, forms of bronze fibula of the age, either imported or locally made. There is no doubt that interactions occurred mostly by sea and the bay of Odessos is one of the places where the exchanges took place. Some scholars consider that during the 1st millennium BC, the region was also settled by the half-mythical Cimmerians. An example of their, probably accidental, presence, is the tumulus dated 8th–7th c. BC found near Belogradets, Varna Province.

The region around Odessos was densely populated with Thracians long before the coming of the Greeks on the west seashore of the Black Sea. Pseudo-Scymnus writes: &quot;...Around the city [Odessos] lives the Thracian tribe named Crobises.&quot; This is also evidenced by various ceramic pottery, made by hand or by a Potter&#x27;s wheel, bronze ornaments for horse-fittings and iron weapons, all found in Thracian necropolises dated 6th–4th c. BC near the villages of Dobrina, Kipra, Brestak and other, all in Varna Province. The Thracians in the region were ruled by kings, who entered into unions with the Odrysian kingdom, Getae or Sapaeans—large Thracian states existing between 5th–1st c. BC. Between 336–280 BC these Thracian states along with Odessos were conquered by Alexander the Great.

Archaeological findings have indicated that the population of northeast Thrace was very diverse, including the region around Odessos. During 6th–4th c. BC the region was populated with Scythians who normally inhabited the central Eurasian Steppe (South Russia and Ukraine) and partly the area south of river Istros (the Thracian name of lower Danube). Characteristic for their culture weapons and bronze objects are found all over the region. Scythian horse ornaments are produced in &quot;animal style&quot;, which is very close to the Thracian style, a possible explanation for the frequent mixture of both folks in northeastern Thrace. Many bronze artefacts give testimony for such process, for example, applications and front plates for horseheads, as well as moulds for such products in nearby and more distanced settlements. Since the 4th c. BC the region had been populated by more Getae, which is a Thracian tribe populating both shores around the Danube Delta.

Celts started populating the region after their invasion of the Balkan peninsula in 280 BC. All over northeast Bulgaria and even near Odessos were found a significant number of bronze items with Celtic ornaments and typical weapons, all quickly adopted by Thracians. Arkovna, 80 km near Odessos, was probably the permanent capital of Celts&#x27; last king Kavar (270/260–216/210 BC). Probably after the downfall of his kingdom, Celts blended with the greatly numbered Thracians in the country.
Between the 2nd–1st c. BC in present Dobrudja land between Dyonissopolis (Balchik) and Odessos were created many small Scythian states. Their &quot;kings&quot; minted their coins in mints located in cities on the west Black Sea coast, including Odessos.

The Thracians in northeast Thrace seem to be underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in South Thrace. The people lived in two types of settlements: non-fortified, located in fertile lands near water sources and stone-built fortresses in hard to reach mountain environment, where were usually located the kings&#x27; residences. Thracians engaged in farming, wood processing, hunting and fishing. Among their art crafts is metal processing—especially weapons, excelling processing of bronze, making of bracelets, rings, Thracian type of fibulas, horse ornaments, arrowheads. Local goldsmiths used gold and silver to produce typical Thracian plate armour, ceremonial ornaments for the horses of the kings and the aristocracy, as well as valuable pateras and ritons.

Despite ethnic diversity, numerous internal and external conflicts, and cultural differences, the populations of northeastern Bulgaria and the cities along the seashore have demonstrated stable tolerance to each other. Conservatism is easily noticed in ceramic items and in religion. The highest deity of all was the Thracian horseman, who had different names and functions in different places. Water-related deities were honoured as well, such as The Three Graces or the water Nymphs and Zalmoxis by the Getae.
During the centuries, especially by the end of the Hellenistic period (2nd–1st c. BC), Thracians adopted the more elaborated Hellenistic culture, thus acting as an intermediate for the continental Thracians.

=== Antiquity ===

Odessos or Odessus () is one of the oldest ancient settlements in Bulgaria. Its name appears as Odesopolis (Ὀδησόπολις) in the &quot;Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax&quot;; and as Odyssos or Odyssus in the Synecdemus and in Procopius. It was established in the second quarter of the sixth century BC (585–550 BC) by Miletian Greeks on the site of a previous Thracian settlement. The Miletian founded an &quot;apoikia&quot; (trading post) of Odessos towards the end of the 7th c. BC (the earliest Greek archaeological material is dated 600–575 BC), or, according to Pseudo-Scymnus&quot;, &quot;in the time of Astyages (here, usually 572–570 BC is suggested), within an earlier Thracian settlement. The name &quot;Odessos&quot; could have been pre-Greek, arguably of Carian origin. It was the presiding member of the Pontic Pentapolis, consisting of Odessos, Tomi, Callatis, Mesembria, and Apollonia. Odessos was a mixed community—contact zone between the Ionian Greeks and the Thracian tribes (Getae, Krobyzoi, Terizi) of the hinterland. Excavations at nearby Thracian sites have shown uninterrupted occupation from the 7th to the 4th century BC and close commercial relations with the colony. The Greek alphabet has been used for inscriptions in Thracian since at least the 5th century BC. 
Odessos was included in the assessment of the Delian league of 425 BC. In 339 BC, it was unsuccessfully besieged by Philip II (priests of the Getae persuaded him to conclude a treaty) but surrendered to Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was later ruled by his diadochus Lysimachus, against whom it rebelled in 313 BC as part of a coalition with other Pontic cities and the Getae. Nevertheless, at the end of the 4th c. BC the city became one of the strongholds of Lysimachus. The city became very prosperous from this time due to strong sea trade with many of the Mediterranean states and cities supported by a wide range of local products. Shortly after 108 BC, Odessos recognised the suzerainty of Mithridates VI of Pontus.

The Roman city, &quot;Odessus&quot;, first included into the &quot;Praefectura orae maritimae&quot; and then in 15 AD annexed to the province of Moesia (later &quot;Moesia Inferior&quot;), covered 47 hectares in present-day central Varna and had prominent public baths, Thermae, erected in the late 2nd century AD (so-called Large (North) Ancient Roman Thermae), now the largest Roman remains in Bulgaria (the building was wide, long, and high) and fourth-largest-known Roman baths in Europe which testify to the importance of the city. There is also the Small (South) Ancient Roman Thermae from the 5th–6th century AD. In addition, archaeologists in 2019 discovered ruins of a building of Roman thermae from the 5th century AD.

Major athletic games were held every five years, possibly attended by Gordian III in 238.

The main aqueduct of Odessos was recently discovered during rescue excavations north of the defensive wall. The aqueduct was built in three construction periods between the 4th and the 6th centuries; in the 4th century the aqueduct was built together with the city wall, then at the end of the 4th to early 5th centuries when a pipeline was laid inside the initial masonry aqueduct. Thirdly in the 6th century, an extra pipeline was added parallel to the original west of it and entered the city through a reconstruction of the fortress wall. The city minted coins, both as an autonomous polis and under the Roman Empire from Trajan to Salonina, the wife of Gallienus, some of which survive.

Odessos was an early Christian centre, as testified by ruins of twelve early basilicas, a monophysite monastery, and indications that one of the Seventy Disciples, Ampliatus, follower of Saint Andrew (who, according to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church legend, preached in the city in 56 CE), served as bishop there. In 6th-century imperial documents, it was referred to as &quot;holiest city,&quot; &quot;sacratissima civitas&quot;. In 442 a peace treaty between Theodosius II and Attila was conducted at Odessos. In 513, it became a focal point of the Vitalian revolt. In 536, Justinian I made it the seat of the Quaestura exercitus ruled by a &quot;prefect of Scythia&quot; or &quot;quaestor Justinianus&quot; and including Lower Moesia, Scythia, Caria, the Aegean Islands and Cyprus; later, the military camp outside Odessos was the seat of another senior Roman commander, &quot;magister militum per Thracias&quot;.

=== Bulgarian conquest ===
It has been suggested that the 681 AD peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire that established the new Bulgarian state was concluded at Varna and the first Bulgarian capital south of the Danube may have been provisionally located in its vicinity—possibly in an ancient city near Lake Varna&#x27;s north shore named Theodorias (Θεοδωριάς) by Justinian I—before it moved to Pliska to the west. Asparukh fortified the Varna river lowland by a rampart against a possible Byzantine landing; the &quot;Asparuhov val&quot; (Asparukh&#x27;s Wall) is still standing. Numerous 7th-century Bulgar settlements have been excavated across the city and further west; the Varna lakes north shores, of all regions, were arguably most densely populated by Bulgars. It has been suggested that Asparukh was aware of the importance of the Roman military camp (&quot;campus tribunalis&quot;) established by Justinian I outside Odessos and considered it (or its remnants) as the legitimate seat of power for both Lower Moesia and Scythia.

=== Middle Ages ===
Control changed from Byzantine to Bulgarian hands several times during the Middle Ages. In the late 9th and the first half of the 10th century, Varna was the site of a principal scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at a monastery endowed by Boris I who may have also used it as his monastic retreat. The scriptorium may have played a key role in the development of Cyrillic script by Bulgarian scholars under the guidance of one of Saints Cyril and Methodius&#x27; disciples. Karel Škorpil suggested that Boris I may have been interred there. The synthetic culture with Hellenistic Thracian, Roman, as well as eastern—Armenian, Syrian, Persian—traits that developed around Odessos in the 6th century under Justinian I, may have influenced the Pliska-Preslav culture of the First Bulgarian Empire, ostensibly in architecture and plastic decorative arts, but possibly also in literature, including Cyrillic scholarship. In 1201, Kaloyan took over the Varna fortress, then in Byzantine hands, on Holy Saturday using a siege tower, and secured it for the Second Bulgarian Empire.


By the late 13th century, with the Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261, the offensive-defensive alliance between Michael VIII Palaeologus and Genoa that opened up the Black Sea to Genoese commerce, Varna had turned into a thriving commercial port city frequented by Genoese and later also by Venetian and Ragusan merchant ships. The first two maritime republics held consulates and had expatriate colonies there (Ragusan merchants remained active at the port through the 17th century operating from their colony in nearby Provadiya). The city was flanked by two fortresses with smaller commercial ports of their own, Kastritsi and Galata, within sight of each other, and was protected by two other strongholds overlooking the lakes, Maglizh and Petrich. Wheat, animal skins, honey and wax, wine, timber and other local agricultural produce for the Italian and Constantinople markets were the chief exports, and Mediterranean foods and luxury items were imported. The city introduced its own monetary standard, the &quot;Varna perper&quot;, by the mid-14th century; Bulgarian and Venetian currency exchange rate was fixed by a treaty. Fine jewellery, household ceramics, fine leather and food processing, and other crafts flourished; shipbuilding developed in the Kamchiya river mouth.

Fourteenth-century Italian portolan charts showed Varna as arguably the most important seaport between Constantinople and the Danube delta; they usually labelled the region Zagora. The city was unsuccessfully besieged by Amadeus VI of Savoy, who had captured all Bulgarian fortresses to the south of it, including Galata, in 1366. In 1386, Varna briefly became the capital of the spinoff Principality of Karvuna, then was taken over by the Ottomans in 1389 (and again in 1444), ceded temporarily to Manuel II Palaeologus in 1413 (perhaps until 1444), and sacked by Tatars in 1414.

=== Battle of Varna ===

On 10 November 1444, one of the last major battles of the Crusades in European history was fought outside the city walls. Ottomans routed an army of 20,000–30,000 crusaders led by Ladislaus III of Poland (also Ulászló I of Hungary), which had assembled at the port to set sail to Constantinople. The Christian army was attacked by a superior force of 55,000 or 60,000 Ottomans led by sultan Murad II. Ladislaus III was killed in a bold attempt to capture the sultan, earning the sobriquet &quot;Warneńczyk&quot; (&quot;of Varna&quot; in Polish; he is also known as &quot;Várnai Ulászló&quot; in Hungarian or &quot;Ladislaus Varnensis&quot; in Latin). The failure of the Crusade of Varna made the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 all but inevitable, and Varna (with all of Bulgaria) was to remain under Ottoman domination for over four centuries. Today, there is a cenotaph of Ladislaus III in Varna.

=== Late Ottoman rule ===
A major port, agricultural, trade and shipbuilding centre for the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries, preserving a significant and economically active Bulgarian population, Varna was later made one of the &quot;Quadrilateral Fortresses&quot; (along with Rousse, Shumen, and Silistra) severing Dobruja from the rest of Bulgaria and containing Russia in the Russo-Turkish wars. The Russians stormed the city in 1773 and besieged it in 1828; however, both ended in failure.

In the early 19th century, many local Greeks joined the patriotic organisation Filiki Eteria. Αt the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) revolutionary activity was recorded in Varna. As a result, local notables that participated in the Greek national movement were executed by the Ottoman authorities, while others managed to escape to Greece and continue their struggle.

The British and French campaigning against Russia in the Crimean War (1854–1856) used Varna as headquarters and principal naval base; many soldiers died of cholera and the city was devastated by a fire. A British and a French monument mark the cemeteries where cholera victims were interred. In 1866, the first railroad in Bulgaria connected Varna with the Rousse on the Danube, linking the Ottoman capital Constantinople with Central Europe; for a few years, the Orient Express ran through that route. The port of Varna developed as a major supplier of food—notably wheat from the adjacent breadbasket Southern Dobruja—to Constantinople and a busy hub for European imports to the capital; 12 foreign consulates opened in the city. Local Bulgarians took part in the National Revival; Vasil Levski set up a secret revolutionary committee.

=== Third Bulgarian State ===

In 1878, the city, which had 26,000 inhabitants, was given to Bulgaria by Russian troops, who entered on 27 July. Varna became a front city in the First Balkan War and the First World War; its economy was badly affected by the temporary loss of its agrarian hinterland of Southern Dobruja to Romania (1913–16 and 1919–40). In the Second World War, the Red Army occupied the city in September 1944 and helped to cement communist rule in Bulgaria.

One of the early centres of industrial development and the Bulgarian labour movement, Varna established itself as the nation&#x27;s principal port of export, a major grain-producing and viticulture centre, seat of the nation&#x27;s oldest institution of higher learning outside Sofia, a popular venue for international festivals and events, and the country&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; summer capital with the erection of the Euxinograd royal summer palace (currently, the Bulgarian government convenes summer sessions there). Mass tourism emerged since the late 1950s. Heavy industry and trade with the Soviet Union boomed in the 1950s to the 1970s.

From 20 December 1949 to 20 October 1956 the city was renamed Stalin by the communist government after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.

In 1962, the 15th Chess Olympiad, also known as the World Team Championship, organized by FIDE, was held in Varna. In 1969 and 1987, Varna was the host of the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. From 30 September to 4 October 1973, the 10th Olympic Congress took place in the Palace of Culture and Sports.

Varna became a popular resort for Eastern Europeans, who were barred from travelling to the West until 1989. One of them, the veteran East German communist Otto Braun, died on a vacation in Varna in 1974.

== Geography ==
The city occupies on verdant terraces (Varna monocline of the Moesian Platform) descending from the calcareous Franga Plateau (height ) on the north and Avren Plateau on the south, along the horseshoe-shaped Varna Bay of the Black Sea, the elongated Lake Varna, and two artificial waterways connecting the bay and the lake and bridged by the Asparuhov most. It is the centre of a growing conurbation stretching along the seaboard north and south (mostly residential and recreational sprawl) and along the lake west (mostly transportation and industrial facilities). Since antiquity, the city has been surrounded by vineyards, orchards, and forests. Commercial shipping facilities are being relocated inland into the lakes and canals, while the bay remains a recreation area; almost all the waterfront is parkland.

The urban area has in excess of 20 km of sand beaches and abounds in thermal mineral water sources (temperature ). It enjoys a mild climate influenced by the sea with long, mild, akin to Mediterranean, autumns, and sunny and hot, yet considerably cooler than Mediterranean summers moderated by breezes and regular rainfall. Although Varna receives about two-thirds of the average rainfall for Bulgaria, abundant groundwater keeps its wooded hills lush throughout summer. The city is cut off from north and northeast winds by hills along the north arm of the bay, yet January and February still can be bitterly cold at times, with blizzards. Black Sea water has become cleaner after 1989 due to decreased chemical fertiliser in farming; it has low salinity, lacks large predators or poisonous species, and the tidal range is virtually imperceptible.

The city lies north-east of Sofia; the nearest major cities are Dobrich ( to the north), Shumen ( to the west), and Burgas ( to the south-west).

=== Climate ===
Varna has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;).
The specific Black sea climate is milder than the inland parts of the country and the sea influence lowers the effect of the occasional cold air masses from the north-east. Average precipitation is the lowest for the country and sunshine is abundant. The summer begins in early May and lasts till early October. Temperatures in summer usually vary during the day and between at the night. Seawater temperature during the summer months is usually at the range . In winter temperatures are about during the day and at night. Snow is possible in the coldest months, but can quickly melt. The highest temperature ever recorded was in July 1927 and the lowest in February 1929.

== Governance ==
Varna is the administrative centre for Varna county (област, &quot;oblast&quot;, area). On the other hand, Varna municipality (община, &quot;obshtina&quot;, borough) comprises the city and five suburbs: Kamenar, Kazashko, Konstantinovo, Topoli, and Zvezditsa, served by the city public transport system.

=== Local government ===
The municipal chief executive is the Mayor (кмет, &quot;kmet&quot;: the word is cognate with count). Since the end of the &quot;de facto&quot; one-party communist rule in 1990, there have been four mayors: Voyno Voynov, SDS (Union of Democratic Forces), &quot;ad interim&quot;, 1990–91; Hristo Kirchev, SDS, 1991–99; Kiril Yordanov, independent, 1999–2013; Ivan Portnih, GERB, 2013–2023; Blagomir Kotsev, PP–DB, 2023–present.

The City council (общински съвет, &quot;obshtinski savet&quot;, the 51-member legislature) is the city&#x27;s legislative body composed of 51 members. As of January 2015 it consists of: centre-right Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), 22 council members; centre-right/right-wing Reformist Bloc Patriotic Front (Bulgaria), 6; centre-left Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 5; &quot;Varna&quot; Coalition including Attack, 4; other smaller parties, groups and independent members, 14.
The Council chairman is Todor Balabanov (GERB).

Varna regional court is one of the busiest courts in the country. The city also headquarters the district, administrative, and military court, and a court of appeal as well as regional, military, and appellate prosecutor&#x27;s offices.

=== Boroughs and urban planning ===
The city is divided by law into five boroughs (), each with its mayor and council: Asparuhovo, Mladost, Odessos (the historic centre), Primorski (the largest one with official population of 102,000 also comprising the seaside resorts north of the city centre), and Vladislav Varchenchik. The boroughs are composed of various districts with distinctive characters and histories. The villages too have а mayor or a mayoral lieutenant (кметски наместник, &quot;kmetski namestnik&quot;).

=== Policing and crime ===

Varna was rumoured to be the hub of Bulgarian organised crime. Some sectors of the economy, including gambling, corporate security, tourism, real estate, and professional sports, were believed to be controlled in part by business groups with links to Communist-era secret services or the military.

However, it is noted that in Varna, the so-called &quot;mutri&quot; (Mafia) presence was by no means as visible as it was in smaller coastal towns and resorts. Over the last couple of years, crime has subsided, which is said to have contributed to Varna being named as Bulgaria&#x27;s Best City to Live In (2007); in 2007, the regional police chief was promoted to the helm of the national police service.

=== Consulates ===
There are consulates of the following countries:
Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine.

=== Twin towns – sister cities ===
Varna is twinned with:

* Barcelona, Spain
* Bari, Italy
* Bradford, England, United Kingdom
* Cape Town, South Africa
* Dordrecht, Netherlands
* Eimsbüttel (Hamburg), Germany
* Genoa, Italy
* Kavala, Greece

== Demography ==


The first population data date back to the mid-17th century when the town was thought to have about 4,000 inhabitants, while the first population census in 1881 counted 24,555. According to the 1883 census, it was the second-largest in Bulgaria after Ruse. Thereafter Varna became Bulgaria&#x27;s third-largest city and kept this position steadily for the next 120 years, while different cities took turns in the first, second, and fourth places.In January 2012, the city of Varna has a population of 334,781, which makes it the third-largest city in Bulgaria, while the Varna Municipality along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 343,643 inhabitants. The unofficial metro area (including Varna municipality and adjacent parts of Aksakovo, Avren, Beloslav, and Devnya municipalities, and excluding adjacent parts of Dobrich Province) has an estimated population of 475,000. Here, the &quot;Varna-Devnya-Provadiya agglomeration&quot; is not considered identical to the &quot;Varna metro area&quot;.

Varna is one of the few cities in Bulgaria with a positive natural growth (6300 births vs. 3600 deaths in 2009) and new children&#x27;s day care centers opening (6 expected in 2009).

Since December 2006, various sources, including the Bulgarian National Television, national newspapers, research agencies, the mayor&#x27;s office, and local police, claim that Varna has a population by present address of over 500,000, making it the nation&#x27;s second-largest city. Official statistics according to GRAO and NSI, however, have not supported their claims. In 2008, Deputy Mayor Venelin Zhechev estimated the actual population at 650,000. In December 2008, Mayor Kiril Yordanov claimed the actual number of permanent residents was 970,000, or that there were 60% unregistered people. In January 2009, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; said that &quot;Varna now draws about 30,000 new residents a year.&quot; The census, carried out in February 2011, enumerated 334,870 inhabitants.
If unregistered population plus the commuters from the adjacent municipalities are taken into consideration, the real population of the city during a work day reaches 400,000. Varna attracts 2 to 3 million tourists a year, as the holidaymakers may reach as many as 200,000 daily during the high season. Thus, there are about 600,000 people in the city in July and August.
===Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition===


Most Varnians (варненци, &quot;varnentsi&quot;) are ethnic Bulgarians (94%). Ethnic Turks rank second with 3%; however by 2009, Russians and other Russian-speaking recent immigrants with no Bulgarian citizenship, estimated at over 20,000, perhaps have outnumbered them, additionally there is a growing number of new Asian and African immigrants and corporate expatriates. These are mostly students of the medical university of Varna. There is a comparable number of Romani (1% of the population) mostly in three distinctive and largely impoverished neighbourhoods: Maksuda; Rozova Dolina in the Asparuhovo district; and Chengene Kula in the Vladislavovo district, while Varna is spearheading several programs on Romani integration. Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and other long-standing ethnic groups are also present although in much smaller numbers. With the departure of most Turks and Greeks and the arrival of Bulgarian refugees and settlers from inland, Northern Dobruja, Bessarabia, and Asia Minor, and later, of refugees from Macedonia, Eastern Thrace and Southern Dobruja following the Second Balkan War and the First World War, ethnic diversity gave way to Bulgarian predominance, although sizeable minorities of Gagauz, Armenians, and Sephardic Jews remained for decades.

According to the 1876 census of the Danube Vilayet in the Ottoman Empire, the population of Varna consisted of a majority of Bulgarians (50%) and a minority of Muslims (over 40%). A significant part were Turkish-speaking Christians (Gagauzes) who identified as Bulgarians.

According to the 1881 census in Bulgaria, the Turkish language was a mother tongue for 8903 people (36.25%), for 6721 was the Bulgarian (27.36%), for 5,367 was Greek (21.85%) and Tatar for 837 (3.41%). By ethnic group, ethnic Bulgarians were then 6,714, of whom 4478 men and 2236 women.

According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:
*Bulgarians: 284,738 (93.8%)
*Turks: 10,028 (3.6%)
*Romani: 3,162 (1.0%)
*Others: 3,378 (1.1%)
*Indefinable: 2,288 (0.8%)
**Undeclared: 31,276 (10.3%)
Total: 334,781

In Varna Municipality 290,780 declared as Bulgarians, 11,089 as Turks, 3,535 as Romani and 34,758 did not declare their ethnic group.

According to the 2001 census data, the ethnic composition was as follows:
*Bulgarians: 296,407 (92.5%)
*Turks: 12,295 (3.8%)
*Romani: 3,748 (1.2%)
*Others: 4,566 (1.4%)
*Indefinable: 2,406 (0.8%)
**Undeclared: 1,042 (0.3%)
Total: 320,464

== Economy ==

Economically, Varna is among the best-performing and fastest-growing Bulgarian cities. In 2016 the unemployment rate is 3.5% and the average salary is nearly 900lv (450€) per month.
The economy is service-based, with 61% of net revenue generated in trade and tourism, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in transportation and communications, and 6% in construction. Financial services, particularly banking, insurance, investment management, and real-estate finance are booming. As of December 2008, the fallout of the global financial crisis has not yet been hard. The city is the easternmost destination of Pan-European transport corridor 8 and is connected to corridors 7 and 9 via Rousse. Major industries traditionally include transportation (Navibulgar, Port of Varna, Varna Airport), distribution (Logistics Park Varna), shipbuilding (see also Oceanic-Creations), ship repair, and other marine industries.

The largest port in Bulgaria is the Port of Varna through which over 7m tonnes of freight moves annually. 

In June 2007, Eni and Gazprom disclosed the South Stream project whereby a offshore natural gas pipeline from Russia&#x27;s Dzhubga with annual capacity of was planned to come ashore at Varna, possibly near the Galata offshore gas field, en route to Italy and Austria. Nevertheless, the project was stopped due to the EU-Russia conflict.

With the nearby towns of Beloslav and Devnya, Varna forms the Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex, home to some of the largest chemical, thermal power, and manufacturing facilities in Bulgaria, including Varna Thermal Power Plant and &quot;Sodi Devnya&quot;, the two largest cash privatisation deals in the country&#x27;s recent history. There are also notable facilities for radio navigation devices, household appliances, security systems, textiles, apparel, food and beverages, printing, and other industries. Some manufacturing veterans are giving way to post-industrial developments: an ECE shopping mall is taking the place of the former VAMO diesel engine works and the Varna Brewery is being replaced by a convention centre.


Tourism is of foremost importance with the suburban beachfront resorts of Golden Sands, Riviera Holiday Club, Sunny Day, Saints Constantine and Helena attracting around 1 million foreign tourists in 2016. The resorts received considerable internal and foreign investment in the late 1990s and early in the first decade of the 21st century, and are environmentally sound, being located reassuringly far from chemical and other smokestack industries. Varna is also Bulgaria&#x27;s only international cruise destination with 36 cruises for 2014 and a major international conference and SPA centre. Varna South Bay is also becoming a popular area for tourists

The highest building in the city is Interhotel Cherno More at 72.2 meters.

Real estate boomed in 2003–2008 with some of the highest prices in the country, by fall 2007 surpassing Sofia. In 2017 Varna is second in terms of construction projects.

In retail, the city not only has the assortment of international big-box retailers, now found in larger Bulgarian cities, but boasts made-in-Varna national chains with locations spreading over the country such as retailer Piccadilly, the famous restaurant chain &quot;Happy&quot; and pharmacy chain &quot;Sanita&quot;. Mall Varna, Grand Mall and Delta Planet Mall are the three largest shopping centres in Varna, turning the city into an attractive shopping destination. The city has many of the finest eateries in the nation and abounds in ethnic food places.
There is a plethora of Internet cafes and many places, including parks, are covered by free public wireless internet service. Varna is connected to other Black Sea cities by the submarine Black Sea Fibre Optic Cable System.

In 2016 Varna won the vote of Darik Radio listeners and was awarded &quot;Best city to live&quot; and &quot;Protector of History&quot;.

== Transport ==

Varna is accessible by air (Varna International Airport), sea (Port of Varna Cruise Terminal), railway (Central railway station), bus, and road.

Major roads include European roads Varna – Bucharest E70, Varna – Istanbul E87 and Varna – Constanta, Romania; national motorways Varna – Sofia A2 (Hemus motorway) and Varna – Burgas A5 (Cherno More motorway). 
There are bus routes to many Bulgarian and international cities from two bus terminals. There are also train, ferry and roll-on/roll-off services to Odesa, Ukraine, Port Kavkaz, Russia, Poti and Batumi, Georgia.

The public transport system is managed by &quot;City Transport Varna&quot; and has been recently modernised. Ticket prices are reasonable: from 1lv (0.50€) for city zones to 3lv (1.50€) for routes Varna – Golden Sands. Along with local buses, trolleybuses, fixed-route minibus lines, there is also a large fleet of taxis.

In 2021, a light rail (LRT) system was proposed by the municipality. It is expected to connect the airport with the central part of the city, with several underground sections and stations. The funding will be provided by the EU programmes.

== Landmarks ==
City landmarks include the Varna Archaeological Museum, exhibiting the &quot;Gold of Varna&quot;, the Roman Baths, the Battle of Varna Park Museum, the Naval Museum in the Italianate &quot;Villa Assareto&quot; displaying the museum ship &quot;Drazki torpedo boat&quot;, the Museum of Ethnography in an Ottoman-period compound featuring the life of local urban dwellers, fisherfolk, and peasants in the late 19th and early 20th century.

You can see the highlight landmarks using Varna City Card – it combines all essential cultural locations, gives many discounts to tourists in restaurants and bars, and overall saves money.

The &#x27;Sea Garden&#x27; is the oldest and perhaps largest park in town containing an open-air theatre (venue of the International Ballet Competition, opera performances and concerts), Varna Aquarium (opened 1932), the Festa Dolphinarium (opened 1984), the Nicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium, the Museum of Natural History, a terrarium, a zoo, an alpineum, a children&#x27;s amusement park with a pond, boathouse and ice-skating rink, and other attractions. The National Revival Alley is decorated with bronze monuments to prominent Bulgarians, and the Cosmonauts&#x27; Alley contains trees planted by Yuri Gagarin and other Soviet and Bulgarian cosmonauts. The Garden is a national monument of landscape architecture and is said to be the largest landscaped park in the Balkans.

The waterfront promenade is lined by a string of beach clubs offering a vibrant scene of rock, hip-hop, Bulgarian and American-style pop, techno, and chalga. In October 2006, &quot;The Independent&quot; dubbed Varna &quot;Europe&#x27;s new funky-town, the good-time capital of Bulgaria&quot;. The city enjoys a nationwide reputation for its rock, hip-hop, world music, and other artists, clubs, and related events such as July Morning and international rock and hip-hop (including graffiti) venues.

The city beaches, also known as &quot;sea baths&quot; (морски бани, &quot;morski bani&quot;), are dotted with hot (up to 55°С/131 °F) sulphuric mineral water sources (used for spas, swimming pools and public showers) and punctured by small sheltered marinas. Additionally, the long, high Asparuhov most bridge is a popular spot for bungee jumping. Outside the city are the Euxinograd palace, park and winery, the University of Sofia Botanical Garden (Ecopark Varna), the Pobiti Kamani rock phenomenon, and the medieval cave monastery, Aladzha.

Tourist shopping areas include the boutique rows along Prince Boris Blvd (with retail rents rivalling Vitosha Blvd in Sofia) and adjacent pedestrian streets, as well as the large mall and big-box cluster in the Mladost district, suitable for motorists. Two other shopping plazas, Piccadilly Park and Central Plaza, are conveniently located to serve tourists in the resorts north of the city centre, both driving and riding the public transit. ATMs and 24/7 gas stations with convenience stores abound.

Food markets, among others, include supermarket chains Billa, Kaufland and Metro. In stores and restaurants, credit cards are normally accepted. There is a number of farmers markets offering fresh local produce; the Kolkhozen Pazar, the largest one, also has a fresh fish market but is located in a crowded area virtually inaccessible for cars.

Like other cities in the region, Varna has its share of stray dogs, calm and friendly, flashing orange clips on the ears showing they have been castrated and vaccinated. However, urban wildlife is dominated by the ubiquitous seagulls, while brown squirrels inhabit the Sea Garden. Cats are also everywhere in the city. In January and February, migrating swans winter on the sheltered beaches.

=== Churches ===


Notable old Bulgarian Orthodox temples include the metropolitan Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral (of the diocese of Varna and Veliki Preslav); the early-17th-century Theotokos Panagia (built on the site of an earlier church where Ladislaus III was perhaps buried); the St. Athanasius (former Greek metropolitan cathedral) on the footprint of a razed 10th-century church; the 15th-century St. Petka Parashkeva chapel; the seamen&#x27;s church of Saint Nicholas; the Archangel Michael chapel, site of the first Bulgarian secular school from the National Revival era; and the Sts. Constantine and Helena church of the 14th-century suburban monastery of the same name.

The remains of a large 4th- to 5th-century stronghold basilica in Dzhanavara Park just south of town are becoming a tourist destination with some exquisite mosaics displayed &quot;in situ&quot;. The remains of another massive 9th-century basilica adjacent to the scriptorium at Boris I&#x27;s Theotokos Panagia monastery are being excavated and conserved. A 4th- to 5th-century episcopal basilica north of the Thermae is also being restored. There is also a number of newer Orthodox temples; two, dedicated to apostle Andrew and the local martyr St. Procopius of Varna, are currently under construction. Many smaller Orthodox chapels have mushroomed in the area. In early 2009, Vasil Danev, leader of the ethnic Organization of the United Roma Communities (FORO), said local Roma would also erect an Orthodox chapel.

There is an Armenian Apostolic church; two Roman Catholic churches, a thriving Evangelical Methodist episcopal church offering organ concerts, active Evangelical Pentecostal, Seventh-day Adventist, and two Baptist churches.

Two old mosques (one is open) have survived since Ottoman times, when there were 18 of them in town, as have two once stately but now dilapidated synagogues, a Sephardic and an Ashkenazic one, the latter in Gothic style (it is undergoing restoration). A new mosque was recently added in the southern Asparuhovo district serving the adjacent Muslim Roma neighbourhood.

There is also a Buddhist centre.

On a different note, spiritual master Peter Deunov started preaching his Esoteric Christianity doctrine in Varna in the late 1890s, and, in 1899–1908, the yearly meetings of his Synarchic Chain, later known as the Universal White Brotherhood, were convened there.

=== Architecture ===

By 1878, Varna was an Ottoman city of mostly wooden houses in a style characteristic of the Black Sea coast, densely packed along narrow, winding lanes. It was surrounded by a stone wall restored in the 1830s with a citadel, a moat, ornamented iron gates flanked by towers, and a vaulted stone bridge across the River Varna. The place abounded in pre-Ottoman relics, ancient ruins were widely used as stone quarries.

Today, very little of this legacy remains; the city centre was rebuilt by the nascent Bulgarian middle class in late 19th and early 20th centuries in Western style with local interpretations of Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque, Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco (many of those buildings, whose ownership was restored after 1989, underwent renovations).

Stone masonry from demolished city walls was used for the cathedral, the two elite high schools, and for paving new boulevards. The middle class built practical townhouses and coop buildings. Elegant mansions were erected on main boulevards and in the vineyards north of town. A few industrial working-class suburbs (of one-family cottages with small green yards) emerged. Refugees from the 1910s wars also settled in similar poorer yet vibrant neighbourhoods along the city edges.

During the rapid urbanisation of the 1960s to the early 1980s, large apartment complexes sprawled onto land formerly covered by small private vineyards or agricultural cooperatives as the city population tripled. Beach resorts were designed mostly in a sleek modern style, which was somewhat lost in their recent more lavish renovations. Modern landmarks of the 1960s include the Palace of Culture and Sports, built in 1968.

With the country&#x27;s return to capitalism since 1989, upscale apartment buildings mushroomed both downtown and on uptown terraces overlooking the sea and the lake. Varna&#x27;s vineyards (лозя, &quot;lozya&quot;), dating back perhaps to antiquity and stretching for miles around, started turning from mostly rural grounds dotted with summer houses or &quot;villa&quot; into affluent suburbs sporting opulent villas and family hotels, epitomised by the researched postmodernist kitsch of the Villa Aqua.

With the new suburban construction far outpacing infrastructure growth, ancient landslides were activated, temporarily disrupting major highways. As the number of vehicles quadrupled since 1989, Varna became known for traffic jams; parking on the old town&#x27;s leafy but narrow streets normally takes the sidewalks. At the same time, stretches of shanty towns, more befitting Rio de Janeiro, remain in Romani neighbourhoods on the western edge of town due to complexities of local politics.

The beach resorts were rebuilt and expanded, fortunately without being as heavily overdeveloped as were other tourist destinations on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, and their greenery was mostly preserved. New modern office buildings started reshaping the old centre and the city&#x27;s surroundings.

== Sports ==

=== Football ===
In the late 19th century, Varna was considered the birthplace of Bulgarian football with a Swiss gym teacher, Georges de Regibus, coaching the first varsity team at the men&#x27;s high school. Association football is the biggest spectator sport with two rival clubs in the nation&#x27;s top professional league, Cherno More (&quot;the Sailors&quot;), founded in 1913 and four times national champion, including the first championship in 1925, and Spartak (&quot;the Falcons&quot;), founded in 1918, one time champion and participant in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1983, when it reached the second knockout round and played Manchester United. Few other football academies exist. In 2021

From 1993 to 2003, Grand Hotel Varna was a hegemon in the women football league, winning 10 consecutive titles.

By 2024, Spartak Stadium and Ticha Stadium are the biggest stadiums in town, since Yuri Gagarin Stadium demolition. New Varna Stadium is currently in construction on the place of Gagarin Stadium and is expected to become the biggest stadium in the city.

=== Swimming ===
Modern Bulgarian swimming dates to 18 May 1923 when the Bulgarian Public Marine Union was established in Varna. The organisation was the first to manage and administer swimming as a sport in Bulgaria. Famous Bulgarian swimmers from Varna are Aleksi Aleksiev (aka the Pope), Milko Rachev (aka Brother Milko), Maria Nikolova, Julian Rusev. Some of the leading swimming clubs are PSK Cherno More, KPS Asteri, KPS Torpedo, SKPS Albatros and KPS Cherno More.

Julian Rusev pool is the second oldest 50 m Olympic-size pool in the country, built in 1964 and located on the South beach in Varna. After a major redevelopment in 2008 council owned entity was established named Swimming Complex &quot;Primorski&quot;. The 50m pool, now in line with FINA pool criteria, was adjacent to the water polo and diving pool &quot;Aleksi Aleksiev&quot;. Subsequently, a third 25 m covered pool was built next to the diving pool along with a SPA &amp; gym centre.
There are three other swimming pools in the city.

On the first Sunday of August the marathon &quot;Galata – Varna&quot; takes place, the oldest Bulgarian swimming marathon. It dates back to 1939 and it attracts nearly 300 national and foreign swimmers. Bulgaria greatest swimmer Petar Stoychev holds the all-time record of 46 min for swimming the 4.5 km open water distance, crossing the Varna Bay.

=== Other sports ===
Men&#x27;s basketball (Euroins Cherno More), women&#x27;s volleyball, gymnastics, boxing, martial arts, sailing and tennis are also vibrant. A karting racing and a go kart track and a hippodrome with a horseback riding school is located in the Vinitsa neighborhood.

Another horse club is located just 10 minutes&#x27; drive away from Varna in the nearby village of Kichevo. Asparuhov bridge is a major Bulgarian bungee jumping site managed by &quot;Club Adrenalin&quot;. Cricket has been most recently introduced by ex-pats from cricket playing nations to the city&#x27;s sport scene.

In August 2007 a new public leisure centre was opened in Mladost district. The track-field stadium consists of football, basketball and volleyball fields and is part of a larger complex of sports facilities for mini-golf, tennis, biking, mini-lakes and ice-skating. Other public leisure centres opened in the Sea Garden, Asparuhov Park and elsewhere. The number and range of gym and recreation clubs in Varna have increased in recent years, which reflects the healthy lifestyle of the average Varna citizens.

In the region, there are three golf courses—Lighthouse Golf Club, BlackSeaRama Golf &amp; Villas and Thracian Cliffs Golf &amp; Beach Resort. The three 18-hole golf courses are of professional quality, constructed in the region to the north of the city in the vicinity of Balchik and Kavarna.

<doc id="86765" wikidata="Q15951126" url="?curid=86765" title="Sissy">
<text>Sissy (derived from &quot;sister&quot;), also &quot;sissy baby&quot;, &quot;sissy boy&quot;, &quot;sissy man&quot;, &quot;sissy pants&quot;, etc., is a pejorative term for a boy or man who does not demonstrate masculine traits, and shows possible signs of fragility. Generally, &quot;sissy&quot; implies a lack of courage, strength, athleticism, coordination, testosterone, male libido, and stoicism. A man might also be considered a sissy for being interested in typically feminine hobbies or employment (e.g., being fond of fashion), displaying effeminate behavior (e.g., using hair products, hydrating products, or displaying limp wrists), being unathletic or being homosexual.

&quot;Sissy&quot; is, approximately, the male converse of &quot;tomboy&quot; (a girl with masculine traits or interests), but carries more strongly negative connotations. Research published in 2015 suggests that the terms are asymmetrical in their power to stigmatize: &quot;sissy&quot; is almost always pejorative and conveys greater severity, while &quot;tomboy&quot; rarely causes as much concern but also elicits pressure to conform to social expectations. In some communities, especially ones whose members are prominently part of Generation Z, highly effeminate males are referred to as &quot;femboys&quot; (feminine boy), a term which aims to provide a way to refer to effeminate males without negative connotations.

== Affectionate diminutive ==

&quot;Sissy&quot; is also a term of endearment used as a diminutive for the female given name Cecilia. Its usage as a diminutive for Cecilia dates back to at least the late 19th century. Its usage is explicitly called out in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Hard Times: For These Times&quot;. However, it has since fallen out of favor, coinciding with the rise in its usage as a pejorative.

==History and usage==
The term &quot;sissy&quot; has historically been used among school children as a &quot;relentlessly negative&quot; insult, implying immaturity and gender or sexual deviance. It has been identified as sexist in guidance issued to schools in the United Kingdom and described as &quot;just as unacceptable as racist and homophobic language.&quot; The terms &quot;gender creative&quot;, &quot;pink boy&quot;, and &quot;tomgirl&quot; have been suggested as polite alternatives. The Japanese word &#x27; (literally &quot;beautiful youth&quot;) and the Korean word &#x27; (literally &quot;flower boy&quot;) are also polite terms for a man or boy with gentle or feminine attributes.

The word &quot;sissy&quot; in its original meaning of &quot;sister&quot; entered American English around 1840–1850 and acquired its pejorative meaning around 1885–1890; the verb &quot;sissify&quot; appeared in 1900–1905. In comparison, the word &quot;tomboy&quot; is approximately three centuries older, dating to 1545–1555.

By the 1930s, &quot;there was no more damning insult than to be called a &quot;sissy&quot;&quot; and the word was widely used by American football coaches and sports writers to disparage rival teams and encourage ferocious player behavior. The use of the word &quot;sissy&quot; was &quot;ubiquitous&quot; among delinquent American youth of the 1930s; the term was used to provoke boys to join gangs, demean boys who violated group norms, force compliance with the mandates of masculinity, and justify violence (including sexual violence) against younger and weaker children. Good students were taunted as sissies and clothing styles associated with higher social classes were demeaned as &quot;sissified.&quot; Among members of a Detroit, Michigan youth gang in 1938–39, &quot;sissy&quot; was &quot;the ultimate slur&quot; used to tease and taunt other boys, as a rationalization for violence against rivals, and as an excuse for not observing the dicta of middle-class decorum and morality.

By the late 1980s, some men began to reclaim the term &quot;sissy&quot; for themselves. The spelling variation &quot;cissy&quot; was used in British English, at least prior to the mid 1970s. In the United States, the Comedy Central television series &quot;South Park&quot; inverted its meaning in a 2014 episode titled &quot;The Cissy&quot;, which lampooned the controversy over transgender students&#x27; use of school restrooms; in the episode, a restroom initially designated for use by transgender students is later re-designated as &quot;the cissy bathroom&quot; for use by transphobic cisgender students.

== As threats to masculine dominance ==
In China, men who display feminine characteristics are sometimes perceived as threats to masculine power. For example, in 2018, official Chinese state media derided &quot;sissy pants&quot; young men (who use makeup, are slender, and wear androgynous clothing) as part of a &quot;sickly&quot; culture that threatened the future of the nation by undermining its militaristic image. In 2021, China&#x27;s Ministry of Education issued guidelines for the &quot;cultivation of students&#x27; masculinity&quot; to &quot;prevent the feminization of male adolescents&quot; through sports, physical education, and &quot;health education&quot; in schools.

In 2021, the National Radio and Television Administration of China added a ban on &quot;sissy men and other abnormal esthetics&quot; to its rules using the offensive term .

==In gender and LGBT studies==
In his &quot;The &quot;Sissy Boy Syndrome&quot; and the Development of Homosexuality&quot; (1987), the sexologist Richard Green compared two groups of boys: one group was conventionally masculine; the other group, who Green called &quot;feminine boys&quot; and other children called &quot;sissy&quot;, engaged in doll play and other behavior typical for girls. In his 15-year longitudinal study, Green looked at cross-gender behavior in boys who later turned out to be transgender, or homosexual as well as a control group, and analyzed such features as interest in sports, playroom toy preferences, doll-play fantasy, physical behavior (&quot;acting like a girl&quot; vs rough-and-tumble play), cross-dressing, and psychological behavior, using tests, questionnaires, interviews, and follow-ups. He also looked at the influence of parental relationships and reaction to atypical behavior. Later follow-ups found that, ultimately, of the feminine or &quot;sissy&quot; boys developed into gay or bisexual men, whereas only one of the control group did. Analysis of the nature/nurture issue was inconclusive.

The term sissyphobia denotes a negative cultural reaction against &quot;sissy boys&quot; thought prevalent in 1974. Sissyphobia has more recently been used in some queer studies; other authors in this latter area have proposed &quot;effeminiphobia,&quot; &quot;femiphobia,&quot; &quot;femmephobia,&quot; or &quot;effemimania&quot; as alternative terms.

Gregory M. Herek wrote that sissyphobia arises as a combination of misogyny and homophobia. Communication scholar Shinsuke Eguchi (2011) stated: The discourse of straight-acting produces and reproduces anti-femininity and homophobia (Clarkson. 2006). For example, feminine gay men are often labeled &quot;fem,&quot; &quot;bitchy,&quot; &quot;pissy,&quot; &quot;sissy,&quot; or &quot;queen&quot; (e.g., Christian, 2005; Clarkson, 2006; Payne, 2007). They are perceived as if they perform like &quot;women,&quot; spurring straight-acting gay men to have negative attitudes toward feminine-acting gay men (Clarkson, 2006; Payne, 2007; Ward, 2000). This is called sissyphobia (Bergling, 2001). Kimmel (1996) supports that &quot;masculinity has been (historically) defined as the flight from women and the repudiation of femininity&quot; (p. 123). Thus, sissyphobia plays as the communication strategy for straight-acting gay men to justify and empower their masculinity. (p. 38).

Eguchi added, &quot;I wonder how &#x27;sissyphobia&#x27; particularly plays into the dynamic of domestic violence processes in the straight-acting and effeminate-acting male same-sex coupling pattern.&quot; (p. 53).

==In sexual subcultures==
In the BDSM practice of forced feminization, the male bottom undergoing cross-dressing may be called a sissy as a form of erotic humiliation. Another common theme is the use of a chastity belt, compounding the male bottom&#x27;s humiliation by restricting the size and access to their genitals.

In paraphilic infantilism, a &quot;sissy baby&quot; is a man who likes to play the role of a baby girl.

Arne Jacobsen was born on 11 February 1902 in Copenhagen. His father Johan was a wholesale trader in safety pins and snap fasteners. His mother Pouline was a bank teller whose hobby was floral motifs. He is of Jewish descent. He first hoped to become a painter, but was dissuaded by his mother, who encouraged him to opt instead for the more secure domain of architecture. After a spell as an apprentice mason, Jacobsen was admitted to the Architecture School at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where from 1924 to 1927 he studied under Kay Fisker and Kaj Gottlob, both leading architects and designers.

Still a student, in 1925 Jacobsen participated in the Paris Art Deco fair, &quot;Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes&quot;, where he won a silver medal for a chair design. On that trip, he was struck by the pioneering aesthetic of Le Corbusier&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Esprit Nouveau&quot; pavilion. Before leaving the Academy, Jacobsen also travelled to Germany, where he became acquainted with the rationalist architecture of Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius. Their work influenced his early designs including his graduation project, an art gallery, which won him a gold medal. After completing architecture school, he first worked at city architect Poul Holsøe&#x27;s architectural practice.

In 1929, in collaboration with Flemming Lassen, he won a Danish Architect&#x27;s Association competition for designing the &quot;House of the Future&quot; which was built full scale at the subsequent exhibition in Copenhagen&#x27;s Forum. It was a spiral-shaped, flat-roofed house in glass and concrete, incorporating a private garage, a boathouse and a helicopter pad. Other striking features were windows that rolled down like car windows, a conveyor tube for the mail and a kitchen stocked with ready-made meals. A Dodge Cabriolet Coupé was parked in the garage, there was a Chris Craft in the boathouse and an Autogyro on the roof. Jacobsen immediately became recognised as an ultra-modern architect.

===Pre-World War II career===

The year after winning the &quot;House of the Future&quot; award, Arne Jacobsen set up his own office. He designed the functionalist Rothenborg House, which he planned in every detail, a characteristic of many of his later works.

Soon afterwards, he won a competition from Gentofte Municipality for the design of a seaside resort complex in Klampenborg on the Øresund coast just north of Copenhagen. The various components of the resort became his major public breakthrough in Denmark, further establishing him as a leading national proponent of the International Modern Style. In 1932, the first item, the Bellevue Sea Bath, was completed. Jacobsen designed everything from the characteristic blue-striped lifeguard towers, kiosks and changing cabins to the tickets, season cards and even the uniforms of the employees. The focal point of the area was supposed to have been a lookout tower, more than a hundred metres high with a revolving restaurant at the top but it was abandoned after huge local protests. Still, it is reflected in the overall arrangement of buildings in the area which all follow lines that extend from their missing centre. In 1934, came the Bellavista residential development, built in concrete, steel and glass, with smooth surfaces and open floor planning, free of any excesses or ornaments. Completing the white trilogy in 1937, the Bellevue Theatre featured a retractable roof allowing open-air performances. These early works clearly show the influence of the White Cubist architecture Jacobsen had encountered in Germany, particularly at the Weissenhof Estate in Stuttgart. The cluster of white buildings at Bellevue also includes the Skovshoved Filling Station. In their day, these projects were described as &quot;The dream of the modern lifestyle&quot;.
Despite considerable public opposition to his avant-garde style, Jacobsen went on to build Stelling House on Gammeltorv, one of Copenhagen&#x27;s most historic squares. Although the modernistic style is rather restrained and was later seen as a model example of building in a historic setting, it caused virulent protests in its day. One newspaper wrote that Jacobsen ought to be &quot;banned from architecture for life&quot;.

When, together with Erik Møller, he won a competition for the design of Århus City Hall it was with yet another controversial design. It was deemed too modern and too anti-monumental. In the end Jacobsen had to add a tower as well as marble cladding. Still, it is considered one of his most important buildings. It consists of three offset volumes.

===World War II exile and return===

During World War II, scarcity of building materials and Nazi racial laws against Jewish citizens made assignments difficult to obtain. In 1943, due to his Jewish background, Arne Jacobsen had to flee his office and go into exile to escape the Nazis&#x27; planned deportation of Jewish Danes to concentration camps. Along with other Jewish Danes and with the help of the Danish resistance, he fled Denmark, rowing a small boat across Øresund to neighboring Sweden where he would stay for the next two years. His architectural work was limited to a summer house for two doctors. Instead he spent his time designing fabrics and wallpaper.

When the war ended in 1945, Jacobsen returned to Denmark and resumed his architectural career. The country was in urgent need of both housing and new public buildings but the primary need was for spartan buildings which could be built without delay.

After some years Jacobsen got his career back on track and with projects such as the Allehusene complex from 1952 and his Søholm terraced houses from 1955, he embarked on a more experimental phase. He moved into one of the Søholm houses and lived there until his death.
Rødovre Town Hall, built from 1952 to 1956, shows how well Jacobsen combined the use of different materials: sandstone, two types of glass, painted metalwork and stainless steel. It is also noted for its central staircase, suspended from the roof on orange-red steel rods. The sides are cut from 5 cm steel plate, painted a dark grey; the steps, only a few millimeters thick, are stainless steel with a rubber coating on the upper side for better grip.

The Munkegaard School consists of pavilions connected by glass corridors, arranged in a grid system around small courtyards. It received considerable attention in international school circles and contributed to his growing international reputation.

===Large commissions===
With the SAS Royal Hotel, built from 1956 to 1960, Jacobsen was given the opportunity to design what has been called &quot;the world&#x27;s first designer hotel.&quot; He designed everything from the building and its furniture and fittings to the ashtrays sold in the souvenir shop and the airport buses.
These larger assignments started to attract attention and commissions from abroad. Rødovre Town Hall secured him an invitation for his first competition in Germany which was followed by a number of other German projects.

A delegation of Oxford dons visited the SAS Hotel and the Munkegård School in their search for an architect for St Catherine&#x27;s College. They were soon convinced he was the right choice for their important commission. Again Jacobsen designed everything, including the garden, down to the choice of fish species for the pond. The dining hall is notable for its Cumbrian slate floor. The original college buildings received a Grade I listing on 30 March 1993. Some individual buildings on the campus also have their own, high, listings, including the Grade I listed bike shed.

===Incomplete works===
When Arne Jacobsen died unexpectedly in 1971, he had a number of large projects under way. These included a new town hall in Mainz, Germany, and in Castrop-Rauxel, Germany, the Danish National Bank and the Royal Danish Embassy in London. These projects were completed by Dissing+Weitling, a firm set up by his former key employees Hans Dissing and Otto Weitling.

==Furniture and product design==

Today, Arne Jacobsen is remembered primarily for his furniture designs. However, he believed he was first and foremost an architect. According to Scott Poole, a professor at Virginia Tech, Arne Jacobsen never used the word &#x27;designer&#x27;, notoriously disliking it.

His way into product design came through his interest in Gesamtkunst and most of his designs which later became famous in their own right were created for architectural projects. One of his first furniture designs was the Paris lounge chair from 1929 which was also displayed as a part of the interior design of his famous “House of the Future&quot;. Most of his furniture designs were the result of a cooperation with the furniture manufacturer Fritz Hansen with which he initiated a collaboration in 1934 while his lamps and light fixtures were developed with Louis Poulsen. In spite of his success with his chair at the Paris Exhibition in 1925, it was during the 1950s that his interest in furniture design peaked.

A major source of inspiration stemmed from the bent plywood designs of Charles and Ray Eames. He was also influenced by the Italian design historian Ernesto Rogers, who had proclaimed that the design of every element was equally important &quot;from the spoon to the city&quot; which harmonized well with his own ideals.
In 1951, he created the Ant chair for an extension of the Novo pharmaceutical factory and, in 1955, came the Seven Series. Both matched modern needs perfectly, being light, compact and easily stackable. Two other successful chair designs, the Egg and the Swan, were created for the SAS Royal Hotel which he also designed in 1956.

Jacobsen&#x27;s greatest contribution to the furniture genre came in 1951–52 with his three-legged &quot;Ant &quot;chair which was created for functionality being constructed with laminated veneered plywood housed on of chrome legs that were condensed and stackable for economy of space. 

Other designs were made for Stelton, a company founded by his foster son Peter Holmbl. These include the now classic Cylinda Line stainless steel cocktail kit and tableware.

Other interior design is a line of faucets and accessories for bathroom and kitchen, created after he won a competition in 1961 for his design of the National Bank of Denmark. This classic design is still in production today by Danish company Vola.

==Style and legacy==
According to R. Craig Miller, author of &quot;Design 1935–1989, What Modern was&quot;, Jacobsen&#x27;s work &quot;is an important and original contribution both to modernism and to the specific place Denmark and the Scandinavian countries have in the modern movement&quot; and continues &quot;One might in fact argue that much of what the modern movement stands for, would have been lost and simply forgotten if Scandinavian designers and architects like Arne Jacobsen would not have added that humane element to it&quot;.

Arne Jacobsen is noted for his sense of proportion. Indeed, he himself saw this as one of the main features of his work. In an interview he said; &quot;The proportion is exactly what makes the beautiful ancient Egyptian temples [...] and if we look at some of the most admired buildings of the Renaissance and Baroque, we notice that they were all well-proportioned. Here is the basic thing&quot;.

==In culture and media==
* Arne Jacobsen&#x27;s No. 7 chair is known for being the prop used to hide Christine Keeler&#x27;s nakedness in the iconic photograph of her taken by Lewis Morley in 1963. Morley just happened to use a chair that he had in the studio, which turned out to have been a copy of Jacobsen&#x27;s design. Since then &#x27;Number 7&#x27; chairs have been used for many similar portraits imitating the pose.
* The Seven has featured on the set of the BBC soap opera EastEnders.
* Jacobsen&#x27;s flatware design, with right and left-handed spoons, is used by Stanley Kubrick in his movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. It was selected for the film because of its &#x27;futuristic&#x27; appearance.
* Arne Jacobsen&#x27;s grandson, Tobias Jacobsen, is also a designer for furniture; he created for example the chair &quot;Vio&quot; (according to the elements of a violin) and the sideboard &quot;Boomerang&quot; (named after the curved throw stick).

There are chairs with his design at gate 56A at the San Francisco airport.

<doc id="86772" wikidata="Q17070" url="?curid=86772" title="Réunion">
<text>Réunion (; ; ; known as before 1848) is an island in the Indian Ocean that is an overseas department and region of France. Part of the Mascarene Islands, it is located approximately east of the island of Madagascar and southwest of the island of Mauritius. , it had a population of 896,175. Its capital and largest city is Saint-Denis.

La Réunion was uninhabited until French immigrants and colonial subjects settled the island in the 17th century. Its tropical climate led to the development of a plantation economy focused primarily on sugar; slaves from East Africa were imported as fieldworkers, followed by Malays, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Indians as indentured laborers. Today, the greatest proportion of the population is of mixed descent, while the predominant language is Réunion Creole, though French remains the sole official language.

Since 1946, Réunion has been governed as a French region and thus has a similar status to its counterparts in Metropolitan France. Consequently, it is one of the outermost regions of the European Union and part of the eurozone; it is, along with the French overseas department of Mayotte, one of the two eurozone areas in the Southern Hemisphere. Owing to its strategic location, France maintains a large military presence. 

== Name ==

The French took possession of the island in the 17th century, naming it Isle Bourbon after the House of Bourbon which then ruled France. To break with this name, which was too attached to the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;, the National Convention decided on 23 March 1793 to rename the territory Réunion Island. (&quot;La Réunion&quot;, in French, usually means &quot;meeting&quot; or &quot;assembly&quot; rather than &quot;reunion&quot;. This name was presumably chosen in homage to the meeting of the fédérés of Marseilles and the Paris National Guards that preceded the insurrection of 10 August 1792. No document establishes this and the use of the word &quot;meeting&quot; could have been purely symbolic.)

The island changed its name again in the 19th century: in 1806, under the First Empire, General Decaen named it Isle Bonaparte (after Napoleon), though in 1810 it became Isle Bourbon again. It was eventually renamed Réunion after the fall of the July monarchy by a decree of the provisional government on 7 March 1848.

In accordance with the original spelling and the classical spelling and typographical rules, &quot;la Réunion&quot; was written with a lower case in the article, but during the end of the 20th century the spelling &quot;La Réunion&quot; with a capital letter was developed in many writings to emphasize the integration of the article in the name. This last spelling corresponds to the recommendations of the &quot;Commission nationale de toponymie&quot; and appears in the current Constitution of the French Republic in articles 72-3 and 73.

== History ==
The island has been inhabited since the 17th century, when people from France and Madagascar settled there. Slavery was abolished on 20 December 1848 (a date celebrated yearly on the island), when the Second Republic abolished slavery in the French colonies. However, indentured workers continued to be brought to Réunion from South India, among other places. The island became an overseas department of France in 1946.

=== Early history ===
Not much is known of La Réunion&#x27;s history prior to the arrival of the Portuguese in the early 16th century. Arab traders were familiar with it by the name &quot;Dina Morgabin&quot;, &quot;Western Island&quot; (likely &quot;Daniyah/Dībah Maghribīy&quot;). The island is possibly featured on a map from 1153 AD by Al Sharif el-Edrisi. The island might also have been visited by Swahili or Austronesian (ancient Indonesian–Malaysian) sailors on their journey to the west from the Malay Archipelago to Madagascar.

The first European discovery of the area was made around 1507 by Portuguese explorer Diogo Fernandes Pereira, but the specifics are unclear. The uninhabited island might have been first sighted by the expedition led by Dom Pedro Mascarenhas, who gave his name to the island group around Réunion, the Mascarenes. Réunion itself was dubbed &quot;Santa Apolónia&quot; after a favourite saint, which suggests that the date of the Portuguese discovery could have been 9 February, her feast day. Diogo Lopes de Sequeira is said to have landed on the islands of Réunion and Rodrigues in 1509.

===Isle Bourbon (1642–1793)===
By the early 1600s, nominal Portuguese rule had left Santa Apolónia virtually untouched. The island was then occupied by France and administered from Port Louis, Mauritius. Although the first French claims date from 1638, when and Salomon Goubert visited in June 1638, the island was officially claimed by of France in 1642, when he deported a dozen French mutineers to the island from Madagascar. 
The convicts were returned to France several years later, and in 1649, the island was named Isle Bourbon after the House of Bourbon. Colonisation started in 1665, when the French East India Company sent the first settlers.

The French colonists developed a plantation economy founded on the cultivation of coffee and sugar by use of slave labor. 
From the 17th to the 19th centuries, French colonisation, supplemented by importing Africans, Chinese and Indians as workers, contributed to ethnic diversity in the population. From 1690, most of the non-Europeans on the island were enslaved. 
Of the 80,000 slaves imported to Réunion and Mauritius between 1769 and 1793, 45% was provided by slave traders of the Sakalava people in North West Madagascar, who raided East Africa and the Comoros for slaves, and the rest was provided by Arab slave traders who bought slaves from Portuguese Mozambique and transported them to Réunion via Madagascar.

=== French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1793–1814) ===

On 19 March 1793, during the French Revolution, the island&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;La Réunion&quot; in homage to the meeting of the Federates of Marseille and the National Guards of Paris, during the march on the Tuileries Palace on 10 August 1792, and to erase the name of the Bourbon dynasty.

The abolition of slavery voted by the National Convention on 4 February 1794, was rejected by authorities in Réunion, as well as in Isle de France. A delegation accompanied by military forces, charged with imposing the liberation of slaves, arrived on the island of Bourbon on 18 June 1796, only to be immediately expelled without mercy. There followed a period of unrest and challenges to the power of the metropolis, which no longer had any authority over the two islands. The First Consul of the Republic, Napoleon Bonaparte, maintained slavery there, which was never abolished in practice, with the law of 20 May 1802. On 26 September 1806, the island was renamed Isle Bonaparte and found itself in the front line of the Anglo-French conflict for the control of the Indian Ocean.

Following climatic catastrophes of 1806–1807 (cyclones, floods), coffee cultivation declined rapidly and was replaced by sugar cane, whose demand in France increased, due to France&#x27;s recent loss of Saint-Domingue, and soon of Isle de France. Because of its growth cycle, sugarcane is not affected by cyclones.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the island was invaded by British forces and its governor, General Sainte-Suzanne, was forced to capitulate on 9 July 1810. The island then came under British rule and was under British occupation until the end of the Napoleonic period. The old name of Isle Bourbon was restored in 1810.

=== Colony of Bourbon, then Réunion (1814–1946) ===

Bourbon Island was returned to the French under the Treaty of Paris of 1814. The slave trade openly operated in the colony after French rule was restored, and despite international condemnation Bourbon Island imported 2,000 slaves every month during the 1820s, mostly from the Swahili coast or Quelimane in Portuguese Mozambique. In 1841, Edmond Albius&#x27; discovery of hand-pollination of vanilla flowers enabled the island to soon become the world&#x27;s leading vanilla producer. The cultivation of geranium, whose essence is widely used in perfumery, also took off. From 1838 to 1841, Rear-Admiral Anne Chrétien Louis de Hell was governor of the island. A profound change of society and mentality linked to the events of the last ten years led the governor to present three emancipation projects to the Colonial Council.

On 9 June 1848, after the arrival of news of the French Revolution of 1848 from Europe, governor announced the proclamation of the French Republic in Saint-Denis, and on that same day the island was definitely renamed &quot;Réunion&quot;, the name it had already held between 1793 and 1806. The establishment of the Republic was met with coldness and distrust by the white plantocracy due to the professed abolitionism of the new Republican authorities in Paris. On 18 October 1848, the new Commissioner of the Republic Joseph Napoléon Sébastien Sarda Garriga, sent from Paris to replace Graëb, announced in Saint-Denis the abolition of slavery in Réunion, effective on 20 December 1848 (December 20 has been an official holiday in Réunion since then). Louis Henri Hubert Delisle became its first Creole governor on 8 August 1852, and remained in this position until 8 January 1858.

After abolition, many foreign workers came as indentured workers. Slavery was replaced by a system of contract labor known as &quot;engagés&quot;, which lasted from 1848 until 1864. In practice, an illegal slave trade was conducted in which slaves were acquired from Portuguese Mozambique and Zanzibar and then trafficked to Réunion via the Comoros slave trade. They were officially called &quot;engagés&quot; to avoid the anti-slavery British blockade of Africa.

The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 reduced the importance of the island as a stopover on the East Indies trade route and caused a shift in commercial traffic away from the island. Europe increasingly turned to sugar beet to meet its sugar needs. Despite the development policy of the local authorities and the recourse to compromise, the economic crisis became evident from the 1870s onwards. However, this economic depression did not prevent the modernization of the island, with the development of the road network, the creation of the railroad and the construction of the artificial harbor of the Pointe des Galets. These major construction projects offered a welcome alternative for agricultural workers.
During World War II, Réunion was under the control of Vichy France until 30 November 1942, when Free French forces disembarked from the destroyer &quot;Léopard&quot; and liberated the colony.

=== Modern history (since 1946) ===

La Réunion became a &quot;département d&#x27;outre-mer&quot; (overseas département) of France on 19 March 1946. INSEE assigned to Réunion the department code codice_1, and the region code codice_2 when regional councils were created in 1982 in France, including in existing overseas departments which also became overseas regions.

Over about two decades in the late 20th century (1963–1982), 1,630 children from La Réunion were relocated to rural areas of metropolitan France, particularly to Creuse, ostensibly for education and work opportunities. That programme was led by influential Gaullist politician Michel Debré, who was an MP for La Réunion at the time. Many of these children were abused or disadvantaged by the families with whom they were placed. Known as the Children of Creuse, they and their fate came to light in 2002 when one of them, Jean-Jacques Martial, filed suit against the French state for kidnapping and deportation of a minor. Other similar lawsuits were filed over the following years, but all were dismissed by French courts and finally by the European Court of Human Rights in 2011.

In 2005 and 2006, La Réunion was hit by a crippling epidemic of chikungunya, a disease spread by mosquitoes. According to the BBC News, 255,000 people on La Réunion had contracted the disease as of 26 April 2006. The neighbouring islands of Mauritius and Madagascar also suffered epidemics of this disease during the same year. A few cases also appeared in mainland France, carried by people travelling by airline. The French government of Dominique de Villepin sent an emergency aid package worth €36 million and deployed about 500 troops in an effort to eradicate mosquitoes on the island.

== Politics ==

La Réunion sends seven deputies to the French National Assembly and three senators to the Senate.

=== Status ===
Réunion is an overseas department and region of France (known in French as a &quot;département et région d&#x27;outre-mer&quot;, DROM) governed by article 73 of the Constitution of France, under which the laws and regulations are applicable as of right, as in metropolitan France.

Thus, Réunion has a regional council and a departmental council. These territorial entities have the same general powers as the departments and regions of metropolitan France, albeit with some adaptations. Article 73 of the constitution provides for the possibility of replacing the region and the department by a single territorial entity, but, unlike French Guiana or Martinique, there are currently no plans to do so. Unlike the other DROMs, the constitution explicitly excludes Réunion from the possibility of receiving authorization from Parliament to set certain rules itself, either by law or by the national executive. The state is represented in Réunion by a prefect. The territory is divided into four districts (Saint-Benoît, Saint-Denis, Saint-Paul and Saint-Pierre). Réunion has 24 municipalities organized into 5 agglomeration communities. From the point of view of the European Union, Réunion is considered an &quot;outermost region&quot;.

=== Geopolitics ===
The positioning of La Réunion Island has given it a more or less important strategic role depending on the period.

Already at the time of the India Route or &quot;Route des Indes,&quot; Réunion was a French possession located between Cape Town and the Indian trading posts, although far from the Mozambique Channel. Isle Bourbon (its name under the Ancien Régime) was not, however, the preferred position for trade and military. Governor Labourdonnais claimed that Isle de France was a land of opportunity, thanks to its topography and the presence of two natural harbours. He intended Isle Bourbon to be a depot or an emergency base for Isle de France.

The opening of the Suez Canal diverted much of the maritime traffic from the southern Indian Ocean and reduced the strategic importance of the island. This decline is confirmed by the importance given to Madagascar, which was later colonized.

Today, the island, the seat of a defense and security zone, is the headquarters of the French Armed Forces of the Southern Indian Ocean Zone (FAZSOI), which brings together French Army units stationed in La Réunion and Mayotte. Réunion is also a base for the so-called Frenchelon signal intelligence system, whose infrastructure includes a mobile listening and automatic search unit. Saint-Pierre is also the headquarters of the mostly uninhabited French Southern and Antarctic Lands (&quot;Terres australes et antarctiques françaises&quot;, TAAF). Because of France&#x27;s possession of Réunion, France is a member of the Indian Ocean Commission, which also includes the Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius and the Seychelles.

== Administrative divisions ==

Administratively, La Réunion is divided into 24 &quot;communes&quot; (municipalities) grouped into four &quot;arrondissements&quot;. It is also subdivided into 25 cantons, meaningful only for electoral purposes at the departmental or regional level. It is a French overseas department, hence a French overseas region. The low number of &quot;communes&quot;, compared with French metropolitan departments of similar size and population, is unique: most of its &quot;communes&quot; encompass several localities, sometimes separated by significant distances.

=== Municipalities (&quot;communes&quot;) ===

The &quot;communes&quot; voluntarily grouped themselves into five groups for cooperating in some domains, apart from the four &quot;arrondissements&quot; to which they belong for purposes of national laws and executive regulation. After some changes in their composition, name and status, all of them operate with the status of agglomeration communities, and apply their own local taxation (in addition to national, regional, departmental, and municipal taxes) and have an autonomous budget decided by the assembly representing all member communes. This budget is also partly funded by the state, the region, the department, and the European Union for some development and investment programmes. Every &quot;commune&quot; in Réunion is now a member of such an intercommunality, with its own taxation, to which member communes have delegated their authority in various areas.

== Foreign relations ==
Although diplomacy, military, and French government matters are handled by Paris, La Réunion is a member of La Francophonie, the Indian Ocean Commission, the International Trade Union Confederation, the Universal Postal Union, the Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa, and the World Federation of Trade Unions in its own right.

== Defence ==
The French Armed Forces are responsible for the defence of the department. These forces also contribute to the defence of other French territories in the region, including Mayotte and the French Southern and Antarctic Lands. A total of some 2,000 French troops are deployed in the region, mostly in La Réunion centred on the 2nd Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment. Two CASA CN 235 aircraft, forming air detachment 181 and drawn from the 50th Air Transport squadron, provide a modest air transport and surveillance capability. In 2022, the French Air Force demonstrated a capacity to reinforce the territory by deploying two Rafale fighter aircraft, supported by an A330 MRTT Phénix tanker, from France to Réunion for a regional exercise.

The French naval presence includes two s, and , the icebreaker , the patrol and support ship &quot;Champlain&quot; and the coast guard vessel &quot;Le Malin&quot;. The naval aviation element includes a Eurocopter AS565 Panther helicopter from Flottille 36F able to embark on the &quot;Floréal&quot;-class frigates as required. In 2025, the helicopter is to be replaced by a AS 365N Dauphin. By 2025, &quot;Le Malin&quot; is to be replaced by &quot;Auguste Techer&quot;, a vessel of the new &quot;Félix Éboué&quot; class of patrol vessels. The French Navy will further reinforce its offshore patrol capabilities in the region by deploying a second vessel of the class (&quot;Félix Éboué&quot;) to Réunion by 2026.

About 800 National Gendarmerie, including one mobile squadron and one high mountain platoon, are also stationed in Réunion. The Maritime Gendarmerie has also operated the patrol boat &quot;Verdon&quot; in the territory (though she was reported forward deployed in Mayotte as of 2022).

== Geography ==

The island is long; wide; and covers . It is above a hotspot in the Earth&#x27;s crust. The Piton de la Fournaise, a shield volcano on the eastern end of La Réunion, rises more than above sea level and is sometimes called a sister to Hawaiian volcanoes because of the similarity of climate and volcanic nature. It has erupted more than 100 times since 1640, and is under constant monitoring, most recently erupting on 2 July 2023. During another eruption in April 2007, the lava flow was estimated at per day. The hotspot that fuels Piton de la Fournaise also created the islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues.

The Piton des Neiges volcano, the highest point on the island at above sea level, is northwest of the Piton de la Fournaise. Collapsed calderas and canyons are south west of the mountain. While the Piton de la Fournaise is one of Earth&#x27;s most active volcanoes, the Piton des Neiges is dormant. Its name is French for &quot;peak of snows&quot;, but snowfall on the summit of the mountain is rare. The slopes of both volcanoes are heavily forested. Cultivated land and cities like the capital city of Saint-Denis are concentrated on the surrounding coastal lowlands. Offshore, part of the west coast is characterised by a coral reef system. Réunion also has three calderas: the Cirque de Salazie, the Cirque de Cilaos and the Cirque de Mafate. The last is accessible only on foot or by helicopter.

=== Geology and relief ===
La Réunion is a volcanic island born some three million years ago with the emergence of the Piton des Neiges volcano. It has an altitude of , the highest peak in the Mascarene Islands and the Indian Ocean. The eastern part of the island is constituted by the Piton de la Fournaise, a much more recent volcano (500,000 years old) which is considered one of the most active on the planet. The emerged part of the island represents only a small percentage (about 3%) of the underwater mountain that forms it.

In addition to volcanism, the relief of the island is very uneven due to active erosion. The centre shelters three vast cirques dug by erosion (Salazie, Mafate and Cilaos) and the slopes of the island are furrowed by numerous rivers digging gullies, estimated at least 600, generally deep and whose torrents cut the sides of the mountains up to several hundreds of metres deep.

The ancient massif of the Piton des Neiges is separated from the massif of La Fournaise by a gap formed by the plaine des Palmistes and the plaine des Cafres, a passageway between the east and the south of the island. Apart from the plains, the coastal areas are generally the flattest regions, especially in the north and west of the island. The coastline of the wild south is however steeper.

Between the coastal fringe and the Hauts, there is a steep transitional zone whose gradient varies considerably before arriving at the ridge lines setting the cirques or the Enclos, the caldera of the Piton de la Fournaise.

=== Climate ===

La Réunion is characterized by a humid tropical climate, tempered by the oceanic influence of the trade winds blowing from east to west. The climate of Réunion is characterized by its great variability, mainly due to the imposing relief of the island, which is at the origin of numerous microclimates.

As a result, there are strong disparities in rainfall between the windward coast in the east and the leeward coast in the west, and in temperature between the warmer coastal areas and the relatively cooler highland areas.

In La Réunion there are two distinct seasons, defined by the rainfall regime:

* a rainy season from January to March, during which most of the year&#x27;s rain falls;
* a dry season from May to November. However, in the eastern part and in the foothills of the volcano, rainfall can be significant even in the dry season;

April and December are transition months, sometimes very rainy but also very dry.

Pointe des Trois Bassins, located on the coast of the commune of Trois-Bassins (west), is the driest season, with a normal annual precipitation of , while Le Baril, in Saint-Philippe (southeast), is the wettest coastal season, with a normal annual precipitation of .

However, the wettest station is in the highlands of Sainte-Rose, with an average annual rainfall of almost , making it one of the wettest places in the world.

Temperatures in La Réunion are characterized by their great mildness throughout the year. In fact, the thermal amplitude from one season to another is relatively small (rarely exceeding 10 °C or 18 °F), although it is perceptible:

* In the warm season (November to April): average minimums usually range between , and average maximums between , on the coast. At , average minimums fluctuate between and average maximums between ;
* In the cold season (May to October): temperatures at sea level vary from for average minimums and from for average maximums. At , average minimums range from and average maximums from .

In mountain towns, such as Cilaos or La Plaine-des-Palmistes, average temperatures range between . The highest parts of the habitat and the natural areas at altitude may suffer some winter frosts. Snow was even observed on the Piton des Neiges and Piton de la Fournaise in 2003 and 2006.

The warmest day on record was set on 30 January 2022. In the cold pole of the La Réunion (all-time low ) Gite de Bellecombe ( AMSL) with a maximum temperature of . It beats the previous record of set in 2021.

While a growing number of islands (including &quot;non-sovereign&quot; islands) in the world are concerned about the effects of climate change, the island of Réunion was chosen (along with Gran Canaria in Spain) as an example for a case study of an affected ultra-European peripheral territory, for a study on the adequacy of urban and regional planning tools to the needs and characteristics of these islands (including land use and population density and the regulatory framework).

This work confirmed that urban and peri-urban land use pressures are high, and that adaptation strategies are incompletely integrated into land use planning. According to the Institute of Island Studies, there is a dysfunction: &quot;island planning tools often do not take climate change adaptation into account and there is too much top-down management in the decision-making process&quot;. Réunion holds the world records for the most rainfall in 12-, 24-, 72- and 96-hour periods, including in 24 hours.

=== Beaches ===
La Réunion hosts many beaches. They are often equipped with barbecues, amenities, and parking spaces. Hermitage Beach is the most extensive and best-preserved lagoon in Réunion Island and a popular snorkelling location. It is a white sand beach lined with casuarina trees under which the locals often organise picnics.

At La Plage des Brisants, a surfing spot, many athletic and leisure activities take place. Each November, a film festival is organised there. Movies are projected on a large screen in front of a crowd.

Beaches at Boucan are surrounded by a stretch of restaurants that particularly cater to tourists. L&#x27;Étang-Salé on the west coast is covered in black sand consisting of tiny fragments of basalt. This occurs when lava contacts water, it cools rapidly and shatters into the sand and fragmented debris of various size. Much of the debris is small enough to be considered sand. Grand Anse is a tropical white-sand beach lined with coconut trees in the south of Réunion, with a rock pool built for swimmers, a pétanque playground, and a picnic area. Le Vieux Port in Saint Philippe is a green-sand beach consisting of tiny olivine crystals, formed by the 2007 lava flow, making it one of the youngest beaches on Earth.

== Environment ==
=== Flora ===
The tropical and insular flora of La Réunion Island is characterized by its diversity, a very high rate of endemism and a very specific structure. The flora of La Réunion presents a great diversity of natural environments and species (up to 40 tree species/ha, compared to a temperate forest which has an average of 5/ha). This diversity is even more remarkable, but fragile, as it differs according to the environment (coastal, low, medium and high mountain).

La Réunion has a very high rate of endemic species, with more than 850 native plants (of natural origin and present before the arrival of humans), of which 232 are endemic to the La Réunion (only present on the island), as well as numerous species endemic to the Mascarene archipelago. Finally, the flora of La Réunion is distinguished from that of equatorial tropical forests by the low height and density of the canopy, probably due to adaptation to cyclones, and by a very specific vegetation, in particular a strong presence of epiphytic plants (growing on other plants), such as orchids, bromeliads and cacti, but also ferns, lichens and mosses.

=== Wildlife ===
Like its prodigious floral diversity, Réunion is home to a variety of birds such as the white-tailed tropicbird (). Many of these birds species are endemic to the island, such as the Réunion harrier and Réunion cuckooshrike. Its largest land animal is the panther chameleon, &quot;Furcifer pardalis.&quot; Much of the west coast is ringed by coral reef which harbours, among other animals, sea urchins, conger eels, and parrot fish. Sea turtles and dolphins also inhabit the coastal waters. Humpback whales migrate north to the island from the Antarctic waters annually during the Southern Hemisphere winter (June–September) to breed and feed, and can be routinely observed from the shores of Réunion during this season.

Beekeepers began importing European honey bees during the late 19th century, which in turn have breed with the endemic &quot;Apis mellifera unicolor&quot; subspecies which originated from Madagascar. 97% of the honey bees on the island are descended from &quot;A. m. unicolor&quot;, however their DNA only accounts for 53% of the genetic mixture. In an attempt to prevent the spread of diseases a bee importation ban was imposed in 1982, however in 2017 one or two Varroa destructor mites were brought into the island when a Queen bee was smuggled in by a beekeeper, within 4.5 months the mites had spread throughout the island, causing an increase of annual deaths of colonies from 0.6% to 64%, after initially reaching 85%.

At least 19 species formerly endemic to Réunion have become extinct following human colonisation. For example, the Réunion giant tortoise became extinct after being slaughtered in vast numbers by sailors and settlers of the island.

=== Marine biodiversity ===
Despite the small area of coral reefs, the marine biodiversity of La Réunion is comparable to that of other islands in the area, which has earned the Mascarene archipelago its inclusion among the top ten global biodiversity &quot;hotspots&quot;. Réunion&#x27;s coral reefs, both flat and barrier, are dominated mainly by fast-growing branching coral species of the genus Acropora (family Acroporidae), which provide shelter and food for many tropical species.

Recent scientific research in Réunion Island indicates that there are more than 190 species of corals, more than 1,300 species of mollusks, more than 500 species of crustaceans, more than 130 species of echinoderms and more than 1,000 species of fish.

La Réunion&#x27;s deeper waters are home to dolphins, killer whales, humpback whales, blue sharks and a variety of shark species, including whale sharks, coral sharks, bull sharks, tiger sharks, blacktip sharks and great white sharks. Several species of sea turtles live and breed here.

Between 2010 and 2017, 23 shark attacks occurred in the waters of La Réunion, of which nine were fatal. In July 2013, the Prefect of Réunion Michel Lalande announced a ban on swimming, surfing, and bodyboarding off more than half of the coast. Lalande also said 45 bull sharks and 45 tiger sharks would be culled, in addition to the 20 already killed as part of scientific research into the illness ciguatera.

Migrations of humpback whales contributed to a boom of whale watching industries on Réunion, and watching rules have been governed by the OMAR (Observatoire Marin de la Réunion) and Globice (Groupe local d&#x27;observation et d&#x27;identification des cétacés).

=== Coral reef ===

Because the island is relatively young (3 million years old), the coral formations (8,000 years old) are not well developed and occupy a small area compared to older islands, mostly in the form of fringing reefs.

These formations define shallow &quot;lagoons&quot; (rather &quot;reef depressions&quot;), the largest of which is no more than wide and about deep. These lagoons, which form a discontinuous reef belt long (i.e. 12% of the island&#x27;s coastline) with a total area of , are located on the west and southwest coast of the island. The most important are those of L&#x27;Ermitage (St-Gilles), St-Leu, L&#x27;Étang-Salé and St-Pierre.

=== Management ===
Since 2010, La Réunion is home to a UNESCO World Heritage Site that covers about 40% of the island&#x27;s area and coincides with the central zone of the La Réunion National Park. The island is part of the Mascarene forests terrestrial ecoregion.

==== Gardening and Bourbon roses ====
The first members of the &quot;Bourbon&quot; group of garden roses originated on this island (then still Isle Bourbon, hence the name) from a spontaneous hybridisation between Damask roses and &quot;Rosa chinensis&quot;, which had been brought there by the colonists. The first Bourbon roses were discovered on the island in 1817.

=== Threats to the environment ===
Among coastal ecosystems, coral reefs are among the richest in biodiversity, but they are also the most fragile.

Nearly one-third of fish species were already considered threatened or vulnerable in 2009, with coral degradation in many places. The causes of this state of affairs are pollution, overfishing and poaching, as well as anthropogenic pressure, especially linked to the densification of urbanization in coastal areas and the discharge of sewage.

15 species living on La Réunion were included in the Red List published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

== Demographics ==


=== Historical population ===
=== Major metropolitan areas ===
The most populous metropolitan area is Saint-Denis, which covers six communes (Saint-Denis, Sainte-Marie, La Possession, Sainte-Suzanne, Saint-André, and Bras-Panon) in the north of the island. The three largest metropolitan areas are:

===Migration and ethnic groups===
At the 2019 census, 82.4% of the inhabitants of La Réunion were born on the island, 11.7% were born in Metropolitan France, 1.0% were born in Mayotte, 0.3% were born in the rest of Overseas France, and 4.6% were born in foreign countries (46% of them children of French expatriates and settlers born in foreign countries, such as children of Réunionese settlers born in Madagascar during colonial times; the other 54% immigrants, i.e. people born in foreign countries with no French nationality at birth).

In recent decades, the number of Metropolitan Frenchmen living on the La Réunion has increased markedly: only 5,664 natives of Metropolitan France lived in Réunion at the 1967 census, but their numbers were multiplied by more than six in 23 years, reaching 37,516 at the 1990 census, and then nearly tripled in the next three decades, reaching 100,493 at the 2019 census. Native Réunionese, meanwhile, have emigrated increasingly to Metropolitan France: the number of natives of La Réunion living in Metropolitan France rose from 16,548 at the 1968 census to 92,354 at the 1990 census to 130,662 at the 2019 census, by which date 15.7% of the natives of Réunion lived outside of the department.

La Réunion has received little immigration since World War II, and by the 2019 census only 2.5% of its inhabitants were immigrants. This is in contrast to the situation that prevailed from the middle of the 19th century until World War Two when many migrants from India (especially from Tamil Nadu and Gujarat), Eastern Asia (particularly China), and Africa came to La Réunion to work in the plantation economy. Their descendants have now become French citizens.

Ethnic groups present include people of African, Indian, European, Malagasy and Chinese origin. Local names for these are Yabs, Cafres, Malbars and Chinois. All of the ethnic groups on the island are immigrant populations that have come to Réunion from Europe, Asia and Africa over the centuries. These populations have mixed from the earliest days of the island&#x27;s colonial history (the first settlers married women from Madagascar and of Indo-Portuguese heritage), resulting in a majority population of mixed race and of &quot;Creole&quot; culture.

It is not known exactly how many people of each ethnicity live in La Réunion, since the French census does not ask questions about ethnic origin, which applies in La Réunion because it is a part of France in accordance with the 1958 constitution. The extent of racial mixing on the island also makes ethnic estimates difficult. According to estimates, Whites make up roughly one quarter of the population, Malbars make up more than 25% of the population and people of Chinese ancestry form roughly 3%. The percentages for those of African and mixed-race origins vary widely in estimates. Also, some people of Vietnamese ancestry live on the island, though they are very few in number.

Tamils are the largest group among the Indian community. The island&#x27;s community of Muslims from northwestern India, particularly Gujarat, and elsewhere is commonly referred to as &quot;zarabes&quot;.

Creoles (a name given to those born on the island, regardless of ethnic origins) make up the majority of the population. Groups that are not Creole include people recently arrived from Metropolitan France (known as &quot;zoreilles&quot;) and those from Mayotte and the Comoros as well as immigrants from Madagascar and Sri Lankan Tamil refugees.

== Religion ==


The predominant religion is Christianity. The Catholic Church has a single jurisdiction, the Diocese of Saint-Denis-de-La Réunion. Religious Intelligence estimates Christians to be 84.9% of the population, followed by Hindus (10%) and Muslims (2.15%). Chinese folk religion and Buddhism are also represented.

Most large towns have a Hindu temple and a mosque.

===Ritual===
&quot;See also&quot;: 

There are traditional Réunionnais ceremonial practices (, or ) of ancestor veneration arising from Malagasy roots, blended with Malabar, Comorian, European, and Chinese cultural influences. These may be practised by those adhering to the main religions of Christianity, Hinduism and Islam.

== Culture ==

Réunionese culture is a blend () of European, African, Indian, Chinese and insular traditions. The most widely spoken language, Réunion Creole, derives from French.

=== Language ===
French is the sole official language of Réunion. Though not official, Réunion Creole is widely spoken alongside French. Creole is commonly used for informal purposes, whereas the official language for administrative purposes, as well as education, is French.

Other languages spoken on La Réunion include: Comorian varieties (especially Shimaore) and Malagasy, by recent immigrants from Mayotte and Madagascar; Mandarin, Hakka and Cantonese by members of the Chinese community; Indian languages, mostly Tamil, Gujarati and Hindi; and Arabic, spoken by a small community of Muslims. These languages are generally spoken by immigrants, as those born on the island tend to use French and Creole.

Cantonese, Arabic and Tamil are offered as optional languages in some schools.

=== Music and dance ===

Two forms make up the musical tradition of Réunion Island. One, the sega, is a Creole variant of the quadrille, the other, the maloya, like the American blues, comes from Africa, carried by the nostalgia and pain of enslaved people uprooted and deported from their homeland. Sega is present on other islands, while maloya is traditional only in Réunion.

The sega is a disguised ballroom dance to the rhythm of traditional Western instruments (accordion, harmonica, guitar, etc.), and stems from the wider colonial society at the time. It is still the typical ballroom dance of the islands of Réunion, Rodrigues, Seychelles, and the Mascarene archipelago in general. Mauritian sega and Rhodesian sega also continue.

The slaves&#x27; maloya, a ritual dance full of melodies and gestures, was performed, often clandestinely, at night around a bonfire; the few instruments that accompanied it were made of plants (bamboo, gourds, etc.). Performance was often an underground activity on plantations as slaveholders disapproved of this cultural expression by the enslaved. From the 1960s, it was suppressed by the French government who feared its association with Réunionnais pro-autonomy movements and with communism. The sometimes controversial lyrics reminded France of its slave-owning past and underlined the damage this colonial era did to human beings; in the course of the island&#x27;s history, Maloya artists and (; gatherings) were banned by authorities. Maloya troupes continued to perform in the face of official repression: along with their artistic expression, they wanted to perpetuate the memory of the slaves, their suffering and their uprooting. The French government&#x27;s attitude to Maloya did not alter until 1981, when François Mitterrand became president.

Every 20 December, the inhabitants of La Réunion celebrate . This celebration, also known as the (or in , also, ), commemorates the proclamation of the final abolition of slavery by governor Joseph Sarda for the French Second Republic in 1848. Numerous concerts are organized, most of them free, as well as costume parades and dance shows such as merengue, for example.

With the institution of a public holiday to celebrate the abolition of slavery, maloya has received official and wider cultural recognition; it is regularly played on public radio and in many discotheques and dance parties. A revival of maloya, beginning in the 1970s and particularly identified with musician Danyèl Waro, a protégé of Firmin Viry, raised its cultural status. Groups began to make modern versions, styles and arrangements, such as maloggae and other electric maloya.

Some of Réunion&#x27;s emblematic maloya artists and groups include: Groupe folklorique de La Réunion; Kalou Pilé; Baster; Ousanousava; Ziskakan; Pat&#x27;Jaune; Danyèl Waro; and Tisours. One of the most revered Maloya singers was . Born in Sainte-Suzanne, he was one of the first to sing Maloya. When he died in 2004, many people were present at his funeral.

In 2008, the artist and musician made a video entitled &quot;La Réunion&quot;. In this clip, we see him crossing all the landscapes of the island.

In the field of contemporary dance, the choreographer Pascal Montrouge, who directs the only company in France that has a double headquarters in Saint-Denis de La Réunion and Hyères, which reinforces the sense of his vision of identity. In 2007, the city of Saint-Denis de La Réunion entrusted him with the artistic direction of its Saint-Denis Danses festival.

The island is home to the regional conservatory of La Réunion, which has four teaching centres and was created in 1987 under the impetus of the then president of the region, Pierre Lagourgue. Today, although traditional dances are not forgotten in the conservatoires (which teach dance, music and theatre), the dances taught are classical dance, contemporary dance and Bharata natyam dance. These students regularly have the opportunity to dance with choreographers from Réunion such as Didier Boutiana cie &quot;Konpani Soul city&quot;, Soraya Thomas cie &quot;Morphose&quot; or Éric Languet cie &quot;Danse en l&#x27;R&quot;. These different local companies allow the inhabitants of Réunion to dance professionally.

Urban culture has also made its appearance, following the trends and influences of metropolitan France and the United States. Thus, hip-hop culture is developing, but also ragga dancehall, with KM David or Kaf Malbar being the figurehead of this new movement, influencing the young generation all over the island, with their songs spread by mp3 or internet. Many young artists are trying to &quot;break through&quot; in this music, whose industry is developing reasonably well, locally but also internationally, and has nothing to envy from the precursors of French dancehall.

=== Cuisine ===

Always accompanied by rice, the most common dishes are carry (sometimes spelled cari), a local version of Indian curry, and civets (stews). Curry is made with a base of onion, garlic and spices such as turmeric (called &quot;safran péi&quot; on the island), on which fish, meat and eggs are fried; tomato is then added. Dishes can also be flavoured with ginger; the peel of a combava is often prized. Chop suey (with rice, not pasta) and other Asian dishes such as pork with pineapple

Some examples of popular réunionese dishes include:
*Achards (inspired by achaar)
*Cabri massalé
*Cari poulet
*Rougail dakatine
*Rougail morue
*Rougail saucisse
*Bouchon

In general, there are few dishes without meat or fish, so there are few vegetarian options. One of them is chouchou chayote gratin. Otherwise, mainly poultry is consumed. One of the local specialties is tangue civet (of the hedgehog family).

===Sport===
Moringue is a popular combat/dance sport similar to capoeira. There are several famous Réunionese sportsmen and women like the handballer Jackson Richardson, as well as the karateka Lucie Ignace. La Réunion has a number of contributions to worldwide professional surfing. It has been home to notable pro surfers including Jeremy Flores, Johanne Defay and Justine Mauvin. Famous break St Leu has been host to several world surfing championship competitions. Since 1992, Réunion has hosted a number of ultramarathons under the umbrella name of the Grand Raid. As of 2018, four different races compose the Grand Raid: the Diagonale des Fous, The Trail de Bourbon, the Mascareignes, and the Zembrocal Trail. Annual athletics &quot;Meeting de la Réunion&quot; is held at the Stade Paul Julius Bénard by the governing body &quot;Ligue Réunionnaise d&#x27;athlétisme&quot;.

==== Football ====
Football (soccer) is the most popular sport. With more than 30,000 licensed players for a population exceeding 850,000 inhabitants, it remains the sport of choice for young people. Although the highest level of competition called the First Division of Réunion is equivalent to a division d&#x27;honneur in metropolitan France (DH), all the youngsters hope to play at the highest level one day.

This has been the case for players such as Laurent Robert, Florent Sinama-Pongolle, Guillaume Hoarau, Dimitri Payet, Benoit Tremoulinas, Melvine Malard (the only six Reunionese to have played for the French national team), Bertrand Robert, Thomas Fontaine, Ludovic Ajorque, Fabrice Abriel (of La Réunion descent) and Wilfried Moimbe (of Réunion descent), to name but a few. The territory has its own team, the Réunion national football team.

=== Architecture ===

Structurally, the local Creole house is said to be symmetrical. In fact, in the absence of an architect, workers would draw a line on the ground and build two identical parts on each side, resulting in houses of essentially rectangular shape. The veranda is an important element of the house. It is an outdoor terrace built on the front of the house, as it allowed to show its richness to the street. A Creole garden completes the house. It is composed of local plants, found in the forest. There is usually a greenhouse with orchids, anthuriums and different types of ferns.

The Villa Déramond-Barre is a Creole architectural model of great heritage interest.

=== Traditions ===

== Media ==
=== Broadcasting ===
Réunion has a local public television channel, Réunion 1ère, which now forms part of France Télévision, and also receives France 2, France 3, France 4, France 5 and France 24 from metropolitan France, as well as France Ô, which shows programming from all of the overseas departments and territories. There are also two local private channels, Télé Kréol and Antenne Réunion.

It has a local public radio station, formerly Radio Réunion, but now known as Réunion 1ère, like its television counterpart. It also receives the Radio France networks France Inter, France Musique and France Culture. The first private local radio station, Radio Freedom, was introduced in 1981. They broadcast daily content about weather and local services.
=== Newspapers ===
There were three daily newspapers published locally. In 2024, one closed. Of the remaining two, one is now produced online only. There are otherweekly and monthlypublications in Réunion, including general interest and television magazines.

The dailies:
*&quot;Journal de l&#x27;île de La Réunion&quot;, founded in 1951, it closed in 2024 after being placed into bankruptcy (&quot;judicial liquidation&quot;) on July 31.
*&quot;&quot;, founded 1976
* , founded 1944; online only since 2013

=== Cinema ===
Present on the island since 1896, is marked by its insularity and its geographical distance from metropolitan France. In the absence of the Centre national de la cinématographie (CNC), it has developed specific distribution and dissemination networks. Its landscapes first served as a natural backdrop for many film and television productions, and film events, such as festivals, multiplied there. Digital technology now facilitates the development of local productions, most of which reflect the particularities of a multicultural and multilingual society.

The Réunion Film festival (festival du film de La Réunion) was created in 2005 and is chaired by Fabienne Redt. The festival presented first and second feature films by French directors. The 10th and last edition took place in 2014 in partnership mainly with the TEAT Champ Fleuri (Saint-Denis) and the city of Saint-Paul.

In the Port, the International Film Festival of Africa and the La Réunion Islands (Festival international du film d&#x27;Afrique et des îles de La Réunion) was also held.

Among the existing film festivals is the Réunion Island Adventure Film Festival (13 editions), which awards prizes to adventure films.

In Saint-Philippe, the Festival Même pas peur, Réunion&#x27;s international fantasy film festival, has been held since 2010.

In Saint-Pierre, there are two festivals: Écran jeunes (25th edition in 2019) and the Festival du Film Court de Saint-Pierre, directed by Armand Dauphin (3rd edition in 2019).

=== Blogs ===
*&quot;Reunion Island Tourism blog&quot; (English/French tourism blog)
*&quot;Visit Reunion&quot; (English language blog and Instagram page)

=== Internet ===
The internet situation in Réunion was once marked by its insularity and remoteness from mainland France, which caused some technological delays. Today, the trend has been reversed and the region has a relatively efficient internet connection and is one of the departments most connected by fibre optics in France.

Internet connection can be provided by ADSL (offered by four operators), fibre optic (three operators), or by cellular data on 4G and 5G networks (currently being tested in Saint-Denis).

Réunion domain names have the suffix .re. The La Réunion region has deployed a regional fibre-optic network for operators. This network is based partly on EDF&#x27;s very high voltage cables - G@zelle network, partly on the region&#x27;s own fibre and partly on Hertzian links for the most isolated areas. This network is managed by a public service company called La Réunion Numérique.

== Economy ==

In 2019, the GDP of Réunion at market exchange rates, not at PPP, was estimated at 19.5 billion euros (US$21.8 bn) and the GDP per capita (also at market exchange rates) was 22,629 euros (US$25,333), the highest in sub-Saharan Africa, but only 61.7% of metropolitan France&#x27;s GDP per capita that year, and 73.5% of the metropolitan French regions outside the Paris Region.

Before the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, the economy of La Réunion was in a process of catching up with the rest of France. From 1997 to 2007, the economy of La Réunion grew by an average of +4.6% per year in real terms, and the GDP per capita rose from 53.7% of metropolitan France&#x27;s level in 2000 to 61.6% of metropolitan France in 2007. The Great Recession that followed the financial crisis greatly affected La Réunion whose economy came to a standstill in 2008, then experienced two years of recession in 2009 and 2010, followed by three years of stagnation (2011–2013). By 2013, the GDP per capita of Réunion had fallen back to 60.6% of metropolitan France&#x27;s level.

Economic growth returned in 2014. The economy grew by an average of +2.9% per year in real terms from 2014 to 2017, and the GDP per capita of Réunion rose to 62.4% of metropolitan France&#x27;s GDP per capita by 2017, its highest level ever. The economy slowed down in 2018, growing at only +1.7% due in part to the yellow vests protests which paralyzed the Réunionese economy in the end of 2018, before recovering to +2.2% in 2019. As a result of this slower growth since 2018, the GDP per capita of Réunion fell back slightly compared to metropolitan France&#x27;s, standing at 61.7% of metropolitan France&#x27;s level in 2019.

Réunion was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, leading to a massive recession of -4.2% that year according to provisional estimates, the largest on record, although less severe than in metropolitan France (-7.9% for metropolitan France in 2020).

Sugar was traditionally the chief agricultural product and export. Tourism is now an important source of income. The island&#x27;s remote location combined with its stable political alignment with Europe makes it a key location for satellite receiving stations and naval navigation.

GDP sector composition in 2017 (contribution of each sector to the total gross value added):

Unemployment is a major problem on Réunion, although the situation has improved markedly since the beginning of the 2000s: the unemployment rate, which stood above 30% from the early 1980s to the early 2000s, declined to 24.6% in 2007, then rebounded to 30.0% in 2011 due to the 2008 global financial crisis and subsequent Great Recession, but declined again after 2011, reaching 19.0% in 2023, its lowest level in 45 years.

In 2021, 36.1% of the population lived below the poverty line (defined by INSEE as 60% of Metropolitan France&#x27;s median income; in 2021 the poverty line for a family of two parents and two young children was €2,423 (US$2,868) per month), a marked decrease compared to 2013 when 49% of the population lived below the poverty line.

The tertiary sector, particularly the commercial sector, is by far the most developed, and import distribution has taken off in the mid-1980s through affiliation and franchising agreements with metropolitan groups. The advent of franchised distribution has transformed the commercial apparatus, which historically was characterized by the geographic dispersion of small grocery-type units; the few &quot;Chinese stores&quot; still in operation are limited to mid-range towns and, as relics of a bygone era, have more of a tourist and educational appeal, even if they retain a convenience store function.

Rum distillation contributes to the island&#x27;s economy. A &quot;Product of France&quot;, it is shipped to Europe for bottling, then shipped to consumers around the world.

Brasseries de Bourbon is the main brewery of the island, with Heineken as shareholder.

=== Tourism ===

Income from tourism is La Réunion&#x27;s primary economic resource, ahead of sugarcane production and processing, which has allowed the development of large Réunionese groups such as Quartier Français, Groupe Bourbon ex-Sucreries Bourbon, a large international company now listed on the stock exchange, but based outside the island and which has abandoned the sugar sector for the off-shore maritime sector. With the reduction of subsidies, this culture is threatened. Therefore, the development of fishing in the French Southern Territories has been promoted.

=== Agriculture ===
Agriculture in Réunion is an important activity in the island&#x27;s economy: the agricultural territory covering 20% of the island&#x27;s surface area employs 10% of the active population, generates 5% of the gross regional product and provides the island&#x27;s main export. Formerly centred on coffee and clove cultivation, it has focused on sugar cane since the events of the early 19th century, namely the Great Avalanches and the seizure of Réunion by the British. Today it faces important issues related to the decisions of the World Trade Organization at the international level and the development of the urban fact at the local level.

Réunion Island has about 7,000 farms, 5,000 of which are professional. These farms mobilize almost 11,000 AWU (annual workload of one person on a full-time basis).

Ninety-seven percent of the farms in Réunion are less than 20 hectares in size, compared to an average of 78 hectares in mainland France.

The most common status is that of individual farmer (97%).

In 2005, more than 60% of farm managers were between 40 and 59 years old.

== Public services ==
=== Health ===
In 2005–2006, Réunion experienced an epidemic of chikungunya, a viral disease similar to dengue fever brought in from East Africa, which infected almost a third of the population because of its transmission through mosquitoes. The epidemic has since been eradicated. See the History section for more details.
=== Transport ===
Roland Garros Airport serves the island, handling flights to mainland France, Madagascar, Mauritius, Tanzania, Comoros, Seychelles, South Africa, China and Thailand. Pierrefonds Airport, a smaller airport, has some flights to Mauritius and Madagascar. In 2019 a light rail system was proposed to link Le Barachois with the airport.

=== Education ===
Réunion Island has its own education system. Chantal Manès-Bonnisseau, Inspector General of Education, Sport and Research, was appointed Rector of the Académie de La Réunion and Chancellor of Universities at the Council of Ministers on 29 July 2020.

She succeeds Vêlayoudom Marimoutou, who took office as secretary general of the Indian Ocean Commission on 16 July.

The Rectorate is located in the main city, in the Moufia district of Saint-Denis. At the start of the 2012 school year, the island had 522 pre-school or primary schools, including 26 private schools, for 120,230 students at the primary level, 82 secondary schools, including six private schools, for 61,300 students, 32 general and technological high schools, including three private schools, for 23,650 students, and 15 vocational schools, including two private schools, for 16,200 students.

Réunion&#x27;s priority education zones affect slightly more than half of the primary and secondary school students.

Baccalaureate results are relatively close to the national average with a rate of 81.4% in 2012 compared to 82.4% in 2011 (respectively: 84.5% and 85.6% in the national average).

In higher education, the University of La Réunion has 11,600 students spread across the various sites, especially in Saint-Denis and Le Tampon. A further 5,800 students are divided between the post-baccalaureate courses of secondary education and other higher studies.

=== Energy ===

Energy on Réunion depends on oil and is limited by the island&#x27;s insularity, which forces it to produce electricity locally and import fossil fuels. Faced with increasing demand and environmental requirements, the energy produced on the island is tending to increasingly exploit its great renewable energy potential through the development of wind farms, solar farms and other experimental projects. Although 35% of La Réunion&#x27;s electricity came from renewable sources in 2013, the department&#x27;s energy dependency rate exceeds 85%. Saving electricity and optimising energy efficiency are two major areas of work for the authorities responsible for energy issues.

==== Hydroelectric power ====
Due to the large volumes of rainfall, the flow of surface water allows the installation of hydroelectric infrastructures, especially as erosion has carved out narrow and very deep ravines. The Sainte-Rose plant (22 MW) and the Takamaka plant (17.5 MW) are the two largest. In total, the island&#x27;s six hydroelectric infrastructures have a capacity of 133 MW.

== Symbols ==
La Réunion has no official coat of arms or flag.

Former Governor Merwart created a coat of arms for the island on the occasion of the 1925 colonial exhibition organised on Petite-Île. Merwart, a member of the Réunion Island Society of Sciences and Arts, wanted to include the island&#x27;s history:

* the bees evoke the Empire;
* the central coat of arms evokes the French Republican flag;
* the fleurs-de-lis evoke the royal era;
* The motto &quot;Florebo quocumque ferar&quot; is that of the French East India Company and means &quot;I will bloom wherever they take me&quot;, while the vanilla vines honour a flourishing harvest.
* The Roman numeral &quot;MMM&quot; evokes the altitude of the highest peaks;
* the ship Saint-Alexis is the one that first took possession of the island;

<text>Matinée de Septembre (English: September Morn) is a controversial oil painting on canvas completed in 1911 by the French artist Paul Émile Chabas. Painted over several summers, it depicts a nude girl or young woman standing in the shallow water of a lake, prominently lit by the morning sun. She is leaning slightly forward in an ambiguous posture, which has been read variously as a straightforward portrayal of protecting her modesty, huddling against the cold, or sponge bathing. It has also been considered a disingenuous pose permitting the &quot;fetishisation of innocence&quot;.

&quot;September Morn&quot; was first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1912, and although the identity of its first owner is unclear, it is certain that Leon Mantashev acquired the painting by the end of 1913. It was taken to Russia, and in the aftermath of the October Revolution of 1917 was feared lost. It resurfaced in 1935 in the collection of Calouste Gulbenkian, and after his death in 1955 was sold to a Philadelphia broker, who donated it anonymously to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (the Met) in 1957. it is not on display.

From 1913 on, reproductions of the painting caused controversy in the United States. An art dealer in Chicago was charged with indecency and another in New York was targeted by anti-vice crusader Anthony Comstock, both after displaying &quot;September Morn&quot;. Over the next few years the work was reproduced in a variety of forms, including on pins and calendars, while censorship and art were debated in newspapers. Chabas&#x27; painting inspired songs, stage shows and films; eventually some 7 million reproductions were sold, though Chabas – who had not copyrighted &quot;September Morn&quot; – did not receive any royalties.

Although several women claimed to be the model for &quot;September Morn&quot;, Chabas never revealed her identity. He described the work as &quot;all I know of painting&quot;, and responded positively to statements that it was his masterpiece. Later writers, however, have described the painting as kitsch, valuable only as a historic artifact.
==Description==

&quot;September Morn&quot; depicts, from an oblique point of view, a naked blonde girl or young woman standing ankle-deep in the water near the shoreline of a tranquil lake surrounded by hills. The figure is backlit by the morning sun, but fully visible, if a little darker than her surroundings. Her arms are folded about her body, her right arm passing below her breasts as she grasps her left elbow, while her left arm conceals her pubic area. This pose has been variously interpreted as the subject protecting herself from the cold, covering her modesty, or sponge bathing, or as the artist&#x27;s &quot;fetishisation of innocence&quot;.

Reviews in 1912 noted that the painting was dominated by grays: those of her shaded body, the blue-grays of the September water, the green-grays of the sky, and the pink-grays of the hills behind her. The art critic François Thiébault-Sisson described this as evoking the morning, the young subject preparing to bathe while &quot;light grey vapours are still floating over the lake&quot;. This oil painting on canvas measures , and Chabas&#x27;s signature is located in the lower left.

==Background==

===Chabas===
By the time he painted &quot;September Morn&quot;, Paul Émile Chabas (1869–1937) already had an established reputation as an academic artist. He regularly submitted to the Paris Salon, first participating in 1886. He won a third class medal in the Salon of 1895, and four years later won the Prix National for his painting &quot;Joyeux ébats&quot;, which earned him a gold medal at the 1900 Exposition Universelle and was acquired by the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes. In subsequent years Chabas spent the winters working in Paris, while he passed his summers painting young women along the shores of rivers, lakes, and seas. In 1902 he was made a Chevalier in the Legion of Honour.

Chabas studied under artists such as Tony Robert-Fleury, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and Albert Maignan. Although his earlier works were generally portraits, most of the painter&#x27;s later production consisted of nude girls and young women. The lakes and rivers of France were common settings for his paintings, which gave prominence to the interaction of light with the models and their surroundings. &quot;September Morn&quot; is typical of his style.

J. Valmy-Baysse, in a 1910 overview of the artist, attributes Chabas&#x27;s style to the painter&#x27;s time at the family summer home along the Erdre; he identifies the &quot;grace of adolescence, its undefinable charm, [and] its chaste nudity&quot; of the models with Chabas&#x27;s reminiscences of his youth. The art historian Bram Dijkstra has argued otherwise, stating that &quot;no artist was more assiduous in exploiting the prurient possibilities of the woman-child&quot; than Chabas, whom he considers to have &quot;emphasized analogies of nude little girls and the familiar poses of vanity or physical arousal given to adult women&quot;.

===Nudity and art===

Female nudes were the dominant subject of painting in French Salons at the end of the 19th century. Female models had become more common than male ones beginning in the early 19th century, first serving allegorical roles or as muses, but eventually becoming individuals &quot;who could be classified and whose history could be written&quot;. In academic art – such as that of Chabas – the models were not portrayed as they were, but as idealized nudes, based on classical ideals; the body hair of women models, for instance, would not be shown, and the pubic area was rendered smoothly. The hostess Suzanne Delve, who later claimed to have stood for &quot;September Morn&quot;, said that models were willing to provide &quot;service to art&quot; by posing nude for such works.

Not all forms of nude imagery were acceptable in France. The end of the 19th century had seen the introduction of various laws against pornography, images of adults and children meant to &quot;provoke, incite, or stimulate debauchery&quot;. Works targeted were initially those meant for wide distribution (and thus, the lower class). However, the Australian art historian Fae Brauer writes that the line between art and pornography was blurred by the early 1910s; even tighter laws, introduced in 1908, had resulted in censorship of modernist works. For instance, three paintings by Kees van Dongen (including two of his daughter) were rejected from the Salon d&#x27;Automne between 1911 and 1913 on grounds of indecency.

The United States had, since colonial times, generally been more puritan in terms of art than Europe. In the mid- and late-19th century the country&#x27;s government implemented laws against obscenity, such as the Tariff of 1842 which banned the importing of foreign works of art deemed obscene. By the end of the 19th century, an uneasy understanding had been reached: museums could hold works depicting nudity, but commercial works (including photographs of artwork) could be – and were – confiscated. Tensions remained over the issue of whether nudes represented European-style sophistication (a trait important to the upper-class) or encouraged behaviors which threatened families and encouraged &quot;impure imaginations&quot;.

==Creation; identity of model==
Chabas began work on &quot;September Morn&quot; in mid-1910 at Talloires on the shores of Lake Annecy in Haute-Savoie, some south-east of Paris. The model, whom he never identified but referred to as &quot;Marthe&quot;, was well known to his family. Owing to the financial situation of the sixteen-year-old&#x27;s family, &quot;Marthe&quot; had to work to support her mother. On the first day of painting, &quot;Marthe&quot; entered the morning water and instinctively recoiled at its chilliness. Chabas approved of this pose, saying that it was &quot;perfect&quot;. Over the course of two summers he worked on the painting, half an hour every morning. The work was completed on a September morning in 1911, giving the painting its name. In 1935, responding to claims that &quot;Marthe&quot; was living in poverty, Chabas explained that she had continued posing for him until she was 28, when she married a rich industrialist, and that she was now aged 41, plump, and had three children.

Numerous women have claimed or been claimed to be the model, some presenting different versions of events. In 1913, a Miss Louise Buckley, performing in Eugene, Oregon, said that she had been paid $1,000 and posed in the artist&#x27;s studio. The Paris-based artist Jules Pages, meanwhile, stated that the woman depicted in &quot;September Morn&quot; had been a 25-year-old of good character who earned her living as an artist&#x27;s model, but had gone into hiding after the controversy over the painting. Other claimants included a Swedish model named Gloria and a variety actress named Irene Shannon; the latter made the claim in the lead-up to a vaudeville skit called &quot;November Mourning&quot;.
In 1937, twenty-four years after &quot;September Morn&quot; caused controversy in the United States, the Parisian hostess Suzanne Delve declared that she had been the model. In her account, Chabas – who had known her since she was an infant – had her pose nude in his studio and later painted Lake Annecy in her absence. Delve described her nervousness at the first session, her mother chatting to her to distract her mind while Chabas&#x27;s wife played soothing music on the piano. She said she took her pose &quot;instinctively&quot; and that the controversy over the painting had ruined her life, as no Frenchman would want to marry a woman marred by scandal.

Yet another version is presented by the Metropolitan Museum of Art (the Met) in their 1966 catalogue of French holdings, including &quot;September Morn&quot;. According to this telling, Chabas completed the painting over three summers at Lake Annecy, though his peasant model served only as the basis for the figure&#x27;s body. The head was based on a sketch of a young American, Julie Phillips, which Chabas had completed upon observing her and her mother dining in Paris; finding her profile to his liking, he silently drew her, then introduced himself and &quot;apologized for his presumption&quot;.

==History==

===Paris Salon and first sale===
Chabas first exhibited &quot;September Morn&quot; in the Paris Salon of April 14 to June 30, 1912. Because he did not plan to sell it, he gave a price of 50,000 francs ($10,000) – more than he expected anybody to pay. For the painting, and his &quot;Portrait of Mme. Aston Knight&quot;, Chabas won a Medal of Honor, receiving 220 of 359 possible votes. At the Salon, the painting was uncontroversial, and it was soon reprinted in American publications such as &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; and &quot;The International Studio&quot;.

Sources are unclear as to the painting&#x27;s provenance after the Salon. According to the Met, the New York-based Philip (or Philippe) Ortiz, manager of the New York Branch of Braun and Company, purchased it in late 1912. According to a 1933 report in the &quot;Middletown Times Herald&quot;, he paid 12,000 francs ($2,400) for the work, but never brought the painting back to the United States. However, Brauer suggests that Ortiz sent it to his gallery in New York, where it caused a controversy. According to &quot;Time&quot;, the painting was acquired by Leon Mantashev  1913, after the painting was returned to Chabas.

A 1935 article in the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;, meanwhile, stated that the original &quot;September Morn&quot; had yet to go to the United States, and that Chabas had sold it directly to Mantashev. According to Chabas, this was after an American approached him to purchase the painting, but was unwilling to pay the asking price. In her memoirs, &quot;Vogue&quot; editor Edna Woolman Chase recounted how Ortiz had arranged for numerous reproductions to be made and sent to New York, and that – although he had been interested in acquiring the original – he had been unable to do so. Although it is possible that the original did not cross the Atlantic by 1913, it is clear that reproductions did.

===Controversy and popularity===

====Chicago====

A full-size reproduction of &quot;September Morn&quot; was displayed in a window of Jackson and Semmelmeyer, a photography shop in Chicago, Illinois, in March 1913. A passing police officer noticed the print and on grounds that it was indecent, insisted it be taken down. The mayor of the city, Carter Harrison IV, agreed with the policeman&#x27;s decision, and deemed that the image could be sold, but should not be displayed in public as children could see it. Fred Jackson, the owner, was charged with indecency, and at his request the case was brought to trial on March 18.

In front of a jury, the city&#x27;s art censor Jeremiah O&#x27;Connor testified that &quot;September Morn&quot; was lewd and should not be displayed in public, but rather only in a museum exhibition. W. W. Hallam of the Chicago Vice Committee agreed, arguing that, as the woman was committing the illegal act of bathing in public, &quot;September Morn&quot; had to be banned. Other witnesses for the prosecution included censors, educators, and clergy, such as the superintendent Ella Flagg Young and the head of the Juvenile Protective Association Gertrude Howe Britton.

Jackson, acting as his own lawyer, highlighted the hypocrisy of censoring the painting while a nude statue of Diana stood in front of the Montgomery Ward Building. He called upon painters, poets, and sculptors as his witnesses, including the artist Oliver Grover and the art critic Walter Smith. In his testimony, Grover stated &quot;A nude woman is no more
indecent than a bare tree. Men and women weren&#x27;t born with overcoats on. Anyhow, indecency may be decidedly apart from nudity.&quot;

After less than an hour of deliberations, the jury found for Jackson, allowing him to reinstate the image in his display; Jackson was so pleased that he promised a free copy of &quot;September Morn&quot; to each juror. Ten days after the trial Mayor Harrison went to the city council and proposed stricter obscenity laws. The city government agreed, and imposed a $25–100 fine for displaying nude art along public roads and in places frequented by children. By September Jackson (together with fellow art dealers Samuel Meyer and William Kuhl) had been found in violation of this law. Mayor Harrison later stated that he was &quot;through&quot; with the painting, saying &quot;Chicago has been made the laughing stock of the whole country because of this bathing girl picture&quot;.

====New York====

Further controversy arose in New York in May 1913, two months after the conclusion of the Chicago trial. Anthony Comstock, head of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice and nationally recognized for his campaigns against &quot;smut&quot;, saw &quot;September Morn&quot; – sources differ as to whether it was the original or a print  – on display in the window of Braun and Company, an art dealership on West 46th Street. Rushing inside, he raged &quot;There&#x27;s too little morn and too much maid! Take it out!&quot;. A clerk, James Kelly, removed the work, but Ortiz, the gallery&#x27;s manager, reinstated it in the window after returning from his lunch break.

Comstock threatened Ortiz with legal action, and the manager – unaware that Comstock could not arrest him, and fearful that he could cause trouble for the gallery – was initially frightened. He consulted with Arthur Brisbane of the &quot;New York Evening Journal&quot;, who told him he had nothing to fear, and sent some reporters to cover the story. The following day, the controversy was highly covered in the press, who hailed Ortiz as &quot;one art expert with the courage to stand up against Comstock and his dictatorship&quot;. Following Comstock&#x27;s visit large crowds blocked the street outside Braun and Company, ogling &quot;September Morn&quot;. The gallery owner refused to sell his large print of &quot;September Morn&quot;, so that it could remain in his window.

After two weeks, when the dealership had sold every print it had, Ortiz removed the display. In a letter to the editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he accused Comstock of causing the controversy to earn greater publicity for himself, and stated that he wearied of crowds outside his shop, who blocked paying customers from entering it. Ultimately, Comstock did not pursue legal action. The historian Walter M. Kendrick attributes this apparent leniency to &quot;September Morn&quot; status as a work of art, whereas Gerald Carson, writing in &quot;American Heritage&quot;, attributes it to a knowledge that no action could be taken against the work.

The controversy promoted polemics regarding &quot;September Morn&quot; and censorship, and multiple editorial cartoons; one depicted a young woman bathing, only her head showing, with a caption attributed to Comstock reading &quot;Don&#x27;t you suppose I can imagine what is UNDER the water?&quot;. Comstock called the work &quot;demoralizing in the extreme and especially calculated to excite immodesty in the young&quot;, arguing that it must be suppressed in the interest of the children. He emphasized that &quot;the law is the law ... the picture will have to come out of the window&quot;. Reverend Sydney Ussher of St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Episcopal Church took a more moderate approach, explaining that &quot;so vivid a display of nudity as &quot;September Morn&quot;&quot; would best not be displayed in the United States, owing to the people&#x27;s relative lack of appreciation for art.
Others expressed positive views of the painting itself. The suffragist Inez Milholland defended &quot;September Morn&quot;, stating that it was &quot;exquisite and delicate, depicting perfect youth and innocence&quot;, and found it &quot;funny, if it weren&#x27;t so sad&quot; that such a work would be censored while more titillating film posters were left untouched. The social activist Rose Pastor Stokes wrote that this &quot;glorious work of art&quot; was a &quot;rare&quot; depiction of &quot;the loveliest dream that nature ever made real—the human Body Beautiful&quot; and that shame over one&#x27;s body should not be blamed on &quot;September Morn&quot;, but on a failed education system. The artist James Montgomery Flagg proclaimed &quot;only a diseased mind can find anything immoral in &quot;September Morn&quot;&quot;.

In his 1931 autobiography, the public relations pioneer Harry Reichenbach claimed responsibility for the controversy surrounding &quot;September Morn&quot; – and the work&#x27;s resulting popularity. He stated that Braun and Company had acquired some 2,000 reproductions of the painting which they could not sell, and then hired him for $45 so that he could unload the stock. They then paid for a large lithograph reproduction to be made and put on display. Reichenbach, he stated, then contacted public figures to protest against the display. When there was no response, he accosted Comstock in his office and dragged him to the dealership, where some young children, whom Reichenbach had hired for fifty cents each, lusted over the display. The public relations man then worked towards maintaining interest in the work, prints of which had already increased in price – from 10 cents to a dollar. Reichenbach&#x27;s claim that his actions &quot;brought the picture into the newspapers and into fame&quot; has been questioned, particularly given that the Chicago court case had happened months earlier, and contemporary news accounts do not mention him.

====Widespread reproduction and imitation====
A 1937 &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; article stated that, after the 1913 controversies, reproductions of &quot;September Morn&quot; were shown &quot;on the front page of every newspaper in the land&quot;. Ortiz required these newspapers to pay a charge and mention his copyright, otherwise face a penalty of $500 to $1000; Chase recalled that &quot;Vogue&quot; had been one of those charged. These newspaper reproductions, however, were sometimes censored. Fred L. Boalt of &quot;The Seattle Star&quot;, covering a local exhibit of a reproduction, explained his newspaper&#x27;s rationale for such censorship: &quot;For humane as well as other reasons, [...] the &quot;Star&quot; artist has painted in a short petticoat. He didn&#x27;t want to do it. He suffered. But we made him do it.&quot;

Lithograph copies of &quot;September Morn&quot; were mass-produced for popular sale, extending the success that followed the scandal, and were widely hung in private homes. Reproductions were featured on a variety of products, including cigar bands, postcards, bottle openers, statuettes, watch fobs, and candy boxes; the model was also popular as a tattoo. &quot;September Morn&quot; was the first nude used for calendars, and by the late 1950s it had featured on millions. A couplet referring to Chabas&#x27;s work, &quot;Please don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m bad or bold, but where its deep it&#x27;s awful cold&quot;, was widely circulated.
Allusions to the painting were common in vaudeville acts, becoming stock gags in the Orpheum Circuit. Stage imitations of the painting were also created. In 1913, for instance, Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. cast Ann Pennington as the model as part of his &quot;Follies&quot;. In this successful version of &quot;September Morn&quot;, the subject bore a sheer cape, with leaves placed strategically over her body, and stood on a stage made-up as water. A burlesque act, deeming itself the &quot;September Morning Glories&quot;, was also created, as was a three-act musical based on the painting. The latter – featuring a fifty-strong chorus line – was put on by Arthur Gillespie and Frank Tannehill Jr. and debuted at the La Salle Theater in Chicago. In Milwaukee, a man wearing &quot;little or no clothing&quot; passed himself off as &quot;September Morn&quot; at the 1915 Wisconsin State Fair; he was brought to trial and fined $25. Theatrical references to the painting continued into the 1950s. For instance, in Tennessee Williams&#x27;s 1957 play &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot;, the character Val sees it hanging in his room and mentions he &quot;might keep turning the light on to take another look at it&quot;.

&quot;September Morn&quot; also inspired several films. A two-reel production by Pathé, titled &quot;September Morn&quot;, was released in February 1914 and followed the misadventures of a sailor who gets a tattoo of the model. After his girlfriend disapproves, he tries clothing the naked woman with a ripped skirt, but this fails to gain his lover&#x27;s approval; ultimately, he ends up with a fully clothed nude and the text &quot;Votes for Women&quot; inked on his arm. Meanwhile, &quot;September Mourning&quot;, a November 1915 release produced by L-KO, portrayed a pair of artists first vying for the attentions of a young woman in the park, then invading a school for girls. Robert McElravy, reviewing for &quot;Moving Picture World&quot;, found the film funny, but considered it to lack plot. A third film, Lois Weber&#x27;s &quot;Hypocrites&quot;, portrayed &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; (an uncredited Margaret Edwards) in a manner similar to Chabas&#x27;s model. Allusions in popular media continued until at least the 1960s. &quot;September Morn&quot; was alluded to by a 1964 episode of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, &quot;October Eve&quot;, where a nude painting of one of the main characters is discovered for sale in an art gallery.
Several songs inspired by &quot;September Morn&quot; were likewise released. Musicians Frank Black and Bobby Heath penned a song, &quot;September Morn&quot;, based on the painting, and Aubrey Stauffer of Chicago published sheet music (for voice and piano) of &quot;Oh, You September Morn&quot;, from Gillespie and Tannehill&#x27;s musical. At Tin Pan Alley, Henry I. Marshall composed two works, a waltz for piano titled &quot;Matin de Septembre (September Morn)&quot;, and a piece for voice and piano titled &quot;September Morn (I&#x27;d Like to Meet Her)&quot;, the latter featuring lyrics by Stanley Murphy. Both were published through Jerome H. Remick  Co. in 1913.

&quot;September Morn&quot; also inspired an eponymous lime and grenadine cocktail, described in 1917 as having gin, and later in 1930 with rum and egg white. 

As interest grew, purity societies attempted to ban reproductions of &quot;September Morn&quot;, and people in possession of them ran the risk of confiscation and fines. Postcards bearing the painting were banned from the postal system. Harold Marx, a New Orleans art dealer who displayed a reproduction, was arrested a month after being told to take the painting down; displays of reproductions were also forcibly removed in Miami and Atlanta. In Chicago, a man was charged with disorderly conduct after bringing home a reproduction. Irene Deal, who dressed in a union suit and posed as &quot;Miss September Morn&quot; in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, as a publicity stunt, was controversially fined $50 for disorderly conduct. In 1914, students at the College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio, burned a copy of the painting for being against their religious beliefs.

Ultimately some 7 million reproductions of &quot;September Morn&quot;, prints of which remained popular as late as the 1960s, were sold. Reichenbach characterized this popularity as a &quot;laugh on the overzealous guardians of virtue&quot; in which the entire American populace participated. Inspired by the commercial success of &quot;September Morn&quot;, displays of images of nude women became more common; a &quot;New York Times&quot; reader wrote in 1915 that they had become &quot;increasingly vulgar and suggestive&quot;.

In 1937 &quot;Life&quot; deemed &quot;September Morn&quot; &quot;one of the most familiar paintings in the world&quot;, and a retrospective &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; article characterized the model as having become America&#x27;s number one pin-up girl. Writing in 1957, Considine declared &quot;September Morn&quot; to be &quot;the most controversial painting in the history of [the United States]&quot;, and the &quot;New York Post&quot; declared it &quot;the most famous nude till the Marilyn Monroe calendar&quot;. Carson wrote in 1961 that &quot;September Morn&quot; had caused &quot;the most heated controversy over nudity, art, and morals&quot; in the United States since Hiram Powers&#x27; statue &quot;The Greek Slave&quot; in the 1840s.

===Russia and Paris===
The oil baron Leon Mantashev acquired the original &quot;September Morn&quot; in  1913, for a price of $10,000 and brought it with him to Russia. After the outbreak of the October Revolution the painting was feared destroyed. Following Mantashev&#x27;s escape from Russia, pieces of his sizeable collection that were considered to have artistic value were sent to museums, but there was no information regarding works such as &quot;September Morn&quot;. By 1933 Chabas was seeking information regarding his work&#x27;s fate, which &quot;The Milwaukee Journal&quot; suggested was &quot;hanging in some crowded Russian room, its owner perhaps completely ignorant of its world fame&quot;. At the time several American galleries had copies purported to be the original.

The painting, however, was safe; Mantashev had smuggled it out of the country, reportedly &quot;rip[ping] it out of its frame&quot; when the revolution broke out. In the early 1930s, in desperate need of funds, he sold &quot;September Morn&quot; to the Armenian art collector and philanthropist Calouste Gulbenkian for $30,000; it was the last painting he owned. A United Press reporter discovered the painting, which was framed as a tondo, in Gulbenkian&#x27;s Paris home in 1935. There it hung with works by artists such as Claude Monet and Paul Cézanne. By 1937 &quot;September Morn&quot; was on display in the Musée du Luxembourg, hung between works by Jean-François Raffaëlli and Eugène Carrière. The curator John Walker, who between 1947 and 1955 would try to acquire the Gulbenkian Collection for the National Gallery of Art, described it as &#x27;Gulbenkian&#x27;s only lapse in taste.&#x27; After Gulbenkian&#x27;s death in 1955, the painting was acquired by Wildenstein and Company of New York.

===Acquisition by the Metropolitan Museum of Art===
&quot;September Morn&quot; was purchased by the Philadelphia broker and sportsman William Coxe Wright for $22,000 in 1957. In April of that year he offered it to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, but the painting was rejected for having &quot;no relation to the stream of 20th century art&quot;. Eventually he anonymously donated the work – valued at an estimated $30,000 – to the Met in New York City. Speaking for the museum, Dudley T. Easby explained that, although the painting could not be classified as a masterpiece, it was nevertheless &quot;a part of art history in view of the controversy that raged around the picture in earlier years&quot;.
After acquisition, in September 1957 the painting was displayed near the Met&#x27;s front entrance, taking a place previously occupied by the Pérussis Altarpiece. This position of honor was held for several weeks. Hughes reported a &quot;veritable pilgrimage&quot; of visitors came to see the painting, which she considered to add a &quot;fresh, popular appeal&quot; to the Met which drew museum-goers who would never have come otherwise. By then, the earlier scandal of the model&#x27;s nudity had lessened; discussing an exhibit of the painting in Toledo, Ohio, Alan Schoedel of the &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; quoted a viewer as saying that 1950s America was so inundated with racy calendar art that the painting &quot;couldn&#x27;t stand the competition&quot;.

After &quot;September Morn&quot; was acquired by the Met, it was displayed at several venues, including the Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco in 1958, the Toledo Museum of Art in Toledo, Ohio (also 1958), and by the Municipal Art Commission of Los Angeles in 1959. Six years later it was again exhibited at Palace of the Legion of Honor, as part of an exhibition of works collected by the Wrights. In 1971, the Met removed &quot;September Morn&quot; from display and placed it in storage; Walter Monfried of &quot;The Milwaukee Journal&quot; wrote that the once-racy painting was now considered &quot;too tame and banal&quot;. , the Met&#x27;s website lists the painting as not on display, though it had been hung in the museum around 2011.

==Reception==
In 1913, Chabas stated that he was &quot;pained and humiliated&quot; by the controversy over &quot;September Morn&quot;, though he later expressed more positive views. He described the work as &quot;all I know of painting&quot;, and responded positively to statements that it was his masterpiece. In a 1914 interview, he explained that he had not meant to sell the painting, as it &quot;was [his] wife&#x27;s favorite picture&quot;. At the time of his death in 1937, Chabas had only a single picture in his room: a reproduction of the painting, completed from memory; he had boasted &quot;If I had never seen it from the day I put down my brushes after painting it, I could make a perfect copy.&quot; However, not having copyrighted the work, he did not receive any royalties from the marketing frenzy in the United States; he recalled, &quot;Nobody was thoughtful enough even to send me a box of cigars.&quot;

Reviewing the painting after the Salon, Tr.L. in the praised Chabas&#x27;s technique as drawing &quot;of a rare purity&quot;, and modeling &quot;of a remarkable delicacy&quot;. Henri Frantz, reviewing the Paris Salon for &quot;The International Studio&quot;, described &quot;September Morn&quot; as &quot;one of the [Salon]&#x27;s most remarkable figure subjects&quot;, highlighting the nude&#x27;s &quot;graceful form&quot;. In &quot;Le Temps&quot;, François Thiébault-Sisson found that, despite an &quot;excessively translucent technique&quot;, the painting had &quot;indisputable charm&quot; and included &quot;superior, very artistic, and delicately composed&quot; imagery. A 1913 article in the &quot;Oregon Daily Journal&quot; described the model as &quot;beautifully drawn&quot;, and suggested that &quot;it requires a powerful imagination to find anything suggestive in the work&quot;.

Later reviews were less positive. The director of the Met, James Rorimer, wrote in 1957 that &quot;September Morn&quot; stood at &quot;different ends of a wide spectrum&quot; than the works of Old Masters and &quot;modern giants&quot;, but was important in helping viewers &quot;realize the full benefit of our heritage&quot; in their explorations of past and present art. That year, the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; art critic opined that the painting was banal and unacceptable for display in the Met&#x27;s main hall. The reviewer suggested that &quot;September Morn&quot;, with its &quot;delicate, pearly tonality and simple, sparse, airy composition&quot;, would be best served by being displayed among works considered better by early 20th-century collectors but since reviewed poorly, to &quot;dramatiz[e] for the public the danger of too-hasty judgments&quot;.

In 1958, Blake-More Godwin of the Toledo Museum of Art stated that, although &quot;September Morn&quot; was certainly art, it was not &quot;great art&quot; and was overshadowed by the controversy it had created; the painting, he said, &quot;bears the same relationship to art as a minor poem does to the classic and the imperishable&quot;. Three years later, in an article in &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot;, Alfred Werner described &quot;September Morn&quot; as a &quot;classic of kitsch&quot; and &quot;the &#x27;idealized&#x27; nude at its worst&quot;: &quot;without a wrinkle of the skin, without any breathing of the flesh ... pink, soft, spineless&quot;. This classification of kitsch has been applied by several further writers, including Kendrick and the film scholar Norman Taylor.

Several writers have included &quot;September Morn&quot; in lists of works depicting children with erotic or pornographic subtexts. Brauer argues that although the nude &quot;seems to embody the moral purity at puberty&quot;, this innocence is actually a fetishistic mechanism which both allowed the work to pass the censors and be eroticised. She concludes that the painting is &quot;paedophilically provocative&quot;, and that Chabas was protected from censure by his status as an established artist and father. Such views have not been universally held. For instance, the historian Paul S. Boyer describes &quot;September Morn&quot; as &quot;charmingly innocent&quot;, and the art writer Elizabeth Lunday finds the painting to be &quot;offensive only on the grounds of blandness&quot;.

<text>The northern pike (Esox lucius) is a species of carnivorous fish of the genus &quot;Esox&quot; (pikes). They are commonly found in moderately salty and fresh waters of the Northern Hemisphere (&quot;i.e.&quot; holarctic in distribution). They are known simply as a pike (: pike) in Great Britain, Ireland, most of Eastern Europe, Canada and the U.S., although in the Midwest, they may be called a Northern.

Pike can grow to a relatively large size. Their average length is about , with maximum recorded lengths of up to and maximum weights of . The IGFA currently recognises a pike caught by Lothar Louis on Greffern Lake, Germany, on 16 October 1986, as the all-tackle world-record holding northern pike. Northern pike grow to larger sizes in Eurasia than in North America, and in coastal Eurasian regions than inland ones.

==Etymology==
The northern pike gets its common name from its resemblance to the pole-weapon known as the pike (from the Middle English for &#x27;pointed&#x27;). Various other unofficial trivial names are common pike, Lakes pike, great northern pike, great northern, northern (in the U.S. Upper Midwest and in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan), jackfish, jack, slough shark, snake, slimer, slough snake, gator (due to a head similar in shape to that of an alligator), hammer handle, and other such names as &quot;long head&quot; or &quot;pointy nose&quot;. Numerous other names can be found in &quot;Field Museum Zool. Leaflet Number 9&quot;. Its earlier common name, the luci (now lucy) or when fully grown, was used to form its taxonomic name (&quot;Esox lucius&quot;) and is used in heraldry.

==Description==

Northern pike are most often olive green, shading from yellow to white along the belly. The is marked with short, light bar-like spots and a few to many dark spots on the fins. Sometimes, the fins are reddish. Younger pike have yellow stripes along a green body; later, the stripes divide into light spots and the body turns from green to olive green. The lower half of the gill cover lacks scales, and it has large sensory pores on its head and on the underside of its lower jaw which are part of the lateral line system. Unlike the similar-looking and closely related muskellunge, the northern pike has light markings on a dark body background and fewer than six sensory pores on the underside of each side of the lower jaw.

A hybrid between northern pike and muskellunge is known as a tiger muskellunge (&quot;Esox masquinongy × lucius&quot; or &quot;Esox lucius × masquinongy&quot;, depending on the sex of each of the contributing species). In the hybrids, the males are invariably sterile, while females are often fertile, and may back-cross with the parent species. Another form of northern pike, the silver pike, is not a subspecies but rather a mutation that occurs in scattered populations. Silver pike, sometimes called silver muskellunge, lack the rows of spots and appear silver, white, or silvery-blue in color. When ill, silver pike have been known to display a somewhat purplish hue; long illness is also the most common cause of male sterility.

In Italy, the newly identified species &quot;Esox cisalpinus&quot; (&quot;southern pike&quot;) was long thought to be a color variation of the northern pike, but was in 2011 announced to be a species of its own.

===Length and weight===
Northern pike in North America seldom reach the size of their European counterparts; one of the largest specimens known was a specimen from New York. It was caught in Great Sacandaga Lake on 15 September 1940 by Peter Dubuc. Reports of far larger pike have been made, but these are either misidentifications of the pike&#x27;s larger relative, the muskellunge, or simply have not been properly documented and belong in the realm of legend.
As northern pike grow longer, they increase in weight, and the relationship between length and weight is not linear. The relationship between total length (&quot;L&quot;, in inches) and total weight (&quot;W&quot;, in pounds) for nearly all species of fish can be expressed by an equation of the form
:formula_1

Invariably, &quot;b&quot; is close to 3.0 for all species, and &quot;c&quot; is a constant that varies among species. For northern pike, &quot;b&quot; = 3.096 and &quot;c&quot; = 0.000180 (&quot;c&quot; = 7.089 enables one to put length in meters and weight in kilograms). The relationship described in this section suggests a northern pike will weigh about , while a northern pike will weigh about .

===Age===
Northern Pike typically live to 10–15 years, but sometimes up to 25 years.

==Habitat==
Pike are found in sluggish streams and shallow, weedy places in lakes and reservoirs, as well as in cold, clear, rocky waters. They are typical ambush predators; they lie in wait for prey, holding perfectly still for long periods, and then exhibit remarkable acceleration as they strike. They inhabit any water body that contains fish, but suitable places for spawning are also essential. Because of their cannibalistic nature, young pike need places where they can take shelter between plants so they are not eaten. In both cases, rich submerged vegetation is needed. Pike are seldom found in brackish water, except for the Baltic Sea area, here they can be found spending time both in the mouths of rivers and in the open brackish waters of the Baltic Sea. It is normal for pike to return to fresh water after a period in these brackish waters. They seem to prefer water with less turbidity, but that is likely related to their dependence on the presence of vegetation.

===Geographic distribution===

&quot;Esox lucius&quot; is found in fresh water throughout the Northern Hemisphere, including Russia, Europe, and North America. It has also been introduced to lakes in Morocco, and is even found in brackish water of the Baltic Sea, but they are confined to the low-salinity water at the surface of the sea, and are seldom seen in brackish water elsewhere.

Within North America, northern pike populations are found in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, northern Texas, northern New Mexico, northern Arizona, Alaska, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Québec (pike are rare in British Columbia and east coast provinces). Watersheds in which pike are found include the Ohio Valley, the upper Mississippi River and its tributaries, and the Great Lakes Basin. They are also stocked in, or have been introduced to, some western lakes and reservoirs for sport fishing, although some fisheries managers believe this practice often threatens other species of fish such as bass, trout, and salmon, causing government agencies to attempt to exterminate the pike by poisoning lakes, such as Stormy Lake, Alaska. &quot;E. lucius&quot; is a severe invasive predator in Box Canyon Reservoir on the Pend Oreille River in northeastern Washington.

==Behaviour==

===Aggression===
The northern pike is a relatively aggressive species, especially with regard to feeding. For example, when food sources are scarce, cannibalism develops, starting around five weeks in a small percentage of populations. This cannibalism occurs when the ratio of predator to prey is two to one. One can expect this because when food is scarce, Northern pike fight for survival, such as turning on smaller pike to feed; this is seen in other species such as tiger salamanders. Usually, pike tend to feed on smaller fish, such as the banded killifish. However, when pike exceed long, they feed on larger fish.

Because of cannibalism when food is short, pike suffer a fairly high young mortality rate. Cannibalism is more prevalent in cool summers, as the upcoming pike have slow growth rates in that season and might not be able to reach a size to deter the larger pike. Cannibalism is likely to arise in low growth and low food conditions. Pike do not discriminate siblings well, so cannibalism between siblings is likely.

Aggression also arises from a need for space. Young pike tend to have their food stolen by larger pike. Pike are aggressive if not given enough space because they are territorial. They use a form of foraging known as ambush foraging. Unlike species such as perch, pike undergo bursts of energy instead of actively chasing down prey. As such, a fair amount of inactive time occurs until they find prey. Hunting efficiency decreases with competition; the larger the pike, the larger the area controlled by that particular pike. An inverse relation to vegetation density and pike size exists, which is due to the possibility of cannibalism from the largest pike. This makes sense, as the smaller pike need more vegetation to avoid being eaten. Large pike do not have this worry and can afford the advantage of a large line of sight. They prefer a tree structure habitat.

There has been at least one instance of a pike attacking a dog.

Pike are occasionally preyed upon by otters.

===Physical behavioural traits===
Pike are capable of &quot;fast start&quot; movements, which are sudden high-energy bursts of unsteady swimming. Many other fish exhibit this movement as well. Most fish use this mechanism to avoid life-threatening situations. For the pike, however, it is a tool used to capture prey from their sedentary positions. They flash out in such bursts and capture their prey. These fast starts terminate when the pike has reached maximum velocity. During such motions, pike make &quot;S&quot; conformations while swimming at high rates. To decelerate, they, simply make a &quot;C&quot; conformation, exponentially slowing down their speed so that they can &quot;stop&quot;. An interesting behavioural trait that pike have is that they have short digestion times and long feeding periods. They can undergo many of these fast bursts to collect as much prey as they can. Pike are least active during the night.

===Reproduction===
Pike have a strong homing behaviour; they inhabit certain areas by nature. During the summer, they tend to group closer to vegetation than during the winter. The exact reason is not clear, but likely is a result of foraging or possibly reproductive needs to safeguard young. Pike diel rhythm changes significantly over the year. On sunny days, pike stay closer to the shallow shore. On windy days, they are further from shore. When close to the shore, pike have a preference for shallow, vegetated areas. Pike are more stationary in reservoirs than lakes. A possibility is that lakes have more prey to feed upon, or possibly in reservoirs prey will ultimately cross paths with the pike. As such, this could be a form of energy conservation. Pike breed in the spring.

Pike are physically capable of breeding at an age of about two years, spawning in spring when the water temperature first reaches about . They have a tendency to lay a large number of eggs. A likely explanation for such actions is to produce as many surviving offspring as possible, as many most likely die early in life. In females, the gonads enlarge when it is time to shed her eggs. However, after they are shed, these eggs will not hatch if the water is below . Male pike arrive at the breeding grounds before females do, preceding them by a few weeks. In addition, the males stay after the spawning is finished. Parental stock is vital for pike success. Egg survival has been shown to be positively correlated with number of eggs laid. For breeding, the more stable the water, the greater the fitness of the pike. Mortality results from toxic concentrations of iron or rapid temperature changes, and adult abundance and the strength of the resulting year classes are not related. It is based upon two points of development: one during embryo stage between fertilization and closure of the blastopore, and the second between hatching and the termination of the alevin stage.
The colour of the sticky eggs is yellow to orange; the diameter is . The embryos are in length and able to swim after hatching, but stay on the bottom for some time. The embryonic stage is five to 16 days, dependent on water temperature (at and , respectively). Under natural circumstances, the survival from free-swimming larva to 75-mm pike is around 5%.

==Food==
The young, free-swimming pike feed on small invertebrates starting with &quot;Daphnia&quot;, and quickly move on to bigger prey, such as &quot;Asellus&quot; and &quot;Gammarus&quot;. When the body length is , they start feeding on small fish.

A pike has a very typical hunting behaviour; it is able to remain stationary in the water by moving the last fin rays of the dorsal fins and the pectoral fins. Before striking, it bends its body and darts out to the prey using the large surface of its caudal fin, dorsal fin, and anal fin to propel itself. The fish has a distinctive habit of catching its prey sideways in the mouth, immobilising it with its sharp, backward-pointing teeth, and then turning the prey headfirst to swallow it. It eats mainly fish and frogs, but also small mammals and birds fall prey to pike. Young pike have been found dead from choking on a pike of a similar size, an observation referred to by the English poet Ted Hughes in his poem &quot;Pike&quot;. Northern pike also feed on insects, crayfish, and leeches. They are not very particular and eat spiny fish like perch, and will even take fish as small as sticklebacks if they are the only available prey.

Pike are known to occasionally hunt and consume larger water birds, such as an incident in 2016 when an individual was observed trying to drown and eat a great crested grebe, an incident in which a pike choked to death after killing and attempting to eat a tufted duck, as well as an incident in 2015 where an attack by a large pike between three and four feet long was implicated as a possible cause for the injury and death of an adult mute swan on Lower Lough Erne, Northern Ireland, but it is generally believed that such attacks are only rare occurrences.

The northern pike is a largely solitary predator. It migrates during a spawning season, and it follows prey fish like common roaches to their deeper winter quarters. Sometimes, divers observe groups of similar-sized pike that cooperate some to start hunting at the same time, so &quot;wolfpack&quot; theories are given. Large pike can be caught on dead immobile fish, so these pike are thought to move about in a rather large territory to find food. Large pike are also known to cruise large water bodies at a few metres deep, probably pursuing schools of prey fish. Smaller pike are more of ambush predators, probably because of their vulnerability to cannibalism. Pike are often found near the exit of culverts, which can be attributed to the presence of schools of prey fish and the opportunity for ambush. Being potamodromous, all esocids tend to display limited migration, although some local movement may be of key significance for population dynamics. In the Baltic, they are known to follow herring schools, so have some seasonal migration.

==Importance to humans==

Although it is generally known as a &quot;sporting&quot; quarry, some anglers release pike they have caught because the flesh is considered bony, especially due to the substantial (epipleural) &quot;Y-bones&quot;. The white and mild-tasting flesh of pikes nonetheless has a long and distinguished history in cuisine and is popular fare in Europe and parts of North America. Among fishing communities where pike is popular fare, the ability of a filleter to effectively remove the bones from the fillets while minimizing the amount of flesh lost in the process (known as &quot;de-boning&quot;) is a highly valued skill. There are methods for filleting pike and leaving the &quot;y-bones&quot; in the fish&#x27;s body; this does leave some flesh on the fish but avoids the sometimes difficult process of &quot;de-boning&quot;. Larger fish are more easily filleted (and much easier to de-bone), while smaller ones are often processed as forcemeat to eliminate their many small bones, and then used in preparations such as quenelles and fish mousses. Historical references to cooking pike go as far back as the Romans. Fishing for pike is said to be very exciting with their aggressive hits and aerial acrobatics. Pike are among the largest North American freshwater game fish.

Because of their prolific and predatory nature, laws have been enacted in some places to help stop the spread of northern pike outside of their native range. For instance, in California, anglers are required by law to remove the head from a pike once it has been caught. In Alaska, pike are native north and west of the Alaska Range, but have been illegally introduced to south-central Alaska by game fishermen. In south-central Alaska, no limit is imposed in most areas. Pike are seen as a threat to native wild stocks of salmon by some fishery managers.

Notably in Britain and Ireland, pike are greatly admired as a sporting fish and they are returned alive to the water to safeguard future sport and maintain the balance of a fishery. The Pike Anglers Club has campaigned to preserve pike since 1977, arguing that the removal of pike from waters can lead to an explosion of smaller fish, and to ensure pike removal stops, which is damaging to both the sport fishery and the environment.

===Sport fishing===
Pike angling is becoming an increasingly popular pastime in Europe. Effective methods for catching include dead baits, lure fishing, and jerk baiting. They are prized as game fish for their large size and aggressive nature.

Lake fishing for pike from the shore is especially effective during spring, when the big pike move into the shallows to spawn in weedy areas, and later many remain there to feed on other spawning coarse fish species to regain their condition after spawning. Smaller jack pike often remain in the shallows for their own protection, and for the small fish food available there. For the hot summer and during inactive phases, the larger female pike tend to retire to deeper water and/or places with better cover. This gives the boat angler good fishing during the summer and winter seasons. Trolling (towing a fairy or bait behind a moving boat) is a popular technique.

The use of float tubes is another method of fishing for pike on small to medium-sized still waters. Fly fishing for pike is another eligible way of catching these fish, and the float tube is now recognized as an especially suitable water craft for pike fly-fishing. Also they have been caught this way by using patterns that imitate small fry or invertebrates.

In recent decades, more pike are released back to the water after catching (catch and release), but they can easily be damaged when handled. Handling those fish with dry hands can easily damage their mucus-covered skin and possibly lead to their deaths from infections.

Since they have very sharp and numerous teeth, care is required in unhooking a pike. Barbless trebles are recommended when angling for this species, as they simplify unhooking. This is undertaken using long forceps, with 30-cm artery clamps the ideal tool. When holding the pike from below on the lower jaw, it will open its mouth. It should be kept out of the water for the minimum amount of time possible, and should be given extra time to recover if being weighed and photographed before release. It&#x27;s also recommended that anglers use an unhooking mat to prevent it from harm. If practicing live release, calling the fish &quot;caught&quot; when it is alongside a boat is recommended. Remove the hook by grabbing it with needle-nosed pliers while the fish is still submerged and giving it a flip in the direction that turns the hook out of the mouth. This avoids damage to the fish and the stress of being out of water.

In Finland, catching a &quot;kymppihauki&quot;, a pike weighing at least , is considered the qualification as a master fisherman.

Many countries have banned the use of live fish for bait, but pike can be caught with dead fish, which they locate by smell. For this technique, fat marine fish like herring, sardines and mackerel are often used. Compared to other fish like the eel, the pike does not have a good sense of smell, but it is still more than adequate to find the baitfish. Baitfish can be used as groundbait, but also below a float carried by the wind. This method is often used in wintertime and best done in lakes near schools of preyfish or at the deeper parts of shallow water bodies, where pike and preyfish tend to gather in great numbers.

Pike make use of the lateral line system to follow the vortices produced by the perceived prey, and the whirling movement of the spinner is probably a good way to imitate or exaggerate these. Jerkbaits are also effective and can produce spectacular bites with pike attacking these erratic-moving lures at full speed. For trolling, big plugs or softbaits can be used. Spoons with mirror finishes are very effective when the sun is at a sharp angle to the water in the mornings or evenings because they generate the vibrations previously discussed and cause a glint of reflective sunlight that mimics the flash of white-bellied prey.

When fishing in shallow water for smaller pike, lighter and smaller lures are frequently used. The humble &#x27;woolly bugger&#x27; fly is a favourite lure among keen fly fisherman of the southern hemisphere. Fly fishing for pike is an established aspect of the sport and there are now numerous dedicated products to use specifically to target these fish.

===In mythology===
In the Finnish epic poetry &quot;Kalevala&quot;, wise demigod Väinämöinen creates a magical kantele (string instrument) from the jawbone of a giant pike.

<text>A pike is a long thrusting spear formerly used in European warfare from the Late Middle Ages and most of the early modern period, and wielded by foot soldiers deployed in pike square formation, until it was largely replaced by bayonet-equipped muskets. The pike was particularly well known as the primary weapon of Spanish tercios, Swiss mercenary, German Landsknecht units and French sans-culottes. A similar weapon, the sarissa, had been used in antiquity by Alexander the Great&#x27;s Macedonian phalanx infantry.

== Design ==

The pike was a long weapon, varying considerably in size, from long. Generally, a spear becomes a pike when it is too long to be wielded with one hand in combat. It was approximately in weight, with the 16th-century military writer Sir John Smythe recommending lighter rather than heavier pikes. It had a wooden shaft with an iron or steel spearhead affixed. The shaft near the head was often reinforced with metal strips called &quot;cheeks&quot; or . When the troops of opposing armies both carried the pike, it often grew in a sort of arms race, getting longer in both shaft and head length to give one side&#x27;s pikemen an edge in combat. The extreme length of such weapons required a strong wood such as well-seasoned ash for the pole, which was tapered towards the point to prevent the pike from sagging on the ends, although drooping or slight flection of the shaft was always a problem in pike handling. It is a common mistake to refer to a bladed polearm as a pike; such weapons are more generally known as halberds, glaives, ranseurs, bills, or voulges.

The great length of the pikes allowed a great concentration of spearheads to be presented to the enemy, with their wielders at a greater distance, but also made pikes unwieldy in close combat. This meant that pikemen had to be equipped with an additional, shorter weapon such as a dagger or sword in order to defend themselves should the fighting degenerate into a melee. In general, however, pikemen attempted to avoid such disorganized combat, in which they were at a disadvantage. To compound their difficulties in a melee, the pikeman often did not have a shield, or had only a small shield which would be of limited use in close-quarters fighting.

==Tactics==

The pike, being unwieldy, was typically used in a deliberate, defensive manner, often alongside other missile and melee weapons. However, better-trained troops were capable of using the pike in an aggressive attack with each rank of pikemen being trained to hold their pikes so that they presented enemy infantry with four or five layers of spearheads bristling from the front of the formation.

As long as it kept good order, such a formation could roll right over enemy infantry, but it did have weaknesses. The men were all moving forward facing in a single direction and could not turn quickly or efficiently to protect the vulnerable flanks or rear of the formation. Nor could they maintain cohesion over uneven ground, as the Scots discovered to their cost at the Battle of Flodden. The huge block of men carrying such unwieldy spears could be difficult to maneuver in any way other than straightforward movement.

As a result, such mobile pike formations sought to have supporting troops protect their flanks or would maneuver to smash the enemy before they could be outflanked themselves. There was also the risk that the formation would become disordered, leading to a confused melee in which pikemen had the vulnerabilities mentioned above.

According to Sir John Smythe, there were two ways for two opposing pike formations to confront one another: cautious or aggressive. The cautious approach involved fencing at the length of the pike, while the aggressive approach involved quickly closing distance, with each of the first five ranks giving a single powerful thrust. In the aggressive approach, the first rank would then immediately resort to swords and daggers if the thrusts from the first five ranks failed to break the opposing pike formation. Smythe considered the cautious approach laughable.

Although primarily a military weapon, the pike could be surprisingly effective in single combat and a number of 16th-century sources explain how it was to be used in a dueling situation; fencers of the time often practiced with and competed against each other with long staves in place of pikes. George Silver considered the pike one of the more advantageous weapons for single combat in the open, giving it odds over all weapons shorter than or the sword and dagger/shield combination.

==History==

===Ancient Europe===

Although very long spears had been used since the dawn of organized warfare (notably illustrated in art showing Sumerian and Minoan warriors and hunters), the earliest recorded use of a pike-like weapon in the tactical method described above involved the Macedonian sarissa, used by the troops of Alexander the Great&#x27;s father, Philip II of Macedon, and successive dynasties, which dominated warfare for several centuries in many countries. 

After the fall of the last successor of Macedon, the pike largely fell out of use for the next 1,000 or so years. The one exception to this appears to have been in Germany, where Tacitus recorded Germanic tribesmen in the 2nd century AD as using &quot;over-long spears&quot;. He consistently refers to the spears used by the Germans as being &quot;massive&quot; and &quot;very long&quot; suggesting that he is describing in essence a pike. Julius Caesar, in his De Bello Gallico, describes the Helvetii as fighting in a tight, phalanx-like formation with spears jutting out over their shields. Caesar was probably describing an early form of the shieldwall so popular in later times.

===Medieval Europe revival===

In the Middle Ages, the principal users of the pike were urban militia troops such as the Flemings or the peasant array of the lowland Scots. For example, the Scots used a spear formation known as the &quot;schiltron&quot; in several battles during the Wars of Scottish Independence including the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, and the Flemings used their &quot;geldon&quot; long spear to absorb the attack of French knights at the Battle of the Golden Spurs in 1302, before other troops in the Flemish formation counterattacked the stalled knights with goedendags. Both battles were seen by contemporaries as stunning victories of commoners over superbly equipped, mounted, military professionals, where victory was owed to the use of the pike and the brave resistance of the commoners who wielded them.

These formations were essentially immune to the attacks of mounted men-at-arms as long as the knights obligingly threw themselves on the spear wall and the foot soldiers remained steady under the morale challenge of facing a cavalry charge, but the closely packed nature of pike formations rendered them vulnerable to enemy archers and crossbowmen who could shoot them down with impunity, especially when the pikemen did not have adequate armor. Many defeats, such as at Roosebeke and Halidon Hill, were suffered by the militia pike armies when faced by cunning foes who employed their archers and crossbowmen to thin the ranks of the pike blocks before charging in with their (often dismounted) men-at-arms.
Medieval pike formations tended to have better success when they operated in an aggressive fashion. The Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge (1297), for example, utilized the momentum of their charge to overrun an English army while the Englishmen were crossing a narrow bridge. At the Battle of Laupen (1339), Bernese pikemen overwhelmed the infantry forces of the opposing Habsburg/Burgundian army with a massive charge before wheeling over to strike and rout the Austro-Burgundian horsemen as well. At the same time however such aggressive action required considerable tactical cohesiveness or suitable terrain to protect the vulnerable flanks of the pike formations especially from the attack of mounted man-at-arms. When these features were not available, militia often suffered costly failures, such as at the battles of Mons-en-Pevele (1304), Cassel (1328), Roosebeke (1382) and Othee (1408). The constant success of the Swiss mercenaries in the later period was attributed to their extreme discipline and tactical unity due to semi-professional nature, allowing a pike block to somewhat alleviate the threat presented by flanking attacks.

Perhaps copying the nearby Swiss model, the pike had a certain diffusion also in the duchy of Milan in the last two years of the 14th century. In 1391, a decree by Gian Galeazzo Visconti ordered the pikes to be at least 10 feet long in Milan, equivalent to 4.35 m (14.3 ft) and their tips to be reinforced with iron strips to prevent enemies, given their length, from cutting or breaking them. A second decree of 1397 provided that half the infantry of the duchy were armed with pikes.

It was not uncommon for aggressive pike formations to be composed of dismounted men-at-arms, as at the Battle of Sempach (1386), where the dismounted Austrian vanguard, using their lances as pikes, had some initial success against their predominantly halberd-equipped Swiss adversaries. Dismounted Italian men-at-arms also used the same method to defeat the Swiss at the Battle of Arbedo (1422). Equally, well-armored Scottish nobles (accompanied even by King James IV) were recorded as forming the leading ranks of Scottish pike blocks at the Battle of Flodden (1513), incidentally rendering the whole formation resistant to English archery.

===Renaissance Europe heyday===

The Swiss solved the pike&#x27;s earlier problems and brought a renaissance to pike warfare in the 15th century, establishing strong training regimens to ensure they were masters of handling the &quot;Spiess&quot; (the German term for &quot;skewer&quot;) on maneuvers and in combat; they also introduced marching to drums for this purpose. This meant that the pike blocks could rise to the attack, making them less passive and more aggressive formations, but sufficiently well trained that they could go on the defensive when attacked by cavalry. German soldiers known as Landsknechts later adopted Swiss methods of pike handling.

The Scots predominantly used shorter spears in their schiltron formation; their attempt to adopt the longer Continental pike was dropped for general use after its ineffective use led to humiliating defeat at the Battle of Flodden.

Such Swiss and Landsknecht phalanxes also contained men armed with two-handed swords, or &quot;Zweihänder&quot;, and halberdiers for close combat against both infantry and attacking cavalry.

The Swiss were confronted with the German &quot;Landsknecht&quot; who used similar tactics as the Swiss, but more pikes in the more difficult &quot;German thrust&quot; (: holding a pike that had its weight in the lower 1/3 at the end with two hands), which was utilized in a more flexible attacking column.

The high military reputation of the Swiss and the &quot;Landsknechts&quot; again led to the employment of mercenary units across Europe in order to train other armies in their tactics. These two, and others who had adopted their tactics, faced off in several wars, leading to a series of developments as a result.

These formations had great successes on the battlefield, starting with the astonishing victories of the Swiss cantons against Charles the Bold of Burgundy in the Burgundian Wars, in which the Swiss participated in 1476 and 1477. In the Battles of Grandson, Morat, and Nancy, the Swiss not only successfully resisted the attacks of enemy knights, as the relatively passive Scottish and Flemish infantry squares had done in the earlier Middle Ages, but also marched to the attack with great speed and in good formation, their attack columns steamrolling the Burgundian forces, sometimes with great massacre.

The deep pike attack column remained the primary form of effective infantry combat for the next forty years, and the Swabian War saw the first conflict in which both sides had large formations of well-trained pikemen. After that war, its combatants—the Swiss (thereafter generally serving as mercenaries) and their Landsknecht imitators—would often face each other again in the Italian Wars, which would become in many ways the military proving ground of the Renaissance.

The so-called &quot;Schefflin&quot; was a polearm, closely related to the pike, which from the late 1400s and throughout the 16th century saw widespread use in the German-speaking world. It served as a multipurpose weapon for both infantry (in the manner of pikes) and light cavalry (in the manner of demi-lances). Characteristically, it featured a large, hollow-made and leaf-shaped head of about or more, which was attached to a long and slender shaft. Apart from being used by soldiers in battle, a tassel fixed to the socket of the head together with optional further embellishment made the &quot;Schefflin&quot; an appropriate main weapon for princely bodyguards and courtly officials. There seems to be a close relation between the contemporary German term &quot;Schefflin&quot; and the West European terms &quot;javeline&quot; (French) and &quot;javelin&quot; (English), both referring to some type of cavalry spear. Although rarely noticed, many of these weapons have survived to this day. Some pieces, of which many are said to have been used by the personal entourage of Henry VIII, are kept at the Royal Armouries in Leeds.

===Ancient China===
Pikes and long halberds were in use in ancient China from the Warring States period since the 5th century BC. Infantrymen used a variety of long polearm weapons, but the most popular was the dagger-axe, pike-like long spear, and the &quot;ji&quot;. The dagger-axe and &quot;ji&quot; came in various lengths, from ; the weapon consisted of a thrusting spear with a slashing blade appended to it. Dagger-axes and &quot;ji&quot; were an extremely popular weapon in various kingdoms, especially for the Qin state and Qin dynasty, and possibly the succeeding Han dynasty, who produced halberd and pike-like weapons, as well as long pikes during the war against Xiongnu.

===Classical Japan===
During the continuous European development of the pike, Japan experienced a parallel evolution of pole weapons.

In Classical Japan, the Japanese style of warfare was generally fast-moving and aggressive, with far shallower formations than their European equivalents. The naginata and yari were more commonly used than swords for Japanese ashigaru foot soldiers and dismounted samurai due to their greater reach. Naginata, first used around 750 AD, had curved sword-like blades on wooden shafts with often spiked metal counterweights. They were typically used with a slashing action and forced the introduction of shin guards as cavalry battles became more important. Yari were spears of varying lengths; their straight blades usually had sharpened edges or protrusions from the central blade, and were fitted to a hollowed shaft with an extremely long tang.

===Medieval Japan===
During the later half of the 16th century in Medieval Japan, pikes used were generally long, but sometimes up to in length. By this point, pikemen were becoming the main forces in armies. They formed lines, combined with arquebusiers and spearmen. Formations were generally only two or three rows deep.

==Pike and shot==

In the aftermath of the Italian Wars, from the late 15th century to the late 16th century, most European armies adopted the use of the pike, often in conjunction with primitive firearms such as the arquebus and caliver, to form large pike and shot formations.

The quintessential example of this development was the Spanish tercio, which consisted of a large square of pikemen with small, mobile squadrons of arquebusiers moving along its perimeter, as well as traditional men-at-arms. These three elements formed a mutually supportive combination of tactical roles: the arquebusiers harried the enemy line, the pikemen protected the arquebusiers from enemy cavalry charges, and the men-at-arms, typically armed with swords and javelins, fought off enemy pikemen when two opposing squares made contact. The Tercio deployed smaller numbers of pikemen than the huge Swiss and Landsknecht columns, and their formation ultimately proved to be much more flexible on the battlefield.

Mixed formations of men quickly became the norm for European infantrymen, with many, but not all, seeking to imitate the Tercio; in England, a combination of billmen, longbowmen, and men-at-arms remained the norm, though this changed when the supply of yew on the island dwindled.

The percentage of men who were armed with firearms in Tercio-like formations steadily increased as firearms advanced in technology. This advance is believed to be the demise of cavalry when in fact it revived it. From the late 16th century and into the 17th century, smaller pike formations were used, invariably defending attached musketeers, often as a central block with two sub-units of shooters, called &quot;sleeves of shot&quot;, on either side of the pikes. Although the cheaper and versatile infantry increasingly adopted firearms, cavalry&#x27;s proportion in the army remained high.

During the English Civil War (1642–1651) the New Model Army (1646–1660) initially had two musketeers for each pikeman. Two musketeers for each pikeman was not the agreed mix used throughout Europe, and when in 1658, Oliver Cromwell, by then the Lord Protector, sent a contingent of the New Model Army to Flanders to support his French allies under the terms of their treaty of friendship (the Treaty of Paris, 1657) he supplied regiments with equal numbers of musketeers and pikemen.} On the battlefield, the musketeers lacked protection against enemy cavalry, and the two types of foot soldier supported each other.

The post Restoration English Army used pikemen and by 1697 (the last year of the Nine Years&#x27; War) English infantry battalions fighting in the Low Countries still had two musketeers to every pikemen and fought in the now traditional style of pikemen five ranks deep in the centre, with six ranks of musketeers on each side.

According to John Kersey in 1706, the pike was typically in length.

==End of the pike era==

The mid-17th century to the early 18th century saw the decline of the pike in most European armies. This started with the proliferation of the flintlock musket, which gave the musketeer a faster rate of fire than he before possessed, incentivizing a higher ratio of shot to pikes on the battlefield. It continued with development of the plug bayonet, followed by the socket bayonet in the 1680s and 1690s. The plug bayonet did not replace the pike as it required a soldier surrender his ability to shoot or reload to fix it, but the socket bayonet solved that issue. The bayonet added a long blade of up to to the end of the musket, allowing the musket to act as a spear-like weapon when held out with both hands. Although they did not have the full reach of pikes, bayonets were effective against cavalry charges, which used to be the main weakness of musketeer formations, and allowed armies to massively expand their potential firepower by giving every infantryman a firearm; pikemen were no longer needed to protect musketeers from cavalry. Furthermore, improvements in artillery caused most European armies to abandon large formations in favor of multiple staggered lines, both to minimize casualties and to present a larger frontage for volley fire. Thick hedges of bayonets proved to be an effective anti-cavalry solution, and improved musket firepower was now so deadly that combat was often decided by shooting alone.

A common end date for the use of the pike in most infantry formations is 1700, such as the Prussian and Austrian armies. Others, including the Swedish and Russian armies, continued to use the pike as an effective weapon for several more decades, until the 1720s and 1730s (the Swedes of King Charles XII in particular using it to great effect until 1721). At the start of the Great Northern War in 1700, Russian line infantry companies had 5 NCOs, 84 musketeers, and 18 pikemen, the musketeers initially being equipped with sword-like plug bayonets; they did not fully switch to socket bayonets until 1709. A Swedish company consisted of 82 musketeers, 48 pikemen, and 16 grenadiers. The Army of the Holy Roman Empire maintained a ratio of 2 muskets to 1 pike in the middle to late 17th century, officially abandoning the pike in 1699. The French, meanwhile, had a ratio of 3-4 muskets to 1 pike by 1689. Both sides of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in the 1640s and 1650s preferred a ratio of 2 muskets to 1 pike, but this was not always possible.

During the American Revolution (1775–1783), pikes called &quot;trench spears&quot; made by local blacksmiths saw limited use until enough bayonets could be procured for general use by both Continental Army and attached militia units.

Throughout the Napoleonic era, the spontoon, a type of shortened pike that typically had a pair of blades or lugs mounted to the head, was retained as a symbol by some NCOs; in practice it was probably more useful for gesturing and signaling than as a weapon for combat.

As late as Poland&#x27;s Kościuszko Uprising in 1794, the pike reappeared as a child of necessity which became, for a short period, a surprisingly effective weapon on the battlefield. In this case, General Thaddeus Kosciuszko, facing a shortage of firearms and bayonets to arm landless serf partisans recruited straight from the wheat fields, had their sickles and scythes heated and straightened out into something resembling crude &quot;war scythes&quot;. These weaponized agricultural accouterments were then used in battle as both cutting weapons, as well as makeshift pikes. The peasant &quot;pikemen&quot; armed with these crude instruments played a pivotal role in securing a near impossible victory against a far larger and better equipped Russian army at the Battle of Racławice, which took place on 4 April 1794.

Civilian pikeman played a similar role, though outnumbered and outgunned, in the 1798 rising in Ireland four years later. Here, especially in the Wexford Rebellion and in Dublin, the pike was useful mainly as a weapon by men and women fighting on foot against cavalry armed with guns.

Improvised pikes, made from bayonets on poles, were used by escaped convicts during the Castle Hill rebellion of 1804.

As late as the Napoleonic Wars, at the beginning of the 19th century, even the Russian militia (mostly landless peasants, like the Polish partisans before them) could be found carrying shortened pikes into battle. As the 19th century progressed, the obsolete pike would still find a use in such countries as Ireland, Russia, China, and Australia, generally in the hands of desperate peasant rebels who did not have access to firearms. John Brown purchased a large number of pikes and brought them to his raid on Harpers Ferry.

One attempt to resurrect the pike as a primary infantry weapon occurred during the American Civil War (1861–1865) when the Confederate States of America planned to recruit twenty regiments of pikemen in 1862. In April 1862 it was authorised that every Confederate infantry regiment would include two companies of pikemen, a plan supported by Robert E. Lee. Many pikes were produced but were never used in battle and the plan to include pikemen in the army was abandoned.
Shorter versions of pikes called &quot;boarding pikes&quot; were also used on warships—typically to repel boarding parties, up to the late 19th century.

The great Hawaiian warrior king Kamehameha I had an elite force of men armed with very long spears who seem to have fought in a manner identical to European pikemen, despite the usual conception of his people&#x27;s general disposition for individualistic dueling as their method of close combat. It is not known whether Kamehameha himself introduced this tactic or if it was taken from the use of traditional Hawaiian weapons.

The pike was issued as a British Home Guard weapon in 1942 after the War Office acted on a letter from Winston Churchill saying &quot;every man must have a weapon of some kind, be it only a mace or pike&quot;. However, these hand-held weapons never left the stores after the pikes had &quot;generated an almost universal feeling of anger and disgust from the ranks of the Home Guard, demoralised the men and led to questions being asked in both Houses of Parliament&quot;. The pikes, made from obsolete Lee–Enfield rifle bayonet blades welded to a steel tube, took the name of &quot;Croft&#x27;s Pikes&quot; after Henry Page Croft, the Under-Secretary of State for War who attempted to defend the fiasco by stating that they were a &quot;silent and effective weapon&quot;.

In Spain, beginning in 1715 and ending in 1977, there were night patrol guards in cities called &quot;serenos&quot; who carried a short pike of called &quot;chuzo&quot;.

Pikes live on today only in ceremonial roles, being used to carry the colours of an infantry regiment and with the Company of Pikemen and Musketeers of the Honourable Artillery Company, or by some of the infantry units on duty during their rotation as guard for the President of the Italian Republic at the Quirinal Palace in Rome, Italy.

<text>Pike is an interpreted, general-purpose, high-level, cross-platform, dynamic programming language, with a syntax similar to that of C. Unlike many other dynamic languages, Pike is both statically and dynamically typed, and requires explicit type definitions. It features a flexible type system that allows the rapid development and flexible code of dynamically typed languages, while still providing some of the benefits of a statically-typed language.

Pike features garbage collection, advanced data types, and first-class anonymous functions, with support for many programming paradigms, including object-oriented, functional and imperative programming. Pike is free software, released under the GPL, LGPL and MPL licenses.

== History ==
Pike has its roots in LPC, which was a language developed for MUDs. Programmers at Lysator in Linköping, Sweden, most notably Fredrik Hübinette and Per Hedbor, separated the language and virtual machine from the rest of the MUD driver, and used it as a rapid prototyping language for various applications, calling it LPC4.

LPC&#x27;s license did not allow use for commercial purposes, and so a new GPL implementation was written in 1994, called μLPC (micro LPC).

In 1996, μLPC was renamed to Pike in order to provide a more commercially viable name. Although the name of the company has changed over the years, the company now known as Roxen Internet Software employed many Pike developers, and provided resources for Pike&#x27;s development. Roxen is also the name of a web server developed by the company in Pike. In 2002, the programming environment laboratory at Linköping University took over maintenance of Pike from Roxen. Several Pike programmers have found their way to the Linköping office of Opera Software, where the language plays a central role in the server/gateway parts of the Opera Mini application.

==Example==

int main()
 write(&quot;Hi there! What&#x27;s your name?\n&quot;);
 string name = Stdio.stdin-&gt;gets();
 write(&quot;Nice to meet you, &quot; + name + &quot;!\n&quot;);
 return 0;

<text>The iris (: irides or irises) is a thin, annular structure in the eye in most mammals and birds that is responsible for controlling the diameter and size of the pupil, and thus the amount of light reaching the retina. In optical terms, the pupil is the eye&#x27;s aperture, while the iris is the diaphragm. Eye color is defined by the iris.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;iris&quot; is derived from the Greek word for &quot;rainbow&quot;, also its goddess plus messenger of the gods in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, because of the many colours of this eye part.

==Structure==
The iris consists of two layers: the front pigmented layer known as a stroma and, behind the stroma, pigmented epithelial cells.

The stroma is connected to a sphincter muscle (sphincter pupillae), which contracts the pupil in a circular motion, and a set of dilator muscles (dilator pupillae), which pull the iris radially to enlarge the pupil, pulling it in folds.

The sphincter pupillae is the opposing muscle of the dilator pupillae. The pupil&#x27;s diameter, and thus the inner border of the iris, changes size when constricting or dilating. The outer border of the iris does not change size. The constricting muscle is located on the inner border.

The back surface is covered by a heavily pigmented epithelial layer that is two cells thick (the iris pigment epithelium), but the front surface has no epithelium. This anterior surface projects as the dilator muscles. The high pigment content blocks light from passing through the iris to the retina, restricting it to the pupil. The outer edge of the iris, known as the root, is attached to the sclera and the anterior ciliary body. The iris and ciliary body together are known as the anterior uvea. Just in front of the root of the iris is the region referred to as the trabecular meshwork, through which the aqueous humour constantly drains out of the eye, with the result that diseases of the iris often have important effects on intraocular pressure and indirectly on vision. The iris along with the anterior ciliary body provide a secondary pathway for aqueous humour to drain from the eye.

The iris is divided into two major regions:
# The pupillary zone is the inner region whose edge forms the boundary of the pupil.
# The ciliary zone is the rest of the iris that extends to its origin at the ciliary body.
The collarette is the thickest region of the iris, separating the pupillary portion from the ciliary portion. The collarette is a vestige of the coating of the embryonic pupil. It is typically defined as the region where the sphincter muscle and dilator muscle overlap. Radial ridges extend from the periphery to the pupillary zone, to supply the iris with blood vessels. The root of the iris is the thinnest and most peripheral.

The muscle cells of the iris are smooth muscle in mammals and amphibians, but are striated muscle in reptiles (including birds). Many fish have neither, and, as a result, their irises are unable to dilate and contract, so that the pupil always remains of a fixed size.

===Front===
*The crypts of Fuchs are a series of openings located on either side of the collarette that allow the stroma and deeper iris tissues to be bathed in aqueous humor. Collagen trabeculae that surround the border of the crypts can be seen in blue irises.
*The midway between the collarette and the origin of the iris: These folds result from changes in the surface of the iris as it dilates.
*Crypts on the base of the iris are additional openings that can be observed close to the outermost part of the ciliary portion of the iris.

===Back===
*The radial contraction folds of Schwalbe are a series of very fine radial folds in the pupillary portion of the iris extending from the pupillary margin to the collarette. They are associated with the scalloped appearance of the pupillary ruff.
*The structural folds of Schwalbe are radial folds extending from the border of the ciliary and pupillary zones that are much broader and more widely spaced, continuous with the &quot;valleys&quot; between the ciliary processes.
*Some of the circular contraction folds are a fine series of ridges that run near the pupillary margin and vary in thickness of the iris pigment epithelium; others are in ciliary portion of iris.

===Microanatomy===


From anterior (front) to posterior (back), the layers of the iris are:
*Anterior limiting layer
*Stroma of iris
*Iris sphincter muscle
*Iris dilator muscle (myoepithelium)
*Anterior pigment epithelium
*Posterior pigment epithelium

===Development===
The stroma and the anterior border layer of the iris are derived from the neural crest, and behind the stroma of the iris, the sphincter pupillae and dilator pupillae muscles, as well as the iris epithelium, develop from optic cup neuroectoderm.

== Function ==

The iris controls the size of the pupil by means of contracting the iris sphincter muscle and/or the iris dilator muscle. The size of the pupils is dependent on many factors (including light, emotional state, cognitive load, arousal, stimulation), and can range from less than 2 mm in diameter, to as large as 9 mm in diameter. However, there is considerable variation in maximal pupil diameter by individual humans, and decreases with age. The irises also contract the pupils when accommodation is initiated, to increase the depth of field.

Very few humans possess the ability to exert direct voluntary control over their iris muscles, which grants them the ability to dilate and constrict their pupils on command. However, there is no clear purpose or advantage to this.

==Eye color==


The iris is usually strongly pigmented, with the color typically ranging between brown, hazel, green, gray, and blue. Occasionally, the color of the iris is due to a lack of pigmentation, as in the pinkish-white of oculocutaneous albinism, or to obscuration of its pigment by blood vessels, as in the red of an abnormally vascularised iris. Despite the wide range of colors, the only pigment that contributes substantially to normal iris color is the dark pigment melanin. The quantity of melanin pigment in the iris is one factor in determining the phenotypic eye color of an organism. Structurally, this huge molecule is only slightly different from its equivalent found in skin and hair. Iris color is due to variable amounts of eumelanin (brown/black melanins) and pheomelanin (red/yellow melanins) produced by melanocytes. More of the former is found in brown-eyed people and of the latter in blue- and green-eyed people. The limbal ring appears as a dark ring encircling the iris on some individuals, but is a result of the optical properties of the region between the cornea and sclera, not of pigments in the iris.

===Genetic and physical factors determining iris color===

Iris color is a highly complex phenomenon consisting of the combined effects of texture, pigmentation, fibrous tissue, and blood vessels within the iris stroma, which together make up an individual&#x27;s epigenetic constitution in this context. An organism&#x27;s &quot;eye color&quot; is actually the color of one&#x27;s iris, the cornea being transparent and the white sclera entirely outside the area of interest.

Melanin is yellowish to dark hazel in the stromal pigment cells, and black in the iris pigment epithelium, which lies in a thin but very opaque layer across the back of the iris. Most human irises also show a condensation of the brownish stromal melanin in the thin anterior border layer, which by its position has an overt influence on the overall color. The degree of dispersion of the melanin, which is in subcellular bundles called melanosomes, has some influence on the observed color, but melanosomes in the iris of humans and other vertebrates are not mobile, and the degree of pigment dispersion cannot be reversed. Abnormal clumping of melanosomes does occur in disease and may lead to irreversible changes in iris color (see heterochromia, below). Colors other than brown or black are due to selective reflection and absorption from the other stromal components. Sometimes, lipofuscin, a yellow &quot;wear and tear&quot; pigment, also enters into the visible eye color, especially in aged or diseased green eyes.

The optical mechanisms by which the nonpigmented stromal components influence eye color are complex, and many erroneous statements exist in the literature. Simple selective absorption and reflection by biological molecules (hemoglobin in the blood vessels, collagen in the vessel and stroma) is the most important element. Rayleigh scattering and Tyndall scattering, (which also happen in the sky) and diffraction also occur. Raman scattering, and constructive interference, as in the feathers of birds, do not contribute to the color of the eye, but interference phenomena are important in the brilliantly colored iris pigment cells (iridophores) in many animals. Interference effects can occur at both molecular and light-microscopic scales, and are often associated (in melanin-bearing cells) with quasicrystalline formations, which enhance the optical effects. Interference is recognised by characteristic dependence of color on the angle of view, as seen in eyespots of some butterfly wings, although the chemical components remain the same.
White babies are usually born blue-eyed since no pigment is in the stroma, and their eyes appear blue due to scattering and selective absorption from the posterior epithelium. If melanin is deposited substantially, brown or black color is seen; if not, they will remain blue or gray.

All the contributing factors towards eye color and its variation are not fully understood. Autosomal recessive/dominant traits in iris color are inherent in other species, but coloration can follow a different pattern.

===Different colors in the two eyes===
Heterochromia (also known as a heterochromia iridis or heterochromia iridum) is an ocular condition in which one iris is a different color from the other iris (complete heterochromia), or where the part of one iris is a different color from the remainder (partial heterochromia or sectoral heterochromia). Uncommon in humans, it is often an indicator of ocular disease, such as chronic iritis or diffuse iris melanoma, but may also occur as a normal variant. Sectors or patches of strikingly different colors in the same iris are less common. Anastasius the First was dubbed &quot;dikoros&quot; (having two irises) for his patent heterochromia since his right iris had a darker color than the left one.

In contrast, heterochromia and variegated iris patterns are common in veterinary practice. Siberian Husky dogs show heterochromia, possibly analogous to the genetically determined Waardenburg syndrome of humans. Some white cat fancies (e.g., white Turkish Angora or white Turkish Van cats) may show striking heterochromia, with the most common pattern being one uniformly blue, the other copper, orange, yellow, or green. Striking variation within the same iris is also common in some animals, and is the norm in some species. Several herding breeds, particularly those with a blue merle coat color (such as Australian Shepherds and Border Collies) may show well-defined blue areas within a brown iris, as well as separate blue and darker eyes. Some horses (usually within the white, spotted, palomino, or cremello groups of breeds) may show amber, brown, white and blue all within the same eye, without any sign of eye disease.

One eye with a white or bluish-white iris is also known as a &quot;walleye&quot;.

*Aniridia
*Anisocoria
*Horner&#x27;s syndrome
*Iridocyclitis
*Iridoplegia
*Iritis
*Miosis/Mydriasis
*Synechia
*Third nerve palsy

==Alternative medicine==
===Iridology===

Iridology (also known as iridodiagnosis) is an alternative medicine technique whose proponents believe that patterns, colors, and other characteristics of the iris can be examined to determine information about a patient&#x27;s systemic health. Practitioners match their observations to &quot;iris charts&quot;, which divide the iris into zones corresponding to specific parts of the human body. Iridologists see the eyes as &quot;windows&quot; into the body&#x27;s state of health.

Iridology is not supported by quality research studies, and is considered pseudoscience.

<text>Bukhara ( ) is the seventh-largest city in Uzbekistan by population, with 280,187 residents . It is the capital of Bukhara Region. 

People have inhabited the region around Bukhara for at least five millennia, and the city has existed for half that time. Located on the Silk Road, the city has long served as a center of trade, scholarship, culture, and religion. Bukhara served as the capital of the Khanate of Bukhara, and Emirate of Bukhara. It was the birthplace of the scholar Imam Bukhari. The city has been known as &quot;Noble Bukhara&quot; (&quot;Bukhārā-ye sharīf&quot;). Bukhara has about 140 architectural monuments. UNESCO has listed the historic center of Bukhara (which contains numerous mosques and madrasas) as a World Heritage Site.

==Names==
The exact name of the city of Bukhara in ancient times is unknown. The whole oasis was called Bukhara in ancient times, and probably only in the tenth century was it finally transferred to the city.

According to some scholars, the name dates back to the Sanskrit &quot;vihāra&quot; (Buddhist monastery). This word is very close to the word in the language of the Uyghur and Chinese Buddhists, who named their places of worship the same way. Very few artifacts related to Buddhism have survived into the modern day in the city. But, numerous Arabic, Persian, European and Chinese travellers and historians noted the place and Transoxiana itself to be once populated by mostly Buddhists and few Zoroastrians. Indeed, the first Islamic text on Bukhara relates to the first Arab invader of Bukhara, Ubaidullah bin Ziad, who noted Bukhara to be a Buddhist country with Buddhist monasteries ruled by a queen regent acting on behalf of her son.

According to other sources (such as &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;), the name Bukhara is possibly derived from the Sogdian &quot;βuxārak&quot; (&#x27;Place of Good Fortune&#x27;), a name for Buddhist monasteries.

In the Tang dynasty, and other successive dynasties of Imperial China, Bukhara was known under the name of &quot;Bǔhē&quot; (捕喝), which has been replaced in Chinese by the modern generic phonetic spelling &quot;Bùhālā&quot; (布哈拉).

Between the 19th and 20th centuries, Bukhara was known as &quot;Bokhara&quot; in the English publications as exemplified by the writings and reports on the Emirate of Bukhara during the Great Game.

Muhammad ibn Jafar Narshakhi in his &quot;History of Bukhara&quot; (completed AD 943–44) mentions: 
Since the Middle Ages, the city has been known as &quot;Bukhārā&quot; / بخارا in Arabic and Persian sources. The modern Uzbek spelling is &quot;Buxoro&quot;.

The city&#x27;s name was mythologized as &quot;Albracca&quot; in the Italian epic poem &quot;Orlando Innamorato,&quot; published in 1483 by Matteo Maria Boiardo.

==History==

The history of Bukhara stretches back millennia. Along with Samarkand, Bukhara was the epicentre of the Persian culture in medieval Asia until the fall of Timurid dynasty.
By 850, Bukhara served as the capital of the Samanid Empire, and was the birthplace of Imam Bukhari. The Samanids, claiming descent from Bahram Chobin, rejuvenated Persian culture far from Baghdad, the centre of the Islamic world. New Persian flourished in Bukhara and Rudaki, the father of Persian poetry, was born and raised in Bukhara and wrote his most famous poem about the beauty of the city. For this purpose, Bukhara had continuously served as the most important of cities in many Persian and Persianate empires, namely Samanids, Karakhanids, Khwarazmids, and Timurids.

The influence of Bukhara in the wider Islamic world started to diminish starting from the arrival of another Turkic dynasty of Uzbeks in the 16th Century. Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar was the last Persian emperor who attempted to retake the city just before his assassination, and by the 19th century the city had become a peripheral city in the Persian and the Islamic world, being ruled by local Emirs of Bukhara, who were the last Persianate princes before the fall of the city to the red army.

At the beginning of the 11th century, Bukhara became part of the Turkic state of the Karakhanids. The rulers of the Karakhanids built many buildings in Bukhara: the Kalyan minaret, the Magoki Attori mosque, palaces and parks.

Bukhara lies west of Samarkand and was previously a focal point of learning eminent all through the Persian and the Islamic world. It is the old neighborhood of the incomparable Sheik Naqshbandi. He was a focal figure in the advancement of the mysterious Sufi way to deal with theory, religion and Islam.
It is now the capital of Bukhara Region (viloyat) of Uzbekistan. Located on the Silk Road, the city has long been a center of trade, scholarship, culture, and religion. During the golden age of the Samanids, Bukhara became a major intellectual center of the Islamic world, and was renowned for its numerous libraries. The historic center of Bukhara, which contains numerous mosques and madrassas, has been listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.

Genghis Khan besieged Bukhara for 15 days in 1220. As an important trading centre, Bukhara was home to a community of medieval Indian merchants from the city of Multan (modern-day Pakistan) who were noted to own land in the city.
For several centuries, the cities of Bukhara av Khiva were known as major centers of the slave trade, and the Bukhara slave trade, alongside the neighboring slave trade in Khiva, has been referred to as the &quot;slave capitals of the world&quot;. 
Bukhara was the last capital of the Emirate of Bukhara and was besieged by the Red Army during the Russian Civil War. During the Bukhara operation of 1920, Red Army troops under the command of Bolshevik general Mikhail Frunze attacked the city of Bukhara. On 31 August 1920, the Emir Alim Khan fled to Dushanbe in Eastern Bukhara (later he escaped from Dushanbe to Kabul in Afghanistan). On 2 September 1920, after four days of fighting, the emir&#x27;s citadel (the &quot;Ark&quot;) was destroyed and the red flag was raised from the top of Kalyan Minaret. On 14 September 1920, the All-Bukharan Revolutionary Committee was set up, headed by A. Mukhitdinov. The government—the Council of People&#x27;s Nazirs (see &quot;nāẓir&quot;)—was presided over by Fayzulla Xoʻjayev.

The Bukharan People&#x27;s Soviet Republic existed from 1920 to 1924 when the city was integrated into the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. Fitzroy Maclean, then a young diplomat in the British Embassy in Moscow, made a surreptitious visit to Bokhara in 1938, sight-seeing and sleeping in parks. In his memoir &quot;Eastern Approaches&quot;, he judged it an &quot;enchanted city&quot; with buildings that rivalled &quot;the finest architecture of the Italian Renaissance&quot;. In the latter half of the 20th century, the war in Afghanistan and civil war in Tajikistan brought Dari- and Tajik-speaking refugees into Bukhara and Samarkand. After integrating themselves into the local Tajik population, these cities face a movement for annexation into Tajikistan with which the cities have no common border.

==Landmarks==
===Architectural complexes===
* Po-i-Kalyan Complex. The title Po-i Kalan or Poi Kalân ( &#x27;Grand Foundation&#x27;) belongs to the architectural complex located at the base of the great minaret Kalân.
*Kalyan minaret. More properly, Minâra-i Kalân (Persian/Tajik for &#x27;Grand Minaret&#x27;). Also known as the Tower of Death, as according to legend it is the site where criminals were executed by being thrown off the top for centuries. The minaret is the most famed part of the ensemble, and dominates over historical center of the city. The role of the minaret is largely for traditional and decorative purposes—its dimension exceeds the bounds of the main function of the minaret, which is to provide a vantage point from which the muezzin can call out people to prayer. For this purpose it was enough to ascend to a roof of a mosque. This practice was common in initial years of Islam. The word &quot;minaret&quot; derives from the Arabic word منارة &quot;manāra&quot; (&#x27;lighthouse&#x27;, or more literally &#x27;a place where something burns&#x27;). The minarets of the region were possible adaptations of &quot;fire-towers&quot; or lighthouses of previous Zoroastrian eras. The architect, whose name was simply Bako, designed the minaret in the form of a circular-pillar brick tower, narrowing upwards. The diameter of the base is , while at the top it is . The tower is high, and can be seen from vast distances over the flat plains of Central Asia. There is a brick spiral staircase that twists up inside around the pillar, leading to the landing in sixteen-arched rotunda and skylight, upon which is based a magnificently designed stalactite cornice (or &quot;sharif&quot;).
*Kalân Mosque (Masjid-i Kalân), arguably completed in 1514, is equal to the Bibi-Khanym Mosque in Samarkand in size. The mosque is able to accommodate twelve thousand people. Although Kalyan Mosque and Bibi-Khanym Mosque of Samarkand are of the same type of building, they are different in terms of art of building. Two hundred and eighty-eight monumental pylons serve as a support for the multi-domed roofing of the galleries encircling the courtyard of Kalyan Mosque. The longitudinal axis of the courtyard ends up with a portal to the main chamber (maksura) with a cruciform hall, topped with a massive blue cupola on a mosaic drum. The edifice keeps many architectural curiosities, for example, a hole in one of domes. Through this hole one can see foundation of Kalyan Minaret. Then moving back step by step, one can count all belts of brickwork of the minaret to the rotunda.
*Mir-i Arab Madrassah (1535–1536). The construction of Mir-i-Arab Madrasah (Miri Arab Madrasah) is ascribed to Sheikh Abdullah Yamani of Yemen—called Mir-i-Arab—the spiritual mentor of Ubaidullah Khan and his son Abdul-Aziz Khan. Ubaidullah-khan waged permanent successful war with Iran. At least three times his troops seized Herat. Each of such plundering raids on Iran was accompanied by capture of great many captives. They say that Ubaidullah-khan had invested money gained from redemption of more than three thousand Persian captives into construction of Mir-i-Arab Madrasah. Ubaidullah-khan was very religious. He had been nurtured in high respect for Islam in the spirit of Sufism. His father named him in honor of prominent sheikh of the 15th century Ubaidullah al-Ahrar (1404–1490), by origin from Tashkent Region. By the 1530s, when sovereigns erected splendid mausoleums for themselves and for their relatives, was over. Khans of Shaibanid dynasty were standard-bearers of Koran traditions. The significance of religion was so great that even such famed khan as Ubaidullah was conveyed to earth close by his mentor in his madrasah. In the middle of the vault (gurhana) in Mir-i-Arab Madrasah is situated the wooden tomb of Ubaidullah-khan. At his head is wrapped in the moulds his mentor, Mir-i-Arab. Muhammad Kasim, mudarris (a senior teacher) of the madrasah (died in 1047 hijra) is also interred near by here. The portal of Miri Arab Madrasah is situated on one axis with the portal of the Kalyan Mosque. However, because of some lowering of the square to the east it was necessary to raise a little an edifice of the madrasah on a platform.
*Lab-i Hauz Complex (or &quot;Lab-e hauz&quot;, , meaning &quot;by the pond&quot;) Ensemble (1568–1622) is the name of the area surrounding one of the few remaining &quot;hauz&quot;, or pond, in the city of Bukhara. Several such ponds existed in Bukhara prior to Soviet rule. The ponds acted as the city&#x27;s principal source of water, but were also notorious for spreading disease, and thus were mostly filled in during the 1920s and 1930s by the Soviets. The Lab-i Hauz survived owing to its role as the centerpiece of an architectural ensemble dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries. The Lab-i Hauz ensemble consists of the 16th-century Kukeldash Madrasah, the largest in the city, along the north side of the pond. On the eastern and western sides of the pond are a 17th-century lodging-house for itinerant Sufis, and a 17th-century madrasah.
:There is also a metal sculpture of Nasruddin Hodja, the quick-witted and warm-hearted man, who forms the central character of many children&#x27;s folk stories in Central Asian, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, sitting atop his mule with one hand on his heart and the other with an &#x27;All OK&#x27; sign above his head.

*Bahoutdin Architectural Complex is a necropolis commemorating Shaykh Baha-ud-Din or Bohoutdin, the founder of Naqshbandi order. The complex includes the &quot;dahma&quot; (gravestone) of Bahoutdin, Khakim Kushbegi mosque, Muzaffarkan mosque, and Abdul-Lazizkhan khanqah. The site is listed on the UNESCO World Heritage Site tentative list on 18 January 2008.

===Fortress===

*Bukhara Fortress, the Ark
===Mausoleums===
* Boboyi Poradoz Mausoleum
The Boboyi Poradoz Mausoleum (Uzbek: Boboyi Poradoʻz maqbarasi) is a monument of architecture in Bukhara Region. The mausoleum was built in the 19th century and is located behind the Salakhona gate. Today the mausoleum is located opposite the Ibn Sina Library of Bukhara. The mausoleum is included in the National List of Objects of Material Cultural Heritage of Uzbekistan of Republican Importance.

*Chashma-Ayub Mausoleum
Chashma-Ayub, or &quot;Job&#x27;s spring,&quot; is located near the Samani mausoleum. Its name is said to reflect a legend that states the prophet Job (&quot;Ayub&quot; in the Quran) visited this place and brought forth a spring of water by the blow of his staff on the ground. The water of this well is said to be exceptionally pure, and is regarded for its supposed &quot;healing qualities.&quot; The current edifice at the site was constructed during the reign of Timur, and features a Khwarazm-style conical dome that is otherwise uncommon in the region.

*Ismail Samani mausoleum
The Ismail Samani mausoleum (between 9th and 10th centuries), is one of the most highly esteemed work of Central Asian architecture. It was built in the 9th century (between 892 and 943) as the resting-place of Ismail Samani—the founder of the Samanid dynasty, which was the last native Persian dynasty to rule the region in the 9th to 10th centuries, after the Samanids established virtual independence from the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad.

The site is unique for its architectural style which combines both Zoroastrian and Islamic motifs. The building&#x27;s facade is covered in intricately decorated brick work, which features circular patterns reminiscent of the sun—a common image in Zoroastrian art from the region at that time which is reminiscent of the Zoroastrian god, Ahura Mazda, who is typically represented by fire and light. The building&#x27;s shape is cuboid, and reminiscent of the Ka&#x27;aba in Makkah, while the domed roof is a typical feature of mosque architecture. The syncretic style of the shrine is reflective of the 9th and 10th centuries—a time when the region still had large populations of Zoroastrians who had begun to convert to Islam around that time.

The shrine is also regarded as one of the oldest monuments in the Bukhara region. At the time of Genghis Khan&#x27;s invasion, the shrine was said to have already been buried in mud from flooding. Thus, when the Mongol hordes reached Bukhara, the shrine was spared from their destruction.

The mausoleum of Pakistan&#x27;s founding father, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, known as the Mazar-e-Quaid in Karachi, was modeled after the shrine.

===Mosques===
*Bolo Haouz Mosque

Built in 1712, on the opposite side of the citadel of Ark in Registan district, Bolo Haouz Mosque is inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list along with the other parts of the historic city. It served as a Friday mosque during the time when the emir of Bukhara was being subjugated under the Bolshevik Russian rule in the 1920s.

*Char Minar

Char Minor (alternatively spelled Chor Minor, and also alternatively known as the Madrasah of Khalif Niyaz-kul) is a building tucked away in a lane northeast of the Lyabi Hauz complex. The structure was built by Khalif Niyaz-kul, a wealthy Bukharan of Turkmen origin in the 19th century under the rule of the Janid dynasty. The four-towered structure is sometimes mistaken for a gate to the madras that once existed behind the structure; however, the Char-Minar is actually a complex of buildings with two functions, ritual and shelter.

The main edifice is a mosque. In spite of its unusual outward shape, the building has a typical interior for a Central Asian mosque. Owing to the buildings cupola, the room has good acoustic properties and therefore takes on special significance of &#x27;dhikr-hana&#x27;—a place for ritualized &#x27;dhikr&#x27; ceremonies of Sufi, the liturgy of which often include recitation, singing, and instrumental music.

On either side of the central edifice are located dwelling rooms, some of which have collapsed, leaving only their foundations visible. Consequently, for full functioning of madrasah only of classroom and some utility rooms is lacking. However, it was common practice that so-called madrasahs had no lecture rooms or, even if they had, no lectures had been given in them. These madrasahs were employed as student hospices.

Each of the four towers has different decorational motifs. Some say that elements of decoration reflect the four religions known to Central Asians. One can find elements reminiscent of a cross, a Christian fish motif, and a Buddhist praying-wheel, in addition to Zoroastrian and Islamic motifs. 
In 1995, due to an underground brook, one of the four towers collapsed and emergency assistance was applied for and granted by UNESCO under the World Heritage Fund. Although the collapse resulted in destabilizing the entire structure, the authorities were anxious to keep awareness of the disaster to a minimum. Without explanation the building disappeared from the list of sights and after hurried reconstruction of the tower &quot;using non-traditional building material, such as poor quality cement and steel&quot; Char Minar returned as one of the most popular sights of the city, yet the event has been kept secret ever since.

On the esplanade to the right from Char-Minar is a pool, likely of the same age as the rest of the building complex. Char Minar is now surrounded mainly by small houses and shops along its perimeter.

*Magok-i-Attari Mosque

The former Magoki Attori mosque was constructed in the 9th century on the remains of what may have been an older Zoroastrian temple. The mosque was destroyed and rebuilt more than once, and the oldest part now remaining is the south façade, which dates from the 12th century—making it one of the oldest surviving structures in Bukhara, and one of few which survived the onslaught of Genghis Khan. Lower than the surrounding ground level, the mosque was excavated in 1935. It no longer functions as a mosque, but, rather, houses a carpet museum.

*Mosque of Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani
In Bukhara there is a mosque which is said to be that of Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani, the patron saint of Kashmiri Muslims in the Valley of Kashmir.

*Shirbudun Palace
Shirbudun Palace (Uzbek: &quot;Shirbudun saroyi&quot;) is one of the Bukhara emirs&#x27; political building. The palace&#x27;s construction started approximately 1870, under the reign of Muzaffar bin Nasrullah (1860–1885) in the Bukhara Emirate.

*Bukhara Prison
Bukhara Prison is the prison of the Amir of Bukhara. The prison was built in the second half of the 18th century, during the Mangit dynasty, and is located in the northwest corner of the ancient city, in the vicinity of the Hoja Nizamiddin Bolo burial site, around a hundred meters northeast of the Ark fortress, dating back to the middle centuries.
*Jandi Turki Mausoleum 
Jandi Turki Mausoleum is situated on Namozgoh Street, in the old city section of Bukhara. The mausoleum is associated with Abu Nasr Ahmad ibn Fazl ibn Muso al-Muzakkir al-Jandi.

*Khanqah of Nodir Devonbegi
Nodir Devonbegi is a historical memorial in Bukhara, Uzbekistan. It was established by Nodir Devonbegi (Nodir Mirzo Togay ibn Sultan), the vizier and brother of the ruler of Bukhara, Imamquli Khan, around 1620–1621. The Khanaka has been included in the national list of intangible cultural heritage objects of Uzbekistan.

==Geography==
About west of Samarkand in south-central Uzbekistan, Bukhara is located on the Zeravshan River, at an elevation of .

=== Climate ===
Bukhara has a typically Central Asian cool arid climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;). The average maximum afternoon temperature in January is , rising to an average maximum of around in July. Mean annual precipitation is .

Water was important in the hot, dry climate of Central Asia, so from ancient times, irrigation farming was developed. Cities were built near rivers, and water channels were built to serve the entire city. Uncovered reservoirs, known as &quot;hauzes&quot;, were constructed. Special covered water reservoirs, or &quot;sardobas&quot;, were built along caravan routes to supply travelers and their animals with water.

However, the heavy use of agrochemicals during the Soviet era, diversion of irrigation water from the two rivers that feed Uzbekistan, and the lack of water treatment plants have caused health and environmental problems on a large scale.

==Transportation==

Bukhara International Airport has regularly scheduled flights to cities in Uzbekistan and Russia. The Turkmenistan border is about 80 km away with the nearest city there being Türkmenabat, connected via the M37 highway which continues to other places in Turkmenistan including Ashgabat. The city is also served by railroad links with the rest of Uzbekistan, and is a hub for roadways leading to all major cities in Uzbekistan and beyond, including Mazar-i-Sharif in Afghanistan via the M39 highway. The city of Samarkand is 215 km to the east of Bukhara.

===Internal transportation facilities===

Bukhara city is the largest transport hub after Tashkent in Uzbekistan. Inside the city there is facility of bus transportation. There are over 45 bus lines. Majority of them have been equipped with ISUZU buses but some buses are being brought from China. By the number of buses and bus routes facilities Bukhara is the largest after Tashkent in Uzbekistan.

==Demographics==

Bukhara recorded a population of 279,200 in 2019. Bukhara (along with Samarkand) is one of the two major centers of Uzbekistan&#x27;s Tajik minority. Bukhara was also home to the Bukharan Jews, whose ancestors settled in the city during Roman times. Most Bukharian Jews left Bukhara between 1925 and 2000.

Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda defines the name Bukhara itself as meaning &quot;full of knowledge&quot;, referring to the fact that in antiquity, Bukhara was a scientific and scholarship powerhouse.
In the Italian romantic epic &quot;Orlando innamorato&quot; by Matteo Maria Boiardo, Bukhara is called Albracca and described as a major city of Cathay. There, within its walled city and fortress, Angelica and the knights she has befriended make their stand when attacked by Agrican, emperor of Tartary. As described, this siege by Agrican resembles the historic siege by Genghis Khan in 1220.

=== Ethnic groups ===
According to the official statistics, the city&#x27;s population is 82% Uzbeks, 6% Russians, 4% Tajiks, 3% Tatars, 1% Koreans, 1% Turkmens, 1% Ukrainians, 2% of other ethnicities. However, official Uzbek numbers have for long been criticized and refuted by various observers and Western sources and it is widely assumed that the population of the city consists mainly of Tajik-speaking Tajiks, with ethnic Uzbeks forming a growing minority. Exact figures are difficult to evaluate, since many people in Uzbekistan either identify as &quot;Uzbek&quot; even though they speak Tajik as their first language, or because they are registered as Uzbeks by the central government despite their Tajik language and identity. According to Soviet estimates in the early 20th century (based on numbers from 1913 and 1917), the Tajiks formed the overwhelming majority of city.

=== Religion ===
The religion with the largest community of followers is Islam. But there are also Christian and Jewish minorities.

<text>Ejnar Hertzsprung (; 8 October 1873 – 21 October 1967) was a Danish chemist and astronomer. He is best remembered for his role in developing the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of stars.

==Career==
Hertzsprung was born in Frederiksberg, Denmark, the son of Severin and Henriette. He studied chemical engineering at Copenhagen Polytechnic Institute, graduating in 1898. After spending two years working as a chemist in St. Petersburg, in 1901 he studied photochemistry at Leipzig University for a year. His father was an amateur astronomer, which led to Ejnar&#x27;s interest in the subject. He began making astronomical observations in Frederiksberg in 1902, and within a few years had noticed that stars with similar spectral type could have widely different absolute magnitudes. In 1909, he took a position at the Göttingen Observatory under director Karl Schwarzschild.

In 1911 Hertzsprung developed the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, independently developed in 1913 by Henry Norris Russell.

In 1913 Hertzsprung determined the distances to several Cepheid variable stars by parallax, and was thus able to calibrate the relationship, discovered by Henrietta Leavitt, between Cepheid period and luminosity. In this determination he made a mistake, possibly a slip of the pen, putting the stars 10 times too close. He used this relationship to estimate the distance to the Small Magellanic Cloud. From 1919 to 1946, Hertzsprung worked at Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands, from 1937 as director. Among his graduate students at Leiden was Gerard Kuiper.

Perhaps his greatest contribution to astronomy was the development of a classification system for stars to divide them by spectral type, stage in their development, and luminosity. He used the earlier classification system developed by Antonia Maury in his work. The so-called &quot;Hertzsprung–Russell Diagram&quot; has been used ever since as a classification system to explain stellar types and stellar evolution. He also discovered two asteroids, one of which is 1627 Ivar, an Amor asteroid.

His wife Henrietta (1881–1956) was a daughter of the Dutch astronomer Jacobus Kapteyn. Hertzsprung died in Roskilde in 1967. The asteroid 1693 Hertzsprung was named in his honour.

<text>Jowett was a manufacturer of light cars and light commercial vehicles in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England from 1906 to 1954.

==Early history==
Jowett was founded in 1901 by brothers Benjamin (1877–1963) and William (1880–1965) Jowett with Arthur V. Lamb. They started in the cycle business and went on to make V-twin engines for driving machinery. Some early engines found their way locally into other makes of cars as replacements. In 1904 they became the &quot;Jowett Motor Manufacturing Company&quot; based in Back Burlington Street, Bradford. Their first Jowett light car was produced in February 1906 but as their little workshop was fully occupied with general engineering activities, experiments with different engine configurations, and making the first six Scott motorbikes, it did not go into production until 1910, and then after more than 25,000 miles of exhaustive trials.

Their intention was to provide a low weight vehicle at a low price and with low running costs. The prototype could be described as the United Kingdom&#x27;s first real light car. Engine and gearbox were specifically designed for a light car and made largely of aluminium. Its low speed torque and gear ratios were ideally suited to the hills about Bradford and Yorkshire&#x27;s terrain where poor roads provided little use for a high top speed or quick acceleration. Construction of the engine and the rest of the car was robust. Benjamin Jowett held that their light car class was suffering from engines either from cyclecars with sufficient power but subject to rapid deterioration because of inadequate bearing surfaces, or engines from larger cars too heavy for the rest of the car&#x27;s structure leading to a different set of troubles. The Jowett engine was designed and built for a light car.

The production car &quot;quickly became popular&quot;. It used an 816 cc flat twin water-cooled engine of 6.4 hp and three-speed gearbox with tiller steering. The body was a lightweight open two-seater. Learning popular opinion was that 10 hp was a minimum Jowett advertised their third car as being 8 hp without changing the specification. Twelve vehicles were made before an improved version with wheel steering was launched in 1913 and a further 36 were made before the outbreak of the First World War when the factory was turned over to munitions manufacture. Two tiller steerers still survive.

==Inter-war years==
Jowett Cars Limited was a new private company formed in June 1919 to make and sell motorcars and it purchased the car manufacturing portion of the business carried on by the Jowett Motor Manufacturing Company. It became a public company listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1935.

That year, 1919, a new works site was bought at Springfield, Bradford Road, Idle, outside Bradford, the site of a disused quarry. Car making started in the new factory in 1920. The first vehicle was the Jowett Seven using an enlarged version of the pre-war flat twin. First it was enlarged to 831 cc then to 907 cc in 1921 when the claim to 8 hp was dropped from advertising. Thereafter all Jowetts were Sevens until the introduction of the four-cylinder engine in 1936. The engine developed its maximum torque at low revs and was soon famed for its pulling power, reliability and economy.

Commercial vehicles based on the car chassis were also built from 1922 and became an increasingly important part of the company&#x27;s output. Jowett first exhibited at the London Motor Show in 1921 and gradually broke out of their previous local market. In 1923 coil ignition and electric starting were added and the four-seater &quot;Long Four&quot; was introduced in tourer form priced from £245 followed in 1925 by a closed saloon model, the previous short-chassis two-seater continuing in production. In 1929, the engine received removable cylinder heads to ease maintenance and braking was on all four wheels. Production was briefly suspended in September 1931 when fire swept through the works.

1933 saw the launch of the Jowett Kestrel with four-speed gearbox and in 1935 there was the oddly named Jowett Weasel sports tourer. The first four-cylinder (flat four) car arrived in 1936 with the 1166 cc twin carburettor Jowett Ten which continued until the outbreak of war alongside the traditional twin-cylinder models which grew to 946 cc in 1937. In 1935 the company went public and in 1936 Benjamin Jowett retired. Brother William carried on until 1940.

==Second World War==
Production of cars stopped in 1940 but engine production for motor-generator sets continued alongside aircraft components and other military hardware. The engine was (besides being used as a generator set) also used in the Jowett engine powered Fire Pump. The company was bought by property developer Charles Clore in 1945 and he sold it in 1947 to the bankers Lazard Brothers.

==Post-war==
When production restarted after the Second World War, the twin-cylinder engine was dropped from the range of new cars, but continued in 1005 cc form to the end of production in the commercial vehicles, now comprising a light lorry, the Bradford van, two versions of an estate car called the Utility, and chassis front-ends and kits for outside coachbuilders, many abroad. The new cars were a complete change from what had gone before with the streamlined Jowett Javelin designed by a team led by Gerald Palmer. This had such advanced features as a flat-four push-rod engine, independent front suspension with torsion bars front and rear, and unitary body construction. The car was good for and had excellent handling. In 1950 the Javelin was joined by the Jowett Jupiter sports car with a chassis designed by Eberan von Eberhorst who had worked for Auto Union. Javelins were designed for production levels never before attempted by Jowett. Javelin and Bradford body production was out-sourced to Briggs Motor Bodies, who built a new plant at Doncaster. Briggs supplied the bodies fully trimmed and ready to be applied to the mechanicals. The Jupiters were always built in-house at Idle. The new mechanicals had teething troubles, but Javelin bodies were still being mass-produced to the original schedule, leading to their being stockpiled. Export sales collapsed by 75 per cent in 1952 followed by sluggish domestic sales while the nation waited for the removal of a &quot;temporarily&quot; increased purchase tax, finally eased in April 1953, with disastrous long-term consequences for Jowett.
Poor business strategy and direction, and over-confidence, were the financially sound company&#x27;s downfall and, even after the engine and gearbox problems were solved, the Idle plant was never able to build, nor – during 1952 – was the distribution network able to sell, the expected volume. Collapse of the arrangements for the supply of bodies led to suspension of Javelin production in 1953, together with the by now outdated Bradford, though tooling had been completed for new models. Jupiters remained in demand and were built up to the end of 1954. The company did not go broke, but sold its factory to International Harvester who made tractors at the site until the early 1980s. The factory was demolished in 1983.

Jowett switched to manufacturing aircraft parts for the Blackburn &amp; General Aircraft Company in a former woollen mill at Howden Clough, Birstall, near Batley. Jowett, just the &quot;shell&quot; of the company, was later taken over by Blackburn in 1956, although spares for the postwar cars were kept available until 1963, when the remainder of the Jowett company was closed due to the rationalisation of the aircraft industry.

===Crisis and closure===

The purchase tax on new cars was reduced by 25 per cent on 15 April 1953 (from 66⅔ per cent to 50 per cent), which triggered a surge in demand for new cars on the UK market. In the resulting scramble for production facilities, Ford bought Briggs, whose new Doncaster plant built the unitary construction bodies and fully trimmed them for Jowett Javelin cars and Bradford vans. In April 1953, the Ford Motor Company Limited purchased from the US shareholders majority control of Briggs Motor Bodies Limited, whose main factory was adjacent to the Ford plant at Dagenham. Remaining minority shareholders were bought out, and Ford quickly acquired full ownership of the Briggs business. The Briggs factory at Doncaster was surplus to Ford&#x27;s requirements and it was sold to Fisher and Ludlow. Fisher and Ludlow itself was quickly swallowed up by the newly created British Motor Corporation.

At the beginning of July, the Chairman of Jowett Cars Limited, A.F. Jopling, who at the time was also a senior employee with Blackburn Aircraft, informed Jowett shareholders at their Annual General Meeting that difficulties had arisen over the future supply of car bodies. Negotiations were proceeding, but an interruption in delivery of completed vehicles appeared likely to occur in the closing months of that year. He also reported that exports for 1952 were almost 75 per cent down on 1951. On the home market, during the six-month run-up to tax changes in April 1953, the anticipated success of an organised campaign for a reduction in purchase tax had sharply reduced previously buoyant UK new car demand. Home market sales in the last quarter of 1952 were only 15 per cent of the sales in the three preceding quarters.

In mid-September the board advised shareholders that the forecast break in production was unavoidable, and that it might prove to be of considerable duration. Having regard to this possibility, negotiations extended to suitable alternative work which would keep the factory reasonably employed. It also advised that the difficulty in arranging supplies of new bodies would unfortunately postpone the production of the new range of commercial vehicles, and the estate car, which were fully tooled-up.

The business appeared to be running out of working capital and car production ceased.

In July 1954 it was announced that Jowett Cars Limited would sell its main factory at Idle to International Harvester, excluding plant and equipment needed for the service and spares departments.

A note was added by &quot;The Times&quot; that Jowett Cars had run into difficulties the previous year (1953), following the acquisition of the motor body suppliers Fisher and Ludlow by BMC, completed in September 1953. &quot;It is now stated that since the company ceased manufacturing Javelin and Bradford vehicles it has not been found possible to keep the main factory operating at an economic level.&quot; However Jowett Cars Limited reported a (small) profit for the financial year.

At the 35th Annual General Meeting in August 1954, the chairman advised the profound regret of the board and all associated with the company, including the users of the some 65,000 vehicles which had been made since 1946, for their joint circumstances.

Ultimately shareholders received back rather more than the nominal value of their shares. That process was completed in mid-1955.

==Clubs==
There are some eight Jowett club regions in the UK and very robust Australian and New Zealand groups, that exist to support and promote the Jowett. Members gather with their cars for sectional meetings and once a year, for a National Rally. Members and their cars from the USA and Europe have attended.
