<text>The Keller&#x27;s Mill Covered Bridge is a covered bridge that spans Cocalico Creek in Ephrata Township, Lancaster County in the US state of Pennsylvania. A county-owned and maintained bridge, its official designation is the Cocalico No. 5 Bridge. It is also sometimes known as the Guy Bard Covered Bridge (after a local jurist) and Rettew&#x27;s Covered Bridge (after the person for whom Rettew&#x27;s Road is named).

Due to heavy road traffic on the aging one-lane bridge, construction on a new steel and concrete bridge to bypass the covered bridge took place in the summer of 2006. According to Ephrata Township supervisor Clark Stauffer, the bridge has been disassembled and will be reassembled a few miles downstream to replace an existing one-,lane Middle Creek Road bridge. It was located at (40.16983, −76.20467) before being disassembled.

==History==
Keller&#x27;s Mill Covered Bridge was originally built by Elias McMellen in 1873 at a cost of US$2,075. After being swept away in flooding, the bridge was rebuilt in 1891, again by McMellen. It remained in place until it was disassembled and moved in 2006. The bridge was reconstructed in 2009 and reopened on Middle Creek Road in December 2010.

== Design ==
Keller&#x27;s Mill Covered Bridge has a single span, wooden, double Burr arch trusses design with the addition of steel hanger rods. The deck is made from oak planks. The bridge is the only all white bridge in the county, not red. In fact, just about all covered bridges were whitewashed both inside and out. the only bridge to have survived the transition from whitewashing to the red color commonly used in barns throughout the county. The bridge is not painted on the inside.

<text>The Kurtz&#x27;s Mill Covered Bridge is a covered bridge that spans Mill Creek in the Lancaster County Park in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. The bridge is also known as the County Park Covered Bridge, Baer&#x27;s Mill Covered Bridge, Isaac Baer&#x27;s Mill Bridge, Keystone Mill Covered Bridge, Binder Tongue Carrier Covered Bridge, and Mill 2A Covered Bridge. The bridge is accessible to road traffic from within the park.

The bridge has a single span, wooden, double burr arch trusses design with the addition of steel hanger rods. The deck is made from oak planks. It is painted red, the traditional color of Lancaster County covered bridges, on both the inside and outside. Both approaches to the bridge are painted in red with white trim.

The bridge&#x27;s WGCB Number is 38–36–03. Unlike most historic covered bridges in the county, it is not listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is located at (40.0151, -76.2822).

== History ==
The bridge was built in 1876 by W. W. Upp over the Conestoga River. In 
June 1972, it was damaged by the floodwaters caused by Hurricane Agnes. It was repaired by David Esh in 1975 and moved to its present location in the Lancaster County Park over Mill Creek, a tributary of the Conestoga River. Kurtz&#x27;s covered bridge was first constructed in 1876. It spans 94 feet long, this covered bridge once spanned the Conestoga River. But after the Flood of 72, it was moved to its present location across the Mill Creek in the Lancaster County Central Park and it was last rebuilt there in 1975.

<text>XPointer is a system for addressing components of XML-based Internet media. It is divided among four specifications: a &quot;framework&quot; that forms the basis for identifying XML fragments, a positional element addressing scheme, a scheme for namespaces, and a scheme for XPath-based addressing. XPointer Framework is a W3C recommendation since March 2003.

The XPointer language is designed to address structural aspects of XML, including text content and other information objects created as a result of parsing the document. Thus, it could be used to point to a section of a document highlighted by a user through a mouse drag action.

During development, and until 2016, XPointer was covered by a royalty-free technology patent held by Sun Microsystems.

== Positional element addressing ==
The codice_1 scheme introduces positional addressing of child elements. This is similar to a simple XPath address, but subsequent steps can only be numbers representing the position of a descendant relative to its branch on the tree.

For instance, given the following fragment:
&lt;foobar id=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;
 &lt;bar/&gt;
 &lt;baz&gt;
 &lt;bom a=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/baz&gt;
 &lt;bom a=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/foobar&gt;
results as the following examples:

 xpointer(id(&quot;foo&quot;)) =&gt; foobar
 xpointer(/foobar/1) =&gt; bar
 xpointer(//bom) =&gt; bom (a=1), bom (a=2)
 element(/1/2/1) =&gt; bom (a=1) (/1 descend into first element (foobar),
 /2 descend into second child element (baz),
 /1 select first child element (bom))

<doc id="85012" wikidata="Q49013" url="?curid=85012" title="Sewing machine">
<text>A sewing machine is a machine used to sew fabric and materials together with thread. Sewing machines were invented during the first Industrial Revolution to decrease the amount of manual sewing work performed in clothing companies. Since the invention of the first sewing machine, generally considered to have been the work of Englishman Thomas Saint in 1790, the sewing machine has greatly improved the efficiency and productivity of the clothing industry.

Home sewing machines are designed for one person to sew individual items while using a single stitch type at a time. In a modern sewing machine, the process of stitching has been automated, so that the fabric easily glides in and out of the machine. Early sewing machines were powered by either constantly turning a flywheel handle or with a foot-operated treadle mechanism. Electrically-powered machines were later introduced.

Industrial sewing machines, by contrast to domestic machines, are larger, faster, and more varied in their size, cost, appearance, and tasks.

== History ==

=== Invention ===

Charles Fredrick Wiesenthal, a German-born engineer working in England, was awarded the first British patent for a mechanical device to aid the art of sewing, in 1755. His invention consisted of a double pointed needle with an eye at one end.

In 1790, the English inventor Thomas Saint invented the first sewing machine design. His machine was meant to be used on leather and canvas material. It is likely that Saint had a working model, but there is no surviving evidence of one. He was a skilled cabinet maker and his device included many practical and functional features: an overhanging arm; a feed mechanism (adequate for short lengths of leather); a vertical needle bar; and a looper. Saint created the machine to reduce the amount of hand-stitching on garments, making sewing more reliable and functional.

His sewing machine used the chain stitch method, in which the machine uses a single thread to make simple stitches in the fabric. A stitching awl would have pierced the material, and a forked-point rod would have carried the thread through the hole, where it would have been hooked underneath and moved to the next stitching place, after which the cycle would be repeated, thereby locking the stitch in place. Saint&#x27;s machine was designed to aid in the manufacturing of various leather goods, including saddles and bridles, but it was also capable of working with canvas, and was used for sewing ship sails. Although his machine was very advanced for the era, the concept would need steady improvement over the coming decades before it was practical enough to enter into wide use. In 1874, a sewing machine manufacturer, William Newton Wilson, found Saint&#x27;s drawings in the UK Patent Office, made adjustments to the looper, and built a working machine, currently owned by the Science Museum in London.

In 1804, a sewing machine was built by two Englishmen, Thomas Stone and James Henderson, and a machine for embroidering was constructed by John Duncan in Scotland. An Austrian tailor, Josef Madersperger, began developing his first sewing machine in 1807 and presented his first working machine publicly in 1814. Having received financial support from his government, the Austrian tailor worked on the development of his machine until 1839, when he built a machine imitating the weaving process using the chain stitch.

The first practical and widely used sewing machine was invented by Barthélemy Thimonnier, a French tailor, in 1829. His machine sewed straight seams using a chain stitch like Saint&#x27;s model had, and in 1830, he signed a contract with Auguste Ferrand, a mining engineer, who made the requisite drawings and submitted a patent application. The patent for his machine was issued on 17 July 1830, and in the same year, he and his partners opened the first machine-based clothing manufacturing company in the world to create army uniforms for the French Army. However, the factory was burned down, reportedly by workers fearful of losing their livelihood, following the issuing of the patent. A model of the machine is exhibited in London at the Science Museum. The machine is made of wood and uses a barbed needle which passes downward through the cloth to grab the thread and pull it up to form a loop to be locked by the next loop.

The first American lockstitch sewing machine was invented by Walter Hunt in 1832. His machine used a needle with the eye and the point on the same end carrying the upper thread, and a falling shuttle carrying the lower thread. The curved needle moved through the fabric horizontally, leaving the loop as it withdrew. The shuttle passed through the loop, interlocking the thread. The feed was unreliable, requiring the machine to be stopped frequently and reset up. Hunt eventually lost interest in his machine and sold individual machines without bothering to patent his invention, and only patenting it at a late date of 1854. In 1842, John Greenough patented the first sewing machine in the United States. The British partners Newton and Archibold introduced the eye-pointed needle and the use of two pressing surfaces to keep the pieces of fabric in position, in 1841.

The first machine to combine all the disparate elements of the previous half-century of innovation into the modern sewing machine was the device built by English inventor John Fisher in 1844, a little earlier than the very similar machines built by Isaac Merritt Singer in 1851, and the lesser known Elias Howe, in 1845. However, due to the botched filing of Fisher&#x27;s patent at the Patent Office, he did not receive due recognition for the modern sewing machine in the legal disputations of priority with Singer, and Singer reaped the benefits of the patent.

=== Industrial competition ===
Elias Howe, born in Spencer, Massachusetts, created his sewing machine in 1845, using a similar method to Fisher&#x27;s except that the fabric was held vertically. An important improvement on his machine was to have the needle running away from the point, starting from the eye. After a lengthy stay in England trying to attract interest in his machine, he returned to America to find various people infringing his patent, among them Isaac Merritt Singer. He eventually won a case for patent infringement in 1854 and was awarded the right to claim royalties from the manufacturers using ideas covered by his patent, including Singer.

Singer had seen a rotary sewing machine being repaired in a Boston shop. As an engineer, he thought it was clumsy and decided to design a better one. The machine he devised used a falling shuttle instead of a rotary one; the needle was mounted vertically and included a presser foot to hold the cloth in place. It had a fixed arm to hold the needle and included a basic tension system. This machine combined elements of Thimonnier, Hunt and Howe&#x27;s machines. Singer was granted an American patent in 1851. The foot treadle used since the Middle Ages, used to convert reciprocating to rotary motion, was adapted to drive the sewing machine, leaving both hands free.

When Howe learned of Singer&#x27;s machine he took him to court, where Howe won and Singer was forced to pay a lump sum for all machines already produced. Singer then took out a license under Howe&#x27;s patent and paid him US$1.15 per machine before entering into a joint partnership with a lawyer named Edward Clark. They created the first hire-purchase arrangement to allow people to purchase their machines through payments over time.

Meanwhile, Allen B. Wilson developed a shuttle that reciprocated in a short arc, which was an improvement over Singer and Howe&#x27;s. However, John Bradshaw had patented a similar device and threatened to sue, so Wilson decided to try a new method. He went into partnership with Nathaniel Wheeler to produce a machine with a rotary hook instead of a shuttle. This was far quieter and smoother than other methods, with the result that the Wheeler &amp; Wilson Company produced more machines in the 1850s and 1860s than any other manufacturer. Wilson also invented the four-motion feed mechanism that is still used on every sewing machine today. This had a forward, down, back and up motion, which drew the cloth through in an even and smooth motion. Charles Miller patented the first machine to stitch buttonholes. Throughout the 1850s more and more companies were being formed, each trying to sue the others for patent infringement. This triggered a patent thicket known as the Sewing Machine War.

In 1856, the Sewing Machine Combination was formed, consisting of Singer, Howe, Wheeler, Wilson, and Grover and Baker. These four companies pooled their patents, with the result that all other manufacturers had to obtain a license for $15 per machine. This lasted until 1877 when the last patent expired.

James Edward Allen Gibbs (1829–1902), a farmer from Raphine in Rockbridge County, Virginia, patented the first chain stitch single-thread sewing machine on June 2, 1857. In partnership with James Willcox, Gibbs became a principal partner in Willcox &amp; Gibbs Sewing Machine Company. Willcox &amp; Gibbs commercial sewing machines are still used in the 21st century, with spares parts available.

=== Market expansion ===
William Jones started making sewing machines in 1859 and in 1860 formed a partnership with Thomas Chadwick. As Chadwick &amp; Jones, they manufactured sewing machines at Ashton-under-Lyne, England until 1863. Their machines used designs from Howe and Wilson produced under licence. Thomas Chadwick later joined Bradbury &amp; Co. William Jones opened a factory in Guide Bridge, Manchester in 1869. In 1893 a Jones advertising sheet claimed that this factory was the &quot;Largest Factory in England Exclusively Making First Class Sewing Machines&quot;. The firm was renamed as the Jones Sewing Machine Co. Ltd and was later acquired by Brother Industries of Japan, in 1968.

Clothing manufacturers were the first sewing machine customers, and used them to produce the first ready-to-wear clothing and shoes. In the 1860s consumers began purchasing them, and the machines—ranging in price from £6 to £15 in Britain depending on features—became very common in middle-class homes. Owners were much more likely to spend free time with their machines to make and mend clothing for their families than to visit friends, and women&#x27;s magazines and household guides such as &quot;Mrs Beeton&#x27;s&quot; offered dress patterns and instructions. A sewing machine could produce a man&#x27;s shirt in about one hour, compared to hours by hand.

In 1877, the world&#x27;s first crochet machine was invented and patented by Joseph M. Merrow, then-president of what had started in the 1840s, as a machine shop to develop specialized machinery for the knitting operations. This crochet machine was the first production overlock sewing machine. The Merrow Machine Company went on to become one of the largest American manufacturers of overlock sewing machines and remains in the 21st century as the last American over-lock sewing machine manufacturer.

In 1885 Singer patented the Singer Vibrating Shuttle sewing machine, which used Allen B. Wilson&#x27;s idea for a vibrating shuttle and was a better lockstitcher than the oscillating shuttles of the time. Millions of the machines, perhaps the world&#x27;s first really practical sewing machine for domestic use, were produced until finally superseded by rotary shuttle machines in the 20th century. Sewing machines continued being made to roughly the same design—with more lavish decoration—until well into the 1900s.

The first electric machines were developed by Singer Sewing Co. and introduced in 1889. By the end of the First World War, Singer was offering hand, treadle and electric machines for sale. At first, the electric machines were standard machines with a motor strapped on the side, but as more homes gained power, they became more popular, and the motor was gradually introduced into the casing.

=== Introduction of electronic machines ===
Sewing machines were strictly mechanical, using gears, shafts, levers, and so on, until the 1970s when electronic machines were introduced to the market. Electronic sewing machines incorporate components such as circuit boards, computer chips, and additional motors for independent control of machine functions. These electronic components enabled new features such as automating thread cutters, needle positioning, and back-tacking, as well as digitized stitch patterns and stitch combinations. Because of the lifespan and increased complexity of the electronic parts, electronic sewing machines do not last as long as mechanical sewing machines, which can last over 100 years.

== Stitches ==
Sewing machines can make a great variety of plain or patterned stitches. Ignoring strictly decorative aspects, over three dozen distinct stitch formations are formally recognized by the ISO 4915:1991 standard, involving one to seven separate threads to form the stitch.

Plain stitches fall into four general categories: chainstitch, lockstitch, overlock, and coverstitch.

Chain stitch was used by early sewing machines and has two major drawbacks:

* The stitch is not self-locking, and if the thread breaks at any point or is not tied at both ends, the whole length of stitching comes out. It is also easily ripped out.
* The direction of sewing cannot be changed much from one stitch to the next, or the stitching process fails.

A better stitch was found in the lockstitch. The chain stitch is still used today in clothing manufacture, though due to its major drawbacks, it is generally paired with an overlock stitch along the same seam.

Lockstitch is the familiar stitch performed by most household sewing machines and most industrial &quot;single needle&quot; sewing machines, using two threads, one passed through a needle and one coming from a bobbin or shuttle. Each thread stays on its own side of the material while being sewn, interlacing with the other thread at each needle hole by means of a bobbin driver. As a result, a lockstitch can be formed anywhere on the material being sewn; it does not need to be near an edge.

Overlock, also known as &quot;serging&quot; or &quot;serger stitch&quot;, can be formed with two to four threads, one or two needles, and one or two loopers. Overlock sewing machines are usually equipped with knives that trim or create the edge immediately in front of the stitch formation. Household and industrial overlock machines are commonly used for garment seams in knit or stretchy fabrics, for garment seams where the fabric is light enough that the seam does not need to be pressed open, and for protecting edges against raveling. Machines using two to four threads are most common, and frequently one machine can be configured for several varieties of overlock stitch. Overlock machines with five or more threads usually make both a chainstitch with one needle and one looper, and an overlock stitch with the remaining needles and loopers. This combination is known as a &quot;safety stitch&quot;. A similar machine used for stretch fabrics is called a &quot;mock safety&quot;.

Coverstitch is formed by two or more needles and one or two loopers. Like lockstitch and chainstitch, coverstitch can be formed anywhere on the material being sewn. One looper manipulates a thread below the material being sewn, forming a bottom cover stitch against the needle threads. An additional looper above the material can form a top cover stitch simultaneously. The needle threads form parallel rows, while the looper threads cross back and forth all the needle rows. Coverstitch is so-called because the grid of crossing needle and looper threads covers raw seam edges, much as the overlock stitch does. It is widely used in garment construction, particularly for attaching trims and flat seaming where the raw edges can be finished in the same operation as forming the seam.

A zigzag stitch is a variant geometry of the lockstitch. It is a back-and-forth stitch used where a straight stitch will not suffice, such as in preventing raveling of a fabric, in stitching stretchable fabrics, and in temporarily joining two work pieces edge-to-edge. When creating a zigzag stitch, the back-and-forth motion of the sewing machine&#x27;s needle is controlled by a cam. As the cam rotates, a fingerlike follower that is connected to the needle bar rides along the cam and tracks its indentations. As the follower moves in and out, the needle bar is moved from side to side. Very old sewing machines lack this hardware and so cannot natively produce a zigzag stitch, but there are often shank-driven attachments available which enable them to do so.

== Feed mechanisms ==
Besides the basic motion of needles, loopers and bobbins, the material being sewn must move so that each cycle of needle motion involves a different part of the material. This motion is known as feed, and sewing machines have almost as many ways of feeding material as they do of forming stitches. For general categories, there are: drop feed, needle feed, walking foot, puller, and manual. Often, multiple types of feed are used on the same machine. Besides these general categories, there are also uncommon feed mechanisms used in specific applications like edge joining fur, making seams on caps, and blind stitching.

The drop feed mechanism is used by almost all household machines and involves a mechanism below the sewing surface of the machine. When the needle is withdrawn from the material being sewn, a set of &quot;feed dogs&quot; is pushed up through slots in the machine surface, then dragged horizontally past the needle. The dogs are serrated to grip the material, and a &quot;presser foot&quot; is used to keep the material in contact with the dogs. At the end of their horizontal motion, the dogs are lowered again and returned to their original position while the needle makes its next pass through the material. While the needle is in the material, there is no feed action. Almost all household machines and the majority of industrial machines use drop feed.

Differential feed is a variation of drop feed with two independent sets of dogs, one before and one after the needle. By changing their relative motions, these sets of dogs can be used to stretch or compress the material in the vicinity of the needle. This is extremely useful when sewing stretchy material, and overlock machines (heavily used for such materials) frequently have differential feed.

A needle feed, used only in industrial machines, moves the material while the needle is in the material. In fact, the needle may be the primary feeding force. Some implementations of needle feed rock the axis of needle motion back and forth, while other implementations keep the axis vertical while moving it forward and back. In both cases, there is no feed action while the needle is out of the material. Needle feed is often used in conjunction with a modified drop feed, and is very common on industrial two needle machines. Most household machines do not use needle feed.

A walking foot replaces the stationary presser foot with one that moves along with whatever other feed mechanisms the machine already has. As the walking foot moves, it shifts the workpiece along with it. It is most useful for sewing heavy materials where needle feed is mechanically inadequate, for spongy or cushioned materials where lifting the foot out of contact with the material helps in the feeding action, and for sewing many layers together where a drop feed will cause the lower layers to shift out of position with the upper layers.

Some factory machines and a few household machines are set up with an auxiliary &quot;puller feed&quot;, which grips the material being sewn (usually from behind the needles) and pulls it with a force and reliability usually not possible with other types of feed. Puller feeds are seldom built directly into the basic sewing machine. Their action must be synchronized with the needle and feed action built into the machine to avoid damaging the machine. Pullers are also limited to straight seams, or very nearly so. Despite their additional cost and limitations, pulling feeds are very useful when making large heavy items like tents and vehicle covers.

A manual feed is used primarily in freehand embroidery, quilting, and shoe repair. With manual feed, the stitch length and direction is controlled entirely by the motion of the material being sewn. Frequently some form of hoop or stabilizing material is used with fabric to keep the material under proper tension and aid in moving it around. Most household machines can be set for manual feed by disengaging the drop feed dogs. Most industrial machines can not be used for manual feed without actually removing the feed dogs.

== Needles ==
Sewing machines use special needles tailored to their needs and to the character of the material being sewn.

Modern sewing machines may be equipped with a needle guard. Needle guards are a safety measure that are used to help avoid injuries.

== Tension ==

Tension in a sewing machine refers to the pull of the thread between the needle and the bobbin. Sewing machines have tension discs and a tension regulator. If the stitch is too saggy or too tight, the most likely cause is a tension problem.

== Industrial versus domestic ==
There are mainly two types of sewing machines available: industrial and domestic. Industrial sewing machines are larger, faster, and more varied in their size, cost, appearance, and task. An industrial sewing machine can handle heavy-duty sewing jobs. Industrial machines, unlike domestic machines, perform a single dedicated task and are capable of continuous use for long periods; they have larger moving parts and larger motors rated for continuous operation. Parts for different industrial machines, such as motors, sewing feet, and bobbins may be interchangeable, but this is not always so.

The motors on industrial machines, as with most of their components, lights, etc., are separate, usually mounted to the underside of the table. Domestic machines have their OEM motors mounted inside the machine. There are two different types of motor available for industrial machines: a servo motor (which uses less electricity and is silent when not in use), and the more traditional clutch motor (which is always spinning, even when not in use).

A clutch motor is always running and making noises when it is connected to electricity. The constant operation ensures consistency and speed.

The servo motor uses less electricity than a clutch motor. It does not make any sound unless the operator hits the pedal on the machine, but it cannot withstand the same kind of use as a clutch motor.

== Social impact ==

Before sewing machines were invented women spent much of their time maintaining their family&#x27;s clothing. Middle-class housewives, even with the aid of a hired seamstress, would devote several days of each month to this task. It took an experienced seamstress at least 14 hours to make a dress shirt for a man; a woman&#x27;s dress took 10 hours; and a pair of summer trousers took nearly three hours. Most people except the very well-off would have only two sets of clothing: a work outfit and a Sunday outfit.

Sewing machines reduced the time for making a dress shirt to an hour and 15 minutes; the time to make a dress to an hour; and the time for a pair of summer pants to 38 minutes. This reduced labor resulted in women having a diminished role in household management, and allowed more hours for their own leisure as well as the ability to seek more employment.

Industrial use of sewing machines further reduced the burden placed upon housewives, moving clothing production from housewives and seamstresses to large-scale factories. The movement to large-scale factories resulted in a great increase in productivity; fewer workers could produce the same amount of clothing, reducing clothing prices significantly. As supply increased, prices also dropped.

While many middle-class women enjoyed increased leisure during the Victorian era, working-class women faced intensifying demands, particularly in the clothing industry. The invention of the sewing machine, which revolutionized garment production, brought longer working hours for seamstresses, especially during peak times of the year when wealthy customers placed orders in preparation for &quot;the Season”—the high point of the fashion season. Many women worked a minimum of eighteen hours, and sometimes up to twenty hours a day, particularly those employed by high-end London retailers. Despite the technological advancements, the industry’s seasonality left women with low wages during peak periods and no income for much of the year. Faced with such economic instability, some women turned to prostitution to survive.

This moral and economic tension extended to broader societal concerns. A challenge working-class women in the textile industry often faced was the notion that factory work could lead to moral decline, fueling fears of widespread prostitution. This anxiety was reflected in literature of the time, with several novels depicting female characters who fell into prostitution after entering factory work. Often, these narratives attributed their downfall to spending wages on ‘finery’ or clothing, which was seen as fostering vanity and eventual vice. Elizabeth Gaskell’s &quot;Mary Barton&quot; (1848), set in Manchester, exemplifies these themes. From the 1840s to the 1920s, such questions about the relationship between the clothing women wore and the clothing they made generated moral panics. Works like Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s &quot;Sybil&quot; (1845), Theodore Dreiser&#x27;s &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; (1900), Emile Zola&#x27;s &quot;Au Bonheur des Dames&quot; (1883), and Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s &quot;Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes&quot; (1847) similarly explored these themes.

Adding to these discussions was the influence of William Acton, a Parisian-trained British doctor who argued that one of the primary causes of prostitution was women’s excessive love of finery, or clothing. Acton suggested that this &quot;vanity&quot; drove women into prostitution, although historians debate whether he meant that women engaged in prostitution to buy fashionable clothing or that admiration for the attire worn by prostitutes led them into the practice. Public debates surrounding the Contagious Disease Acts of 1864 and 1866 highlighted opposing views. For instance, Lucy Bull, a matron from the Royal Albert Hospital, rejected Acton’s moralistic interpretation and instead attributed prostitution to the poverty many women faced.

Such interpretations reflect broader societal anxieties about women’s labor and morality during this period. Helen Rogers (1997) observes that by midcentury, the needlewoman had become an iconic figure in the Victorian imagination. She symbolized isolation, sexuality, single women’s work, wealthy women’s vanity, and even prostitution, blending labor and morality in complex ways. This perception of seamstresses often mirrored broader concerns about women working outside the home and the implications for societal norms.

Pam Inder (2015) highlights that such concerns fueled a push for men to receive higher wages, enabling women to remain at home and reinforcing the Victorian belief that women should not work for pay outside the domestic sphere. However, seamstresses, a dominant segment of working women, remained at the center of these tensions. Their work was frequently viewed negatively, symbolizing a broader fear of women’s growing participation in the workforce and its perceived moral risks.

Despite these societal ideals, the economic reality of women’s work remained stark. Louise Tilly and Joan Scott (1987) note that nearly half of women workers in England held manufacturing jobs in 1851. Crucially, 40 percent of these women worked from home, performing non-mechanized outwork or slop-work, which was cheap, ready-made clothing. Home-based production offered significant advantages to the garment industry, allowing it to rely on cheap, flexible labor. The long-standing association of needlework with women’s work reinforced this gendered division of labor, enabling industry leaders to exploit a vast network of low-cost laborers. Even as garment factories emerged in the 1850s, the industry continued to combine factory production with sweatshops and home-based labor, maintaining an exploitative and gendered system.

At the same time, economic pressures frequently forced working-class families to defy legal efforts to keep children in school. Mid-19th-century laws sought to regulate child labor and prioritize education, but these initiatives often conflicted with the realities faced by rural families. Many parents sent their daughters to work for wages, often far from home, as a necessary means of survival. For working-class women, labor in the textile industry thus became both a necessity and a source of moral scrutiny, reflecting the tensions between societal ideals and economic imperatives.

Many of the women who had previously been busy at home could now seek employment in factories, increasing the income for their family. This allowed families to be able to afford more sets of clothing and items than they previously could. For seamstresses, home sewing machines allowed them to produce clothing for the average person during periods when demand for fitted clothes was low, effectively increasing their earnings. When industrial sewing machines initially became popular many seamstresses, either working in factories or from home, lost their jobs as fewer workers could now produce the same output. In the long run these now unemployed skilled workers along with thousands of men and children would eventually be able to gain employment in jobs created as the clothing industry grew.

The sewing machine&#x27;s effects on the clothing industry resulted in major changes for other industries as well. Cotton production needed to increase in order to match the demand of the new clothing factories. As a result, cotton became planted in new areas where it had not previously been farmed. Other industries involved in the process benefited as well such as metal companies who provided parts for the machines, and shippers to move the increased amounts of goods. In addition to being important for clothing production, sewing machines also became important in the manufacturing of furniture with upholstery, curtains and towels, toys, books, and many other products.

<text>Rhea (or Rea) Silvia (), also known as Ilia, (as well as other names) was the mythical mother of the twins Romulus and Remus, who founded the city of Rome. This event was portrayed numerous times in Roman art. Her story is told in the first book of &quot;Ab Urbe Condita Libri&quot; of Livy and in Cassius Dio&#x27;s &quot;Roman History&quot;. The Legend of Rhea Silvia recounts how she was raped by Mars while she was a Vestal Virgin, resulting in the twins, as mentioned in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; and the works of Ovid.

== Legend ==

According to Livy&#x27;s account of the legend, she was the daughter of Numitor, king of Alba Longa, and descended from Aeneas. Numitor&#x27;s younger brother Amulius seized the throne and killed Numitor&#x27;s son, then forced Rhea Silvia to become a Vestal Virgin, a priestess of the goddess Vesta. As Vestal Virgins were sworn to celibacy, this would ensure the line of Numitor had no heirs. Rhea, however, became pregnant with the twins Romulus and Remus by the god Mars.

According to Plutarch, she believed this because she saw her children being cared for by a woodpecker and a wolf – animals sacred to Mars. The account says that Rhea Silvia went to a grove sacred to Mars to get water for use in the temple where she encountered Mars who attempted to rape her, she ran into a cave to escape him but to no avail. Mars then promised that her children would be great. These claims of her children&#x27;s paternity were later doubted by the Roman historian Livy.

Vesta, to show her displeasure at the birth of Rhea Silvia&#x27;s children, caused the holy fire in her temple to go out, shook her altar, and shut the eyes of her image. According to Ennius, the goddess Venus was more sympathetic to Rhea Silvia&#x27;s plight.
When Amulius learned of the birth he imprisoned Rhea Silvia and ordered a servant to kill the twins. But the servant showed mercy and set them adrift on the river Tiber, which, overflowing, left the infants in a pool by the bank. There, a she-wolf (&quot;lupa&quot;), who had just lost her own cubs, suckled them. Rhea Silvia was herself spared from death due to the intercession of Amulius&#x27; daughter Antho. According to Ovid, Rhea Silvia ultimately threw herself into the Tiber.

Romulus and Remus overthrew Amulius and reinstated Numitor as king in 752 BCE. They would then go to found Rome.

== In Roman art ==

Despite Livy&#x27;s euhemerist and realist deflation of this myth, it is clear that the story of her seduction by Mars continued to be widely accepted. This is demonstrated by the recurring theme of Mars discovering Rhea Silvia in Roman arts: In bas-relief on the Casali Altar (Vatican Museums), in engraved couched glass on the Portland Vase (British Museum), or on a sarcophagus in the Palazzo Mattei. Mars&#x27; discovery of Rhea Silvia is a prototype of the &quot;invention scene&quot; (&quot;discovery scene&quot;) familiar in Roman art; Greek examples are furnished by Dionysus and Ariadne or Selene and Endymion.

The Portland Vase features a scene that has been interpreted as a depiction of the &quot;invention&quot;, or coming-upon, of Rhea Sylvia by Mars.

In the Museo Nazionale Romano there is a depiction of Rhea Silvia sleeping during the conception of Romulus and Remus in a Relief.

== In Roman literature ==
In a version presented by Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot;, it is the river Anio who takes pity on her and invites her to rule his realm.

In Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Anchises gives a prophecy that Rhea Silvia would give birth to Romulus and Remus by Mars.

Rhea Silvia&#x27;s bearing of Romulus is mentioned in the Roman work, &quot;Vigil of Venus&quot;. 

== Academic analyses ==
* In an article by Rosanna Lauriola, Rhea Silvia is held up as an example of how rape victims in Roman myths are valued more as the mothers and catalysts for change than as individuals in their own right.
* A paper by Revika Gersht and Sonia Muryink divides the images of Rhea Silvia&#x27;s conception by Mars into as many as seven different types.

== Modern literature ==
* In David Drake&#x27;s science fiction story &quot;To Bring the Light&quot;, the time travelling protagonist meets a completely human Rhea Silvia, a sympathetic peasant living in a small shepherd community on Palatine Hill in what would become the city of Rome.
* In Rick Riordan&#x27;s novel &quot;The Mark of Athena&quot;, Annabeth Chase meets Rhea Silvia and the god of the river Tiber in the forms of Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck&#x27;s characters from the movie &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;.
* Rhea Silvia is the central character in Debra May Macleod&#x27;s historical fiction novel &quot;Rhea Silvia&quot; (2022).

<text>In Roman mythology, King Numitor () of Alba Longa was the maternal grandfather of Rome&#x27;s founder and first king, Romulus, and his twin brother Remus. He was the son of Procas, descendant of Aeneas the Trojan, and father of the twins&#x27; mother, Rhea Silvia, and Lausus.

In 794 BC Procas died and was meant to be succeeded by Numitor. Instead he was overthrown and removed from the kingdom by his brother, Amulius, who had no respect for his father&#x27;s will or his brother&#x27;s seniority. Amulius also murdered Numitor&#x27;s sons, in an effort to remove power from his brother for himself.

Rhea Silvia was made a Vestal Virgin by Amulius, rendering her unable to have children on pain of death; however, according to myth, she was forcibly impregnated by the god Mars. Romulus and Remus overthrew Amulius and reinstated Numitor as king in 752 BC.

<doc id="85023" wikidata="Q93332" url="?curid=85023" title="Appalachian Mountains">
<text>The Appalachian Mountains, often called the Appalachians, are a mountain range in eastern to northeastern North America. The term &quot;Appalachian&quot; refers to several different regions associated with the mountain range, and its surrounding terrain. The general definition used is one followed by the United States Geological Survey and the Geological Survey of Canada to describe the respective countries&#x27; physiographic regions. The U.S. uses the term Appalachian Highlands and Canada uses the term Appalachian Uplands; the Appalachian Mountains are not synonymous with the Appalachian Plateau, which is one of the provinces of the Appalachian Highlands.

The Appalachian range runs from the Island of Newfoundland in Canada, southwestward to Central Alabama in the United States; south of Newfoundland, it crosses the 96-square-mile (248.6 km2) archipelago of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, an overseas collectivity of France, meaning it is technically in three countries. The highest peak of the mountain range is Mount Mitchell in North Carolina at , which is also the highest point in the United States east of the Mississippi River.

The range is older than the other major mountain range in North America, the Rocky Mountains of the west. Some of the outcrops in the Appalachians contain rocks formed during the Precambrian era. The geologic processes that led to the formation of the Appalachian Mountains started 1.1 billion years ago. The first mountain range in the region was created when the continents of Laurentia and Amazonia collided, creating a supercontinent called Rodinia. The collision of these continents caused the rocks to be folded and faulted, creating the first mountains in the region. Many of the rocks and minerals that were formed during that event can currently be seen at the surface of the present Appalachian range. Around 480 million years ago, geologic processes began that led to three distinct orogenic eras that created much of the surface structure seen in today&#x27;s Appalachians. During this period, mountains once reached elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rockies before natural erosion occurred over the last 240 million years leading to what is present today.

The Appalachian Mountains are a barrier to east–west travel, as they form a series of alternating ridgelines and valleys oriented in opposition to most highways and railroads running east–west. This barrier was extremely important in shaping the expansion of the United States in the colonial era. 
The range is the home of a very popular recreational feature, the Appalachian Trail. This is a hiking trail that runs all the way from Mount Katahdin in Maine to Springer Mountain in Georgia, passing over or past a large part of the Appalachian range. The International Appalachian Trail is an extension of this hiking trail into the Canadian portion of the Appalachian range in New Brunswick and Quebec.

==Etymology==
While exploring inland along the northern coast of Florida in 1528, the members of the Narváez expedition, including Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, found a Native American village near present-day Tallahassee, Florida, whose name they transcribed as &quot;Apalchen&quot; or &quot;Apalachen&quot; . The name was soon altered by the Spanish to Apalachee and used as a name for the tribe and region spreading well inland to the north. Pánfilo de Narváez&#x27;s expedition first entered Apalachee territory on June 15, 1528, and applied the name. Now spelled &quot;Appalachian&quot;, it is the fourth-oldest surviving European place-name in the US.

After the 1540 expedition of Hernando de Soto, Spanish cartographers began to apply the name of the tribe to the mountains themselves. The first cartographic appearance of &quot;Apalchen&quot; is on Diego Gutiérrez&#x27;s map of 1562; the first use for the mountain range is the map of Jacques le Moyne de Morgues in 1565.

The name was not commonly used for the whole mountain range until the late 19th century. A competing and often more popular name was the &quot;Allegheny Mountains&quot;, &quot;Alleghenies&quot;, and even &quot;Alleghania&quot;. In the early 19th century, Washington Irving proposed renaming the United States either Appalachia or Alleghania.

In U.S. dialects in most regions of the Appalachians, the word is pronounced , with the third syllable sounding like &quot;latch&quot;. In some northern parts of the mountain range, particularly Pennsylvania, it is pronounced or ; the third syllable is like &quot;lay&quot;, and the fourth &quot;chins&quot; or &quot;shins&quot;. There is often great debate between the residents of the regions regarding the correct pronunciation. Elsewhere, a commonly accepted pronunciation for the adjective &quot;Appalachian&quot; is , with the last two syllables &quot;-ian&quot; pronounced as in the word &quot;Romanian&quot;.
==Geography==

Perhaps partly because the range runs through large portions of both the United States and Canada, and partly because the range was formed over numerous geologic time periods, one of which is sometimes termed the Appalachian orogeny, writing communities struggle to agree on an encyclopedic definition of the mountain range. However, each of the governments has an agency that informs the public about the major landforms that make up the countries, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC). The landforms are referred to as physiographic regions. The regions create precise boundaries from which maps can be drawn. The Appalachian Highlands is the name of one of the eight physiographic regions of the contiguous 48 United States.
The Appalachian Uplands is the name of one of seven physiographic regions of Canada.

===Appalachian Highlands of the United States===

The second level in the physiographic classification schema for the USGS is &quot;province&quot;, the same word as Canada uses to divide its political subdivisions, meaning that the terminology used by the two countries do not match below the region level. The lowest level of classification is &quot;section&quot;.

===Appalachian Uplands of Canada===
The Appalachian Uplands are one of the seven physiographic divisions in Canada. Canada&#x27;s GSC does not use the same classification system as the USGS below the division level. The agency does break the divisions of the Appalachian Uplands into 13 subsections that are in four different political provinces of Canada.

While the Appalachian Highlands and Appalachian Uplands are generally continuous across the U.S./Canadian border, the St. Lawrence Valley area is handled differently in the physiographic classification schemas. The part of the St. Lawrence Valley in the United States is one of the second-level classifications, part of the Appalachian Highlands. In Canada, the area is part of the first-level classification, the St. Lawrence Lowlands. This includes the area around the city of Montreal, Anticosti Island, and the northwest coastline of Newfoundland. 
The dissected plateau area, while not actually made up of geological mountains, is popularly called &quot;mountains&quot;, especially in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia, and while the ridges are not high, the terrain is extremely rugged. In Ohio and New York, some of the plateau has been glaciated, which has rounded off the sharp ridges and filled the valleys to some extent. The glaciated regions are usually referred to as hill country rather than mountains.

===Range characteristics===

The Appalachian belt includes the plateaus sloping southward to the Atlantic Ocean in New England, and southeastward to the border of the coastal plain through the central and southern Atlantic states; and on the northwest, the Allegheny and Cumberland plateaus declining toward the Great Lakes and the interior plains. A remarkable feature of the belt is the longitudinal chain of broad valleys, including the Great Appalachian Valley, which in the southerly sections divides the mountain system into two unequal portions, but in the northernmost lies west of all the ranges possessing typical Appalachian features, and separates them from the Adirondack group. The mountain system has no axis of dominating altitudes, but in every portion, the summits rise to rather uniform heights, and, especially in the central section, the various ridges and intermontane valleys have the same trend as the system itself. None of the summits reaches the region of perpetual snow.

In Pennsylvania, there are over sixty summits that rise over ; the summits of Mount Davis and Blue Knob rise over . In Maryland, Eagle Rock and Dans Mountain are conspicuous points reaching respectively. On the same side of the Great Valley, south of the Potomac, are the Pinnacle and Pidgeon Roost . In West Virginia, more than 150 peaks rise above , including Spruce Knob , the highest point in the Allegheny Mountains. A number of other points in the state rise above . Cheat Mountain (Snowshoe Mountain) at Thorny Flat and Bald Knob are among the more notable peaks in West Virginia.

The Blue Ridge Mountains, rising in southern Pennsylvania and there known as South Mountain, attain elevations of about in Pennsylvania. South Mountain achieves its highest point just below the Mason-Dixon line in Maryland at Quirauk Mountain and then diminishes in height southward to the Potomac River. Once in Virginia, the Blue Ridge again reaches and higher. In the Virginia Blue Ridge, the following are some of the highest peaks north of the Roanoke River: Stony Man , Hawksbill Mountain , Apple Orchard Mountain and Peaks of Otter . South of the Roanoke River, along the Blue Ridge, are Virginia&#x27;s highest peaks including Whitetop Mountain and Mount Rogers , the highest point in the Commonwealth.

Chief summits in the southern section of the Blue Ridge are located along two main crests, the Western or Unaka Front along the Tennessee-North Carolina border and the Eastern Front in North Carolina, or one of several &quot;cross ridges&quot; between the two main crests. Major subranges of the Eastern Front include the Black Mountains, Great Craggy Mountains, and Great Balsam Mountains, and its chief summits include Grandfather Mountain near the Tennessee-North Carolina border, Mount Mitchell in the Blacks, and Black Balsam Knob and Cold Mountain in the Great Balsams. The Western Blue Ridge Front is subdivided into the Unaka Range, the Bald Mountains, the Great Smoky Mountains, and the Unicoi Mountains, and its major peaks include Roan Mountain in the Unakas, Big Bald and Max Patch in the Bald Mountains, Kuwohi , Mount Le Conte , and Mount Guyot in the Great Smokies, and Big Frog Mountain near the Tennessee-Georgia-North Carolina border. Prominent summits in the cross ridges include Waterrock Knob () in the Plott Balsams. Across northern Georgia, numerous peaks exceed , including Brasstown Bald, the state&#x27;s highest, at Rabun Bald. In north-central Alabama, Mount Cheaha rises prominently to over its surroundings, as part of the southernmost spur of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

=== Categorization of Appalachian mountains before physiographic regions ===
Sources written prior to the recognition of the concept of physiographic regions divided the Appalachian Mountains into three major sections:

* Northern: The northern section runs from the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador to the Hudson River. It includes the Long Range Mountains and Annieopsquotch Mountains on the island of Newfoundland, the French Territorial Collectivity of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon southwest of Newfoundland, Chic-Choc Mountains and Notre Dame Range in Quebec and New Brunswick, scattered elevations and small ranges elsewhere in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, the Longfellow Mountains in Maine, the White Mountains in New Hampshire, the Green Mountains in Vermont, and The Berkshires in Massachusetts, and Connecticut, the Metacomet Ridge Mountains in Connecticut and south-central Massachusetts, and the Adirondack Mountains in New York are all part of the Appalachian Mountains as defined by the governments of Canada and the United States.Mountains of the Long Range in Newfoundland, such as the Cabox and Gros Morne, reach heights of nearly . In the Chic-Choc and Notre Dame Mountain ranges in Quebec, the higher summits rise above in elevation. Isolated peaks and small ranges in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick vary from . In Maine, several peaks exceed , including Mount Katahdin at . In New Hampshire, many summits rise above , including Mount Washington in the White Mountains at , Adams at , Jefferson at , Monroe at , Madison at , Lafayette at , and Lincoln at . In the Green Mountains the highest point, Mt. Mansfield, is in elevation; others include Killington Peak at , Camel&#x27;s Hump at , Mt. Abraham at , and a number of other heights exceeding .
* Central: The central section runs from the Hudson Valley in New York to the New River through the Lehigh Valley and central Pennsylvania and western Maryland to western Virginia and West Virginia. The central region comprises the Valley Ridges between the Allegheny Front of the Allegheny Plateau and the Great Appalachian Valley, the New York–New Jersey Highlands, the Taconic Mountains in New York, and a large portion of the Blue Ridge. In addition to the true folded mountains, known as the ridge and valley province, the area of dissected plateau to the north and west of the mountains is usually grouped with the Appalachians. This includes the Catskill Mountains of Lower New York, the Poconos in Pennsylvania, and the Allegheny Plateau of New York&#x27;s Southern Tier region, western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and northern West Virginia.
* Southern: The southern section runs from the New River and consists of the prolongation of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which is divided into the Western Blue Ridge (or Unaka) Front and the Eastern Blue Ridge Front, the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, and the Cumberland Plateau. This same plateau is known as the Cumberland Plateau in southern West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, far Southwest Virginia, eastern Tennessee, and northern Alabama.

==Geology==

Plate tectonics over the period dating back at least 1 billion years led to geological creation of the land that is now the Appalachian Mountain range. The continental movement led to collisions that built mountains and they later pulled apart creating oceans over parts of the continent that are now exposed.

===Grenville Orogeny and formation of Supercontinent Rodinia===
The first mountain-building tectonic plate collision that initiated the construction of what are today the Appalachians occurred at least a billion years ago when the pre-North American craton called Laurentia collided with at least one other craton - Amazonia. All the other cratons of the earth also collided at about this time to form the supercontinent Rodinia and were surrounded by one single ocean. (It is possible that the cratons of Kalahari, and Rio Plato, were also part of that early collision since they were present as Rodinia broke up). Mountain-building referred to as the Grenville Orogeny occurred along the boundaries of the cratons. The present Appalachian Mountains have at least two areas which are made from rock formations that were formed during this orogeny - the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Adirondacks.
===Breakup of Rodinia and formation of the Iapetus Ocean===
After the Grenville orogeny, the direction of the continental drift reversed, and the single supercontinent Rodinia began to break up. The mountains formed during the Grenvillian era underwent erosion due to weathering, glaciation, and other natural processes, resulting in the leveling of the landscape. The eroded sediments from these mountains contributed to the formation of sedimentary basins and valleys. For example, in what is now the southern United States, the Ococee Basin was formed. Seawater filled the basin. Rivers from the surrounding countryside carried clay, silt, sand, and gravel to the basin, much as rivers today carry sediment from the midcontinent region to the Gulf of Mexico. The sediment spread out in layers on the basin floor. The basin continued to subside, and over a long period of time, probably millions of years, a great thickness of sediment accumulated. Eventually, the tectonic forces pulling the two continents apart became so strong that an ocean formed off the eastern coast of the Laurentian margin. This was called the Iapetus Ocean and was the precursor of the modern Atlantic Ocean. The rocks of the Valley and Ridge province formed over millions of years, in the Iapetus. Shells and other hard parts of ancient marine plants and animals accumulated to form limey deposits that later became limestone. This is the same process by which limestone forms in modern oceans. The weathering of limestone, now exposed at the land surface, produces the lime-rich soils that are so prevalent in the fertile farmland of the Valley and Ridge province.

During this continental break-up, around 600 million to 560 million years ago, volcanic activity was present along the tectonic margins. There is evidence of this activity in today&#x27;s Blue Ridge Mountains. Mount Rogers, Whitetop Mountain, and Pine Mountain are all the result of volcanic activity that occurred around this time. Evidence of subsurface activity, dikes and sills intruding into the overlying rock, is present in the Blue Ridge as well. For instance, mafic rocks have been found along the Fries Fault in the central Blue Ridge area of Montgomery County, VA.

===Taconic Orogeny===

The Iapetus continued to expand and during that time bacteria, algae, and many species of invertebrates flourished in the oceans, but there were no plants or animals on land. Then, during the middle Ordovician Period about 500 to 470 million years ago, the motion of the crustal plates changed, and the continents began to move back toward each other. The once-quiet Appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring Iapetus oceanic plate containing a volcanic arc collided with and began sinking beneath the North American craton. Volcanoes grew along the continental margin coincident with the initiation of subduction. Thrust faulting uplifted and warped older sedimentary rock laid down on the passive margin. As the mountains rose, erosion began to wear them down over time. Streams carried rock debris downslope to be deposited in nearby lowlands. The Taconic orogeny ended after about 60 million years, but built much of the land mass that is now New England and southwestward to Pennsylvania.

The Taconic Orogeny was the second of four mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the Appalachians, culminating in the collision of North America and Africa (see Alleghanian orogeny).

===Acadian Orogeny===
The third mountain-building event was the Acadian orogeny which occurred between 375 and 359 million years ago. The Acadian orogeny was caused by a series of collisions of pieces of crust from the Avalonia Terrane, sections broken off from continent of Gondwana, with the North American Plate. The collision initiating this orogeny resulted in the closing of the southern Iapetus Ocean and the formation of a high mountain belt. After the Acadian collision took place, Gondwana began to retreat from Laurentia with the newly accreted Avalonian terranes left behind. As Gondwana moved away, a new ocean opened up, the Rheic Ocean, during the Middle to Late Devonian, and subsequently its closure would result in the formation of the Alleghanian orogeny.

===Alleghenian Orogeny and Supercontinent Pangea===
As the continental plates moved closer together, fragments of oceanic crust, islands, and other continental masses collided with the eastern margin of ancestral North America. By this time, plants had appeared on land, followed by scorpions, insects, and amphibians. The ocean continued to shrink until, about 270 million years ago, the continents that were ancestral to North America and Africa collided during the formation of the supercontinent Pangea.

Because North America and Africa were once geographically connected, the Appalachians formed part of the same mountain chain as the Little Atlas in Morocco. This mountain range, known as the Central Pangean Mountains, extended into Scotland, before the Mesozoic Era opening of the Iapetus Ocean, from the North America/Europe collision (See Caledonian orogeny).

By the end of the Mesozoic Era, the Appalachian Mountains had been eroded to an almost flat plain. It was not until the region was uplifted during the Cenozoic Era that the distinctive topography of the present formed. Uplift rejuvenated the streams, which rapidly responded by cutting downward into the ancient bedrock. Some streams flowed along weak layers that define the folds and faults created many millions of years earlier. Other streams downcut so rapidly that they cut right across the resistant folded rocks of the mountain core, carving canyons across rock layers and geologic structures.

===Mineral resources===

The Appalachian Mountains contain major deposits of anthracite coal as well as bituminous coal. In the folded mountains the coal is in metamorphosed form as anthracite, represented by the Coal Region of northeastern Pennsylvania. The bituminous coal fields of western Pennsylvania, western Maryland, southeastern Ohio, eastern Kentucky, southwestern Virginia, and West Virginia contain the sedimentary form of coal. The mountain top removal method of coal mining, in which entire mountain tops are removed, is currently threatening vast areas and ecosystems of the Appalachian Mountain region. The surface coal mining that started in the 1940s has significantly impacted the central Appalachian Mountains in Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. Early mining methods were unregulated and mined land reclamation research, including acid base reaction, was led by the West Virginia University in the 1960s and 1970s. West Virginia developed rigorous mine reclamation standards for state coal mines in the late 1960s. Regulations were introduced by most states to protect the Appalachian Mountains by the late 1960s. Social and political activism brought about the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.

The 1859 discovery of commercial quantities of petroleum in the Appalachian Mountains of western Pennsylvania started the modern United States petroleum industry. Recent discoveries of commercial natural gas deposits in the Marcellus Shale formation and Utica Shale formations have once again focused oil industry attention on the Appalachian Basin.

Some plateaus of the Appalachian Mountains contain metallic minerals such as iron and zinc.

===Drainage===

There are many geological issues concerning the rivers and streams of the Appalachians. In spite of the existence of the Great Appalachian Valley, many of the main rivers are transverse to the mountain system axis. The drainage divide of the Appalachians follows a tortuous course that crosses the mountainous belt just north of the New River in Virginia. South of the New River, rivers head into the Blue Ridge, cross the higher Unakas, receive important tributaries from the Great Valley, and traversing the Cumberland Plateau in spreading gorges (water gaps), escape by way of the Cumberland River and the Tennessee River rivers to the Ohio River and the Mississippi River, and thence to the Gulf of Mexico. In the central section, north of the New River, the rivers, rising in or just beyond the Valley Ridges, flow through great gorges to the Great Valley, and then across the Blue Ridge to tidal estuaries penetrating the coastal plain via the Roanoke River, James River, Potomac River, and Susquehanna River.

In the northern section the height of land lies on the inland side of the mountainous belt, and thus the main lines of drainage run from north to south, exemplified by the Hudson River. However, the valley through which the Hudson River flows was cut by the gigantic glaciers of the ice ages—the same glaciers that deposited their terminal moraines in southern New York and formed the east–west Long Island.

The Appalachian region is generally considered the geographical divide between the eastern seaboard of the United States and the Midwest region of the country. The Eastern Continental Divide follows the Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania to Georgia.

==Ecology==
The Appalachians, particularly the Central and Southern regions, is one of the most biodiverse places in North America. The north–south orientation of the long ridges and valleys contributes to the high number of plant and animal species. Species were able to migrate through these from either direction during alternating periods of warming and cooling, settling in the microclimates that best suited them.

===Flora===



The flora of the Appalachians are diverse and vary primarily in response to geology, latitude, elevation and moisture availability. Geobotanically, they constitute a floristic province of the North American Atlantic Region. The Appalachians consist primarily of deciduous broad-leaf trees and evergreen needle-leaf conifers, but also contain the evergreen broad-leaf American holly (&quot;Ilex opaca&quot;), and the deciduous needle-leaf conifer, the tamarack, or eastern larch (&quot;Larix laricina&quot;).

The dominant northern and high elevation conifer is the red spruce (&quot;Picea rubens&quot;), which grows from near sea level to above above sea level (asl) in northern New England and southeastern Canada. It also grows southward along the Appalachian crest to the highest elevations of the southern Appalachians, as in North Carolina and Tennessee. In the central Appalachians it is usually confined above asl, except for a few cold valleys in which it reaches lower elevations. In the southern Appalachians, it is restricted to higher elevations. Another species is the black spruce (&quot;Picea mariana&quot;), which extends farthest north of any conifer in North America, is found at high elevations in the northern Appalachians, and in bogs as far south as Pennsylvania.

The Appalachians are also home to two species of fir, the boreal balsam fir (&quot;Abies balsamea&quot;), and the southern high elevation endemic, Fraser fir (&quot;Abies fraseri&quot;). Fraser fir is endemic to the highest parts of the southern Appalachian Mountains, where along with red spruce it forms a fragile ecosystem known as the Southern Appalachian spruce–fir forest. Fraser fir rarely occurs below , and becomes the dominant tree type at . By contrast, balsam fir is found from near sea level to the tree line in the northern Appalachians, but ranges only as far south as Virginia and West Virginia in the central Appalachians, where it is usually confined above asl, except in cold valleys. Curiously, it is associated with oaks in Virginia. The balsam fir of Virginia and West Virginia is thought by some to be a natural hybrid between the more northern variety and Fraser fir. While red spruce is common in both upland and bog habitats, balsam fir, as well as black spruce and tamarack, are more characteristic of the latter. However, balsam fir also does well in soils with a pH as high as 6.

Eastern or Canada hemlock (&quot;Tsuga canadensis&quot;) is another important evergreen needle-leaf conifer that grows along the Appalachian chain from north to south but is confined to lower elevations than red spruce and the firs. It generally occupies richer and less acidic soils than the spruce and firs and is characteristic of deep, shaded and moist mountain valleys and coves. It is subject to the hemlock woolly adelgid (&quot;Adelges tsugae&quot;), an introduced insect, that is rapidly extirpating it as a forest tree. Less abundant, and restricted to the southern Appalachians, is Carolina hemlock (&quot;Tsuga caroliniana&quot;). Like Canada hemlock, this tree suffers severely from the hemlock woolly adelgid.

Several species of pines characteristic of the Appalachians are eastern white pine (&quot;Pinus strobus &quot;), Virginia pine (&quot;Pinus virginiana&quot;), pitch pine (&quot;Pinus rigida &quot;), Table Mountain pine (&quot;Pinus pungens&quot;) and shortleaf pine (&quot;Pinus echinata&quot;). Red pine (&quot;Pinus resinosa&quot;) is a boreal species that forms a few high elevation outliers as far south as West Virginia. All of these species except white pine tend to occupy sandy, rocky, poor soil sites, which are mostly acidic in character. White pine, a large species valued for its timber, tends to do best in rich, moist soil, either acidic or alkaline in character. Pitch pine is also at home in acidic, boggy soil, and Table Mountain pine may occasionally be found in this habitat as well. Shortleaf pine is generally found in warmer habitats and at lower elevations than the other species. All the species listed do best in open or lightly shaded habitats, although white pine also thrives in shady coves, valleys, and on floodplains.

The Appalachians are characterized by a wealth of large, beautiful deciduous broadleaf (hardwood) trees. Their occurrences are best summarized and described in E. Lucy Braun&#x27;s 1950 classic, &quot;Deciduous Forests of Eastern North America&quot; (Macmillan, New York). The most diverse and richest forests are the mixed-mesophytic or medium-moisture types, which are largely confined to rich, moist montane soils of the southern and central Appalachians, particularly in the Cumberland and Allegheny Mountains, but also thrive in the southern Appalachian coves. Characteristic canopy species are white basswood (&quot;Tilia heterophylla&quot;), yellow buckeye (&quot;Aesculus octandra&quot;), sugar maple (&quot;Acer saccharum&quot;), American beech (&quot;Fagus grandifolia&quot;), tuliptree (&quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot;), white ash (&quot;Fraxinus americana&quot;) and yellow birch (&quot;Betula alleganiensis&quot;). Other common trees are red maple (&quot;Acer rubrum&quot;), shagbark and bitternut hickories (&quot;Carya ovata&quot; and &quot;C. cordiformis&quot;) and black or sweet birch (&quot;Betula lenta &quot;). Small understory trees and shrubs include paw paw (&quot;Asimina tribola&quot;), flowering dogwood (&quot;Cornus florida&quot;), hophornbeam (&quot;Ostrya virginiana&quot;), witch-hazel (&quot;Hamamelis virginiana&quot;) and spicebush (&quot;Lindera benzoin&quot;). There are also hundreds of perennial and annual herbs, among them such herbal and medicinal plants as American ginseng (&quot;Panax quinquefolius&quot;), goldenseal (&quot;Hydrastis canadensis&quot;), bloodroot (&quot;Sanguinaria canadensis&quot;) and black cohosh (&quot;Cimicifuga racemosa&quot;).

The foregoing trees, shrubs, and herbs are also more widely distributed in less rich mesic forests that generally occupy coves, stream valleys and flood plains throughout the southern and central Appalachians at low and intermediate elevations. In the northern Appalachians and at higher elevations of the central and southern Appalachians these diverse mesic forests give way to less diverse northern hardwood forests with canopies dominated only by American beech, sugar maple, American basswood (&quot;Tilia americana&quot;) and yellow birch and with far fewer species of shrubs and herbs.

Drier and rockier uplands and ridges are occupied by oak–chestnut forests dominated by a variety of oaks (&quot;Quercus&quot; spp.), hickories (&quot;Carya&quot; spp.) and, in the past, by the American chestnut (&quot;Castanea dentata&quot;). The American chestnut was virtually eliminated as a canopy species by the introduced fungal chestnut blight (&quot;Cryphonectaria parasitica&quot;), but lives on as sapling-sized sprouts that originate from roots, which are not killed by the fungus. In present-day forest canopies, chestnut has been largely replaced by oaks.

The oak forests of the southern and central Appalachians consist largely of black, northern red, white, chestnut and scarlet oaks (&quot;Quercus velutina&quot;, &quot;Q. rubra&quot;, &quot;Q. alba&quot;, &quot;Q. prinus&quot; and &quot;Q. coccinea&quot;) and hickories, such as the pignut (&quot;Carya glabra&quot;) in particular. The richest forests, which grade into mesic types, usually in coves and on gentle slopes, have predominantly white and northern red oaks, while the driest sites are dominated by chestnut oak, or sometimes by scarlet or northern red oaks. In the northern Appalachians the oaks, except for white and northern red, drop out, while the latter extends farthest north.

The oak forests generally lack the diverse small tree, shrub and herb layers of mesic forests. Shrubs are generally ericaceous, and include the evergreen mountain laurel (&quot;Kalmia latifolia&quot;), various species of blueberries (&quot;Vaccinium&quot; spp.), black huckleberry (&quot;Gaylussacia baccata&quot;), a number of deciduous rhododendrons (azaleas), and smaller heaths such as teaberry (&quot;Gaultheria procumbens&quot;) and trailing arbutus (&quot;Epigaea repens &quot;). The evergreen great rhododendron (&quot;Rhododendron maximum&quot;) is characteristic of moist stream valleys. These occurrences are in line with the prevailing acidic character of most oak forest soils. In contrast, the much rarer chinquapin oak (&quot;Quercus muehlenbergii&quot;) demands alkaline soils and generally grows where limestone rock is near the surface. Hence no ericaceous shrubs are associated with it.

The Appalachian flora also include a diverse assemblage of bryophytes (mosses and liverworts), as well as fungi. Some species are rare and/or endemic. As with vascular plants, these tend to be closely related to the character of the soils and the thermal environment in which they are found.

Eastern deciduous forests are subject to a number of serious insect and disease outbreaks. Among the most conspicuous is that of the introduced spongy moth (&quot;Lymantria dispar&quot;), which infests primarily oaks, causing severe defoliation and tree mortality. But it also has the benefit of eliminating weak individuals, and thus improving the genetic stock, as well as creating rich habitat of a type through accumulation of dead wood. Because hardwoods sprout so readily, this moth is not as harmful as the hemlock woolly adelgid. Perhaps more serious is the introduced beech bark disease complex, which includes both a scale insect (&quot;Cryptococcus fagisuga&quot;) and fungal components.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Appalachian forests were subject to severe and destructive logging and land clearing, which resulted in the designation of the national forests and parks as well many state-protected areas. However, these and a variety of other destructive activities continue, albeit in diminished forms; and thus far only a few ecologically based management practices have taken hold.

Appalachian bogs are boreal ecosystems, which occur in many places in the Appalachians, particularly the Allegheny and Blue Ridge subranges. Though popularly called bogs, many of them are technically fens.

Several mountain summits in the southern Appalachians are covered with expansive open habitats (either grassy meadows or heath) known as Appalachian balds. These habitats support many unique plant and animal communities, including rare, relict species, that are adapted to the open, exposed habitat. Their origins are heavily debated; while all were formerly thought to have anthropogenic origins, more recent evidence indicates a mixed origin: many were formed by climatic conditions in the Pleistocene and kept open by Pleistocene megafauna, then by other grazing wildlife (such as bison, elk, and deer) and Native American burning practices, and finally by grazing livestock introduced by European settlers. Others, especially those dominated by introduced grasses, may be fully anthropogenic in origin. The abandonment of grazing has caused trees to encroach on many of these balds, threatening their ecosystems.
In contrast to the largely grazing-influenced balds of the southern Appalachians, parts of the northern Appalachians such as the White Mountains. the Adirondack Mountains, and Mount Katahdin have summits covered with true alpine tundra; these ecosystems are kept clear due to extremely harsh winter storms, and support a vegetation community more akin to that of the Arctic Circle.

===Fauna===
Animals that characterize the Appalachian forests include five species of tree squirrels. The most commonly seen is the low to moderate elevation eastern gray squirrel (&quot;Sciurus carolinensis&quot;). Occupying similar habitat is the slightly larger fox squirrel (&quot;Sciurus niger&quot;) and the much smaller southern flying squirrel (&quot;Glaucomys volans&quot;). More characteristic of cooler northern and high elevation habitat is the red squirrel (&quot;Tamiasciurus hudsonicus&quot;), whereas the Appalachian northern flying squirrel (&quot;Glaucomys sabrinus fuscus&quot;), which closely resembles the southern flying squirrel, is confined to northern hardwood and spruce–fir forests.

As familiar as squirrels are the eastern cottontail rabbit (&quot;Silvilagus floridanus&quot;) and the white-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;). The latter in particular has greatly increased in abundance as a result of the extirpation of the eastern wolf (&quot;Canis lupus lycaon&quot;) and the North American cougar. This has led to the overgrazing and browsing of many plants of the Appalachian forests, as well as destruction of agricultural crops. Other deer include the moose (&quot;Alces alces &quot;), found only in the north, and the elk (&quot;Cervus canadensis&quot;), which, although once extirpated, is now making a comeback, through transplantation, in the southern and central Appalachians. In Quebec, the Chic-Chocs host the only population of reindeer (&quot;Rangifer tarandus&quot;) south of the St. Lawrence River. An additional species that is common in the north but extends its range southward at high elevations to Virginia and West Virginia is the varying or snowshoe hare (&quot;Lepus americanus&quot;). However, these central Appalachian populations are scattered and very small.

Another species of great interest is the beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;), which is showing a great resurgence in numbers after its near extirpation for its pelt. This resurgence is bringing about a drastic alteration in habitat through the construction of dams and other structures throughout the mountains.

Other common forest animals are the black bear (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;), striped skunk (&quot;Mephitis mephitis&quot;), raccoon (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;), opossum (&quot;Didelphis virginianus&quot;), woodchuck (&quot;Marmota monax&quot;), bobcat (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;), gray fox (&quot;Urocyon cinereoargenteus&quot;), red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) and in recent years, the coyote (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), another species favored by the advent of Europeans and the extirpation of eastern and red wolves (&quot;Canis rufus&quot;). European boars (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;) were introduced in the early 20th century.

Characteristic birds of the forest are wild turkey (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo silvestris&quot;), ruffed grouse (&quot;Bonasa umbellus&quot;), mourning dove (&quot;Zenaida macroura&quot;), common raven (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;), wood duck (&quot;Aix sponsa&quot;), great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;), barred owl (&quot;Strix varia&quot;), screech owl (&quot;Megascops asio&quot;), red-tailed hawk (&quot;Buteo jamaicensis&quot;), red-shouldered hawk (&quot;Buteo lineatus&quot;), and northern goshawk, as well as a great variety of &quot;songbirds&quot; (Passeriformes), like the warblers in particular.

Of great importance are the many species of salamanders and, in particular, the lungless species (family Plethodontidae) that live in great abundance concealed by leaves and debris, on the forest floor. Most frequently seen, however, is the eastern or red-spotted newt (&quot;Notophthalmus viridescens&quot;), whose terrestrial eft form is often encountered on the open, dry forest floor. It has been estimated that salamanders represent the largest class of animal biomass in the Appalachian forests. Frogs and toads are of lesser diversity and abundance, but the wood frog (&quot;Rana sylvatica&quot;) is, like the eft, commonly encountered on the dry forest floor, while a number of species of small frogs, such as spring peepers (&quot;Pseudacris crucifer&quot;), enliven the forest with their calls. Salamanders and other amphibians contribute greatly to nutrient cycling through their consumption of small life forms on the forest floor and in aquatic habitats.

Although reptiles are less abundant and diverse than amphibians, a number of snakes are conspicuous members of the fauna. One of the largest is the non-venomous black rat snake (&quot;Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta&quot;), while the common garter snake (&quot;Thamnophis sirtalis&quot;) is among the smallest but most abundant. The eastern copperhead (&quot;Agkistrodon contortrix&quot;) and the timber rattler (&quot;Crotalus horridus&quot;) are venomous pit vipers. There are few lizards, but the broad-headed skink (&quot;Eumeces laticeps&quot;), at up to in length, and an excellent climber and swimmer, is one of the largest and most spectacular in appearance and action. The most common turtle is the eastern box turtle (&quot;Terrapene carolina carolina&quot;), which is found in both upland and lowland forests in the central and southern Appalachians. Prominent among aquatic species is the large common snapping turtle (&quot;Chelydra serpentina&quot;), which occurs throughout the Appalachians.

Appalachian streams are notable for their highly diverse freshwater fish life. Among the most abundant and diverse are those of the minnow family (family Cyprinidae), while species of the colorful darters (&quot;Percina&quot; spp.) are also abundant.

A characteristic fish of shaded, cool Appalachian forest streams is the wild brook or speckled trout (&quot;Salvelinus fontinalis&quot;), which is much sought after as a game fish.

==Impact on North American history==

===Indigenous people===
The roots of the Appalachian regions&#x27; histories trace back to the indigenous peoples who inhabited these lands long before European arrival. Indigenous communities across the Appalachians developed diverse cultures, languages, and societies, adapting to the region&#x27;s varying environments and ecosystems. The interactions between indigenous communities and the natural world laid the foundation for the intricate relationship between humans and the Appalachian landscape. Indigenous peoples thrived in these challenging terrains, adapting their lifestyles to the resources available. They forged deep connections with the land, developing sustainable practices for hunting, fishing, agriculture, and gathering. The Appalachian landscape provided a rich tapestry of flora and fauna, which indigenous communities learned to harness for their sustenance and well-being. The Appalachian Mountains served as a conduit for trade networks, connecting distant indigenous communities through intricate trails. These trade routes facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultural practices across vast distances. This network fostered a sense of shared identity among diverse indigenous groups, transcending geographical boundaries.

===European exploration===
During the late 15th and early 16th centuries, European explorers embarked on voyages of discovery across the Atlantic Ocean. While seeking new trade routes and riches, they encountered the vast landmass of North America, including the Appalachian regions. The mountains posed a formidable geographical obstacle that European explorers had to navigate. The French, British, and Spanish were among the major powers vying for dominance in the New World, and their interactions with indigenous communities and the Appalachian landscape shaped the course of history.

====Colonial settlements====
The Appalachian Highlands and Lowlands became focal points for European colonial expansion. French and British explorers traversed the Appalachian Mountains as they established footholds in North America. The French established settlements in the Great Lakes region and Canada, while the British colonies stretched along the eastern seaboard of what would become the United States. The territorial ambitions of European powers set the stage for later conflicts such as the French and Indian War.

The British Proclamation of 1763 holds significance in both Canadian and American histories. In the United States, the proclamation aimed to curb westward expansion beyond the Appalachian Mountains to avoid conflicts with indigenous nations, leading to tensions between American colonists and the British Crown and contributing to the drive for independence. In Canada, the proclamation provided a framework for governing newly acquired French territories, including Quebec, to ensure stability and control over the region. The ramifications of the proclamation were multifaceted, reflecting the complex dynamics of colonial governance and indigenous relations.

====Cultural exchange and identity====

The Appalachian Mountains in both countries nurtured unique cultural identities that persist to this day. The isolation of these mountainous regions allowed for the development of distinctive music, folklore, and traditions. Appalachian music played a significant role in the broader evolution of American and Canadian music genres. While each side of the border has its own cultural expressions, the shared geographical features and historical interactions contributed to common threads of self-reliance, resilience, and connection to nature that characterize Appalachian culture.

====Colonization and frontier expansion====
European exploration of the Appalachian regions contributed to the mapping and understanding of the area&#x27;s geographical features. Explorers documented the rugged terrain, dense forests, and abundant natural resources. Their observations shaped the perceptions of the Appalachian landscape and influenced subsequent settlement patterns and resource utilization. The range posed significant barriers to westward expansion, leaving an indelible mark on colonization efforts.

====Cumberland Gap and Gaspé Peninsula====

The Cumberland Gap, a prominent geographic feature, played a pivotal role in westward expansion in the United States. This passage through the Appalachian Mountains provided a route for pioneers seeking new opportunities beyond the mountains. Similarly, Canada had its own geographical passage, the Gaspé Peninsula, which facilitated exploration and trade in the Canadian Appalachian region. These passages were vital gateways that shaped the movement of people, ideas, and resources on both sides of the border.

<doc id="85024" wikidata="Q208074" url="?curid=85024" title="Network layer">
<text>In the seven-layer OSI model of computer networking, the network layer is layer 3. The network layer is responsible for packet forwarding including routing through intermediate routers.

==Functions==
The network layer provides the means of transferring variable-length network packets from a source to a destination host via one or more networks. Within the service layering semantics of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) network architecture, the network layer responds to service requests from the transport layer and issues service requests to the data link layer.

Functions of the network layer include:
; Connectionless communication
: For example, Internet Protocol is connectionless, in that a data packet can travel from a sender to a recipient without the recipient having to send an acknowledgement. Connection-oriented protocols exist at other, higher layers of the OSI model.
; Host addressing
:Every host in the network must have a unique address that determines where it is. This address is normally assigned from a hierarchical system. For example, you can be:
:&quot;Fred Murphy&quot; to people in your house, 
:&quot;Fred Murphy, 1 Main Street&quot; to Dubliners,
:&quot;Fred Murphy, 1 Main Street, Dublin&quot; to people in Ireland, 
:&quot;Fred Murphy, 1 Main Street, Dublin, Ireland&quot; to people anywhere in the world. 
:On the Internet, addresses are known as IP addresses (Internet Protocol).
; Message forwarding
:Since many networks are partitioned into subnetworks and connect to other networks for wide-area communications, networks use specialized hosts, called gateways or routers, to forward packets between networks.

==Relation to TCP/IP model==
The TCP/IP model describes the protocols used by the Internet. The TCP/IP model has a layer called the Internet layer, located above the link layer. In many textbooks and other secondary references, the TCP/IP Internet layer is equated with the OSI network layer. However, this comparison is misleading, as the allowed characteristics of protocols (e.g., whether they are connection-oriented or connection-less) placed into these layers are different in the two models. The TCP/IP Internet layer is in fact only a subset of functionality of the network layer. It describes only one type of network architecture, the Internet.

==Fragmentation of Internet Protocol packets==
The network layer is responsible for fragmentation and reassembly for IPv4 packets that are larger than the smallest MTU of all the intermediate links on the packet&#x27;s path to its destination. It is the function of routers to fragment packets if needed, and of hosts to reassemble them if received.

Conversely, IPv6 packets are not fragmented during forwarding, but the MTU supported by a specific path must still be established, to avoid packet loss. For this, Path MTU discovery is used between endpoints, which makes it part of the Transport layer, instead of this layer.

==Protocols==
The following are examples of protocols operating at the network layer.

* CLNS, Connectionless-mode Network Service
* DDP, Datagram Delivery Protocol
* EGP, Exterior Gateway Protocol
* EIGRP, Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
* ICMP, Internet Control Message Protocol
* IGMP, Internet Group Management Protocol
* IPsec, Internet Protocol Security
* IPv4/IPv6, Internet Protocol
* IPX, Internetwork Packet Exchange
* LLARP, Low Latency Anonymous Routing Protocol 
* OSPF, Open Shortest Path First
* PIM, Protocol Independent Multicast
* RIP, Routing Information Protocol

<doc id="85025" wikidata="Q889656" url="?curid=85025" title="Amulius">
<text>In Roman mythology, Amulius () was king of Alba Longa who ordered the death of his infant, twin grandnephews Romulus, the eventual founder and king of Rome, and Remus. He was deposed and killed by them after they survived and grew to adulthood.

He is the brother and usurper of Numitor and son of Procas. He was said to have reigned 41 years before his death (793-752 BC). His brother had been king, but Amulius overthrew him, killed his son, and took the throne. He forced Rhea Silvia, Numitor&#x27;s daughter, to become a Vestal Virgin, a priestess of Vesta, so that she would never bear any sons that might overthrow him. However, she was raped or seduced by the god Mars, resulting in the birth of the twins. Rhea was thrown into prison and her sons ordered to be thrown into the river Tiber. The twins washed up onto dry land and were found by a she-wolf who suckled them. Later their mother was saved by the river god Tiberinus who ended up marrying her. Romulus and Remus went on to found Rome and overthrow Amulius, reinstating their grandfather Numitor as king of Alba Longa.

==Dionysius of Halicarnassus==
Dionysius was a Greek historian and librarian who wrote in the first century BC. He writes that Amulius&#x27; father, King Proca, willed the throne to Numitor but Amulius deposed him. For fear of a threat to his rule, the king had Numitor&#x27;s son, Aegestus killed, blaming thieves. The truth about the crime was known by some, including Numitor, who feigned ignorance. Amulius then appointed Numitor&#x27;s daughter, Rhea Silvia, to the Vestal priestesshood, where her vow of chastity would prevent her from producing any further children. Despite this, she became pregnant a few years later, claiming to have been raped.

In one of the sources, Amulius himself (in full armor to conceal his identity) commits the rape. Rhea Silvia hid her pregnancy with claims of illness so as to avoid her vestal duties. But Amulius was suspicious and employed physicians and his own wife to monitor her for signs of being with child. When he discovered the truth, he placed her under armed guard. After being informed of the delivery of Romulus and Remus, Amulius suspected that she had in fact given birth to triplets, the third child having been concealed from the guards present. Rhea Silvia was either put to death, or kept secretly in a hidden dungeon for the rest of her life.

Citing Fabius Pictor, Cincius, Cato, and Piso, Dionysius writes that the king ordered the twins to be tossed into the Tiber. When his servants arrived at the riverbank, high waters had made it impossible to reach the stream. So they left the twin&#x27;s basket in a pool of standing water on the site of the ficus Ruminalis. After the waters of the Tiber had carried the twins away, their basket was overturned by a rock and they were dumped into the mud. It was there, that a she-wolf famously found them and nursed them in front of her lair (the Lupercal). Amulius&#x27; servant Faustulus happened upon the scene. He took the boys home and brought them up with his wife. Later, quoting Fabius&#x27; account of the overthrow of Amulius, Plutarch claims that Faustulus had saved the basket in which the boys had been abandoned.

According to Fabius, when the twins were 18, they became embroiled in a violent dispute with some of Numitor&#x27;s herdsmen. In retaliation, Remus was lured into an ambush and captured while Romulus was elsewhere. In Aelius Tubero&#x27;s version, the twins were taking part in the festivities of the Lupercalia, requiring them to run naked through the village when Remus, defenseless as he was, was taken prisoner by Numitor&#x27;s armed men.

After rounding up the toughest herdsmen to help him free Remus, Romulus rashly set out for Alba Longa. To avoid tragedy, Faustulus intercepted him and revealed the truth about the twins&#x27; parentage. With the discovery that Numitor was family, Romulus set his sights on Amulius instead. He and the rest of his village set out in small groups toward the city so that their arrival would go unnoticed by the guards. Meanwhile, after Amulius turned Remus over to Numitor to determine his punishment, Remus was told of his origins by the former king and eagerly joined with him in their own effort to topple Amulius. When Romulus joined them, they began to plan their next move.

Faustulus was caught by the Alban guards trying to sneak the infant twins&#x27; basket into the city and was brought before Amulius by the same servant who had taken the boys to the river those many years before. Amulius questions his man and falsely claimed he means the twins no harm. Faustulus, trying to protect Romulus and Remus, and escape the king&#x27;s clutches, claimed he had been bringing the basket to the imprisoned Rhea Silvia at the twins&#x27; request and that they were at the moment tending their flocks in the mountains.

Amulius sent Faustulus and some of his men to find the twins. He then tried to trick Numitor into coming to the palace so that the former king could be kept under guard until the situation had been dealt with. However, when the man he sent to lure Numitor into his clutches arrived at the deposed king&#x27;s house, he betrayed Amulius and revealed everything that had happened at the palace.

The twins and their grandfather led their supporters to the palace, killed Amulius, and took control of the city.

<text>In Roman religion, Angerona or Angeronia was an old Roman goddess, whose name and functions are variously explained. She is sometimes identified with the goddess Feronia.

==Description==
According to ancient authorities, she was a goddess who relieved men from pain and sorrow, or delivered the Romans and their flocks from &quot;angina&quot; (quinsy). Also she was a protecting goddess of Rome and the keeper of the sacred name of the city, which might not be pronounced lest it should be revealed to her enemies. It was even thought that &quot;Angerona&quot; itself was this name.

Modern scholars regard Angerona as a goddess akin to Ops, Acca Larentia, and Dea Dia; or as the goddess of the new year and the returning sun. Her festival, called Divalia or Angeronalia, was celebrated on 21 December. The priests offered sacrifice in the temple of Volupia, the goddess of pleasure, in which stood a statue of Angerona, with a finger on her mouth, which was bound and closed. She was worshiped as Ancharia at Faesulae, where an altar belonging to her was discovered in the late 19th century. In art, she was depicted with a bandaged mouth and a finger pressed to her lips, demanding silence.
Georges Dumézil considers Angerona as the goddess who helps nature and men to sustain successfully the yearly crisis of the winter days. These culminate in the winter solstice, the shortest day, which in Latin is known as &quot;bruma&quot;, from &quot;brevissima (dies)&quot;, the shortest day. The embarrassment, pain and anguish caused by the lack of light and the cold are expressed by the word &quot;angor&quot;. In Latin the cognate word &quot;angustiae&quot; designates a space of time considered as disgracefully and painfully too short.
Angerona and the connected cult guaranteed the overcoming of the unpleasant &quot;angusti dies&quot; narrow, short days.

Dumézil pointed out that the Roman goddesses whose name ends with the suffix &quot;-ona&quot; or &quot;-onia&quot; to discharge the function of helping worshipers to overcome a particular time or condition of crisis: instances include Bellona who allows the Roman to wade across war in the best way possible, Orbona who cares for parents who lost a child, Pellonia who pushes the enemies away, Fessonia who permits travellers to subdue fatigue.

Angerona&#x27;s &quot;feriae&quot; named &quot;Angeronalia&quot; or &quot;Divalia&quot; took place on December 21 – the day of the winter solstice. On that day the pontiffs offered a sacrifice to the goddess &quot;in curia Acculeia&quot; according to Varro or &quot;in sacello Volupiae&quot;, near the &quot;Porta Romanula&quot;, one of the inner gates on the northern side of the Palatine. A famous statue of Angerona, with her mouth bandaged and sealed and with a finger on the lips in the gesture that requests silence, was placed in Angerona&#x27;s shrine, on an altar to Volupia. Dumézil sees in this peculiar feature the reason of her being listed among the goddesses who were considered candidates to the title of secret tutelary deity of Rome.

Dumézil considers this peculiar feature of Angerona&#x27;s statue to hint to a prerogative of the goddess which was well known to the Romans, i.e. her will of requesting silence. He remarks silence in a time of cosmic crisis is a well documented point in other religions, giving two instances from Scandinavian and Vedic religion.

Dumézil (1956) proposes that the association between &quot;Angerona&quot; and &quot;Volupia&quot; can be explained as the pleasure that derives from a fulfilled desire, the achievement of an objective. Thence the description &quot;θεός τῆς βουλῆς καί καιρῶν&quot; [&quot;goddess of advice and of favorable occasions&quot;] given in a Latin-Greek glossary.

<text>Angitia was a goddess among the Marsi, the Paeligni and other Oscan-Umbrian peoples of central Italy. She was associated in antiquity with snake-charmers who claimed her as their ancestor. Roman interpretations probably obscure her Marsian significance.

Angitia&#x27;s myths vary. According to Gnaeus Gellius (late 2nd century BC), Angitia was one of the three daughters of Aeëtes, along with Medea and Circe, two of the most famed sorceresses of Greek myth. Circe, as widely known from the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, practiced transforming spells; Medea ended up in Italy, where her son ruled over the Marsi. Angitia lived in the area around the Fucine lake and specialized in curing snakebites.

Angitia is attested by inscriptions in the territory of the Marsi and elsewhere in the Central Apennines. She is named in three inscriptions from Luco dei Marsi, in antiquity known as &quot;Lucus Angitiae&quot;, &quot;Sacred Grove of Angitia.&quot; The earliest is a dedication to the goddess &quot;on behalf of the Marsic legions,&quot; dating to the late 4th century BC. The name also appears on a dedicatory cippus from Civita d&#x27;Antino, in the Umbrian Iguvine Tablets, and in inscriptions in the territories of the Paeligni, Vestini, and Sabines. She is mentioned along with Angerona in one inscription, and in another her name appears in the plural. Another indicates that she had a temple and a treasury. The Romans derived her name from &quot;anguis&quot;, &quot;serpent,&quot; hence the form &quot;Anguitia&quot;.

As snakes were often associated with the healing arts in antiquity (see, for instance, rod of Asclepius), Angitia is believed to have been mainly a goddess of thaumaturgy. She had powers of witchcraft, magic and medicine being regarded as complementary in the ancient world, and was a master in the art of miraculous and herbal healing, especially when it came to snakebites. She was also attributed with a wide range of powers over snakes, including the power to kill snakes with a touch.

According to the account given by Servius, Angitia was of Greek origin, for Arigitia was the name given by the Marrubians to Medea, who after having left Colchis came to Italy with Jason and taught the people the above-mentioned remedies. Silius Italicus identifies her as Medea.

<text>Chemical synthesis (chemical combination) is the artificial execution of chemical reactions to obtain one or several products. This occurs by physical and chemical manipulations usually involving one or more reactions. In modern laboratory uses, the process is reproducible and reliable.

A chemical synthesis involves one or more compounds (known as &quot;reagents&quot; or &quot;reactants&quot;) that will experience a transformation under certain conditions. Various reaction types can be applied to formulate a desired product. This requires mixing the compounds in a reaction vessel, such as a chemical reactor or a simple round-bottom flask. Many reactions require some form of processing (&quot;work-up&quot;) or purification procedure to isolate the final product.

The amount produced by chemical synthesis is known as the &quot;reaction yield&quot;. Typically, yields are expressed as a mass in grams (in a laboratory setting) or as a percentage of the total theoretical quantity that could be produced based on the limiting reagent. A &quot;side reaction&quot; is an unwanted chemical reaction that can reduce the desired yield. The word &quot;synthesis&quot; was used first in a chemical context by the chemist Hermann Kolbe.

==Strategies==
Chemical synthesis employs various strategies to achieve efficient, precise, and molecular transformations that are more complex than simply converting a reactant A to a reaction product B directly. These strategies can be grouped into approaches for managing reaction sequences.

Reaction Sequences:

Multistep synthesis involves sequential chemical reactions, each requiring its own work-up to isolate intermediates before proceeding to the next stage. For example, the synthesis of paracetamol typically requires three separate reactions. Divergent synthesis starts with a common intermediate, which branches into multiple final products through distinct reaction pathways. Convergent synthesis synthesis involves the combination of multiple intermediates synthesized independently to create a complex final product. One-pot synthesis involves multiple reactions in the same vessel, allowing sequential transformations without intermediate isolation, reducing material loss, time, and the need for additional purification. Cascade reactions, a specific type of one-pot synthesis, streamline the process further by enabling consecutive transformations within a single reactant, minimizing resource consumption

Catalytic Strategies:

Catalysts play a vital role in chemical synthesis by accelerating reactions and enabling specific transformations. Photoredox catalysis provides enhanced control over reaction conditions by regulating the activation of small molecules and the oxidation state of metal catalysts. Biocatalysis uses enzymes as catalysts to speed up chemical reactions with high specificity under mild conditions.

Reactivity Control:

Chemoselectivity ensures that a specific functional group in a molecule reacts while others remain unaffected. Protecting groups temporarily mask reactive sites to enable selective reactions. Kinetic control prioritizes reaction pathways that form products quickly, often yielding less stable compounds. In contrast, thermodynamic control favors the formation of the most stable products.

Advanced Planning and Techniques:

Retrosynthetic analysis is a strategy used to plan complex syntheses by breaking down the target molecule into simpler precursors. Flow chemistry is a continuous reaction method where reactants are pumped through a reactor, allowing precise control over reaction conditions and scalability. This approach has been employed in the large-scale production of pharmaceuticals such as Tamoxifen.

==Organic synthesis==
Organic synthesis is a special type of chemical synthesis dealing with the synthesis of organic compounds. For the total synthesis of a complex product, multiple procedures in sequence may be required to synthesize the product of interest, needing a lot of time. A purely synthetic chemical synthesis begins with basic lab compounds. A semisynthetic process starts with natural products from plants or animals and then modifies them into new compounds.

==Inorganic synthesis==
Inorganic synthesis and organometallic synthesis are used to prepare compounds with significant non-organic content. An illustrative example is the preparation of the anti-cancer drug cisplatin from potassium tetrachloroplatinate.

== Green Chemistry ==
Chemical synthesis using green chemistry promotes the design of new synthetic methods and apparatus that simplify operations and seeks environmentally benign solvents. Key principles include atom economy, which aims to incorporate all reactant atoms into the final product, and the reduction of waste and inefficiencies in chemical processes. Innovations in green chemistry, contribute to more sustainable and efficient chemical synthesis, reducing the environmental and health impacts of traditional methods.


== Applications ==
Chemical synthesis plays a crucial role across various industries, enabling the development of materials, medicines, and technologies with significant real-world impacts.

Catalysis: The development of catalysts is vital for numerous industrial processes, including petroleum refining, petrochemical production, and pollution control. Catalysts synthesized through chemical processes enhance the efficiency and sustainability of these operations.

Medicine: Organic synthesis plays a vital role in drug discovery, allowing chemists to develop and optimize new drugs by modifying organic molecules. Additionally, the synthesis of metal complexes for medical imaging and cancer treatments is a key application of chemical synthesis, enabling advanced diagnostic and therapeutic techniques.

Biopharmaceuticals: Chemical synthesis is critical in the production of biopharmaceuticals, including monoclonal antibodies and other biologics. Chemical synthesis enables the creation and modification of organic and biologically sourced compounds used in these treatments. Advanced techniques, such as DNA recombinant technology and cell fusion, rely on chemical synthesis to produce biologics tailored for specific diseases, ensuring they work effectively and target diseases precisely.

<text>Anna Perenna was an old Roman deity of the circle or &quot;ring&quot; of the year, as indicated by the name (&quot;per annum&quot;).

==Festival==
Anna Perenna&#x27;s festival fell on the Ides of March (March 15), which would have marked the first full moon in the year in the old lunar Roman calendar when March was recognized as the first month of the year, and was held at the goddess&#x27; grove at the first milestone on the Via Flaminia. It was much frequented by the city &quot;plebs&quot;. Macrobius records that offerings were made to her &quot;ut annare perannareque commode liceat&quot;, i.e., &quot;that the circle of the year may be completed happily&quot; and that people sacrificed to her both publicly and privately. Johannes Lydus says that public sacrifice and prayers were offered to her to secure a healthy year. Ovid in his &quot;Fasti&quot; (3.523) provides a vivid description of her outdoor festival:
==Origin==
Ovid reports a legend that identifies Anna Perenna with the sister of Dido, the Carthaginian founder in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. After Dido&#x27;s tragic death, Anna finds refuge from her brother Pygmalion on Malta, with Battus, the king of the island and a wealthy host. Upon protecting Anna for three years, Battus counselled her to flee for her safety and find a fresh place of exile as her brother was seeking war. Forced again to flee over the seas, Anna Perenna was shipwrecked on the coasts of Latium where she was hosted by Aeneas&#x27;s settlement of Lavinium. Anna&#x27;s presence there made Lavinia increasingly jealous. Dido appeared in Anna&#x27;s dream, exhorting her to abandon her latest refuge, from where she was swept away by the river-god Numicus and transformed into a river nymph hidden in the &quot;perennial stream&quot; (&quot;amnis perennis&quot;), and renamed Anna Perenna.

Ovid adds that some equate Anna Perenna with the Moon, with Themis, with Io or with Amaltheia, but prefers the report that during the &quot;secessio plebis&quot; an old woman of Bovillae named Anna baked cakes every morning and brought them to the hungry rebels, in gratitude for which the plebeians worshipped her as a goddess. Ovid goes on to report that after old Anna had become a goddess, she impersonated Minerva to gain admission to the god Mars&#x27; bedchamber, which is why coarse jokes and coarse songs are used at Anna Perenna&#x27;s festivities, and remarks that since the festival of Anna Perenna is in the month dedicated to Mars, it is reasonable that Mars and Anna Perenna should be associated as cult partners.

In the 1930s Franz Altheim, an authority on Roman religion, suggested that Anna Perenna was originally an Etruscan mother goddess, and that her relationship with Aeneas was developed to strengthen her association with Rome.

== Cult==
Two places of worship of Anna Perenna are attested. One in Buscemi, Sicily, where in 1899 some inscriptions to Anna and Apollo were found, and in Rome, where a fountain devoted to Anna Perenna rites was unearthed in 1999.

<text>In ancient Roman religion, Antevorta was a goddess of the future, also known as Porrima or Prorsa (a contracted form of &quot;Proversa&quot;). She and her sister Postverta (or Postvorta) were described as companions or siblings of the goddess Carmenta, sometimes referred to as &quot;the Carmentae&quot;. They may have originally been two aspects of Carmenta, namely those of her knowledge of the future and the past (compare the two-faced Janus).

Antevorta and Postvorta had two altars in Rome and were invoked by pregnant women as protectors against the dangers of childbirth. Antevorta was said to be present at the birth when the baby was born head-first; Postverta, when the feet of the baby came first.

==Star name==
Antevorta is an alternative star name for Gamma Virginis, officially named Porrima.

<doc id="85036" wikidata="Q12706" url="?curid=85036" title="Maxim Gorky">
<text>Alexei Maximovich Peshkov (;  – 18 June 1936), popularly known as Maxim Gorky (; ), was a Russian and Soviet writer and proponent of socialism. He was nominated five times for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Before his success as an author, he travelled widely across the Russian Empire changing jobs frequently, experiences which would later influence his writing.

Gorky&#x27;s most famous works are his early short stories &quot;Chelkash&quot;, &quot;Old Izergil&quot;, and &quot;Twenty-six Men and a Girl&quot; (written in the 1890s); plays &quot;The Philistines&quot; (1901), &quot;The Lower Depths&quot; (1902) and &quot;Children of the Sun&quot; (1905); a poem, &quot;The Song of the Stormy Petrel&quot; (1901); his fictional autobiographical trilogy, &quot;My Childhood, In the World, My Universities&quot; (1913–1923); and a novel, &quot;Mother&quot; (1906). Gorky himself judged some of these works as failures, and &quot;Mother&quot; has been frequently criticized; Gorky thought of &quot;Mother&quot; as one of his biggest failures. However, there have been warmer appraisals of some of his lesser-known post-revolutionary works such as the novels &quot;The Artamonov Business&quot; (1925) and &quot;The Life of Klim Samgin&quot; (1925–1936); the latter is considered by some as Gorky&#x27;s masterpiece and has been viewed by some critics as a modernist work. Unlike his pre-revolutionary writings (known for their &quot;anti-psychologism&quot;) Gorky&#x27;s later works differ, with an ambivalent portrayal of the Russian Revolution and &quot;unmodern interest to human psychology&quot; (as noted by D. S. Mirsky). He had associations with fellow Russian writers Leo Tolstoy and Anton Chekhov, both mentioned by Gorky in his memoirs.

Gorky was active in the emerging Marxist socialist movement and later supported the Bolsheviks. He publicly opposed the Tsarist regime and for a time closely associated himself with Vladimir Lenin and Alexander Bogdanov&#x27;s Bolshevik wing of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. During World War I, Gorky supported pacifism and internationalism and anti-war protests. For a significant part of his life he was exiled from Russia and later the Soviet Union (USSR), being critical both of the Tsarism and of the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War and the 1920s, condemning the latter for political repressions. In 1928 he returned to the USSR on Joseph Stalin&#x27;s personal invitation and lived there from 1932 until his death in June 1936. After his return he was officially declared the &quot;founder of Socialist Realism&quot;. Despite this, Gorky&#x27;s relations with the Soviet regime were rather difficult: while being Stalin&#x27;s public supporter, he maintained friendships with Lev Kamenev and Nikolai Bukharin, the leaders of the anti-Stalin opposition executed after Gorky&#x27;s death; he also hoped to ease the Soviet cultural policies and made some efforts to defend the writers who disobeyed them, which resulted in him spending his last days under unannounced house arrest.

==Life==
===Early years===

Born as Alexei Maximovich Peshkov on , in Nizhny Novgorod, Gorky became an orphan at the age of eleven. He was brought up by his maternal grandmother and ran away from home at the age of twelve in 1880. After an attempt at suicide in December 1887 he travelled on foot across the Russian Empire for five years, changing jobs and accumulating impressions used later in his writing. 

In 1895, Alexei Maximovich Peshkov, a onetime shoemaker’s apprentice who had quit school at 10,adopted a new name: Maxim Gorky.

As a journalist working for provincial newspapers he wrote under the pseudonym (Jehudiel Khlamida). He started using the pseudonym &quot;Gorky&quot; (from горький; literally &quot;bitter&quot;) in 1892, when his first short story, &quot;Makar Chudra&quot;, was published by the newspaper &quot;Kavkaz&quot; (The Caucasus) in Tiflis where he spent several weeks doing menial jobs, mostly for the Caucasian Railway workshops. The name reflected his simmering anger about life in Russia and a determination to speak the bitter truth. Gorky&#x27;s first book &quot;Очерки и рассказы&quot; (&quot;Essays and Stories&quot;) in 1898 enjoyed a sensational success and his career as a writer began. Gorky wrote incessantly, viewing literature less as an aesthetic practice (though he worked hard on style and form) than as a moral and political act that could change the world. He described the lives of people in the lowest strata and on the margins of society, revealing their hardships, humiliations, and brutalisation, but also their inner spark of humanity.

===Political and literary development===
Gorky&#x27;s reputation grew as a unique literary voice from the bottom stratum of society and as a fervent advocate of Russia&#x27;s social, political, and cultural transformation. By 1899, he was openly associating with the emerging Marxist social-democratic movement, which helped make him a celebrity among both the intelligentsia and the growing numbers of &quot;conscious&quot; workers. At the heart of all his work was a belief in the inherent worth and potential of the human person. In his writing, he counterposed individuals, aware of their natural dignity, and inspired by energy and will, with people who succumb to the degrading conditions of life around them. Both his writings and his letters reveal a &quot;restless man&quot; (a frequent self-description) struggling to resolve contradictory feelings of faith and scepticism, love of life and disgust at the vulgarity and pettiness of the human world.

In 1916, Gorky said that the teachings of the ancient Jewish sage Hillel the Elder deeply influenced his life: &quot;In my early youth I read...the words of...Hillel, if I remember rightly: &#x27;If thou art not for thyself, who will be for thee? But if thou art for thyself alone, wherefore art thou&#x27;? The inner meaning of these words impressed me with their profound wisdom...The thought ate its way deep into my soul, and I say now with conviction: Hillel&#x27;s wisdom served as a strong staff on my road, which was neither even nor easy. I believe that Jewish wisdom is more all-human and universal than any other; and this not only because of its immemorial age...but because of the powerful humaneness that saturates it, because of its high estimate of man.&quot;

He publicly opposed the Tsarist regime and was arrested many times. Gorky befriended many revolutionaries and became a personal friend of Vladimir Lenin after they met in 1902. He exposed governmental control of the press (see Matvei Golovinski affair). In 1902, Gorky was elected an honorary Academician of Literature, but Tsar Nicholas II ordered this annulled. In protest, Anton Chekhov and Vladimir Korolenko left the academy.
From 1900 to 1905, Gorky&#x27;s writings became more optimistic. He became more involved in the opposition movement, for which he was again briefly imprisoned in 1901. In 1904, having severed his relationship with the Moscow Art Theatre in the wake of conflict with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, Gorky returned to Nizhny Novgorod to establish a theatre of his own. Both Konstantin Stanislavski and Savva Morozov provided financial support for the venture. Stanislavski believed that Gorky&#x27;s theatre was an opportunity to develop the network of provincial theatres which he hoped would reform the art of the stage in Russia, a dream of his since the 1890s. He sent some pupils from the Art Theatre School—as well as Ioasaf Tikhomirov, who ran the school—to work there. By the autumn, however, after the censor had banned every play that the theatre proposed to stage, Gorky abandoned the project.

As a financially successful author, editor, and playwright, Gorky gave financial support to the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), as well as supporting liberal appeals to the government for civil rights and social reform. The brutal shooting of workers marching to the Tsar with a petition for reform on 9 January 1905 (known as the &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;), which set in motion the Revolution of 1905, seems to have pushed Gorky more decisively toward radical solutions. He became closely associated with Vladimir Lenin and Alexander Bogdanov&#x27;s Bolshevik wing of the party, with Bogdanov taking responsibility for the transfer of funds from Gorky to Vpered. It is not clear whether he ever formally joined, and his relations with Lenin and the Bolsheviks would always be rocky. His most influential writings in these years were a series of plays on social and political themes, most famously &quot;The Lower Depths&quot; (1902). While briefly imprisoned in Peter and Paul Fortress during the abortive 1905 Russian Revolution, Gorky wrote the play &quot;Children of the Sun&quot;, nominally set during an 1862 cholera epidemic, but universally understood to relate to present-day events. He was released from the prison after a European-wide campaign, which was supported by Marie Curie, Auguste Rodin and Anatole France, amongst others.

Gorky assisted the Moscow uprising of 1905, and after its suppression his apartment was raided by the Black Hundreds. He subsequently fled to Lake Saimaa, Finland. In 1906, the Bolsheviks sent him on a fund-raising trip to the United States with Ivan Narodny. When visiting the Adirondack Mountains, Gorky wrote &quot;Mother&quot;, his probably most famous novel of revolutionary conversion and struggle; despite its success and political impact, various critics and Gorky himself were harsh of the book&#x27;s value as of a work of art. His experiences in the United States—which included a scandal over his travelling with his lover (the actress Maria Andreyeva) rather than his wife—deepened his contempt for the &quot;bourgeois soul&quot;.

===Capri years===

From 1906 to 1913, Gorky lived on the island of Capri in southern Italy, partly for health reasons and partly to escape the increasingly repressive atmosphere in Russia. He continued to support the work of Russian social-democracy, especially the Bolsheviks and invited Anatoly Lunacharsky to stay with him on Capri. The two men had worked together on &quot;Literaturny Raspad&quot; which appeared in 1908. It was during this period that Gorky, along with Lunacharsky, Bogdanov and Vladimir Bazarov developed the idea of an &quot;Encyclopedia of Russian History&quot; as a socialist version of Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;.

In 1906, Maxim Gorky visited New York City at the invitation of Mark Twain and other writers. An invitation to the White House by President Theodore Roosevelt was withdrawn after the &quot;New York World&quot; reported that the woman accompanying Gorky was not his wife. After this was revealed all of the hotels in Manhattan refused to house the couple, and they had to stay at an apartment in Staten Island.

During a visit to Switzerland, Gorky met Lenin, who he charged spent an inordinate amount of his time feuding with other revolutionaries, writing: &quot;He looked awful. Even his tongue seemed to have turned grey&quot;. Despite his atheism, Gorky was not a materialist. Most controversially, he articulated, along with a few other maverick Bolsheviks, a philosophy he called &quot;God-Building&quot; (богостроительство, &quot;bogostroitel&#x27;stvo&quot;), which sought to recapture the power of myth for the revolution and to create religious atheism that placed collective humanity where God had been and was imbued with passion, wonderment, moral certainty, and the promise of deliverance from evil, suffering, and even death. Though &#x27;God-Building&#x27; was ridiculed by Lenin, Gorky retained his belief that &quot;culture&quot;—the moral and spiritual awareness of the value and potential of the human self—would be more critical to the revolution&#x27;s success than political or economic arrangements.

=== World War I and the Civil War ===
An amnesty granted for the 300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty allowed Gorky to return to Russia in 1914, where he continued his social criticism, mentored other writers from the common people, and wrote a series of important cultural memoirs, including the first part of his autobiography. On returning to Russia, he wrote that his main impression was that &quot;everyone is so crushed and devoid of God&#x27;s image.&quot; The only solution, he repeatedly declared, was &quot;culture&quot;.

With Russia entering World War I in 1914 and the outburst of patriotism Gorky became devastated; shortly after the destruction of the Rheims Cathedral, Gorky wrote Andreeva: &quot;All this is so terrible that I am unable to express even one one-hundredth of my heavy feelings, which are perhaps best described in words such as world catastrophe, the downfall of European culture.&quot; At first, Gorky along with the other writers signed a protest against the &quot;barbarism of the Germans&quot;, blaming them for the war, &quot;the despicable paper of the Russian liberals&quot; in Lenin&#x27;s words; later he wrote a series of anti-war publications, but succeeded in publishing only one of them, in which he appealed to feelings of international brotherhood and cooperation; one of the articles was confiscated by the censor, and another was condemned and led the journal being confiscated after being published. While not being a strong &quot;defeatist&quot; like Lenin, Gorky supported &quot;a speedy end of the war and for peace without annexation or indemnities.&quot; In 1915, he launched the publishing house &quot;Parus&quot; and the magazine &quot;Letopis&quot; to spread anti-war stance and &quot;defend the idea of international culture against all manifestations of nationalism and imperialism&quot;; among its prominent writers were the poets Sergei Yesenin, Aleksandr Blok and Vladimir Mayakovsky. Lenin was critical of Gorky&#x27;s position: &quot;In politics Gorky is always weak-willed and subject to emotions and moods.&quot; Gorky&#x27;s best-known publication of the period were concerning antisemitism, written in response to the severe Tsarist repressions against the Jews, and an essay &quot;Two Souls&quot;, which contrasted &quot;the passive East&quot; with &quot;the active West&quot; and promoted the values of European culture and progress and urged Russia to break free from the &quot;Eastern-Asiatic&quot; &quot;soul&quot; and encouraged the Russian bourgeoisie to participate &quot;in the work of reform&quot;. Although the Okhrana, the secret police, had failed to find a legal pretext to close the journal, the government decided to do it in January 1917, but these plans failed because of the February Revolution. Gorky distrusted it at first, but in Spring became cautiously optimist about it. In Summer, Gorky&#x27;s publishing house published one of Lenin&#x27;s most famous writings, &quot;Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism&quot;, with Lenin&#x27;s criticisms of Kautsky removed from the text.

After the February Revolution, Gorky visited the headquarters of the Okhrana on Kronversky Prospekt together with Nikolai Sukhanov and Vladimir Zenisinov. Gorky described the former Okhrana headquarters, where he sought literary inspiration, as derelict, with windows broken, and papers lying all over the floor. Having dinner with Sukhanov later the same day, Gorky grimly predicted that the revolution would end in &quot;Asiatic savagery&quot;. Initially a supporter of the Socialist-Revolutionary Alexander Kerensky, Gorky switched over to the Bolsheviks after the Kornilov affair. In July 1917, Gorky wrote his own experiences of the Russian working class had been sufficient to dispel any &quot;notions that Russian workers are the incarnation of spiritual beauty and kindness&quot;. Gorky admitted to feeling attracted to Bolshevism, but admitted to concerns about a creed that made the entire working class &quot;sweet and reasonable – I had never known people who were really like this&quot;. Gorky wrote that he knew the poor, the &quot;carpenters, stevedores, bricklayers&quot;, in a way that the intellectual Lenin never did, and he frankly distrusted them.

During World War I, his apartment in Petrograd was turned into a Bolshevik staff room, and his politics remained close to the Bolsheviks throughout the revolutionary period of 1917. On the day after the October Revolution of 7 November 1917, Gorky observed a gardener working the Alexander Park who had cleared snow during the February Revolution while ignoring the shots in the background, asked people during the July Days not to trample the grass and was now chopping off branches, leading Gorky to write that he was &quot;stubborn as a mole, and apparently as blind as one too&quot;. Gorky&#x27;s relations with the Bolsheviks became strained, however, after the October Revolution. One contemporary recalled how Gorky would turn &quot;dark and black and grim&quot; at the mere mention of Lenin. Gorky wrote that Vladimir Lenin together with Leon Trotsky &quot;have become poisoned with the filthy venom of power&quot;, crushing the rights of the individual to achieve their revolutionary dreams. Gorky wrote that Lenin was a &quot;cold-blooded trickster who spares neither the honor nor the life of the proletariat. ... He does not know the popular masses, he has not lived with them&quot;. Gorky went on to compare Lenin to a chemist experimenting in a laboratory with the only difference being the chemist experimented with inanimate matter to improve life while Lenin was experimenting on the &quot;living flesh of Russia&quot;. A further strain on Gorky&#x27;s relations with the Bolsheviks occurred when his newspaper &quot;Novaya Zhizn&quot; (&quot;New Life&quot;) fell prey to Bolshevik censorship during the ensuing civil war, around which time Gorky published a collection of essays critical of the Bolsheviks called &quot;Untimely Thoughts&quot; in 1918, which would not be republished in Russia until after the Perestroika. The essays call Lenin a tyrant for his senseless arrests and repression of free discourse, and an anarchist for his conspiratorial tactics; Gorky compares Lenin to both the Tsar and Nechayev.

:&quot;Lenin and his associates&quot;, Gorky wrote, &quot;consider it possible to commit all kinds of crimes ... the abolition of free speech and senseless arrests.&quot;

He was a member of the Committee for the Struggle against Antisemitism within the Soviet government.

In 1921, he hired a secretary, Moura Budberg, who later became his mistress. In August 1921, the poet Nikolay Gumilev was arrested by the Petrograd Cheka for his monarchist views. There is a story that Gorky hurried to Moscow, obtained an order to release Gumilev from Lenin personally, but upon his return to Petrograd he found out that Gumilev had already been shot – but Nadezhda Mandelstam, a close friend of Gumilev&#x27;s widow, Anna Akhmatova wrote that: &quot;It is true that people asked him to intervene. ... Gorky had a strong dislike of Gumilev, but he nevertheless promised to do something. He could not keep his promise because the sentence of death was announced and carried out with unexpected haste, before Gorky had got round to doing anything.&quot; In October, Gorky returned to Italy on health grounds: he had tuberculosis.

In July 1921, Gorky published an appeal to the outside world, saying that millions of lives were menaced by crop failure. The Russian famine of 1921–22, also known as Povolzhye famine, killed an estimated 5 million, primarily affecting the Volga and Ural River regions.

===Second exile===
Gorky left Russia in September 1921, for Berlin. There he heard about the impending Moscow Trial of 12 Socialist Revolutionaries, which hardened his opposition to the Bolshevik regime. He wrote to Anatole France denouncing the trial as a &quot;cynical and public preparation for the murder&quot; of people who had fought for the freedom of the Russian people. He also wrote to the Soviet vice-premier, Alexei Rykov asking him to tell Leon Trotsky that any death sentences carried out on the defendants would be &quot;premeditated and foul murder.&quot; This provoked a contemptuous reaction from Lenin, who described Gorky as &quot;always supremely spineless in politics&quot;, and Trotsky, who dismissed Gorky as an &quot;artist whom no-one takes seriously&quot;. He was denied permission by Italy&#x27;s fascist government to return to Capri, but was permitted to settle in Sorrento, where he lived from 1922 to 1932, with an extended household that included Moura Budberg, his ex-wife Andreyeva, her lover, Pyotr Kryuchkov, who acted as Gorky&#x27;s secretary (initially a spy for Yagoda) for the remainder of his life, Gorky&#x27;s son Max Peshkov, Max&#x27;s wife, Timosha, and their two young daughters.

He wrote several successful books while there, but by 1928 he was having difficulty earning enough to keep his large household, and began to seek an accommodation with the communist regime. The General Secretary of the Communist Party Joseph Stalin was equally keen to entice Gorky back to the USSR. He paid his first visit in May 1928 – at the very time when the regime was staging its first show trial since 1922, the so-called Shakhty Trial of 53 engineers employed in the coal industry, one of whom, Pyotr Osadchy, had visited Gorky in Sorrento. In contrast to his attitude to the trial of the Socialist Revolutionaries, Gorky accepted without question that the engineers were guilty, and expressed regret that in the past he had intervened on behalf of professionals who were being persecuted by the regime. During the visit, he struck up friendships with Genrikh Yagoda (deputy head of the OGPU) who vested interest in spying on Gorky, and two other OGPU officers, Semyon Firin and Matvei Pogrebinsky, who held high office in the Gulag. Pogrebinsky was Gorky&#x27;s guest in Sorrento for four weeks in 1930. The following year, Yagoda sent his brother-in-law, Leopold Averbakh to Sorrento, with instructions to induce Gorky to return to Russia permanently.

===Return to Russia===
Gorky&#x27;s return from Fascist Italy was a major propaganda victory for the Soviets. He was decorated with the Order of Lenin and given a mansion (formerly belonging to the millionaire Pavel Ryabushinsky, which was for many years the Gorky Museum) in Moscow and a dacha in the suburbs. The city of Nizhny Novgorod, and the surrounding province were renamed Gorky. Moscow&#x27;s main park, and one of the central Moscow streets, Tverskaya, were renamed in his honour, as was the Moscow Art Theatre. The largest fixed-wing aircraft in the world in the mid-1930s, the Tupolev ANT-20 was named &quot;Maxim Gorky&quot; in his honour.

He was also appointed President of the Union of Soviet Writers, founded in 1932, to coincide with his return to the USSR. On 11 October 1931 Gorky read his fairy tale poem &quot;A Girl and Death&quot; (which he wrote in 1892) to his visitors Joseph Stalin, Kliment Voroshilov and Vyacheslav Molotov, an event that was later depicted by Viktor Govorov in his painting. On that same day Stalin left his autograph on the last page of this work by Gorky: &quot;This piece is stronger than Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; (love defeats death)&quot; Voroshilov also left a &quot;resolution&quot;: &quot;I am illiterate, but I think that Comrade Stalin more than correctly defined the meaning of A. Gorky&#x27;s poems. On my own behalf, I will say: I love M. Gorky as my and my class of writer, who correctly defined our forward movement.&quot;

As Vyacheslav Ivanov remembers, Gorky was very upset:
=== Visits to Gulag camps ===

In 1933, Gorky co-edited, with Averbakh and Firin, an infamous book about the White Sea–Baltic Canal, presented as an example of &quot;successful rehabilitation of the former enemies of proletariat&quot;. For other writers, he urged that one obtained realism by extracting the basic idea from reality, but by adding the potential and desirable to it, one added romanticism with deep revolutionary potential. For himself, Gorky avoided realism. His denials that even a single prisoner died during the construction of the aforementioned canal was refuted by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who claimed thousands of prisoners froze to death not only in the evenings from the lack of adequate shelter and food, but even in the middle of the day. Most tellingly, Solzhenitsyn and Dmitry Likhachov document a visit, on 20 June 1929 to Solovki, the &quot;original&quot; forced labour camp, and the model upon which thousands of others were constructed. Given Gorky&#x27;s reputation, (both to the authorities and to the prisoners), the camp was transformed from one where prisoners (Zeks) were worked to death to one befitting the official Soviet idea of &quot;transformation through labour&quot;. Gorky did not notice the relocation of thousands of prisoners to ease the overcrowding, the new clothes on the prisoners (used to labouring in their underwear), or even the hiding of prisoners under tarpaulins, and the removal of the torture rooms. The deception was exposed when Gorky was presented with children &quot;model prisoners&quot;, one of who challenged Gorky if he &quot;wanted to know the truth&quot;. On the affirmative, the room was cleared and the 14-year-old boy recounted the truth – starvation, men worked to death, and of the pole torture, of using men instead of horses, of the summary executions, of rolling prisoners, bound to a heavy pole down stairs with hundreds of steps, of spending the night, in underwear, in the snow. Gorky never wrote about the boy, or even asked to take the boy with him. The boy was executed after Gorky left. Gorky left the room in tears, and wrote in the visitor book &quot;I am not in a state of mind to express my impressions in just a few words. I wouldn&#x27;t want, yes, and I would likewise be ashamed to permit myself the banal praise of the remarkable energy of people who, while remaining vigilant and tireless sentinels of the Revolution, are able, at the same time, to be remarkably bold creators of culture&quot;.

In a collection of academic papers about Gorky by the World Literature Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences published in 1995 it was noted that the story about the boy was first told by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; and there was no other testimonies in support of it, that there were never details given about the boy&#x27;s identity, and that the story isn&#x27;t supported by documents: &quot;In the Solovki Museum... information about the real boy was not found; this story is considered to be a legend.&quot; Dmitry Bykov in his biography of Gorky wrote that whether or not did the boy exist, &quot;mass consciousness is structured in such a way that the boy is needed, and it is no longer possible to erase him from Gorky&#x27;s biography&quot;; Gorky&#x27;s biographer Pavel Basinsky makes a similar statement that such &quot;legends&quot; represent &quot;the essence of reality&quot;, but if the boy existed, it would be impossible for Gorky to &quot;take the boy with him&quot; even with his reputation of a &quot;great proletarian writer&quot;: for example, Gorky had to spend over 2 years to free Julia Danzas.

Gorky also helped other political prisoners (not without the influence of his wife, Yekaterina Peshkova). For example, because of Gorky&#x27;s interference Mikhail Bakhtin&#x27;s initial verdict (5 years of Solovki) was changed to 6 years of exile.

===Views on homosexuality===
Gorky strongly supported efforts in getting a law passed in 1934, making homosexuality a criminal offense. His attitude was coloured by the fact that some members of the Nazi Sturmabteilung were homosexual. The phrase &quot;exterminate all homosexuals and fascism will vanish&quot; is often attributed to him. Writing in &quot;Pravda&quot; on 23 May 1934, Gorky said: &quot;There is already a sarcastic saying: Destroy homosexuality and fascism will disappear.&quot;

=== 1930s ===
Gorky was a strong and sincere supporter of such Stalinist policies as usage of forced labour, collectivization and &quot;dekulakization&quot; and the show trials against the saboteurs of the Plan, but being a propagandist for such policies wasn&#x27;t his main role; he was regarded as an &quot;ideological asset&quot; to personify the myth of the &quot;proletarian culture&quot; and bring literature, as Tovah Yedlin writes, under the control of the party, becoming officially praised as &quot;the founder of Socialist Realism in literature&quot;. However, in her political biography of Gorky she also describes his various conflicts with the official cultural policies and the increasing pressure on him towards the end of his life; during his last years, he supported friendly relations with Lev Kamenev and Nikolai Bukharin, the leaders of the opposition which were executed after Gorky&#x27;s death, and he could be sympathetic to the centrist and Right Opposition in general; both Bukharin and Kamenev had been friends with Gorky since 1920s. Paola Cioni noted that although there are traits of a conflict in the relations between Stalin and the state and Gorky, it is uncertain when this conflict was provoked by psychological motives, and when it was provoked by his political position. It is certain, however, that Gorky intervened on behalf of such politically persecuted individuals as the historian Yevgeny Tarle and the literary critic, Mikhail Bakhtin, succeeded in making possible for the writers Yevgeny Zamyatin and Victor Serge to leave the country, tried to intercede on behalf of Karl Radek and Bukharin, and made Kamenev appointed as director of the publishing house &quot;Academia&quot;; Gorky also made efforts to support the literary &quot;fellow travellers&quot; and writers who had troubles with their works being published for ideological or artistic reasons or were disapproved by the official critic.

For example, in letters to Stalin he defended Mikhail Bulgakov, and partly because of Gorky, Bulgakov&#x27;s plays &quot;The Cabal of Hypocrites&quot; and &quot;The Days of the Turbins&quot; were allowed for staging; Gorky took Andrei Platonov to the &quot;writers&#x27; brigades&quot; after he was made unable to be published because of his work critical of the collectivization, although Gorky rejected his &quot;pessimistic&quot; texts; with Gorky&#x27;s intervention, Bukharin became one of the keynote speakers on the Writers&#x27; Congress and proclaimed Boris Pasternak, who was denounced by the Stalinist party critics as &quot;decadent&quot;, to be &quot;first poet&quot; of the USSR. Gorky was not a supporter of artistic pluralism and diversity among writers and agreed that some censorship had to be inevitable, often being dismissive and rigid of creative experiments; however, Gorky was concerned with the bureaucratization of the Union of Writers and tried to oppose the increasing pressure on writers and attacked the party-sanctioned authors and them achieving the highest ranks in the literary bureaucracy. Such Stalin&#x27;s closest associates as Lazar Kaganovich opposed Gorky and Bukharin in their efforts against the increasing party control of literature, and Kaganovich in his letters to Stalin wrote about Gorky&#x27;s ideological faults and the ostensible influence of the Opposition on him. For example, Kaganovich and several Politburo members visited Gorky and demanded his keynote speech for the Congress of Writers to be rewritten, and in his account of the visit, Kaganovich reported that Gorky&#x27;s &quot;mood [was] apparently not very good&quot;, and that the &quot;aftertaste&quot; with which Gorky was critical about some life aspects in the USSR &quot;reminded [him] of Comrade Krupskaya&quot;, Lenin&#x27;s wife who supported the Right Opposition, and that Kamenev seemingly had &quot;an important role in shaping&quot; Gorky&#x27;s &quot;moods&quot;; Kaganovich also proposed to heavily edit Gorky&#x27;s attack on the members of the Organising Committee and publish it so it wouldn&#x27;t circulate illegally. Another act which concerned the Politburo was Gorky&#x27;s support of the members of the RAPP, the former party institution to control literature the members of which fell out of favour after its disbandment; Kaganovich wrote about Gorky supporting the RAPP-led campaign
against Stalin&#x27;s hand-picked leadership of the Organising Committee of the Union and demands to let Leopold Averbakh, the leader of RAPP who was executed in 1937, speak at the congress.

After his arrest in the beginning of 1935, Kamenev wrote a letter to Gorky: &quot;We didn&#x27;t talk with you about politics, and when I told you about the feeling of love and respect for Stalin..., about my readiness to sincerely work with him, that all feelings of resentment and anger burned out in me — I told the truth... I loved you from the bottom of my heart&quot;; Gorky&#x27;s secretary Kryuchkov didn&#x27;t register the letter in Gorky&#x27;s correspondence receipt book, but the hand-written copy in the Gorky archives contains the writer&#x27;s characteristic annotations in red pencil; meanwhile, as Gorky&#x27;s relationship with Stalin worsened, the latter stopped visiting him and replying to his phone calls, and their formal correspondence was almost entirely maintained by Gorky, with Stalin replying occasionally. Later Gorky tried to defend an issue of Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;Demons&quot; which was prepared by Kamenev and came out after his arrest; the novel had a reputation of a &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; work. As the conflict was becoming more visible, Gorky&#x27;s political and literary positions became weaker. Fyodor Panferov, one of the party-sanctioned leaders of the Socialist Realism writers earlier attacked by Gorky, published an answer to him, in which he dismissed his line of criticizing the officially acclaimed Socialist Realism writers while supporting such ostensible enemies of Communism as D. S. Mirsky. David Zaslavsky published an ironic response to Gorky&#x27;s article defending &quot;Demons&quot;, in which he accused Gorky in connivance in the formation of the &quot;counter-revolutionary &quot;intelligentsia&quot;&quot; and directly compared his &quot;liberal position&quot; with the ideological enemies, namely Kamenev and Zinoviev: &quot;Next thing you know you&#x27;ll be calling for publication of White Guard writers&quot;, as Korney Chukovsky summarized in his diary; Gorky&#x27;s second answer to Zaslavsky was not published. During the officially organized campaign against the composer Dmitry Shostakovich, Gorky wrote a letter to Stalin in defense of the composer, demanding a &quot;careful&quot; treatment of him and calling his critics &quot;a bunch of mediocre people, hack-workers&quot; &quot;attack[ing] Shostakovich in every possible way.&quot;

Such sources as Romain Rolland&#x27;s diary demonstrate that because of Gorky&#x27;s refusal to blindly obey the policies of Stalinism, he had lost the Party&#x27;s goodwill and spent his last days under unannounced house arrest.

===Death===

With the increase of Stalinist repression and especially after the assassination of Sergei Kirov in December 1934, Gorky was placed under unannounced house arrest in his house near Moscow in Gorki-10 (the name of the place is a completely different word in Russian unrelated to his surname). His long-serving secretary Pyotr Kryuchkov had been recruited by Yagoda as a paid informer. Before his death from a lingering illness in June 1936, he was visited at home by Stalin, Yagoda, and other leading communists, and by Moura Budberg, who had chosen not to return to the USSR with him but was permitted to stay for his funeral.

The sudden death of Gorky&#x27;s son Maxim Peshkov in May 1934 was followed by the death of Maxim Gorky himself in June 1936 from pneumonia. Speculation has long surrounded the circumstances of his death. Stalin and Molotov were among those who carried Gorky&#x27;s urn during the funeral. During the Bukharin trial in 1938 (last of the three Moscow Trials), one of the charges was that Gorky was killed by Yagoda&#x27;s NKVD agents.

According to several historians, Gorky and his son were poisoned by NKVD chief Genrikh Yagoda on the orders from Stalin and possibly with the assistance of &quot;Kremlin&#x27;s doctors&quot; Pletnyov and Lev Levin using substances developed at a special NKVD laboratory in Moscow.

In Soviet times, before and after his death, the complexities in Gorky&#x27;s life and outlook were reduced to an iconic image (echoed in heroic pictures and statues dotting the countryside): Gorky as a great Soviet writer who emerged from the common people, a loyal friend of the Bolsheviks, and the founder of the increasingly canonical &quot;socialist realism&quot;.

== Major works ==
=== &quot;The Lower Depths&quot; (1902) ===

=== &quot;Mother&quot; (1906) ===

Gorky&#x27;s novel &quot;Mother&quot;, a story of a poor working woman overcoming the life of fear and ignorance in a Russian province and joining the revolutionary cause, is considered one of the most influential novels of the 20th century worldwide, and among Gorky&#x27;s novels, it remains the best known work. It was written in 1906 in the United States with the goal to support the revolutionary mood of the Russian workers by conveying the political agenda among the readers through his work. Gorky himself was highly critical of the novel, saying that it was &quot;an unsuccessful thing, not only in its external appearance, because it is long, boring and carelessly written, but chiefly because it is insufficiently democratic.&quot; The opinion of Gorky have been shared by various literary critics: for example, Marylin Minto notes that the portrayal of Nilovna, the main character of the novel, is very successful, but the other characters are one-dimensional. Richard Freeborn notes that the other characters are little more than &quot;eloquent mouthpieces&quot; of their points of view, yet, Gorky fixes the flaw by projecting them through Nilovna&#x27;s apprehension of them. Despite its artistic flaws, it is still read by general public, and some contemporary reviewers have made favourable comments on it: &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 2016, on the occasion of a new translation of the novel being published, described it as &quot;surprisingly topical&quot; and containing such &quot;eternal themes&quot; as &quot;awakening from a life of fear and ignorance.&quot;

=== &quot;My Childhood. In the World. My Universities&quot; (1915, 1916, 1923) ===

Gorky&#x27;s trilogy of autobiographical prose works, &quot;My Childhood&quot; (1915), &quot;In the World&quot; (1916) and &quot;My Universities&quot; (1923) is regarded by contemporary critics and scholars as one of his major writings; according to &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot;, &quot;considered to constitute one of the finest Russian autobiographies, the books reveal Gorky to be an acute observer of detail with great descriptive powers&quot;; &quot;&#x27;Britannica&quot; writes that the trilogy &quot;contains many messages, which Gorky now tended to imply rather than preach openly: protests against motiveless cruelty, continued emphasis on the importance of toughness and self-reliance, and musings on the value of hard work.&quot; The trilogy was praised by Gorky&#x27;s contemporaries: D. S. Mirsky, for example, wrote that it made Gorky a &quot;great realist&quot;; he also described the trilogy as &quot;one of the strangest autobiographies ever written&quot; for being &quot;about everyone except himself [Gorky]. His person is only the pretext round which to gather a wonderful gallery of portraits.&quot;

=== &quot;The Artamonov Business&quot; (1925) ===

The novel &quot;The Artamonov Business&quot; (1925) has been regarded as one of Gorky&#x27;s finest works of fiction: Irwin Weil has called the novel &quot;perhaps Gorky&#x27;s best single long work of fiction&quot;, while Richard Freeborn calls it Gorky&#x27;s &quot;best novel&quot;. &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot; calls &quot;The Artamonov Business&quot; &quot;one of his [Gorky&#x27;s] best novels&quot;. Geoffrey Grigson wrote that &quot;it is like a less sophisticated &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot;&quot;: it is a chronicle of decline of a family of a pre-revolutionary industrialist family, from the beginning of 1860s to the Revolution of 1917.

<text>In ancient Rome, Appias was a statue of a nymph near the Appiades Fountain in the Forum of Caesar. Ovid wrote that the fountain was in the middle of the Temple of Venus Genetrix and surrounded by statues of nymphs who were called &quot;The Appiades&quot; (; plural form of Appias). Traditionally the Appiades are said to be of Concordia, Minerva, Pax, Venus, and Vesta.

In Roman mythology, Appias was a naiad who lived in the Appian Well outside the temple to Venus Genitrix in the Roman Forum.

In one of his letters, Cicero refers to a statue of Minerva as &quot;Appias&quot;. In this case, he derived this surname from the name of Appius Claudius Pulcher, whom he intended to flatter.

<text>Aradia is one of the principal figures in the American folklorist Charles Godfrey Leland&#x27;s 1899 work &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot;, which he believed to be a genuine religious text used by a group of pagan witches in Tuscany, a claim that has subsequently been disputed by other folklorists and historians. In Leland&#x27;s &quot;Gospel&quot;, Aradia is portrayed as a messiah who was sent to Earth in order to teach the oppressed peasants how to perform witchcraft to use against the Roman Catholic Church and the upper classes.

The folklorist Sabina Magliocco has theorised that prior to being used in Leland&#x27;s &quot;Gospel&quot;, Aradia was originally a supernatural figure in Italian folklore, who was later merged with other folkloric figures such as &quot;sa Rejusta&quot; of Sardinia.

Since the publication of Leland&#x27;s &quot;Gospel&quot;, Aradia has become &quot;arguably one of the central figures of the modern pagan witchcraft revival&quot; and as such has featured in various forms of Neopaganism, including Wicca and Stregheria, as an actual deity. 
Raven Grimassi, founder of the Wiccan-inspired tradition of Stregheria, claims that Aradia was a historical figure named &quot;Aradia di Toscano&quot;, who led a group of &quot;Diana-worshipping witches&quot; in 14th-century Tuscany.

==Folklore==
The Italian form of the name &quot;Herodias&quot; is &quot;Erodiade&quot;. It appears that Herodias, the wife of Herod Antipas, in Christianity of the Early Middle Ages, came to be seen as a spirit condemned to wander the sky forever due to her part in the death of John the Baptist, permitted only to rest in treetops between midnight and dawn.

By the High Middle Ages, this figure seems to have become attached to the train of nymphs of Diana, now also seen as a host of spirits flying through the night across the Italian countryside. Other names attached to the night flight of Herodias included &quot;Minerva&quot; and &quot;Noctiluca&quot;. The canon &quot;Episcopi&quot; is a passage from the work &quot;De ecclesiasticis disciplinis&quot; by Regino of Prüm (written ). It became notable as a paragraph of canon law dealing with witchcraft by the 12th century. Regino reports that there were groups of women who believed that they could go on night journeys where they would fly across the sky to meet Diana and her train. The name of Herodias is not present in the text as attributed to Regino, but in the version by Burchard of Worms, written c. 1012, the reference to Diana (&quot;cum Diana paganorum dea&quot;) was augmented by &quot;or with Herodias&quot; (&quot;vel cum Herodiade&quot;). Magliocco (2002) suggests that the legends surrounding this figure, known as &quot;Aradia&quot;, &quot;Arada&quot; or &quot;Araja&quot;, spread throughout various areas of Italy, and she traced records that showed that two beings known as &quot;s&#x27;Araja dimoniu&quot; (Araja the demon) and &quot;s&#x27;Araja justa&quot; (Araja the just) were found in Sardinia. Magliocco believed that the latter of these two figures, &quot;s&#x27;Araja justa&quot;, was the antecedent of a supernatural witch-like figure known as &quot;sa Rejusta&quot; in Sardinian folklore. Judika Illes, in her &quot;Encyclopedia of Spirits&quot;, noted: &quot;Although venerated elsewhere in Europe, Herodias was especially beloved in Italy. She and Diana are the goddesses most frequently mentioned in witch-trial transcripts and were apparently worshipped together&quot;.

The Romanian historian of religion Mircea Eliade also noted that &quot;Arada&quot;, along with &quot;Irodiada&quot;, was a name used for a Romanian folkloric Queen of the Fairies (&quot;Doamna Zînelor&quot;), who he believed was a &quot;metamorphosis of Diana&quot;. She was viewed as the patroness of a secretive group of dancers known as the calusari who operated up until at least the 19th century.

===Leland&#x27;s Aradia===

In 1899, the American folklorist Charles Godfrey Leland published &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot;, a book which he claimed was the religious text belonging to a group of Tuscan witches who venerated Diana as the Queen of the Witches. He also claimed that he had been given the book by a Tuscan woman named Maddalena, although historians such as Ronald Hutton have disputed the truth of these such claims.

&quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot; begins with the tale of Aradia&#x27;s birth to Diana and Lucifer, who is described as &quot;the god of the Sun and of the Moon, the god of Light (Splendour), who was so proud of his beauty, and who for his pride was driven from Paradise&quot;. Diana instructs Aradia to &quot;go to earth below / To be a teacher unto women and men / Who fain would study witchcraft.&quot; When Aradia descends, she becomes the first of all witches, and promises her students that &quot;ye shall all be freed from slavery, / And so ye shall be free in everything.&quot;

Aradia is described as having continuing power to affect the world after she returns to the sphere of Diana. For example, in &quot;A Spell to Win Love&quot;, the &quot;Invocation to Diana&quot; asks Diana to send her daughter Aradia to perform the magic. Leland&#x27;s &quot;Aradia&quot; has a chapter containing folklore about the night assembly or banquet, titled &quot;The Sabbat: Tregunda or Witch Meeting&quot;, which involves Diana. Leland comments in the Appendix, &quot;I also believe that in this Gospel of the Witches we have a trustworthy outline at least of the doctrine and rites observed at these meetings [the witches&#x27; Sabbat]. They adored forbidden deities and practised forbidden deeds, inspired as much by rebellion against Society as by their own passions.&quot;

Leland speculates that this folklore ultimately has roots in ancient Etruscan mythology.

Leland also equates Aradia with Herodias, explaining his speculation that Herodias was actually Lilith: &quot;This was not ... derived from the Herodias of the New Testament, but from an earlier replica of Lilith, bearing the same name ... So far back as the sixth century the worship of Herodias and Diana by witches was condemned by a Church Council at Ancyra.&quot; Pipernus and other writers have noted the evident identification of Herodias with Lilith. Historian Ronald Hutton suggests in &quot;Triumph of the Moon&quot; that this identification with Herodias was inspired by the work of Jules Michelet in &quot;Satanism and Witchcraft&quot;. Anthropologist and field folklorist Sabina Magliocco, on the other hand, is willing to consider a connection between the Italian Erodiade (Herodias), the Cult of Herodias, the night assembly, and Aradia.

==Neopaganism==
Aradia has become an important figure in witchcraft including Wicca and other forms of Neo-Paganism. Some Wiccan traditions use the name &quot;Aradia&quot; as one of the names of the Great Goddess, Moon Goddess, or &quot;Queen of the Witches&quot;.

Portions of Leland&#x27;s text influenced the Gardnerian Book of Shadows, especially the Charge of the Goddess. Alex Sanders invoked Aradia as a moon goddess in the 1960s. Janet and Stewart Farrar used the name in their &quot;Eight Sabbats for Witches&quot; and &quot;The Witches&#x27; Way&quot;. Aradia was invoked in spellcraft in Z. Budapest&#x27;s &quot;The Holy Book of Women&#x27;s Mysteries&quot;.

Aradia is a central figure in Stregheria, an &quot;ethnic Italian&quot; form of Wicca introduced by Raven Grimassi in the 1980s. Grimassi claims that there was a historical figure called &quot;Aradia di Toscano&quot;, whom he portrays as the founder of a revivalist religion of Italian witchcraft in the 14th century. Grimassi claims that Leland&#x27;s &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot; is a &quot;distorted Christianized version&quot; of the story of Aradia.

Neo-Pagan narratives of Aradia include &quot;The Book of the Holy Strega&quot; (1981), by Raven Grimassi; &quot;The Gospel of Diana&quot; (1993), by Aidan Kelly; and &quot;Secret Story of Aradia&quot;, by Myth Woodling (2001).

In 1992, Aidan Kelly, co-founder of the New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn, distributed a document titled &quot;The Gospel of Diana&quot; (a reference to &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot;). The text contained a list of mother and daughter priestesses who had taught religious witchcraft through the centuries. Instead of Leland&#x27;s goddess Diana and her messianic daughter Aradia, Kelly&#x27;s text described mortal human beings. The priestesses&#x27; names alternated between &quot;Aradia&quot; and &quot;Diana&quot;. Magliocco describes the character of Aradia in Kelly&#x27;s accompanying narrative as &quot;a notably erotic character; according to her teachings, the sexual act becomes not only an expression of the divine life force, but an act of resistance against all forms of oppression and the primary focus of ritual&quot;. Magliocco also notes that the text &quot;has not achieved broad diffusion in contemporary Pagan circles&quot;.

<text>Arria (also Arria Major) was a woman in ancient Rome. Her husband, Caecina Paetus, was ordered by the emperor Claudius to commit suicide for his part in a rebellion but was not capable of forcing himself to do so. Arria wrenched the dagger from him and stabbed herself, then returned it to her husband, telling him that it didn&#x27;t hurt (&quot;Paete, non dolet!&quot;). Her story was recorded in the letters of Pliny the Younger, who obtained his information from Arria&#x27;s granddaughter, Fannia.

==Biography==
Pliny records that Arria&#x27;s son died at the same time as Caecina Paetus was quite ill. She apparently arranged and planned the child&#x27;s funeral without her husband even knowing of his death. Every time she visited her husband, Arria told him that the boy was improving. If emotion threatened to get the better of her, she excused herself from the room and would, in Pliny&#x27;s words, &quot;give herself to sorrow&quot;, and then return to her husband with a calm demeanor.
After the rebellion against Claudius led by Lucius Arruntius Camillus Scribonianus in AD 42, Scribonianus was killed and Caecina was taken to Rome as a prisoner for conspiring with him. Arria begged the captain of the ship to allow her to join him on board. She claimed that if a consular Roman man was allowed slaves to take care of him, then she should save them the trouble and look after him herself. The captain refused, so Arria followed the great ship in a small fishing boat all the way to Rome.

Arria openly attacked the wife of the rebellion leader Scribonianus for giving evidence to the prosecution, crying: 
&quot;Am I to listen to you who could go on living after Scribonianus died in your arms?&quot;
 It was this sentence which alerted everyone to her intention of dying alongside Paetus.

Her son-in-law, Thrasea, attempted to persuade her to live, asking her if she would want her own daughter to kill herself if he were sentenced to death. Arria insisted that she would if her daughter, Arria the Younger, had lived as long and happily with Thrasea as she herself had with Caecina.

She was watched very closely from that point onwards, but, realising this, Arria said that they could not stop her from dying. Having pointed this out, she ran, head first, into a wall and knocked herself out cold. When she came to, she cried: 
&quot;I told you I would do it the hard way if you stopped me from doing it the easy way.&quot;

Arria was eventually permitted to join her husband in a &quot;noble death&quot; (falling on one&#x27;s own sword/dagger).

She is the subject of one of Marcus Valerius Martialis&#x27; epigrams. 

ON ARRIA AND PAETUS.
When the chaste Arria handed to her Paetus the sword which she had with her own hand drawn forth from her heart, &quot;If you believe me,&quot; said she, &quot;the wound which I have made gives me no pain; but it is that which you will make, Paetus, that pains me.&quot;

Sir Ronald Syme, an expert on prosopography, stated in his paper, &#x27;People in Pliny&#x27;, that he could not understand why Arria&#x27;s granddaughter was called Fannia, stating: &quot;Why she should be called &#x27;Fannia&#x27;, no clue.&quot;

<text>Avernus was an ancient name for a volcanic crater near Cumae (Cuma), Italy, in the region of Campania west of Naples. Part of the Phlegraean Fields of volcanoes, Avernus is approximately in circumference. Within the crater is Lake Avernus (&quot;&quot;).

==Role in ancient Roman society==
Avernus was believed to be the entrance to the underworld, and is portrayed as such in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; of Virgil. According to tradition, all birds flying over the lake were destined to fall dead, hence the lake’s name was transferred to Greek as ‚ or &#x27;birdless (lake)&#x27;. This was likely due to the toxic fumes that the mouths of the crater gave off into the atmosphere. In later times, the word was simply an alternative name for the underworld.

On the shores of the lake is the grotto of the Cumaean Sibyl and the entrance to a long tunnel (Grotta di Cocceio, c. ) leading toward Cumae, where her sanctuary was located. There are also the remains of temples to Apollo and Jupiter. During the civil war between Octavian and Antony, Agrippa tried to turn the lake into a military port, the Portus Julius. A waterway was dug from Lake Lucrino to Avernus to this end. The port&#x27;s remains may still be seen under the lake&#x27;s surface.

Avernus was also regarded as a divine being. The 4th-5th century writer Servius the Grammarian described a statue of Avernus, which perspired during the storm after the union of Lake Avernus and Lucrinus Lacus, and to which expiatory sacrifices were offered.
The term &#x27; (plural &#x27;) was also used by ancient naturalists for certain lakes, grottos, and other places which infect the air with poisonous steams or vapors. The Cave of Dogs in Italy was a famous example. The most celebrated of these, however, is Lake Avernus.

They were also called mephites. Mephitis was the Roman goddess of noxious vapors who protected against malaria. The adjective &quot; means &#x27;foul-smelling&#x27; or &#x27;malodorous&#x27;.

<text>The Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) is a protocol for storing and synchronizing general configuration and preference data. It was originally developed so that IMAP clients can easily access address books, user options, and other data on a central server and be kept in synch across all clients.

Two International ACAP Conferences were held, one in Pittsburgh, PA, USA, in 1997, and the other at Qualcomm Incorporated, San Diego, CA, USA, in February 1998.

ACAP grew to encompass several other areas, including bookmark management for web browsers—it&#x27;s effectively a roaming protocol for Internet applications. ACAP is in use by at least four clients and three servers to varying degrees, but it has never achieved the popularity of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol or SyncML. It is a deceptively simple protocol, but the combination of three key features, hierarchical data, fine-grained access control, and &quot;contexts&quot; or saved searches with notification, has caused serious problems for server implementors.

Unlike LDAP, ACAP was designed for frequent writes, disconnected mode access (meaning clients can go offline and then resynchronize later), and so on. It also handles data inheritance, sometimes known as stacking, which provides easy creation of defaults.

The IETF ACAP Working Group ceased activity in April 2004, having released two RFCs, (&quot;ACAP — Application Configuration Access Protocol&quot;) and (&quot;Anonymous SASL Mechanism&quot;).

<text>Hawaii County (; officially known as the County of Hawaiʻi) is a county in the U.S. state of Hawaii in the Hawaiian Islands. It is coextensive with the Island of Hawaii, often called the &quot;Big Island&quot; to distinguish it from the state as a whole. The 2020 Census population was 200,629. The county seat is Hilo. There are no incorporated cities in Hawaii County (see Hawaii Counties). The Hilo Micropolitan Statistical Area includes all of Hawaii County. Hawaii County has a mayor–council form of government. In terms of geography, Hawaii County is the most expansive county in the state and the most southerly county in the United States.

The mayor of Hawaii County is Kimo Alameda, who took office in 2024. Legislative authority is vested in the nine-member Hawaii County Council.

Hawaii County is one of seven counties in the United States to share the same name as the state they are in (the other six are Arkansas County, Idaho County, Iowa County, New York County, Oklahoma County, and Utah County).

==Geography==

Hawaii County has a total area of ; is land and is water (mostly all off the ocean shoreline but counted in the total area by the U.S. Census Bureau). The county&#x27;s land area comprises 62.7 percent of the state&#x27;s land area. It is the highest percentage by any county in the United States. (Delaware&#x27;s Sussex County comes in second at 48.0 percent, while Rhode Island&#x27;s Providence County is third at 39.55 percent.)

==Government and infrastructure==
===County government===

Executive authority is vested in the mayor of Hawaii County, who is elected for a four-year term. Since 2004, the election by the voters has been on a nonpartisan basis. In 2024, Kimo Alameda was elected mayor, defeating Mitch Roth in the general election. Legislative authority is vested in a nine-member County Council. Members of the County Council are elected on a nonpartisan basis to two-year terms from single-member districts. As of December 2016, Hawaii County Council has a female supermajority for the first time, with six women and three men.

Administrative districts were originally based on the traditional land divisions called &quot;Moku&quot; of Ancient Hawaii. Some more heavily populated districts have since been split into North and South districts to make them more comparable on a population basis.

The number following each district is the Tax Map Key (TMK) number, used to locate state property information. They are assigned in a counter-clockwise order beginning on the eastern side of the island.
County council districts do not directly match the property tax districts because of the variation in the population density of voters in urban areas to rural areas; Hilo &amp; Kailua (Kailua-Kona) towns are densely populated areas, while other districts such as Kaū, Puna, Hāmākua, and North &amp; South Kohala are more sparsely populated.

Several government functions are administered at the county level that are at the state or municipal level in other states. For example, the county has its own office of liquor control.

===State government===
Hawaii Department of Public Safety previously operated the Kulani Correctional Facility in Hawaii County, on the Island of Hawaii. In 2009, the Hawaii Department of Public Safety announced that Kulani Correctional Facility would close.

<doc id="85068" wikidata="Q13360597" url="?curid=85068" title="Berkeley sockets">
<text>A Berkeley ([[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]]) socket is an application programming interface (API) for Internet domain sockets and Unix domain sockets, used for inter-process communication (IPC). It is commonly implemented as a library of linkable modules. It originated with the 4.2BSD Unix operating system, which was released in 1983.

A socket is an abstract representation (handle) for the local endpoint of a network communication path. The Berkeley sockets API represents it as a file descriptor in the Unix philosophy that provides a common interface for input and output to streams of data.

Berkeley sockets evolved with little modification from a &quot;de facto&quot; standard into a component of the POSIX specification. The term POSIX sockets is essentially synonymous with &quot;Berkeley sockets&quot;, but they are also known as BSD sockets, acknowledging the first implementation in the Berkeley Software Distribution.

==History and implementations==
Berkeley sockets originated with the 4.2BSD Unix operating system, released in 1983, as a programming interface. Not until 1989, however, could the University of California, Berkeley release versions of the operating system and networking library free from the licensing constraints of AT&amp;T Corporation&#x27;s proprietary Unix.

All modern operating systems implement a version of the Berkeley socket interface. It became the standard interface for applications running in the Internet. Even the Winsock implementation for MS Windows, created by unaffiliated developers, closely follows the standard.

The BSD sockets API is written in the C programming language. Most other programming languages provide similar interfaces, typically written as a wrapper library based on the C API.

===BSD and POSIX sockets===
As the Berkeley socket API evolved and ultimately yielded the POSIX socket API, certain functions were deprecated or removed and replaced by others. The POSIX API is also designed to be reentrant and supports IPv6.

===Alternatives===
The STREAMS-based Transport Layer Interface (TLI) API offers an alternative to the socket API. Many systems that provide the TLI API also provide the Berkeley socket API.

Non-Unix systems often expose the Berkeley socket API with a translation layer to a native networking API. Plan 9 and Genode use file-system APIs with control files rather than file-descriptors.

==Header files==
The Berkeley socket interface is defined in several header files. The names and content of these files differ slightly between implementations. In general, they include:
==Socket API functions==
The Berkeley socket API typically provides the following functions:
* &quot;socket()&quot; creates a new socket of a certain type, identified by an integer number, and allocates system resources to it.
* &quot;bind()&quot; is typically used on the server side, and associates a socket with a socket address structure, i.e. a specified local IP address and a port number.
* &quot;listen()&quot; is used on the server side, and causes a bound TCP socket to enter listening state.
* &quot;connect()&quot; is used on the client side, and assigns a free local port number to a socket. In case of a TCP socket, it causes an attempt to establish a new TCP connection.
* &quot;accept()&quot; is used on the server side. It accepts a received incoming attempt to create a new TCP connection from the remote client, and creates a new socket associated with the socket address pair of this connection.
* &quot;send()&quot;, &quot;recv()&quot;, &quot;sendto()&quot;, and &quot;recvfrom()&quot; are used for sending and receiving data. The standard functions &quot;write()&quot; and &quot;read()&quot; may also be used.
* &quot;close()&quot; causes the system to release resources allocated to a socket. In case of TCP, the connection is terminated.
* &quot;gethostbyname()&quot; and &quot;gethostbyaddr()&quot; are used to resolve host names and addresses. IPv4 only.
* &quot;getaddrinfo()&quot; and &quot;freeaddrinfo()&quot; are used to resolve host names and addresses. IPv4, IPv6.
* &quot;select()&quot; is used to suspend, waiting for one or more of a provided list of sockets to be ready to read, ready to write, or that have errors.
* &quot;poll()&quot; is used to check on the state of a socket in a set of sockets. The set can be tested to see if any socket can be written to, read from or if an error occurred.
* &quot;getsockopt()&quot; is used to retrieve the current value of a particular socket option for the specified socket.
* &quot;setsockopt()&quot; is used to set a particular socket option for the specified socket.

===socket===
The function &quot;socket()&quot; creates an endpoint for communication and returns a file descriptor for the socket. It uses three arguments:
* , which specifies the protocol family of the created socket. For example:
** for network protocol IPv4 (IPv4-only)
** for IPv6 (and in some cases, backward compatible with IPv4)
** for local socket (using a special filesystem node)
* , one of:
** (reliable stream-oriented service or stream sockets)
** (datagram service or datagram sockets)
** (reliable sequenced packet service)
** (raw protocols atop the network layer)
* specifying the actual transport protocol to use. The most common are , , , . These protocols are specified in file &quot;netinet/in.h&quot;. The value may be used to select a default protocol from the selected domain and type.

The function returns if an error occurred. Otherwise, it returns an integer representing the newly assigned descriptor.

===bind===
&quot;bind()&quot; associates a socket with an address. When a socket is created with &quot;socket()&quot;, it is only given a protocol family, but not assigned an address. This association must be performed before the socket can accept connections from other hosts. The function has three arguments:
*sockfd, a descriptor representing the socket
*my_addr, a pointer to a &quot;sockaddr&quot; structure representing the address to bind to.
*addrlen, a field of type &quot;socklen_t&quot; specifying the size of the &quot;sockaddr&quot; structure.
&quot;bind()&quot; returns 0 on success and -1 if an error occurs.

===listen===
After a socket has been associated with an address, listen() prepares it for incoming connections. However, this is only necessary for the stream-oriented (connection-oriented) data modes, i.e., for socket types (SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_SEQPACKET). listen() requires two arguments:
* sockfd, a valid socket descriptor.
* backlog, an integer representing the number of pending connections that can be queued up at any one time. The operating system usually places a cap on this value.
Once a connection is accepted, it is dequeued. On success, 0 is returned. If an error occurs, -1 is returned.

===accept===
When an application is listening for stream-oriented connections from other hosts, it is notified of such events (cf. select() function) and must initialize the connection using function &quot;accept()&quot;. It creates a new socket for each connection and removes the connection from the listening queue. The function has the following arguments:
* sockfd, the descriptor of the listening socket that has the connection queued.
* cliaddr, a pointer to a sockaddr structure to receive the client&#x27;s address information.
* addrlen, a pointer to a &quot;socklen_t&quot; location that specifies the size of the client address structure passed to accept(). When &quot;accept()&quot; returns, this location contains the size (in bytes) of the structure.

&quot;accept()&quot; returns the new socket descriptor for the accepted connection, or the value &quot;-1&quot; if an error occurs. All further communication with the remote host now occurs via this new socket.

Datagram sockets do not require processing by accept() since the receiver may immediately respond to the request using the listening socket.

===connect===
&quot;connect()&quot; establishes a direct communication link to a specific remote host identified by its address via a socket, identified by its file descriptor.

When using a connection-oriented protocol, this establishes a connection. Certain types of protocols are connectionless, most notably the User Datagram Protocol. When used with connectionless protocols, &quot;connect&quot; defines the remote address for sending and receiving data, allowing the use of functions such as &quot;send&quot; and &quot;recv&quot;. In these cases, the connect function prevents reception of datagrams from other sources.

&quot;connect()&quot; returns an integer representing the error code: &quot;0&quot; represents success, while &quot;–1&quot; represents an error. Historically, in BSD-derived systems, the state of a socket descriptor is undefined if the call to &quot;connect&quot; fails (as it is specified in the Single Unix Specification), thus, portable applications should close the socket descriptor immediately and obtain a new descriptor with socket(), in the case the call to connect() fails.

===gethostbyname and gethostbyaddr===
The functions &quot;gethostbyname()&quot; and &quot;gethostbyaddr()&quot; are used to resolve host names and addresses in the domain name system or the local host&#x27;s other resolver mechanisms (e.g., /etc/hosts lookup). They return a pointer to an object of type struct hostent, which describes an Internet Protocol host. The functions use the following arguments:
* name specifies the name of the host.
* addr specifies a pointer to a struct in_addr containing the address of the host.
* len specifies the length, in bytes, of addr.
* type specifies the address family type (e.g., AF_INET) of the host address.

The functions return a NULL pointer in case of error, in which case the external integer may be checked to see whether this is a temporary failure or an invalid or unknown host. Otherwise a valid struct hostent * is returned.

These functions are not strictly a component of the BSD socket API, but are often used in conjunction with the API functions for looking up a host. These functions are now considered legacy interfaces for querying the domain name system. New functions that are completely protocol-agnostic (supporting IPv6) have been defined. These new functions are getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo(), and are based on a new &quot;addrinfo&quot; data structure.

This pair of functions appeared at the same time as the BSD socket API proper in 4.2BSD (1983), the same year DNS was first created. Early versions did not query DNS and only performed /etc/hosts lookup. The 4.3BSD (1984) version added DNS in a crude way. The current implementation using Name Service Switch derives Solaris and later NetBSD 1.4 (1999). Initially defined for NIS+, NSS makes DNS only one of the many options for lookup by these functions and its use can be disabled even today.

==Protocol and address families==
The Berkeley socket API is a general interface for networking and interprocess communication, and supports the use of various network protocols and address architectures.

The following lists a sampling of protocol families (preceded by the standard symbolic identifier) defined in a modern Linux or BSD implementation:
A socket for communications is created with the function, by specifying the desired protocol family (-identifier) as an argument.

The original design concept of the socket interface distinguished between protocol types (families) and the specific address types that each may use. It was envisioned that a protocol family may have several address types. Address types were defined by additional symbolic constants, using the prefix instead of . The -identifiers are intended for all data structures that specifically deal with the address type and not the protocol family.
However, this concept of separation of protocol and address type has not found implementation support and the -constants were defined by the corresponding protocol identifier, leaving the distinction between and constants as a technical argument of no practical consequence. Indeed, much confusion exists in the proper usage of both forms.

The POSIX.1—2008 specification doesn&#x27;t specify any -constants, but only -constants

===Raw sockets===
Raw sockets provide a simple interface that bypasses the processing by the host&#x27;s TCP/IP stack. They permit implementation of networking protocols in user space and aid in debugging of the protocol stack. Raw sockets are used by some services, such as ICMP, that operate at the Internet Layer of the TCP/IP model.

==Blocking and non-blocking mode==
Berkeley sockets can operate in one of two modes: blocking or non-blocking.

A blocking socket does not return control until it has sent (or received) some or all data specified for the operation. It is normal for a blocking socket not to send all data. The application must check the return value to determine how many bytes have been sent or received and it must resend any data not already processed. When using blocking sockets, special consideration should be given to accept() as it may still block after indicating readability if a client disconnects during the connection phase.

A non-blocking socket returns whatever is in the receive buffer and immediately continues. If not written correctly, programs using non-blocking sockets are particularly susceptible to race conditions due to variances in network link speed.

A socket is typically set to blocking or non-blocking mode using the functions fcntl and ioctl.

==Terminating sockets==
The operating system does not release the resources allocated to a socket until the socket is closed. This is especially important if the &quot;connect&quot; call fails and will be retried.

When an application closes a socket, only the interface to the socket is destroyed. It is the kernel&#x27;s responsibility to destroy the socket internally. Sometimes, a socket may enter a state, on the server side, for up to 4 minutes.

On SVR4 systems, use of may discard data. The use of or SO_LINGER may be required on these systems to guarantee delivery of all data.

==Client-server example using TCP==
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented protocol that provides a variety of error correction and performance features for transmission of byte streams. A process creates a TCP socket by calling the function with the parameters for the protocol family (), the socket mode for stream sockets (), and the IP protocol identifier for TCP ().

===Server===
Establishing a TCP server involves the following basic steps:
* Creating a TCP socket with a call to &quot;socket().&quot;
* Binding the socket to the listening port &quot;bind()&quot; after setting the port number.
* Preparing the socket to listen for connections (making it a listening socket), with a call to &quot;listen()&quot;.
* Accepting incoming connections (&quot;accept()&quot;). This blocks the process until an incoming connection is received, and returns a socket descriptor for the accepted connection. The initial descriptor remains a listening descriptor, and &quot;accept()&quot; can be called again at any time with this socket, until it is closed.
* Communicating with the remote host with the API functions &quot;send()&quot; and &quot;recv()&quot;, as well as with the general-purpose functions &quot;write()&quot; and &quot;read()&quot;.
* Closing each socket that was opened after use with function &quot;close()&quot;

The following program creates a TCP server listening on port number 1100:
 #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
 #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
 #include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;
 #include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
 int main(void)
 struct sockaddr_in sa;
 int SocketFD = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP);
 if (SocketFD == -1) {
 perror(&quot;cannot create socket&quot;);
 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 
 memset(&amp;sa, 0, sizeof sa);
 sa.sin_family = AF_INET;
 sa.sin_port = htons(1100);
 sa.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);
 if (bind(SocketFD,(struct sockaddr *)&amp;sa, sizeof sa) == -1) {
 perror(&quot;bind failed&quot;);
 close(SocketFD);
 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 
 if (listen(SocketFD, 10) == -1) {
 perror(&quot;listen failed&quot;);
 close(SocketFD);
 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 
 for (;;) {
 int ConnectFD = accept(SocketFD, NULL, NULL);
 if (ConnectFD == -1) {
 perror(&quot;accept failed&quot;);
 close(SocketFD);
 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 
 /* perform read write operations ... 
 read(ConnectFD, buff, size)
 
 if (shutdown(ConnectFD, SHUT_RDWR) == -1) {
 perror(&quot;shutdown failed&quot;);
 close(ConnectFD);
 close(SocketFD);
 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 close(ConnectFD);

 close(SocketFD);
 return EXIT_SUCCESS; 


===Client===
Programming a TCP client application involves the following steps:
* Creating a TCP socket.
* Connecting to the server (&quot;connect()&quot;), by passing a structure with the set to , set to the port the endpoint is listening (in network byte order), and set to the IP address of the listening server (also in network byte order).
* Communicating with the remote host with the API functions &quot;send()&quot; and &quot;recv()&quot;, as well as with the general-purpose functions &quot;write()&quot; and &quot;read()&quot;.
* Closing each socket that was opened after use with function &quot;close().&quot;
 #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
 #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
 #include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;
 #include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
 int main(void)
 struct sockaddr_in sa;
 int res;
 int SocketFD;

 SocketFD = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP);
 if (SocketFD == -1) {
 perror(&quot;cannot create socket&quot;);
 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 
 memset(&amp;sa, 0, sizeof sa);
 sa.sin_family = AF_INET;
 sa.sin_port = htons(1100);
 res = inet_pton(AF_INET, &quot;192.168.1.3&quot;, &amp;sa.sin_addr);

 if (connect(SocketFD, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;sa, sizeof sa) == -1) {
 perror(&quot;connect failed&quot;);
 close(SocketFD);
 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 
 /* perform read write operations ... */
 close(SocketFD);
 return EXIT_SUCCESS;

==Client-server example using UDP==
The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol with no guarantee of delivery. UDP packets may arrive out of order, multiple times, or not at all. Because of this minimal design, UDP has considerably less overhead than TCP. Being connectionless means that there is no concept of a stream or permanent connection between two hosts. Such data are referred to as datagrams (datagram sockets).

UDP address space, the space of UDP port numbers (in ISO terminology, the TSAPs), is completely disjoint from that of TCP ports.

===Server===
An application may set up a UDP server on port number 7654 as follows. The programs contains an infinite loop that receives UDP datagrams with function &quot;recvfrom()&quot;.
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; /* for close() for socket */ 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main(void)
 int sock;
 struct sockaddr_in sa; 
 char buffer[1024];
 ssize_t recsize;
 socklen_t fromlen;

 memset(&amp;sa, 0, sizeof sa);
 sa.sin_family = AF_INET;
 sa.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);
 sa.sin_port = htons(7654);
 fromlen = sizeof sa;

 sock = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP);
 if (bind(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;sa, sizeof sa) == -1) {
 perror(&quot;error bind failed&quot;);
 close(sock);
 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

 for (;;) {
 recsize = recvfrom(sock, (void*)buffer, sizeof buffer, 0, (struct sockaddr*)&amp;sa, &amp;fromlen);
 if (recsize &lt; 0) {
 fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s\n&quot;, strerror(errno));
 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 printf(&quot;recsize: %d\n &quot;, (int)recsize);
 sleep(1);
 printf(&quot;datagram: %.*s\n&quot;, (int)recsize, buffer);
}
===Client===
The following is a client program for sending a UDP packet containing the string &quot;Hello World!&quot; to address 127.0.0.1 at port number 7654.
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;

int main(void)
 int sock;
 struct sockaddr_in sa;
 int bytes_sent;
 char buffer[200];
 strcpy(buffer, &quot;hello world!&quot;);
 /* create an Internet, datagram, socket using UDP */
 sock = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP);
 if (sock == -1) {
 /* if socket failed to initialize, exit */
 printf(&quot;Error Creating Socket&quot;);
 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 
 /* Zero out socket address */
 memset(&amp;sa, 0, sizeof sa);
 /* The address is IPv4 */
 sa.sin_family = AF_INET;
 /* IPv4 addresses is a uint32_t, convert a string representation of the octets to the appropriate value */
 sa.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;);
 /* sockets are unsigned shorts, htons(x) ensures x is in network byte order, set the port to 7654 */
 sa.sin_port = htons(7654);
 bytes_sent = sendto(sock, buffer, strlen(buffer), 0,(struct sockaddr*)&amp;sa, sizeof sa);
 if (bytes_sent &lt; 0) {
 printf(&quot;Error sending packet: %s\n&quot;, strerror(errno));
 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 
 close(sock); /* close the socket */
 return 0;


In this code, &quot;buffer&quot; is a pointer to the data to be sent, and &quot;buffer_length&quot; specifies the size of the data.

<text>An acceptable use policy (AUP) (also acceptable usage policy or fair use policy (FUP)) is a set of rules applied by the owner, creator, possessor or administrator of a computer network, website, or service that restricts the ways in which the network, website or system may be used and sets guidelines as to how it should be used. AUP documents are written for corporations, businesses, universities, schools, internet service providers (ISPs), and website owners, often to reduce the potential for legal action that may be taken by a user, and often with little prospect of enforcement.

Acceptable use policies are an integral and critical part of the framework of information security policies; it is often common practice to ask new members of an organization to sign an AUP before they are given access to its information systems, just in case. For this reason, an AUP must be concise and clear. While at the same time covering the most important points about what users are, and are not allowed to do with the IT systems of an organization, it should refer users to the more comprehensive security policy where relevant. It should also, and very notably define what sanctions will be applied if a user breaks the AUP. Compliance with this policy should as usual, be measured by regular audits.

In some cases a fair usage policy applied to a service allowing nominally unlimited use for a fixed fee simply sets a cap on what may be used. This is intended to allow normal usage but, prevent what is considered excessive. For example, users of an &quot;unlimited&quot; broadband Internet service may be subject to suspension, termination, or bandwidth limiting for usage which is continually excessive, unfair, affects other users enjoyment of the broadband service. Also, it is not consistent with the usage typically expected on a particular access package. The policy is enforced directly, without legal proceedings.

==Terminology==
AUP documents are similar to and often serve the same function as the &quot;Terms of Service&quot; document (e.g., as used by Google Gmail and Yahoo!), although not always. In the case of IBM for instance, the Terms of Use are about the way in which IBM presents the site, how &quot;they&quot; interact with visitors of the site and little to no instruction as to how to use the site.

In some cases, AUP documents are named &quot;Internet and E-mail Policy&quot;, &quot;Internet AUP&quot;, &quot;Network AUP&quot;, or &quot;Acceptable IT Use Policy&quot;. These documents, even though named differently, largely provide policy statements as to what behavior is acceptable from users of the local network/Internet connected via the local network.

==Common elements of AUP statements==

In general, AUP statements/documents often begin with a statement of the philosophy of the sponsoring organization and intended reason as to why Internet use is offered to the users of that organization&#x27;s network. For example, the sponsoring organization adopts a philosophy of self-regulation and offers the user connection to the local network and also connection to the Internet providing that the user accepts the fact she/he is going to be personally responsible for actions taken when connected to the network or Internet. This may mean that the organization is not going to provide any warning system should the user contravene policy, maintaining that it is up to the user to know when his/her actions are in violation of policy.
Often Acceptable Use Policy documents provide a statement about the use of the network and/or Internet and its uses and advantages to the business, school or other organisation sponsoring connection to the Internet. Such a statement may outline the benefit of email systems, ability to gain information from websites, connection with other people through the use of instant messaging, and other similar benefits of various protocols including the relatively new VoIP services.

The most important part of an AUP document is the code of conduct governing the behaviour of a user whilst connected to the network/Internet. The code of conduct may include some description of what may be called netiquette which includes such items of conduct as using appropriate/polite language while online, avoiding illegal activities, ensuring that activities the user may embark on should not disturb or disrupt any other user on the system, and caution not to reveal personal information that could be the cause of identity theft.

Most AUP statements outline consequences of violating the policy. Such violations are met with consequences depending on the relationship of the user with the organisation. Common actions that schools and universities take is to withdraw the service to the violator and sometimes if the activities are illegal the organization may involve appropriate authorities, such as the local police. Employers will at times withdraw the service from employees, although a more common action is to terminate employment when violations may be hurting the employer in some way, or may compromise security. Earthlink, an American Internet service provider has a very clear policy relating to violations of its policy. The company identifies six levels of response to violations:

* issue warnings: written or verbal
* suspend the Member&#x27;s newsgroup posting privileges
* suspend the Member&#x27;s account
* terminate the Member&#x27;s account
* bill the Member for administrative costs and/or reactivation charges
* bring legal action to enjoin violations and/or to collect damages, if any, caused by violations.

Central to most AUP documents is the section detailing unacceptable uses of the network, as displayed in the University of Chicago AUP. Unacceptable behaviours may include creation and transmission of offensive, obscene, or indecent document or images, creation and transmission of material which is designed to cause annoyance, inconvenience or anxiety, creation of defamatory material, creation and transmission that infringes copyright of another person, transmission of unsolicited commercial or advertising material and deliberate unauthorised access to other services accessible using the connection to the network/Internet. Then there is the type of activity that uses the network to waste time of technical staff to troubleshoot a problem for which the user is the cause, corrupting or destroying other user&#x27;s data, violating the privacy of others online, using the network in such a way that it denies the service to others, continuing to use software or other system for which the user has already been warned about using, and any other misuse of the network such as introduction of viruses.

Disclaimers are often added in order to absolve an organisation from responsibility under specific circumstances. For example, in the case of Anglia Ruskin University a disclaimer is added absolving the University for errors or omissions or for any consequences arising from the use of information contained on the University website. While disclaimers may be added to any AUP, disclaimers are most often found on AUP documents relating to the use of a website while those offering a service fail to add such clauses.

Particularly when an AUP is written for a college or school setting, AUPs remind students (or when in the case of a company, employees) that connection to the Internet, or use of a website, is a privilege not a right. Abuse of privileges can result in legal action from the school.

In a handbook for writing AUP documents, the Virginia Department of Education indicate that there are three other areas needing to be addressed in an AUP:

* a statement that the AUP is in compliance with state and national telecommunication rules and regulations
* a statement regarding the need to maintain personal safety and privacy while accessing the Internet
* a statement regarding the need to comply with Fair Use Laws and other copyright regulations while accessing the Internet

==Enforceability==

6.3 This Policy shall be governed by the laws of England and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of England and Wales. 

Due to the many jurisdictions covered by the Internet, the AUP document needs to specify the jurisdiction, which determines the laws that are applicable and govern the use of an AUP. Even if a company is only located in one jurisdiction and the AUP applies only to its employees, naming the jurisdiction saves difficulties of interpretation should legal action be required to enforce its statements.

AUP can be effectively enforced with Content and URL filters.

<doc id="85075" wikidata="Q494546" url="?curid=85075" title="Kalawao County, Hawaii">
<text>Kalawao County () is a county in the U.S. state of Hawaii. It is the smallest county in the 50 states by land area and the second-smallest county by population, after Loving County, Texas. The county encompasses the peninsula on the north coast of the island of Molokai. The peninsula was developed and used from 1866 to 1969 for settlements for treatment of quarantined persons with Hansen&#x27;s disease (leprosy), chosen because it is isolated from the rest of Molokai by cliffs over a quarter-mile high; the only land access is a mule trail.

Due to the small population (82 as of the 2020 United States census), Kalawao County does not have the same functions as other Hawaii counties. Instead, it operates as a judicial district of Maui County, which includes the rest of the island of Molokai. The county has no elected government.

==History==

The Kingdom of Hawaii, the Republic of Hawaii, the Territory of Hawaii, and the state of Hawaii all exiled persons suffering from Hansen&#x27;s disease (leprosy) to the peninsula, from 1866 to 1969. The quarantine policy was only lifted after effective antibiotic treatments were developed that could be administered on an outpatient basis and patients could be rendered non-contagious.

Many residents chose to remain in their familiar community on the peninsula. The state promised that they could live there for the rest of their lives. As of 2015, the population consisted of the remaining patients, plus state employees and park staff. Tourists 16 years of age and older and personal guests of residents may visit with prior government permission, and the general public must be part of an official tour.

In 1980, the Kalaupapa National Historical Park was established to preserve the county&#x27;s history and environment.

==Government==
Kalawao County lacks a local, county government. Instead, Kalawao County is administered by the Hawaii Department of Health because of the history of the settlement and current patients living there. Under Hawaiian state law, the Director of the Hawaii Department of Health, who is appointed by the Governor, also serves as the Mayor of Kalawao County. The Mayor holds executive powers within the county; the mayor also appoints a county sheriff, who is selected from local residents. The only county statutes that apply to Kalawao County directly are those on matters of health.

Kalawao is part of the First Judicial Circuit, which includes the entire island of Oahu. For the purpose of notarization, the designated venue for the First Judicial Circuit is &quot;State of Hawaii, City and County of Honolulu.&quot;

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , comprising of land and (77.3%) of water. By land area, it is the smallest true county in the United States; some independent cities in Virginia are smaller and are sometimes considered to be &quot;county equivalents&quot; for statistical purposes such as with the US Census Bureau.

===Kalaupapa Peninsula===
Kalaupapa Peninsula contains the county&#x27;s only settlement, Kalaupapa. The Kalaupapa Peninsula developed from lava that erupted from the ocean floor near Kauhakō Crater and spread outward, forming a low shield volcano. This was the most recent volcanic episode on the island and of the larger East Molokai shield volcano, occurring after the formation of the cliffs by erosion.

===Subdivisions===
Kalawao County is composed of four ahupuaʻa. From west to east:
==Demographics==
===2020 census===
===2000 census===
As of the census of 2000, 147 people, 115 households, and 21 families resided in the county, declining to 90 inhabitants in 2010. The population density was . The 172 housing units produced an average density of . The racial makeup of the county was 48% Pacific Islander, 26% White, 17% Asian, 3% from other races, and 6% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race made up 4%. Kalawao County has the highest Pacific Islander population percentage of any U.S. county, and is the only county where they make up a plurality.

2% of households housed children under the age of 18. 17% were married couples living together. 3% had a female householder with no husband present. 81% were non-families. 79% of all households were made up of individuals, and 31% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.28 and the average family size was 2.27.

2% of residents were under the age of 18, 1% from 18 to 24, 18% from 25 to 44, 46% from 45 to 64, and 32% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 59 years. For every 100 females, there were 98.6 males. The population has declined since 1900:

Current residents include 16 former patients, 40 federal employees who work on preservation projects, and some state-employed health workers.

==Transportation==
The only access to Kalawao County is by air, or by a steep mule trail that descends from the rest of Molokai. Kalaupapa Airport has scheduled air service to Molokai Airport and to Honolulu Airport.

Freight is delivered to the county once a year, usually in July, by barge.

==Politics==




Like the rest of the state, Kalawao County is a stronghold for the Democratic Party. It was the only county in the United States where the Republican candidate in the 2016 United States presidential election, Donald Trump, finished in third by only getting one vote; 70% of Kalawao&#x27;s voters chose Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and 25% of Kalawao voters cast their ballots for Green Party candidate Jill Stein, making it Stein&#x27;s strongest county nationwide in terms of vote percentage. In 2020 Joe Biden improved on Clinton&#x27;s 2016 performance by over 25% as the Greens declined to zero votes, giving Biden 96% of the vote, which was his strongest performance in any county in the United States. However, many people in Kalawao County are also socially conservative, with this county being the only one in the state to vote against 2024 Hawaii Amendment 1, which repealed a state constitutional amendment that allowed Hawaii&#x27;s legislature to outlaw same-sex marriage.

==Education==
The county is within the Hawaii Department of Education school district.

<doc id="85080" wikidata="Q232785" url="?curid=85080" title="Father Damien">
<text>Father Damien or Saint Damien of Molokai or Saint Damien De Veuster ( or &#x27;; 3 January 1840 – 15 April 1889), bornJozef De Veuster, was a Roman Catholic priest from Belgium and member of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, a missionary religious institute. He was recognized for his ministry, which he led from 1873 until his death in 1889, in the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi to people with leprosy (Hansen&#x27;s disease), who lived in government-mandated medical quarantine in a settlement on the Kalaupapa Peninsula of Molokai.

During this time, he taught the Catholic faith to the people of Hawaii. Father Damien also cared for the patients and established leaders within the community to build houses, schools, roads, hospitals, and churches. He dressed residents&#x27; ulcers, built a reservoir, made coffins, dug graves, shared pipes, and ate poi with them, providing both medical and emotional support.

After 11 years caring for the physical, spiritual, and emotional needs of those in the leper colony, Father Damien contracted leprosy. He continued with his work despite the infection but finally succumbed to the disease on 15 April 1889. Father Damien also had tuberculosis, which worsened his condition, but some believe the reason he volunteered in the first place was due to tuberculosis.

Father Damien has been described as a &quot;martyr of charity&quot;. Damien De Veuster is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church. In the Anglican Communion and other Christian denominations, Damien is considered the spiritual patron for leprosy and outcasts. Father Damien Day, 15 April, the day of his death, is also a minor statewide holiday in Hawaii. Father Damien is the patron saint of the Diocese of Honolulu and of Hawaii.

Father Damien was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on 11 October 2009. Libert H. Boeynaems, writing in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia,&quot; calls him &quot;the Apostle of the Lepers.&quot; Damien De Veuster&#x27;s feast day is 10 May.

==Early life==
Father Damien was born Jozef (&quot;Jef&quot;) De Veuster, the youngest of seven children and fourth son of the Flemish corn merchant Joannes Franciscus (&quot;Frans&quot;) De Veuster and his wife Anne-Catherine (&quot;Cato&quot;) Wouters in the village of Tremelo in Flemish Brabant in rural Belgium on 3 January 1840. His older sisters Eugénie and Pauline became nuns, and his older brother Auguste (Father Pamphile) joined the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary (Picpus Fathers). Jozef was forced to quit school at age 13 to work on the family farm. His father sent him to a college at Braine-le-Comte to prepare for a commercial profession, but as a result of a mission given by the Redemptorists in 1858, Joseph decided to pursue a religious vocation.

Jozef entered the novitiate of the Fathers of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Mary at Leuven and took in religion the name of Damien, presumably after the first Saint Damien, a fourth-century physician and martyr. He was admitted to the religious profession on 7 October 1860.

His superiors thought that he was not a good candidate for the priesthood because he lacked education. However, he was not considered unintelligent. Because he learned Latin well from his brother, his superiors decided to allow him to become a priest. During his religious studies, Damien prayed daily before a picture of St. Francis Xavier, patron of missionaries, to be sent on a mission. Three years later when his brother Father Pamphile (Auguste) could not travel to Hawaiʻi as a missionary because of illness, Damien was allowed to take his place.

==Mission in Hawaii==
On 19 March 1864, Damien arrived at Honolulu Harbor on Oʻahu. He was ordained into the priesthood on 21 May 1864, at what is now the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace.

In 1865, Damien was assigned to the Catholic Mission in North Kohala on the island of Hawaii. While he was serving in several parishes on Oʻahu, the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi was struggling with a labor shortage and a public health crisis. Many of the Native Hawaiian parishioners had high mortality rates due to infectious diseases such as leprosy (from which he later died), smallpox, cholera, influenza, syphilis, and whooping cough, brought to the Hawaiian Islands by foreign traders, sailors and immigrants. Thousands of Hawaiians died of such diseases, to which they had not acquired immunity.

It is believed that Chinese workers carried leprosy (later known as Hansen&#x27;s disease) to the islands in the 1830s and 1840s. At that time, leprosy was thought to be highly contagious and was incurable. In 1865, out of fear of this contagious disease, Hawaiian King Kamehameha V and the Hawaiian Legislature passed the &quot;Act to Prevent the Spread of Leprosy.&quot; This law quarantined the lepers of Hawaii, requiring the most serious cases to be moved to a settlement colony of Kalawao on the eastern end of the Kalaupapa peninsula on the island of Molokai. Later the settlement of Kalaupapa was developed. Kalawao County, where the two villages are located, is separated from the rest of Molokai by a steep mountain ridge. From 1866 through 1969, about 8,000 Hawaiians were sent to the Kalaupapa peninsula for medical quarantine.

The Royal Board of Health initially provided the quarantined people with food and other supplies, but it did not have the workforce and resources to offer proper health care. According to documents of that time, the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi did not intend for the settlements to be penal colonies. Still, the Kingdom did not provide enough resources to support them. The Kingdom of Hawaii had planned for the lepers to be able to care for themselves and grow their crops. However, due to the effects of leprosy and the peninsula&#x27;s local environmental conditions, this was impractical.

By 1868, according to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1911), &quot;Drunken and lewd conduct prevailed. The easy-going, good-natured people seemed wholly changed.&quot;

=== Mission on Molokai ===
While Bishop Louis Désiré Maigret, the vicar apostolic of the Honolulu diocese, believed that the lepers needed a Catholic priest to assist them, he realized that this assignment had high risk. He did not want to send any one person &quot;in the name of obedience.&quot; After much prayer, four priests volunteered to go, among them Father Damien. The bishop planned for the volunteers to take turns in rotation assisting the inhabitants.

On 10 May 1873, the first volunteer, Father Damien, arrived at the isolated settlement at Kalaupapa, where there were then 600 lepers, and was presented by Bishop Louis Maigret. Damien worked with them to build a church and establish the Parish of Saint Philomena. In addition to serving as a priest, he dressed residents&#x27; ulcers, built a reservoir, built homes and furniture, made coffins, and dug graves. Six months after his arrival at Kalawao, he wrote to his brother, Pamphile, in Europe: &quot;...I make myself a leper with the lepers to gain all to Jesus Christ.&quot;

During this time, Father Damien cared for the lepers and established leaders within the community to improve the state of living. Father Damien aided the colony by teaching, painting houses, organizing farms, and organizing the construction of chapels, roads, hospitals, and churches. He also dressed residents, dug graves, built coffins, ate food by hand with lepers, shared pipes with them, and lived with the lepers as equals. Father Damien also served as a priest during this time and spread the Catholic faith to the lepers; it is said that Father Damien told the lepers that despite what the outside world thought of them, they were always precious in the eyes of God.

Some historians believed that Father Damien was a catalyst for a turning point for the community. Under his leadership, basic laws were enforced, shacks were upgraded and improved as painted houses, working farms were organized, and schools were established. At his request and of the lepers, Father Damien remained on Molokai. Many such accounts, however, overlook the roles of superintendents who were Hawaiian or part-Hawaiian. Pennie Moblo states that until the late 20th century, most historical reports of Damien&#x27;s ministry revealed biases of Europeans and Americans, and nearly completely discounted the roles of the native residents on Molokai. However, it could be asserted that Moblo does not account for the separation of civil authorities and religious authorities. As was customary in the time period, Father Damien&#x27;s work was reported to Europeans and Americans in order to raise funds for the mission. How the colony was governed would be outside the scope of the written accounts and not important to raise funds for the charitable works of Father Damien.

===Recognition during his lifetime===
King David Kalākaua bestowed on Damien the honor of &quot;Knight Commander of the Royal Order of Kalākaua.&quot; When Crown Princess Lydia Liliuokalani visited the settlement to present the medal, she was reported as having been too distraught and heartbroken at the sight of the residents to read her speech. The princess shared her experience, acclaiming Damien&#x27;s efforts. Consequently, Damien became internationally known in the United States and Europe. American Protestants raised large sums of money for the missionary&#x27;s work. The Church of England sent food, medicine, clothing, and supplies to the settlement. It is believed that Damien never wore the royal medal, although it was placed by his side during his funeral.

===Illness and death===

Father Damien worked in Hawaii for 16 years, providing comfort to the lepers of Kalaupapa. In addition to giving the people faith, he built homes for them and he treated them with his medical expertise. He prayed at the cemetery of the deceased and he also comforted the dying at their bedsides.

In December 1884, while he was preparing to bathe, Damien inadvertently put his foot into scalding water, causing his skin to blister. He felt nothing and realized that he had contracted leprosy after working in the colony for 11 years. This was a common way for people to discover that they had been infected with leprosy. Despite his illness, Damien worked even harder.

In 1885, Masanao Goto, a Japanese leprologist, came to Honolulu and treated Damien. He believed that leprosy was caused by a diminution of the blood. His treatment consisted of nourishing foods, moderate exercise, frequent friction to the benumbed parts, special ointments, and medical baths. The treatments relieved some of the symptoms and they were very popular with the Hawaiian patients as a result. Damien had faith in the treatments and said that he only wanted to be treated by Goto, who eventually became a good friend of Father Damien.

Despite the fact that the illness was slowing his body down, Damien engaged in a flurry of activities during his last years. With his remaining time, he tried to advance and complete as many projects as possible. While he was continuing to spread the Catholic Faith and aid the lepers during their treatments, Damien completed several building projects and improved orphanages. Four volunteers arrived at Kalaupapa to help the ailing missionary: a Belgian priest, Louis Lambert Conrardy; a soldier, Joseph Dutton (an American Civil War veteran who left behind a marriage which had been broken by his alcoholism); a male nurse from Chicago, James Sinnett; and Mother (now Saint) Marianne Cope, who had been the head of the Franciscan-run St Joseph&#x27;s Hospital in Syracuse, New York. Conrardy took up Damien&#x27;s pastoral duties. Cope organized a working hospital. Dutton attended to the construction and maintenance of the community&#x27;s buildings. Sinnett nursed Damien during the last phases of his illness.

With an arm in a sling, with a foot in bandages, and with his leg dragging, Damien knew that his death was near. He was bedridden on 23 March 1889, and on 30 March, he made a general confession. Damien died of leprosy at 8:00 a.m. on 15 April 1889, at the age of 49. The next day, after the Mass was said by Father Moellers at St. Philomena&#x27;s, the whole settlement followed the funeral cortège to the cemetery. Damien was laid to rest under the same pandanus tree where he first slept upon his arrival on Molokai.

In January 1936, at the request of King Leopold III of Belgium and the Belgian government, Damien&#x27;s body was returned to his native land in Belgium. It was transported aboard the Belgian ship &quot;Mercator.&quot; Damien was buried in Leuven, the historic university city which is close to the village where he was born. After Damien&#x27;s beatification in June 1995, the remains of his right hand were returned to Hawaii and re-interred in his original grave on Molokai.

== Commentary after his death ==

Father Damien had become internationally known before his death, because he was seen as a symbolic Christian figure who spent his life caring for the afflicted natives. His superiors thought that Damien lacked education and finesse but they considered him to be &quot;an earnest peasant hard at work in his own way for God.&quot; News of his death on 15 April was quickly carried across the globe by the modern communications of the time, by steamship to Honolulu and California, telegraph to the East Coast of the United States, and cable to England, reaching London on 11 May. Following an outpouring of praise for his work, other voices began to be heard in Hawaii.

Representatives of the Congregational and Presbyterian churches in Hawaii criticized his approach. Reverend Charles McEwen Hyde, a Presbyterian minister in Honolulu, wrote to his fellow pastor Reverend H. B. Gage of San Francisco in August. Hyde referred to Father Damien as &quot;a coarse, dirty man,&quot; who contracted leprosy due to &quot;carelessness.&quot; Hyde said that Damien was mistakenly being given credit for reforms which had actually been implemented by the Board of Health. Without consulting Hyde, Gage had the letter published in a San Francisco newspaper, generating comment and controversy in the US and Hawaii.

Later in 1889, the Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson and his family arrived in Hawaii for an extended stay. He had tuberculosis, a disease which was also considered incurable, and he was seeking some relief for it. Moved by Damien&#x27;s story, he became interested in the priest&#x27;s controversy and went to Molokai for eight days and seven nights. Stevenson wanted to learn more about Damien at the place where he had worked. He spoke with residents of various religious backgrounds in order to learn more about Damien&#x27;s work. Based on his conversations and observations, he wrote an open letter to Hyde in which he addressed the minister&#x27;s criticisms and he had it printed at his own expense. Stevenson&#x27;s letter became the most famous account of Damien, featuring him in the role of a European who was aiding the native people.

In his &quot;6,000-word polemic,&quot; Stevenson praised Damien extensively, writing to Hyde:

Stevenson referred to his journal entries in his letter:

Mahatma Gandhi said that Father Damien&#x27;s work had inspired his social campaigns in India, leading to the independence of his people and the securing of aid for needy Indians. Gandhi was quoted in T.N. Jagadisan&#x27;s 1965 publication &quot;Mahatma Gandhi Answers the Challenge of Leprosy&quot;:

==Canonization==

In 1977, Pope Paul VI declared Father Damien to be venerable. On 4 June 1995, Pope John Paul II beatified him, by which he would be known by the official spiritual title of Blessed. On 20 December 1999, Jorge Medina Estévez, Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, confirmed the November 1999 decision of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops to include Blessed Damien in the national liturgical calendar with the rank of an optional memorial. Father Damien was canonized on 11 October 2009 by Pope Benedict XVI. His feast day is celebrated on 10 May. In Hawaii, it is celebrated on the day of his death, 15 April.

Prior to his beatification, two miracles were attributed to Father Damien&#x27;s posthumous intercession. On 13 June 1992, Pope John Paul II approved the cure of a religious sister in France in 1895 as a miracle attributed to Venerable Damien&#x27;s intercession. In that case, Sister Simplicia Hue began a novena to Father Damien as she lay dying of a lingering intestinal illness. It is stated that the pain and symptoms of the illness disappeared overnight.

In the second case, Audrey Toguchi, a Hawaiian woman who suffered from a rare form of cancer, had remission after having prayed at the grave of Father Damien on Molokai. There was no medical explanation, as her prognosis was terminal. In 1997, Toguchi was diagnosed with liposarcoma, a cancer that arises in fat cells. She underwent surgery a year later and a tumor was removed, but the cancer metastasized to her lungs. Her physician, Dr. Walter Chang, told her, &quot;Nobody has ever survived this cancer. It&#x27;s going to take you.&quot; Toguchi was still alive in 2016.

In April 2008, the Holy See accepted the two cures as evidence of Father Damien&#x27;s sanctity. On 2 June 2008, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints voted to recommend raising Father Damien of Molokai to sainthood. The decree that officially notes and verifies the miracle needed for canonization was approved by Pope Benedict XVI and promulgated by Cardinal José Saraiva Martins on 3 July 2008, with the actual ceremony of beatification taking place in Rome and celebrations in Belgium and Hawaii. On 21 February 2009, the Holy See announced that Father Damien would be canonized. The ceremony of canonization took place in Rome on Sunday, 11 October 2009, in the presence of King Albert II of the Belgians and Queen Paola as well as the Belgian Prime Minister, Herman Van Rompuy, and several cabinet ministers. In Washington, D.C., President Barack Obama affirmed his deep admiration for St. Damien, saying that he gave voice to the voiceless and dignity to the sick. Four other individuals were canonized with Father Damien that the same day: Zygmunt Szczęsny Feliński, Sister Jeanne Jugan, Father Francisco Coll Guitart and Rafael Arnáiz Barón.

Damien is honored, together with Marianne Cope, with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on 15 April.

==In arts and media==
===Films===
* Director David Miller made a short film about Father Damien&#x27;s life entitled &quot;The Great Heart&quot; (1938), released by MGM.
* The first full-length film about Father Damien was &quot;Molokai&quot; (1959), a Spanish production which was directed by Luis Lucia with Javier Escrivá, Roberto Camardiel, and Gérard Tichy playing the main roles.
* Ken Howard played the title role in the television film &quot;Father Damien: The Leper Priest&quot; (1980); he replaced David Janssen, who died suddenly after several days of shooting.
* Stephanie J. Castillo&#x27;s documentary &quot;Simple Courage&quot; (1992) explores Damien and his work, drawing parallels between the treatment of persons who have leprosy and the stigma which is associated with persons who have HIV/AIDS. &quot;Simple Courage&quot; was rewarded an EMMY Award in 1993.
* The Belgian film producer Tharsi Vanhuysse produced and Paul Cox directed the film &quot;&quot; (1999) with David Wenham as Damien.
* Interviews which were conducted by former residents are featured in the documentary &quot;The Soul of Kalaupapa: Voices of Exile&quot; (2011). It focuses on the efforts of Belgian-born Father Damien in the 19th century and the efforts of Jonatana Napela, a Hawaiian LDS convert who works with persons with leprosy in Kalaupapa and collaborates on ecumenical efforts.

===Literature===
* Screenwriter and film director John Farrow wrote the biography &quot;Damien the Leper&quot; (1937). In 1939, RKO Pictures purchased the book for a feature film titled &quot;Father Damien&quot;, to be directed by Farrow and star Joseph Calleia. The project was not realized.
* The poetic dramatization &quot;Father Damien&quot; (1938) was written by Edward Snelson, later Joint Secretary to the Government of India (1947), KBE, and dedicated &#x27;To G.,&#x27; the actress Greer Garson, to whom he had been married in 1933.
* The one-person play &quot;Damien&quot; by Aldyth Morris was broadcast nationally on PBS in the United States in 1978 and again in 1986 on &quot;American Playhouse.&quot; The broadcast received several recognitions, including a Peabody Award.
* The 2016 novel &quot;God Made Us Monsters&quot; by William Neary explores Father Damien&#x27;s rise to sainthood.

===Monuments and statues===

* The Father Damien Statue on the steps of the State Capitol Building honors him, and a replica is displayed in the National Statuary Hall Collection in the United States Capitol. Statues in memory of Damien can be found in many Belgian cathedrals, such as the Tournai Cathedral, St Bavo&#x27;s Cathedral, Ghent, and St Martin&#x27;s Cathedral, Ypres.
* A monument stands in front of St. Benedict&#x27;s Catholic Church in Honaunau (Hawaii) and is often decorated with Leis.

==Legacy and honors==

In 2005, Damien was honored with the title of &quot;De Grootste Belg&quot;, chosen as &quot;The Greatest Belgian&quot; throughout that country&#x27;s history, in polling conducted by the Flemish public broadcasting service, VRT. He ranked third on &quot;Le plus grand Belge&quot; (&quot;The Greatest Belgian&quot;) in a poll by the French-speaking public channel RTBF.

In 1952, the Picpus Fathers (SS .CC) opened the in Tremelo, Belgium, in the house where Damien was born and grew up. In 2017, the museum was completely renovated.

With his canonization highlighting his ministry to persons with leprosy, Father Damien&#x27;s work has been cited as an example of how society should minister to HIV/AIDS patients. On the occasion of Damien&#x27;s canonization, President Barack Obama stated, &quot;In our own time, as millions around the world suffer from disease, especially the pandemic of HIV/AIDS, we should draw on the example of Father Damien&#x27;s resolve in answering the urgent call to heal and care for the sick.&quot; Several clinics and centers nationwide catering to HIV/AIDS patients bear his name. There is a chapel named for him and dedicated to people with HIV/AIDS, in St. Thomas the Apostle Hollywood, an Episcopal parish.

The Damien The Leper Society is among charities named after him that work to treat and control leprosy. Damien House, Ireland, is a centre for &quot;peace for families and individuals affected by bereavement, stress, violence, and other difficulties with particular attention to Northern Ireland&quot;. Saint Damien Advocates is a religious freedom organization that says it wants to carry on Father Damien&#x27;s work with orphans and others.

Schools which are named after him include Damien High School in Southern California, Saint Damien Elementary School in Calgary, Canada, and Damien Memorial School in Hawaii.

St. Damien of Molokai Catholic Church in Edmond, Oklahoma, dedicated in 2010, is believed to have been the first Roman Catholic church in the continental United States to be named for Saint Damien after his canonization. A Traditional Latin Mass church, it is operated by the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter (FSSP) and was authorized in 2010 by Eusebius J. Beltran, Archbishop of Oklahoma City. Pontiac, Michigan (in the Catholic archdiocese of Detroit) has a St. Damien parish.

Marianne of Molokaʻi was canonized in 2012.

<text>The Citroën 2CV (, , lit. &quot;two horses&quot;, meaning &quot;two &quot;taxable&quot; horsepower&quot;) is an economy car produced by the French company Citroën from 1948 to 1990. Introduced at the 1948 Paris Salon de l&#x27;Automobile, it has an air-cooled engine that is mounted in the front and drives the front wheels.

Conceived by Citroën Vice-President Pierre Boulanger to help motorise the large number of farmers still using horses and carts in 1930s France, the 2CV has a combination of innovative engineering and straightforward, utilitarian bodywork. The 2CV featured overall low cost of ownership, simplicity of maintenance, an easily serviced air-cooled engine (originally offering ), and minimal fuel consumption. In addition, it had been designed to cross a freshly ploughed field with a basket full of eggs on the passenger&#x27;s seat without breaking them, because of the great lack of paved roads in France at the time; with a long-travel suspension system, that connects front and rear wheels, giving a very soft ride.

Often called &quot;an umbrella on wheels&quot;, the fixed-profile convertible bodywork featured a full-width, canvas, roll-back sunroof, which accommodated oversized loads, and until 1955 even stretched to cover the car&#x27;s trunk, reaching almost down to the car&#x27;s rear bumper. Michelin introduced and first commercialised the revolutionary new radial tyre design with the introduction of the 2CV.

Between 1948 and 1990, more than 3.8 million 2CVs were produced, making it the world&#x27;s first front-wheel drive car to become a million seller after Citroën&#x27;s own earlier model, the more upmarket Traction Avant, which had become the first front-wheel drive car to sell in similar six-figure numbers. The 2CV platform spawned many variants; the 2CV and its variants are collectively known as the &quot;A-Series.&quot; Notably these include the 2CV-based delivery vans known as &quot;fourgonnettes&quot;, the Ami, the Dyane, the Acadiane, and the Mehari. In total, Citroën manufactured over 9 million of the 2CVs and its derivative models.

A 1953 technical review in &quot;Autocar&quot; described &quot;the extraordinary ingenuity of this design, which is undoubtedly the most original since the Model T Ford&quot;. In 2011, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; called it a &quot;car like no other&quot;. The motoring writer L. J. K. Setright described the 2CV as &quot;the most intelligent application of minimalism ever to succeed as a car&quot;, and a car of &quot;remorseless rationality&quot;.

Both the design and the history of the 2CV mirror the Volkswagen Beetle in significant ways. Conceived in the 1930s, to make motorcars affordable to regular people for the first time in their countries, both went into large scale production in the late 1940s, featuring air-cooled boxer engines at the same end as their driven axle, omitting a length-wise drive shaft, riding on exactly the same wheelbase, and using a platform chassis to facilitate the production of derivative models. Just like the Beetle, the 2CV became not only a million seller but also one of the few cars in history to continue a single generation in production for over four decades.

A prototype was developed in the late 1990s under the name &quot;Citroën 2CV 2000&quot;. However, it did not go into production.

== History ==

=== Pre-production ===

In 1934, family-owned Michelin, as the largest creditor, took over the bankrupt Citroën company. The new management commissioned a market survey, conducted by Jacques Duclos. France at that time had a large rural population which could not yet afford cars; Citroën used the survey results to prepare a design brief for a low-priced, rugged &quot;umbrella on four wheels&quot; that would enable four people to transport of farm goods to market at , if necessary across muddy, unpaved roads. In fuel economy, the car would use no more than . One design parameter required that customers be able to transport eggs across a freshly ploughed field without breakage.

In 1936, Pierre-Jules Boulanger, vice-president of Citroën and chief of engineering and design, sent the brief to his design team at the engineering department. The TPV (Toute Petite Voiture – &quot;Very Small Car&quot;) was to be developed in secrecy at Michelin facilities at Clermont-Ferrand and at Citroën in Paris, by the design team who had created the Traction Avant.

Boulanger closely monitored all decisions relating to the TPV, proposing strictly reduced target weights. He created a department to weigh and redesign each component, to lighten the TPV without compromising function.

Boulanger placed engineer André Lefèbvre in charge of the TPV project. Lefèbvre had designed and raced Grand Prix cars; his speciality was chassis design and he was particularly interested in maintaining contact between tyres and the road surface.

The first prototypes were bare chassis with rudimentary controls, seating and roof; test drivers wore leather flying suits, of the type used in contemporary open biplanes. By the end of 1937 20 TPV experimental prototypes had been built and tested. The prototypes had only one headlight, all that was required by French law at the time. On 29 December 1937, Pierre Michelin was killed in a car crash; Boulanger became president of Citroën.

By 1939 the TPV was deemed ready, after 47 technically different and incrementally improved experimental prototypes had been built and tested. These prototypes used aluminium and magnesium parts and had water-cooled flat twin engines with front-wheel drive. The seats were hammocks hung from the roof by wires. The suspension system, designed by Alphonse Forceau, used front leading arms and rear trailing arms, connected to eight torsion bars beneath the rear seat: a bar for the front axle, one for the rear axle, an intermediate bar for each side, and an overload bar for each side. The front axle was connected to its torsion bars by cable. The overload bar came into play when the car had three people on board, two in the front and one in the rear, to support the extra load of a fourth passenger and fifty kilograms of luggage.

In mid-1939 a pilot run of 250 cars was produced and on 28 August 1939 the car received approval for the French market. Brochures were printed and preparations made to present the car, renamed the Citroën 2CV, at the forthcoming Paris Motor Show in October 1939.

One innovation included from the beginning of production was Michelin&#x27;s new radial tyre, first commercialised with the introduction of the 2CV. This radial design is an integral part of the design of the 2CV chassis.

=== World War II ===
On 3 September 1939, France declared war on Germany following their invasion of Poland. An atmosphere of impending disaster led to the cancellation of the 1939 motor show less than a month before it was scheduled to open. The launch of the 2CV was abandoned.

During the German occupation of France in World War II Boulanger personally refused to collaborate with German authorities to the point where the Gestapo listed him as an &quot;enemy of the Reich&quot;, under constant threat of arrest and deportation to Germany.

Michelin (Citroën&#x27;s main shareholder) and Citroën managers decided to hide the TPV project from the Nazis, fearing some military application as in the case of the future Volkswagen Beetle, manufactured during the war as the military Kübelwagen. Several TPVs were buried at secret locations; one was disguised as a pickup, the others were destroyed, and Boulanger spent the next six years thinking about further improvements. Until 1994, when three TPVs were discovered in a barn, it was believed that only two prototypes had survived. As of 2003, there were five known TPVs.

By 1941, after an increase in aluminium prices of 40%, an internal report at Citroën showed that producing the TPV post-war would not be economically viable, given the projected further increasing cost of aluminium. Boulanger decided to redesign the car to use mostly steel with flat panels, instead of aluminium. The Nazis had attempted to loot Citroën&#x27;s press tools; this was frustrated after Boulanger got the French Resistance to relabel the rail cars containing them in the Paris marshalling yard. They ended up all over Europe, and Citroën was by no means sure they would all be returned after the war. In early 1944 Boulanger made the decision to abandon the water-cooled two-cylinder engine developed for the car and installed in the 1939 versions. Walter Becchia was now briefed to design an air-cooled unit, still of two cylinders, and still of 375 cc. Becchia was also supposed to design a three-speed gearbox, but managed to design a four-speed for the same space at little extra cost. At this time small French cars like the Renault Juvaquatre and Peugeot 202 usually featured three-speed transmissions, as did Citroën&#x27;s own mid-size Traction Avant – but the 1936 Italian Fiat 500 &quot;Topolino&quot; &quot;people&#x27;s car&quot; did have a four-speed gearbox. Becchia persuaded Boulanger that the fourth gear was an overdrive. The increased number of gear ratios also helped to pull the extra weight of changing from light alloys to steel for the body and chassis. Other changes included seats with tubular steel frames with rubber band springing and a restyling of the body by the Italian Flaminio Bertoni. Also, in 1944 the first studies of the Citroën hydro-pneumatic suspension were conducted using the TPV/2CV.

The development and production of what was to become the 2CV was also delayed by the incoming 1944 Socialist French government, after the liberation by the Allies from the Germans. The five-year &quot;Plan Pons&quot; to ration car production and husband scarce resources, named after economist and former French motor industry executive Paul-Marie Pons, only allowed Citroën the upper middle range of the car market, with the Traction Avant. The French government allocated the economy car market, US Marshall Plan aid, US production equipment and supplies of steel, to newly nationalised Renault to produce its Renault 4CV. The &quot;Plan Pons&quot; came to an end in 1949. Postwar French roads were very different from pre-war ones. Horse-drawn vehicles had re-appeared in large numbers. The few internal combustion-engined vehicles present often ran on town gas stored in gasbags on roofs or wood/charcoal gas from gasifiers on trailers. Only 100,000 of the two million pre-war cars were still on the road. The time was known as &quot;Les années grises&quot; or &quot;the grey years&quot; in France.

=== Development ===

Citroën unveiled the car at the Paris Salon on 7 October 1948. The car on display was nearly identical to the &quot;2CV type A&quot; that would be sold the next year, but it lacked an electric starter, the addition of which was decided the day before the opening of the Salon, replacing the pull cord starter. The canvas roof could be rolled completely open. The Type A had one stop light, and was available only in grey. The fuel level was checked with a dipstick/measuring rod, and the speedometer was attached to the windscreen pillar. The only other instrument was an ammeter.

=== Production ===

==== 1949–1959 ====

In 1949, the first delivered 2CV type A was 375 cc, , with a top speed, only one tail light and windscreen wiper with speed shaft drive; the wiper speed was dependent on the driving speed. There was no fuel gauge; Citroën provided a dipstick below the petrol filler cap. The 2CV was the first car designed around and released with radial tires.

The car was heavily criticised by the motoring press and became the butt of French comedians for a short while. The British &quot;Autocar&quot; correspondent wrote that the 2CV &quot;...is the work of a designer who has kissed the lash of austerity with almost masochistic fervour&quot;. One American motoring journalist quipped, &quot;Does it come with a can opener?&quot;

Despite critics, Citroën was flooded with customer orders at the show. The car had a great impact on the lives of the low-income segment of the population in France. The 2CV was a commercial success: within months of it going on sale, there was a three-year waiting list, which soon increased to five years. At the time a second-hand 2CV was more expensive than a new one because the buyer did not have to wait. Production was increased from 876 units in 1949 to 6,196 units in 1950.

Grudging respect began to emanate from the international press: towards the end of 1951 the opinion appeared in Germany&#x27;s recently launched &quot;Auto, Motor und Sport&quot; magazine that, despite its &quot;ugliness and primitiveness&quot; &quot;(&quot;Häßlichkeit und Primitivität&quot;)&quot;, the 2CV was a &quot;highly interesting&quot; &quot;(&quot;hochinteressantes&quot;)&quot; car.

In 1950, Pierre-Jules Boulanger was killed in a car crash on the main road from Clermont-Ferrand (the home of Michelin) to Paris.

In 1951, the 2CV received an ignition lock and a lockable driver&#x27;s door. Production reached 100 cars a week. By the end of 1951 production totalled 16,288. Citroën introduced the 2CV Fourgonnette panel van. The &quot;Weekend&quot; version of the van had collapsible, removable rear seating and rear side windows, enabling a tradesman to use it as a family vehicle on the weekend as well as for business in the week.

By 1952, production had reached more than 21,000 with export markets earning foreign currency taking precedence. Boulanger&#x27;s policy, which continued after his death, was: &quot;Priority is given to those who have to travel by car because of their work and for whom ordinary cars are too expensive to buy.&quot; Cars were sold preferentially to country vets, doctors, midwives, priests and small farmers. In 1954, the speedometer got a light for night driving. In 1955, the 2CV side repeaters were added above and behind the rear doors. It was now also available with 425 cc (AZ), and a top speed of . In 1957, a heating and ventilation system was installed. The colour of the steering wheel changed from black to grey. The mirrors and the rear window were enlarged. The bonnet was decorated with a longitudinal strip of aluminium (AZL). In September 1957, the model AZLP (P for &quot;porte de malle&quot;, &quot;boot lid&quot;), appeared with a boot lid panel; previously the soft top had to be opened at the bottom to get to the boot. In 1958, a Belgian Citroën plant produced a higher quality version of the car (AZL3). It had a third side window, not available in the normal version and improved details.

==== 1960–1969 ====
In 1960, the production of the 375 cc engine ended. The corrugated metal bonnet was replaced by a five-rib glossy cover. Simultaneously, the grille was slightly modified (flatter shape with a curved top edge).Rectangular turn signals were integrated to the front wings on the AZAM export model; these became round on post-1970 cars when indicators were fitted to the rear of the car too. As a result the flashers disappeared from their traditional home high on the rear three quarter panel.

The &quot;2 CV 4 × 4&quot; 2CV Sahara appeared in December 1960. This had an additional engine-transmission unit in the rear, mounted the other way around and driving the rear wheels. For the second engine there was a separate push-button starter and choke. With a gearstick between the front seats, both transmissions were operated simultaneously. For the two engines, there were separate petrol tanks under the front seats. The filler neck sat in the front doors. Both engines (and hence axles) could be operated independently. The spare wheel was mounted on the bonnet. The car had ample off-road capability, but at twice the price of the standard 2CV. 694 were produced until 1968 and one more in 1971. Many were used by the Swiss Post as a delivery vehicle. Today they are highly collectible.

Also in 1960, the corrugated Citroën H Van style &quot;ripple bonnet&quot; of convex swages was replaced (except for the Sahara), with one using six larger concave swages and looked similar until the end of production. The 2CV had suicide doors in front from 1948 to 1964, replaced with front hinged doors from 1965 to 1990.

In 1961, Citroën launched a new model based on the 2CV chassis, with a four-door sedan body and a reverse rake rear window: the Citroën Ami. In 1962, the engine power was increased to and top speed to . A sunroof was installed. In 1963, the engine power was increased to . An electric wiper motor replaced the drive on the speedometer. The ammeter was replaced by a charging indicator light. The speedometer was moved from the window frame into the dash. Instead of a dipstick/measuring rod, a fuel gauge was introduced.

Director of publicity Claude Puech came up with humorous and inventive marketing campaigns. Robert Delpire of the Delpire Agency was responsible for the brochures. Ad copy came from Jacques Wolgensinger Director of PR at Citroën. Wolgensinger was responsible for the youth oriented &quot;Raids&quot;, 2CV Cross, rallies, the use of &quot;Tin-Tin&quot;, and the slogan &quot;More than just a car—a way of life&quot;. A range of colours was introduced, starting with Glacier Blue in 1959, then yellow in 1960. In the 1960s, 2CV production caught up with demand. In 1966, the 2CV got a third side window, this window made them look slightly bigger in size. In February 1965, Citroën Belgium introduced the 3CV AZAM6 which featured the 602 cc, Ami 6 engine and the Ami&#x27;s improved chassis. This version was manufactured until October 1967 and was also exported to certain continental markets although it was never offered in its native France.
In 1967, Citroën launched the new &quot;Dyane&quot; model, a direct derivative, based on the 2CV chassis, with an updated but similar, utilitarian body, distinguished by a hatchback that boosted practicality; (a hatchback kit was available from Citroën dealers for the 2CV and aftermarket kits were available). This was in response to competition by the Renault 4. The exterior is more modern and distinguished by the integrated lights in the wings and bodywork. Between 1967 and 1983, about 1.4 million Dyanes were built. The Dyane was a more sophisticated 2CV and originally planned to supersede it, but 2CV production continued by its side and ultimately the 2CV outlived the Dyane by seven years. Citroën also developed the Méhari off-roader.

From 1965, the car was offered in some countries, at extra cost, with the flat-2 engine size increased to , although for many years the smaller engine continued to be available in France and export markets where engine size determined car tax levels. This was replaced by an updated engine in February 1970.

==== 1970–1979 ====

In 1970, the car gained rear light units from the Citroën Ami 6. (602 cc) models. From then on, only two series were produced: the 2CV 4 (AZKB) with 435 cc and the 2CV 6 (AZKA) with 602 cc displacement. All 2CVs from this date can run on unleaded fuel. 1970s cars featured rectangular headlights from 1975, except the Spécial model. In 1971, the front bench seat was replaced with two individual seats. In 1972, 2CVs were fitted with standard three-point seat belts. In 1973, new seat covers, a padded single-spoke steering wheel and ashtrays were introduced.

The highest annual production was in 1974. Sales of the 2CV were reinvigorated by the 1974 oil crisis. The 2CV after this time became as much a youth lifestyle statement as a basic functional form of transport. This renewed popularity was encouraged by the Citroën &quot;Raid&quot; intercontinental endurance rallies of the 1970s where customers could participate by buying a new 2CV, fitted with a &quot;P.O.&quot; kit (Pays d&#x27;Outre-mer—overseas countries), to cope with thousands of kilometres of very poor or off-road routes.

* 1970: Paris–Kabul: 1,300 young people, 500 2CVs, to Afghanistan and back.
* 1971: Paris–Persepolis: 500 2CVs to Iran and back.
* 1973: Raid Afrique, 60 2CVs from Abidjan to Tunis, the Atlantic capital of Ivory Coast through the Sahara (the Ténéré desert section was unmapped and had previously been barred to cars), to the Mediterranean capital of Tunisia.

The Paris to Persepolis rally was the most famous. The Citroën &quot;2CV Cross&quot; circuit/off-road races were very popular in Europe.

Because of new emission standards, in 1975, power was reduced from . The round headlights were replaced by square ones, still adjustable in height. A new plastic grille was fitted.

In July 1975, a base model called the 2CV Spécial was introduced with the 435 cc engine. Between 1975 and 1990 under the name of AZKB &quot;2CV Spécial&quot; a drastically reduced trim basic version was sold, at first only in yellow and with an untreated black roof. Slimmer bumpers with stick-on tape rather than plastic strips and no overriders were fitted. It also had the earlier round headlights, last fitted in 1974. In order to keep the price as low as possible, Citroën removed the third side window, the ashtray and virtually all trim from the car, while that which remained was greatly simplified, such as simple vinyl-clad door cards and exposed door catches rather than the plastic moulded trims found on the 2CV Club. Other 2CVs shared their instruments with the Dyane and H-Van but the Spécial had a much smaller square speedometer also incorporating the fuel gauge, originally fitted to the 2CV in the mid-1960s and then discontinued. The model also had a revised (and cheaper-to-make) plastic version of the 1960s two-spoke steering wheel instead of the one-spoke item from the Dyane, as found on the Club. From the 1978 Paris Motor Show the Spécial regained third side windows and was available in red and white. Beginning in mid-1979 the 602 cc engine was installed. In June 1981, the Spécial E arrived. This model had a standard centrifugal clutch and particularly low urban fuel consumption.

==== 1980–1990 ====

By 1980, the boost to 2CV sales across Europe delivered by the 1973 Energy Crisis had begun to wear off and there was a whole new generation of superminis and economy cars available from European and Japanese manufacturers. Citroën itself now had the Visa available which launched in 1978. Peak annual production for 2CVs reached 163,143 cars in 1974 but by 1980 this had dropped to 89,994 and by 1983 would stand at just 59,673. Nonetheless, the car remained profitable for PSA to produce on account of its tooling and set-up costs being amortised many years before and it could share major parts with more popular or profitable models such as the Visa and Acadiane. As part of this rationalisation in 1981, the Spécial was fitted as standard with the 602 cc engine, although the 435 cc version remained available to special order in some European countries until stocks were used up.

Also in 1981, a yellow 2CV6 was driven by James Bond (Roger Moore) in the film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;. The car in the film was fitted with the flat-4 engine from a Citroën GS which more than doubled the power. In one scene, the ultra-light 2CV tips over and is quickly righted by hand. Citroën launched a special edition 2CV &quot;007&quot; to coincide with the film, it was fitted with the standard engine and painted yellow with &quot;007&quot; on the front doors and fake bullet hole stickers.

In 1982, all 2CV models got inboard front disc brakes which also used LHM fluid instead of conventional brake fluid—the same as was found in the larger Citroën models with hydropneumatic suspension.

In late 1986, Citroën introduced the Visa&#x27;s replacement, the AX. This was widely regarded as a superior car to the Visa and took many of the remaining 2CV sales in France following its introduction. From 1986 to 1987 2CV production fell by 20 per cent to just 43,255 cars. Of that total over 12,500 went to West Germany and 7212 went to the UK. France was now the third-largest market for 2CVs, taking 7045 cars that year. It was estimated that Citroën was now selling the 2CV at a loss in the French market, but that it was still profitable in other European countries. The peak of 2CV sales in the United Kingdom would be reached in 1986, thanks to the introduction of the popular Dolly special edition (see below)—7520 new 2CVs were registered in Britain that year. This year saw the discontinuation of the Club which was by then the only 2CV model to retain the rectangular headlamps. This left the Spécial as the only regular 2CV model, alongside the more fashion-orientated Dolly, Charleston and the other special editions.

In 1988, production ended in France after 40 years. The factory at Levallois-Perret had been the global centre for 2CV production since 1948 but was outdated, inefficient and widely criticised for its poor working conditions. The last French-built 2CV was made on February 25. In recognition of the event, the last 2CV built at Levallois was a basic Spécial in a non-standard grey colour—the same shade as worn by the very first 2CVs. Production of the 2CV would continue at the smaller-capacity but more modern Mangualde plant in Portugal until 1990.

In 1989, a number of European nations voluntarily introduced the first European emission standards ahead of the legal deadline of July 1992. This forced the 2CV&#x27;s withdrawal from sale in Austria, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands, the latter one of the car&#x27;s largest remaining markets. That year, the three leading markets for the 2CV were West Germany (7866), France (5231) and the UK (3200).

The last 2CV, a specially-prepared Charleston model, was built at Mangualde on 27 July 1990. Only 42,365 2CVs were built in Portugal in the two years following the end of French production.

Portuguese-built cars, especially those from when production was winding down, have a reputation in the UK for being much less well-made and more prone to corrosion than those made in France. According to Citroën, the Portuguese plant was more up-to-date than the one in Levallois near Paris and Portuguese 2CV manufacturing was to higher-quality standards.

As of October 2016, 3,025 remained in service in the UK.

==== Special edition saloon models ====

The special edition models began with the 1976 SPOT model and continued in with the 1980 Charleston, inspired by Art-Deco two colour styles 1920s Citroën model colour schemes (initially Grey/Black, Maroon/Black and Yellow/Black). In 1981 the 007 arrived. In 1983 the 2CV Beachcomber arrived in the United Kingdom; it was known as &quot;France 3&quot; in France or &quot;Transat&quot; in other continental European markets—Citroën sponsored the French America&#x27;s Cup yacht entry of that year. In 1986 there was the Cocorico. This means &quot;cock-a-doodle-doo&quot; and tied in with France&#x27;s entry in the 1986 World Cup. &quot;Le Coq Gaulois&quot; or Gallic rooster is an unofficial national symbol of France. In 1987 came the Bamboo, followed by the 1988 Perrier in association with the mineral water company.

The Charleston, having been presented in October 1980 as a one-season &quot;special edition&quot; was incorporated into the regular range in July 1981 in response to its &quot;extraordinary success&quot;. By changing the carburetor to achieve , a top speed of was achieved. Other changes were a new rear-view mirror and inboard disc brakes at the front wheels.

The Dolly special edition was introduced in March 1985, using bright two-tone colour schemes with a similar Art Deco style as the more subdued Charleston. In its name, style and marketing the Dolly was particularly aimed at female car buyers, as in the mid-1980s research showed that 40% of 2CV buyers were women. The original colour combinations offered were grey/white, grey/red and grey/yellow. All these cars were quickly sold out, so a second series of Dolly models were produced in September in white/red, white/green and beige/maroon. With demand for these models still high Citroën made the Dolly a permanent fixture in the 2CV range. While the first two series had, like the other special editions, been based on the more luxurious Club model the production Dolly was based on the basic 2CV Spécial to provide a model priced between the Spécial and the Club. Colours offered on the Dolly from 1986 were white/red, beige/maroon and blue/beige. In many markets, including Germany and the UK, the Dolly was best-selling 2CV model, outselling all the other variants combined in some years. The Charleston continued as the range-topping model, but the yellow/black colour option was dropped from 1984. This meant that in the 1980s there was a range of four full models:

* Spécial
* Dolly (an improved version of the Spécial)
* Club (discontinued in 1987)
* Charleston (an improved version of the Club)

In Germany and Switzerland a special edition called &quot;I Fly Bleifrei&quot; (&quot;I Fly Lead Free&quot;) was launched in 1986, painted in two-tone green. The name and color were a reference to this version&#x27;s ability to use unleaded fuel instead of the then-normal leaded petrol and super unleaded. It was introduced mainly because of stricter emissions standards. In 1987 the German market received the all-green &quot;Sausss-Ente&quot; special edition (limited to 400 examples), this translates to &quot;quick duck&quot;. It continued the &quot;I Fly Bleifrei&#x27;s&quot; design theme and was decorated with a helmeted and goggled flying duck. Tongue-in-cheek, the period advertisements as well as the side graphics proudly showcased the car&#x27;s 59.4-second acceleration time.

== Export markets ==

The 2CV was originally sold in France and some European markets, and went on to enjoy strong sales in Asia, South America, and Africa. During the post-war years Citroën was very focused on the home market, which had some unusual quirks, like puissance fiscale. The management of Michelin was supportive of Citroën up to a point, and with a suspension designed to use Michelin&#x27;s new radial tyres the Citroën cars clearly demonstrated their superiority over their competitors&#x27; tyres. But they were not prepared to initiate the investment needed for the 2CV (or the Citroën DS for that matter) to truly compete on the global stage. Citroën was always under-capitalised until the 1970s Peugeot takeover. The 2CV sold 9 million vehicles; the Volkswagen Beetle, which was available worldwide, sold 21 million units.

Production of the 2CV in Belgium was from 1952 to 1980.

=== Britain ===

Production at Citroën&#x27;s plant in Slough, England was from 1953 to 1960. Until then British construction and use regulations made cars with inboard front brakes such as the 2CV illegal. Producing the car in Britain allowed Citroën to circumvent trade barriers and to sell cars in the British Empire and Commonwealth. It achieved some success in these markets, to the extent that all Slough-built 2CVs were fitted with improved air cleaners and other modifications to suit the rough conditions found in Australia and Africa, where the 2CV&#x27;s durability and good ride quality over rough roads attracted buyers. The 2CV sold poorly in Great Britain in part due to its excessive cost, because of import duties on components.

In 1959, the British Royal Navy ordered 65 2CV pick-ups from the Slough plant, following sea tests aboard HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot; in the West Indies and the Indian Ocean during 1957–58, with the Westland Whirlwind helicopters of 845 squadron RNAS. The pick-ups also served aboard HMS &quot;Albion&quot;. They were to serve as motor transport with the 42nd Commando regiment of the Royal Marines, which required robust and reliable vehicles to cope with jungle tracks, that were light enough to be taken ashore by helicopter from the aircraft carriers.

In 1959 Slough introduced a unique model, the glass-fibre coupé version called the Bijou. Styling of this car was by Peter Kirwan-Taylor (better known for his work with Colin Chapman of Lotus cars on the 1950s Lotus Elite), but the bodywork proved too heavy for the engine to endow it with adequate performance.

In 1975, the 2CV was re-introduced to the British market in the wake of the oil crisis, which resulted in an increasing demand for smaller cars, to which most manufacturers had responded by launching small &quot;supermini&quot; cars, including the Renault 5, Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Polo.

The second wave of 2CVs for the British market were produced in France but avoided the crippling import duties of the 1950s, because the UK was by then a member of the EEC. In the 1980s, the best foreign markets for the 2CV were the UK and West Germany.

=== South America ===

The 2CV was built in Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina for South America.

==== Chile ====

The 1953 Citroneta model of the 2CV made in Chile and Argentina used a type AZ chassis with 425 cc engine developing . Both chassis and engine were made in France while the &quot;three box&quot; bodywork (in both 2- and 4-door versions) was designed and produced in Chile. It was the first economy car on the market in Chile. The 1970s Chilean version mounted a 602 cc engine with an output of , and was designated as the AX-330. It was built between 1970 and 1978, during which it saw changes like different bumpers, a hard roof, front disc brakes, and square headlights.

One of the Citroën FAF models, named the &quot;Yagán&quot; after an Indigenous peoples tribe, was made in Chile between 1972 and 1973. During the Chilean coup of 1973, 200 Yagáns used by the Army to patrol the streets and the Peruvian border, with cannons.

==== Uruguay ====

From 1965, Nordex produced its own panel van and pick-up versions of the Citroën 2CV. While the doors and the rear structure (in the case of the panel van, the roof as well) were made of sheet steel, the fenders and bonnet were made by Dasur (Danrée, Soler &amp; Bonet) and were made of fiberglass-reinforced plastic. In contrast to the original, the frame was manufactured on a sheet metal bending machine. Start of production was 1966 for the &quot;3CV&quot; model and the Ami 8 model in the 1970s.

The Citroën Méhari and Ranger were produced in a Uruguayan assembly plant between 1970 and 1982. In a joint effort, Dasur made the body out of fiberglass and Nordex made the chassis, while Quintanar sold the vehicles. Around 14,000 vehicles were built, 9,000 of which were exported to Argentina and the rest remained inland.

For the Méhari, a two-cylinder boxer engine with a 74 mm bore, 70 mm stroke, 602 cc displacement and power drove the front wheels. The curb weight was 590 kg.

The Méhari Ranger represented a national specialty. With a fixed structure, the Méhari became a station wagon with large glass surfaces. The side windows in front of the doors were also striking. The rear wheel cutouts also differed from the original. This vehicle weighed 700 kg.

From 1978 onwards, Nordex manufactured the Citroën AK 400 from Argentine and Belgian parts for the Argentine market.

Another model produced was the Citroën BX, which had been exported to Brazil since 1992. The production of the Citroën ZX is documented for Nordex in 1995. In Uruguay, Citroën cars were manufactured until 2002.

==== Argentina ====

Citroën Argentina Sociedad Anónima produced 223,442 cars (all A-Series), in Argentina, from 1959 until 1979.

Model designations produced were the 2CV sedan, 3CV hatchback, AZU van, AK van, AK 400 van, AMI 8, and Méhari. The derivation called &quot;3CV&quot; was a special Argentina model with various modifications such as a hatchback.

Citroën Argentina S.A. exported parts to France, Spain, and Chile. Complete automobiles were exported to Paraguay, Bolivia and Cuba. Chassis with mechanics to Uruguay (some returned to the plant as completed Mehari or AK-400 models).

Citroën Argentina outsourced parts to 450 auto parts companies, the national content of the vehicles was over 95% by 1969.

A 2CV with a heavily modified front end called the 3CV IES America was produced well into the 1980s, by an Argentinian company that bought the rights and factory from Citroën.

=== North America ===

Only a few 2CVs were sold in North America when they were new; similar to the situation in Britain, their pricing was excessive relative to competitors. The original model that produced and had a top speed of was unsuited to the expanding post-war US freeway network, and was never widely accepted in North America. Even the fastest of the later models struggled to .

=== Yugoslavia ===

Also in 1959, the Yugoslav firm Tomos began producing the 2CV under licence at the Koper plant, in what is today Slovenia. This venture lasted from 1959 to 1985, and grew to encompass many Citroën models. The Yugoslav automobile market was closed, so this joint venture with a local firm allowed Citroën to access the market. In Yugoslavia, 2CV was famous under the nickname , and still remains better known under that name in its successor states.

=== Africa ===

In the Ivory Coast in 1963, a locally assembled 2CV was sold in some west African countries as the Citroën &quot;Baby-Brousse&quot;. This idea of building a &quot;simplified&quot; 2CV in developing countries was subsequently tried several times, as detailed under Citroën Facile à Fabriquer (easy to manufacture). One of these, the 1969 , was the first automobile manufactured in Vietnam.

In Madagascar, a former colony of France, the 2CV is so ubiquitous given its use as a taxi that is popularly considered to be a symbol of the country itself.

A home-made 2CV features in the Nigerien film &quot;Cocorico! Monsieur Poulet&quot; (1977).

=== Iran ===

In 1966, Citroën entered Iran with the 2CV. The 2CV was soon supplanted by the &quot;Jiane,&quot; a local version of the Citroën Dyane. The cars were originally manufactured in Iran in a joint venture between Citroën and Iran National up until the 1979 Revolution, when Iran National was nationalised, which continued producing the &quot;Jiane&quot; without the involvement of Citroën. SAIPA built 120,000 Jyane models.

== Production numbers ==
The Citroën factory offered several high volume variant models on the 2CV running gear – the Ami; the Dyane; the Acadiane; and the Méhari. Additionally, the 2CV was built in a wide variety of joint ventures, often with modified designs.

The 2CV and all its variants are collectively known as the &quot;A-Series.&quot;

== Construction ==

The level of technology in the 1948 2CV was remarkable for the era. While colours and detail specifications were modified in the ensuing 42 years, the biggest mechanical change was the addition of front disc brakes (by then already fitted for several years in the mechanically similar Citroën Dyane 6) in October 1981 (for the 1982 model year). The reliability of the car was enhanced by the minimalist simplification of the designers, being air-cooled (with an oil cooler), it had no coolant, radiator, water pump or thermostat. It had no distributor either, just a contact breaker system. Except for the brakes, there were no hydraulic parts on original models; damping was by tuned mass dampers and friction dampers.

The 1948 car featured radial tyres, which had just been commercialised; front-wheel drive; rack and pinion steering mounted inside the front suspension cross-tube, away from a frontal impact; rear fender skirts (the suspension design allowed wheel changes without removing the skirts); bolt-on detachable front and rear wings; detachable doors, bonnet (and boot lid after 1960), by &quot;slide out&quot; P-profile sheet metal hinges; flap-up windows, as roll up windows were considered too heavy and expensive.; and detachable full length fabric sunroof and boot lid, for almost pickup-like load-carrying versatility. Ventilation in addition to the sunroof and front flap windows was provided by an opening flap under the windscreen. The car had load adjustable headlights and a heater (heaters were standardised on British economy cars in the 1960s).

=== Body ===

The body was constructed of a dual H-frame platform chassis and aircraft-style tube framework, and a very thin steel shell that was bolted to the chassis. Because the original design brief called for a low speed car, little or no attention was paid to aerodynamics; the body had a , high by today&#x27;s standards but typical for the era.

The 2CV used the fixed-profile convertible, where the doors and upper side elements of its bodywork remain fixed although, the doors could be removed easily too by lifting them up and way from the car. The bonnet too could be removed by sliding sideways to allow extra ventilation on very hot days. The fabric soft top can be rolled back and a picnic basket was available for purchase and fixed on the boot door. This reduces weight and lowers the centre of gravity, and allows the carrying of long or irregularly shaped items, but the key reason was that fabric was cheaper than steel which was in short supply and expensive after the war. The fixed-profile concept was quite popular in this period.

=== Suspension ===

The suspension of the 2CV was very soft; a person could easily rock the car side to side dramatically. The swinging arm, fore-aft linked&lt;ref name=&quot;citroenet/2cv/1949&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; suspension system with inboard front brakes had a much smaller unsprung mass than existing coil spring or leaf spring designs. The design was modified by Marcel Chinon.

The system comprises two suspension cylinders mounted horizontally on each side of the platform chassis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Julian-Edgar/2CV-suspension&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the cylinders are two springs, one for each wheel, mounted at each end of the cylinder.&lt;ref name=&quot;citroenet/abandoned&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The springs are connected to the front leading swinging arm and rear trailing swinging arm, that act like bellcranks by pull rods (tie rods).&lt;ref name=&quot;silodrome/2cv-history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These are connected to spring seating cups in the middle of the cylinder, each spring being compressed independently, against the ends of the cylinder. Each cylinder is mounted using an additional set of springs, originally made from steel, called &quot;volute&quot; springs, on later models made from rubber. These allow the front and rear suspension to interconnect. When the front wheel is deflected up over a bump, the front pull rod compresses the front spring inside the cylinder, against the front of the cylinder. This also compresses the front volute spring pulling the whole cylinder forwards. That action pulls the rear wheel down on the same side via the rear spring assembly and pull rod. When the rear wheel meets that bump a moment later, it does the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. When both springs are compressed on one side when travelling around a bend, or front and rear wheels hit bumps simultaneously, the equal and opposite forces applied to the front and rear spring assemblies reduce the interconnection. It reduces pitching, which is a particular problem of soft car suspension.

The swinging arms are mounted with large bearings to &quot;cross tubes&quot; that run side to side across the chassis; combined with the effects of all-independent soft springing and excellent damping, keeps the road wheels in contact with the road surface and parallel to each other across the axles at high angles of body roll. A larger than conventional steering castor angle, ensures that the front wheels are closer to vertical than the rears, when cornering hard with a lot of body roll. The soft springing, long suspension travel and the use of leading and trailing arms means that as the body rolls during cornering the wheelbase on the outside of the corner increases while the wheelbase on the inside of the corner decreases. As the cornering forces put more of the car&#x27;s weight on the outside pair of wheels the wheelbase extends in proportion, keeping the car&#x27;s weight balance and centre of grip constant, promoting excellent road holding. The other key factor in the quality of its road holding is the very low and forward centre of gravity, provided by the position of the engine and transmission.

The suspension also automatically accommodates differing payloads in the car- with four people and cargo on board the wheelbase increases by around 4 cm (2 in) as the suspension deflects, and the castor angle of the front wheels increases by as much as 8 degrees thus ensuring that ride quality, handling and road holding are almost unaffected by the additional weight. On early cars friction dampers (like a dry version of a multi-plate clutch design) were fitted at the mountings of the front and rear swinging arms to the cross-tubes. Because the rear brakes were outboard, they had extra tuned mass dampers to damp wheel bounce from the extra unsprung mass. Later models had tuned mass dampers (&quot;batteurs&quot;) at the front (because the leading arm had more inertia and &quot;bump/thump&quot; than the trailing arm), with hydraulic telescopic dampers / shock absorbers front and rear. The uprated hydraulic damping obviated the need for the rear inertia dampers. It was designed to be a comfortable ride by matching the frequencies encountered in human bipedal motion.

This suspension design ensured the road wheels followed ground contours underneath them closely, while insulating the vehicle from shocks, enabling the 2CV to be driven over a ploughed field without breaking any eggs, as its design brief required. More importantly it could comfortably and safely drive at reasonable speed, along the ill-maintained and war-damaged post-war French Routes Nationales. It was commonly driven &quot;Pied au Plancher&quot;—&quot;foot to the floor&quot; by their peasant owners.

=== Front-wheel drive and gearbox ===

Citroën had developed expertise with front-wheel drive due to the pioneering Traction Avant, which was the first mass-produced steel monocoque front-wheel-drive car in the world. The 2CV was originally equipped with a sliding splined joint, and twin Hookes type universal joints on its driveshafts; later models used constant velocity joints and a sliding splined joint.

The gearbox was a four-speed manual transmission, an advanced feature on an inexpensive car at the time. The gear stick came horizontally out of the dashboard with the handle curved upwards. It had a strange shift pattern: the first was back on the left, the second and third were inline, and the fourth (or the S) could be engaged only by turning the lever to the right from the third. Reverse was opposite first. The idea was to put the most used gears opposite each other—for parking, first and reverse; for normal driving, second and third. This layout was adopted from the H-van&#x27;s three-speed gearbox. Later models had an option for a semi-automatic clutch that allow the user to engage the first gear and wait at the traffic lights with the foot on the brakes only.

=== Other ===

The windscreen wipers were powered by a purely mechanical system: a cable connected to the transmission; to reduce cost, this cable also powered the speedometer. The wipers&#x27; speed was therefore dependent on car speed. When the car was stationary, the wipers were not powered; thus, a handle under the speedometer allowed them to be operated by hand. The wipers and speedometer could not be used at the same time. From 1962, the wipers were powered by a single-speed electric motor. The car came with only a speedometer and an ammeter.

The 2CV design predates the invention of disc brake, so 1948–1981 cars have drum brakes on all four wheels. In October 1981, front disc brakes were fitted. Disc brake cars use green LHM fluid – a mineral oil – which is not compatible with standard glycol brake fluid. The disc brakes were forced-air cooled by ducts drawing air from the engine fan housing, greatly reducing the likelihood of the brakes to overheat or fade in heavy use – especially during long descents in hot summer conditions in the Alps and other mountain regions.

== Engines ==


The engine was designed by Walter Becchia and Lucien Gerard, with a nod to the classic BMW boxer motorcycle engine. It was an air-cooled, flat-twin, four-stroke, 375 cc engine with pushrod operated overhead valves and a hemispherical combustion chamber. The earliest model developed . A 425 cc engine was introduced in 1955 with initially , later increased to , followed in 1970 by a 602 cc one giving at 7000 rpm. With the 602 cc engine, the tax classification was bumped into the 3CV category, but the name remained unchanged. A 435 cc engine was introduced at the same time to replace the 425 cc unit; the 435 cc engine car was named 2CV 4 while the 602 cc took the name 2CV 6 (a variant in Argentina took the name 3CV). The 602 cc engine evolved to the M28 with in 1970; this was the most powerful engine fitted to the 2CV. A new 602 cc giving at a slower 5,750 rpm was introduced in 1979, being the final version. This engine was less powerful, and more efficient, allowing lower fuel consumption and better top speed, at the price of decreased acceleration. All 2CVs with the M28 engine can run on unleaded petrol.

The 2CV used the wasted spark ignition system for simplicity and reliability and had only speed-controlled ignition timing, no vacuum advance taking account of engine load. The inlet and exhaust manifolds were welded together into a single unit, with exhaust pipe and inlet tract abutting each other directly under the carburettor at an enlarged &#x27;heat chamber&#x27;. Heat from the exhaust warmed both the metal and the air/fuel mixture inside the chamber, ensuring full vaporization of the fuel for greater combustion efficiency. The chamber also served as a reservoir of fuel/air mixture downstream of the carburettor body, allowing each cylinder to draw an equal and balanced amount of mixture for further efficiency and smooth-running. The heat chamber principle was especially suitable for an engine running at Wide open throttle and heavy loads for long periods of time, as was intended for the 2CV, when the throttle plate in the carburettor would be fully open, the Manifold vacuum would be low and the exhaust temperatures would be high.

Unlike other air-cooled cars (such as the Volkswagen Beetle and the Fiat 500) the 2CV&#x27;s engine had no thermostat valve in its oil system. The engine needed more time for oil to reach normal operating temperature in cold weather. All the oil passed through an oil cooler behind the fan and received the full cooling effect regardless of the ambient temperature. This removes the risk of overheating from a jammed thermostat that can afflict water- and air-cooled engines and the engine can withstand many hours of running under heavy load at high engine speeds even in hot weather. To prevent the engine running cool in cold weather (and to improve the output of the cabin heater) all 2CVs were supplied with a grille blind (canvas on early cars and a clip-on plastic item called a &quot;muff&quot; in the owner&#x27;s handbook, on later ones) which blocked around half the aperture to reduce the flow of air to the engine. Like many other air-cooled car engines, the 2CV&#x27;s oil sump was wide and shallow, being formed from extensions to the crankcase castings in the form of an inverted &#x27;T&#x27;. The exterior of the sump was formed with cooling fins and the underside protruded below the level of the chassis rails, exposing the sump to the flow of air as the car drove along. The shape of the sump ensured that as much of the oil within as possible lay close to the cooled metal on the underside, further helping to regulate the oil temperature. As with the oil cooler, this cooling effect was unregulated and varied greatly depending on air temperature, vehicle speed and engine load.

The engine&#x27;s design concentrated on the reduction of moving parts. The cooling fan and dynamo were built integrally with the one-piece crankshaft, removing the need for drive belts. The use of gaskets, seen as another potential weak point for failure and leaks, was also kept to a minimum. The cylinder heads are mated to the cylinder barrels by lapped joints with extremely fine tolerances, as are the two halves of the crankcase and other surface-to-surface joints.

As well as the close tolerances between parts, the engine&#x27;s lack of gaskets was made possible by a unique crankcase ventilation system. On any 2-cylinder boxer engine such as the 2CV&#x27;s, the volume of the crankcase reduces by the cubic capacity of the engine when the pistons move together. This, combined with the inevitable small amount of &quot;leakage&quot; of combustion gases past the pistons leads to a positive pressure in the crankcase which must be removed in the interests of engine efficiency and to prevent oil and gas leaks. The 2CV&#x27;s engine has a combined engine &quot;breather&quot; and oil filler assembly which contains a series of rubber reed valves. These allow positive pressure to escape the crankcase (to the engine air intake to be recirculated) but close when the pressure in the crankcase drops as the pistons move apart. Because gases are expelled but not admitted this creates a slight vacuum in the crankcase so that any weak joint or failed seal causes air to be sucked in rather than allowing oil to leak out.

As well as features intended for durability and efficiency, the early 2CV engines were also significantly under-tuned, making much less power than was theoretically possible. The original 375 cc engine featured deliberately small-diameter inlet tracts and a small-diameter carburettor with conservative fuel jet sizes. This restricted both the engine&#x27;s power output and its maximum rotational speed to far below the actual limits of its component parts, ensuring that however hard it was driven and despite extremes of temperature, it would not be close to its ultimate limits. The 375 cc engine produced its at 3500rpm and peak torque at 2000rpm. Many of the improvements in power output made to the 2CV engine over its production life were merely the result of removing the original in-built restrictions with more efficient carburettors, manifolds and valve events. The power peak speed was raised to 4200rpm for the 425cc engine from 1955, 4500rpm from 1962 and 5000 rpm - with - from 1963. The new 602 cc and 435 cc engines introduced in 1970 made their power at 6750rpm - nearly double the speed of the original engine from 1948 but with very few changes to the engine&#x27;s internal design or components. If the original 375 cc engine had the same power density as the original 602 cc version it would have produced , more than double its actual rated output. The original principle of deliberately restricting the engine&#x27;s speed returned in 1979 for the revised M28 602 cc engine, which had its carburettor and camshaft altered to make reduced power at a lower speed of 5750rpm in the interests of lower overall fuel consumption and better torque delivery. Even the most highly-tuned factory versions of the 2CV engine do not come close to the unit&#x27;s actual upper limits - 2CVs used in the car&#x27;s racing series use standard engines tuned to around which still prove reliable even in long 24-hour endurance competitions.

These design features made the 2CV engine highly reliable; test engines were run at full speed for 1000 hours at a time, equivalent to driving at full throttle. They also meant that the engine was &quot;sealed for life&quot;—for example, replacing the big-end bearings required specialised equipment to dismantle and reassemble the built-up crankshaft, and as this was often not available the entire crankshaft had to be replaced. The engine is very under-stressed and long-lived, so this is not a major issue.

If the starter motor or battery failed, the 2CV had the option of hand-cranking, the jack handle serving as starting handle through dogs on the front of the crankshaft at the centre of the fan. This feature, once universal on cars and still common in 1948 when the 2CV was introduced, was kept until the end of production in 1990.

== Performance ==

In relation to the 2CV&#x27;s performance and acceleration, it was joked that it went &quot;from 0–60 km/h in one day&quot;. The original 1948 model that produced had a time of 42.4 seconds and a top speed of , far below the speeds necessary for North American highways or the German Autobahns of the day. The top speed increased with engine size to in 1955, in 1962, in 1970, and in 1981.

The last evolution of the 2CV engine was the Citroën Visa flat-twin, a 652 cc featuring electronic ignition. Citroën never sold this engine in the 2CV, but some enthusiasts have converted their 2CVs to 652 engines, or even transplanted Citroën GS or GSA flat-four engines and gearboxes.

In the mid-1980s &quot;Car&quot; magazine editor Steve Cropley ran and reported on a turbocharged 602 cc 2CV that was developed by engineer Richard Wilsher.

== End of production ==

The 2CV was produced for 42 years, the model finally succumbing to customer demands for speed, in which this ancient design had fallen significantly behind modern cars, and safety. Although the front of the chassis was designed to fold up, to form a crumple zone according to a 1984 Citroën brochure, in common with other small cars of its era its crashworthiness was very poor by modern standards. (The drive for improved safety in Europe happened from the 1990s onwards, and accelerated with the 1997 advent of Euro NCAP.) Its advanced underlying engineering was ignored or misunderstood by the public, being clothed in an anachronistic body. It was the butt of many a joke, famously by Jasper Carrott in the UK (&quot;if a Citroen 2CV hit a rabbit, the car would be a write-off, while the rabbit would probably think something was stuck in its ear&quot;, &quot;only the French could make a car like that and then sell it to the British&quot;, &quot;an upturned corrugated crab on wheels&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.bl.uk/tin-snail&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Citroën had attempted to replace the ultra-utilitarian 2CV several times (with the Dyane, Visa, and the AX). Its comically antiquated appearance became an advantage to the car, and it became a niche product which sold because it was different from anything else on sale. Because of its down-to-earth economy car style, it became popular with people who wanted to distance themselves from mainstream consumerism—&quot;hippies&quot;—and also with environmentalists.

Although not a replacement for the 2CV, the AX supermini, a conventional urban runabout, unremarkable apart from its exceptional lightness, seemed to address the car makers&#x27; requirements at the entry level in the early 1990s. Officially, the last 2CV, a Charleston, which was reserved for Mangualde&#x27;s plant manager, rolled off the Portuguese production line on 27 July 1990, although five additional 2CV Spécials were produced afterwards.

The 2CV was outlived by contemporaries such as the Mini (1959 – 2000), Volkswagen Beetle (1939 – 2003), Renault 4 (1961 – 1992), Volkswagen Type 2 (1949 – 2013), Fiat 126 (1972 – 2000) and Hindustan Ambassador (1957 – 2014).

== Continued popularity ==
The Chrysler CCV or Composite Concept Vehicle developed in the mid-1990s is a concept car designed to illustrate new manufacturing methods suitable for developing countries. The car is a tall, roomy four-door sedan of small dimensions. The designers at Chrysler said they were inspired to create a modernised 2CV.

The company Sorevie of Lodève was building 2CVs until 2002. The cars were built from scratch using mostly new parts. But as the 2CV no longer complied with safety regulations, the cars were sold as second-hand cars using chassis and engine numbers from old 2CVs.

The long-running 2CV circuit racing series organized by The Classic 2CV Racing Club continues to be popular in the UK.

Some English nicknames include &quot;Flying Dustbin&quot;, &quot;Tin Snail&quot;, &quot;Dolly&quot;, and &quot;Tortoise&quot;.

== Other variants ==

Several lower volume variants were produced.

=== &quot;Sahara&quot; four-wheel drive ===

One novel model was the 2CV Sahara, a four-wheel drive (4×4) car, equipped with two engines of each, each one having a separate fuel tank, two gearboxes, and a connecting rod&lt;ref name=&quot;topgear/everything-2cv&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; between the gearboxes. One was mounted in the front driving the front wheels and one in the back driving the rear wheels. A single gearstick, clutch pedal and accelerator were connected to both engines. It was originally intended for use by the French colonies in Northern Africa. As well as a decreased chance of being stranded, it provided four-wheel-drive traction with continuous drive to some wheels while others were slipping because the engine transmissions were uncoupled. Therefore, it became popular with off-road enthusiasts. Between 1958 and 1971, Citroën built 694 Saharas. The top speed was on one engine, and with both engines running. These rare vehicles are highly collectible.

The Méhari was also built as a 4×4 from May 1979, but with only one engine and a reduction gear.

=== Bijou ===
The Bijou was built at the Citroën factory in Slough, UK in the early 1960s. It was a two-door fibreglass-bodied version of the 2CV designed by Peter Kirwan-Taylor, who had been involved in styling the original 1950s Lotus Elite. The design was thought to be more acceptable in appearance to British consumers than the standard 2CV. Incorporating some components from the DS (most noticeably the single-spoke steering wheel, and windscreen for the rear window), it did not achieve market success, because it was heavier than the 2CV and still used the 425 cc engine and so was even slower, reaching only under favourable conditions. It was also more expensive than the Austin Mini, which was more practical. 212 were built.

=== Complete knock down (CKD) locally built cars ===
The Greek market Citroën Pony and African market Citroën FAF and Baby-Brousse were flat-panelled Mehari type, 2CV based utility cars, built from kits of mechanical parts, with many components sourced locally. They were built in low technology assembly plants. There was widespread production of similar 2CV-based vehicles in a large number of countries, including Iran (Baby-Brousse, Jyane-Mehari), Vietnam (Dalat), Chile (Yagan), Belgium (VanClee), Spain, Portugal and others.

=== Citroën Coccinelle project ===

The Citroën Prototype C was a range of experimental non-production vehicles created by Citroën from 1955 to 1956 under the direction of André Lefèbvre. The idea was to produce a water drop-shaped, very lightweight vehicle, which would be more modern and smaller than the 2CV. One of the prototypes, the Citroën C-10 has survived and is still owned by Citroën. The overall look of the vehicle was quite similar to the Messerschmitt bubble car. It was equipped with the same 425 cc engine as the 2CV. The vehicle was also nicknamed Citroën Coccinelle (&quot;Ladybug&quot; or &quot;Ladybird&quot; in French).

=== Fourgonnette ===

The 2CV-based delivery vans introduced in the spring of 1951 differed from the sedan from the B-pillar onwards by having a box-like, spacious cargo area that could be loaded through two gullwing doors at the rear. The van was named &quot;Fourgonnette&quot; by Citroën.

In France and Switzerland, these vehicles were often to be found at the post office and small businesses, while in Germany the possibility of acquiring a mobile home at a reasonable price was the decisive factor for buyers. Technically, this variant went through almost the same development steps as the sedan.

Production of the delivery van, also known as the &quot;box duck&quot;, was discontinued in mid-1978. At about the same time, the high-roof variant of the Dyane, the Acadiane, took its place.

=== Non-factory ===

==== 4x4 ====

Various 4×4 conversions were built by independent constructors, such as Marc Voisin, near Grenoble, some from a Méhari 4×4 chassis and a 2CV body. In the UK, Louis Barbour builds single-engined four-wheel-drive 2CVs. In the late 1990s, Kate Humble from BBC Top Gear tested one against a Land Rover Defender off-road. The 2CV won.

Another very different double front-ended, four-wheel drive (but not at the same time) 2CV, the 1952 Citroën Cogolin, also known as the &quot;Bicéphale&quot;, was built for the French Fire Service—the Sapeur-Pompiers. This was meant to enable the car to drive into a narrow position and away again without having to turn.

==== Boot extensions ====

Some owners wished to have more luggage capacity in the 2CV sedan. Early 2CV could be fitted with a rounded aftermarket boot (trunk) lid, reminiscent of a post-war &quot;big boot&quot; Traction Avant.
Some late model owners fitted an extension to the car&#x27;s boot. This used the original boot lid and hinges, but in a horizontal position with the extension underneath.

==== Kit cars and specials ====

Examples of 2CV-based kit sports cars include the Pembleton, Blackjack Avion and the Lomax from Britain, and Burton and Patron from the Netherlands. Most are also available as three wheelers (single wheel at the rear), like an early Morgan sports car. Some have been fitted with larger air-cooled twin-cylinder motorcycle engines. The German Hoffmann 2CV is a two door convertible.

For transportation purposes, some saloon models were rebuilt into vans using fibreglass reconstructions of corrugated 2CV Fourgonnette rear box sections. The &quot;Bedouin&quot; was a flat-panel wooden-bodied kit car.

==== UMAP coupé ====

The small French company UMAP was established in 1956 in the northern French village of Bernon, (Aube) by Camille Martin, the former mayor. The acronym UMAP stands for Usine Moderne d&#x27;Applications Plastiques (Factory for Modern Plastic Applications). UMAP produced the SM 425 and SM 500 from 1957, two externally identical coupés based on the Citroën 2CV. In 1958 production was discontinued.

<doc id="85082" wikidata="Q6565143" url="?curid=85082" title="List of games that Buddha would not play">
<text>The Buddhist games list is a list of games that Gautama Buddha is reputed to have said that he would not play and that his disciples should likewise not play, because he believed them to be a &#x27;cause for negligence&#x27;. This list dates from the 6th or 5th century BC and is the earliest known list of games.

There is some debate about the translation of some of the games mentioned, and the list given here is based on the translation by T. W. Rhys Davids of the &quot;Brahmajāla Sutta&quot; and is in the same order given in the original. The list is duplicated in a number of other early Buddhist texts, including the &quot;Vinaya Pitaka&quot;.

# Games on boards with 8 or 10 rows. This is thought to refer to &quot;ashtapada&quot; and &quot;dasapada&quot; respectively; however, later Sinhala commentaries refer to these boards also being used with games involving dice.
# The same games played on imaginary boards. &quot;Akasam astapadam&quot; was an &quot;ashtapada&quot; variant played with no board, literally &quot;astapadam played in the sky&quot;. A correspondent in the &quot;American Chess Bulletin&quot; identifies this as likely the earliest literary mention of a blindfold chess variant.
# Games of marking diagrams on the floor such that the player can only walk on certain places. This is described in the &quot;Vinaya Pitaka&quot; as &quot;having drawn a circle with various lines on the ground, there they play avoiding the line to be avoided&quot;. Rhys Davids suggests that it may refer to &quot;parihāra-patham&quot;, a form of hop-scotch.
# Games where players either remove pieces from a pile or add pieces to it, with the loser being the one who causes the heap to shake (similar to the modern game pick-up sticks).
# Games of throwing dice.
# Dipping the hand with the fingers stretched out in lac, or red dye, or flour-water, and striking the wet hand on the ground or on a wall, calling out &quot;What shall it be?&quot; and showing the form required—elephants, horses, .
# Ball games.
# Blowing through a &quot;pat-kulal&quot;, a toy pipe made of leaves.
# Ploughing with a toy plough.
# Playing with toy windmills made from palm leaves.
# Playing with toy measures made from palm leaves.
# Playing with toy carts.
# Playing with toy bows.
# Guessing at letters traced with the finger in the air or on a friend&#x27;s back. (letters in the Brahmi script)
# Guessing a friend&#x27;s thoughts.
# Imitating deformities.
# Playing with someone&#x27;s ears, eyes or nose

Although the modern game of chess had not been invented at the time the list was made, earlier chess-like games such as &quot;chaturaji&quot; may have existed. H. J. R. Murray refers to Rhys Davids&#x27; 1899 translation, noting that the 8×8 board game is most likely &quot;ashtapada&quot; while the 10×10 game is &quot;dasapada&quot;. He states that both are race games.

== Occurrences in the Pali Canon ==
The complete list is repeated several times in the Digha Nikaya as part of a passage called &#x27;The Intermediate Section on Moral Discipline&#x27; that details ways in which the Buddha and his followers differ in their practices from brahmins and other ascetics.

* Brahmajāla Sutta (DN 1)
* Sāmaññaphala Sutta (DN 2)
* Ambaṭṭha Sutta (DN 3)
* Soṇadaṇḍa Sutta (DN 4)
* Kūṭadanta Sutta (DN 5)
* Mahāli Sutta (DN 6)
* Jāliya Sutta (DN 7)
* Mahāsīhanāda Sutta (DN 8)
* Subha Sutta (DN 10)
* Kevaṭṭa Sutta (DN 11)
* Tevijja Sutta (DN 13)

The full list also occurs twice in the Vinaya Pitaka: once in the Suttavibhanga as part of the criteria for a rule entailing suspension, and once in the Cullavaga as part of a technical discussion regarding the procedure for banishing monks from an area.

An abbreviated version also occurs in at least two other sutras: the Upāli Sutta in the Anguttara Nikaya and the Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhaya Sutta in the Majjhima Nikaya.

<doc id="85099" wikidata="Q2714" url="?curid=85099" title="Watford F.C.">
<text>Watford Football Club is a professional football club based in Watford, Hertfordshire, England. The club competes in the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football.

The team played at several grounds in their early history, including what is now West Herts Sports Club, before moving to Vicarage Road in 1922. They have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Luton Town.

Graham Taylor&#x27;s tenure as manager at the club between 1977 and 1987 saw Watford rise from the fourth tier to the first. The team finished second in the First Division in 1982–83, competed in the UEFA Cup in 1983–84, and reached the 1984 FA Cup final. Watford declined between 1987 and 1997, before Taylor returned as manager, leading the team to successive promotions from the renamed Second Division to the Premier League for one season in 1999–2000. The club played again in the highest tier in 2006–07 under Aidy Boothroyd&#x27;s management, and then again from 2015 to 2020, reaching the 2019 FA Cup final, their second FA Cup final, but losing to a record-equalling 6–0 score line. In April 2021, Watford were promoted back into the Premier League having spent just one season in the Championship, but were relegated back to the Championship in May 2022.

==History==
===Early years===
The origins of the club can be traced back to 1881 when Watford Rovers were formed by Henry Grover, who went on to play for the club as a full back. Rovers, originally composed entirely of amateur players, held home games at several locations in the town of Watford. The team first competed in the FA Cup in the 1886–87 season, and in 1889 Watford won the County Cup for the first time. The team became the football section of &quot;West Hertfordshire Club and Ground&quot; in 1891, and consequently moved to a ground on Cassio Road. In 1893 Watford Rovers changed their name to &quot;West Herts&quot; and in 1896 they joined the Southern Football League. West Herts fortunes slumped at the start of the 1897–98 season and attendances were less than 200. They took the bold step of turning professional and their fortunes revived. Watford St. Mary&#x27;s were runners up in the Hertfordshire Senior Cup of 1894–95 and attracted crowds of 400 to 500 even when West Herts were at home. The two clubs talked of an amalgamation, which ultimately occurred on 15 April 1898. This was reported by the &quot;Watford Observer&quot; of 7 May 1898. It was agreed that the two clubs should complete their remaining fixtures for the season. The new club was named Watford Football Club.

Following relegation to the Southern League Second Division in 1903, Watford appointed its first manager – former England international and First Division top scorer John Goodall. He led Watford to promotion, and kept the team in the division until his departure in 1910. Despite financial constraints, Watford won the Southern League title in the 1914–15 season under his successor, Harry Kent. Watford held the title for five years following the suspension of the Southern League during the First World War – after finishing the 1919–20 season runners-up on goal average, the club resigned from the Southern League to join the new Football League Third Division.

From 1921–22, the third tier of The Football League consisted of two parallel sections of 22 clubs, fighting both for promotion to the Second Division and also battling to hold on to their league status. There was a re-election system in place which meant the bottom two teams in each of the two divisions had to apply for re-election to the league. Watford finished outside the top six league positions in every season between 1922 and 1934. Following Kent&#x27;s departure in 1926, they finished 21st out of 22 clubs in 1926–27, but were unanimously re-elected to the league after a ballot of clubs in the top two divisions of The Football League. By contrast, under Neil McBain and subsequently Bill Findlay, the team recorded five consecutive top six finishes between 1934–35 and 1938–39, and won the Football League Third Division South Cup in 1937. The Football League was suspended in 1939 due to the Second World War.

===Post-war era===
Football resumed in 1946, with Watford still in the Third Division South. A 23rd-placed finish in 1950–51 meant that the club had to apply for re-election to the league once more, but again teams in the First and Second Divisions unanimously voted for Watford to stay in the league. McBain returned in 1956, and the team remained in the division until 1958; the league was restructured into four national divisions for the 1958–59 season, and Watford were placed in the Fourth Division. Ron Burgess replaced McBain during that season, and in the following campaign Burgess presided over Watford&#x27;s first Football League promotion. This team included Fourth Division top scorer Cliff Holton, who scored a club record 42 league goals in the season. Holton was sold to Northampton the following year after another 34 goals, to the anger of supporters. Burgess was succeeded by Bill McGarry, who bought new players such as Charlie Livesey and Ron Saunders, and in his only season at the club led the club to what was at the time its highest ever league position: third in the Third Division. Eighteen-year-old Northern Irish goalkeeper Pat Jennings also featured under McGarry, and made his international debut despite being a Third Division player.

McGarry joined Ipswich in 1964, and was replaced by player-manager Ken Furphy, from Workington Furphy rebuilt the team around players such as Keith Eddy and Dennis Bond, but after holding Liverpool to a draw in the FA Cup and narrowly failing to win promotion in 1966–67, Bond was sold to Tottenham Hotspur for £30,000, Watford&#x27;s record transfer receipt at the time. Furphy&#x27;s rebuilding came to fruition in 1969 with the signing of Barry Endean, whose arrival marked the start of an unbeaten run after Christmas. Watford secured the Third Division title in April, at home to Plymouth Argyle. A year later Watford reached the FA Cup semi-final for the first time, defeating First Division teams Stoke City and Liverpool along the way. Hampered by a lack of funds, however, Furphy eventually joined Blackburn Rovers, to be succeeded by George Kirby. Forced to sell players to survive, Watford fell back into the Third Division in 1972. The team continued to struggle in the third tier, and despite a managerial change, Watford were relegated again in 1975.

===Elton John era===
Lifelong Watford supporter musician Elton John became club chairman in 1976. The singer declared an ambition to take the team into the First Division, and sacked Kirby&#x27;s successor Mike Keen in April 1977. When Graham Taylor was named as Keen&#x27;s successor, the club was still in the Fourth Division. Taylor achieved promotion in his first season; Watford won the Fourth Division title, recording the most wins, fewest defeats, most goals scored and fewest goals conceded of any side in the division. Promotion to the Second Division followed in 1978–79, and Ross Jenkins finished the season as the league&#x27;s top scorer with 29 goals. Watford consolidated with 18th and 9th-placed finishes over the following two seasons, and secured promotion to the First Division for the first time in 1981–82, finishing second behind rivals Luton Town.

Watford started the 1982–83 season with four league wins from the opening five fixtures; in the space of seven years, the club had climbed from bottom place in the lowest division of The Football League to top position in the highest division. Watford were unable to maintain a title challenge, but eventually finished the season second behind Liverpool, which ensured UEFA Cup qualification for the following season. Luther Blissett finished the season as the First Division top scorer, before signing for Italian Serie A side Milan for £1 million at the end of the season. An FA Cup Final appearance followed in the 1984 fixture, where they lost to Everton. After guiding Watford to a ninth-place finish in 1986–87, Taylor left the club to manage Aston Villa.

Following Taylor&#x27;s departure, Wimbledon manager Dave Bassett was appointed as his replacement, and England winger John Barnes was sold to Liverpool. After 4 wins from his opening 23 league fixtures, Bassett was sacked in January 1988. Watford were bottom of the First Division at the time of his departure, and Steve Harrison could not prevent relegation at the end of the season. In 1988–89, Harrison&#x27;s Watford failed to return to the First Division, after defeat in the Second Division play-offs. The under-18 team won the FA Youth Cup, beating Manchester City 2–1 after extra time, with future England international David James in goal for the Hornets. Harrison departed in 1990, and over the next few years, the closest Watford came to promotion was a seventh-placed finish in Division One in the 1994–95 season. However, in the following season – Glenn Roeder&#x27;s third as manager – Watford struggled. Despite the return of Graham Taylor as caretaker manager in February 1996, the club was relegated to Division Two.

Following the relegation, Taylor became director of football, with former Watford midfielder Kenny Jackett as manager. After a mid-table finish in Division Two in 1996–97, Jackett was demoted to the position of assistant manager. Taylor returned as manager, and won the Second Division title in 1997–98 – Watford&#x27;s second league title under his management. A second successive promotion followed in 1998–99, thanks to a 2–0 play-off final victory over Bolton Wanderers. Watford&#x27;s first Premiership season started with an early victory over Liverpool, but Watford&#x27;s form soon faded, and the club were relegated after finishing bottom. Graham Taylor retired at the end of the 2000–01 season, and was replaced by Gianluca Vialli. Wage bills at the club rose by £4 million during Vialli&#x27;s tenure, and the club finished 14th in the division in 2001–02. Vialli was sacked at the end of the season, following a dispute with the club&#x27;s board over the wage bill. He was replaced by Ray Lewington, who had joined the club the previous summer as Vialli&#x27;s reserve team manager.

===Financial struggles===

Watford&#x27;s weak financial position was exposed in 2002–03, following the collapse of ITV Digital. The club was facing administration, but an agreement by players and staff to a 12% wage deferral helped the club&#x27;s cash flow, and a run to the FA Cup semi-final generated vital revenue. Financial constraints saw a large number of players released that summer. After consolidating in 2003–04, the following season started well, with the club in the upper half of the Championship at the end of September. Poor form, however, saw the club drop towards the relegation zone. Despite reaching the semi-final of the League Cup, Watford&#x27;s league form did not improve, and Lewington was sacked in March 2005. His successor, Aidy Boothroyd, led the club to Championship survival.

===Return to the Premier League===
Watford finished third in the league in Boothroyd&#x27;s first full season, and defeated Leeds United 3–0 in the play-off final to gain promotion to the Premier League. But the team did not record a Premier League win until November, and Ashley Young was sold to Aston Villa for a club record fee of £9.65 million in January 2007. Watford finished bottom after only winning five league games, but did reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup. Boothroyd continued as manager, and spent heavily on players, including a then-club record £3.25 million for Nathan Ellington. Watford led the Championship by several points early in 2007–08, but only finished sixth; Boothroyd&#x27;s team were defeated 6–1 on aggregate by Hull City in the play-off semi-finals. Boothroyd left the club by mutual consent three months into the 2008–09 season, with Watford 21st in the Championship table.

Under Boothroyd&#x27;s successor, Brendan Rodgers, Watford finished 13th. Rodgers left to manage Reading at the end of the season; Malky Mackay, who had previously served as caretaker manager, was his replacement. Amid the departures of several key players during Mackay&#x27;s tenure, including Tommy Smith and Jay DeMerit, and the club coming close to administration, Watford finished 16th in 2009–10 and 14th the following season. Mackay left to manage Cardiff City in June 2011 and was replaced by Sean Dyche. Despite presiding over Watford&#x27;s highest league position in four years by finishing 11th, Dyche was dismissed as Watford manager in July 2012.

===Pozzo family era===
In June 2012, Laurence Bassini completed the sale of the club to the Pozzo family (Gino Pozzo and his father). Following Dyche&#x27;s sacking, the new owners brought in former Italy international Gianfranco Zola to take charge. In the 2012–13 season Watford finished third in the Championship, and reached the play-off final where they were defeated in the final by Crystal Palace 1–0 via an extra-time penalty by Kevin Phillips. The following season, Giuseppe Sannino replaced Zola, as their new manager and the team finished the season in 13th place. Sannino resigned at the start of the 2014–15 season and was replaced by Óscar García, who left shortly afterwards for &quot;health reasons&quot;.

Billy McKinlay replaced him but, despite winning 4 points out of a possible 6 under his stewardship, after just eight days he too was replaced, by Slaviša Jokanović. With Jokanović managing the team, Watford finished second in the Championship, after being edged out on the final day by champions AFC Bournemouth, and were promoted.

Watford did not renew Jokanović&#x27;s contract and he was replaced by the Spaniard Quique Sánchez Flores ahead of the 2015–16 season. Under Sánchez Flores Watford finished 13th in the Premier League, and reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, ending Arsenal&#x27;s bid to win the competition for three successive times, but were beaten 2–1 by Crystal Palace. Near the end of the season, in May 2016, Sánchez Flores and the club enacted a break clause in his contract, and he was replaced by Italian coach Walter Mazzarri who signed a three-year contract. At the end of the next season, in May 2017, Watford finished 17th and Mazzari resigned, replaced by Marco Silva. The new coach was sacked after approximately six months, following interest from Everton, in January 2018, and the club hired Javi Gracia. In April 2019 Watford came back from 2–0 down to beat Wolverhampton Wanderers to reach the FA Cup final for the second time in their history, with Gerard Deulofeu scoring twice and Troy Deeney scoring a penalty in the 94th minute to take it to extra time. They met Manchester City in the final and were defeated 6–0, a joint record margin of victory for an FA Cup Final. In the league Watford finished 11th, with 50 points, both club records for the Premier League era.

After four games of being in charge in the 2019–20 season, Gracia was sacked due to poor form in the league. 30 minutes after he was sacked, former manager Quique Sánchez Flores was again appointed. He survived only until 1 December 2019 after getting only one win since his appointment in September. A caretaker manager was appointed for one game before Nigel Pearson came into management. Watford ended Liverpool&#x27;s unbeaten run of 44 top-flight games in February 2020, but Pearson was sacked 2 games before the end of the season, and the club were relegated, finishing 19th out of 20. Watford finished the 2020–21 Championship season in second place, gaining immediate promotion back to the Premier League, but again finished the following season 19th out of 20 and were relegated back to the Championship. On June 4, 2024, the Pozzo family decided to put up 10% of the club for sale under fan ownership in order to generate cash for the club.

==Club identity==
Watford&#x27;s kit has changed considerably over the course of the club&#x27;s history. The club&#x27;s kit featured various combinations of red, green and yellow stripes, before a new colour scheme of black and white was adopted for the 1909–10 season. These colours were retained until the 1920s, when the club introduced an all-blue shirt. After a change of colours to gold shirts and black shorts for 1959–60, the team&#x27;s nickname was changed to The Hornets, after a popular vote via the supporters club. These colours remained until 1976, when Watford&#x27;s kits started featuring red, and the gold was changed to yellow. That colour scheme has continued into the 21st century.

Watford&#x27;s initial nickname was &quot;The Brewers&quot;, in reference to the Benskins Brewery, which owned the freehold of Vicarage Road. This nickname did not prove particularly popular, and upon the adoption of a blue-and-white colour scheme in the 1920s, the club became predominantly known as &quot;The Blues&quot;. When Watford changed kit colours in 1959, supporters chose &quot;The Hornets&quot; as the team&#x27;s new nickname, and the club later introduced a crest depicting a hornet. In 1974 the design was changed to depict Harry the Hornet, the club&#x27;s mascot. The club&#x27;s nickname remains, but in 1978 the hornet crest was replaced by a depiction of a hart – a male red fallow deer– on a yellow and black background. A hart represents the town&#x27;s location in the county of Hertfordshire. It has now been confirmed by the club that it was in fact a Moose on the crest and not a Hart as previously thought by Watford fans. Until Barnet and, later, Stevenage joined the Football League, Watford were Hertfordshire&#x27;s only league club. Other nicknames have since been adopted, including &quot;Yellow Army&quot; and &quot;The &#x27;Orns&quot;.

Until April 2019, when Watford played at Vicarage Road their players traditionally entered the pitch at the start of the game to the &quot;Z-Cars&quot; theme tune. However, in mid-April 2019 the team changed their entrance song to Elton John&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Still Standing&quot;. The club returned to Z Cars as the theme to welcome players to the pitch in August 2019 at the start of the 2019–20 Premier League season, following fan pressure and petitions.

==Stadium==

Watford Rovers played at several grounds in the late 19th century, including Cassiobury Park, Vicarage Meadow and Market Street, Watford. In 1890, the team moved to a site on Cassio Road, and remained there for 32 years, before moving to Watford&#x27;s current stadium at nearby Vicarage Road in 1922. The new stadium was initially owned by Benskins Brewery; the club rented the ground until 2001, when it purchased the freehold outright. However, the club&#x27;s financial situation worsened following the purchase, and in 2002 Watford sold the ground for £6 million in a deal which entitled Watford to buy the stadium back for £7 million in future. Watford took up this option in 2004 using a campaign backed and funded by the fans called &quot;Lets buy back the Vic&quot;.

Vicarage Road is a four-sided ground with a capacity of 21,577. The East Stand, part of which was constructed in 1922, was closed to the general public in 2008 for health and safety reasons, although it still hosted the dressing rooms and the matchday press area. In November 2013, the East Stand was demolished and in its place a new steel-framed, 3,500-seater stand was constructed. The stand opened fully on Boxing Day 2014 and was named The Elton John Stand after the club&#x27;s longstanding chairman. The Graham Taylor Stand (previously the Rous Stand), built in 1986, has two tiers and runs the length of the pitch, with the upper section containing the club&#x27;s corporate hospitality. At either end of the pitch, The Vicarage Road Stand is split between the club&#x27;s family section and away supporters, while the Rookery Stand is for home supporters only. Both stands were built in the 1990s, financed by proceeds from player sales. In the summer of 2015, The Elton John Stand was revamped in order to accommodate an extra 700 seats. This number was revised a day later to around 1,000 extra seats following the announcement of an expansion in the north-east corner.

Between 1997 and early 2013, Watford shared Vicarage Road with rugby union side Saracens F.C. The stadium has hosted matches for the England under-21s, and senior international football between overseas teams. Elton John has also used Vicarage Road as a venue for concerts: He first played at the stadium in 1974 and returned in 2005 and 2010 to stage fundraising concerts for the club. Former events include horse and carriage shows and greyhound racing.

The Watford Training Ground is located on the University College London Union (UCLU) Shenley Sports grounds in St Albans, Hertfordshire.

==Luton rivalry==
Watford fans maintain a rivalry with those of Luton Town. The two sides met regularly in the Southern League between 1900 and 1920, and continued to do so in The Football League until 1937, when Luton gained promotion from Division Three South. Luton remained in a higher division than Watford until 1963.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Watford and Luton met sporadically. Despite this, the rivalry grew in significance, particularly following an ill-tempered match between the sides in 1969, in which three players were sent off. Both sides won promotion to the First Division in the 1981–82 season, with Luton taking the championship ahead of Watford. They were also relegated together from the new Division 1 in 1995–96, with Watford finishing 23rd ahead of bottom-placed Luton. Watford&#x27;s promotion from Division 2 in 1997–98 meant that the two sides did not meet again until Luton won promotion to the Championship for the 2005–06 season. The only meeting between those seasons – a League Cup tie in the 2002–03 season – was marred by violence inside Vicarage Road.

On 2 January 2006, Watford won 2–1 at Kenilworth Road in the Championship, followed by a 1–1 draw between the sides, on 9 April 2006, a point that secured Watford&#x27;s place in the 2006 Championship play-offs, from which they eventually won promotion to the Premier League for the second time, beating Leeds United, 3–0, at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

Over a fourteen-season span, Watford played in a higher division than Luton (between the 2006–07 and the 2019–20 seasons), with Luton dropping out of the football league altogether for six seasons between 2009–10 and 2014–15.

The rivalry between the two clubs resumed in the 2020–21 season. On 26 September 2020, Watford won the first league match of the season between the two clubs, 1–0, at Vicarage Road. On 17 April 2021 in the reverse fixture at Kenilworth Road, Luton won, 1–0, so the spoils for the season were shared. With Watford&#x27;s promotion back to the Premier League for season 2021–22, the rivalry did not commence that year; although it resumed for the 2022–23 season after Watford&#x27;s immediate relegation from the Premier League, whilst Luton remained in the Championship. Luton were promoted to the 2023-24 Premier League, but were relegated back to the Championship after one season.

The head-to-head record between the clubs, in competitions which currently exist, stands at Luton 55 wins, Watford 38 wins, with 29 draws.

==Managers==
Watford&#x27;s team was selected by committee until 1903, when former England international John Goodall was appointed player-manager. The impact was immediate, as Watford secured promotion to the Southern League First Division in 1903–04. Goodall retired as a player in 1907, and left the club in 1910. He was replaced by his former captain, Harry Kent, who become known for his financial management of the club; under Kent, Watford frequently made a profit in the transfer market. Kent led the club to the Southern League title in 1914–15, and missed out on a second title in 1919–20 on goal average, before resigning in 1926. His three immediate successors – Fred Pagnam, Neil McBain and Bill Findlay – all played for Watford before and during the early part of their managerial tenures. None were able to lead the team to promotion from the Third Division South, although Findlay did lead Watford to a Third Division South Cup win in 1937.

Up until Findlay&#x27;s departure in 1947, Watford had been managed by five managers in 44 years, all of whom played for the team. By contrast, six men managed the club between 1947 and 1956, only two of whom were former Watford players. After a further three years under McBain between 1956 and 1959, Watford&#x27;s following three managers presided over improved teams. Ron Burgess led Watford to promotion from the Fourth Division in 1959–60. Bill McGarry was only in charge for one full season (1963–64), but Watford recorded a finish of third in the Third Division, the club&#x27;s highest Football League finish until that point. His successor Ken Furphy matched that achievement in 1966–67, and led Watford to the Third Division title in 1969, before taking the club to its first FA Cup semi-final in 1970. Following Furphy&#x27;s departure in 1971, Watford entered a period of decline, experiencing relegation under subsequent managers George Kirby and Mike Keen.

Graham Taylor took charge of Watford in 1977. He led the club to promotion to the Third Division in 1978, the Second Division in 1979, and the First Division for the first time in Watford&#x27;s history in 1982. After a second-placed finish in the First Division in 1983, Watford competed in European competition for the first time in 1983–84, as well as reaching the 1984 FA Cup final. Taylor left the club at the end of 1986–87. Under the six subsequent permanent managers (Dave Bassett, Steve Harrison, Colin Lee, Steve Perryman, Glenn Roeder and Kenny Jackett), Watford slid from 9th in the top tier in 1987, to 13th in the third tier in 1997. Taylor returned as manager for the start of the 1997–98 season. He led the club to consecutive promotions, but could not prevent relegation from the Premier League in 1999–2000. Since Taylor&#x27;s retirement in 2001, Watford have had twelve managers. Of these, Aidy Boothroyd took Watford back to the Premier League in 2006, but Watford were relegated in 2007, and Boothroyd departed in 2008.

Following Watford&#x27;s takeover by the Pozzo family, Gianfranco Zola was appointed head coach, replacing former centre back Sean Dyche in July 2012. Zola took Watford to third position in the Championship in 2012–13 but resigned on 16 December 2013. He was replaced by fellow Italian Beppe Sannino in December 2013. Sannino guided the team to a final league position of 13th.

Despite winning four of the first five league matches of the 2014–15 season, and with Watford sitting in 2nd place, Sannino&#x27;s position had become the subject of much speculation following rumours of dressing-room unrest and some players taking a dislike to his style of management. Sannino resigned from his position as head coach on 31 August 2014 after just over eight months in charge. His final game in charge was a 4–2 win at home to Huddersfield Town the day before.

Sannino&#x27;s departure initiated a bizarre sequence of events which led to Watford having three further head coaches in little more than a month. On 2 September, Watford confirmed the appointment of former Brighton &amp; Hove Albion head coach Óscar García as the successor to Sannino, beating off competition from fellow Championship side Leeds United for his services. García, however, resigned from his position on 29 September 2014 for health reasons, having been admitted to hospital with chest pains a couple of weeks prior. Billy McKinlay, who had only been appointed first team coach on 26 September 2014, was appointed as his immediate successor on the same day – his first position in management. A week later, McKinlay was released by mutual consent and former Partizan coach Slaviša Jokanović appointed in his place, apparently because the club favoured a head coach with greater experience.

On 4 June 2015, Quique Sánchez Flores was announced as the new head coach as the replacement to Jokanović, who had failed to agree contract terms. Despite going on to lead the newly promoted Watford to a comfortable mid-table position in the Premier League and the semi-final of the FA Cup, it was announced on 13 May 2016 that Sánchez Flores would be leaving the club at the end of the season.

Following Sánchez Flores&#x27;s departure, Walter Mazzarri was announced as Watford&#x27;s head coach starting on 1 July 2016.
Mazzari&#x27;s tenure as manager was terminated at the end of the season.
On 27 May 2017 Marco Silva was appointed head coach.
On 21 January 2018, Javi Gracia was appointed as head coach following Silva&#x27;s departure. Gracia has been met with widespread praise since his appointment after a successful 2018–19 Premier League campaign which saw Watford finish with their highest points tally ever in English Premier League football.

Since around 2019, the club have gained notoriety for an excessive number of managerial sackings and a lack of giving managers time, instead sacking them very quickly after a poor run of form. After a disappointing start to the 2019–20 season, Javi Gracia was sacked and replaced by previous manager Quique Sánchez Flores. Then Quique Sánchez Flores was fired again after a 2–1 loss to Southampton on 1 December. On 6 December 2019, Nigel Pearson agreed to take manager&#x27;s job, with Craig Shakespeare as his assistant, on a short-term contract to the end of the season. He was sacked on 19 July 2020 with two games to go with Hayden Mullins appointed as interim coach until the end of the season.

In the 2020–21 season, there were two more coaches, beginning with Vladimir Ivic, and followed by Xisco Munoz, who ultimately steered Watford towards promotion to the Premier League. Xisco continued to coach the team for the 2021–22 Premier League campaign until October 2021, and was subsequently followed by Claudio Ranieri from October 2021 to January 2022. Former England manager Roy Hodgson took hold of the reigns from February 2022 until the season&#x27;s end, where Watford finished in 19th place and were relegated from the Premier League.

Rob Edwards was announced as the new manager for the 2022–23 season, but was released by the club in September 2022 after 11 games in charge. Rob Edwards subsequently has gone on to have considerable success at rivals Luton Town. Slaven Bilić was announced as his replacement on an 18-month contract. Bilic was subsequently sacked on 7 March 2023 and replaced by Chris Wilder on a short-term contract until the end of the season, making it the third time in four seasons the club has had three head coaches in one season. On the 10 May 2023, French coach Valérien Ismaël was appointed head coach ahead of the 2023-24 Championship season.

==Records==
Striker Luther Blissett holds the record for Watford appearances, having played 503 matches in all competitions between 1976 and 1992, and his 415 appearances in The Football League during the same period is also a club record. Blissett holds the corresponding goalscoring records, with 186 career Watford goals, 148 of which were in the league. The records for the most league goals in a season is held by Cliff Holton, having scored 42 goals in the 1959–60 season. The highest number of goals scored by a player in a single game at a professional level is the six registered by Harry Barton against Wycombe Wanderers in September 1903.

Watford&#x27;s biggest ever competitive win came in 1900, when the team defeated Maidenhead 11–0 in the Southern League Second Division. The team&#x27;s biggest Football League winning margin is 8–0; this first occurred in a Third Division South match against Newport County in 1924, and was repeated in a First Division match against Sunderland in 1982. Both of these matches were at home – Watford have won an away league match by five goals on six occasions, most recently in the 6–1 win against Leeds United at Elland Road in 2012. The most goals scored in a Football League game involving Watford is 11, in Watford&#x27;s 7–4 victories against Swindon Town, Torquay United and Burnley in 1934, 1937 and 2003 respectively. The club&#x27;s highest home attendance is 34,099, for a fourth round FA Cup match against Manchester United on 3 February 1969. The record home league attendance is 27,968 against Queens Park Rangers in August of the same year. Watford&#x27;s home capacity has since been reduced due to all-seater requirements; it currently stands at 21,577.

<doc id="85105" wikidata="Q221839" url="?curid=85105" title="Fatima (given name)">
<text>Fatima (, ), also spelled Fatimah, is a feminine given name of Arabic origin used throughout the Muslim world. Several relatives of the Islamic prophet Muhammad had the name, including his daughter Fatima as the most famous one. The literal meaning of the name is &quot;one who separates&quot; or &quot;one who abstains&quot;. It is used in the context of &quot;separating people from Hell&quot; &quot;being separated from Hell&quot; &quot;weaning from the punishment of Hell&quot; &quot;separating good from evil&quot; or &quot;being separated from evil,&quot; so it is also considered to mean &quot;one who splits from Hell.&quot; 

The colloquial Arabic pronunciation of the name in some varieties (e.g., Levantine and Egyptian) often omits the unstressed second syllable and renders it as &quot;Fatma&quot; when romanized. Incidentally, this is also the usual Turkish form of the name (another variant, Fadime, is less common). In South Asian countries, such as India (most commonly), Pakistan, it may be spelt as Fathima. In Persian, the name is rendered as &quot;Fatemeh&quot; in the Iranian dialect, &quot;Fatima&quot; Afghan dialect, Fatimə (pronounced Fátimeh) in Azerbaijani, and &quot;Fotima&quot; (Фотима) in Tajik dialect. The name Fatima is given in honor of Prophet Muhammad’s daughter Fatima, who, in Islamic traditions, was given this name because she would save her followers from Hell.

Fatima is also used by non-Muslims: the town of Fátima, Portugal (originally named after an Arab princess) was the site of a famous Marian apparition in 1917, after which it achieved some popularity as a female personal name among Catholic populations, particularly in the Portuguese-speaking and Spanish-speaking countries.

==Variations==
This name has many variations in different languages. The Turkish and Azerbaijani transliteration of the name is either &quot;Fatma&quot; or &quot;Fatimeh&quot;. In Somali the name became &quot;Fadumo&quot;. It is &quot;Faḍma&quot; in Kabyle. In South Asia, it is spelt &quot;Fathima&quot;. Spelled as &quot;Fátima&quot;, the name is also common amongst Spanish and especially Portuguese speaking peoples in Iberia as well as in the Americas. Due to the Berber influence on Moroccan Arabic, other variations exist in Morocco, such as Fatna, Fadma, Fettoosh, Fattoom.

<text>A Marian apparition is a reported supernatural appearance by Mary the mother of Jesus, or a series of related such appearances during a period of time.

In the Catholic Church, in order for a reported appearance to be classified as a Marian apparition, the person or persons who claim to see Mary (the &quot;seers&quot;) must claim that they see her visually located in their environment. If the person claims to hear Mary but not see her, this is known as an interior locution, not an apparition. Also excluded from the category of apparitions are dreams, visions experienced in the imagination, the claimed perception of Mary in ordinarily-explainable natural phenomena, and miracles associated with Marian artwork, such as weeping statues.

Believers consider such apparitions to be real and objective interventions of divine power, rather than subjective experiences generated by the perceiving individuals, even in cases where the apparition is reportedly seen by only some, not all, of the people present at the event&#x27;s location.

Marian apparitions are considered by believers to be expressions of Mary&#x27;s ongoing motherly care for the church. The understood purpose of each apparition is to draw attention to some aspect of the Christian message, given the needs of a particular time and place. Apparitions are often accompanied by other alleged supernatural phenomena, such as medical cures. However, such miraculous events are not considered the purpose of Marian apparitions, but are alleged to exist primarily to validate and draw attention to the message.

==Examples==

Some Marian apparitions are associated with one or more titles given to Mary, often based on the location of the apparition, such as Our Lady of Pontmain in Pontmain, France (1871). Others use a title which Mary purportedly applies to herself during the alleged apparition, as in the case of the disputed apparition entitled The Lady of All Nations (Netherlands, 1945..1959).

Some Marian apparitions have only one purported seer, such as that of Our Lady of Lourdes (France, 1858). Other apparitions have multiple seers; in the case of Our Lady of Fatima (1917), there were only three seers of the apparition itself, but miraculous phenomena were reported by a crowd of approximately 70,000 people, and even by others located miles away. In other cases, the entirety of a large group of people claims to see Mary, as in the case of Our Lady of La Vang (Vietnam, ). Some modern mass apparitions, claimed to have been witnessed by hundreds of thousands, such as Our Lady of Zeitoun (Egypt, 1968~1971).

Most alleged apparitions involve the verbal communication of messages, but others are silent, such as the apparition of Our Lady of Knock (Ireland, 1879).
Some apparitions are one-time events, such as Our Lady of La Salette (France, 1846). Others recur over an extended period of time, such as Our Lady of Laus (France, 17th/18th centuries), whose seer claimed 54 years of appearances. Public, serial apparitions (in which a seer not only says that they have experienced a vision, but that they expect it will reoccur, causing people to gather to observe) appear to be a relatively recent phenomenon; up until about the seventeenth century, most reported apparitions happened when the individual was alone, or at least no one else was aware of its occurrence.

Physical contact is hardly ever reported as part of Marian apparitions. In rare cases, a physical artifact is reportedly left behind, such as the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe (Mexico, 1531), which is said to have been miraculously imprinted on the cloak of Juan Diego.

==Assessment by the Catholic Church==


The Catholic Church believes that it is possible for actually-supernatural Marian apparitions to occur, but also believes that many claimed apparitions are fabricated by the seer or the result of something other than divine intervention. For this reason, the Catholic Church has a formal evaluation process established for assessing claimed apparitions.

In 1978, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith promulgated investigation guidelines in a document entitled &quot;Norms of the Congregation for Proceeding in Judging Alleged Apparitions and Revelations&quot;, better known as , a shortening of its Latin title.

The 1978 norms were superseded by new guidelines issued by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith in May 2024. Investigations into alleged apparitions still ordinarily fall first within the jurisdiction of the local ordinary (i.e. diocesan bishop). The document recommends incidents of phenomena should be carefully assessed, to make sure that they are not fraudulent or for monetary gain.

&quot;Six possible conclusions that can be reached when discerning a possible supernatural phenomenon, ranging from a declaration that an event is not of supernatural origin to authorizing and promoting piety and devotion associated with a phenomenon without affirming its divine nature.&quot; The bishop is to submit his findings to the Dicastery for review before publishing them.

Occasionally, an ecclesial authority will decide not to investigate the veracity of an apparition in itself, but will permit religious practices related to it. Pope Leo XIII, for example, authorized the use of a scapular described in the messages of Our Lady of Pellevoisin (France, 1876), but did not pass judgment on the supernatural character of the apparition itself.

Under the new norms, a bishop or national conference will not make a declaration that these phenomena are of supernatural origin, but indicate by a &quot;nihil obstat&quot; (meaning &quot;no objection&quot;) that they find no problematic elements with a reported phenomenon. Even if a Catholic bishop sees no objection, belief in the apparition is never required of the Catholic faithful. The Catholic faith is based on so-called Public Revelation, which ended with the death of the last living Apostle. A Marian apparition, however, is considered private revelation, which may emphasize some facet of the received public revelation for a specific purpose, but can never add anything new to the deposit of faith.
In the Catholic Church, approval of a Marian apparition is relatively rare. The majority of investigated apparitions are rejected as fraudulent or otherwise false. Recently rejected apparition claims include those of &quot;Our Lady of Surbiton&quot;, denounced as fraudulent in 2007, and those associated with Holy Love Ministries in Elyria, Ohio, condemned in 2009. Some whose apparition claims are rejected have seceded from the Catholic Church as a result and initiated new groups, as in the case of the Mariavite Church, the Palmarian Catholic Church, and the Fraternité Notre-Dame.

==Cultural impact==

In many cases, apparition seers report a request from Mary for the construction of a shrine on the place of the apparition. Such Marian shrines often become popular sites of Christian pilgrimage. The most-visited Marian shrine in the world is the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, which draws 10 million pilgrims each year. Other popular apparition-related Marian pilgrimage sites include the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima in Portugal (6–8 million per year) and the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in France (1.5 million annually).

&quot;When Marian apparitions occur, Mary addresses those who see her in their native language, and often promulgates a particular image of herself that incorporates elements of the local culture.&quot; Apparitions can become a part of national identity, as Our Lady of Guadalupe is for the majority-Catholic population of Mexico, and Our Lady of Knock is for Ireland.

Apparitions often result in the establishment of Marian confraternities, movements, and societies that seek to heed and spread the messages of a particular apparition, such as the Blue Army of Our Lady of Fátima.

Occasionally, apparitions will introduce prayers that become incorporated into widespread Catholic practice, as for the case of the Fátima prayers, or the legendary revelation of the Rosary to Saint Dominic.

<doc id="85116" wikidata="Q724896" url="?curid=85116" title="Bona Dea">
<text>Bona Dea (; &#x27;Good Goddess&#x27;) was a goddess in ancient Roman religion. She was associated with chastity and fertility among married Roman women, healing, and the protection of the state and people of Rome. According to Roman literary sources, she was brought from Magna Graecia at some time during the early or middle Republic, and was given her own state cult on the Aventine Hill.

Her rites allowed women the use of strong wine and blood-sacrifice, things otherwise forbidden them by Roman tradition. Men were barred from some of her mysteries and only initiates were given the possession of her true name. Given that male authors had limited knowledge of her rites and attributes, ancient speculations about her identity abound, among them that she was an aspect of Terra, Ops, Cybele, or Ceres, or a Latin form of a Greek goddess, &quot;Damia&quot; (perhaps Demeter). Most often, she was identified as the wife, sister, or daughter of the god Faunus, thus an equivalent or aspect of the fertility nature-goddess Fauna, who could prophesy the fates of women.

The goddess had two main annual festivals. One was held at her Aventine temple, for the benefit of the Roman people; the other was hosted by the wife of a Roman senior annual magistrate for an invited group of elite matrons and female attendants. The latter festival came to scandalous prominence in 62 BC, when the politician Publius Clodius Pulcher was tried for his sacrilegious intrusion on the rites, allegedly bent on the seduction of Julius Caesar&#x27;s wife, Pompeia. Clodius was found not guilty, but Caesar divorced Pompeia because &quot;Caesar&#x27;s wife must be above suspicion&quot;. For his support of the prosecution, Cicero earned Clodius&#x27; undying hatred. The festival fertility rites remained a subject of male curiosity and speculation, both religious and prurient.

Bona Dea&#x27;s cults in the city of Rome were led by the Vestal Virgins and the Sacerdos Bonae Deae, and her provincial cults by virgin or matron priestesses. Surviving statuary shows her as a sedate Roman matron with a cornucopia and a snake. Personal dedications to her are attested among all classes, especially plebeians, freedmen and women, and slaves. Approximately one third of her dedications are from men, some of whom can be identified as acolytes and priests of her cult.

==Titles, names and origins==
&quot;Bona Dea&quot; (&quot;The Good Goddess&quot;) is a name, an honorific title and a respectful pseudonym; the goddess&#x27; true or cult name is unknown. Her other, less common names or pseudonyms include &quot;Feminea Dea&quot; (&quot;The Women&#x27;s Goddess&quot;), &quot;Laudanda ... Dea&quot; (&quot;The Goddess who must be Praised&quot;), and &quot;Sancta&quot; (&quot;The Holy One&quot;). She is a goddess of &quot;no definable type&quot;, with several origins and a range of different characteristics and functions.

Based on what little they knew of her rites and attributes, Roman historians speculated about her true name and identity. Festus describes her as identical with a &quot;women&#x27;s goddess&quot; named Damia, which Georges Dumézil sees as an ancient misreading of Greek &quot;Demeter&quot;. In the late Imperial era, the neoplatonist author Macrobius identifies her as a universal earth-goddess, an epithet of Maia, Terra, or Cybele, worshiped under the names of Ops, Fauna and Fatua. The Christian author Lactantius, claiming the late Republican polymath Varro as his source, describes her as Faunus&#x27; wife and sister, named &quot;&quot;Fenta Fauna&quot; or &quot;Fenta Fatua&quot; (Fenta &quot;the prophetess&quot; or Fenta &quot;the foolish&quot;&quot;).

==Festival and cult==

===Republican era===
The known features of Bona Dea&#x27;s cults recall those of various earth and fertility goddesses of the Graeco-Roman world, especially the Thesmophoria festival to Demeter. They included nocturnal rites conducted by predominantly or exclusively female initiates and female priestesses, music, dance and wine, and sacrifice of a sow. During the Roman Republican era, two such cults to Bona Dea were held at different times and locations in the city of Rome.

One was held on May 1 at Bona Dea&#x27;s Aventine temple. Its date connects her to Maia; its location connects her to Rome&#x27;s plebeian commoner class, whose tribunes and emergent aristocracy resisted patrician claims to rightful religious and political dominance. The festival and temple&#x27;s foundation year is uncertain – Ovid credits it to Claudia Quinta (c. late 3rd century BC). The rites are inferred as some form of mystery, concealed from the public gaze and, according to most later Roman literary sources, entirely forbidden to men. In the Republican era, Bona Dea&#x27;s Aventine festivals were probably distinctly plebeian affairs, open to all classes of women and in some limited fashion, to men. Control of her Aventine cult seems to have been contested at various times during the Mid Republican era; a dedication or rededication of the temple in 123 BC by the Vestal Virgin Licinia, with the gift of an altar, shrine and couch, was immediately annulled as unlawful by the Roman Senate; Licinia herself was later charged with inchastity, and executed. By the Late Republic era, Bona Dea&#x27;s May festival and Aventine temple could have fallen into official disuse, or official disrepute. 
The goddess also had a winter festival, attested on only two occasions (63 and 62 BC). It was held in December, at the home of a current senior annual Roman magistrate &quot;cum imperio&quot;, whether consul or praetor. It was hosted by the magistrate&#x27;s wife and attended by respectable matrons of the Roman elite. This festival is not marked on any known religious calendar, but was dedicated to the public interest and supervised by the Vestals, and therefore must be considered official. Shortly after 62 BC, Cicero describes it as one of very few lawful nocturnal festivals allowed to women, privileged to those of aristocratic class, and coeval with Rome&#x27;s earliest history.

==== Festival rites ====
The house was ritually cleansed of all unauthorized male persons. Then the magistrate&#x27;s wife and her assistants made bowers of vine-leaves, and decorated the house&#x27;s banqueting hall with &quot;all manner of growing and blooming plants&quot; except for myrtle, whose presence and naming were expressly forbidden. A banquet table was prepared, with a couch (&quot;pulvinar&quot;) for the goddess and the image of a snake. The Vestals brought Bona Dea&#x27;s cult image from her temple and laid it upon her couch, as an honoured guest. The goddess&#x27; meal was prepared: the entrails (&quot;exta&quot;) of a sow, sacrificed to her on behalf of the Roman people (&quot;pro populo Romano&quot;), and a libation of sacrificial wine. The festival continued through the night, a banquet with female musicians, fun and games (&quot;ludere&quot;), and wine; the last was euphemistically referred to as &quot;milk&quot;, and its container as a &quot;honey jar&quot;. The rites sanctified the temporary removal of customary constraints imposed on Roman women of all classes by Roman tradition, and underlined the pure and lawful sexual potency of virgins and matrons in a context that focused on female lust, instead of the lust of men. According to Cicero, any unauthorized man who caught even a glimpse of the rites could be punished by blinding, but he offers no example of this. Later Roman writers assume that apart from their different dates and locations, Bona Dea&#x27;s December and May 1 festivals were essentially the same.

===Clodius and the Bona Dea scandal===
The Winter festival rites of 62 BC were hosted by Pompeia, wife of Julius Caesar, senior magistrate in residence and pontifex maximus. Publius Clodius Pulcher, a popularist politician and ally of Caesar, was said to have intruded, dressed as a woman and intent on the hostess&#x27;s seduction. According to Plutarch, Caesar&#x27;s mother, Aurelia concealed the cult objects of the Goddess&#x27;s mysteries from the intruder; but as the rites had been vitiated, the Vestals were obliged to repeat them, and after further inquiry by the senate and pontifices, Clodius was charged with desecration, which carried a death sentence. Cicero, whose wife Terentia had hosted the previous year&#x27;s rites, testified for the prosecution.

Caesar publicly distanced himself from the affair as much as possible – and certainly from Pompeia, whom he divorced because &quot;Caesar&#x27;s wife must be above suspicion&quot;. He had been correctly absent from the rites but as a paterfamilias he was responsible for their piety. As &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, he was responsible for the ritual purity and piety of public and private religion. He had the responsibility to ensure that the Vestals had acted correctly, then chair the inquiry into what were essentially his own household affairs. Worse, the place of the alleged offense was the state property lent to every pontifex maximus for his tenure of office. It was a high-profile, much-commented case. The rites remained officially secret, but many details emerged during and after the trial, and remained permanently in the public domain. They fueled theological speculation, as in Plutarch and Macrobius: and they fed the prurient male imagination – given their innate moral weakness, what might women do when given wine and left to their own devices? Such anxieties were nothing new, and underpinned Rome&#x27;s traditional strictures against female autonomy. In the political and social turmoil of the Late Republic, Rome&#x27;s misfortunes were taken as signs of divine anger against the personal ambition, religious negligence and outright impiety of her leading politicians.

Clodius&#x27; prosecution was at least partly driven by politics. In an otherwise seemingly thorough account, Cicero makes no mention of Bona Dea&#x27;s May festival, and claims the goddess&#x27; cult as an aristocratic privilege from the first; the impeccably patrician Clodius, Cicero&#x27;s social superior by birth, is presented as an innately impious, low-class oaf, and his popularist policies as threats to Rome&#x27;s moral and religious security. After two years of legal wrangling, Clodius was acquitted – which Cicero put down to jury-fixing and other backroom dealings – but his reputation was damaged. The scandalous revelations at the trial also undermined the sacred dignity and authority of the Vestals, the festival, the goddess, office of the pontifex maximus and, by association, Caesar and Rome itself. Some fifty years later, Caesar&#x27;s heir Octavian, later the &quot;princeps&quot; Augustus, had to deal with its repercussions.

===Imperial Era===
Octavian presented himself as restorer of Rome&#x27;s traditional religion and social values, and as peacemaker between its hitherto warring factions. In 12 BC he became pontifex maximus, which gave him authority over Rome&#x27;s religious affairs, and over the Vestals, whose presence and authority he conspicuously promoted. His wife Livia was a distant relative of the long-dead but still notorious Clodius; but also related to the unfortunate Vestal Licinia, whose attempted dedication of Bona Dea&#x27;s Aventine Temple had been thwarted by the Senate. Livia restored the temple and revived its May 1 festival, perhaps drawing attention away from her disreputable kinsman and the scandalous events of 62 BC. Thereafter, Bona Dea&#x27;s December festival may have continued quietly, or could simply have lapsed, its reputation irreparably damaged. There is no evidence of its abolition. Livia&#x27;s name did not and could not appear in the official religious calendars, but Ovid&#x27;s Fasti associates her with May 1, and presents her as the ideal wife and &quot;paragon of female Roman virtue&quot;. Most of Bona Dea&#x27;s provincial and municipal sanctuaries were founded around this time, to propagate the new Imperial ideology. An imperial cult centre in Aquileia honours an Augusta Bona Dea Cereria, probably in connection with the corn dole. Other state cults to the goddess are found at Ostia and Portus. As the Vestals seldom went beyond Rome&#x27;s city boundary, these cults would have been led by leading women of local elites, whether virgin or matron.

Livia&#x27;s best efforts to restore Bona Dea&#x27;s reputation had only moderate success in some circles, where scurrilous and titillating stories of the goddess&#x27; rites continued to circulate. Well over a century after the Clodius scandal, Juvenal describes Bona Dea&#x27;s festival as an opportunity for women of all classes, most shamefully those of the upper class – and men in drag (&quot;which altars do not have their Clodius these days?&quot;) – to get drunk and cavort indiscriminately in a sexual free-for-all.

From the late 2nd century, an increasing religious syncretism in Rome&#x27;s traditional religions presents Bona Dea as one of many aspects of Virgo Caelestis, the celestial Virgin, Great Mother of the gods, whom later Mariologists identify as prototype for the Virgin Mary in Christian theology. Christian writers present Bona Dea – or rather, Fauna, whom they clearly take her to be – as an example of the immorality and absurdity at the heart of traditional Roman religion; according to them, she is no prophetess, merely &quot;foolish Fenta&quot;, daughter and wife to her incestuous father, and &quot;good&quot; &quot;(bona)&quot; only at drinking too much wine.

==Temples==

The Temple of Bona Dea in Rome was situated on a lower slope of the northeastern Aventine Hill, beneath the height known as Saxum, southeast of the Circus Maximus. Its foundation year is unknown but the Aventine was host to several foreign or imported cults. Dumezil claims that Festus&#x27; identification of Bona Dea with Damia infers a foundation date in or shortly after 272 BC, after Rome&#x27;s capture of Tarentum. On the other hand Cicero, during Clodius&#x27; trial, claimed the goddess&#x27; cult as native to Rome, coeval with its foundation. In the middle Republican era, the temple may have fallen into disrepair, or its cult into official disfavour. In 123 BC the Vestal Licinia gave the temple an altar, small shrine and couch for the goddess, but they were removed as unlawful by the pontifex maximus P. Scaevola. The temple&#x27;s use and status at the time of the Bona Dea scandal are unknown. It was restored in the Imperial era, once by the empress Livia, wife of Augustus, and perhaps again by Hadrian. It survived to at least the 4th century AD. Nothing is known of its architecture or appearance, save that unlike most Roman temples it was walled. It was an important centre of healing; it held a store of various medicinal herbs that could be dispensed at need by its priestesses. Harmless snakes roamed its precincts. Men were supposedly forbidden entry but could dedicate offerings to the goddess, or, according to Ovid, could enter the precincts &quot;if bidden by the goddess&quot;.

Most provincial sanctuaries and temples to Bona Dea are too decayed, despoiled or fragmentary to offer firm evidence of structure and layout, but the remains of four are consistent with the sparse descriptions of her Aventine temple. In each, a perimeter wall surrounds a dense compound of annexes, in which some rooms show possible use as dispensaries. The layout would have allowed the concealment of inner cults or mysteries from non-initiates. There is evidence that at least some remained in use to the 4th century AD as cultic healing centres.

==Dedications and iconography==
Despite the exclusively female, aristocratic connections claimed by Cicero for her winter festival at Rome and her high status as a protecting deity of the Roman state, elite dedications to Bona Dea are far outnumbered by the personal dedications of the Roman plebs, particularly the ingenui. The greatest number of all are from freedmen and slaves, male and female. An estimated one-third of all dedications are from men, one of whom, a provincial Greek, claims to be a priest of her cult. Others describe themselves as &quot;sacerdotes&quot;, &quot;magistri&quot; or &quot;ministri&quot; (priests and ministers) of the goddess. While almost all Roman literary sources present the exclusion of men as an official and absolute rule of her cult, this is more likely a ritualised element of her annual festival, at least in Cicero&#x27;s account of the same, than an everyday prohibition or an aspect of &quot;mystes&quot; vitiated by Clodius&#x27; unlawful presence. Inscriptions of the Imperial era show her appeal as a personal or saviour-goddess, extolled as &quot;Augusta&quot; and &quot;Domina&quot;; or as an all-goddess, titled as &quot;Regina Triumphalis&quot; (Triumphal Queen), or &quot;Terrae marisque Dominatrici&quot; (Mistress of sea and land). Private and public dedications associate her with agricultural deities such as Ceres, Silvanus, and the virgin goddess Diana. She is also named in some dedications of public works, such as the restoration of the Claudian Aqueduct.

Most inscriptions to Bona Dea are simple and unadorned but some show serpents, often paired. Cumont (1932) remarks their similarity to the serpents featured in domestic shrines (lararia) at Pompei; serpents are associated with many earth-deities, and had protective, fertilising and regenerating functions, as in the cults of Aesculapius, Demeter and Ceres. Some Romans kept live, harmless snakes as household pets, and credited them with similarly beneficial functions.

Images of the goddess show her enthroned, clad in chiton and mantle. On her left arm she holds a cornucopia, a sign of her abundant generosity and fruitfulness. In her right hand, she holds a bowl, which feeds a serpent coiled around her right arm: a sign of her healing and regenerative powers. This combination of snake and cornucopia are unique to Bona Dea. The literary record offers at least one variation on this type; Macrobius describes her cult statue as overhung by a &quot;spreading vine&quot;, and bearing a sceptre in her left hand.

== Mythology ==
Cicero makes no reference to any myth pertaining to Bona Dea. Later Roman scholars connected her to the goddess Fauna, a central figure in Latium&#x27;s aristocratic foundation myth, which was thus re-embroidered as a Roman moral fable. Several variants are known; Fauna is daughter, wife or sister of Faunus (also named &quot;Faunus Fatuus&quot;, meaning Faunus &quot;the foolish&quot;, or seer). Faunus was son of Picus, and was the first king of the Latins, empowered with the gift of prophecy. In Roman religion he was a pastoral god and protector of flocks, with a shrine and oracle on the Aventine, sometimes identified with Inuus and later, with Greek Pan. As his female counterpart, Fauna had similar gifts, domains and powers in relation to women. In Plutarch&#x27;s version of the myth, the mortal Fauna secretly gets drunk on wine, which is forbidden her. When Faunus finds out, he thrashes her with myrtle rods; in Lactantius&#x27;s version, Faunus thrashes her to death, regrets the deed and deifies her. Servius derives the names Faunus and Fauna, collectively the Fatui, from &quot;fari&quot; (to prophesy): they &quot;are also called Fatui because they utter divine prophecy in a state of stupor&quot;. Macrobius writes that Bona Dea is &quot;the same as Fauna, Ops or Fatua... It is said too that she was the daughter of Faunus, and that she resisted the amorous advances of her father who had fallen in love with her, so that he even beat her with myrtle twigs because she did not yield to his desires though she had been made drunk by him on wine. It is believed that the father changed himself into a serpent, however, and under this guise had intercourse with his daughter.&quot; This myth bears a marked similarity to the rape of Persephone, by her father Zeus in the form of a chthonic snake, in Orphic mythology. Macrobius refers the serpent&#x27;s image at the goddess&#x27; rites to this mythical transformation, and to the live, harmless serpents who roamed the goddess&#x27; temple precincts.

Varro explains the exclusion of men from Bona Dea&#x27;s cult as a consequence of her great modesty; no man but her husband had ever seen her, or heard her name. For Servius, this makes her the paragon of chaste womanhood. Most likely, once Fauna&#x27;s mythology seemed to offer an explanation for Bona Dea&#x27;s mysterious cult, the myth developed circumstantially, to fit what little was known of the practice. In turn, the cult practice may have changed to support the virtuous ideological message required of the myths, particularly during the Augustan religious reforms that identified Bona Dea with the empress Livia. Versnel (1992) notes the elements common to the Bona Dea festival, Fauna&#x27;s myths, and Greek Demeter&#x27;s Thesmophoria, as &quot;wine, myrtle, serpents and female modesty blemished&quot;.

==Cult themes in modern scholarship==
Bona Dea&#x27;s is the only known festival in which women could gather at night, drink strong, sacrificial-grade wine and perform a blood sacrifice. Although women were present at most public ceremonies and festivals, the religious authorities in Roman society were the male pontiffs and augurs, and women could not lawfully perform rites at night, unless &quot;offered for the people in proper form&quot;. Women were allowed wine at these and other religious occasions. At other times, they might drink weak, sweetened, or diluted wine in moderation but Roman traditionalists believed that in the more distant and virtuous past, this was forbidden, &quot;for fear that they might lapse into some disgraceful act. For it is only a step from the intemperance of Liber pater to the forbidden things of Venus&quot;. Some ancient sources infer that women were banned from offering blood-and-wine sacrifice in their own right; even banned from handling such materials; both claims are questionable. Nevertheless, the strong, sacrificial grade wine used in the rites to Bona Dea was normally reserved for Roman gods, and Roman men.

The unusual permissions implicit at these rites probably derived from the presence and religious authority of the Vestals. They were exceptional and revered persons; virgins, but not subject to their fathers&#x27; authority; and matrons, but independent of any husband. They held forms of privilege and authority otherwise associated only with Roman men, and were answerable only to the Senior Vestal and the Pontifex Maximus. Their ritual obligations and religious integrity were central to the well being of the Roman state and all its citizens.

The euphemistic naming of strong wine at this festival has been variously described as an actual substitution for milk and honey, relatively late in the cult&#x27;s development; as a theological absurdity; and as an ingenious justification for behaviours that would be considered unacceptable outside this specific religious sphere. Fauna&#x27;s myths illustrate the potential of wine as an agent of sexual transgression; wine was thought to be an invention of Liber-Dionysus, who was present as the male principle in certain &quot;soft fruits&quot;, including semen and grapes; and ordinary wine was produced under the divine patronage of Venus, the goddess of love and sexual desire. Its aphrodisiac effects were well known.

For Staples, the euphemisms are agents of transformation. The designation of wine as &quot;milk&quot; conceives it as an entirely female product, dissociated from the sexually and morally complex realms of Venus and Liber. Likewise, the wine jar described as a &quot;honey jar&quot; refers to bees, which in Roman lore are sexually abstinent, virtuous females who will desert an adulterous household. Myrtle, as the sign of Venus, Faunus&#x27; lust and Fauna&#x27;s unjust punishment, is simply banned; or as Versnel puts it, &quot;Wine in, Myrtle out&quot;. The vine-leaf bowers and the profusion of plants – any and all but the forbidden myrtle – transform the sophisticated, urban banqueting hall into a &quot;primitive&quot; dwelling, evoking the innocence of an ancestral golden age in which women rule themselves, without reference to men or Venus, drinking &quot;milk and honey&quot;, which are &quot;markers par excellence of utopian golden times&quot; – under the divine authority of Bona Dea.

<text>In Gallo-Roman religion, Epona was a protector of horses, ponies, donkeys, and mules. She was particularly a goddess of fertility, as shown by her attributes of a patera, cornucopia, ears of grain, and the presence of foals in some sculptures. She and her horses might also have been leaders of the soul in the after-life ride, with later literary parallels in Rhiannon of the Mabinogion. The worship of Epona, &quot;the sole Celtic divinity ultimately worshipped in Rome itself&quot;, as the patroness of cavalry, was widespread in the Roman Empire between the first and third centuries AD; this is unusual for a Celtic deity, most of whom were associated with specific localities.

==Etymology==
Although known only from Roman contexts, the name Epona (&#x27;Great Mare&#x27;) is from the Gaulish language; it is derived from the inferred Proto-Celtic *&quot;ekʷos&quot; &#x27;horse&#x27;, which gives rise to modern Welsh &quot;&quot; &#x27;foal&#x27;, together with the augmentative suffix &quot;-on&quot; frequently, although not exclusively, found in theonyms (for example Sirona, Matrona) and the usual Gaulish feminine singular &quot;-a&quot;. In an episode preserved in a remark of Pausanias, an archaic Demeter Erinys (Vengeful Demeter) too had also been a Great Mare, who was mounted by Poseidon in the form of a stallion and foaled Arion and the Daughter who was unnamed outside the Arcadian mysteries. Demeter was venerated as a mare in Lycosoura in Arcadia into historical times.

==Evidence==

Fernand Benoît found the earliest attestations of a religion of Epona in the Danubian provinces and asserted that she had been introduced in the &quot;limes&quot; of Gaul by horsemen from the east. That suggestion has not been generally taken up.
Although the name is Gaulish, dedicatory inscriptions to Epona are in Latin or, rarely, Greek. They were made not only by Celts, but also by Germans, Romans, and other inhabitants of the Roman Empire. An inscription to Epona from Mainz, Germany, identifies the dedicator as Syrian.

A long Latin inscription of the first century BC, engraved in a lead sheet and accompanying the sacrifice of a filly and the votive gift of a cauldron, was found in 1887 at Rom, Deux-Sèvres, the Roman Rauranum. Olmsted reads the inscription as invoking the goddess with an archaic profusion of epithets: &quot;Eponina&quot; &#x27;dear little Epona&#x27;, &quot;Atanta&quot; &#x27;horse-goddess&#x27;, &quot;Potia&quot; &#x27;powerful Mistress&#x27; (compare Greek &quot;Potnia&quot;), &quot;Dibonia&quot; (Latin, the &#x27;good goddess&#x27;)&quot;, &quot;Catona&quot; &#x27;of battle&#x27;, noble and good &quot;Vovesia&quot;. However, Olmsted&#x27;s interpretation has not been generally accepted by other scholars; Meid interprets the same inscription as an invocation of Dibona in vulgar Greek for aid in a romantic dispute.

Epona&#x27;s feast day in the Roman calendar was given as December 18 on a rustic calendar from Guidizzolo, Italy, although this may have been only a local celebration. She was incorporated into the imperial cult by being invoked on behalf of the Emperor, as &quot;Epona Augusta&quot; or &quot;Epona Regina&quot;.

The supposed autonomy of Celtic civilization in Gaul suffered a further setback with Fernand Benoît&#x27;s study of the funereal symbolism of the horseman with the serpent-tailed (&quot;anguiforme&quot;) daemon, which he established as a theme of victory over death, and Epona; both he found to be late manifestations of Mediterranean-influenced symbolism, which had reached Gaul through contacts with Etruria and Magna Graecia. Benoît compared the rider with most of the riders imaged around the Mediterranean shores.

Perceptions of native Celtic goddesses had changed under Roman hegemony: only the names remained the same. As Gaul was Romanized under the early Empire, Epona&#x27;s sovereign role evolved into a protector of cavalry. The cult of Epona was spread over much of the Roman Empire by the auxiliary cavalry, &quot;alae&quot;, especially the Imperial Horse Guard or &quot;equites singulares augustii&quot; recruited from Gaul, Lower Germany, and Pannonia. A series of their dedications to Epona and other Celtic, Roman, and German deities was found in Rome, at the Lateran. Her cult is said to have been &quot;widespread also in Carinthia and Styria&quot;.

As Epane she is attested in Cantabria, northern Spain, on Mount Bernorio, Palencia; as Iccona Loiminna in Portugal on the Lusitanian inscription of Cabeço das Fráguas.

A euhemeristic account of Epona&#x27;s origin occurs in the &quot;Parallela Minora&quot;, which were traditionally attributed to Plutarch (but are now classed as &quot;Pseudo-Plutarch&quot;):

Fulvius Stellus hated women and used to consort with a mare and in due time the mare gave birth to a beautiful girl and they named her Epona. She is the goddess that is concerned with the protection of horses. So Agesilaüs in the third book of his &quot;Italian History.&quot;

The tale was passed along in the context of unseemly man-beast coupling in Giambattista Della Porta&#x27;s edition of &quot;Magia naturalis&quot; (1589), a potpourri of the sensible and questionable, erroneously citing Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Solon&quot;. It may represent some recollection of Indo-European horse sacrifice, such as the Vedic &quot;ashvamedha&quot; and the Irish ritual described by Giraldus Cambrensis, both of which have to do with kingship. In the Celtic ritual, the king mates with a white mare thought to embody the goddess of sovereignty.

==Iconography==
Sculptures of Epona fall into five types, as distinguished by Benoît: riding, standing or seated before a horse, standing or seated between two horses, a tamer of horses in the manner of &quot;potnia theron&quot;, and the symbolic mare and foal. In the Equestrian type, common in Gaul, she is depicted sitting side-saddle on a horse or (rarely) lying on one; in the Imperial type (more common outside Gaul) she sits on a throne flanked by two or more horses or foals. In distant Dacia, she is represented on a stela (now at the Szépmüvézeti Museum, Budapest) in the format of Cybele, seated frontally on a throne with her hands on the necks of her paired animals: her horses are substitutions for Cybele&#x27;s lions.

==In literature and art==
Epona is mentioned in &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; by Apuleius, where an aedicular niche with her image on a pillar in a stable has been garlanded with freshly picked roses.

In his &quot;Satires&quot;, the Roman poet Juvenal also links the worship and iconography of Epona to the area of a stable. Small images of Epona have been found in Roman sites of stables and barns over a wide territory.

Epona is indirectly referenced in Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot; through the name of the character Éponine.

In &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; franchise, the main character Link&#x27;s horse is named Epona. The horse is always shown as a brown or chestnut mare with a white mane.

Artist Enya&#x27;s namesake album of 1987 contains a track titled &quot;Epona&quot;, as part of the soundtrack of the BBC documentary &quot;The Celts.&quot;

In 2017, Swiss Folk Metal band Eluveitie released a Gaulish-language song called “Epona” as part of their Evocation II: Pantheon album, praising the goddess

==In Britain==
The probable date of c. 1380–550 BC ascribed to the giant chalk horse carved into the hillside turf at Uffington, in southern England, may be too early to be directly associated with Epona and may not actually represent a horse at all. The West Country traditional hobby-horse riders parading on May Day at Padstow, Cornwall and Minehead, Somerset, which survived to the mid-20th century, despite Morris dances having been forgotten, was thought by folklorists through the 20th Century to have deep roots in the veneration of Epona, as may the British aversion to eating horsemeat. At Padstow, at the end of the festivities, the hobby-horse was formerly ritually submerged in the sea. However, there is no firm evidence of the festival before the 18th century.

A provincial, small (7.5 cm high) Roman bronze of a seated Epona, flanked by an &quot;extremely small&quot; mare and stallion, was found in England. Lying on her lap and on the patera raised in her right hand are disproportionately large ears of grain; ears of grain also protrude from the mouths of the ponies, whose heads are turned toward the goddess. On her left arm she holds a yoke, which curves up above her shoulder, an attribute unique to this bronze statuette.

In the medieval Welsh collection of stories known as the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, the regal figure of Rhiannon rides a white horse, whose slow, effortless gait supernaturally outpaces all pursuit. Wrongly accused of killing her offspring, Rhiannon has to play the role of horse for seven years as punishment, offering to carry travellers to the court and telling them her story; she also wears the work-collar of an ass. She and her son, who is fathered by the sea-god (cf Romano-Greek Poseidon, god of horses and the sea), are sometimes described as mare and foal Ronald Hutton is skeptical of connections claimed between Epona and Rhiannon; the latter is a much later, literary creation, though it also draws on oral traditions now lost. A south Welsh folk ritual called Mari Lwyd (Grey Mare) is still undertaken in December, which some folklorists likewise have held up as an apparent survival of the veneration of Epona, but again there is no firm evidence to support the age, origins or purpose of the practice.

==Today==
On Mackinac Island, Michigan, Epona is celebrated each June with stable tours, a blessing of the animals and the Epona and Barkus Parade. Mackinac Island does not permit personal automobiles; the primary source of transportation remains the horse, so celebrating Epona has special significance on this island in the upper midwest. The &quot;Feast of Epona&quot; involves the blessing of horses and other animals by a local churchman.

Epona is also worshipped today by neo-druids and other pagans and polytheists.

<text>In ancient Roman religion and myth, Caca or Cacia is the giantess sister of Cacus, the son of Vulcan who stole cattle from Hercules during the course of his western labors. Caca betrays her brother by revealing the location of the cattle to Hercules, who had in turn stolen the cattle from Geryon.

According to Lactantius and Servius, she was cultivated as a deity in recognition of her service to the god.

In his conceptual approach to Roman deity, Michael Lipka gives Cacus/Caca as one of the examples of divine pairs differentiated by gender but bound by kinship, as Libera was the sister of Liber and Fauna the daughter, sister, or wife of Faunus. Lipka suggests that these deities did not come into existence as pairs, but developed to provide complementary gender balance within their sphere of influence, in this case cattle-raising.

Despite the lateness of the only ancient sources that mention her, Caca is probably an older Roman goddess. Servius says she had a &quot;sacellum&quot; (shrine), probably located in Rome, where sacrifices were made to her through the agency of the Vestals. She has thus been seen as a sort of &quot;proto-Vesta&quot;, a fire goddess sharing in her brother&#x27;s Vulcan-inherited capacity for fire-breathing.

<text>In England, local authorities are required to adopt one of three types of executive arrangements, having an &quot;elected mayor and cabinet&quot;, a &quot;leader and cabinet&quot;, or a &quot;committee system&quot;. The type of arrangement used determines how decisions will be made within the council. In councils which use the elected mayor system, the mayor is directly elected by the electorate to provide political leadership for the council and has power to make executive decisions. In councils which use the leader and cabinet model (the most commonly used model), the elected councillors choose one of their number to be the Leader of the Council, and that person provides political leadership and can make executive decisions. Where the committee system is used, executive power is exercised through various committees rather than being focussed on one person. Many councils which use the committee system still nominate one of the councillors to hold the title &#x27;Leader of the Council&#x27;, albeit without the same powers as a leader under the leader and cabinet model.

==Historical background==
From the establishment of elected local authorities in England in the nineteenth century until the Local Government Act 2000, councils used a system of committees for decision making. There was no legislative requirement for any councillor to be declared the leader, with the principle being that all the elected councillors were equal in status. In practice, political groups had their own leaders, and when a council was under the control of a particular party, local media would commonly refer to the leader of the controlling party as being the &#x27;Leader of the Council&#x27;. It was also generally recognised that the most powerful political position on a council was the person who chaired the main policy-making committee, which in most councils was called the policy and resources committee. Usually, the leader of the largest party would chair that committee. Some councils explicitly acknowledged the existence of a leader of the council, others did not. The role of Leader of the Council in that regard was similar to that of the British prime minister; the post had not been explicitly created, but gradually emerged.

==Executive arrangement types==

The Local Government Act 2000 sought to strengthen public engagement with local democracy, and streamline the system of committees, introducing the models of directly elected mayors and cabinets, leaders and cabinets, as well as a third option for an elected mayor and council manager, which was only adopted by one authority and was later withdrawn. Additionally, lower tier authorities with a population under 85,000 were allowed to continue to use a committee system.

===Leader and cabinet===
The leader and cabinet model was introduced under the Local Government Act 2000. It consists of the leader and the cabinet itself, which is usually formed by the majority party in the local authority, where there is one, or by a coalition which comes together to elect a leader. The council elects the leader, and the leader appoints the other members of the cabinet. Each cabinet member holds a separate portfolio, such as housing, finance, economic development, or education. Decisions may be delegated to the individual members, or taken by the cabinet as a whole. These decisions are scrutinised by one or more &quot;overview and scrutiny&quot; committees, which may be dedicated to one or more service areas.

The leader and cabinet are responsible for policies, plans, and strategies, which must be within the budget adopted by the full council. These will be reported to the overall &quot;full&quot; council, which is convened to bring together all elected members of the authority at regular meetings. One or more overview and scrutiny committees holds the cabinet to account for its decisions and is responsible that the democratic checks and balances are maintained.

The principal executive decisions taken by the council as a whole are to appoint the leader, to approve the leader&#x27;s budget, to adopt development plan documents, and to agree on the council&#x27;s constitution. Beyond that, it may raise issues, urge the leader, cabinet, or cabinet members to take actions, or pass a vote of no confidence in the leader.

In addition, the compliance of councillors with their code of conduct may be overseen by a standards committee, although since the coming into effect of the Localism Act 2011 this can be dispensed with and its functions can be delegated to a monitoring officer.

===Elected mayor and cabinet===

The elected mayor and cabinet model was introduced by the Local Government Act 2000. Councils currently operating the mayoral model include:

===Elected mayor and council manager===
The elected mayor and council manager option was also introduced by the Local Government Act 2000, but withdrawn by the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007. The only local authority to adopt the model was Stoke-on-Trent City Council, reverting to leader and cabinet in 2008.

===Alternative arrangements===
Section 31 of the Local Government Act 2000 allowed district councils in two tier areas, with populations under 85,000, to propose alternative executive arrangements. This was superseded by the changes made by the Localism Act 2011 and the renewed availability of the committee system to all local authorities.

===Committee system===
Under the Localism Act 2011, principal authorities (such as unitary authorities, county councils, and district councils) were allowed to return to decision-making by committees, the method of local government administration for all councils prior to 2000. Under this model power is exercised, alongside full council, by a number of committees, made up of councillors in proportion to their parties&#x27; representation on the council. Such councils may choose to nominate a councillor as Leader of the Council for the purposes of representing the political leadership of the council, particularly in relations with external bodies. If no leader is nominated, as was the case prior to 2000, the chair of the council&#x27;s main policy committee may be informally deemed to be the council&#x27;s de facto leader.

==&quot;Hybrid&quot; arrangements==
Some councils operate governance arrangements which have the characteristics of more than one formal governance option. For example, an authority operating under conventional executive arrangements but whose overview and scrutiny committees operate in a manner similar to those under the committee system (developing policy, taking an active part in the decision-making process, etc.).

==Arrangements for moving between governance options==
Provisions exist in legislation for councils to move from one governance model to another.

<text>In Roman mythology, Caeculus (meaning &quot;little blind boy&quot;, from &quot;caecus&quot; &quot;blind&quot;) was a son of Vulcan, and the legendary founder of Praeneste (modern Palestrina).

King Caeculus appears in Book VII of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; as an ally of Turnus against Aeneas and the Trojans, where he is said to be the &quot;founder of Praeneste&quot; and described as &quot;the son of Vulcan, born among the rural herds and found upon the hearth&quot;.

The myth concerning the birth of Caeculus and his divine parentage is of great interest for the study of Latin religion. In the myth he is the nephew of two divine twin brothers (&quot;divi fratres&quot;) called the Depidii (or Digidii). They had a younger sister. One day while she was sitting by the hearth, a spark landed on her and she was impregnated. When the child was born, she exposed him near the temple of Jupiter, where he was found, lying next to a fire, by a group of girls (one version says that these girls were also sisters of the Depidii), who had come to fetch water from a nearby spring. The girls took the child to his uncles, the Depidii, who reared him. 
After spending his childhood among shepherds, he gathered a band of youngsters of his age, and founded the city of Praeneste. 
Caeculus was unharmed by a fire, caused by his casting doubt on the divinity of his ancestry. He also showed mastery over fire by starting and extinguishing another at his will. The smoke though damaged his eyes, which remained smaller than normal, hence his name, Caeculus, &quot;little blind one&quot;.

His story is reminiscent of the practise of ver sacrum and similar to that of Romulus and Remus the founders of Rome.
Caeculus was claimed as the eponymous ancestor of the Roman &quot;gens&quot; Caecilia, and also perhaps by the lesser known &quot;gens&quot; Caesia.

<text>In Roman mythology, Caieta (, &quot;Cāiēta&quot;) was the wet-nurse of Aeneas. The Roman poet Vergil locates her grave on the bay at Gaeta, to which she also gives her name (&quot;cf.&quot; Caietae Portus). The poet Ovid, working a generation later, provides an epitaph:
::HIC • ME • CAIETAM • NOTAE • PIETATIS • ALVMNUS
::EREPTAM • ARGOLICO • QVO • DEBVIT • IGNE • CREMAVIT
&quot;Here me, Caieta, snatched from Grecian flames, my pious son consumed with fitting fire.&quot; The fourth-century commentator Servius writes that there was some controversy about whose wet-nurse Caieta was: in addition to Aeneas, he offers Creusa and Ascanius as possibilities.

<doc id="85126" wikidata="Q857144" url="?curid=85126" title="Camenae">
<text>In Roman mythology, the Camenae (also &quot;Casmenae&quot;, &quot;Camoenae&quot;) were originally goddesses of childbirth, wells and fountains, and also prophetic deities.

==Mythology==
Some mythological figures associated with the Camenae include:
*Carmenta, or Carmentis
*Egeria, or Ægeria, or Aegeria
*Antevorta, or Porrima, or Prorsa
*Postverta, or Postvorta

The last two were sometimes specifically referred to as the Carmentae and in ancient times might have been two aspects of Carmenta rather than separate figures; in later times, however, they are distinct beings believed to protect women in labor.

It is not clear whether these were in fact Camenae themselves, or just closely connected to them.

===Relationship with the Muses===
The Camenae were later identified with the Greek Muses. The first instance of this is in Livius Andronicus&#x27; translation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, rendering the Greek word &quot;Mousa&quot; (Μοῦσα) as &quot;Camena&quot;.

Horace refers to poetic inspiration as the &quot;soft breath of the Greek Camena&quot; (spiritum Graiae tenuem Camenae) in Odes II.16. He also mentions the &quot;nine Camenae&quot; () in the Carmen Saeculare, which denotes the Muses.

==In Latin literature==

Latin authors used the Camenae as a Latinized version of the Greek Muses. This began with Livius Andronicus and continued with Gnaeus Naevius&#x27; epitaph. However, their use waned afterwards until a resurgence around the time of Horace.

Driven from his throne, Metabus and his infant daughter Camilla were chased into the wilderness by armed Volsci. When the river Amasenus blocked his path, he bound her to a spear and promised Diana that Camilla would be her servant if she would safely transport her to the opposite bank. He then safely threw her to the other side, and swam across to retrieve her. The story is told by Virgil in Book XI of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;.

<text>Cardea or Carda was the ancient Roman goddess of the hinge (Latin &quot;cardo, cardinis&quot;), Roman doors being hung on pivot hinges. The Augustan poet Ovid conflates her with another archaic goddess named Carna, whose festival was celebrated on the first day of June and for whom he gives the alternative name Cranê or Cranea, a nymph. Ovid&#x27;s conflation of the goddesses is likely to have been his poetic invention, but it has also been conjectured that &quot;Carna&quot; was a contracted form of &quot;Cardina&quot;, and at minimum Ovid was observing that their traditions were congruent.

==Cardea and doorways==

In the Christian polemic of the Church Fathers, Cardea is associated with two otherwise unknown deities who preside over doorways: Forculus, from &quot;fores&quot;, &quot;door&quot;, plural in form because double doors were common on public buildings and elite homes (&quot;domūs&quot;); and Limentinus, from &quot;limen, liminis&quot;, &quot;threshold&quot; (compare English &quot;liminal&quot;). St. Augustine mocks the apparent triviality of these &quot;little gods&quot; in one of his &quot;attacks against the multitude of gods&quot;, noting that while one doorkeeper is adequate for a human household, the Roman gods require three: &quot;evidently Forculus can&#x27;t watch the hinge and the threshold at the same time.&quot; Modern scholarship has pointed out that this particular set of divinities belongs to rituals of marking out sacred space and fixing boundaries, religious developments hypothesized to have occurred during the transition from pastoralism to an agrarian society. Among Roman deities of this type, Terminus was the most significant.

Stefan Weinstock conjectured that these three doorway deities had a place in cosmology as the &quot;Ianitores terrestres&quot;, &quot;doorkeepers of the earth&quot;, guarding the passage to the earthly sphere. In the schema presented by Martianus Capella, the &quot;Ianitores terrestres&quot; are placed in region 16 among deities of the lowest ranks, while Janus, the divine doorkeeper &quot;par excellence&quot;, is placed in region 1. This arrangement may represent the &quot;ianuae coeli&quot;, the two doors of the heavens identified with the solstices. Isidore of Seville says that there are two &quot;ianuae coeli&quot;, one rising (that is, in the East) and one setting (the West): &quot;The sun advances from the one gate, by the other he recedes.&quot;

Isidore&#x27;s definition is followed immediately by an explanation of the &quot;cardines&quot; (plural of &quot;cardo&quot;), the north-south pivots of the axis on which the sphere of the world rotates. These are analogous to the top-and-bottom pivot hinges of a Roman door.

In addition to the meaning of &quot;door hinge&quot;, the &quot;cardo&quot; was also a fundamental concept in Roman surveying and city planning. The &quot;cardo&quot; was the main north-south street of a town, the surveying of which was attended by augural procedures that aligned terrestrial and celestial space. The &quot;cardo&quot; was also a principle in the layout of the Roman army&#x27;s marching camp, the gates of which were aligned with the cardinal ( a word derived from Latin &quot;cardo/cardinis&quot;) points to the extent that the terrain permitted.

==Carna and the Bean-Kalends==
Macrobius (5th century) says that the name &quot;Carna&quot; was derived from &quot;caro, carnis&quot;, &quot;flesh, meat, food&quot; (compare English &quot;&quot; and &quot;carnivore&quot;), and that she was the guardian of the heart and the vital parts of the human body. The power to avert vampiric &quot;striges&quot;, which Ovid attributes to the conflated Cardea-Carna, probably belonged to Carna, while the charms fixed on doorposts are rightly Cardea&#x27;s.

Carna&#x27;s feast day was marked as &quot;nefastus&quot; on the calendar; that is, it was a public holiday when no assembly or court could convene. Mashed beans and lard – a dish perhaps to be compared to refried beans or hoppinjohn – were offered to her as &quot;res divinae&quot;, and thus the day was known as the &quot;Kalendae fabariae&quot;, the Bean-Kalends, since at this time the bean harvest matured. Beans had many magico-religious properties in ancient Greece and Rome in addition to their importance as a food crop.

William Warde Fowler took Carna to be an archaic goddess whose cult had not been revivified by religious innovation or reform and thus had lapsed into obscurity by the end of the Republic. Auguste Bouché-Leclercq considered Carna a goddess of health. Her elusive nature is indicated by the wildly divergent scholarly conjectures she has prompted: &quot;she was considered a chthonic divinity by Wissowa, a lunar goddess by Pettazzoni, a bean-goddess by Latte, and a patroness of digestion by Dumézil&quot;.

==In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot;==

===The rape of Cranaë===
In the &quot;Fasti&quot; of Ovid, the nymph Cranaë is raped by Janus, a god otherwise portrayed by the poet as avuncular and wise. As a poetic work of art, the &quot;Fasti&quot; is a unique fabrication blending authentic folklore, antiquarian knowledge, and fictional elaboration. It has been interpreted as Ovid&#x27;s challenge to the prevailing orthodoxy of Augustus&#x27;s religious reforms, which were often innovations of Imperial propaganda under the cloak of archaic revivalism.

Ovid begins by noting that the first day of the month is dedicated to Carna. He then identifies her as the goddess of the hinge, who is elsewhere known as Cardea, a name Ovid does not use: &quot;By means of her divine presence (&quot;numen&quot;) she opens things that have been closed, and closes things that have been opened.&quot; The source of her powers (&quot;vires&quot;) have become obscured by time (&quot;aevum&quot;), but he promises that his poem (&quot;carmen&quot;) will clarify the matter (6.101–104).

The setting is the sacred grove (&quot;lucus&quot;) of the otherwise unknown god Alernus (who was considered Cardea&#x27;s father), for whom, Ovid claims, the state priests still carry out &quot;sacra&quot;, sacred rites. The nymph named at that time Cranaë was born there. She was a huntress, often mistaken for the &quot;sister of Phoebus&quot;, that is, Diana, except that she used hunting javelins and nets rather than a bow and arrow. When her many would-be lovers attempted to seduce her, she demurred claiming lack of privacy, and played the same trick on each one: &quot;lead the way to a secluded cave, and I&#x27;ll follow.&quot; As the gullible youth went ahead, Cranaë held back until she was camouflaged among the bushes (6.105–118).

Janus too was seized by desire for the nymph. She responded to his sweet-talk (&quot;verbis mollibus&quot;) by attempting the same ruse; however, as Ovid points out in a characteristic moment of comedy and cruelty colliding, the two faces of Janus allow him to see what goes on behind, and Cranaë was unable to elude him. She was powerless (&quot;nil agis&quot;, &quot;you can do nothing&quot;, the poet repeats twice); the god &quot;occupies her with his embrace&quot;, and after overpowering her to achieve his goal, treats the encounter as contractual: &quot;In exchange for our intercourse (&quot;pro concubitu&quot;), the right (&quot;ius&quot;) of the hinge will be yours; take that as payment for the virginity you deposited&quot; (6.119–128).

As a pledge, he gives her the whitethorn, or hawthorn, which has the power to repel injurious influences from the entrances to houses (6.129–130). This is the &quot;hinge&quot; or turning point of the unnamed Cardea&#x27;s transformation from a maiden nymph of the wild to a goddess who polices the threshold or boundaries (&quot;limina&quot;) of domesticity. The tale of Cranaë&#x27;s rape, though stocked by Roman rather than Greek figures, would be not out of place in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;: the heroine doesn&#x27;t change into a tree, but her transformation resides in the token of the whitethorn tree.

===Carna and the &quot;striges&quot;===
The &quot;aition&quot; of the whitethorn explains why, Ovid says, a branch or twig of it is used to repel &quot;tristes ... noxas&quot;, &quot;baleful harms&quot;, from doorways (&quot;fores&quot;). This is necessary, he says, because there are greedy winged creatures ready to fly in and suck the blood from sleeping infants so young they still take only breast milk. Ovid describes these creatures (6.131–142) as having a large head, prominent eyes, and beaks suited for snatching and carrying off; their wings are white, and their talons are like hooks. They are given the name &quot;striges&quot;, singular &quot;strix&quot;, the word for an owl as a bird of evil omen and supposedly derived from the verb &quot;strideo, stridere&quot;, &quot;shriek&quot;. At the same time, Ovid says that they are the winged creatures who tormented the marooned Phineus by stealing the food off his table – that is, the Harpies. They are a &quot;disconcerting composite&quot; that recalls images on certain curse tablets, one of which shows a &quot;heart-feasting Hecate&quot; that matches Ovid&#x27;s description. The poet himself emphasizes that it&#x27;s hard to tell what they really are, whether they were born as birds, or whether they had been transformed by an incantation (&quot;carmen&quot;, the word Ovid has just used to describe his own account). He then glosses &quot;carmen&quot; as &quot;a crone&#x27;s Marsian chant&quot; &quot;()&quot;.

<text>In ancient Roman religion and myth, Carmenta was a goddess of childbirth and prophecy, associated with technological innovation as well as the protection of mothers and children and a patron of midwives. She was also said to have invented the Latin alphabet.

==Background==
The name &quot;Carmenta&quot; is derived from Latin &quot;carmen&quot;, meaning a magic spell, oracle or song, and also the root of the English word &quot;charm&quot;. Her original name was Nicostrate (, &quot;victory-army&quot;), but it was changed later to honor her renown for giving oracles (Latin singular: &quot;carmen&quot;). She was the mother of Evander of Pallene (fathered by Hermes) and, along with other Greek followers, they founded the town of Pallantium which later was one of the sites of the start of Rome. Gaius Julius Hyginus (&quot;Fab. 277&quot;) mentions the legend that it was she who altered fifteen letters of the Greek alphabet to become the Latin alphabet which her son Evander introduced into Latium.
Carmenta was one of the Camenae and the Cimmerian Sibyl. The leader of her cult was called the &quot;flamen carmentalis&quot;.

It was forbidden to wear leather or other forms of dead skin in her temple which was next to the Porta Carmentalis in Rome. Her festival, called the Carmentalia, was celebrated primarily by women on January 11 and January 15. She is remembered in &quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot;, a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 136162. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature.

<text>Black lady is an American card game of the hearts group for three to six players and the most popular of the group. It emerged in the early 20th century as an elaboration of hearts and was initially also called discard hearts. It is named after its highest penalty card, the queen of spades or &quot;black lady&quot;. It is a trick-avoidance game in which the aim is to avoid taking tricks containing hearts or the black lady. American author and leading bridge exponent, Ely Culbertson, describes it as &quot;essentially hearts with the addition of the queen of spades as a minus card, counting thirteen&quot; and goes on to say that &quot;black lady and its elaborations have completely overshadowed the original hearts in popularity&quot;.

The game is often called hearts in America, although that is the proper name for the basic game in which only the cards of the heart suit incur penalty points. It is known by a variety of other names including American hearts, black lady hearts, black widow and slippery Anne. In Australia it is known as rickety Kate. It is sometimes misnamed black Maria which, however, is the British variant of hearts played with additional penalty cards.

== History ==
Black lady was developed in America in the early 20th century from hearts. It is first mentioned by R. F. Foster in 1909 who describes a variant called &quot;Discard hearts which is sometimes called black jack or black lady&quot;. In black jack, the jack of spades was worth &quot;ten hearts&quot;; in black lady the queen of spades was worth &quot;thirteen hearts&quot;. Discarding three cards was already part of the game as the name discard hearts suggests. The discards were passed to the left. Scoring was simple: one penalty point for every heart captured and thirteen for the queen of spades.

The slam known as &quot;shooting the moon&quot; first appeared in Britain in 1939 in a variant of hearts called hitting the moon. This was essentially black lady with the addition of a slam. Today this feature is a common element in the game.

Black lady was incorporated into Microsoft Windows under the name &quot;Microsoft Hearts&quot;, starting with Windows 3.1.

== Aim ==
The aim of black lady is to avoid capturing heart cards or the queen of spades.

== Earliest rules – Foster (1909) ==

The following rules are based on the earliest known rules – those by R.F. Foster (1909) – in which black lady was an alternative name for discard hearts, itself a variation of classic hearts.

=== Preliminaries ===
The game is designed for three to six players, although &quot;four is the usual number.&quot; A standard 52-card deck of Anglo-American pattern cards is used in which cards rank in their normal order, aces high. If three play, the is removed, if five play, the two black deuces are removed and, if six play, all four deuces are discarded. It was usual practice to play with two decks, one being shuffled while the other was being dealt. Players cut for the choice of seats (aces low), lowest becoming the first dealer and choosing a seat first and then others choosing their seats in their order. Players tying must cut again.

Any player has a right to shuffle, the dealer last. Dealer offers the cards to pone (to the right) for cutting, before dealing all the cards, clockwise and one at a time, to each player starting with eldest hand (to the left). The deal always rotates to the left. After the deal, each player discards three cards to the left-hand neighbour. Players may not view the cards they receive before selecting their discards.

=== Playing ===
The aim is to avoid taking any hearts or the black lady () in the tricks. Eldest hand leads any card to the first trick. Players must follow suit if they can; otherwise may discard. There is no trump suit. The winner of a trick leads to the next.

=== Scoring ===
Foster&#x27;s scoring scheme for basic hearts is that players start with a fixed number of counters (50 or 100) and pay one counter into the pool for each heart captured; the Black Lady being worth thirteen. The pool is claimed by the person or people winning it. There are two ways of deciding a winner. In the sweepstake method, the pool may only be claimed by a player or players who takes no hearts at all. If everyone takes at least one, the pool stays and forms a &#x27;jack&#x27; (hence &#x27;jackpot&#x27;) until someone eventually takes no hearts at the end of a deal. If more than one player takes no hearts, they divide the pool, any odd counters staying put. In the &#x27;Howell&#x27; method, at the end of each deal, players pay into the pool &quot;per opponent&quot; as many counters as they took hearts. So in a four-player game, if Andy takes the Black Lady and a heart i.e. 14 hearts, he pays counters into the pool. Once everyone had paid up, players claim as many counters as they &quot;did not hold&quot; at the end (26 minus the number of penalty points scored). So Andy may claim counters. This exhausts the pool and is designed to be a fairer reflection of the players&#x27; ability. The Black Lady ranks as a spade within the spade suit and so may be discarded if any other suit is played.

== Culbertson&#x27;s rules (1950) ==
The following rules are based on those by American bridge expert, Ely Culbertson, where it is described as a separate game that is &quot;essentially Hearts with the addition of the queen of spades as a minus card, counting thirteen&quot;. However, he omitted to mention that it also differed in retaining the discard or passing feature of Black Lady/Discard Hearts. The main change from the earliest rules is a much simplified scoring system. Culbertson includes a slam, first introduced by Phillips in 1939, but this time no points are scored for it.

=== Preliminaries ===
According to Culbertson, black lady may be played by three to seven players, individually, the best number being four. The standard 52-card deck is used and, in order to ensure each player gets the same number of cards, twos are discarded in the order: , , and . Aces are high. Again, players may pass any three cards face down and to the left. As an alternative rule, however, players may pass cards alternately to the left and then right from deal to deal.

=== Playing ===
Eldest hand leads to the first trick with any card. Players must follow suit if they can; otherwise may discard any card. A trick is won by the highest card of the led suit and the winner of the trick leads to the next.

=== Scoring ===
When all the tricks are played, players total up their scores. Each heart card captured scores one penalty point and the black lady scores thirteen. If one player takes all the penalty cards, no scores are recorded for that deal. When the first player reaches 100 points, the game ends and the winner is the player with the lowest score.

== Modern rules – Morehead (2001) ==
Glenn and Denton (2003) state that this version &quot;is nearly universal in the United States.&quot; These rules are based on Morehead (2001), except where stated. The major differences are the rules on passing and the scoring scheme for &quot;shooting the moon&quot; which reflects the earliest rule by Phillips.

=== Preliminaries ===
Three to six may play, but the game is best for four. There are no partnerships and no trumps. The standard deck is used and an even distribution of cards is achieved by removing as many of the following as are needed: , , and . Cards rank in the normal order with Aces high. &quot;Alternative rule:&quot; any cards left over after the deal are put into a &quot;kitty&quot; and the winner of the first trick adds them to his or her tricks. Some rules allow the winner of the first trick to view the kitty as well.

Players cut for the deal, the player drawing the lowest card becoming the first dealer. Cards are dealt clockwise beginning with eldest hand. After the deal each player selects three cards to discard and passes them to the left-hand neighbour. This must be done before viewing the cards received from the right. &quot;Alternative rule:&quot; In the American version of this game, called American Hearts by Glenn and Denton, the cards are passed differently in successive deals. For the first deal, cards are passed to the left. For the second deal, cards are passed to the right. In the third deal, cards are passed across the table and in the fourth deal, players &#x27;hold&#x27; i.e. do not pass any cards.

=== Playing ===
Card play follows the normal rules: eldest hand leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if able; otherwise, they may play a card from any suit. The highest card of the led suit wins the trick, and the trick winner leads to the next. &quot;Alternative rules:&quot; The player holding the leads with that card. Some rules state that neither hearts nor the Black Lady may be led until the first heart has been discarded. According to Morehead, in club play, the player with the may be required to play it at the first opportunity by discarding or following a higher spade.

An innovation in modern black lady is the &quot;take-all&quot; or &quot;shooting the moon&quot;, whereby a player may aim to capture all the penalty cards; i.e., the black lady and all hearts. In this event the player scores zero, while each opponent scores twenty-six penalty points. In a failed attempt, penalty points are scored as normal. Morehead gives the old scoring rule that no players score for the deal and the other alternative that the player who successfully shoots the moon scores twenty-six plus points.

=== Scoring ===
Apart from shooting the moon, the usual scoring system is employed with players scoring one penalty point for each heart card taken and thirteen for taking the Black Lady. Game is 100 points. When the first player reaches this score, the game stops and players settle their scores.

== Variations ==

=== Passing cards===
Unlike the basic game of hearts, card passing has always been a feature of black lady. It is also referred to as discarding, hence the earliest alternative name for black lady was discard hearts. The idea is that, before each hand begins, each player chooses three cards and passes them to another player. Cards are usually passed to the left, unlike the British game of Black Maria, where cards are passed to the right. Passing cards to the left is easier because you know something about the hand of the player who follows you whereas, in passing cards to the right, you have no information about the hand of the player to your left.

In the earliest rules, passing was always to the left. Today, there are many variations of passing:

* Four-way passing. The most common method, popularized by computer versions, rotates passing through four deals; on the first deal, players pass to the left, the second deal to the right, the third across the table. On the fourth deal no cards are passed; alternatively players may pass one card to each opponent (&quot;scatter pass&quot;). The cycle of four deals is then repeated. 
* Left and right. The discarded cards are passed alternately left and right with each deal.
* Star passing. With an odd number of players, passing across is not possible. If five play, players choose two cards and pass one each to the two players opposite. The pattern of passing routes forms a five-point star.
* Shuffle passing. Players choose three cards and discard them to a central pile. The dealer then gathers, shuffles, and re-deals these cards.
* Two cards. When there are more than four players, only two cards can be passed.
* Dealer&#x27;s choice. The dealer chooses the number of cards to be passed and the direction of passing.
* Rotating pass. Players pass in the following cycle: one player to the left, two players to the left, three players to the left, etc. This method accommodates any number of players. Additionally, if the cycle ends with a &quot;no pass&quot; round, one player (the one to the first dealer&#x27;s right) will always pass to the dealer; this can assist in remembering where to pass cards.

Some versions prohibit passing some combination of , or .

=== Trick play ===
There are some common variants to this play:
* The player holding must lead it to begin the first trick. In variations with removed, play starts with .
* Hearts cannot be led until either they have been &quot;broken&quot; (discarded on the lead of another suit), or the player who must lead has nothing but Hearts remaining in hand. In some variations, any penalty card, including , can break Hearts.
** In a sub-variation of the above, if a player&#x27;s hand contains nothing but Hearts and other penalty cards, even if Hearts have not been broken, the player can lead a heart. Hearts are of course broken by this play.
* If jokers are used, rules must be defined concerning their play. Common conventions include:
** Two distinct jokers are designated as the zero of clubs and the zero of diamonds, and behave just like ordinary clubs and diamonds.
** Non-distinct jokers are valueless cards that cannot take tricks. They may be played at all times (except to lead tricks), or perhaps only when following suit is not possible.
** Jokers may also be considered as penalty cards. They may behave as normal penalty cards, or they might only score if played to a hearts trick.
** Jokers may be allowed to lead. If they are, the leading player calls a suit which must be followed, or the lead suit may be determined by the next card played.
* If the game uses multiple decks, and two identical cards tie for taking the trick, the most recently played card takes precedence. Cancellation Hearts (see the Variations section) defines different behavior involving identical cards.
* &quot;Booster nines.&quot; If a nine is played, the trick is extended by one round.

=== Shooting the moon ===
Shooting the moon is a very common scoring variation. If one player takes all the penalty cards on one deal, that player&#x27;s score remains unchanged while 26 penalty points are added to the scores of each of the other players. This is known as playing by &quot;old moon&quot; rules. In the &quot;new moon&quot; rules, the player subtracts 26 points from their own score instead of adding 26 to the others.

There are several sub-variations to these rules:
* A player who shoots the moon may have a choice between old moon or new moon.
* A player who shoots the moon can choose new moon only if applying old moon for the hand would end the game with the shooter losing by points. For example, in a 100-point game, if the shooter has 90, a second player 95, and the leader 63, the shooter and the second player would lose the game since the second player would be on 121 points, the shooter on 90, and the leader on 89. Alternatively, the old moon stands, but the game continues (even though, in the example, the second player is on 121 points) for as long as there are no successful shoot the moon outcomes. At that point, the winner is the player with the lowest score, even if this is over 100.
* A player who shoots the moon may only use new moon after he or she, or perhaps another player, has reached a predetermined score.
* A player who takes all thirteen tricks may add 52 points to the other players&#x27; scores, subject to the other variations listed above. This is known as &quot;shooting the sun&quot;.
* A player who shoots the sun may add 52 points to the player who passed to him or her at the beginning of the round, while the others each receive 26. This is known as the &quot;punishment rule&quot;.
* A player who takes all thirteen tricks reverts their score from the entire game to 0. This is known as &quot;cleaning the slate&quot;.
* A player who takes all of the penalty cards but fails to shoot the sun scores normally instead of shooting the moon.
* The first trick of a hand does not count for shooting the sun; only the following twelve tricks are required. This allows a player who holds the two of clubs to shoot the sun, in the variant where the two of clubs is required to be the first lead.
* If a player receives 260 points (26 points every round) over ten rounds, all other players may receive 260 points and the player finishes with a score of 0, or all other players receive 100 in a normal game. This variant is called &quot;shooting the big moon&quot;.
* A game cannot end immediately when a player shoots the moon or sun. Play continues for at least one more hand.

=== Scoring ===
A player who takes no tricks scores –5 penalty points.

A player that achieves a score of exactly 100 has their score reduced to zero. In this variant a score of 101 or greater is required to end the game.

== Variants ==
The main variants of black lady are cancellation hearts, omnibus hearts and pink lady.

=== Cancellation hearts ===

Cancellation hearts is first described in 1950 by Culbertson and is a variant designed for larger numbers of players, typically 6 to 11 players, using two decks shuffled together. If exactly the same card is played twice in one trick, the cards cancel each other out, and neither can take the trick. If two such pairs appear in the same trick, the whole trick is cancelled and the cards are rolled over to the winner of the next trick.

=== Omnibus hearts ===
In 1950, Culbertson reported that omnibus hearts was &quot;rapidly becoming the most popular of hearts games&quot; and was so called because it included all the features found in different members of the hearts family and Arnold states that it is &quot;sufficiently different and popular&quot; to justify being described as a separate game.&quot; In effect, omnibus hearts is really a variant of black lady to which has been added the bonus card of the which earns 10 plus points for the player who takes it in a trick. If a player takes all fifteen counters (, and thirteen hearts), 26 plus points are scored for the deal and the rest score zero (noting that in Culbertson&#x27;s black lady rules, what is now called shooting the moon results in no player scoring for that deal). Arnold (2011) states that omnibus hearts is considered the best version of hearts by many players. He refers to the capture of all counting cards as &quot;hitting the moon, take-all or slam&quot;. The game ends when a player reaches or exceeds 100 penalty points, whereupon the player with the lowest score wins.

=== Pink lady ===
Pink lady is an &quot;almost forgotten variant&quot; that &quot;doubles the fun of black lady&quot;, &quot;adding interest and intensity.&quot; Its key feature is the addition of an extra high penalty card, the or pink lady, which scores 13 penalty points like her counterpart, the . There are now 38 penalty points to be avoided per deal. The presence of the pink lady makes the and as dangerous as their spade counterparts and forms a counter to the black lady, enabling a player saddled with one &#x27;lady&#x27; the opportunity to even the score by offloading the other. Spadaccini, like Gibson, recommends playing to 100 points.

=== Black jack ===
Black jack is recorded by Foster as early as 1909 and has appeared sporadically in the literature since. The takes the place of the black lady but is worth 10 hearts or penalty points instead of thirteen. Moss (1995) calls it &quot;black jack hearts&quot;. In early rules, the black jack may be discarded if its holder is void in the suit led. In later rules, the black jack must be discarded before any other card if the player is void in the led suit.

=== Other variants ===
* &quot;Complex hearts&quot;. A variant by game designer Richard Garfield using the complex number system. Hearts are worth 1 each, = 13, = −10, and multiplies the score for the given hand by 2. The first player to reach an absolute value of 100 is the loser.
* &quot;Danger hearts.&quot; Ten rounds are played using standard scoring, and each player has three lives. If a player receives 15 or more points in a round, he or she loses a life.
* &quot;Royal hearts&quot; A game produced by Parker Brothers, but which may easily be played with an ordinary card pack. The is worth 26 points instead of 13, doubles the point value of all Hearts taken by that player, is worth −10 points, and negates the &#x27;s point value if both are captured by the same player.

=== Regional variants ===
* &quot;Gong Zhu&quot; (&quot;Push Out the Pig&quot;) is a Chinese version. The aim is to take tricks containing bonus cards and avoid those with penalty cards. The counters are: to = −10, = −20, = −30, = −40, = −50, = −100, = +100 and , which doubles the score for the round.
* &quot;Likha&quot; or &quot;Leekha&quot;. Middle Eastern partnership variant. Play is anticlockwise and suit must be followed if possible. and the are the &quot;likha&quot;. If a player holds both (&quot;talyeekh&quot;) and cannot follow suit, one of them must be played. is worth 13 penalty points, 10 and every heart 1. Game is 101. The team of the first player to individually score 101 or more loses. If two or more players from opposing teams reach or exceed 101 in the same deal, the one with the higher score loses. Shooting the moon incurs a 37-point penalty.

== Strategy ==
=== General ===
With the exception of trying to shoot the moon, players attempt to discard high cards, especially high hearts or spades, and try to avoid winning points. This can either be accomplished by creating a void or playing a high card last in a trick that has no points. Generally speaking, it is advantageous to play the highest card possible without winning the trick. Players particularly concentrate on getting rid of high cards in suits that they do not have padding low cards in. For example, if a player had the would not be much of an issue; they can play the four lower cards and hopefully exhaust another player&#x27;s spades before being forced to play the . In contrast, if they only had , then they would be forced to play the the first time spades were led, with the risk that another player will respond with .

=== Passing ===
The main objectives of passing are to try to become &quot;short&quot; or &quot;void&quot; in a suit, and thus able to play off-suit when that suit is led; or to rid one&#x27;s hand of &quot;dangerous&quot; cards that could force a player to take a trick containing penalty points, such as the ace, king, or queen of any suit (especially spades and hearts). and are two of the most important cards to get rid of, because they are not worth any points themselves but are ranked higher than and as such would force players to take the queen if are lead. In addition, high hearts can leave the player defenseless once hearts are broken. When creating voids, it is best to do that in either clubs or diamonds, because players want to avoid receiving high hearts or spades without having any padding. For this reason, spades lower than the queen are typically not passed unless the player is attempting to shoot the moon. Care must be taken in passing too many high cards which could allow the player receiving the cards to shoot the moon. A simple passing strategy to keep a recipient from shooting the moon is to pass them a single low-value heart, this is especially effective when holding on to the , because when a player has at least one heart it is impossible to shoot the moon without it. As such, it is often wise not to pass the at all.

=== Voids ===
A void is when a player does not have any cards of a certain suit. Generally, this is a highly advantageous situation, because it prevents the player from winning any points in that suit, and provides a means to dispose of poor cards. These can be intentionally created with good passing strategy, or appear by themselves.

=== Bleeding spades ===
If a player does not have , , or , it is to that player&#x27;s advantage to lead spades to try to force onto another player. This is also referred to as &quot;smoking the lady/queen&quot;, in reference to the combat action of creating smoke in a closed area so that any enemy combatants hiding there would be forced to come out into the open (the is forced to be played by its bearer, thus causing the &#x27;s points to be taken by that bearer, and thus evaded by the player actuating the smoking). A player who has or but not , and with a large number of other spades, may feel insulated from being forced to play or in any subsequent smoking play, and thus could also participate in smoking. Even the player that has the , provided he or she similarly has a lot of other spades may decide to &quot;smoke himself&quot; to empty all the other players of their spades, thus ironically insulating himself from being smoked in the future – or perhaps to get the game into the situation in which another player(s) has a &quot;dry&quot; (i.e., solitary) spade that is or , in which case a trick could be started with in the full knowledge that some other player has this dry or and will be forced to play it, taking the &#x27;s points.

=== Shooting the moon ===
Attempting to shoot the moon is often a risky strategy, as failure to capture every single penalty card will result in the remaining penalty points (as many as 25, if only one heart is missed) being added to one&#x27;s score. 
Shooting the moon can rapidly change the direction of a game in a player&#x27;s favour. A good hand for shooting the moon should contain significant high cards, in addition to a long run of a single suit that can be used to keep the lead once the other players have run out of that suit. Furthermore, it is necessary to either have no hearts, or most/all high hearts (, , , ), as shooting the moon requires a player to win every trick they lead with hearts. Even with , and a moon attempt will invariably fail, because savvy players will not discard the before multiple people have scored at least one point, so the will ensure them at least one trick containing points. 

=== Teaming up ===
Because black lady is generally understood to have only one winner when the game ends, some of the general strategies change when one or more players are at risk of reaching 100 points. In such scenarios it becomes strategical for players to work together to ensure the goes to the lowest score player, in order to close the gap before the game ends. Similarly, when a player is at 87 points or more and receives the , everyone but the lowest score player can assist that player in shooting the moon (as long as the new moon rule is in play) so that the game does not end immediately, giving everyone a chance to catch up.

<text>Elah ( &quot;’Ēlā&quot;; ; ) was the fourth king of Israel, the son and successor of Baasha. William F. Albright has dated his reign to 877–876 BCE, while E. R. Thiele offers the dates 886–885 BCE. 

Chapter 16 of 1 Kings relates how Elah and all his family members were murdered by his chariot commander Zimri, who became his successor.

<text>There are two Catilli in Roman legend:

* Catillus the Arcadian, son of Amphiaraus.
* Catillus, his son.

Catillus the Arcadian and his sons Catillus, Coras, and Tiburtus escaped the mass killing at Thebes and arrived at the Aniene Plateau. They drove away the Sicilians who lived there and founded a city named Tibur (now Tivoli) in honor of Tiburtus.

In Book VII of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, the twin brothers, Catillus and Coras, leave Tibur and head for Latium to fight against Aeneas and the Trojans as an ally of Turnus.

Horace (&quot;Odes&quot; 18.2) records the name as &quot;Cātilus&quot;; Virgil (&quot;Aeneid&quot; 7.672) and Silius Italicus as &quot;Cātillus&quot;, and Statius as &quot;Catillus&quot;. There was a in Tibur, presumably the modern Monte Catillo.

<doc id="85147" wikidata="Q1100314" url="?curid=85147" title="Clementia">
<text>In Roman mythology and ancient religion, Clementia is the goddess of clemency, leniency, mercy, forgiveness, penance, redemption, absolution, acquittal, and salvation.

== Description ==
She was defined as a celebrated virtue of Julius Caesar, who was famed for his forbearance, especially following Caesar&#x27;s civil war with Pompey from 49 BC. In 44 BC, a temple was consecrated to her by the Roman Senate, possibly at Caesar&#x27;s instigation as Caesar was keen to demonstrate that he had this virtue.

In a letter to his friend Atticus, Cicero is discussing Caesar&#x27;s &quot;clementia&quot;: &quot;You will say they are frightened. I dare say they are, but I&#x27;ll be bound they&#x27;re more frightened of Pompey than of Caesar. They are delighted with his artful clemency and fear the other&#x27;s wrath.&quot; Again in &quot;Pro rege Deiotaro&quot; (For King Deiotarus) Cicero discusses Caesar&#x27;s virtue of &quot;clementia&quot;.

== Cult ==
There is not much information surrounding Clementia&#x27;s cult; it would seem that she was merely an abstraction of a particular virtue, one that was revered in conjunction with revering Caesar and the Roman state. Clementia was seen as a good trait within a leader, it also the Latin word for &quot;humanity&quot; or &quot;forbearance&quot;. This is opposed to &quot;Saevitia&quot; which was savagery and bloodshed. Yet, she was the Roman counterpart of Eleos, (not to be confused with Soteria), the Greek goddess of mercy and forgiveness who had a shrine in Athens.

In traditional imagery, she is depicted holding a branch (possibly an olive tree branch) and a scepter and may be leaning on a column.

<text>The Clitunno, in Antiquity the Clitumnus, is a river in Umbria, Italy. The name is of uncertain origin, but it was also borne by the river god. The Clitunno rises from a spring within a dozen metres of the ancient Via Flaminia near the town of Campello sul Clitunno between Spoleto and Trevi.

The spring was well described by Pliny the Younger who records his visit toward the end of the first century AD:
Virgil mentions the site too in Book II of his &quot;Georgics&quot; where he celebrates &quot;. . . the milk-white herds of the Clitumnus, those bulls that often bathed in the river&#x27;s sacred stream, the noblest of the victims Romans sacrifice at their triumphs . . .&quot;

It was visited by Caligula and by the emperor Honorius. It was also celebrated as a great beauty spot by Byron and Giosuè Carducci; in the 19th century it was planted with willows, and zealously monitored for pollution. It is open today as a paying tourist attraction.

The Clitunno then flows, generally north, through the east Umbrian plain, past the church of the so-called Temple of Clitumnus and the towns of Pissignano, Cannaiola and Trevi, to join the Timia, a tributary of the Topino, near Bevagna. Though its current is usually sluggish, it is subject, like many other rivers in the east Umbrian plain, to sudden flooding. It was only tamed completely in the 19th century, and is largely banked by levees.

The Temple of Clitumnus, later a church, lies on its bank.

<text>Cloacina was a goddess who presided over the Cloaca Maxima (&#x27;Greatest Drain&#x27;), the main interceptor discharge outfall of the system of sewers in Rome. 

== Name ==
The theonym &quot;Cloācīna&quot; is a derivative of the noun &quot;cloāca&quot; (&#x27;sewer, underground drainage&#x27;; cf. &quot;cluere&quot; &#x27;to purify&#x27;), itself from Proto-Italic *&quot;klowā&quot;-, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;ḱleuH-o-&quot; (&#x27;clean&#x27;). A cult-title of Venus, &quot;Cloācīna&quot; may be interpreted as meaning &#x27;The Purifier&#x27;.

In later English works, phrases such as &quot;the temple of Cloacina&quot; were sometimes used as euphemisms for the toilet.

== Cult ==
The Cloaca Maxima was said to have been begun by Tarquinius Priscus, one of Rome&#x27;s Etruscan kings, and finished by another, Tarquinius Superbus: Cloacina might have originally been an Etruscan deity. According to one of Rome&#x27;s foundation myths, Titus Tatius, king of the Sabines, erected a statue to Cloacina at the place where Romans and Sabines met to confirm the end of their conflict, following the rape of the Sabine women. Tatius instituted lawful marriage between Sabines and Romans, uniting them as one people, ruled by himself and by Rome&#x27;s founder, Romulus. The peace between Sabines and Romans was marked by a cleansing ritual using myrtle, at or very near an ancient Etruscan shrine to Cloacina, above a small stream that would later be enlarged as the main outlet for Rome&#x27;s main sewer, the Cloaca Maxima. As myrtle was one of Venus&#x27; signs, and Venus was a goddess of union, peace and reconciliation, Cloacina was recognised as Venus Cloacina (Venus the Cleanser). She was also credited with the purification of sexual intercourse within marriage.

The small, circular shrine of Venus Cloacina was situated before the Basilica Aemilia on the Roman Forum and directly above the Cloaca Maxima. Some Roman coins had images of Cloacina&#x27;s shrine. The clearest show two females, presumed to be deities, each with a bird perched on a pillar. One holds a small object, possibly a flower; birds and flowers are signs of Venus, among other deities. The figures may have represented the two aspects of the divinity, Cloacina-Venus.

<doc id="85157" wikidata="Q868923" url="?curid=85157" title="Consus">
<text>In ancient Roman religion, the god Consus was the protector of grains. He was represented by a grain seed. His altar &quot;(ara)&quot; was located at the first &quot;meta&quot; of the Circus Maximus. It was either underground, or according to other sources, covered with earth, which was swept off during the two Consualia, his festivals on August 21, December 15, and on July 7 when the pontiffs held a sacrifice there. He was thus a chthonic god.

The &quot;Flamen Quirinalis&quot; and the Vestals officiated at his rites.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of the name &quot;Consus&quot; is uncertain. It may be of Etruscan or Sabine origin. In the folk etymology of antiquity, the name was related to the Latin verb &quot;conserere&quot;, &quot;to sow,&quot; as was the title of the goddess Ops as &quot;Consivia&quot; or &quot;Consiva&quot;.

The late Republican theologian Varro said that the Consualia were named for Consus. G. Dumézil and G. Capdeville consider verb &quot;condere&quot;, &quot;to store&quot;, to be the best etymology: &quot;Consus&quot; would be an archaic verbal noun denoting the action of storing grain.

Capdeville states that &quot;Consus&quot; cannot be related to &quot;conserere&quot; and adjective &quot;consivius&quot;, and advances the hypothesis that &quot;condere&quot; might have to be taken in the meaning of &quot;to found&quot; or &quot;establish&quot;.

Ancient sources, Festus included, were very fond of the similar sound of &quot;Consus&quot; and &quot;consilium&quot;, and allegorically interpreted his name as relating to &quot;council&quot; or &quot;assembly&quot; (&quot;consilium&quot;).
Moreover, Tertullian reports that on one of the &quot;metae&quot; of the circus maximus an inscription read: &quot;Consus consilio, Mars duello, Lares coillo po[tentes]&quot;. which may be archaic considering &quot;co[v]illo&quot; and external factors. This is close to &quot;hide&quot; too cf. &quot;abdere, (abs)condere&quot;. This derivation is certain, but on the other hand, as de Vaan writes on the etymology of &quot;consilium&quot;, it is very uncertain whence comes the head word, &quot;consulere-solere&quot;, although very probably not from &quot;con-sideo&quot;.

==Function and associations==
The festivals of Ops (Opiconsivia or Opalia) followed Consus&#x27; closely, being held every August 25 and December 19, at the time of reaping and the seeding of crops.

Consus became a god associated with secret conferences. The grammarian Servius says that Consus is the god of councils. This fact stems from the role played by Consus in the abduction of the Sabine women, which took place on the occasion of the &quot;Consualia aestiva&quot; and was considered to have been advised by the god himself.
This power of hidden counselling held by Consus seems to be related to the concept expressed by Dionysius and Plutarch that he is the &quot;holder&quot; of the Earth, an idea that makes of him a parallel to Neptune.

So although it is certain that &quot;condere&quot; and &quot;consulere&quot; are from two different roots, it looks the character of Consus as hidden master of the Earth was at the basis of the identification with Neptune, as well as the strict affinity of the two gods with the horse.

According to G. Capdeville, it was a customary event that games were held at the foundation of a new settlement. These were connected with rituals that included athletic games such as footraces and marriage games along with invitations to settle in the new town: He mentions the instances of Caeculus at Praeneste and other settlements in Crete (Dreros, Hierapytna, Praisos, Lyttos, Knossos). These events all had a religious meaning. In Crete, as well as in Rome, it looks like the god involved was Vulcan (), i.e. the Cretan &quot;megas Kouros&quot;, later interpreted as Zeus. In Rome the relationship of Vulcan with Consus is apparent in the dates of their festivals and the fact that the &quot;flamen volcanalis&quot; officiated at the Calends of May the sacrifice to Bona Dea.

Consus is perhaps to be identified with &quot;Equestrian Neptune&quot; (&quot;Neptunus Equestris&quot;). Mule or horse races were the main event of the festival. During the festival horses and mules were garlanded with flowers, and given a rest from work. This fact is ascribed by Capdeville to the fact that Poseidon was the successor of the unknown god of the Arcadian Hippocrateia mentioned by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who himself was perhaps the successor of a horse god. A close connection of Consus with the two Pales and of both with the horse looks apparent.

<text>Marcus Curtius is a mythological young Roman who offered himself to the gods of Hades. He is mentioned shortly by Varro and at length by Livius. He is the legendary namesake of the Lacus Curtius in the Roman Forum, the site of his supposed self-sacrifice.

==Legendary biography==
After an earthquake in 362 BC, a huge deep pit suddenly opened in the Roman Forum, which the Romans attempted to fill, but in vain. Despairing, they consulted an augur who responded that the gods demanded the most precious possession of Rome. The Romans doubted the warning, and struggled to think of what that was. 

However, a young soldier named Marcus Curtius castigated them and responded that arms and the courage of Romans were the nation&#x27;s most precious possessions. Astride his horse, fully and meticulously armed and decorated, Marcus rode and leapt into the chasm. Immediately, the deep pit closed over him, saving Rome. 

The Lacus Curtius in the Forum was supposedly built on the site of the pit, and receives its name from him.

==Art history==
The story of Marcus Curtius, sacrificing himself for the cause of the commonwealth, became well known theme during the Renaissance, due to etchings made by the German artist Lucas Cranach the Elder (1507/1508) and the Dutch artist Hendrick Goltzius (1586). It was also depicted in the famous &quot;Nuremberg Chronicle&quot; by Hartmann Schedel (1493). A bas-relief, apparently found in a garden near the Forum Romanum in 1553, seems to have been leading in most images. It dates from the Early Empire, but may have been copied from a 3rd- or 2nd-century BC piece. Benjamin Robert Haydon (1786-1846) painted a large oil entitled Marcus Curtius Leaping into the Gulf (c. 1843)
