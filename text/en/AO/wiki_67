<text>Tracy Dale Terrell (June 23, 1943December 2, 1991) was an American education theorist who, along with Stephen Krashen, wrote &quot;The Natural Approach&quot;. The natural approach is a comprehension-based language learning methodology which emphasizes the idea of exposure and the lowering of affective or emotional barriers to learning.

Terrell was a professor at the University of California, San Diego.

==Career==
Tracy D. Terrell graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a Ph.D. in linguistics and in a comparatively short career of twenty-two years became one of the most important American Hispanists and theoretical linguists. He taught at the University of California, Irvine from 1970 until 1985 when he accepted a position in the linguistics department at the University of California, San Diego. He retired in 1989, finally succumbing to AIDS in 1991. He is credited along with Stephen Krashen with the development of the “Natural Approach” to second language learning, now a widely utilized method of teaching second languages. In addition, he is widely respected for his work in Hispanic linguistics. Dr. Terrell was fluent in Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Dutch—for which he had a special affection.

<text>Persepolis (; ; ) was the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire (). It is situated in the plains of Marvdasht, encircled by the southern Zagros mountains, Fars province of Iran. It is one of the key Iranian cultural heritage sites and a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979.

The earliest remains of Persepolis date back to 515 BC. The city, acting as a major center for the empire, housed a palace complex and citadel designed to serve as the focal point for governance and ceremonial activities. It exemplifies the Achaemenid style of architecture. The complex was taken by the army of Alexander the Great in 330 BC, and soon after, its wooden parts were completely destroyed by fire, likely deliberately.

The function of Persepolis remains unclear. It was not one of the largest cities in ancient Iran, let alone the rest of the empire, but appears to have been a grand ceremonial complex that was only occupied seasonally; the complex was raised high on a walled platform, with five &quot;palaces&quot; or halls of varying size, and grand entrances. It is still not entirely clear where the king&#x27;s private quarters actually were. Until recently, most archaeologists held that it was primarily used for celebrating Nowruz, the Persian New Year, held at the spring equinox, which is still an important annual festivity in Iran. The Iranian nobility and the tributary parts of the empire came to present gifts to the king, as represented in the stairway reliefs. It is also unclear what permanent structures there were outside the palace complex; it may be better to think of Persepolis as only one complex rather than a &quot;city&quot; in the usual sense.

The exploration of Persepolis from the early 17th century led to the modern rediscovery of cuneiform writing and, from detailed studies of the trilingual Achaemenid royal inscriptions found on the ruins, the initial decipherment of cuneiform in the early 19th century.

==Etymology==
&quot;Persepolis&quot; is derived from the Greek , a compound of () and (, together meaning &quot;the Persian city&quot; or &quot;the city of the Persians&quot;). To the ancient Persians, the city was known as (), which is also the word for the region of Persia.
An inscription left in 311 AD by Sasanian Prince Shapur Sakanshah, the son of Hormizd II, refers to the site as , meaning &quot;Hundred Pillars&quot;. Because medieval Persians attributed the site to Jamshid, a king from Iranian mythology, it has been referred to as (, ; ), literally meaning &quot;Throne of Jamshid&quot;. Another name given to the site in the medieval period was (, &quot;Forty Minarets&quot;), transcribed as in De Silva Figueroa and as Chilminar in early English sources.

==Geography==
Persepolis is near the small river Pulvar, which flows into the Kur River. The site includes a terrace, partly artificially constructed and partly cut out of a mountain, with its east side leaning on Rahmat Mountain.

==History==
===Construction===
Archaeological evidence shows that the earliest remains of Persepolis date back to 515 BC. André Godard, the French archaeologist who excavated Persepolis in the early 1930s, believed that it was Cyrus the Great who chose the site of Persepolis, but that it was Darius I who built the terrace and the palaces. Inscriptions on these buildings support the belief that they were constructed by Darius.

With Darius I, the sceptre passed to a new branch of the royal house. The country&#x27;s true capitals were Susa, Babylon and Ecbatana. This may be why the Greeks were not acquainted with the city until Alexander the Great took and plundered it.


Darius I&#x27;s construction of Persepolis was carried out parallel to that of the Palace of Susa. According to Gene R. Garthwaite, the Susa Palace served as Darius&#x27; model for Persepolis. Darius I ordered the construction of the Apadana and the Council Hall ( or the &quot;Triple Gate&quot;), as well as the main imperial Treasury and its surroundings. These were completed during the reign of his son, Xerxes I. Further construction of the buildings on the terrace continued until the downfall of the Achaemenid Empire. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the Greek historian Ctesias mentioned that Darius I&#x27;s grave was in a cliff face that could be reached with an apparatus of ropes.

Around 519 BC, construction of a broad stairway was begun. Grey limestone was the main building material used at Persepolis. The uneven plan of the terrace, including the foundation, acted like a castle, whose angled walls enabled its defenders to target any section of the external front.

===Destruction===
After invading Achaemenid Persia in 330 BC, Alexander the Great sent the main force of his army to Persepolis by the Royal Road. Diodorus Siculus writes that on his way to the city, Alexander and his army were met by 800 Greek artisans who had been captured by the Persians. Most were elderly and suffered some form of mutilation, such as a missing hand or foot. They explained to Alexander the Persians wanted to take advantage of their skills in the city but handicapped them so they could not easily escape. Alexander and his staff were disturbed by the story and provided the artisans with clothing and provisions before continuing on to Persepolis. Diodorus does not cite this as a reason for the destruction of Persepolis, but it is possible Alexander started to see the city in a negative light after this encounter.

Upon reaching the city, Alexander stormed the Persian Gates, a pass through Zagros Mountains. There, Ariobarzanes of Persis successfully ambushed Alexander the Great&#x27;s army, inflicting heavy casualties. After being held off for 30 days, Alexander the Great outflanked and destroyed the defenders. Ariobarzanes himself was killed either during the battle or during the retreat to Persepolis. Some sources indicate that the Persians were betrayed by a captured tribal chief who showed the Macedonians an alternate path that allowed them to outflank Ariobarzanes in a reversal of Thermopylae. After several months, Alexander allowed his troops to loot Persepolis.
Around that time, a fire burned &quot;the palaces&quot; or &quot;the palace&quot;.

It is believed that the fire which destroyed Persepolis started from Hadish Palace, which was the living quarters of Xerxes I, and spread to the rest of the city. It is not clear if the fire was an accident or a deliberate act of revenge for the burning of the Acropolis of Athens during the second Persian invasion of Greece. Many historians argue that, while Alexander&#x27;s army celebrated with a symposium, they decided to take revenge against the Persians. If that is so, then the destruction of Persepolis could be both an accident and a case of revenge. The fire may also have had the political purpose of destroying an iconic symbol of the Persian monarchy that might have become a focus for Persian resistance.

Several, much later, Greek and Roman accounts (including Arrian, Diodorus Siculus and Quintus Curtius Rufus) describe that the burning was the idea of Thaïs, mistress of Alexander&#x27;s general Ptolemy I Soter, and possibly of Alexander himself. She is said to have suggested it during a very drunken celebration, according to some accounts to revenge the destruction of Greek sanctuaries (she was from Athens), and either she or Alexander himself set the fire going.

The &quot;Book of Arda Wiraz&quot;, a Zoroastrian work composed in the 3rd or 4th century, describes Persepolis&#x27; archives as containing &quot;all the Avesta and Zend, written upon prepared cow-skins, and with gold ink&quot;, which were destroyed. Indeed, in his &quot;Chronology of the Ancient Nations&quot;, the native Iranian writer Biruni indicates unavailability of certain native Iranian historiographical sources in the post-Achaemenid era, especially during the Parthian Empire. He adds: &quot;[Alexander] burned the whole of Persepolis as revenge to the Persians, because it seems the Persian King Xerxes had burnt the Greek City of Athens around 150 years ago. People say that, even at the present time, the traces of fire are visible in some places.&quot;

On the upside, the fire that destroyed those texts may have preserved the Persepolis Administrative Archives by preventing them from being lost over time to natural and man-made events. According to archaeological evidence, the partial burning of Persepolis did not damage what are now referred to as the &quot;Persepolis Fortification Archive&quot; tablets, but rather may have caused the eventual collapse of the upper part of the northern fortification wall, preserving the tablets until their recovery by the Oriental Institute&#x27;s archaeologists.

===After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire===

In 316 BC, Persepolis was still the capital of Persia as a province of the great Macedonian Empire (see Diodorus Siculus xix, 21 seq., 46; probably after Hieronymus of Cardia, who was living about 326). The city must have gradually declined in the course of time. The lower city at the foot of the imperial city might have survived for a longer time; but the ruins of the Achaemenids remained as a witness to its ancient glory.

The nearby Estakhr gained prominence as a separate city very shortly after the decline of Persepolis. It appears that much of Persepolis&#x27; rubble was used for the building of Istakhr. At the time of the Muslim invasion of Persia, Estakhr offered a desperate resistance. It was still a place of considerable importance in the first century of Islam, although its greatness was speedily eclipsed by the new metropolis of Shiraz. In the 10th century, Estakhr dwindled to insignificance. During the following centuries, Estakhr gradually declined, until it ceased to exist as a city.

==Archaeological research==

Odoric of Pordenone may have passed through Persepolis on his way to China in 1320, although he mentioned only a great, ruined city called &quot;Comerum&quot;. In 1474, Giosafat Barbaro visited the ruins of Persepolis, which he incorrectly thought were of Jewish origin. &quot;Hakluyt&#x27;s Voyages&quot; included a general account of the ruins of Persepolis attributed to an English merchant who visited Iran in 1568. António de Gouveia from Portugal wrote about cuneiform inscriptions following his visit in 1602. His report on the ruins of Persepolis was published as part of his in 1611.

In 1618, García de Silva Figueroa, King Philip III of Spain&#x27;s ambassador to the court of Abbas I, the Safavid monarch, was the first Western traveler to link the site known in Iran as &quot;Chehel Minar&quot; as the site known from Classical authors as Persepolis.

Pietro Della Valle visited Persepolis in 1621, and noticed that only 25 of the 72 original columns were still standing, due to either vandalism or natural processes. The Dutch traveler Cornelis de Bruijn visited Persepolis in 1704.

The fruitful region was covered with villages until its frightful devastation in the 18th century; and even now it is, comparatively speaking, well cultivated. The Castle of Estakhr played a conspicuous part as a strong fortress, several times, during the Muslim period. It was the middlemost and the highest of the three steep crags which rise from the valley of the Kur, at some distance to the west or northwest of the necropolis of Naqsh-e Rustam.

The French voyagers Eugène Flandin and Pascal Coste are among the first to provide not only a literary review of the structure of Persepolis, but also to create some of the best and earliest visual depictions of its structure. In their publications in Paris, in 1881 and 1882, titled , the authors provided some 350 ground breaking illustrations of Persepolis. French influence and interest in Persia&#x27;s archaeological findings continued after the accession of Reza Shah, when André Godard became the first director of the archeological service of Iran.

In the 1800s, a variety of amateur digging occurred at the site, in some cases on a large scale.

The first scientific excavations at Persepolis were carried out by Ernst Herzfeld and Erich Schmidt representing the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. They conducted excavations for eight seasons, beginning in 1930, and included other nearby sites.
Herzfeld believed that the reasons behind the construction of Persepolis were the need for a majestic atmosphere, a symbol for the empire, and to celebrate special events, especially the &quot;Nowruz&quot;. For historical reasons, Persepolis was built where the Achaemenid dynasty was founded, although it was not the center of the empire at that time.

Excavations of plaque fragments hint at a scene with a contest between Herakles and Apollo, dubbed &quot;A Greek painting at Persepolis&quot;.

===Architecture===
Persepolitan architecture is noted for its use of the Persian column, which was probably based on earlier wooden columns.

The buildings at Persepolis include three general groupings: military quarters, the treasury, and the reception halls and occasional houses for the King. Noted structures include the Great Stairway, the Gate of All Nations, the Apadana, the Hall of a Hundred Columns, the Tripylon Hall and the Tachara, the Hadish Palace, the Palace of Artaxerxes III, the Imperial Treasury, the Royal Stables, and the Chariot House.

==Remains==

Ruins of a number of colossal buildings exist on the terrace. All are constructed of dark-grey marble. Fifteen of their pillars stand intact. Three more pillars have been re-erected since 1970. Several of the buildings were never finished.

Behind the compound at Persepolis, there are three sepulchers hewn out of the rock in the hillside. 
===The Gate of All Nations===

The Gate of All Nations, referring to subjects of the empire, consisted of a grand hall that was a square of approximately in length, with four columns and its entrance on the Western Wall.
===The Apadana Palace===

Darius I built the greatest palace at Persepolis on the western side of platform. This palace was called the &quot;Apadana&quot;. The King of Kings used it for official audiences.

Foundation tablets of gold and silver were found in two deposition boxes in the foundations of the Palace. They contained an inscription by Darius in Old Persian cuneiform, which describes the extent of his Empire in broad geographical terms, and is known as the DPh inscription:

The reliefs on the staircases allow one to observe the people from across the empire in their traditional dress, and even the king himself, &quot;down to the smallest detail&quot;.
====Apadana Palace coin hoard====

The Apadana hoard is a hoard of coins that were discovered under the stone boxes containing the foundation tablets of the Apadana Palace in Persepolis. The coins were discovered in excavations in 1933 by Erich Schmidt, in two deposits, each deposit under the two deposition boxes that were found. The deposition of this hoard is dated to . The coins consisted in eight gold lightweight Croeseids, a tetradrachm of Abdera, a stater of Aegina and three double-sigloi from Cyprus. The Croeseids were found in very fresh condition, confirming that they had been recently minted under Achaemenid rule. The deposit did not have any Darics and Sigloi, which also suggests strongly that these coins typical of Achaemenid coinage only started to be minted later, after the foundation of the Apadana Palace.

===The Throne Hall===

Next to the Apadana, second largest building of the Terrace and the final edifices, is the Throne Hall or the Imperial Army&#x27;s &quot;Hall of Honor&quot; (also called the &quot;Hundred-Columns Palace&quot;). This hall was started by Xerxes I and completed by his son Artaxerxes I by the end of the fifth century BC. Its eight stone doorways are decorated on the south and north with reliefs of throne scenes and on the east and west with scenes depicting the king in combat with monsters. Two colossal stone bulls flank the northern portico. The head of one of the bulls now resides in the Oriental Institute in Chicago and a column base from one of the columns in the British Museum.

At the beginning of the reign of Xerxes I, the Throne Hall was used mainly for receptions for military commanders and representatives of all the subject nations of the empire. Later, the Throne Hall served as an imperial museum.

===The Tachara Palace===
Tachara, was the exclusive palace of Darius the Great at Persepolis. Only a small portion of the palace was finished under his rule, it was completed after the death of Darius in 486 BC, by his son and successor, Xerxes, who called it a Taçara, which means &quot;winter palace&quot; in Old Persian. It was then used by Artaxerxes I. In the 4th century BC, following his invasion of Iran in 330 BC, Alexander the Great allowed his troops to loot Persepolis. This palace was one of the few structures that escaped destruction in the burning of the complex by Alexander&#x27;s army, and because of that, Tachara is the most intact building of Persepolis today. It is also the oldest structure at Persepolis. Tachara stands back to back to the Apadana, and is oriented southward.

===The Hadish Palace===
The Hadish Palace of Xerxes is one of palaces at Persepolis. It&#x27;s located on the east of the Palace of H (Artaxerxes I). The palace occupies the highest level of terrace and stands on the living rock. The inscriptions of the palace attest that the building was built by order of Xerxes. It covers an area of 2550 square meters (40*55 meters). A double staircase on the west leads to courtyard of the Tachara chateau and another staircase on the northeast connects to courtyard of the Council Hall.

===Other palaces and structures===
The Council Hall, the Tryplion Hall, the Palaces of D, G, H, storerooms, stables and quarters, the unfinished gateway and a few miscellaneous structures at Persepolis are located near the south-east corner of the terrace, at the foot of the mountain.
===Tombs===

It is commonly accepted that Cyrus the Great was buried in the Tomb of Cyrus in Pasargadae, which is mentioned by Ctesias as his own city. If it is true that the body of Cambyses II was brought home &quot;to the Persians,&quot; his burying place must be somewhere beside that of his father. Ctesias assumes that it was the custom for a king to prepare his own tomb during his lifetime. Hence, the kings buried at Naghsh-e Rostam are probably Darius I, Xerxes I, Artaxerxes I and Darius II. Xerxes II, who reigned for a very short time, could scarcely have obtained so splendid a monument, and still less could the usurper Sogdianus. The two completed graves behind the compound at Persepolis would then belong to Artaxerxes II and Artaxerxes III. The unfinished tomb, a kilometer away from the city, is debated to who it belongs.

===Ancient texts===

There are a total of 11 existing inscriptions at Persepolis, related to Darius the Great, Xerxes, Artaxerxes II and Artaxerxes III. The relevant passages from ancient scholars on the subject are set out below:


==Modern events==

===2,500-year celebration ===
In 1971, Persepolis was the main staging ground for the &quot;2,500-year celebration of the Persian Empire&quot; under the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the second and last Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty. It included delegations from foreign nations in an attempt to advance the Iranian culture and history.

===The controversy of the Sivand Dam===
Construction of the Sivand Dam, named after the nearby town of Sivand, began on 19 September 2006. Despite 10 years of planning, Iran&#x27;s Cultural Heritage Organization was not aware of the broad areas of flooding during much of this time, and there is growing concern about the effects the dam will have on the surrounding areas of Persepolis. Activists expressed concern that the dam&#x27;s placement between the ruins of Pasargadae and Persepolis will flood both. Engineers involved with the construction deny this claim, stating that it is impossible, because both sites sit well above the planned waterline. Of the two sites, Pasargadae is considered the more threatened.

=== Nowruz Celebrations ===
Every year during Nowruz, a large number of people come to Persepolis to celebrate the new year. In 2024, 10,000 people were at Persepolis when Nowruz started.

=== First concert ===
In a groundbreaking cultural event, Iranian vocalist Alireza Ghorbani performed the first-ever concert at Persepolis from 29 June to 1 July 2024, and received an overwhelmingly enthusiastic response from attendees.

=== Cultural events ===
Various events are held in Persepolis every year, including the Shahnameh reading festival and other cultural events.

=== Conservation issues ===
The site is also threatened by the presence of lichens that have grown on the surface of the monuments, some of which have eroded intricate carvings and motifs. Some of the lichens are estimated to be around 1,700 years old, and their spread has been attributed to industrialisation, acid rain and the extreme desert climate.

==Museums (outside Iran) that display objects from Persepolis==
One bas-relief from Persepolis is in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, England. The largest collection of reliefs is at the British Museum, sourced from multiple British travellers who worked in Iran in the 19th century. The Persepolis bull at the Oriental Institute in Chicago is one of the university&#x27;s most prized treasures, part of the division of finds from the excavations of the 1930s. New York City&#x27;s Metropolitan Museum and Detroit Institute of Art houses objects from Persepolis, as does the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology of the University of Pennsylvania. The Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon and the Louvre of Paris hold objects from Persepolis as well. A bas-relief of a soldier that had been looted from the excavations in 1935–36 and later purchased by the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts was repatriated to Iran in 2018, after being offered for sale in London and New York.

<doc id="92017" wikidata="Q484361" url="?curid=92017" title="Hood River County, Oregon">
<text>Hood River County is one of the 36 counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. As of the 2020 census, the population was 23,977. The county seat is Hood River. The county was established in 1908 and is named for the Hood River, a tributary of the Columbia River. Hood River County comprises the Hood River, OR Micropolitan Statistical Area. The Hood River Valley produces apples, pears, and cherries. Situated between Mount Hood and the Columbia River in the middle of the Columbia River Gorge, Hood River County is a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts, such as windsurfers, mountain-bikers, skiers, hikers, kayakers, and many more.

==History==
The first permanent settlers in present-day Hood River County filed a donation land claim in 1854. The first school was built in 1863 and a road from The Dalles was completed in 1867. By 1880 there were 17 families living in the valley. By the latter part of the nineteenth century farmers of Japanese, Finnish, German, and French ethnicity had settled in the valley.

At the turn of the twentieth century, the people of the Hood River region in the northwest portion of Wasco County expressed a desire for political separation from the parent county. The passage of a statewide initiative established Hood River as the thirty-fourth county of the state. It was made official by a governor&#x27;s proclamation on June 23, 1908. The Columbia River Highway was completed in 1922 from Portland to The Dalles, improving access between both those cities as well as to Hood River.

In response to controversy surrounding county approval of locating a destination resort at Cooper Spur ski area on Mount Hood, on November 5, 2003, 62% of the voters approved a measure requiring voter approval on residential developments of 25 units or more on land zoned for forest use. Opponents claimed that this measure was not enforceable and would end up in court.

==Geography==
Hood River County is , of which is land and (2.1%) is water. It is the second-smallest county in Oregon by area. Elevation ranges from above sea level at Cascade Locks in the northwest to at the summit of Mount Hood, the highest point in Oregon.

The County lies in a transition zone in the Columbia River Gorge between the temperate rain forest of the Cascade range and dry desert of eastern Oregon. Precipitation varies considerably by longitude and elevation. Annual precipitation averages over 76 inches in Cascade Locks, but is less than 31 inches in the City of Hood River. At the highest reaches of the County on Mount Hood precipitation can be up to 150 inches annually.

The Gorge can have a moderating effect on air temperatures in the County near the Columbia River when maritime air moves in from the west. Major easterly flows, however, can occasionally cause extreme cold conditions as cold air moves west through the Gorge. Winds are generally from the west in the summer, resulting in strong and consistent winds on the Columbia River at Hood River County, making Hood River a world-renowned wind surfing location. Winter winds can blow from either the east or the west and can be of sufficient force to result in widespread damage.

Hood River County contains the entirety of the Hood River watershed, which covers nearly two-thirds of the county. This watershed includes four main sub-basins: the West Fork Hood River, the Middle Fork Hood River, the East Fork Hood River, and the Hood River Mainstem (the lower river and its tributaries).

Sixty percent, or , of the county is federal land managed by the Mount Hood National Forest. Another , or 8.8 percent, is forestland owned and managed by Hood River County. The State of Oregon owns within the county. Weyerhaeuser Company became a major private landowner in 2013 after purchasing Longview Timber LLC, including its forest holdings in Hood River County. , over seven percent of the county, is managed as private farmland. As of 2012 there were 554 farms, with a medium farm size of .

==Government and infrastructure==
Hood River is a home rule county with an administrative style of government. The county is governed by an elected board of five commissioners. Four commissioners are elected from four geographic districts, and the chair is elected at large.

The county operates two campgrounds at Toll Bridge Park and Tucker Park. The Forestry Department manages the 31,000 acre County Forest for timber sale revenue and to develop and maintain recreation trails. In fiscal year 2014 gross revenue from County timber sales was $3,851,646 while Forestry Department expenses where $1,049,648. Property taxes generated $3,071,038 in revenue in the same year.

The Northern Oregon Regional Corrections Facility (Norcor), a short-term jail, serves Hood River, Gilliam, Sherman, and Wasco counties.

Hood River County is currently one of 11 counties in Oregon in which therapeutic psilocybin is legal.

===Presidential and statewide elections===
Hood River County is a reliable state bellwether, having voted for Oregon&#x27;s statewide winner in every presidential election since 1948, along with Benton County. The county can be considered an outlier among other rural counties in the state and across the nation, partly due to its close proximity to Portland. 

Starting in 1988, Hood River County has become one of Oregon’s most reliably Democratic strongholds, supporting Democratic candidates for president and for statewide office often by wide margins.
In the Oregon House of Representatives, Hood River County is included in the 52nd House District, represented by Jeff Helfrich. In the Oregon State Senate, it is located within the 26th Senate District, which is represented by Daniel Bonham. Both Helfrich and Bonham are registered Republicans.












==Economy==
Health Care and Social Assistance was the largest major NAICS industry sector in Hood River County in 2013, with 14 percent of earnings. Manufacturing, at 12 percent, was the second largest sector. Farm Earnings combined with Forestry, Fishing and Related Activities represented nearly 11 percent of earnings. The Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services sector, while accounting for seven percent of earnings in 2013, was the fastest growing sector between 2002 and 2013, growing at an average annual rate of over 11 percent, and increasing its relative share of total earnings by 6.45 percent. Earnings in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector grew at an average of over five percent per year during that period.

Despite a relatively small share of total earnings, farming, forestry and tourism are all important economic drivers in Hood River County. In 2013, Farm Earnings and Forestry, Fishing and Related Activities had location quotients of 8.57 percent and 12.09 percent, respectively, indicating an outsized concentration of these sectors within the county. The Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation industry, while comprising less than four percent of total earnings, had a location quotient of 3.27 percent, the highest of any county in the State of Oregon, indicating a highly concentrated tourism sector.

Agriculture, timber, lumber and recreation are important sources of revenue and industry. Fruit grown in the fertile valley is of such exceptional quality the county leads the world in Anjou pear production. A 1997 census recorded of commercial orchards growing pears, apples, cherries and peaches. Hood River County also has two ports and two boat basins, one serving local barge traffic, a steel boat manufacturing firm and Mid-Columbia yachting interests.

The Columbia River, which runs right by the city of Hood River, has become a premier windsurfing destination, attracting windsurfers from throughout the United States and around the world. Cool, moist coastal air is drawn through the Columbia River Gorge as the desert to the east heats up on warm days, creating winds between 15 and 35 knots most days in the summer. With the current in the Columbia River flowing from east to west, and the wind blowing from west to east, large swells are created on the river that windsurfers enjoy riding like waves. Windsurfing has affected the local economy in many ways: windsurfing-oriented businesses and upscale restaurants catering to visiting windsurfers have reinvigorated the downtown area, many people who first visited Hood River in search of wind and waves have settled in the area and become an integral part of the community, and the local economy has been infused with much needed tourist dollars.

The Mount Hood Railroad provides freight service, connecting with the Union Pacific at Hood River, Oregon, and operates excursion trains and dinner trains on a rail line running from Hood River to Parkdale. The line was completed in 1909, and operated as an independent company until acquired by Union Pacific Railroad in 1968. In 1987 a local group of investors purchased the line for $600,000, naming it the Mount Hood Railroad. In 2008 Mount Hood Railroad was acquired by Iowa Pacific Holdings, based in Chicago. The company leases storage on its lines for excess freight cars, in addition to, or at times in place of, operating recreational rides.

<doc id="92018" wikidata="Q484367" url="?curid=92018" title="Harney County, Oregon">
<text>Harney County is one of the 36 counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. As of the 2020 census, the population was 7,495, making it the sixth-least populous county in Oregon. The county seat is Burns. Established in 1889, the county is named in honor of William S. Harney, a military officer of the period, who was involved in the Pig War and popular in the Pacific Northwest.

Harney County is a rural county in southeastern Oregon. It is a five-hour drive from Portland, Oregon and a three-hour drive from Boise, Idaho. The county is bordered by Grant County (to the north), Malheur County (to the east); Washoe County, Nevada and Humboldt County, Nevada (to the south); and Lake, Deschutes, and Crook counties (to the west).

At in size, the county is the largest in Oregon, and one of the largest in the United States; it is larger in area than six U.S. states. The county is the most sparsely populated in Oregon, with a population density of . The county has just two incorporated cities: Burns, the county seat and the larger city, with 40 percent of the population, and Hines, with 20 percent of the county&#x27;s population. About 75 percent of the county&#x27;s area is federal land, variously managed by the Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Forest Service. About 10 percent of Harney County&#x27;s area is part of the Ochoco National Forest and Malheur National Forest. The county also contains the Burns Paiute Indian Reservation within and immediately north of the City of Burns; this 760-acres reservation of the Burns Paiute Tribe is a remnant of the former Malheur Indian Reservation.

Harney County has a &quot;high desert&quot; topography, with low levels of precipitation. About 500 ranches and farms producing cattle, dairy products and hay operate within the county; in the county, cattle outnumber people 14-to-1. Besides ranching and farming, forestry evolves important industries in the county.

The county is of ecological as well as recreational importance. Along with neighboring Grant County, Harney County has the nation&#x27;s largest Ponderosa pine forest. The county was also a focus of recent efforts to conserve the sage grouse; in 2014, Harney County ranchers signed 30-year agreements with the federal government to protect the sage grouse. Visitors are attracted to the county for its hunting, fishing, and camping activities.

According to the website of the Harney County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, the sheriff has a staff of six law enforcement officers. Burns has a separate police department but, as of 2008, did not employ enough officers to provide &quot;24-hour&quot; coverage.

==History==
The Native Americans living in this region at the time of the Lewis and Clark Expedition were the Northern Paiute, who fought with the Tenino and Wasco peoples. Peter Skene Ogden was the first known European to explore this area in 1826 when he led a fur brigade for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. 

In September 3, 1855 Brigadier General Harney led the U.S. Army and surrounded and ambushed a Lakota village killing 86 people and taking many others as prisoners. This site, located in Nebraska, is now known as the Blue Water Massacre or the Battle of Ash Hollow. 

Harney County was carved out of the southern two-thirds of Grant County on February 25, 1889. A fierce political battle, with armed &quot;night riders&quot; who spirited county records from Harney to Burns, ended with Burns as the county seat in 1890.

The Malheur River Indian Reservation was created by executive order on March 14, 1871, and the Northern Paiute within the Oregon state boundaries were settled there. The federal government &quot;discontinued&quot; the reservation after the Bannock War of 1878. Descendants of these people form a federally recognized tribal entity, the Burns Paiute Tribe, which had 341 members in 2008. Fewer than 35.5% of the tribal members live on the Burns Paiute Indian Colony near Burns. The tribe formerly earned revenue from a small casino, the Old Camp Casino, before its closure in 2012, and renting out communal tribal lands for grazing rights to local ranchers.

The first white people to arrive through Harney County were French explorers, circa 1750ː Narceese Charbonneau (father of Toussaint Charbonneau), LaValle and a priest named Joseph Nadeau. The men came aboard a Spanish supply ship and left from San Diego on a transcontinental tour to Quebec. Instead of reaching Canada, the men arrived at southern Harney County and continued towards Idaho. In the late 1820s, Peter Skene Ogden made a description of the natural features and Indian culture from Klamath County to Harney County, following the Sylvaille River, and turning up afterwards towards Walla Walla leading a fur brigade for Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company.

===2016 militia occupation===

On January 2, 2016, the headquarters building of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge was seized by armed protesters related to the Bundy standoff. The group protested the prison sentences of two ranchers convicted of arson in wildfires set in 2001 and 2006, which the ranchers claimed spread from their land into the wildlife reserve. Militia leaders, including Ammon Bundy and Jon Ritzheimer, were arrested on January 26, 2016, in an event that included the shooting death of militant LaVoy Finicum by law enforcement at a highway blockade between Burns and John Day. The following day, only four militants remained, and they surrendered on February 11, 2016.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.9%) is water. It is the largest county in Oregon by area and the tenth-largest county in the United States (excluding boroughs and census areas in Alaska).

Steens Mountain is the county&#x27;s most prominent geographical feature, rising to above sea level and spanning many miles across a region that is otherwise fairly flat. To its southeast is the Alvord Desert—the driest place in Oregon—and the Trout Creek Mountains, which extend south into Nevada. South of Steens Mountain, the Pueblo Mountains are another remote range in Oregon and Nevada. North of Steens Mountain lies the Harney Basin, which contains Malheur Lake and Harney Lake.

==Economy==
Three industries have traditionally provided the county&#x27;s economic base: ranching, sheep raising, and timber. The railroad, which extended into the area in 1883, served as a catalyst to the cattle industry but later contributed to its decline. By bringing farmers and sheep men to the area, it created increased competition for productive land. Harvesting and breeding of wild horses was lucrative for a period. Harney County shares the largest Ponderosa Pine forest in the nation with Grant County. Its abundance of game, numerous campsites and excellent fishing have stimulated fast-growing recreational activities.

Although county lands were open to homesteading from 1862 to 1934, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management still owns more than , or 62%, of the lands within the county boundaries. Facilitated on the national level by the Carey act of 1894, arid land in Harney County was donated to the state for irrigation and settlement, but all water development efforts failed.

Eventually all land claims filed under the reclamation legislation were abandoned or nullified. Malheur National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1908 and expanded in 1936. The refuge now includes . Borax has been mined in the Steens area, and uranium has been found on its south side.

<text>Grant County is one of the 36 counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. As of the 2020 census, the population was 7,233, making it Oregon&#x27;s fourth-least populous county. The county seat is Canyon City. It is named for President Ulysses S. Grant, who served as an army officer in the Oregon Territory, and at the time of the county&#x27;s creation was a Union general in the American Civil War. Grant County is included in the eight-county definition of Eastern Oregon.

==History==

Grant County was established on October 14, 1864, from parts of old Wasco and old Umatilla counties. Prior to its creation, cases brought to court were tried in The Dalles, county seat of the vast Wasco County. The great distance to The Dalles made law enforcement a difficult problem, and imposed a heavy burden on citizens who had a need to transact business at the courthouse. In 1889, more than half of the southern part of the original Grant County was taken to form Harney County. Also in 1899, a small part of northwestern Grant County was taken (along with parts of Crook and Gilliam counties) to form Wheeler County.

After gold was discovered in 1862 on Whiskey Flat, it has been estimated that within ten days 1,000 miners were camped along Canyon Creek. This increased population created a need for county government. Grant County&#x27;s government operates in accordance with the Oregon Constitution which was ratified by the People of Oregon in November 1857, and the revised Statutes of Oregon. It employs the old-western county government system: the County Court, with a County Judge and two Commissioners. While the County Court no longer exercises much judicial authority, it serves as the executive branch of county government.

The third man to serve as County Judge of Grant County was Cincinnatus Hiner &quot;Joaquin&quot; Miller (1837–1913), the noted poet, playwright, and western naturalist, called the &quot;Poet of the Sierras&quot; and the &quot;Byron of the Rockies.&quot;

The county seat is Canyon City, which served as the chief community of the county for many years. In 1864, when the county was organized, Canyon City is said to have boasted the largest population of any community in Oregon. Mining and ranching, along with timber and then the service and public works that followed, brought people into the area and communities grew around the natural centers of industry and agriculture. Canyon City hosts an annual summer festival called &quot;&#x27;62 Days&quot; (referencing the local gold discovery in 1862) to celebrate its history and residents.

Since the 1930s, the city of John Day has served as the main economic center of the county, and boasts the largest population.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.02%) is water.

Approximately 63% of the land area of the county is controlled by the Federal Government, most of which is controlled by the U.S. Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management. Grant County contains most of the Malheur National Forest and sections of the Wallowa–Whitman, Umatilla and Ochoco National Forests, and has more than of federally designated Wilderness Areas.

Grant County contains the headwaters of the John Day River, which has more miles of Wild and Scenic River designation than any other river in the United States.

The elevation of the county varies from 1,820 on the John Day River near Kimberly, to at the summit of Strawberry Mountain. The terrain of the county varies from grassland steppes and rangelands in relatively open or rolling hills and valleys, to steep, rugged, rocky high-alpine landscapes. Between these, the county contains heavily timbered land, many rolling hills, canyons and mountainous terrain. Portions of the county are technically high desert, dominated by sagebrush and sparse grasses.

Grant County includes the southern part of the Blue Mountains. One unique characteristic of the typical forestland of the area is the relatively low density of underbrush. Travelers and emigrants of the 19th century remarked that the absences of underbrush, and the wide spacing of the trees, made it possible to drive a wagon and team of horses virtually anywhere the grade would permit. The forested land of the county vary from sparse stands of Western Juniper in more arid, open, or rocky ground, to spruce-fir stands in the highest terrain. Other forested areas (mainly above in elevation) are marked by stands of Ponderosa Pine, Douglas-fir, hybrid Grand x White Fir, Western Larch and Lodgepole Pine. At high elevations there are stands of Engelmann Spruce, Subalpine Fir, and Whitebark Pine, as well as a few stands of Western White Pine. Cottonwoods grow along some rivers and streams, and there are small groves of birch and Quaking Aspen at higher elevations. There is also a rare and isolated stand of Alaska Yellow Cedar in the Aldrich Mountains. Other flora includes a wide variety of native grasses and wildflowers, huckleberries, wild strawberries, elderberries, several types of edible mushrooms and Oregon-grape, the state plant. Non-native Cheatgrass is also prevalent in many areas of the county.

Grant County is also home to what may be one of the largest living organism in the world, a giant fungus of the species &quot;Armillaria solidipes&quot; that lives within the Malheur National Forest. It was found to span . Its total mass has been estimated to be between 8,500 and 10,500 tons, and its age at somewhere between 2,000 and 8,500 years.

The physical terrain one encounters today is far different than in prehistoric times. Fossil records show that, in the Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras, much of the county was an ancient seabed. After emerging, the absence of the Cascade Mountains allowed the region to experience a relatively wet temperate climate. Ancient Tertiary rivers flowed through the area on courses that would be impossible today. During the Cenozoic Era, volcanic activity and extensive lava flows in the region dramatically changed the landscape. The John Day Fault (one of the only major faults in North America to run east–west) runs along the southern edge of the John Day Valley, caused an uplift, forming the Strawberry and Aldrich mountain ranges and the northern boundary of the Great Basin. Relatively recently in geological terms, during the last Ice age and shortly thereafter, large lakes were present in southeastern Oregon. Continual glaciers were still clinging to mountains in the area in the late 19th century, and one small glacier on Strawberry Mountain often remains year-round.

The geology of Grant County is rich, including one of the largest fossil concentrations in North America: The John Day Fossil Beds, which the U.S. Congress designated as a National Monument in 1974. Valuable metals, including gold, silver, platinum group elements, chrome, copper and cobalt, are found in the region. It was this mineral wealth, and the development of gold mines in particular, that spurred the permanent settlement of the area. Large zones of serpentine, a metamorphic rock, dating from the Triassic period, are found in numerous locations. Strawberry Mountain (an extinct volcano), the granite peaks and boulders of the Elkhorn Mountains, and numerous rim rocks, lava flows and basalt outcrops are evidence of the historic volcanic activity in the region. Hydrothermal resources are still present, with a number of hot and warm springs.

The remnants of ferns, semi-tropical and temperate deciduous forests, shellfish, saber-toothed cats, extinct horse and camel species, and giant sloth, among other extinct species found in the John Day Fossil Beds, are a reminder that the flora and fauna of the region has changed significantly over the millennia. While deer, elk, pronghorn, cougar, bear and upland game bird populations thrive today, some of these animals were remarkably scarce 200 years ago. Explorers and trappers traveling through the region in the early 19th century remarked on the scarcity of game animals and their ability (or inability, as the case were) to find food.

Native fish in the region include several trout species; warm water fish such as bass and perch are found in the lower John Day River; and migratory salmon and steelhead are found in the county seasonally. While salmon and steelhead returns to the John Day Basin experienced a sharp decline during the past 50 years, mainly due to the construction of large dams on the Columbia River, the major watercourses of John Day Basin remain free of physical obstructions, and the numbers of returning salmon and steelhead have improved in recent years, marking some of the best fish runs recorded in the past half-century.
Most of Grant County is drained by the four forks of the John Day River, all of which have their headwaters in the county. The John Day River system drains some . It is the third longest free-flowing river in the &quot;lower 48&quot; and has more miles of federal &quot;Wild and Scenic River&quot; designation than any other river in the United States. The river system in Grant County includes the upper of the Main Stem, all of the of the North Fork, all of the Middle Fork, and all of the South Fork of the John Day River. From Grant County, the lower John Day River flows another to its confluence with the Columbia River. The southeastern corner of the county includes the headwaters of the Malheur and Little Malheur rivers, which find their way to the Snake River. The southern part of Grant County includes the northernmost reaches of the Great Basin, including the Silvies River watershed, which flows south into Harney Lake in the High Desert of Eastern Oregon. A small area in the southwestern corner of Grant County is in the Crooked River and Deschutes River watersheds.

Grant County is an arid to temperate region, with average annual precipitation ranging from near Picture Gorge, to over in the Strawberry Mountains. Annual precipitation in the valleys averages between 12 and , while the uplands or highlands of the county average between 16 and . Grant County averages between 40 and 60 days each year that see more than of precipitation. A great deal of the county&#x27;s precipitation comes in the form of winter snow in the mountains. This snow pack is vital to recharge aquifers, resulting in spring run-off, and in-stream flows of water throughout the year.

Average temperatures in the county range from the warmest community, Monument, with average daily highs/lows of 90°/50 °F in July and 42°/22 °F in January; to the coolest community, Seneca, with average daily highs/lows of 80°/38 °F in July and 33°/8 °F in January. Extreme temperatures in the county show 30-year highs/lows of: 103°/-37 °F at Austin; 112°/-23 °F at John Day; 108°/-25 °F at Long Creek; 112°/-26 °F at Monument; and 100°/-48 °F at Seneca.

Grant County has an estimated 200 days of clear sunny or mostly sunny days, or an estimated 300 days of clear sunny, mostly sunny, or partly sunny days each year. The county experiences an estimated 65 days of overcast skies, with about 165 days of partly to mostly cloudy days annually.

==Politics==

Like the other counties in eastern Oregon, the majority of registered voters who are affiliated with a political party in Grant County are members of the Republican Party. George W. Bush&#x27;s performance here in 2000 marked the strongest of any Republican in the county, carrying just over 80% of Grant&#x27;s votes in it. In the 2008 presidential election, 70.97% of Grant County voters voted for Republican John McCain, while 26.05% voted for Democrat Barack Obama and 3.94% of voters either voted for a Third Party candidate or wrote in a candidate. These numbers show a small but definite shift towards the Democratic candidate when compared to the 2004 presidential election, in which 78.9% of Grant County voters voted for George W. Bush, while 19.2% voted for John Kerry, and 1.9% of voters either voted for a Third Party candidate or wrote in a candidate. The 2008 presidential election, however, was the last time a Democratic nominee won over 1,000 votes in the county.

In the 2020 election, the county had shifted back to the Republican candidate Donald Trump, who received 77.28% of the votes, compared to Joe Biden&#x27;s share of 20.17%. The remaining 2.55% of voters chose either a Third Party candidate or wrote in a candidate.













==Economy==

With the discovery of gold near Canyon City in June 1862, and near Granite in July 1862, gold miners streamed into the area. The eminent geologist, Waldemar Lindgren, who visited the area in 1900, estimated that approximately $16 million in gold had been mined from the Canyon City area alone by that time. (In 1900, the value of gold was fixed at $20.67 per ounce, so that $16 million in gold would have been roughly 800,000 ounces—worth today [at $1,600 an ounce] about $1.28 Billion) Mining remained the dominant sector of the area&#x27;s economy, with increasing lode-ore production annually, until October 1942 when the U. S. War Labor Board made gold mining illegal by Executive Order, Public Law L-208. This effectively led to several mining towns being abandoned and the demise of the mining industry in eastern Oregon and elsewhere; idle equipment was removed as scrap drives during World War II literally dismantled a great deal of the county&#x27;s mining infrastructure. In Oregon, Grant County&#x27;s gold production was second only to Baker County.

Because of the wealth of natural resources found in Grant County, agriculture, ranching, and timber industries naturally grew with and contributed to the development of the county. In the early days, sheep formed a large part of the agricultural base and the area boasted some of the largest sheep bands in the world, supplying a great volume of wool to, among others, the world-renowned Pendleton Wool Works in Pendleton. Cattle ranchers and sheep ranchers were often at odds and physical confrontations were not uncommon. By the 1920 and 1930s, however, cattle ranching became—and continues to be—the dominant sector of the agricultural industry. Crop farming, dairy production and orchards operated on small scales during the late 19th century and early 20th century, but declined during World War II due to changing market and labor pressures. The commercial timber industry in Grant County grew rapidly in the 1920s, and again during and after World War II. Livestock raising and timber harvesting remain important sectors of Grant County&#x27;s economy, although the production and profitability of these industries has declined in recent years due mainly to political and expanding-market factors. Two wood-fired co-gen electric plants have been built in the county, one of which continues to operate in Prairie City.

Due mainly to federal land management policies and global market pressures affecting timber and agricultural production and extraction, the county has experienced the second highest unemployment rate in Oregon for more than 30 years. The county has experienced some growth in recreational activities (including hunting) and tourism, as well as cottage industry, but residents have struggled to develop new productive industries and to diversify their economy. Slightly more than a quarter of the county&#x27;s workforce is employed by some level of government or public services.

<text>Gilliam County is one of the 36 counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. As of the 2020 census, the population was 1,995, making it the third-least populous county in Oregon. The county seat is Condon. The county was established in 1885 and is named for Cornelius Gilliam, a colonel who commanded the forces of the provisional government of Oregon after the Whitman Massacre.

==History==

The Oregon Legislative Assembly created Gilliam County on February 25, 1885, from the eastern third of Wasco County after residents complained that they were too far from their county seat in The Dalles. The first Gilliam county seat was at Alkali, now Arlington. The question of a permanent county seat was placed on general election ballots in 1886, 1888, and again in 1890, when voters chose to move the county seat to Condon, known to early settlers as &quot;Summit Springs.&quot; Once the question of the location of the county seat was settled, voters in Gilliam County proved reluctant to provide a courthouse in Condon. The county government operated out of a two-room house until 1903, when the county court appropriated money to construct a courthouse. This courthouse burned down in 1954 and was replaced the following year with the current courthouse.

The Shepherds Flat Wind Farm, an 845 megawatt (MW) wind farm, began construction near Arlington in 2009, shortly after approval by state regulators. The wind farm was being built by Caithness Energy using General Electric (GE) 2.5 MW wind turbines, and it will supply electricity to Southern California Edison. In April 2011, Google announced they had invested $100 million in the project. The wind farm was estimated to have an economic impact of $16 million annually for Oregon.

==Geography==
Gilliam County is located in the central northern part of Oregon, east of the Cascade Range. While its southern and eastern borders are defined by its neighboring counties, its western border is defined by the John Day River and its northern border is defined by the Columbia River. Most of the county is mostly flat, but contains various canyons created by streams from the Blue Mountains.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.5%) is water.

==Government and infrastructure==
The Northern Oregon Regional Corrections Facility (Norcor), a short-term jail, serves Gilliam, Hood River, Sherman, and Wasco counties.
==Politics==

Though Gilliam County is located in central Oregon, politically it falls in line with the eastern side of the state. The majority of registered voters who are part of a political party in Gilliam County, as well as most counties in eastern Oregon, are members of the Republican Party. The last time a Democrat carried a clear majority of the votes in Gilliam was in 1964 with Lyndon Johnson, though Bill Clinton was able to win it by a plurality in 1996 and had lost it by just three votes in 1992. In the 2008 presidential election, 58.36% of Gilliam County voters voted for Republican John McCain, while 38.74% voted for Democrat Barack Obama and 2.88% of voters either voted for a Third Party candidate or wrote in a candidate. These numbers show a small but clear shift towards the Democratic candidate when compared to the 2004 presidential election, in which 66.3% of Gilliam Country voters voted for George W. Bush, while 32.5% voted for John Kerry, and 1.2% of voters either voted for a third-party candidate or wrote in a candidate.

Despite its Republican lean, Gilliam County has still been willing to vote for Democrats at the state level; for example, Senator Ron Wyden won the county in the 1998, 2004, 2010, and 2016 elections. This streak, however, ended in 2022 when Republican Jo Rae Perkins won most of the county&#x27;s votes.











==Economy==

Gilliam County is in the heart of the Columbia River Plateau wheat-growing region. The economy is based on agriculture, and wheat, barley and beef cattle are the principal products. Properties are large, with an average farm size of about .

The largest individual employers in the county are two subsidiaries of Waste Management Inc., Chemical Waste Management of the Northwest and Oregon Waste Systems, Inc., who run two regional waste disposal landfills. By levying a fee of $1 a ton, Gilliam County receives enough money to pay the first $500 of the property tax bills of its inhabitants, an amount that covers the full tax bill for almost half of the county inhabitants, as well as funding other county projects.

Hunting, fishing and tourism are secondary industries. Transportation also contributes to the local economy; two major rivers, the John Day and Columbia, cross the area east-to-west, as does Interstate 84. Oregon Route 19 connects the county&#x27;s major cities north-to-south and provides access to the John Day Valley.

<doc id="92022" wikidata="Q484395" url="?curid=92022" title="Douglas County, Oregon">
<text>Douglas County is one of the 36 counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. As of the 2020 census, the population was 111,201. The county seat is Roseburg. The county is named after Stephen A. Douglas, an American politician who supported Oregon statehood. Douglas County comprises the Roseburg, OR Micropolitan Statistical Area. In regards to area, Douglas County is the largest county west of the Oregon Cascades.

==History==
The area originally was inhabited by the Umpqua Indians, a grouping of natives who spoke a variety of Penutian and Athabaskan languages. Following the Rogue River Indian War in 1856, most of the remaining natives were moved by the government to the Grand Ronde Indian Reservation. However, seven families of Umpqua hid in the hills, eluding capture for many decades. They are now federally recognized as the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians. The tribe manages a small reservation in Canyonville, Oregon, and has a Casino/Hotel named Seven Feathers to represent the seven families who refused forced removal to the Grand Ronde Reservation.

Douglas County was created on January 7, 1852, from the portion of Umpqua County which lay east of the Coast Range summit. In 1856 the Camas Valley was annexed to Douglas County from Coos County. In 1862, the rest of Umpqua county was absorbed into Douglas County, some say due to the loss of population following the end of the early gold boom, while others attribute the absorption to politics. Further boundary adjustments were made with Jackson and Lane Counties in 1915. The borders of Douglas County are largely defined by the Umpqua River watershed.

In 2017, after the defeat of a referendum, the Douglas County Library System ceased operations and all public libraries in the county were closed. Subsequently, 10 of the cities reopened their libraries to continue serving their communities.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.9%) is water. It is the fifth-largest county in Oregon by area. A portion of the Umpqua National Forest is in Douglas County. Douglas County is one of two Oregon counties that extend from the Pacific Ocean to the Cascade Range. (The other is Lane County.)

===Airports===

==Politics==
In contrast to the Willamette Valley, Douglas County is powerfully conservative and Republican, being akin to Josephine County to the south, or to Eastern Oregon. No Democratic presidential nominee has carried Douglas County since Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s landslide win in 1964: indeed the last Democrat to crack forty percent of the county&#x27;s vote was Michael Dukakis in 1988 during an election influenced by a major drought. Historically, the county, like all of Western Oregon north of the Rogue Valley, also leaned strongly Republican: before 1964 the only other Democrats to carry Douglas County had been John F. Kennedy in 1960, Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1936 and 1932, Woodrow Wilson in 1912 and William Jennings Bryan in 1896.

Douglas County is split between the highly conservative 2nd congressional district, represented by Cliff Bentz, and the liberal-leaning 4th district, which includes the Democratic stronghold of Eugene and has been represented by Democrat Val Hoyle since 2023. Within the Oregon House of Representatives, Douglas County is split between four districts. The coastal part, including Reedsport, lies within the 9th District represented by Republican Boomer Wright. A belt from Roseburg south lies in the 4th District, which extends into Jackson and Josephine counties, is represented by Republican Christine Goodwin. The far southwest adjacent to Curry and Coos counties is within the 1st District represented by Republican Court Boice, and the bulk of the county, centered on the northeastern half, lies in the 2nd District represented by Republican Virgle Osborne.

In the Oregon State Senate, Douglas County is split between three districts. The coastal part (9th House of Representatives District) lies within the 5th Senate District represented by Republican Dick Anderson. The two southwestern State House Districts (1st and 2nd) are part of the 1st Senate District represented by Republican David Brock Smith. The southernmost portion of Douglas County exists within the state&#x27;s 2nd Senate District, represented by Republican Art Robinson.

In spite of its conservative reputation, Douglas County voters have rejected two secessionist proposals to join the Greater Idaho coalition. An initial effort in November of 2020 failed on a vote of 56.68% in opposition to 43.32% in support. A second effort in May of 2022 was also rejected on a vote of 52.63% in opposition to 47.37% in support. This came despite the county, in 2020, giving 67.29% of its votes to Donald Trump and 29.78% of its votes to Joe Biden. 













==Economy==
Almost the entire watershed of the Umpqua River lies within the boundaries of Douglas County. The heavily timbered county contains nearly of commercial forest lands and one of the oldest stands of old growth timber in the world. Approximately 25–30% of the labor force is employed in the forest products industry. Agriculture, mainly field crops, orchards, and livestock (particularly sheep ranching), is also important to the economy of the county. The land of Douglas County is roughly half-publicly and half-privately owned.

The post-Prohibition wine industry in Oregon began with Richard Somer planting Hillcrest Vineyard at the south end of the Umpqua Valley in 1961. The Umpqua Valley wine appellation lies entirely within Douglas county.

Nickel has been refined at Riddle since 1954. There is a significant federal presence in the region; the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management administer more than 50% of the county&#x27;s land.

As of 2015, the top ten private employers in the county were:

<text>Interstate 44 (I-44) is an Interstate Highway in the central United States. Although it is nominally an east–west road as it is even-numbered, it follows a more southwest–northeast alignment. Its western terminus is in Wichita Falls, Texas, at a concurrency with U.S. Route 277 (US 277), US 281, and US 287; its eastern terminus is at I-70 in St. Louis, Missouri. I-44 is one of five Interstates built to bypass US 66; this highway covers the section between Oklahoma City and St. Louis. Virtually the entire length of I-44 east of Springfield, Missouri, was once US 66, which was upgraded from two to four lanes from 1949 to 1955. The section of I-44 west of Springfield was built farther south than US 66 in order to connect Missouri&#x27;s section with the already completed Will Rogers Turnpike, which Oklahoma wished to carry their part of I-44.

===Texas===

In the US state of Texas, I-44 has a short, but regionally important, stretch, connecting Wichita Falls with Oklahoma. The route runs almost due north to the Texas–Oklahoma state line at the Red River. In Wichita Falls, I-44 runs concurrently with US 277, US 281, and US 287 and is known locally as the &quot;Central Freeway&quot;. I-44 provides access to downtown Wichita Falls and Sheppard Air Force Base.

===Oklahoma===
I-44 in Oklahoma is mostly three separate toll roads; it is paralleled by former US 66 from Oklahoma City to the Missouri state line. In southwestern Oklahoma, I-44 is the H. E. Bailey Turnpike and it runs northeast–southwest (and vice-versa). In the Oklahoma City area, I-44 is either six or eight lanes; it runs concurrent with I-35 for about in Oklahoma City. From Oklahoma City, I-44 runs northeast–southwest as the Turner Turnpike towards Tulsa. After I-44 leaves Tulsa, it becomes the Will Rogers Turnpike to the Missouri state line.

===Missouri===

I-44 enters Missouri southwest of Joplin near the tripoint of Oklahoma, Missouri, and Kansas. It misses the Kansas border by less than . The first exit in Missouri is for US 166. I-44 continues through the southern part of Joplin, where it runs concurrently with the new Missouri segment of I-49. East of Joplin, I-49 splits off on its own alignment to Kansas City.

I-44 then continues east on the former US 166 to Mount Vernon. At the northeast part of Mount Vernon, I-44 heads northeast, while old US 166 continued east on Route 174. The section of road to Halltown is a completely new road, not bypassing any previous highways. At Halltown, the road follows the general pathway of US 66 all the way to downtown St. Louis.
I-44 passes through Springfield on the north side of the city and continues northeast. At Waynesville, I-44 enters a very hilly and curvy area until it passes Rolla. Although the road still passes through some hilly areas, none are as steep as that particular stretch.

At Pacific, I-44 widens to six lanes, later to eight lanes. The Interstate passes through the suburbs of St. Louis and then into downtown St. Louis, passing the Gateway Arch before finally terminating near the Mississippi River, continuing from there as I-70 from the west end of the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge. Until a future second span of the new bridge is completed, there will be no way for I-44 traffic to utilize the new Stan Musial Veterans Memorial span without first exiting to surface streets. I-44 traffic wishing to continue northeast and east must use the Poplar Street Bridge and I-55/I-64 to cross the Mississippi River.

At some places, an &quot;Alternate I-44&quot; is posted. One such ran between Rolla and Springfield via US 60 and US 63, and another ran via US 63 and US 50 between Rolla and Union. These were completed to provide traffic relief during road work. The latter of these alternate routes detoured traffic around three-hour delays due to road work near Cuba. 

==History==
I-44 was originally signed in 1958 as an Interstate designation of the Turner Turnpike linking Oklahoma City and Tulsa and the Will Rogers Turnpike linking Tulsa and the Missouri state line southwest of Joplin, along with the US 66 bypass in Tulsa that linked that city with the two turnpikes and the continued four-lane highway from the Missouri border to an interchange with US 71 south of Joplin previously designated as US 166.

As US 66 was being bypassed by I-44, the Route 66 Association requested the designation Interstate 66 for I-44 from St. Louis to Oklahoma City; The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) rejected the request.

At the time the I-44 designation was assigned in Oklahoma in the 1950s, Oklahoma signed the milemarkers west to east starting at Turner Turnpike&#x27;s Oklahoma City terminus at the I-44/I-35 interchange (near Edmond). I-44 was extended in 1982 southwest of Oklahoma City along the existing H. E. Bailey Turnpike, thus raising the milemarkers by about 100. The addition of the new section was unusual in that it is a more north–south segment and did not directly connect to the previous western end at I-35. It now extends south of I-40, an exception to the Interstate numbering rules and its end point does not connect to another Interstate Highway.

What was once I-244 around St. Louis is currently part of that city&#x27;s I-270/I-255 beltway.

During the historic 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak, an F5 tornado crossed I-44. This particular tornado had the fastest tornado wind speeds on record. The interstate was severely damaged where the tornado crossed it. In the end, this tornado was blamed for 36 deaths.

A section of I-44 was moved slightly north between Powellville and Doolittle, Missouri. The old road is highly visible for eastbound traffic near Powellville. , the rocks carved away for the new roadbed have virtually no lichen, reflecting that this construction occurred rather recently.

Originally, the eastern terminus of I-44 was at the intersection with I-55, I-64, I-70, and US 40, by the Poplar Street Bridge. However, when I-70 was rerouted to cross the Mississippi River at the newly constructed Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge, I-44 was extended about north to end at I-70 at the bridge.

==Auxiliary routes==
I-44 has two auxiliary routes. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, there is an I-244 and an unsigned I-444. There was also another auxiliary route located in St. Louis, Missouri, but was decommissioned in 1974. It was instead signed as I-270. In Fall 2023, the AASHTO approved designating the Kilpatrick Turnpike in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma as I-344.

===Business routes===

All business loops of I-44 are located in Missouri. They serve Joplin, Sarcoxie, Mount Vernon, Springfield, Lebanon, Waynesville–St. Robert, Rolla, and Pacific. A business spur links I-44 with Fort Leonard Wood.

==Politics==
Deschutes County has traditionally fallen politically more in line with the conservative eastern side of Oregon than the liberal western side. However, this has shifted in recent years, due in large part to the rapid growth and urbanization within the city of Bend. By January 2021, a narrow plurality of registered voters in Deschutes County were registered with the Democratic Party. In addition, Joe Biden carried the county with 52.7% of the vote in the 2020 presidential election compared to 44.4% of the vote for Donald Trump, thereby marking the first time a Democratic Party candidate won the county since 1992 and the first time a Democratic Party candidate received a majority of the vote in the county since 1964.

In 2008, the Democratic Party won the Oregon House seat encompassing the city of Bend, becoming the only Democratic-controlled district east of the Cascades, though the Republicans retook the seat in 2010. Republicans would hold the seat for the remainder of the decade until 2020, when Democrat Jason Kropf was elected to the State House and re-elected in 2022. In 2022, the 53rd District, including Redmond, elected Democrat Emerson Levy to the Oregon House. Portions of Deschutes County also fall into the 55th, 59th and 60th House Districts, respectively held by Republicans E. Werner Reschke, Vikki Breese-Iverson and Mark Owens. Deschutes County is also divvied up between the 27th, 28th and 30th Senate Districts in the Oregon Senate, respectively represented by Republicans Tim Knopp, Dennis Linthicum and Lynn Findley.

Deschutes County is currently one of 11 counties in Oregon in which therapeutic psilocybin is legal.











==Economy==
During the 1990s, Deschutes County experienced the most rapid growth of any county in Oregon, largely due to the year-round availability of recreational activities, and its location as the nearest population center to much of the central Cascade Range. Beyond tourism, principal industries in the county are lumber, ranching and agriculture—chiefly potatoes. The Forest Service owns 51% of the lands within the county boundaries.

Deschutes County is the home of four &quot;destination resorts&quot; as defined by Oregon&#x27;s Department of Land Conservation and Development. These resorts are major employers within the county. Three of these resorts, Sunriver, Eagle Crest, and Pronghorn, are among the county&#x27;s ten largest tax payers.

==Geology==
The overall defining landscape of Deschutes County is primarily marked with that of lava flows. Most of the lava found in Deschutes County issued forth from Newberry Volcano located just south of Bend. Because of this, many lava tubes are located within, including the prominent Lava River Cave. As a consequence, the county is the most cave-rich in the state of Oregon, with over 500 known caves in the county. Other prominent lava flows exist too, especially those related to the Mount Bachelor Volcanic Chain which consists of Mount Bachelor as well as three smaller shield volcanos, and a series of cinder cones.

Large volcanoes serve as a backdrop to the city of Bend in Deschutes County, ranging from the prominent Three Sisters, Mount Washington, Mount Bachelor, Broken Top, Newberry, Tumalo Mountain, Maiden Peak and others. A group of geologists have discovered Smith Rock State Park is part of an ancient supervolcano called the Crooked River caldera with a rim nearly six times the diameter of Newberry Volcano&#x27;s caldera. This ancient supervolcano has long gone extinct. Its crater rim is barely recognizable as remnants mark portions of Powell Buttes, Gray Butte, and the western front of the Ochoco Mountains at Barnes Butte.

On the eastern side of the county, it is mostly characterized by large buttes of much older volcanic origin. Most of these did not create any proper lava flows, or at least none that are known to exist. Some of the prominent buttes include Horse Ridge, Pine Mountain, China Hat, and several others on the county border.

Two main types of lava flows are found within the county. The most common are the pāhoehoe flows which have been partially buried by volcanic ash, tephra deposits, and dirt over tens to hundreds of thousands of years. The aā flows are fewer but much more prominent, with the most notable being associated with Lava Butte and the Lava Cast Forest in the Newberry National Volcanic Monument.

<doc id="92025" wikidata="Q3277149" url="?curid=92025" title="United States antitrust law">
<text>In the United States, antitrust law is a collection of mostly federal laws that govern the conduct and organization of businesses in order to promote economic competition and prevent unjustified monopolies. The three main U.S. antitrust statutes are the Sherman Act of 1890, the Clayton Act of 1914, and the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914. These acts serve three major functions. First, Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits price fixing and the operation of cartels, and prohibits other collusive practices that unreasonably restrain trade. Second, Section 7 of the Clayton Act restricts the mergers and acquisitions of organizations that may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly. Third, Section 2 of the Sherman Act prohibits monopolization.

Federal antitrust laws provide for both civil and criminal enforcement. Civil antitrust enforcement occurs through lawsuits filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, and private parties who have been harmed by an antitrust violation. Criminal antitrust enforcement is done only by the Justice Department&#x27;s Antitrust Division. Additionally, U.S. state governments may also enforce their own antitrust laws, which mostly mirror federal antitrust laws, regarding commerce occurring solely within their own state&#x27;s borders.

The scope of antitrust laws, and the degree to which they should interfere in an enterprise&#x27;s freedom to conduct business, or to protect smaller businesses, communities and consumers, are strongly debated. Some economists argue that antitrust laws actually impede competition, and may discourage businesses from pursuing activities that would be beneficial to society. One view suggests that antitrust laws should focus solely on the benefits to consumers and overall efficiency, while a broad range of legal and economic theory sees the role of antitrust laws as also controlling economic power in the public interest. Surveys of American Economic Association members since the 1970s have shown that professional economists generally agree with the statement: &quot;Antitrust laws should be enforced vigorously.&quot;

==Nomenclature==
In the United States and Canada, and to a lesser extent in the European Union, the modern law governing monopolies and economic competition is known by its original name &quot;antitrust law&quot;. The term &quot;antitrust&quot; came from late 19th-century American industrialists&#x27; practice of using trusts—legal arrangements where one is given ownership of property to hold solely for another&#x27;s benefit—to consolidate separate companies into large conglomerates. These &quot;corporate trusts&quot; died out in the early 20th century as U.S. states 
passed laws that made it easier to create new corporations. In most other countries, antitrust law is now called &quot;competition law&quot; or &quot;anti-monopoly law&quot;.

==History==

===Creation and early years (1890–1910s)===
American antitrust law formally began in 1890 with the U.S. Congress&#x27;s passage of the Sherman Act, although a few U.S. states had passed local antitrust laws during the preceding year. Using broad and general terms, the Sherman Act outlawed &quot;monopoliz[ation]&quot; and &quot;every contract, combination ... or conspiracy in restraint of trade&quot;. 
Federal judges quickly began struggling with the broad wording of the Sherman Act, recognizing that interpreting it literally could make even simple business associations such as partnerships illegal. They began developing principles for distinguishing between &quot;naked&quot; trade restraints between rivals that suppressed competition and other restraints that promoted competition. 

The Sherman Act gave the U.S. Department of Justice the authority to enforce it, but the U.S. presidents and U.S. Attorneys General in power during the 1890s and early 1900s showed little interest in doing so. With little interest in enforcing the Sherman Act and courts interpreting it relatively narrowly, a wave of large industrial mergers swept the United States in the late 1890s and early 1900s. The rise of the Progressive Era prompted public officials to increase enforcement of antitrust laws. The Justice Department sued 45 companies under the Sherman Act during the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt (1901–09) and 90 companies during the presidency of William Howard Taft (1909–13).

===Rise of &quot;Rule of Reason&quot; (1910s–1930s)===

In 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court reframed U.S. antitrust law as a &quot;rule of reason&quot; in its landmark decision &quot;Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States&quot;. At trial, the Justice Department had successfully argued that the petroleum conglomerate Standard Oil, led by its founder John D. Rockefeller, had violated the Sherman Act by building a monopoly in the oil refining industry through economic threats against competitors and secret rebate deals with railroads. On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the trial court&#x27;s verdict, holding that Standard Oil&#x27;s high market share was proof of its monopoly power and ordering it to break itself up into 34 separate companies. At the same time, however, the Court also held that although the Sherman Act prohibited &quot;every&quot; restraint of trade, it actually banned only those that were &quot;unreasonable&quot;. It ruled that the Sherman Act was to be interpreted as a &quot;rule of reason&quot; under which the legality of most business practices would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to their effect on competition, with only the most egregious practices being illegal &quot;per se&quot;.

Many observers thought the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Standard Oil&quot; represented an effort by conservative federal judges to &quot;soften&quot; the Sherman Act and narrow its scope. Congress reacted in 1914 by passing two new laws: the Clayton Act, which outlawed using mergers and acquisitions to achieve monopolies and created an antitrust law exemption for collective bargaining; and the Federal Trade Commission Act, which created the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as an independent agency that has shared jurisdiction with the Justice Department over federal civil antitrust enforcement and has the power to prohibit &quot;unfair methods of competition&quot;.

Despite the passage of the Clayton Act and the FTC Act, U.S. antitrust enforcement was not aggressive between the mid-1910s and the 1930s. Based on their experience with the War Industries Board during World War I, many American economists, government officials, and business leaders adopted the associationalist view that close collaboration among business leaders and government officials could efficiently guide the economy. Some Americans abandoned faith in free market competition entirely after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Advocates of these views championed the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 and the centralized economic planning experiments during the early stages of the New Deal.

The Supreme Court&#x27;s decisions in antitrust cases during this period reflected these views, and the Court had a &quot;largely tolerant&quot; attitude toward collusion and cooperation between competitors. One prominent example was the 1918 decision &quot;Chicago Board of Trade v. United States&quot;, in which the Court ruled that a Chicago Board of Trade rule banning commodity brokers from buying or selling grain forwards after the close of business at 2:00pm each day at any price other than that day&#x27;s closing price did not violate the Sherman Act. The Court said that although the rule was a restraint on trade, a comprehensive examination of the rule&#x27;s purposes and effects showed that it &quot;merely regulates, and perhaps thereby promotes competition.&quot;

===Structuralist approach (1930s–1970s)===
During the mid-1930s, confidence in the statist centralized economic planning models that had been popular in the early years of the New Deal era began to wane. At the urging of economists such as Frank Knight and Henry C. Simons, President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s economic advisors began persuading him that free market competition was the key to recovery from the Great Depression. Simons, in particular, argued for robust antitrust enforcement to “de-concentrate” American industries and promote competition. In response, Roosevelt appointed &quot;trustbusting&quot; lawyers like Thurman Arnold to serve in the Justice Department&#x27;s Antitrust Division, which had been established in 1919. 

This intellectual shift influenced American courts to abandon their acceptance of sector-wide cooperation among companies. Instead, American antitrust jurisprudence began following strict &quot;structuralist&quot; rules that focused on markets&#x27; structures and their levels of concentration. Judges usually gave little credence to defendant companies&#x27; attempts to justify their conduct using economic efficiencies, even when they were supported by economic data and analysis. In its 1940 decision &quot;United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.&quot;, the Supreme Court refused to apply the rule of reason to an agreement between oil refiners to buy up surplus gasoline from independent refining companies. It ruled that price-fixing agreements between competing companies were illegal &quot;per se&quot; under section 1 of the Sherman Act and would be treated as crimes even if the companies claimed to be merely recreating past government planning schemes. The Court began applying &quot;per se&quot; illegality to other business practices such as tying, group boycotts, market allocation agreements, exclusive territory agreements for sales, and vertical restraints limiting retailers to geographic areas. Courts also became more willing to find that dominant companies&#x27; business practices constituted illegal monopolization under section 2 of the Sherman Act. 

American courts were even stricter when hearing merger challenges under the Clayton Act during this era, due in part to Congress&#x27;s passage of the Celler-Kefauver Act of 1950, which banned consolidation of companies&#x27; stock or assets even in situations that did not produce market dominance. For example, in its 1962 decision &quot;Brown Shoe Co. v. United States&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that a proposed merger was illegal even though the resulting company would have controlled only five percent of the relevant market. In a now-famous line from his dissent in the 1966 decision &quot;United States v. Von&#x27;s Grocery Co.&quot;, Supreme Court justice Potter Stewart remarked: &quot;The sole consistency that I can find [in U.S. merger law] is that in litigation under [the Clayton Act], the Government always wins.&quot;

===Rise of the Chicago School (1970s–present)===
The &quot;structuralist&quot; interpretation of U.S. antitrust law began losing favor in the early 1970s in the face of harsh criticism by economists and legal scholars from the University of Chicago. Scholars from the Chicago school of economics had long called for reducing price regulation and limiting barriers to entry. Newer Chicago economists like Aaron Director argued that there were economic efficiency explanations for some practices that had been condemned under the structuralist interpretation of the Sherman and Clayton Acts. Much of their economic analysis involved game theory, which showed that some conduct that had been thought uniformly anticompetitive, such as preemptive capacity expansion, could be either pro- or anticompetitive depending on the circumstances.

The writings of Yale Law School professor Robert Bork and University of Chicago Law School professors Richard Posner and Frank Easterbrook, who all later became prominent federal appellate judges, translated Chicago economists&#x27; analytical advances into legal principles that judges could readily apply. Pointing out that economic analysis showed that some previously condemned practices were actually procompetitive and had economic benefits that outweighed their dangers, they argued that many antitrust bright-line &quot;per se&quot; rules of illegality were unwarranted and should be replaced by the rule of reason. Judges increasingly accepted their ideas from the mid-1970s on, motivated in part by the United States&#x27; declining economic dominance amidst the 1973–1975 recession and rising competition from East Asian and European countries.

The &quot;pivotal event&quot; in this shift was the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1977 decision &quot;Continental Television, Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc&quot;. In a decision that prominently cited Chicago school of economics scholarship, the &quot;GTE Sylvania&quot; Court ruled that non-price vertical restrictions in contracts were no longer &quot;per se&quot; illegal and should be analyzed under the rule of reason. Overall, the Supreme Court&#x27;s antitrust rulings during this era on collusion cases under section 1 of the Sherman Act reflected tension between the older &quot;absolutist&quot; approach and the newer Chicago endorsing the rule of reason and economic analysis. 

The Justice Department and FTC lost most of the monopolization cases they brought under section 2 of the Sherman Act during this era. One of the government&#x27;s few anti-monopoly victories was &quot;United States v. AT&amp;T&quot;, which led to the breakup of Bell Telephone and its monopoly on U.S. telephone service in 1982. The general &quot;trimming back&quot; of antitrust law in the face of economic analysis also resulted in more permissive standards for mergers. In the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1974 decision &quot;United States v. General Dynamics Corp.&quot;, the federal government lost a merger challenge at the Supreme Court for the first time in over 25 years.

In 1999 a coalition of 19 states and the federal Justice Department sued Microsoft. A highly publicized trial in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found that Microsoft had strong-armed many companies in an attempt to prevent competition from the Netscape browser. In 2000, the trial court ordered Microsoft to split in two, preventing it from future misbehavior. Microsoft appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which affirmed in part and reversed in part. In addition, it removed the judge from the case for discussing the case with the media while it was still pending. With the case in front of a new judge, Microsoft and the government settled, with the government dropping the case in return for Microsoft agreeing to cease many of the practices the government challenged.

==Cartels and collusion==

Preventing collusion and cartels that act in restraint of trade is an essential task of antitrust law. It reflects the view that each business has a duty to act independently on the market, and so earn its profits solely by providing better priced and quality products than its competitors.

The Sherman Act §1 prohibits &quot;[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce.&quot; This targets two or more distinct enterprises acting together in a way that harms third parties. It does not capture the decisions of a single enterprise, or a single economic entity, even though the form of an entity may be two or more separate legal persons or companies. In &quot;Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.&quot; it was held an agreement between a parent company and a wholly owned subsidiary could not be subject to antitrust law, because the decision took place within a single economic entity. This reflects the view that if the enterprise (as an economic entity) has not acquired a monopoly position, or has significant market power, then no harm is done. The same rationale has been extended to joint ventures, where corporate shareholders make a decision through a new company they form. In &quot;Texaco Inc. v. Dagher&quot; the Supreme Court held unanimously that a price set by a joint venture between Texaco and Shell Oil did not count as making an unlawful agreement. Thus the law draws a &quot;basic distinction between concerted and independent action&quot;. Multi-firm conduct tends to be seen as more likely than single-firm conduct to have an unambiguously negative effect and &quot;is judged more sternly&quot;. Generally the law identifies four main categories of agreement. First, some agreements such as price fixing or sharing markets are automatically unlawful, or illegal &quot;per se&quot;. Second, because the law does not seek to prohibit every kind of agreement that hinders freedom of contract, it developed a &quot;rule of reason&quot; where a practice might restrict trade in a way that is seen as positive or beneficial for consumers or society. Third, significant problems of proof and identification of wrongdoing arise where businesses make no overt contact, or simply share information, but appear to act in concert. Tacit collusion, particularly in concentrated markets with a small number of competitors or oligopolists, have led to significant controversy over whether or not antitrust authorities should intervene. Fourth, vertical agreements between a business and a supplier or purchaser &quot;up&quot; or &quot;downstream&quot; raise concerns about the exercise of market power, however they are generally subject to a more relaxed standard under the &quot;rule of reason&quot;.

===&quot;Per se&quot; illegal practices===
Some practices are deemed by the courts to be so obviously detrimental that they are categorized as being automatically unlawful, or illegal &quot;per se&quot;. The simplest and central case of this is price fixing. This involves an agreement by businesses to set the price or consideration of a good or service which they buy or sell from others at a specific level. If the agreement is durable, the general term for these businesses is a cartel. It is irrelevant whether or not the businesses succeed in increasing their profits, or whether together they reach the level of having market power as might a monopoly. Such collusion is illegal &quot;per se&quot;.

*&quot;United States v. Trenton Potteries Co.&quot;, per se illegality of price fixing
*&quot;Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States&quot;, 
*&quot;United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.&quot;, 

Bid rigging is a form of price fixing and market allocation that involves an agreement in which one party of a group of bidders will be designated to win the bid. Geographic market allocation is an agreement between competitors not to compete within each other&#x27;s geographic territories.

*&quot;Addyston Pipe and Steel Co. v. United States&quot; pipe manufacturers had agreed among themselves to designate one lowest bidder for government contracts. This was held to be an unlawful restraint of trade contrary to the Sherman Act. However, following the reasoning of Justice Taft in the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court held that implicit in the Sherman Act §1 there was a rule of reason, so that not every agreement which restrained the freedom of contract of the parties would count as an anti-competitive violation.
*&quot;Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. California&quot;, 113 S.Ct. 2891 (1993) 5 to 4, a group of reinsurance companies acting in London were successfully sued by California for conspiring to make U.S. insurance companies abandon policies beneficial to consumers, but costly to reinsure. The Sherman Act was held to have extraterritorial application, to agreements outside U.S. territory.

;Group boycotts of competitors, customers or distributors
*&quot;Fashion Originators&#x27; Guild of America v. FTC&quot;, 312 U.S. 457 (1941) the FOGA, a combination of clothes designers, agreed not to sell their clothes to shops which stocked replicas of their designs, and employed their own inspectors. Held to violate the Sherman Act §1
*&quot;Klor&#x27;s, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc.&quot;, 359 U.S. 207 (1959) a group boycott is per se unlawful, even if it may be connected with a private dispute, and will have little effect upon the markets
*&quot;American Medical Association v. United States&quot;, 317 U.S. 519 (1943)
*&quot;Molinas v. National Basketball Association&quot;, 190 F. Supp. 241 (S.D.N.Y. 1961)
*&quot;Associated Press v. United States&quot;, 326 U.S. 1 (1945) 6 to 3, a prohibition on members selling &quot;spontaneous news&quot; violated the Sherman Act, as well as making membership difficult, and freedom of speech among newspapers was no defense, nor was the absence of a total monopoly
*&quot;Northwest Wholesale Stationers v. Pacific Stationery&quot;, 472 U.S. 284 (1985) it was not &quot;per se&quot; unlawful for the Northwest Wholesale Stationers, a purchasing co-operative where Pacific Stationery had been a member, to expel Pacific Stationery without any procedure or hearing or reason. Whether there were competitive effects would have to be adjudged under the rule of reason.
*&quot;NYNEX Corp. v. Discon, Inc.&quot;, 525 U.S. 128 (1998) the per se group boycott prohibition does not apply to a buyer&#x27;s decision to purchase goods from one seller or another

===Rule of reason===
If an antitrust claim does not fall within a &quot;per se&quot; illegal category, the plaintiff must show the conduct causes harm in &quot;restraint of trade&quot; under the Sherman Act §1 according to &quot;the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied&quot;. This essentially means that unless a plaintiff can point to a clear precedent, to which the situation is analogous, proof of an anti-competitive effect is more difficult. The reason for this is that the courts have endeavoured to draw a line between practices that restrain trade in a &quot;good&quot; compared to a &quot;bad&quot; way. In the first case, &quot;United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association&quot;, the Supreme Court found that railroad companies had acted unlawfully by setting up an organisation to fix transport prices. The railroads had protested that their intention was to keep prices low, not high. The court found that this was not true, but stated that not every &quot;restraint of trade&quot; in a literal sense could be unlawful. Just as under the common law, the restraint of trade had to be &quot;unreasonable&quot;. In &quot;Chicago Board of Trade v. United States&quot; the Supreme Court found a &quot;good&quot; restraint of trade. The Chicago Board of Trade had a rule that commodities traders were not allowed to privately agree to sell or buy after the market&#x27;s closing time (and then finalise the deals when it opened the next day). The reason for the Board of Trade having this rule was to ensure that all traders had an equal chance to trade at a transparent market price. It plainly restricted trading, but the Chicago Board of Trade argued this was beneficial. Justice Brandeis, giving judgment for a unanimous Supreme Court, held the rule to be pro-competitive, and comply with the rule of reason. It did not violate the Sherman Act §1. As he put it,

*&quot;Broadcast Music v. Columbia Broadcasting System&quot;, blanket licenses did not necessarily count as price fixing under a relaxed rule of reason test.
*&quot;Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society&quot;, 457 U.S. 332 (1982) 4 to 3 held that a maximum price agreement for doctors was per se unlawful under the Sherman Act section 1.
*&quot;Wilk v. American Medical Association&quot;, 895 F.2d 352 (7th Cir. 1990) the American Medical Association&#x27;s boycott of chiropractors violated the Sherman Act §1 because there was insufficient proof that it was unscientific
*&quot;United States v. Topco Assocs., Inc.&quot;, 405 U.S. 596 (1972)
*&quot;Palmer v. BRG of Georgia, Inc.&quot;, 498 U.S. 46 (1990)
*&quot;National Soc&#x27;y of Prof. Engineers v. United States&quot;, 435 U.S. 679 (1978); ¶¶219-220 -
*&quot;NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma&quot;, 468 U.S. 85 (1984) 7 to 2, held that the National College Athletics Association&#x27;s restriction of television of games, to encourage live attendance, was restricting supply, and therefore unlawful.
*&quot;California Dental Assn. v. FTC&quot;, 526 U.S. 756 (1999)
*&quot;FTC v. Indiana Fed&#x27;n of Dentists&quot;, 476 U.S. 447 (1986)

===Tacit collusion and oligopoly===
*&quot;Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp.&quot;, 475 U.S. 574 (1986) held that the evidence needed to show unlawful collusion contrary to the Sherman Act must be enough to exclude the possibility of individual behavior.
*&quot;Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly&quot;, 550 U.S. 544 (2007) 5 to 2, while Bell Atlantic and other major telephone companies were alleged to have acted in concert to share markets, and not compete in each other&#x27;s territory to the detriment of small businesses, it was held that in absence of evidence of an agreement, parallel conduct is not enough to ground a case under the Sherman Act §1
*&quot;Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States&quot;, 306 U.S. 208 (1939)
*&quot;Theatre Enterprises v. Paramount Distributing&quot;, 346 U.S. 537 (1954), no evidence of illegal agreement, however film distributors gave first film releases to downtown Baltimore theatres, and suburban theatres were forced to wait longer. Held, there needed to be evidence of conspiracy to injure
*&quot;United States v. American Tobacco Company&quot;, 221 U.S. 106 (1911) found to have monopolized the trade.
*&quot;American Tobacco Co. v. United States&quot;, 328 U.S. 781 (1946) after American Tobacco Co was broken up, the four entities were found to have achieved a collectively dominant position, which still amounted to monopolization of the market contrary to the Sherman Act §2
*&quot;American Column &amp; Lumber Co. v. United States&quot;, 257 US 377 (1921) information sharing
*&quot;Maple Flooring Manufacturers&#x27; Assn. v. United States&quot;, 268 U.S. 563 (1925)
*&quot;United States v. Container Corp.&quot;, 393 U.S. 333 (1969)
*Airline Tariff Publishing Company, settlement with the US Department of Justice

===Vertical restraints===
;Resale price maintenance
*&quot;Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park and Sons&quot;, 220 U.S. 373 (1911) affirmed a lower court&#x27;s holding that a massive minimum resale price maintenance scheme was unreasonable and thus offended Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
*&quot;Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Seagram &amp; Sons, Inc.&quot;, 340 U.S. 211 (1951) it was unlawful for private liquor dealers to require that their products only be resold up to a maximum price. It unduly restrained the freedom of businesses and was per se illegal.
*&quot;Albrecht v. Herald Co.&quot;, 390 U.S. 145 (1968) setting a fixed price, minimum or maximum, held to violate section 1 of the Sherman Act
*&quot;State Oil Co. v. Khan&quot;, 522 U.S. 3 (1997) vertical maximum price fixing had to be adjudged according to a rule of reason
*&quot;Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc.&quot; 551 U.S. 877 (2007) 5 to 4 decision that vertical price restraints were not &quot;per se&quot; illegal. A leather manufacturer therefore did not violate the Sherman Act by stopping delivery of goods to a retailer after the retailer refused to raise its prices to the leather manufacturer&#x27;s standards.

;Outlet, territory or customer limitations
*&quot;Packard Motor Car Co. v. Webster Motor Car Co.&quot;, 243 F.2d 418, 420 (D.C. Cir.), cert, denied, 355 U.S. 822 (1957)
*&quot;Continental Television v. GTE Sylvania&quot;, 433 U.S. 36 (1977) 6 to 2, held that it was not an antitrust violation, and it fell within the rule of reason, for a seller to limit the number of franchises and require the franchisees only sell goods within its area
*&quot;United States v. Colgate &amp; Co.&quot;, there is no unlawful action by a manufacturer or seller, who publicly announces a price policy, and then refuses to deal with businesses who do not subsequently comply with the policy. This is in contrast to agreements to maintain a certain price.
*&quot;United States v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co.&quot;, under Sherman Act §4
*&quot;Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp.&quot;, , stating that, &quot;under Colgate, the manufacturer can announce its re-sale prices in advance and refuse to deal with those who fail to comply, and a distributor is free to acquiesce to the manufacturer&#x27;s demand in order to avoid termination&quot;. Monsanto, an agricultural chemical, terminated its distributorship agreement with Spray-Rite on the ground that it failed to hire trained salesmen and promote sales to dealers adequately. Held, not per se illegal, because the restriction related to non-price matters, and so was to be judged under the rule of reason.
*&quot;Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp.&quot;, electronic calculators; &quot;a vertical restraint is not illegal per se unless it includes some agreement on price or price levels. ... [T]here is a presumption in favor of a rule-of-reason standard; [and] departure from that standard must be justified by demonstrable economic effect, such as the facilitation of cartelizing ... &quot;

==Mergers==
Under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, a merger or acquisition is illegal if its effect &quot;may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.&quot; 

The FTC and the Justice Department both have the authority to file lawsuits seeking to block or invalidate a merger. The FTC may challenge a merger in its own administrative court instead of filing a lawsuit in a United States district court, although defendants can appeal the FTC&#x27;s decisions to one of the United States courts of appeals. A private party may also file a lawsuit under the Clayton Act if an unlawful merger has injured its ability to compete for business. 

Under the Hart–Scott–Rodino (HSR) Act of 1976, if a proposed merger and the parties executing it are both above certain sizes, then the parties must report it in advance to the FTC and the Justice Department. The parties must then wait 30 days while the FTC or the Justice Department reviews the merger and decides whether to seek to block it. The 30-day period usually ends with the FTC or Justice Department taking one of three actions: declining to challenge the merger, filing a lawsuit to challenge the merger, or issuing a &quot;Second Request&quot; that extends the waiting period and formally asks the party for all its documents and other information relating to the merger.

===Horizontal mergers===
*&quot;Northern Securities Co. v. United States&quot;, horizontal merger under the Sherman Act
*&quot;United States v. Philadelphia National Bank&quot;, the second and third largest of 42 banks in the Philadelphia area would lead to a 30% market control in a concentrated market, and so violated the Clayton Act §7. Banks were not exempt even though there was additional legislation under the Bank Merger Act of 1960.
*&quot;United States v. Von&#x27;s Grocery Co.&quot;, 384 U.S. 270 (1966) a merger of two grocery firms in the Los Angeles area did violate the Clayton Act §7, particularly considering the amendment by the Celler–Kefauver Act 1950
*&quot;United States v. General Dynamics Corp.&quot;, 415 U.S. 486 (1974) General Dynamics Corp had taken control over, by share purchase, United Electric Coal Companies, a strip-mining coal producer.
*Horizontal Merger Guidelines (2010)
*&quot;FTC v. Staples, Inc.&quot;, 970 F. Supp. 1066 (1997)
*&quot;Hospital Corp. of America v. FTC&quot;, 807 F. 2d 1381 (1986)
*&quot;Federal Trade Commission v. H.J. Heinz Co.&quot;, 246 F.3d 708 (2001)
*&quot;United States v. Oracle Corp&quot;, 331 F. Supp. 2d 1098 (2004)

===Vertical mergers===

*&quot;United States v. Columbia Steel Co.&quot;, 
*&quot;United States v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co.&quot;, 
*&quot;Brown Shoe Co., Inc. v. United States&quot;, there is not one single test for whether a merger substantially lessens competition, but a variety of economic and other factors may be considered. Two shoe retailers and manufacturers merging was held to substantially lessen competition, given the market in towns over 10,000 people for men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s shoes.

===Conglomerate mergers===

*&quot;United States v. Sidney W. Winslow&quot;, 
*&quot;United States v. Continental Can Co.&quot;, concerning the definition of the market segments in which the Continental Can Co was performing a merger.
*&quot;FTC v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co.&quot;, 

==Monopoly and power==

The law&#x27;s treatment of monopolies is potentially the strongest in the field of antitrust law. Judicial remedies can force large organizations to be broken up, subject them to positive obligations, impose massive penalties, and/or sentence implicated employees to jail. Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, every &quot;person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize ... any part of the trade or commerce among the several States&quot; commits an offence. The courts have interpreted this to mean that monopoly is not unlawful &quot;per se&quot;, but only if acquired through prohibited conduct. Historically, where the ability of judicial remedies to combat market power have ended, the legislature of states or the Federal government have still intervened by taking public ownership of an enterprise, or subjecting the industry to sector specific regulation (frequently done, for example, in the cases water, education, energy or health care). The law on public services and administration goes significantly beyond the realm of antitrust law&#x27;s treatment of monopolies. When enterprises are not under public ownership, and where regulation does not foreclose the application of antitrust law, two requirements must be shown for the offense of monopolization. First, the alleged monopolist must possess sufficient power in an accurately defined market for its products or services. Second, the monopolist must have used its power in a prohibited way. The categories of prohibited conduct are not closed, and are contested in theory. Historically they have been held to include exclusive dealing, price discrimination, refusing to supply an essential facility, product tying and predatory pricing.

===Monopolization===

*&quot;Northern Securities Co. v. United States&quot;, 193 U.S. 197 (1904) 5 to 4, a railway monopoly, formed through a merger of 3 corporations was ordered to be dissolved. The owner, James Jerome Hill was forced to manage his ownership stake in each independently.
*&quot;Swift &amp; Co. v. United States&quot;, 196 U.S. 375 (1905) the antitrust laws entitled the federal government to regulate monopolies that had a direct impact on commerce
*&quot;Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States&quot;, 221 U.S. 1 (1911) Standard Oil was dismantled into geographical entities given its size, and that it was too much of a monopoly
*&quot;United States v. American Tobacco Company&quot;, 221 U.S. 106 (1911) found to have monopolized the trade.
*&quot;United States v. Alcoa&quot;, 148 F.2d 416 (2d Cir. 1945) a monopoly can be deemed to exist depending on the size of the market. It was generally irrelevant how the monopoly was achieved since the fact of being dominant on the market was negative for competition. (Criticised by Alan Greenspan.)
*&quot;United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.&quot;, 351 U.S. 377 (1956), illustrates the cellophane paradox of defining the relevant market. If a monopolist has set a price very high, there may now be many substitutable goods at similar prices, which could lead to a conclusion that the market share is small, and there is no monopoly. However, if a competitive price were charged, there would be a lower price, and so very few substitutes, whereupon the market share would be very high, and a monopoly established.
*&quot;United States v. Syufy Enterprises&quot;, 903 F.2d 659 (9th Cir. 1990) necessity of barriers to entry
*&quot;Lorain Journal Co. v. United States&quot;, 342 U.S. 143 (1951) attempted monopolization

*Sherman Act 1890 §1, covers making purchase of goods conditional on purchase of other goods, if there is sufficient market power
*&quot;International Business Machines Corp. v. United States&quot;, requiring a leased machine to be operated only with supplies from IBM was contrary to Clayton Act §3.
*&quot;International Salt Co. v. United States&quot;, it would be a &quot;per se&quot; infringement of the Sherman Act §2 for a seller, who has a legal monopoly through a patent, to tie buyers to purchase products over which the seller does not have a patent
*&quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.&quot;, 334 US 131 (1948) Hollywood studios practice of requiring block booking was unlawful among other things

*&quot;United States v. Loew&#x27;s Inc.&quot;, 371 U.S. 38 (1962) product bundling and price discrimination. The existence of a tie was sufficient to create a presumption of market power.
*&quot;Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde&quot;, reversing &quot;Loew&#x27;s&quot;, it was necessary to prove sufficient market power for a tying requirement to be anti-competitive
*&quot;United States v. Microsoft Corporation&quot; 253 F.3d 34 (2001) and District Court (1999) Microsoft ordered to be split into two for its monopolistic practices, including tying, but then the ruling was reversed by the Court of Appeals.

===Predatory pricing===

In theory predatory pricing happens when large companies with huge cash reserves and large lines of credit stifle competition by selling their products and services at a loss for a time, to force their smaller competitors out of business. With no competition, they are then free to consolidate control of the industry and charge whatever prices they wish. At this point, there is also little motivation for investing in further technological research, since there are no competitors left to gain an advantage over. High barriers to entry such as large upfront investment, notably named sunk costs, requirements in infrastructure and exclusive agreements with distributors, customers, and wholesalers ensure that it will be difficult for any new competitors to enter the market, and that if any do, the trust will have ample advance warning and time in which to either buy the competitor out, or engage in its own research and return to predatory pricing long enough to force the competitor out of business. Critics argue that the empirical evidence shows that &quot;predatory pricing&quot; does not work in practice and is better defeated by a truly free market than by antitrust laws (see Criticism of the theory of predatory pricing).

*&quot;Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.&quot;, 509 U.S. 209 (1993) to prove predatory pricing the plaintiff must show that changes in market conditions are adverse to its interests, and that (1) prices are below an appropriate measure of its rival&#x27;s costs, and (2) the competitor had a reasonable prospect or a &quot;dangerous probability&quot; of recouping its investment in the alleged scheme.
*&quot;Weyerhaeuser Company v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Company&quot;, 549 U.S. 312 (2007) a plaintiff must prove that, to make a claim of predatory buying, the alleged violator is likely to recoup the cost of the alleged predatory activity. This involved the saw mill market.

===Intellectual property===

*&quot;Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co.&quot;, 210 U.S. 405 (1908) 8 to 1, concerning a self opening paper bag, it was not an unlawful use of a monopoly position to refuse to license a patent&#x27;s use to others, since the essence of a patent was the freedom not to do so.
*&quot;United States v. Univis Lens Co.&quot;, 316 U.S. 241 (1942) once a business sold its patented lenses, it was not allowed to lawfully control the use of the lens, by fixing a price for resale. This was the exhaustion doctrine.
*&quot;International Salt Co. v. United States&quot;, 332 U.S. 392 (1947) it would be a &quot;per se&quot; infringement of the Sherman Act §2 for a seller, who has a legal monopoly through a patent, to tie buyers to purchase products over which the seller does not have a patent
*&quot;Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery &amp; Chemical Corp.&quot;, 382 U.S. 172 (1965) illegal monopolization through the maintenance and enforcement of a patent obtained via fraud on the Patent Office case, sometimes called &quot;Walker Process fraud&quot;.

*Apple Inc. litigation and &quot;United States v. Apple Inc.&quot;

==Scope of antitrust law==

Antitrust laws do not apply to, or are modified in, several specific categories of enterprise (including sports, media, utilities, health care, insurance, banks, and financial markets) and for several kinds of actor (such as employees or consumers taking collective action).

===Collective actions===
First, since the Clayton Act 1914 §6, there is no application of antitrust laws to agreements between employees to form or act in labor unions. This was seen as the &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; for labor, as the Act laid down that the &quot;labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce&quot;. The purpose was to ensure that employees with unequal bargaining power were not prevented from combining in the same way that their employers could combine in corporations, subject to the restrictions on mergers that the Clayton Act set out. However, sufficiently autonomous workers, such as professional sports players have been held to fall within antitrust provisions.

=== Pro sports exemptions and the NFL cartel ===

Second, professional sports leagues enjoy a number of exemptions. Mergers and joint agreements of professional football, hockey, baseball, and basketball leagues are exempt. Major League Baseball was held to be broadly exempt from antitrust law in the Supreme Court case &quot;Federal Baseball Club v. National League&quot;. The court unanimously held that the baseball league&#x27;s organization meant that there was no commerce between the states taking place, even though teams traveled across state lines to put on the games. That travel was merely incidental to a business which took place in each state. It was subsequently held in 1952 in &quot;Toolson v. New York Yankees&quot;, and then again in 1972 &quot;Flood v. Kuhn&quot;, that the baseball league&#x27;s exemption was an &quot;aberration&quot;. However Congress had accepted it, and favored it, so retroactively overruling the exemption was no longer a matter for the courts, but the legislature. In &quot;United States v. International Boxing Club of New York&quot;, it was held that, unlike baseball, boxing was not exempt, and in &quot;Radovich v. National Football League (NFL)&quot;, professional football is generally subject to antitrust laws. As a result of the AFL-NFL merger, the National Football League was also given exemptions in exchange for certain conditions, such as not directly competing with college or high school football. However, the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in American Needle Inc. v. NFL characterised the NFL as a &quot;cartel&quot; of 32 independent businesses subject to antitrust law, not a single entity.

=== Media ===
Third, antitrust laws are modified where they are perceived to encroach upon the media and free speech, or are not strong enough. Newspapers under joint operating agreements are allowed limited antitrust immunity under the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970. More generally, and partly because of concerns about media cross-ownership in the United States, regulation of media is subject to specific statutes, chiefly the Communications Act of 1934 and the Telecommunications Act of 1996, under the guidance of the Federal Communications Commission. The historical policy has been to use the state&#x27;s licensing powers over the airwaves to promote plurality. Antitrust laws do not prevent companies from using the legal system or political process to attempt to reduce competition. Most of these activities are considered legal under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. Also, regulations by states may be immune under the Parker immunity doctrine.

*&quot;Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc., v. Columbia Pictures&quot;, 508 U.S. 49 (1993)
*&quot;Allied Tube v. Indian Head, Inc.&quot;, 486 U.S. 492 (1988)
*&quot;FTC v. Superior Ct. TLA&quot;, 493 U.S. 411 (1990)

===Other===
Fourth, the government may grant monopolies in certain industries such as utilities and infrastructure where multiple players are seen as unfeasible or impractical.

Fifth, insurance is allowed limited antitrust exemptions as provided by the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945.

Sixth, M&amp;A transactions in the defense sector are often subject to greater antitrust scrutiny from the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.
*&quot;United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association&quot;, 322 U.S. 533 (1944) the insurance industry was not exempt from antitrust regulation.
*&quot;Credit Suisse v. Billing&quot;, 551 U.S. 264 (2007) 7 to 1, the industries regulated by the Securities Act 1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act 1934 are exempt from antitrust lawsuits.
*&quot;Parker v. Brown&quot;, 317 U.S. 341 (1943) actions by state governments were held to be exempt from antitrust law, given that there was no original legislative intent to cover anything other than business combinations.
*&quot;Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar&quot;, 421 U.S. 773 (1975) the Virginia State Bar, which was delegated power to set price schedules for lawyers fees, was an unlawful price fixing. It was no longer exempt from the Sherman Act, and constituted a per se infringement.
*&quot;California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.&quot;, 445 U.S. 97 (1980) the state of California acted contrary to the Sherman Act 1890 §1 by setting fair trade wine price schedules. 
*&quot;Rice v. Norman Williams Co.&quot;, 458 U.S. 654 (1982) the Sherman Act did not prohibit a California law which prohibited the importation of goods that were not authorised to be imported by the manufacturer. 
*&quot;Tritent International Corp. v. Commonwealth of Kentucky&quot;, 467 F.3d 547 (2006) Kentucky had not acted unlawfully by giving effect to a Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, because there was no illegal behavior in it. 
*&quot;United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association&quot;, 166 U.S. 290 (1897) the antitrust laws applied to the railroad industry, even though there was a comprehensive scheme of legislation applying to the railroads already. No specific exemption had been given.
*&quot;Silver v. New York Stock Exchange&quot;, 373 U.S. 341 (1963) the NYSE was not exempt from antitrust regulation, even though many of its activities were regulated by the Securities and Exchange Act 1934. 
*&quot;American Society of Mechanical Engineers v. Hydrolevel Corporation&quot;, 456 U.S. 556 (1982) 6 to 3, that the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, a non profit standard developer had violated the Sherman Act by giving information to one competitor, used against another.
*&quot;National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Alston,&quot; 594 U.S. ___ (2021) 9 to 0, the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s caps on player compensation, most notably its restrictions on education benefits for players, restrain competition among colleges and thereby violate the nation&#x27;s antitrust laws.

==Remedies and enforcement==
The remedies for violations of U.S. antitrust laws are as broad as any equitable remedy that a court has the power to make, as well as being able to impose penalties. When private parties have suffered an actionable loss, they may claim compensation. Under the Sherman Act 1890 §7, these may be trebled, a measure to encourage private litigation to enforce the laws and act as a deterrent. The courts may award penalties under §§1 and 2, which are measured according to the size of the company or the business. In their inherent jurisdiction to prevent violations in future, the courts have additionally exercised the power to break up businesses into competing parts under different owners, although this remedy has rarely been exercised (examples include &quot;Standard Oil&quot;, &quot;Northern Securities Company&quot;, &quot;American Tobacco Company&quot;, &quot;AT&amp;T Corporation&quot; and, although reversed on appeal, &quot;Microsoft&quot;). Three levels of enforcement come from the Federal government, primarily through the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, the governments of states, and private parties. Public enforcement of antitrust laws is seen as important, given the cost, complexity and daunting task for private parties to bring litigation, particularly against large corporations.

===Federal government===

The federal government, via both the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, can bring civil lawsuits enforcing the laws. The United States Department of Justice alone may bring criminal antitrust suits under federal antitrust laws. Perhaps the most famous antitrust enforcement actions brought by the federal government were the break-up of AT&amp;T&#x27;s local telephone service monopoly in the early 1980s and its actions against Microsoft in the late 1990s.

Additionally, the federal government also reviews potential mergers to attempt to prevent market concentration. As outlined by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, larger companies attempting to merge must first notify the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice&#x27;s Antitrust Division prior to consummating a merger. These agencies then review the proposed merger first by defining what the market is and then determining the market concentration using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) and each company&#x27;s market share. The government looks to avoid allowing a company to develop market power, which if left unchecked could lead to monopoly power.

The United States Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission target nonreportable mergers for enforcement as well. Notably, between 2009 and 2013, 20% of all merger investigations conducted by the United States Department of Justice involved nonreportable transactions.

*&quot;FTC v. Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Trading Stamp Co.&quot;, 405 U.S. 233 (1972). Case held that the FTC is entitled to bring enforcement action against businesses that act unfairly, as where supermarket trading stamps company injured consumers by prohibiting them from exchanging trading stamps. The FTC could prevent the restrictive practice as &quot;unfair&quot;, even though there was no specific antitrust violation.

====International cooperation====
Despite considerable effort by the Clinton administration, the Federal government attempted to extend antitrust cooperation with other countries for mutual detection, prosecution and enforcement. A bill was unanimously passed by the US Congress; however by 2000 only one treaty has been signed with Australia. On the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission announced it was seeking explanations from a US company, Apple In relation to potentially anticompetitive behaviour against an Australian bank in possible relation to Apple Pay. It is not known whether the treaty could influence the enquiry or outcome.

In many cases large US companies tend to deal with overseas antitrust within the overseas jurisdiction, autonomous of US laws, such as in Microsoft Corp v Commission and more recently, Google v European Union where the companies were heavily fined. Questions have been raised with regards to the consistency of antitrust between jurisdictions where the same antitrust corporate behaviour, and similar antitrust legal environment, is prosecuted in one jurisdiction but not another.

===State governments===
State attorneys general may file suits to enforce both state and federal antitrust laws.

*Parens patriae
*&quot;Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal.&quot;, 405 U.S. 251 (1972) state governments do not have a cause of action to sue for consequential loss for damage to their general economies after an antitrust violation is found.

===Private suits===
Private privates can file lawsuits, in both state and federal court, against violators of state and federal antitrust law. Federal antitrust laws, as well as most state laws, provide for &quot;treble&quot; (triple) damages against antitrust violators in order to encourage private lawsuit enforcement of antitrust law. Thus, if a company is sued for monopolizing a market and the jury concludes the conduct resulted in consumers&#x27; being overcharged $200,000, that amount will automatically be tripled, so the injured consumers will receive $600,000. The United States Supreme Court summarized why Congress authorized private antitrust lawsuits in the case &quot;Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal.&quot;, 405 U.S. 251, 262 (1972):

*&quot;Pfizer, Inc. v. Government of India&quot;, 434 U.S. 308 (1978) foreign governments have standing to sue in private actions in the U.S. courts.
*&quot;Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, Inc.&quot;, 327 U.S. 251 (1946) treble damages awarded under the Clayton Act §4 needed not to be mathematically precise, but based on a reasonable estimate of loss, and not speculative. This meant a jury could set a higher estimate of how much movie theaters lost, when the film distributors conspired with other theaters to let them show films first.
*&quot;Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois&quot;, 431 U.S. 720 (1977) indirect purchasers of goods where prices have been raised have no standing to sue. Only the direct contractors of cartel members may, to avoid double or multiple recovery.
*&quot;Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.&quot;, 473 U.S. 614 (1985) on arbitration

==Theory==

The Supreme Court calls the Sherman Antitrust Act a &quot;charter of freedom&quot;, designed to protect free enterprise in America. One view of the statutory purpose, urged for example by Justice Douglas, was that the goal was not only to protect consumers, but at least as importantly to prohibit the use of power to control the marketplace.

Contrary to this are efficiency arguments that antitrust legislation should be changed to primarily benefit consumers, and have no other purpose. Free market economist Milton Friedman states that he initially agreed with the underlying principles of antitrust laws (breaking up monopolies and oligopolies and promoting more competition), but that he came to the conclusion that they do more harm than good. Thomas Sowell argues that, even if a superior business drives out a competitor, it does not follow that competition has ended:

Alan Greenspan argues that the very existence of antitrust laws discourages businessmen from some activities that might be socially useful out of fear that their business actions will be determined illegal and dismantled by government. In his essay entitled &quot;Antitrust,&quot; he says: &quot;No one will ever know what new products, processes, machines, and cost-saving mergers failed to come into existence, killed by the Sherman Act before they were born. No one can ever compute the price that all of us have paid for that Act which, by inducing less effective use of capital, has kept our standard of living lower than would otherwise have been possible.&quot; Those, like Greenspan, who oppose antitrust tend not to support competition as an end in itself but for its results—low prices. As long as a monopoly is not a coercive monopoly where a firm is securely insulated from &quot;potential&quot; competition, it is argued that the firm must keep prices low in order to discourage competition from arising. Hence, legal action is uncalled for and wrongly harms the firm and consumers.

Thomas DiLorenzo, an adherent of the Austrian School of economics, found that the &quot;trusts&quot; of the late 19th century were dropping their prices faster than the rest of the economy, and he holds that they were not monopolists at all. Ayn Rand, the American writer, provides a moral argument against antitrust laws. She holds that these laws in principle criminalize any person engaged in making a business successful, and, thus, are gross violations of their individual expectations. Such laissez-faire advocates suggest that only a coercive monopoly should be broken up, that is the persistent, exclusive control of a vitally needed resource, good, or service such that the community is at the mercy of the controller, and where there are no suppliers of the same or substitute goods to which the consumer can turn. In such a monopoly, the monopolist is able to make pricing and production decisions without an eye on competitive market forces and is able to curtail production to price-gouge consumers. Laissez-faire advocates argue that such a monopoly can only come about through the use of physical coercion or fraudulent means by the corporation or by government intervention, and that there is no case of a coercive monopoly ever existing that was not the result of government policies.

Judge Robert Bork&#x27;s writings on antitrust law (particularly &quot;The Antitrust Paradox&quot;), along with those of Richard Posner and other law and economics thinkers, were heavily influential in causing a shift in the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s approach to antitrust laws since the 1970s, to be focused solely on what is best for the consumer rather than the company&#x27;s practices.

<text>Price fixing is an anticompetitive agreement between participants on the same side in a market to buy or sell a product, service, or commodity only at a fixed price, or maintain the market conditions such that the price is maintained at a given level by controlling supply and demand.

The intent of price fixing may be to push the price of a product as high as possible, generally leading to profits for all sellers but may also have the goal to fix, peg, discount, or stabilize prices. The defining characteristic of price fixing is any agreement regarding price, whether expressed or implied.

Price fixing requires a conspiracy between sellers or buyers. The purpose is to coordinate pricing for mutual benefit of the traders. For example, manufacturers and retailers may conspire to sell at a common &quot;retail&quot; price; set a common minimum sales price, where sellers agree not to discount the sales price below the agreed-to minimum price; buy the product from a supplier at a specified maximum price; adhere to a price book or list price; engage in cooperative price advertising; standardize financial credit terms offered to purchasers; use uniform trade-in allowances; limit discounts; discontinue a free service or fix the price of one component of an overall service; adhere uniformly to previously announced prices and terms of sale; establish uniform costs and markups; impose mandatory surcharges; purposefully reduce output or sales in order to charge higher prices; or purposefully share or pool markets, territories, or customers.

Price fixing is permitted in some markets but not others; where allowed, it is often known as &quot;resale price maintenance&quot; or &quot;retail price maintenance&quot;.

Not all similar prices or price changes at the same time are price fixing. These situations are often normal market phenomena. For example, the price of agricultural products such as wheat basically do not differ too much, because such agricultural products have no characteristics and are essentially the same, and their price will only change slightly at the same time. If a natural disaster occurs, the price of all affected wheat will rise at the same time. And the increase in consumer demand may also cause the prices of products with limited supply to rise at the same time.

In neo-classical economics, price fixing is inefficient. The anti-competitive agreement by producers to fix prices above the market price transfers some of the consumer surplus to those producers and also results in a deadweight loss.

International price fixing by private entities can be prosecuted under the antitrust laws of many countries. Examples of prosecuted international cartels are those that controlled the prices and output of lysine, citric acid, graphite electrodes, and bulk vitamins.

==Legal status==
===United States===
In the United States, price fixing can be prosecuted as a criminal federal offense under Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.

Criminal prosecutions must be handled by the U.S. Department of Justice, but the Federal Trade Commission also has jurisdiction for civil antitrust violations. Many state attorneys general also bring antitrust cases and have antitrust offices, such as Virginia, New York, and California. Further, where price fixing is used as an artifice to defraud a U.S. government agency into paying more than market value, the U.S. attorney may proceed under the False Claims Act.

Private individuals or organizations may file lawsuits for triple damages for antitrust violations and, depending on the law, recover attorneys fees and costs expended on prosecution of a case. If the case at hand also violates the False Claims Act of 1863, in addition to the Sherman Act, private individuals may also bring a civil action in the name of the United States under the &quot;Qui Tam&quot; provision of The False Claims Act.

Under American law, exchanging prices among competitors can also violate the antitrust laws. That includes exchanging prices with the intent to fix prices or the exchange affecting the prices individual competitors set. Proof that competitors have shared prices can be used as part of the evidence of an illegal price fixing agreement. Experts generally advise that competitors avoid even the appearance of agreeing on price.

Since 1997, US courts have divided price fixing into two categories: vertical and horizontal maximum price fixing. Vertical price fixing includes a manufacturer&#x27;s attempt to control the price of its product at retail. In &quot;State Oil Co. v. Khan&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court held that vertical price fixing is no longer considered a &quot;per se&quot; violation of the Sherman Act, but horizontal price fixing is still considered a breach of the Sherman Act. Also in 2008, the defendants of &quot;United States v LG Display Co.&quot;, &quot;United States v. Chunghwa Picture Tubes&quot;, and &quot;United States v. Sharp Corporation&quot;, heard in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, agreed to pay a total sum of $585 million to settle their prosecutions for conspiring to fix prices of liquid crystal display panels. That was the second largest amount awarded under the Sherman Act in history.

===Canada===
In Canada, it is an indictable criminal offence under Section 45 of the Competition Act. Bid rigging is considered a form of price fixing and is illegal in Canada (s.47 Competition Act).

===Australia===
Price fixing is illegal in Australia under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, with considerably similar prohibitions to the US and Canadian prohibitions. The Act is administered and enforced by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission. Section 48 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) explicitly states, &quot;A corporation shall not engage in the practise of resale price maintenance.&quot; A broader understanding of the statutory provision is in Section 96(3)of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth), which broadly defines what can be resale price maintenance.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand law prohibits price fixing, among most other anti-competitive behaviours under the Commerce Act 1986. The act covers practices similar to that of US and Canadian law, and it is enforced by the Commerce Commission.

===European Union===
Under the EU commission&#x27;s leniency programme, whistleblowing firms that co-operate with the antitrust authority see their prospective penalties either wiped out or reduced.

===United Kingdom===
British competition law prohibits almost any attempt to fix prices.

The Net Book Agreement was a public agreement between UK booksellers from 1900 to 1991 to sell new books only at the recommended retail price to protect the revenues of smaller bookshops. The agreement collapsed in 1991, when the large book chain Dillons began discounting books, followed by rival Waterstones.

However, price-fixing is still legal in the magazine and newspaper distribution industry, and sometimes in the motion picture industry. Retailers who sell at below cover price are subject to withdrawal of supply. The Office of Fair Trading has given its approval to the &quot;status quo&quot;.

==Exemptions==
When the agreement to control price is sanctioned by a multilateral treaty or is entered by sovereign nations as opposed to individual firms, the cartel may be protected from lawsuits and criminal antitrust prosecution. That is why OPEC, the global petroleum cartel, has not been prosecuted or successfully sued under US antitrust law.

International airline tickets have their prices fixed by agreement with the IATA, a practice for which there is a specific exemption in antitrust law.

==Examples==

=== Compact discs ===
Between 1995 and 2000, music companies were found to have used illegal marketing agreements such as minimum advertised pricing to artificially inflate prices of compact discs in order to end price wars by discounters such as Best Buy and Target in the early 1990s. It is estimated customers were overcharged by nearly $500 million and up to $5 per album. A settlement in 2002 included the music publishers and distributors; Sony Music, Warner Music, Bertelsmann Music Group, EMI Music, Universal Music as well as retailers Musicland, Trans World Entertainment and Tower Records. In restitution for price fixing they agreed to pay a $67.4 million fine distribute $75.7 million in CDs to public and non-profit groups.

=== Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) ===

In October 2005, the Korean company Samsung pleaded guilty to conspiring with other companies, including Infineon and Hynix Semiconductor, to fix the price of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips. Samsung was the third company to be charged in connection with the international cartel and was fined $300 million, the second largest antitrust penalty in US history.

In October 2004, four executives from Infineon, a German chip maker, received reduced sentences of 4 to 6 months in federal prison and $250,000 in fines after agreeing to aid the U.S. Department of Justice with their ongoing investigation of the conspiracy.

=== Capacitors ===
In March 2018, the European Commission fined eight firms, mostly Japanese companies, €254 million for operating an illegal price cartel for capacitors. The two largest players were Nippon Chemi-Con which was fined €98 million and Hitachi Chemical which was fined €18 million.

=== Perfume ===
In 2006, the government of France fined 13 perfume brands and three vendors for price collusion between 1997 and 2000. The brands include L&#x27;Oréal (€4.1 million), Chanel (€3.0 million), LVMH&#x27;s Sephora (€9.4 million), and Hutchison Whampoa&#x27;s &quot;Marionnaud&quot; (€12.8 million).

=== Liquid crystal displays ===
In 2008 in the US, LG Display Co., Chunghwa Picture Tubes and Sharp Corp., agreed to plead guilty and pay $585 million in criminal fines for conspiring to fix prices of liquid crystal display panels.

South Korea–based LG Display would pay $400 million, the second-highest criminal fine that the US Justice Department antitrust division has ever imposed. Chunghwa would pay $65 million for conspiring with LG Display and other unnamed companies and Sharp would pay $120 million, according to the department.

In 2010, the EU fined LG Display €215 million for its part in the LCD price fixing scheme. Other companies were fined for a combined total of €648.9 million, including Chimei Innolux, AU Optronics, Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd., and HannStar Display Corp. LG Display said it is considering appealing the fine.

=== Air cargo market ===
In late 2005/early 2006, Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic came forward about their involvement in large price-fixing schemes for cargo and passenger surcharges in which 21 airlines were involved since 2000 (amongst which were British Airways, Korean Air, and Air France-KLM). U.S. Department of Justice fined the airlines a total of $1.7 billion, charged 19 executives with wrongdoing and four received prison terms.

In December 2008, the New Zealand Commerce Commission filed legal proceedings against 13 airlines in the New Zealand High Court. According to the Commission, the carriers &quot;colluded to raise the price of [freight] by imposing fuel charges for more than seven years&quot;. In 2013 Air New Zealand was the final airline of the 13 to settle.

The Commission noted that it might involve up to 60 airlines. In 2009 the Commission said overseas competition authorities were also investigating the air cargo market, including the US and Australia where fines had been imposed.

=== Tuna ===
An attempt to fix the price of tuna resulted in a $25 million fine for Bumble Bee Foods in 2017 and a $100 million fine for StarKist in 2020. Christopher Lischewski, the former CEO of Bumble Bee, was sentenced to 40 months in jail and fined $100,000 for his 2010–2013 involvement.

===Coronavirus vaccine===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, companies such as Pfizer and Moderna announced rates for their coronavirus vaccines that would differ based on deals established with various governments. Executive orders were enacted in the United States to lower prescription drug costs which was claimed by Pfizer&#x27;s CEO to cause &quot;enormous destruction&quot; to the pharmaceutical industry.

=== 1990s airlines ===
Airlines in the 1990&#x27;s were blocked by the US Department of Justice from continuing to use software to share data on routes and prices before they became public.

=== Rent algorithm ===
&quot;ProPublica&quot; in 2022 investigated the use of algorithms created by RealPage by rental companies across the United States to set rents, which critics worry has helped to raise rents by limiting competition. The US DOJ escalated its investigation into price-fixing in March of 2024, and filed an anti-trust lawsuit in August of 2024.

== Signs of possible price fixing during bidding ==
It is more common to have price fixing trends during the bidding process, such as:

* If the bid or quoted price is much higher than expected, the reason may be collusive to set the price or just overpriced, but it is legal in itself.
* If all suppliers choose to increase prices at the same time, it is beyond the scope of input cost changes.
* If the price of a new supplier is lower than the usual corporate bidding price, the reason may be that there is a collusion of bidding among existing companies.
* If the price of a new supplier drops significantly after bidding, the reason may be that some suppliers have been colluding and the new supplier has forced them to compete.

== Impact of price fixing ==
When prices are determined between various companies, it may affect consumers&#x27; choices to a certain extent, and affect small businesses that rely on these suppliers.

Taking freight as an example, many products are now transported by freight through various channels. If the freight price is artificially increased, it will have an impact on the entire supply chain. For example, it will cause the price of goods and services to increase, and it will also affect consumers&#x27; choices.

==Criticism on legislation==
Economic liberals believe that price fixing is a voluntary and consensual activity between parties that should be free from government compulsion and government interference. At times price fixing ensures a stable market for both consumers and producers. Any short-term benefit of increased price competition will force some producers out of the market and cause product shortages and prices for consumers to rise. In the end price-fixing legislation forces producers out of a market because it can not compete with the biggest discounter and the market winds up a monopoly anyway.

<doc id="92027" wikidata="Q94297" url="?curid=92027" title="Interstate 45">
<text>Interstate 45 (I-45) is a major Interstate Highway located entirely within the U.S. state of Texas. While most primary Interstate routes which have numbers ending in &quot;5&quot; are cross-country north–south routes, I-45 is comparatively short, with the entire route located within Texas. Additionally, it has the shortest length of all the primary Interstates that have numbers ending in a &quot;5&quot;. It connects the cities of Dallas and Houston, continuing southeast from Houston to Galveston over the Galveston Causeway to the Gulf of Mexico.

I-45 replaced U.S. Highway 75 (US 75) over its entire length, although portions of US 75 remained parallel to I-45 until its elimination south of Downtown Dallas in 1987. At the south end of I-45, State Highway 87 (SH 87, formerly part of US 75) continues into downtown Galveston. The north end is at I-30 in Downtown Dallas, where US 75 used the Good-Latimer Expressway. A short continuation, known by traffic reporters as the I-45 overhead, signed as part of US 75 and also part of unsigned I-345, continues north to the merge with the current end of US 75. Traffic can use Spur 366 (better known locally as the Woodall Rodgers Freeway) to connect to I-35E at the north end of I-345.

The portion of I-45 between Downtown and Galveston is known to Houston residents as the Gulf Freeway. The short elevated section of I-45, which forms the southern boundary of Downtown, is known as the Pierce Elevated after the surface street next to which the freeway runs, while north of I-10 it is known as the North Freeway. I-45 and I-345 in the Dallas area, north of the interchanges with I-20 and SH 310 (old US 75), is the Julius Schepps Freeway. The Gulf Freeway and North Freeway both include reversible high-occupancy vehicle lane (HOV lanes) for busses and other HOVs to and from Downtown.

The freeway is the subject of ongoing controversy and federal investigation due to a proposed expansion project in Harris County, which would displace hundreds of people from their homes and worsen air quality. The local authorities have opposed the expansion project, while the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) supports expansion, and negotiations are pending. The project&#x27;s estimated cost is at least $9.7 billion and is expected to take at least two decades to complete.

==Route description==
In addition to the official control cities of Galveston, Houston, and Dallas, I-45 serves a number of other communities, including La Marque, League City, Spring, The Woodlands, Conroe, Willis, Huntsville, Madisonville, Centerville, Buffalo, Fairfield, Corsicana, and Ennis.

US 190 joins I-45 for from Huntsville to Madisonville. US 287 joins I-45 for from Corsicana to Ennis. US 287 signs are only posted (with I-45) from the northern end of Business I-45-F (Bus. I-45-F) in Corsicana to the Ellis County line.
I-45 gained notoriety during Hurricane Rita in 2005. Thousands of Houston area evacuees jammed the roadway trying to leave. As a result, the freeway became a parking lot. Gas stations ran dry and hundreds of people&#x27;s cars simply ran empty, their occupants having to spend the night along the shoulder. Four-hour drives suddenly became 24-hour drives. Even though TxDOT started contraflow lane reversal at Farm to Market Road 1488 (FM 1488), it did not alleviate the traffic jam deep into the city, as that starting point was even north of The Woodlands, which is close to Conroe, the northern terminus of Greater Houston.

At just , I-45 is the shortest of the primary Interstates (ending in 0 or 5) and the only primary Interstate to be entirely inside of one state.

===Gulf Freeway===
The stretch of I-45 connecting Galveston with Houston is known as the Gulf Freeway. It was the first freeway built in Texas—opened in stages beginning on October 1, 1948, up to a full completion to Galveston in 1952, as part of US 75. At the north (Houston) end, it connects to the North Freeway via the short Pierce Elevated, completed in 1967. The section north of the curve near SH 3/Monroe Road in southeastern Houston was built on the right-of-way of the former Galveston–Houston Electric Railway, which entered downtown on Pierce Street.

After several interchanges, I-45 crosses the Galveston Causeway and passes Tiki Island. Old US 75 south of this junction was upgraded on the spot.

The Gulf Freeway generally parallels SH 3 (old US 75) about to the west, bypassing La Marque, Dickinson, and South Houston. It includes interchanges with several other freeways: FM 1764 (Emmett F. Lowry Expressway), State Highway NASA Road 1 (NASA Road 1), and the Sam Houston Tollway (Beltway 8), meeting the north end of SH 3 in southeastern Houston. (This part of SH 3—on Winkler Drive and Monroe Road—is not part of old US 75.) A center reversible HOV lane begins just south of the Sam Houston Tollway.
In Houston, I-45 meets I-610 and SH 35 at a complicated interchange. At the merge with Spur 5, a short freeway spur to the University of Houston, elevated collector–distributor roads (also part of Spur 5) begin. The collector–distributor roads and the HOV lane end at Emancipation Avenue, the original end of the Gulf Freeway. Just past Emancipation Avenue is an interchange with I-69/US 59 (Eastex and Southwest freeways) and SH 288 (South Freeway), after which I-45 technically becomes the North Freeway as it runs along the northwest half of the block between Pierce Street and Gray Street as the Pierce Elevated.

The reversible HOV lane begins in Downtown at the intersection of St. Joseph Parkway and Emancipation Avenue, with easy access inbound to St. Joseph Parkway and outbound from Pierce Street. It runs down the median of the Gulf Freeway, mostly at the same level as the mainlanes. Ramps are provided for access to and from the following roads:
* Eastwood Transit Center (full access)
* I-610 north frontage road (full access)
* Monroe Road and Monroe Park &amp; Ride (full access)
* Fuqua Park &amp; Ride and South Point Park &amp; Ride (full access)
* Frontage roads north of Dixie Farm Road (FM 1959) (toward Downtown, with a ramp stub for continuation)

===North Freeway===
The I-45 North Freeway HOV begins in downtown Houston near the University of Houston–Downtown, with easy access inbound on Milam Street and outbound on Travis Street. Ramps and entrances are provided for access from the following roads. All are fully accessible.
* I-10/US 90 westbound exit and entrance only
* Quitman Street
* Airline Drive (to Crosstimbers Road)
* North Shepherd (to North Shepherd Park &amp; Ride)
* FM 525 (Aldine-Bender Road)
* Kuykendahl Park &amp; Ride
* FM 1960 (to Spring Park &amp; Ride) 
The HOV ends approximately north of the FM 1960 (Cypress Creek Parkway) exit and becomes a diamond white line at grade separated HOV north to just before exit 84 Loop 336 on the south side of Conroe. This provides constant HOV access with one lane on the northbound side and one lane on the southbound side with periodic dotted lines for access at major exits.

===Julius Schepps Freeway===
The stretch of I-45 along the Julius Schepps Freeway in Dallas, from the Trinity River to Downtown Dallas up to and including I-345, is elevated above the surrounding areas for most of its length. As such, when ice storms hit the Dallas area (usually on average one to two times per year), the freeway is shut down, and traffic is diverted to SH 310 and US 175, which parallel I-45.

==History==
In the initial assignment of state highways in 1917, the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex and Greater Houston were connected by a branch of SH 2 (Meridian Highway), which ran via Waco and Bryan and continued on to Galveston. The more direct route followed by I-45 was not initially part of the system between Richland and Huntsville; this cutoff was added by 1919 as SH 32, and US 75 was assigned to the alignment in 1926. Prior to the coming of the Interstate Highway System in the late 1950s, the only improvements to US 75 in Texas beyond building a two-lane paved roadway were in the Houston and Dallas areas. The highways in and near these cities, however, included some of the first freeways in the state: the Gulf Freeway (Houston) and the Central Expressway (Dallas).

===Gulf Freeway (Houston to Galveston)===

The Galveston–Houston Electric Railway began operating an interurban between those cities on December 5, 1911, and last ran on October 31, 1936, though the Houston Electric Company, operator of Houston&#x27;s city transit system, continued to run trains on the portion between Downtown and Park Place. A proposal for a &quot;superhighway&quot; between the cities was first made in 1930, and Houston Mayor Oscar F. Holcombe began to work toward it later that decade. He announced an agreement with the Houston Electric Company on April 12, 1940, through which the company could convert its four remaining lines to busses in exchange for the right-of-way used by the Park Place line. This line was last used on June 9, 1940, the last day of streetcar service in Houston; the replacement is still operated by the Houston Metro as the 40 along Telephone Road.

Before the new highway was built, US 75 followed Galveston Road (now mostly SH 3), Broadway Street, and Harrisburg Boulevard into Downtown. SH 225 carried traffic from La Porte along La Porte Road to US 75 in Harrisburg, and SH 35 connected Alvin with Downtown along Telephone Road and Leeland Street. Plans made in October 1943, when the Texas Transportation Commission signed an agreement with Houston and Harris County, referred to the new bypass as a relocation of US 75. Drawings were released by the state on January 31, 1946, and included almost continuous frontage roads, broken only at railroad crossings. Although the freeway ended at Live Oak Street, a so-called &quot;four-street distribution system&quot; of four one-way streets, timed for , carried traffic to Main Street. Initially, the two southwestern streets—Pierce Street and Calhoun Avenue (now St. Joseph Parkway)—carried traffic toward the freeway, and the other two—Jefferson and Pease streets—carried exiting traffic; once the freeway was completed far enough to allow US 75 to be marked along it, Pease and Pierce streets carried that highway to Fannin Street.

The first freeway dedication in the state took place at 7:00 pm on September 30, 1948, at the overpass over Calhoun Road by the University of Houston. The roadway between Downtown and Telephone Road was opened to traffic after speeches but lacked an official name, being called the &quot;Interurban Expressway&quot;, after the rail line that it replaced, by the press. Mayor Holcombe quickly started a contest to assign a name, and the city chose the winning entry on December 17, 1948. Sara Yancy of Houston Heights won $100 (equivalent to $ in ) for her submission of &quot;Gulf Freeway&quot;, named for the Gulf of Mexico that the highway would reach when completed. The freeway was extended to Griggs Road in February 1951 and Reveille Street (onto which SH 35 was realigned) in July 1951 and was completed to the Galveston Causeway on August 2, 1952, with a ceremony on the bridge over FM 517 near Dickinson. However, beyond Reveille Street, the road was not built to freeway standards, with 32 at-grade intersections, though no traffic signals. The highway curved away from the old interurban right-of-way near Monroe Road, about where the Park Place streetcar line had ended. In December 1952, a short spur, now part of I-610, was opened to connect with SH 225. A three-way split in the northwest part of Park Place, near where Gulfgate Shopping Center opened in 1956, carried nonstop traffic to and from SH 35 and SH 225. This split was also the location of a lane drop; the roadway carried six lanes (three in each direction) between Houston and the interchange and four beyond to Galveston. After the new US 75 was completed, the old road between Downtown and South Houston was dropped from the state highway system, while the remainder became SH 3, connecting to the Gulf Freeway via Winkler Drive, effective August 20, 1952.

The first major change was made in preparation for the North Freeway connection, when the directions of Calhoun Avenue and Jefferson Street were swapped so that they would alternate. A bridge, dated 1954, was built to carry traffic from Jefferson Street over traffic to Jefferson Street, and US 75 was moved to Calhoun Avenue northbound, soon crossing downtown on the one-way pair of Calhoun Avenue and Pierce Street to the new North Freeway. A median barrier was added in 1956 to prevent crossover accidents. Southeast of Downtown, the at-grade intersections proved dangerous, and only two had been replaced with interchanges by 1959, when the Texas Highway Department began a program to upgrade the road to full freeway standards. Frontage roads would be required along the entire highway, since the state had not purchased access rights, and so abutting property owners were able to build driveways to the road. To accomplish this, traffic was shifted to the newly built frontage roads so that the central main lanes could be reconstructed. This grade separation was completed from Houston to Almeda-Genoa Road (exit 34) in June 1959, FM 1959 (exit 30) in October 1964, FM 518 (exit 23) in December 1970, and FM 1764 (exit 15) in 1976. As the section beyond FM 1764 into Galveston had already been rebuilt, this marked the completion of the Gulf Freeway as an actual freeway.
As the first freeway in Texas, the standards of the Gulf Freeway soon became inadequate, with poor sight lines and little room to merge when entering. It also attracted development, such as Gulfgate Center, the first mall in the Houston area, the Manned Spacecraft Center, and many residential developments. Heavy congestion began to affect the freeway by the early 1960s; two roughly parallel freeways—the Harrisburg and Alvin freeways—were proposed at that time to relieve the traffic but were not built. A short project to widen the road to six lanes between I-610 and Sims Bayou was completed in 1960, and ramp meters were installed in 1966. The I-610 interchange was rebuilt with direct connections for most movements in 1975. Plans to reconstruct the freeway near Downtown began in 1972, taking about 170 houses and 22 businesses from the southwest side for the room to expand the main lanes and add parallel lanes for the Alvin Freeway. Local opposition was unsuccessful at stopping the project, and construction on this segment, and others to the southeast, took place in the 1980s. The lanes were shifted outward to make room for the transitway, which opened to I-610 on May 16, 1988. These lanes were inspired by the similar ones on the Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway in the Washington metropolitan area. That year also marked the end of the reconstruction inside I-610, along with the elevated distribution lanes alongside the mainlanes near Downtown; the first short piece of the Alvin Freeway was finally connected to these in 1999. This project gave I-45 its current configuration, mostly eight mainlanes wide, from Sims Bayou past I-610 to Griggs Road in 1981, to Telephone Road in 1982, to Lockwood Drive in 1985, and, finally, to Downtown in 1988.

These projects, however, were not the end of construction on the Gulf Freeway. The highway beyond I-610 to FM 1959, which had just been upgraded in the 1950s and 1960s, saw an extension of the transitway to a temporary end near FM 1959, widening to eight lanes, and a large stack interchange at the Sam Houston Tollway. This reconstruction was completed between Almeda-Genoa Road and College Avenue in 1991, between College Avenue and Sims Bayou in 1994, and, finally in 1997, there was no construction anywhere on the entire length of the freeway when the tollway interchange was opened, along with the widening between Almeda-Genoa Road and FM 1959. A 1999 study recommended widening the entire stretch from the Sam Houston Tollway to Galveston to at least eight lanes. Construction to replace the Galveston Causeway began in mid-2003, and work on a section through Webster, including a new interchange with NASA Road 1, began in mid-2007.

Widening of the freeway between Kurland Drive at Bay Area Boulevard began in July 2011. This construction will expand the number of freeway lanes from six to ten and increase the number of frontage lanes from four to six. The HOV lane will be extended to the southern end of the construction. It will also involve rebuilding the overpasses at Dixie Farm Road and Clear Lake City Boulevard. (Dixie Farm Road bridge demolition has already been completed.) According to TxDOT, the project is approximately in length, starting at Kurland and ending approximately south of Bay Area Boulevard.

The project has six phases. Phase one is the reconstruction of the mainlanes from the northern end of the project to just south of FM 1959. The end of this phase will include the demolition and reconstruction of the bridge at the FM 1959 intersection. Phase two, planned to begin in mid-2012, will be the reconstruction of the frontage roads from just south of FM 1959 to the southern end of the project. Phase three will be the reconstruction of the mainlanes on the southern half of the project and is planned to begin in mid-2013. Phase four, scheduled to start late 2014, will be the demolition and reconstruction of the overpass at Clear Lake City Boulevard. Phase five (which was completed) was the demolition and reconstruction of El Dorado and Bay Area boulevards. The demolition and reconstruction was finished in 2016. As a result, the 1960s-era cloverleaf interchanges (with the exception of Fuqua Street and Scarsdale Boulevard) have been eliminated with overpasses. Phase six will be making the new lanes of the freeway. It will have five lanes each direction along with the new overpasses for those two underpasses. This will be completed 2017.

In 2015, reconstruction and widening of I-45 began in Downtown due to heavy traffic. The southbound onramp from Allen Parkway will be moved to enter on the right side, and long-range plans call for the demolition of the outdated Pierce Elevated, with the reroute of I-45 being along I-69/US 59 and I-10/US 90 to the North Freeway. The parts of the Gulf Freeway at I-10 and I-45 will be known as the Downtown Connector. If I-45 was rerouted and the Pierce Elevated demolished (and/or redeveloped into the proposed Pierce SkyPark as part of additional greenspace), the connecting ramps south of Allen Parkway would become a second downtown spur, which will result in the demise of a full freeway loop around Downtown. , there are no plans to place the Pierce Elevated in a tunnel similar to Spur 366 in Dallas since Greater Houston is prone to flooding, especially in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.

===North Freeway (Houston to Conroe)===

The last alignment of US 75 before the North Freeway was built left Downtown to the northwest on Main Street, turning north at Airline Drive, and then northwest along the present alignment of I-45, then known as Stuebner Airline Road, Shepherd Drive, and East Montgomery Road. The freeway replacement was authorized in stages between May 1945 and June 1952, when the Texas Transportation Commission adopted plans for a freeway all the way between Houston and Dallas. The North Freeway name was adopted in 1956; an unsuccessful proposal in 1965 would have renamed it the Dallas Freeway. The first short piece of the freeway to open crossed Buffalo Bayou, connecting the two one-way pairs from the north end of the Gulf Freeway with the south end of Houston Avenue. This section was opened on December 12, 1955, and allowed US 75 to bypass its run on Main Street; it included interchanges with Allen Parkway and Memorial Drive. The next piece near downtown opened on July 24, 1962, leaving the 1955 freeway in the Allen Parkway interchange, passing east of Houston Avenue, and connected to an already-built portion at I-610. The six-lane Pierce Elevated, which occupies half a block on the southwest side of Pierce Street, required the acquisition of a number of commercial properties; the cost prevented the full block from being used. This portion opened on August 18, 1967, connecting the Gulf and North Freeways and bypassing the &quot;four-street distribution system&quot;, which remains in its original form to this day.

The first piece of the North Freeway to be built outside I-610 was an upgrade of existing US 75 on Stuebner Airline Road, between Airline and Shepherd drives, opened in December 1959. In April 1961, this was completed to the interchange with I-610, and, on July 24, 1962, the Downtown section was extended north to meet it. As each section opened, US 75 was moved to it, temporarily using I-610 to Airline Drive for about a year. At the other end, US 75 was upgraded from Spring Creek at the north edge of Spring north to the San Jacinto River south of Conroe in 1960. In between, the upgrade was completed from FM 525 to near Richey Road in December 1961, south to the 1959 segment in February 1963, and north to the 1960 segment in March 1963, completing the North Freeway except for the Pierce Elevated (1967). The freeway as initially built had eight lanes (four in each direction) between Downtown and I-610, six to FM 1960, and four north of FM 1960.
Like the Gulf Freeway, the North Freeway soon became congested. The oil boom of the 1970s resulted in large-scale residential development along the highway, most notably The Woodlands. Since the corridor was strongly directional, with 65 percent of peak-hour traffic going in the peak direction, a contraflow lane for busses and other HOVs was implemented later that decade, opening on August 28, 1979, between Downtown and Shepherd Drive (exit 56B). The facility, operating during both rush-hour periods, occupied the leftmost lane of the other direction and was separated from the other lanes with a movable pylon every . In 1980, the existing center breakdown lanes were restriped for HOV traffic for about from the north end of the contraflow lane. Off-peak traffic, however, was increasing, and construction began in 1983 on a more permanent reversible transitway in the median. Thus, the second transitway in Houston (a month after the one on the Katy Freeway), opened on November 23, 1984, replacing the contraflow lane.

Reconstruction of the mainlanes and frontage roads to handle increased traffic began in 1982 just north of Downtown. No lanes were added south of I-610, but the eight-lane cross-section, with room for a transitway, was continued north as construction progressed. Work was completed south of Airline Drive (exit 53) in about 1985, to Shepherd Drive (exit 56B) in 1987, and to FM 525 (exit 60A) in 1990; this last opening allowed the transitway to extend to just south of FM 525. The Hardy Toll Road, completed on June 28, 1988, between I-610 and I-45 near The Woodlands, added capacity to that part of the corridor, and, in 1990, reconstruction was completed on a short piece of I-45 from the toll road into The Woodlands. Reconstruction continued from FM 525, reaching Airtex Boulevard (exit 63) in 1997, including part of the Sam Houston Tollway interchange (completed in 2003) and a transitway extension, Cypresswood Drive (exit 68) in 1998, extending the transit way to its present terminus, and the Hardy Toll Road (exit 72) in 2003. Work on the section through The Woodlands to Research Forest Drive (exit 77) was completed in 2001, including a direct connection to Woodlands Parkway, and, in 2003, work was completed to FM 1488 (exit 81). Construction is now complete between FM 1488 to the Walker County line near milepost 100 just south of the northbound truck weigh station and New Waverly, near SH 75 (exit 98).

, widening of the North Freeway from Downtown to the Sam Houston Tollway began. The plan for the project is to widen the freeway by adding managed lanes and adding the North Shepherd on- and offramps also known as Spur 261 (which was already completed) prior to the I-45 widening project. This project has generated major controversy, with proponents claiming it would &quot;enhance safety and mobility&quot;, while opponents point out that it would worsen air quality and greenhouse gas emissions, displace hundreds of people, and fail to meaningfully address congestion. 

Authorities in Harris County have sued TxDOT to stop the expansion, and the federal government has investigated the expansion project to determine whether it violates any civil rights or environmental laws. Among others, the expansion has been opposed by U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo. If completed, the highway&#x27;s width will double to , wider than a football field. The highway expansion would displace around a thousand residents, including 919 units in 16 apartment complexes, 160 single-family homes, five places of worship, and two schools. An apartment complex was acquired and vacated by TxDOT, which plans to demolish it for the expansion. TxDOT was heavily criticized for this planned demolition, as the apartment complex slated for demolition had been described as an example of good urban planning. 

Parts of the freeway are paralleled by the METRORail Red Line.

===Between Conroe and Richland===
The first part of I-45 between Conroe and Richland was the bypass around Huntsville.

The final piece of I-45 between the cities opened on October 13, 1971, for between Fairfield and Streetman.

===Richland to Dallas (Julius Schepps Freeway)===
The Central Expressway was the first freeway in Dallas, built as a new alignment of US 75. It first opened between San Jacinto Street and Fitzhugh Avenue in 1949 and soon stretched south to Hutchins. The stretch through downtown, however, ran along the surface, as did the part south of the bridge over the Trinity River, due to diversion of funds to the north portion. By the late 1950s, a bypass to the east of the downtown section was planned. By the time construction reached Hutchins, in about 1955, the state decided to build further segments to full freeway standards. By 1961, the freeway was complete between Hutchins and the SH 14 split at Richland, except for the bypass around Corsicana, which was built . This freeway was mostly built along the existing US 75; one of the projects in Navarro County, near Corsicana, was the first Interstate project in Texas approved under the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956.
It was not until 1964 that I-345, extending I-45 north along the proposed Central Expressway bypass, was added as a proposed state highway. I-45 and I-345 were built and opened in the 1970s, with the final section, between Lamar Street (exit 283A) and the Central Expressway (exit 283B), opening on February 25, 1976. At the north end, before it merged into the Central Expressway (which continued to carry US 75), I-345 straddled the bridges over Bryan Street and Ross Avenue, the latter the location of the opening ceremonies in 1949. Because of their location, these two bridges were not replaced in the 1990s reconstruction of the North Central Expressway and are the only surviving grade separations from the initial construction north from downtown.

At the time the interchange with I-20 was built, the freeway that crossed I-45 was then a part of I-635; it would not be until later when, initially, I-20 was added to I-635 as a multiplex, then later still, I-635 would be truncated away from the I-45 interchange (back around to just north of what is now I-20&#x27;s interchange with US 175).

Reconstruction and widening to six lanes, from the Ellis–Navarro county line (between exits 243 and 244) north to SH 310 (exit 275), began in 1991. The last section, near the north end, was completed in 2002.

<text>A teaching method is a set of principles and methods used by teachers to enable student learning. These strategies are determined partly by the subject matter to be taught, partly by the relative expertise of the learners, and partly by constraints caused by the learning environment. For a particular teaching method to be appropriate and efficient it has to take into account the learner, the nature of the subject matter, and the type of learning it is supposed to bring about.

The approaches for teaching can be broadly classified into teacher-centered and student-centered, although in practice teachers will often adapt instruction by moving back and forth between these methodologies depending on learner prior knowledge, learner expertise, and the desired learning objectives. In a teacher-centered approach to learning, teachers are the main authority figure in this model. Students are viewed as &quot;empty vessels&quot; whose primary role is to passively receive information (via lectures and direct instruction) with the end goal of testing and assessment. It is the primary role of teachers to pass knowledge and information on to their students. In this model, teaching and assessment are viewed as two separate entities. Student learning is measured through objectively scored tests and assessments. In the Student-Centered Approach to Learning, while teachers are the authority figure in this model, teachers and students play an equally active role in the learning process. This approach is also called authoritative. The teacher&#x27;s primary role is to coach and facilitate student learning and overall comprehension of material. Student learning is measured through both formal and informal forms of assessment, including group projects, student portfolios, and class participation. Teaching and assessments are connected; student learning is continuously measured during teacher instruction.

==Methods of teaching==
===Lecturing===

The lecture method is just one of several teaching methods, though in schools it&#x27;s usually considered the primary one. The lecture method is convenient for the institution and cost-efficient, especially with larger classroom sizes. This is why lecturing is the standard for most college courses when there can be several hundred students in the classroom at once; lecturing lets professors address the most people at once, in the most general manner, while still conveying the information that they feel is most important, according to the lesson plan. While the lecture method gives the instructor or teacher chances to expose students to unpublished or not readily available material, the students play a passive role which may hinder learning. While this method facilitates large-class communication, the lecturer must make a constant and conscious effort to become aware of student problems and engage the students to give verbal feedback. It can be used to arouse interest in a subject provided the instructor has effective writing and speaking skills.

=== Peer Instruction ===

Developed by Eric Mazur, peer instruction is a teaching method designed to improve the lecture. It includes both pre-class and in-class workflows. The in-class workflow intersperses teacher presentations with conceptual questions, called Concept Tests. These are designed to expose common student misconceptions in understanding the material, and lead to student discussion then reteaching if required. 

=== Explaining ===
While under-researched, both student and teacher explanations remain one of the most utilized teaching methods in teacher practice. Explaining has many sub-categories including the use of analogies to build conceptual understanding. Some modes of explaining include the ‘thinking together’ style where teachers connect student ideas to scientific models. There are also more narrative styles using examples, and learner explanations which require students to give an explanation of the concept to be learned allowing the teacher to give precise feedback on the quality of the explanation.

===Demonstrating===

Demonstrating, which is also called the coaching style or the Lecture-cum-Demonstration method, is the process of teaching through examples or experiments. The framework mixes the instructional strategies of &quot;information imparting&quot; and &quot;showing how&quot;. For example, a science teacher may teach an idea by experimenting with students. A demonstration may be used to prove a fact through a combination of visual evidence and associated reasoning.

Demonstrations are similar to written storytelling and examples in that they allow students to personally relate to the presented information. Memorization of a list of facts is a detached and impersonal experience, whereas the same information, conveyed through demonstration, becomes personally relatable. Demonstrations help to raise student interest and reinforce memory retention because they provide connections between facts and real-world applications of those facts. Lectures, on the other hand, are often geared more towards factual presentation than connective learning.

One of the advantages of the demonstration method involves the capability to include different formats and instruction materials to make the learning process engaging. This leads to the activation of several of the learners&#x27; senses, creating more learning opportunities. The approach is also beneficial on the part of the teacher because it is adaptable to both group and individual teaching. While demonstration teaching, however, can be effective in teaching Math, Science, and Art, it can prove ineffective in a classroom setting that calls for the accommodation of the learners&#x27; individual needs.

===Collaborating===

Collaboration allows student to actively participate in the learning process by talking with each other and listening to others opinions. Collaboration establishes a personal connection between students and the topic of study and it helps students think in a less personally biased way. Group projects and discussions are examples of this teaching method. Teachers may employ collaboration to assess student&#x27;s abilities to work as a team, leadership skills, or presentation abilities.

Collaborative discussions can take a variety of forms, such as fishbowl discussions. It is important for teachers to provide students with instruction on how to collaborate. This includes teaching them rules to conversation, such as listening, and how to use argumentation versus arguing. After some preparation and with clearly defined roles, a discussion may constitute most of a lesson, with the teacher only giving short feedback at the end or in the following lesson.

Some examples of collaborative learning tips and strategies for teachers are; to build trust, establish group interactions, keeps in mind the critics, include different types of learning, use real-world problems, consider assessment, create a pre-test, and post-test, use different strategies, help students use inquiry and use technology for easier learning.

==== Classroom discussion ====
The most common type of collaborative method of teaching in a class is classroom discussion. It is also a democratic way of handling a class, where each student is given equal opportunity to interact and put forth their views. A discussion taking place in a classroom can be either facilitated by a teacher or by a student. A discussion could also follow a presentation or a demonstration. Class discussions can enhance student understanding, add context to academic content, broaden student perspectives, highlight opposing viewpoints, reinforce knowledge, build confidence, and support community in learning. The opportunities for meaningful and engaging in-class discussion may vary widely, depending on the subject matter and format of the course. Motivations for holding planned classroom discussion, however, remain consistent. An effective classroom discussion can be achieved by probing more questions among the students, paraphrasing the information received, using questions to develop critical thinking with questions like &quot;Can we take this one step further?;&quot; &quot;What solutions do you think might solve this problem?;&quot; &quot;How does this relate to what we have learned about..?;&quot; &quot;What are the differences between ... ?;&quot; &quot;How does this relate to your own experience?;&quot; &quot;What do you think causes ... ?;&quot; &quot;What are the implications of ... ?&quot;

It is clear from &quot;the impact of teaching strategies on learning strategies in first-year higher education cannot be overlooked nor over interpreted, due to the importance of students&#x27; personality and academic motivation which also partly explain why students learn the way they do&quot; that Donche agrees with the previous points made in the above headings but he also believes that student&#x27;s personalities contribute to their learning style. The way a student interprets and executes the instruction given by a teacher allows them to learn in a more effective and personal way. This interactive instruction is designed for the students to share their thoughts about a wide range of subjects.

Class discussions have also proven to be an effective method of bullying prevention and intervention when teachers discuss the issue of bullying and its negative consequences with the entire class. These discussions have shown to increase the number of students who would help other students when they are victimized.

====Debriefing====

The term &quot;debriefing&quot; refers to conversational sessions that revolve around the sharing and examining of information after a specific event has taken place. Depending on the situation, debriefing can serve a variety of purposes. It takes into consideration the experiences and facilitates reflection and feedback. Debriefing may involve feedback to the students or among the students, but this is not the intent. The intent is to allow the students to &quot;thaw&quot; and to judge their experience and progress toward change or transformation. The intent is to help them come to terms with their experience. This process involves a cognizance of cycle that students may have to be guided to completely debrief. Teachers should not be overly critical of relapses in behaviour. Once the experience is completely integrated, the students will exit this cycle and get on with the next.

Debriefing is a daily exercise in most professions. It might be in psychology, healthcare, politics, or business. This is also accepted as an everyday necessity.

====Classroom Action Research====
Classroom Action Research is a method of finding out what works best in your own classroom so that you can improve student learning. We know a great deal about good teaching in general (e.g. McKeachie, 1999; Chickering and Gamson, 1987; Weimer, 1996), but every teaching situation is unique in terms of content, level, student skills, and learning styles, teacher skills and teaching styles, and many other factors. To maximize student learning, a teacher must find out what works best in a particular situation. Each teaching and research method, model and family is essential to the practice of technology studies. Teachers have their strengths and weaknesses, and adopt particular models to complement strengths and contradict weaknesses. Here, the teacher is well aware of the type of knowledge to be constructed. At other times, teachers equip their students with a research method to challenge them to construct new meanings and knowledge. In schools, the research methods are simplified, allowing the students to access the methods at their own levels.

=== Questioning ===
Questioning is one of the oldest documented teaching methods, and can be used by teachers in a variety of ways for a variety of purposes including, checking for understanding, clarifying terms, exposing misconceptions, and gathering evidence of learning to inform subsequent instructional decisions.

==== Socratic questioning ====
Named after Socrates, socratic questioning is described by his pupil Plato as a form of questioning where the teacher probes underlying misconceptions to lead students towards deeper understanding.

==== Cold calling ====
Cold calling is a teaching methodology based around the teacher asking questions to students without letting the students know beforehand who will be called upon to answer by the teacher. Cold calling aims to increase inclusion in the classroom and active learning as well as student engagement and participation. Cold calling in education is distinct from cold-calling in sales which is a form of business solicitation. Cold calling as a teaching methodology has been linked to increased student participation, increased student voluntary participation, increased student engagement, increased student in class gender equity and no decrease in student comfort levels in class. There is some evidence that the effectiveness of cold calling as teaching method is connected to the use of covert retrieval practice.

=== Feedback ===

Feedback is targeted information given to students about their current performance relative to their desired learning goals. It should aim to (and be capable of producing) improvement in students’ learning, as well as being bidirectional by giving teachers feedback on student performance which in turn helps teachers plan the next steps in learning. Feedback in its various forms can be a potent teaching method with potentially large impacts on student achievement. It can also have some negative side effects under certain conditions. 

== Effectiveness of teaching methods ==

Small effects or lack of statistically significant effects have been found when evaluating many teaching methods rigorously with randomized controlled trials. Many teaching methods targeting cognitive skills show quickly disappearing impacts.

== Evolution of teaching methods ==
===Ancient education===
About 3000 BC, with the advent of writing, education became more conscious or self-reflecting, with specialized occupations such as scribe and astronomer requiring particular skills and knowledge. Philosophy in ancient Greece led to questions of educational method entering national discourse.

In his literary work &quot;The Republic&quot;, Plato described a system of instruction that he felt would lead to an ideal state. In his dialogues, Plato described the Socratic method, a form of inquiry and debate intended to stimulate critical thinking and illuminate ideas.

Many commentators on the Christian New Testament make reference to the teaching methodology of Jesus Christ, who &quot;used a variety of teaching techniques to impress his teaching on his hearers&quot;. It has been the intent of many educators since Plato, such as the Roman educator Quintilian, who lived shortly after Jesus, to find specific, interesting ways to encourage students to use their intelligence and to help them to learn.

===Medieval education===
Comenius, in Bohemia, wanted all children to learn. In his &quot;The World in Pictures&quot;, he created an illustrated textbook of things children would be familiar with in everyday life and used it to teach children. Rabelais described how the student Gargantua learned about the world, and what is in it.

Much later, Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his &quot;Emile&quot;, presented methodology to teach children the elements of science and other subjects. During Napoleonic warfare, the teaching methodology of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi of Switzerland enabled refugee children, of a class believed to be unteachable, to learn. He described this in his account of an educational experiment at Stanz.

===19th century===
The Prussian education system was a system of mandatory education dating to the early 19th century. Parts of the Prussian education system have served as models for the education systems in a number of other countries, including Japan and the United States. The Prussian model required classroom management skills to be incorporated into the teaching process.

The University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge in England developed their distinctive method of teaching, the tutorial system, in the 19th century. This involves very small groups, from one to three students, meeting on a regular basis with tutors (originally college fellows, and now also doctoral students and post-docs) to discuss and debate pre-prepared work (either essays or problems). This is the central teaching method of these universities in both arts and science subjects, and has been compared to the Socratic method.

===Experimental pedagogy===

Experimental pedagogy is a pedagogical trend that appeared at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, whose task was to introduce, in addition to observation, the experimental method into the study of teaching. This field of study employs scientific methods to investigate teaching and learning, aiming to improve educational practices by testing different approaches and measuring their effectiveness.

The main credit for the constitution of experimental pedagogy as a special direction and the development of its theoretical foundations belongs to two German pedagogues, Ernst Meumann and Wilhelm August Lay, who are also considered the founders of experimental pedagogy. There are also Alfred Binet and Théodore Simon in France, Joseph Mayer Rice, Edward Thorndike and G. Stanley Hall in America, Édouard Claparède and Robert Dottrens in Switzerland, Alexander Petrovich Nechaev in Russia, etc.

Key characteristics of experimental pedagogy include being evidence-based, rigorous in study design, and oriented towards improvement. The field investigates the effectiveness of various teaching methods, the impact of instructional materials, and factors influencing student learning.

Experimental pedagogy has the potential to significantly impact education by offering evidence-based support for effective practices. Examples of its application include studies on the use of technology in the classroom, the influence of different teaching methods on student motivation, and the examination of factors affecting student achievement.

Examples of experimental pedagogy in educational action include:

* A study on the effectiveness of using technology in the classroom, comparing the learning outcomes of students using tablets with those who do not.
* A study on the impact of different teaching methods on student motivation, comparing motivation levels in classes using different approaches.
* A study on the factors influencing student achievement, examining factors such as student background, family income, and resource access.

===20th century===
Newer teaching methods may incorporate television, radio, internet, multi media, and other modern devices. Some educators believe that the use of technology, while facilitating learning to some degree, is not a substitute for educational methods that encourage critical thinking and a desire to learn. Inquiry learning is another modern teaching method. A popular teaching method that is being used by many teachers is hands on activities. Hands-on activities are activities that require movement, talking, and listening.

==Politics==
Curry County, like most of southwestern Oregon, is a Republican-led county, although in part due to a more liberal lean in the city of Port Orford, it does not give so small a proportion of its vote to Democrats as Eastern Oregon does. No Democratic presidential candidate has obtained an absolute majority in Curry County since Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s 1964 landslide, and the county has been carried by Democrats for Presidents twice since, with only one occurrence being after the &quot;Reagan Revolution&quot;. This occurred when Bill Clinton obtained a 32-vote plurality over George H. W. Bush in a three-way contest with billionaire businessman Ross Perot in 1992. Even so, the Republican lean in Curry County has shown a few signs of waning in recent years. In four of the last six presidential elections, Democrats were able to exceed 40 percent of the county’s votes.

In the United States House of Representatives, Curry County is located in Oregon&#x27;s 4th congressional district, which also includes the more left-leaning Eugene metropolitan area and is currently represented by Democrat Val Hoyle, serving since January 2023. In the Oregon State Senate, Curry County is located in the 1st Senate District, represented by Republican David Brock Smith. In the Oregon House of Representatives, it is located in the 1st District, represented by Republican and former Curry County Commissioner Court Boice.











==Economy==

After discovery of gold and other precious metals along the beaches and rivers of Curry County in the mid-19th century, white settlements developed along the coast. Traveling mainly by water or by coast-hugging land routes, residents remained relatively isolated from the rest of Oregon until the 20th century. As mining declined in the region, the economy became more dependent on farming, livestock grazing, forest products such as Port Orford cedar (also known as Lawson&#x27;s cypress) and myrtlewood, and tourism. Blueberries and nursery plants are among the important farm products, and most of the Easter lilies grown in the United States come from Curry County.

In 2001, the native tanoak in the county were afflicted by sudden oak death, caused by infection of &quot;Phytophthora ramorum&quot;. The pathogen, which by 2016 had killed hundreds of thousands of tanoaks in the county, thrives in moist places along the coast. It has killed other kinds of oaks such as California black oak in a region that includes many California counties as well as Curry County, and it has infected and damaged a variety of conifers and shrubs such as camellia. In Curry County, it threatens timber production, plant nurseries, and Christmas tree farms.

As of 2012, the Federal government owned 66 percent of the land in Curry County, while 22 percent was owned by private forest interests. About 7 percent was being farmed; the state of Oregon owned 1 percent, and 4 percent was devoted to other uses.

The Port of Brookings Harbor, a shallow-draft harbor at the mouth of the Chetco River, is considered one of the safest harbors on the coast. It is listed as a Harbor of Refuge by the United States Coast Guard.

<text>Crook County is one of the 36 counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. As of the 2020 census, the population was 24,738. The county seat is Prineville. The county is named after George Crook, a U.S. Army officer who served in the American Civil War and various Indian Wars.

Crook County comprises the Prineville, OR Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Bend—Prineville, OR Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
Crook County was established on October 9, 1882, by an act of the Oregon State Legislature. The county was named after General George Crook, a veteran of various battles against the indigenous peoples of Eastern Oregon in the middle of the 19th century. The county was formed from territory formerly part of Wasco County, including the hilly region where the foothills of the Blue Mountains intersect the Cascade Mountain Range.

Access into the region at first was difficult, which discouraged settlement. The first effort to develop routes into the area was in 1862 when a supply train with cattle crossed the Scott Trail. This was also the first group of non-natives to spend the winter in central Oregon. The discovery and development of the Santiam Pass in the 1860s improved access into the area.

Prineville, incorporated in 1880 and then the only incorporated town in the county, was established as the county seat. This decision was confirmed by the voters in the 1884 general election.

From the start cattle ranching has been one of the primary industries of the county, with huge herds grazing the countryside from the 1880s. Farming was also developed in certain valley regions friendly to agriculture.

Logging in the Ochoco Mountains and the timber mills that accompanied also greatly contributed to the economic and population growth of the county. The first recorded mention of a sawmill was made by George Barnes, speaking about the Swartz sawmill on Mill Creek, circa 1867.

==Geography==

The county is located in the geographic center of Oregon. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.3%) is water. The largest body of water in Crook County is the Prineville Reservoir. The county has been reduced from its original size of by the creation of Jefferson County in 1914 and Deschutes County in 1916. The present boundaries were established in 1927.

The oldest geological formation in Oregon is in the southeastern corner of Crook County, near its boundary with Grant County. This formation is an outcropping of Devonian limestone created from a larger reef when most of Oregon was covered by water.

Crook County was formerly a presidential bellwether county, voting with the winner since 1888, in 26 presidential elections. However, the county lost its longest bellwether status to Okanogan County, Washington after voting for George H. W. Bush in 1992. It has voted Republican ever since.













==Economy==
Forest products, agriculture, livestock raising and recreation/tourism services constitute Crook County&#x27;s total economy. Agriculture is supported by the development of irrigation districts, which permits the raising of hay, grain, mint, potatoes, and seed. Range and forest lands allow grazing for a sizable livestock industry. The Ochoco National Forest&#x27;s stand of ponderosa pine is the main source of lumber. Tourism and recreation help round out the economy. Thousands of hunters, fishers, boaters, sightseers and rockhounds are annual visitors to its streams, reservoirs and the Ochoco Mountains. The Prineville Chamber of Commerce provides access to over of mining claims to rockhounds, who can dig for free agates, limb casts, jasper and thundereggs.

<text>Interstate 49 (I-49) is a north–south Interstate Highway with multiple segments. The original portion is entirely within Louisiana with an additional signed portion extending from I-220 in Shreveport to the Arkansas state line, three newer sections are in Arkansas, and one section in Missouri. Its southern terminus is in Lafayette, Louisiana, at I-10 while its northern terminus is in Kansas City, Missouri, at I-435 and I-470. Future plans include portions of the remaining roadway in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas, to link Kansas City, Missouri with New Orleans.

Although not part of the original 1957 Interstate Highway plan, residents of Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana began campaigning for the highway in 1965 via the &quot;US 71 - I-29 Association&quot;. The campaign called for I-29 to be extended south from Kansas City to New Orleans following much of the route along U.S. Route 71 (US 71). The plan called for creating a limited access expressway from New Orleans to the Canadian border and on to Winnipeg (via Manitoba Highway 75). When I-49 is complete, the goal of the association will have been accomplished, with only a brief gap between the Grandview Triangle and I-29 at the Kansas City Downtown Loop served by US 71 (Bruce R. Watkins Memorial Drive) or other Interstates such as I-435 and I-70 in Kansas City.

===Louisiana===

The southern terminus of I-49 is located at a cloverleaf interchange with I-10 and US 167 in the southern Louisiana city of Lafayette. Southbound motorists continue through the interchange onto the Evangeline Thruway, which transitions from a limited-access portion of LA 182 to a major divided thoroughfare that picks up the US 90 corridor heading through the heart of Lafayette. I-49 begins its journey concurrent with US 167 as it travels northward through Carencro, Sunset, Grand Coteau, and Opelousas. US 167 departs from the Interstate&#x27;s alignment at exit 23 between Opelousas and Washington, and I-49 begins to take a northwesterly path through the heavily wooded rural terrain. Various state highways provide access to the small towns and cities located along the parallel US 71 and US 167 corridors, such as Lebeau, Ville Platte, Bunkie, and Cheneyville. After crossing US 167, I-49 travels between US 71 and US 165 into the Alexandria metropolitan area in central Louisiana.

I-49 travels through downtown Alexandria doubling as U.S. Highway 71 Bypass (US 71 Byp.) and is also concurrent with portions of US 167 and Louisiana Highway 28 (LA 28). Major interchanges with US 167 and US 71 lead to bridges that cross the Red River into the neighboring city of Pineville. Continuing northwest from Alexandria, I-49 parallels the Red River and LA 1 through Boyce and passes just west of the historic city of Natchitoches, which is reached via LA 6 at exit 138. Between Natchitoches and Shreveport, I-49 travels between LA 1 and US 171 and has junctions with US 371 and US 84, connecting with Coushatta and Mansfield, respectively.

In Shreveport, the Interstate heads directly into the downtown area and terminates at I-20, a route that facilitates eastbound traffic. However, through traffic bound for I-20 west and the northern segment of I-49 is directed to transfer onto LA 3132 at an interchange located about south of this terminus. LA 3132 is a western freeway bypass of Shreveport known as the Inner Loop Expressway that becomes I-220 upon intersecting I-20. On the northside of town, motorists may exit I-220 and follow the next segment of I-49, which parallels US 71 into Arkansas.

The heaviest traffic on I-49 occurs within the cities of Shreveport and Opelousas. The stretch of freeway in Shreveport sees an average of 70,000 vehicles per day, while the stretch of freeway between Lafayette and Carencro sees an average of 55,000 vehicles per day, and the stretch of freeway through Opelousas sees an average of 45,000 vehicles per day between the Judson Walsh Drive and Creswell Lane exits.

During the sugarcane season, many trucks and tractors pulling heavy cane wagons cause traffic congestion and accidents.

===Arkansas===
I-49 in Arkansas is composed of three disconnected segments: northern, southern, and a short connector skirting Fort Smith near Fort Chaffee designated as AR 549.

The southern segment of I-49 enters Arkansas from Louisiana. The short segment progresses northward to a temporary terminus at US 71 and US 59 at the Texas state line north of Texarkana.

The northern segment of I-49 in Arkansas, most of which was formerly signed as part of I-540, begins at I-40 in Alma and runs north to Northwest Arkansas through the Boston Mountains. The freeway passes through steep, sparsely populated terrain before entering the Bobby Hopper Tunnel in Washington County. Entering Northwest Arkansas, I-49 has seven exits for Fayetteville and three exits for Springdale before entering Benton County. The route serves as the boundary between Bentonville and Rogers, with seven exits for the two cities. After an interchange with US 71 just south of the Bentonville–Bella Vista city line, I-49 follows the Bella Vista Bypass, which runs to the south and west of Bella Vista before crossing into Missouri.

I-49 is designated as the Boston Mountains Scenic Loop between Alma and Fayetteville. The I-49 designation replaced the I-540 designation through Northwest Arkansas in March 2014, with the exception of the Bella Vista Bypass, which was constructed between July 2011 and October 2021.

===Missouri===

I-49 enters Missouri from Arkansas on the Bella Vista Bypass, eventually reuniting with US 71 south of Pineville. Continuing northward, I-49 passes through several smaller communities, including Neosho, before reaching Joplin. In Joplin, I-49 junctions with I-44 and begins a short concurrency with I-44 for exits 11 through 18.

Just a few miles east of Joplin, I-49 leaves I-44 and heads north and enters Carthage, intersecting with Interstate 49 Business (I-49 Bus.)/Route 171, which provides an alternate route for northbound I-49 travelers through Joplin. I-49 then passes through Nevada and other communities before reaching the Kansas City metropolitan area. I-49 intersects with I-470 and I-435, which provides connection to I-70, I-35, and I-29.

In south Kansas City, at Bannister Road just north of the Grandview Triangle, the I-49 designation ends, and the freeway continues as Interstate 435 north to I-70 west and the expressway continues as US 71, which proceeds into Downtown Kansas City as Bruce R. Watkins Memorial Drive.

==History==
===Louisiana===
The original plans for the Interstate Highway System did not include a north–south connection between I-10 and I-20 within Louisiana. In 1965, Governor John McKeithen proposed a toll road to perform this function and extend it to New Orleans, but the idea was never carried out. In the mid-1970s, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approved an Interstate Highway to run between US 190 in Opelousas and I-20 in Shreveport, a route that was designated as I-49 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in the summer of 1977. The mileage was gained from mileage released from other highways the states did not build and from a supplemental reserve. In 1981, AASHTO approved a slight extension of the designation along the existing route of US 167 from Opelousas south to I-10 in Lafayette. In its early history, I-49 was commonly referred to as the North–South Expressway.

Construction of I-49 began in 1981 between Opelousas and the small town of Washington.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOTD 1979/80&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This segment joined the portion running concurrent with US 167, an existing limited-access highway, and was completed by 1983. By the following year, virtually all remaining rural portions of the route were under construction, and 95 percent of this mileage was completed and opened to traffic between late 1987 and late 1989. The remaining portions running through the urban centers of Alexandria and Shreveport required a much greater expenditure of time and funding. The entire length of the road was completed on May 1, 1996, with the opening of a section in downtown Alexandria named the Martin Luther King Jr. Highway. The total cost of I-49&#x27;s construction was about $1.38 billion (equivalent to $ in ).

&quot;Interstate 49 North&quot; was a construction project that extended the highway from I-20 in Shreveport to the Arkansas state line and was divided into 11 segments. On November 27, 2013, the first section between LA 1 and US 71 opened to traffic, and the extension to a point just south of the Arkansas state line opened in March 2014. On May 31, 2017, a portion between LA 3194 (Martin Luther King Jr. Drive) and LA 1 in Shreveport was opened to northbound traffic. On June 15, 2018, the entire portion of I-49 between I-220 and LA 1, including an interchange with I-220, was opened to traffic. The remaining interchange ramps opened to traffic on October 17, 2018.

===Arkansas and Missouri===
Arkansas and Missouri pursued an I-49 designation for US 71 and I-540 for many years. In the early 2000s, there were plans by both states to rename the roadway as such between I-44 west of Joplin and I-40 at Fort Smith once a new bypass of US 71 had been completed around Bella Vista, Arkansas, and north to Pineville, Missouri. However, the AASHTO Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbers and Interstate Highways denied the I-49 designation at their annual meeting in September 2007 because none of the new roadway was yet under construction. During this time, there was also some debate as to whether the I-29 designation should be extended farther south from its current terminus in Kansas City to either Joplin or all the way to Fort Smith.

The I-49 designation, consisting of in Missouri, became official at noon on December 12, 2012. The designation applies to current US 71 between I-435 in south Kansas City and Route H at Pineville (McDonald County), which was expanded to Interstate standards beginning in 2010. The last of the expansion projects was completed in December 2012. I-49 also runs concurrently with I-44 between exits 11 and 18 east of Joplin.

The Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) began installing I-49 trailblazer signage (without shields) along with gantry signs and milemarkers, about 1200 signs in all, in February 2012. Signage bearing I-49 shields was covered or turned from view until the I-49 designation received final approval by FHWA. This includes milemarkers at intervals along the entire alignment apart from I-44.

The US 71 expansion involved removing all at-grade intersections and constructing interchanges and overpasses at 15 sites between Harrisonville and Lamar. The two-year project represented a shift in funding priorities for MoDOT, which, in 2007, announced the indefinite postponement of its portion of the Bella Vista bypass project, citing a $139-million (equivalent to $ in ) funding gap in Arkansas between construction costs and toll revenues, and Arkansas&#x27;s commitment to only a two-lane bypass constructed over six years. MoDOT announced the Joplin-to-Kansas City expansion of US 71 in August 2010, to be done with the intention of bringing the I-49 designation to Missouri.

Most of the corridor in Kansas City, constructed between 1990 and 2001, was built to Interstate standards. However, three at-grade intersections—at Gregory Boulevard (71st Street), 59th Street, and 55th Street—prevent the I-49 designation from being extended all the way to downtown. All three of these intersections were on the Kansas City Police Department&#x27;s 2010 list of &quot;Top 20 Crash Sites in Kansas City&quot;, at #9, #6 and #4, respectively, and Watkins Drive has the reputation among commuters as &quot;one of the city&#x27;s most accident-prone stretches of road&quot;. Many neighborhood associations in Kansas City have historically objected to expanding Watkins Drive to a freeway. MoDOT has gone on record stating a court order keeps them from removing the stoplights, making conversion of this stretch unlikely. A MoDOT blog post says &quot;Ample right of way was acquired to someday allow MoDOT to reconstruct the three signal-controlled, at-grade intersections to grade-separated interchanges, allowing traffic on Bruce R. Watkins Drive to flow unimpeded. Neither MoDOT nor the city of Kansas City can initiate this change. It is up to the citizens, who must raise the issue again through the court system to amend the class-action agreement.&quot;

The I-49 designation carries through the Three Trails Crossing (aka the Grandview Triangle) interchange to guide motorists onto US 71 north of I-435 and terminates north of I-435 and south of Bannister Road (Route W) around the 190.0 mile marker. From this point north, US 71 follows Bruce R. Watkins Drive, a parkway which directly connects the I-70/I-670 interchange in downtown Kansas City, and the I-35/I-29/I-70 interchange just to the north, to south Kansas City and I-435, I-470, and I-49.

I-130, a former future designation from 2000 to 2014, was removed and no longer exists as part of the Texarkana Loop.

====Southern Arkansas segment====

A temporary designation of AR 549 had been assigned to I-49 between US 71 north of Texarkana and Doddridge, from the state line.

I-49 has now been completed to the state line. &quot;Future I-49&quot; segments extending northward from Texarkana, Arkansas, plus segments from Doddridge south into Louisiana were shown on the official Arkansas 2013 Highway Map. The route was completed and signed as I-49 in late 2014.

====Bella Vista Bypass====
North of I-40, I-49 previously ended south of Bella Vista prior to October 1, 2021, about south of the Missouri state line. Travelers were forced to travel north on of four-lane US 71 with intersections, traffic signals, lower speed limits, and congestion before the present northern segment of I-49 began at Pineville, Missouri. The completion of the &quot;Bella Vista Bypass&quot; between Bella Vista, Arkansas, and Pineville, Missouri filled the gap and made I-49 a continuous route from Kansas City to Alma, Arkansas.

A major hurdle to the construction of the bypass over the years was funding. The 2010 TIGER grant application submitted by the Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD) estimated the total cost for completion in Arkansas as $291.8 million (equivalent to $ in ). The document states the portion of the bypass in Arkansas is &quot;proposed to be constructed as a toll facility, while the Missouri portion of the Bypass will be constructed as a free route&quot;.

On August 11, 2010, the US Department of Transportation (USDOT) announced $10 million (equivalent to $ in ) in Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant funding to construct a portion of the new four-lane bypass, though the funding covered only a two-lane segment long. Groundbreaking occurred on July 8, 2011, with a public ceremony that included Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe, and Senator Mark Pryor. The USDOT news release refers to the project as part of the &quot;I-49 corridor&quot;, effectively ending questions about how the new highway would be numbered. The following year, the segment between AR 72 north and County Road 34 was let. In March 2014, AHTD anticipated completion of this first segment between AR 72 north and AR 72 south in spring 2014, and the next section in autumn 2014. However, AR 549 between AR 72 and County Road 34 was not completed and opened until August 22, 2015.

Following the passing of a ten-year half-cent sales tax measure in 2012, AHTD had acquired sufficient additional revenue to fund the southbound half of the Bella Vista Bypass without tolls. Since design work had been completed prior to passing the measure, AHTD was able to let the segment between AR 72 and U.S. Route 71 Business (US 71B) in February 2014 as the first job of the Connecting Arkansas Program. AHTD anticipated completion of this project in 2016.

In 2012, Missouri still had $40 million (equivalent to $ in ) available for construction of its portion of the Bella Vista bypass from Pineville to the Arkansas state line. MoDOT&#x27;s I-49 project manager said in an interview that &quot;[MoDOT has] told Arkansas that whatever schedule it sets, we will meet them at the state line.&quot; However, once Arkansas began building toward the state line, it was revealed that Missouri was $25 million (equivalent to $ in ) short of the necessary funds to complete their section. A ballot initiative was defeated in August 2014 in Missouri, which put the project on hold for nearly five years.

The only Arkansas project remaining for a fully operational two-lane bypass was the section between County Road 34 and the Missouri state line; however, was is listed as TBD by AHTD. Design work was complete for the roadway project and was anticipated to be complete in 2015 for the interchange. Construction of the roadway was anticipated to be complete in 2017, assuming a one-year delay related to Missouri funding. Construction on the interchange was tentatively scheduled to be complete in 2018. The final segment from Rocky Dell Hollow Road to the Missouri border was scheduled to be completed with all four lanes by late 2021 to meet up with the Missouri segment. Widening this segment was begun in 2020.

On May 10, 2017, a segment of the bypass between the existing segment near Hiwasse, Arkansas, and a new temporary roundabout interchange with I-49 and US 71 near Bentonville, Arkansas, opened after three years of construction and costed over $50 million (equivalent to $ in ) to complete.

In March 2019, the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission approved funding for the completion of the Bella Vista Bypass. Construction bids were approved in early April 2020, and construction was expected to finish in Arkansas by late 2021. The remaining in Missouri were also slated to be completed by late 2021. Once Missouri completed this portion, the gap closed, and four contiguous lanes of freeway from the Kansas City region to Alma, Arkansas, near the Fort Smith area was completed. The Bella Vista Bypass opened to traffic on October 1, 2021.

==Future==
===Southern Louisiana segment===

The Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) is working to extend I-49 from Lafayette southeast to New Orleans along the route of US 90, which is a divided four-lane highway between the two cities. This segment is listed under High Priority Corridor 37. Some portions, such as the freeway between Morgan City and the Raceland area, are already built to Interstate standards.

In the Lafayette area, the project is divided into two projects, the I-49 Lafayette Connector and the expansion of US 90 from Lafayette Regional Airport to the LA 88 interchange. The I-49 Lafayette Connector underwent a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement study and Conceptual Design Study due to refinements to the alignment originally approved in the February 2003 Record of Decision. It is planned to be a six-lane elevated freeway, mostly utilizing the Evangeline Thruway corridor, except for a segment paralleling the BNSF/Union Pacific railroad line to serve the downtown area. Planning for this segment has been ongoing for decades, but construction has been delayed numerous times due to local opposition. The most recent attempt to begin construction was halted due to federal officials launching a civil rights investigation into the project in early 2023. The rest of the freeway from the airport to LA 88 will be an at-grade six-lane freeway with a segment of eight-lane elevated freeway through the suburb of Broussard. Work on this segment began on November 15, 2022.

US 90 between LA 88 and LA 182 west of Wax Lake is already widened to Interstate standards, including a former at-grade intersection with LA 318 south of Jeanerette, which was converted to a grade-separated interchange with frontage roads for local access. From Wax Lake to the Atchafalaya River bridge at Morgan City, US 90 is a four-lane divided at-grade expressway. A Supplemental EIS is ongoing to expand that segment to interstate standards.

The Raceland–New Orleans segment of the proposed I-49 South was originally approved in 2008 with a Record of Decision for a fully elevated freeway on a mostly new alignment along the entire length. However, in 2014, DOTD launched a study to consider less expensive alternatives and to expedite design and construction of that segment. The resulting design changes greatly reduced costs by incorporating much of the existing US 90 corridor, except bypasses of Des Allemands and Paradis, and a revised connection with I-310/LA 3127.

In the immediate New Orleans area, I-49 is planned to follow the route of US 90 Bus., much of which is an elevated freeway. US 90 Bus. follows the Westbank Expressway through Westwego, Gretna, and Algiers. It then crosses Crescent City Connection over the Mississippi River into Downtown New Orleans and continues onto the Pontchartrain Expressway to an interchange with I-10. &quot;Future I-49&quot; signage is along US 90 and US 90 Bus.

===Shreveport segment===
In addition to the southern extension, Louisiana officials are working on the completion of I-49 from Shreveport to the Arkansas state line. Options for the remaining gap between I-20 and I-220 in Shreveport include the proposed Inner-City Connector, a direct connection between the completed portions of I-49. A no-build proposal is to reroute I-49 onto existing portions of LA 3132 (Inner Loop Expressway) and I-220 through Shreveport. Opposition regarding the direct routing through the historic Allendale neighborhood led to new proposal that would also provide a direct connection to the completed I-49, but loop around the neighborhood instead of going through it. The proposal was made public on January 20, 2023, with strong public opposition and positive feedback.

===Texas===
North of Texarkana, I-49 is eventually planned to have an interchange with US 71 and US 59 and cross into Texas for a short destination, I-49 will enter Texas for about , then turning northwest and cross the Red River to re-enter Arkansas, when completed, I-49 will cross a brand new bridge that will cross the Red River, the construction of any part of the highway in Texas is clearly unknown, with there being no future signages or built portions in the state.

===Central Arkansas segment===
The section between Texarkana and Fort Smith remains largely incomplete. Right-of-way has been acquired and engineering has been completed, but construction is contingent upon allocating funding to the corridor. After applying for and receiving assistance from the 2012 TIGER grant program, ArDOT began construction on the new path for I-49 towards US 71 south of Fort Smith, bypassing Van Buren and Fort Smith. Work is now complete between US 71 and AR 22 near Fort Chaffee as the first and southernmost phase of the extension of I-49 bypassing I-540. The project is explicitly mentioned as an effort to complete I-49 in the TIGER grant application. Colloquially referred to as &quot;Chaffee Crossing&quot;, this first phase was completed on July 15, 2015, at the AR 549 and AR 22 Interchange A groundbreaking on the segment to I-40 occurred on October 13, 2022; this segment was estimated to cost $800 million, almost half of which is going to the bridge over the Arkansas River. Since then, the cost has increased to $1 billion. Construction on this project was to start in early 2024 and last five to six years. However, it has since been delayed to Summer 2025 as the project is not expected to be let until late-2024 or early-2025. Completion will be in 2035. South of this segment, I-49 is planned to follow the general route of US 71 through the state between I-30 and I-40.

<text>Coos County ( ) is one of the 36 counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. As of the 2020 census, the population was 64,929. The county seat is Coquille. The county was formed from the western parts of Umpqua and Jackson counties. It is named after a tribe of Native Americans who live in the region. Coos County comprises the Coos Bay, OR Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Coos Bay is the homeland of two bands of Native people, Miluk and Hanis. Both today are often referred to as &quot;Coos&quot;. Lewis and Clark noted Cook-koo-oose for Coos Bay people. The origin of the name &quot;Coos&quot; is probably influenced both by the Lewis and Clark reference and the name for the region in the Hanis and Miluk languages, kuukwis. Early maps and documents spelled it Kowes, Cowes, Coose, Koos, among others.

Although exploration and trapping in the area occurred as early as 1828, the first European-American settlement was established at Empire City in 1853 by members of the Coos Bay Company; this is now part of the city of Coos Bay.

Coos County was created by the Territorial Legislature from parts of Umpqua, and Jackson counties on December 22, 1853. Curry County, Oregon, was created from the southern part in 1855. The county seat was originally at Empire City. In 1895 the legislature permitted the citizens of the county to choose a new county seat. The 1896 vote resulted in moving the seat to Coquille.

The Territorial Legislature granted permission for the development of wagon roads from Coos Bay to Jacksonville, Oregon, in 1854, and to Roseburg, Oregon, in 1857.

==Politics==
Historically, Coos County was a bastion for the Democratic Party. It was one of the few counties in the West to be won by George McGovern in the 1972 presidential election. No Republican presidential candidate obtained a majority in the county between 1956 and 1996, although Ronald Reagan did obtain pluralities in both 1980 and – very narrowly – in 1984. Since the turn of the century it has become a strongly Republican county in Presidential elections as a result of various factors including de-unionization in the timber industry and opposition to environmental policies often championed by Democrats. The last Democrat to win a majority in Coos County was Michael Dukakis in 1988, although Bill Clinton won pluralities in both his elections. Barack Obama, in both of his presidential campaigns, was the most recent Democrat to even break 40 percent of the vote in Coos County.

In the United States House of Representatives, Coos County in located in Oregon&#x27;s 4th congressional district, which also includes the more left-leaning Eugene metropolitan area and has been represented by Democrat Val Hoyle since 2023. In the Oregon State Senate, the county is split between the 5th District, represented by Republican Dick Anderson, and the 1st District, represented by Republican David Brock Smith. In the Oregon House of Representatives, it is split between the 9th District, represented by Republican, Boomer Wright, and the 1st District, represented by Republican Court Boice. All legislative seats, as of 2021, are held by Republicans in the Oregon Legislative Assembly.











==Economy==

Deposits of gold initially attracted people to the county in the nineteenth century. Between 1890 and 1910, large amounts of coal were mined in the county and shipped to California; production decreased after oil was discovered in that state, and no coal mines in the county have been in production since 1950. These coal fields have been explored for natural gas since 1938, although CDX Gas, a company based in Texas announced in 2003 that they would be drilling two test wells later that year.

A project to build a natural gas pipeline between the cities of Roseburg and Coos Bay, which would attract new industry to the Coos Bay area, was begun in 1999 when voters approved a local bond measure to raise as much as $27 million, with the state of Oregon providing $24 million. The pipeline construction began in June 2003 and was finished in 2004.

Currently, forest products, tourism, fishing and agriculture dominate the Coos County economy. The service industry is replacing the former lumber-driven economy. Bandon Dunes Golf Resort, north of Bandon and south of Coos Bay, attracts tourists and golfers from around the world. Boating, dairy farming, myrtlewood manufacturing, shipbuilding and repair and agriculture specialty products, including cranberries, also play an important role. Untapped rich deposits of iron ore and lead await development.

The Jordan Cove Energy Project is a project that was met with resistance since 2010 by farm owners and other land owners, tribal natives, and some commercial entities who did not want their land being used or taken without their permission, with eminent domain. The project was cancelled in late 2021.

A current project underway in Coos County, undertaken by Oregon Resources Corporation (ORC), uses modern strip-mining techniques to extract chromite, zircon, and garnet from local sands. The tailings after processing will be returned and re-contoured to replicate pre-mining conditions, and the affected area will be reforested. Job numbers are not listed on the company website but an annual payroll of $3.5 million is listed in the economic impact portion of the FAQ. The Oregon League of Women Voters cited similar numbers from ORC, wholly owned by Industrial Mineral Corporation of Australia; the operation was projected to create 70 to 80 jobs with a salary of $46,000 per year. Efforts to block the project because of health and environmental concerns did not succeed.

There are several port districts in the county: Port of Coos Bay founded in 1909, Port of Coquille River founded in 1912, and Port of Bandon founded in 1913. Coos Bay is considered the best natural harbor between San Francisco Bay and the Puget Sound, and the Port of Coos Bay was the largest forest products shipper in the world until late 2005 when raw log exports via transport ship were suspended.

==Natural history==
The tallest documented living specimen of a Douglas-fir tree in the world is found southeast of Coos Bay in the Sitkum area and is slightly more than tall.

<text>Columbia County is one of the 36 counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. As of the 2020 census, the population was 52,589. The county seat is St. Helens.

==History==

The Chinook and Clatskanie Native American peoples inhabited this region for centuries prior to the arrival of Robert Gray, captain of the ship &quot;Columbia Rediviva&quot;, in 1792. The Lewis and Clark Expedition traveled and camped along the Columbia River shore in the area later known as Columbia County in late 1805 and again on their return journey in early 1806.

Columbia County was created in 1854 from the northern half of Washington County. Milton served as the county seat until 1857 when it was moved to St. Helens.

Columbia County has been afflicted by numerous flooding disasters, the most recent in December 2007. Heavy rains caused the Nehalem River to escape its banks and flood the city of Vernonia and rural areas nearby. Columbia County received a presidential disaster declaration for this event.

In the 1910s the Socialist Party of Oregon won a handful of votes. This party was distinct from the better-known SPO which operated throughout the twentieth century.
==Geography==

==Media and news==
Columbia County had newspapers as early as 1891, with the launch of the Clatskanie &quot;Chief&quot;. The Rainier &quot;Review&quot; was launched in 1895. The &quot;St. Helens Chronicle&quot;, which grew out of a series of mergers of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, the &quot;Sentinel&quot;, and the &quot;Mist&quot; founded in 1881. The &quot;Chief&quot; and &quot;Chronicle&quot; merged in December 2023 to form &quot;The Columbia County Chronicle &amp; Chief&quot;, which served as a newspaper of record for the county. The paper published its final edition on September 25, 2024. The &quot;South County Spotlight&quot;, launched in 1961, serves the region along, with a circulation of 3,600. Columbia County has one AM radio station, KOHI AM 1600, which has broadcast continually since 1959. The station is locally owned, with an FCC-estimated weekly listenership of 10,000.

==Emergency Services==
Columbia River Fire &amp; Rescue provides is one of the providers of emergency services in St.Helens. It&#x27;s ambulance turned right in front of a bicyclist and ran him over in 2022. CRF&amp;R&#x27;s ambulance took the victim to the hospital, but billed him $1,862 for the injury they caused. The man filed a lawsuit against the company for nearly a million dollars.
==Government==
The county is governed by an elected board of three commissioners. Each commissioner is elected to a term of four years. Other elected officials include the sheriff, county clerk, district attorney, treasurer, surveyor, assessor and justice of the peace.

==Politics==
Between 1932 and 2012, the county was among the most consistently Democratic in the United States in terms of presidential elections. The last Republican to win a majority in Columbia County had been Herbert Hoover in the 1928 presidential election, although before 1932 no Democrat had won a majority in the county since Samuel J. Tilden in 1876. In the 1952 presidential election, Columbia was the only county in Oregon to not back Dwight Eisenhower. However, Columbia County has begun to shift to more conservative politics in recent elections. In 2016, Donald Trump won the county with just under fifty percent of the vote, a break with the tradition of choosing Democrats for president. Trump would repeat his win in the county 4 years later with an absolute majority of the vote.

While Columbia had an 80-year streak of voting for the Democratic nominee, the margin had been as narrow as three percent in 2004 and in 1984.

Columbia County is part of Oregon&#x27;s 1st congressional district, which is represented by Suzanne Bonamici and has a Cook Partisan Voting Index score of D+18. In the Oregon House of Representatives, nearly all of Columbia County is included within the 31st House District with the northwestern portion in the 32nd District, respectively represented by Republicans Brian G. Stout and Cyrus B. Javadi. In the Oregon State Senate, Columbia County is in the 16th District, represented by Republican Suzanne Weber.

Columbia County is currently one of 11 counties in Oregon in which therapeutic psilocybin is legal.











==Economy==
The primary industries are wood products and paper manufacturing, trade, construction and horticulture. The extensive stands of old-growth timber, which had attracted many of the early settlers to the area, were completely logged over by the 1950s. Second-growth timber provides the raw material for local lumber and paper mills. About half the county&#x27;s workforce commutes out of the county to work, most to the nearby Portland, Oregon, metro area. Columbia County&#x27;s average non-farm employment was 10,740 in 2007. The five largest private employers in Columbia County are Fred Meyer, Cascade Tissue Group, Wal-Mart, OMIC, USIA, and USG.

==Transportation==
===Public transit===
Columbia County Rider (CC Rider), a service of the Columbia County Transit Division, provides six intercity bus lines and one &quot;flex route&quot; serving various points of downtown St. Helens and downtown Scappoose. From 2016 to 2022, CC Rider buses were operated by contract drivers supplied by MTR Western, a charter motor coach operator, but since July 2022 the county has operated the service directly.

The transit service is largely funded by grants from the Oregon Department of Transportation and the federal government. Attempts at making CC Rider a separate transit district and to introduce new taxes to fund it have repeatedly failed since 2015. Columbia County and nearby Clatsop County are currently studying options on consolidating the two county&#x27;s transit services.

Single-ride fares range from $2 to $6 per ride, depending on number of zones traveled. A ride to Astoria costs up to $10 per ride each way.

<text>Clatsop County () is the northernmost county in the U.S. state of Oregon. As of the 2020 census, the population was 41,072. The county seat is Astoria. The county is named for the Clatsop tribe of Native Americans, who lived along the coast of the Pacific Ocean prior to European settlement. Clatsop County comprises the Astoria, OR Micropolitan Statistical Area, or Sunset Empire, and is located in Northwest Oregon.

==History==
The Lewis and Clark Expedition stayed for the winter of 1805–06 in the area, establishing Fort Clatsop as one of the earliest American structures on the west coast of North America. Astoria, Oregon&#x27;s oldest settlement, was established as a fur trading post in 1811 and named after John Jacob Astor.

Clatsop County was created from the northern and western portions of the original Twality District on June 22, 1844. Until the creation of Vancouver District five days later, Clatsop County extended north across the Columbia into present-day Washington. The Provisional and Territorial Legislatures further altered Clatsop County&#x27;s boundaries in 1845 and 1853.

Before 1850 most of Clatsop County&#x27;s government activity occurred in Lexington, a community located where Warrenton is now. However, commercial and social activities came to center on Astoria as that city grew, and an election in 1854 chose Astoria to be the new county seat.

Fort Stevens, located near the peninsula formed by the south shore of the Columbia river and the Pacific Ocean, became the only continental US military installation attacked in World War II, when submarine I-25 of the Imperial Japanese Navy fired 17 rounds at the base on June 21, 1942. The submarine escaped when the order was given not to return fire with the shore guns. While the damage caused was slight (reportedly only a baseball backstop was damaged and a powerline severed), the presence of the enemy ship sowed panic along the Pacific coast of the United States, and other minor attacks occurred elsewhere in the region, including Vancouver Island.

In 1975, Clatsop County commissioners considered seceding from Oregon and becoming a part of Washington. The movement was based on disagreements residents of the county had with Governor Bob Straub. The movement was created after Alumax Corporation canceled their plans to build a plant in the county. Some residents, including two county commissioners, blamed the Oregon Governor for the relocation of the plant. The State of Washington&#x27;s Governor, Daniel J. Evans, said the county was not welcome in the state and Clatsop County commissioners later abandoned the idea.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and , or 24%, is water. The highest point is Saddle Mountain at , part of the Northern Oregon Coast Range.

==Politics==
Like all of the northern Oregon coast, Clatsop County was consistently Republican up to and including the 1928 election, except in 1912 when third-party former President Theodore Roosevelt won by one vote with the lowest percentage for a winning candidate in any county since the Civil War. Since Franklin D. Roosevelt won the county in 1932, Clatsop has generally been carried by the Democratic candidate in presidential elections. The only exception to this is Dwight D. Eisenhower, who won the county twice, thereby making this Oregon county the one to have gone the longest without supporting a Republican nominee. However, George McGovern won it by just nineteen votes in 1972, and Walter Mondale by a mere three votes (or 0.02 percent) in 1984.

In gubernatorial elections, the county has been won by the Democratic Party candidate since 1982, starting with a streak of seven consecutive elections with the Democratic Party carrying Clatsop County. That winning streak ended in 2014, with the GOP gubernatorial candidate, Dennis Richardson, unexpectedly carrying Clatsop with a final vote total of 6,550 votes (46.33 percent) for the Republican and 6,449 votes (45.62 percent) cast for the Democrat and future governor-elect John Kitzhaber.

Clatsop County is located in Oregon&#x27;s 1st congressional district, which has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+18 and is represented by Suzanne Bonamici. In the Oregon State Senate, it is represented by Republican Suzanne Weber. In the Oregon House of Representatives, it is represented by Republican Cyrus Javadi.

<text>Clackamas County ( ) is one of the 36 counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. As of the 2020 census, the population was 421,401, making it Oregon&#x27;s third-most populous county. Its county seat is Oregon City. The county was named after the native people living in the area at the time of the coming of Europeans, the Clackamas people, who are part of the Chinookan peoples.

Clackamas County is part of the Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, OR-WA Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is in the Willamette Valley.

==History==
Originally named Clackamas District, it was one of the four original Oregon districts created by Oregon&#x27;s Provisional Legislature on July 5, 1843, along with Twality (later Washington), Champooick (later Marion), and Yamhill. The four districts were redesignated as counties in 1845. At the time of its creation, Clackamas County covered portions of four present-day U.S. states and a Canadian province. The Columbia River became the northern boundary of the county in 1844. Soon after, John McLoughlin staked a land claim in Oregon City and built a house that in 2003 became a unit of the Fort Vancouver National Historic Site.

Most of the indigenous people of the Wil-lamet Valley were forcibly removed in February 1859, to the reservation of the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde. Most were moved without treaty or compensation for lost lands or resources. Some 22 tribes were moved during the cold winter. It is estimated that 30% did not survive the first year. The tribes eventually prospered, but outside of Clackamas County. They also never received any revenue or compensation from the logging of their homeland forests.

In addition, the Tribes of the Cascades Mountains were isolated to a Reservation after the signing of a treaty in 1859. Confederated Tribes of Warmsprings was established and remains a strong and vital player in actions that concern the Federal forests of the Cascades Range.

Oregon City was also the site of the only federal court west of the Rockies in 1849, when San Francisco, California, was platted. The plat was filed in 1850 in the first plat book of the first office of records on the West Coast and is still in Oregon City.

Around 1900, the spa and resort at Wilthoit Springs was a popular tourist destination. In 1902, the Willamette Meteorite was recovered from a field near present-day West Linn.

==Government and politics==
===Incorporated communities===
Clackamas County is the first county in Oregon to have four models of governance for its communities. Like the rest of Oregon, it has cities (which are formally incorporated) and rural communities (some of which for federal purposes are considered census-designated places).

After the completion of a process that began in late 1999, the county adopted an ordinance on August 11, 2005, which defined hamlets and villages. By the November 30, 2005, deadline, three communities had submitted petitions to be designated as such. Boring petitioned to become a village, but the application was rejected in a town hall referendum in August 2006. The communities along U.S. Route 26 near Mount Hood from Brightwood to Rhododendron petitioned to become &quot;The Villages at Mount Hood&quot;, and it was approved by residents in May 2006. Beavercreek petitioned to become a hamlet, and was recognized as such in September 2006.

<text>Benton County is one of the 36 counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. As of the 2023 census population estimates, the population was 99,355. Its county seat is Corvallis. The county was named after Thomas Hart Benton, a U.S. Senator who advocated American control over the Oregon Country. Benton County is designated as the Corvallis, OR Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Portland–Vancouver–Salem, OR–WA Combined Statistical Area. It is in the Willamette Valley.

==History==
Benton County was created on December 23, 1847, by an act of the Provisional Government of Oregon. The county was named after Democratic Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri, an advocate of the doctrine of Manifest Destiny and the belief that the American government should control the whole of the Oregon Country. At the time of its formation the county included all the country west of the Willamette River, south of Polk County and running all the way to the California border in the south and the Pacific Ocean in the west.

The county was created out of lands originally inhabited by the Klickitat, who rented it from the Kalapuyas for use as hunting grounds. All aboriginal claims to land within Benton County were ceded in the Treaty of Dayton in 1855. Portions of Benton County were taken to form Coos, Curry, Douglas, Jackson, Josephine, Lane and Lincoln Counties, leaving Benton County in its present form.

The city of Marysville, later renamed Corvallis, was made the county seat in 1851. The city briefly was the capital of Oregon. In 1862 Corvallis became the site of the Oregon State Agricultural College, known today as Oregon State University.

==Geography==

==Politics and government==
For a long time, Benton County strongly favored the Republican Party due to its significant Yankee influence. In the 1932 presidential election, it was the only county in the state to vote for Herbert Hoover instead of FDR. Along with Riverside County in California, it was one of only two counties in the Pacific States to be held by Hoover that year. As late as 1960, Benton was the most Republican county in the traditionally Republican state of Oregon, which at that point had never supported a Democrat other than FDR for president, except for 1912 when the Republican Party was divided and a very narrow victory in 1868. Up to 1984, Benton County had voted for a Democratic presidential candidate only four times, in the above-mentioned 1868 election plus the national Democratic landslides of 1912, 1936, and 1964. In 1964, Lyndon Johnson became the first Democrat to win an absolute majority of the county&#x27;s vote since Horatio Seymour.

The Republican edge in the county narrowed from the 1970s onward, culminating when it swung from a five-point victory for Ronald Reagan in 1984 to a nine-point victory for Michael Dukakis in 1988. Since then, Benton County has become a strongly Democratic county, and is usually the second-strongest Democratic bastion in the state, behind only Multnomah County (Portland). This is largely due to the leanings of Oregon State&#x27;s student body and staff, closely tracking with Democratic gains in other counties influenced by college towns. No Republican has come within nine percentage points of carrying Benton County since 1988. Overall, Benton County is a reliable state bellwether, having voted for Oregon&#x27;s statewide winner in every presidential election since 1948, along with Hood River County.

Since 1972, Benton County has been a home rule county, meaning that the citizens have full control over the county charter, rather than using a standard charter issued by the state. The voters have chosen to eliminate the traditional elected county offices of Assessor, Treasurer, Surveyor, Justice of the peace, and Clerk. Currently, they only elect three County Commissioners and a Sheriff.

The three current Benton County Commissioners are Chair Pat Malone, Xanthippe Augerot, and Nancy Wyse. They are all members of the Democratic Party and have served since 2019, 2017, and 2021; respectively. Wyse and Augerot&#x27;s current terms expire in January 2025, while Malone&#x27;s is up in January 2023.

The current Benton County Sheriff is Jef Van Arsdall. He was appointed to the office in March 2021 to fill the remainder of the term of retiring sheriff Scott Jackson.

Benton County is currently one of 11 counties in Oregon in which therapeutic psilocybin is legal.











==Economy==
Along with Oregon State University, agriculture, lumber, wood products, and some printing technology research and development form the economic base of the county. A substantial portion of the nation&#x27;s research in forestry, agriculture, engineering, education and the sciences takes place at OSU.

<doc id="92037" wikidata="Q109665" url="?curid=92037" title="Baker County, Oregon">
<text>Baker County is one of the 36 counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. As of the 2020 census, the population was 16,668. The county seat and largest city is Baker City. The county was organized on September 22, 1862, when a portion of Wasco County was partitioned off. The new county&#x27;s area was reduced in 1864 when Union County was partitioned off, and again in 1887 when Malheur County was partitioned off. The county&#x27;s lines were last adjusted in 1901 when a parcel was added to the county.

Baker County was named for Edward Dickinson Baker, a senator from Oregon who was killed at Ball&#x27;s Bluff, a battle of the Civil War in Virginia in 1861. The county is part of the county definition of Eastern Oregon.

==History==
The first groups from the eastern U.S. following the Oregon Trail passed through the area on their way to the Willamette Valley, unaware of the potential wealth they passed over. At Flagstaff Hill, near Baker City, of wagon ruts left by immigrants can still be seen.

Oregon Territory achieved statehood in 1859. In 1861 gold was discovered in eastern Wasco County, and a gold rush ensued. The area quickly became the Northwest&#x27;s largest producer of gold. In September 1862 the state assembly created Baker County from Wasco. Later, Union County and Malheur County were created from this county. Baker County&#x27;s boundaries were adjusted for the last time in 1901, when the area between the Powder River and the Wallowa Mountains was returned to the county.

Auburn was the original county seat; a booming mining town with 5,000 inhabitants. Once the gold was mined out Auburn&#x27;s population dwindled. In 1868 county voters made Baker City the new county seat. Baker City was incorporated in 1874.

The population of Baker County nearly quadrupled from 1880 to 1910, largely due to the Sumpter Valley Railroad and several of its spur lines. The opening of the railroad helped lumber and mining operations develop.

In 1914 Fern Hobbs, on behalf of her employer Governor Oswald West, declared martial law in the Baker County city of Copperfield. This was the first declaration of martial law in the state since the American Civil War.

From 1915 through 1946, Baker County was represented in the Oregon State Senate by William H. Strayer. When he died in 1946, Strayer had served in the Oregon legislature longer then than any person in the state&#x27;s history.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.6%) is water.

The terrain of Baker County is generally rugged, with 30 percent of the county covered with forest. The county&#x27;s highest point is Red Mountain at around ASL, located from the county&#x27;s northern line. The eastern boundary of the county is described by the northward-flowing Snake River, and the county terrain generally slopes to the Snake River&#x27;s valley.

About 10.10% of families and 14.70% of the population were below the poverty line, including 18.80% of those under age 18 and 12.40% of those age 65 or over.

==Politics==
Like all counties in eastern Oregon, the majority of registered voters who are part of a political party in Baker County are members of the Republican Party. Lyndon Johnson in 1964 was the last Democrat to carry the county in a presidential election. Jimmy Carter in 1976 was the closest any Democrat in a presidential election came to carrying Baker County since, when he lost it by only 34 votes. In the 2008 presidential election, 64.37% of Baker County voters voted for Republican John McCain, while 31.95% voted for Democrat Barack Obama and 3.66% of voters either voted for a Third Party candidate or wrote in a candidate. These numbers have changed slightly from the 2004 presidential election, in which 69.2% voted for George W. Bush, while 29% voted for John Kerry, and 1.8% of voters either voted for a Third Party candidate or wrote in a candidate.













==Economy==
Gold mining was the original impetus for settlement in the area, and at one time the county was the largest gold producer in the Northwest. Gold dredging was conducted with the Sumpter Valley Gold Dredge. With the exhaustion of the gold fields, agriculture, stock raising, logging became the primary economic pursuits. In the last decades of the 20th century, tourism also contributed to the local economy, helped by attractions such as Eagle Cap Wilderness Area, Hells Canyon National Recreation Area, and Anthony Lakes Ski Area. The National Historic Oregon Trail Interpretive Center opened in 1993.

Portions of Season 11 of Discovery&#x27;s TV show Gold Rush was filmed in Baker County.

<doc id="92038" wikidata="Q489447" url="?curid=92038" title="Woodward County, Oklahoma">
<text>Woodward County is a county located in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. As of the 2020 census, the population was 20,470. Its county seat is Woodward.

Woodward County comprises the Woodward, OK micropolitan statistical area.

Woodward County was originally known as &quot;N&quot; County and was composed of present-day Woodward County and portions of Harper, Ellis, and Woods County. Before its division at statehood, Woodward County, then 60 miles square, was the westernmost county of the Cherokee Outlet and adjoined Texas and the Oklahoma Panhandle on the west and Kansas on the north. Political pressure applied by William H. Murray during Oklahoma&#x27;s Constitutional Convention resulted in the reduction of the size of Woodward County to its present boundaries. It is unknown exactly whom the county (and the town) is named after, but the two leading candidates are Brinton W. Woodward, a Santa Fe railway director, or Richard Woodward, a buffalo hunter.

==History==
In the 19th century, the county was part of a well-used military transportation corridor that was important to frontier defense. In 1868, Camp Supply, was established as a depot leading up to a campaign against the Cheyenne. From 1876 through the 1880s massive herds of cattle passed through the southwestern corner of the county along the Great Western Trail from Texas to Kansas.

The Southern Kansas Railway, later acquired by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway built a line southwest from Kiowa, Kansas, through the region and into Texas during 1886–1887. It began the town of Woodward where the railroad crossed the military road. The Wichita Falls and Northwestern Railway, controlled by the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway, constructed a north–south line from Elk City through Sharon, Woodward, and the town of Fort Supply to Forgan, in Beaver County, in 1911–12.

In September 1893, when the Cherokee Outlet opened for non-Indian settlement, Woodward County was created as County N in Oklahoma Territory, though its area was much larger than at present. In a November 6, 1894, election, the county was renamed Woodward County. Statehood in 1907 redrew the boundaries of the county, while the remainder was given to the present Harper, Ellis and Woods counties.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.3%) is water. The Cimarron River forms part of the northern boundary and drains the northwestern section of the county. The North Canadian River flows through the county from the northwest to the southeast. The southern part of the county drains into the Canadian River. Fort Supply Lake, on Wolf Creek, lies in Woodward County.

The county is part of the Osage Plains and lies within the Western Red Prairies physiographic region and Gypsum Hills subregion. There are gypsum hills in the eastern and northwestern parts of the county. Protected areas in the county are Alabaster Caverns State Park and Boiling Springs State Park.

==Politics==










In 2015, surveys identified Woodward County as one of the most climate science doubting counties in the United States.

==Economy==
Agriculture and cattle production have been very important to the county income since before statehood. Grains, especially wheat, were the largest crop. However, broomcorn grew abundantly. Broom factories operated in Woodward and Mooreland. Castor beans, grown during World War I, were processed into castor oil, which was used as a lubricant for aircraft engines.

Extractive industries became relatively more important during the 1920s, while agriculture began to decline. Mineral production included salt, bentonite and petroleum. Natural gas production began in 1956. In 1975, a plant was built near Woodward to extract iodine from oil field brine. It soon supplied 14% of the nation&#x27;s supply of the chemical.

<text>Woods County is a county located in the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. As of the 2020 census, the population was 8,624. Its county seat is Alva. The county is named after Samuel Newitt Wood, a renowned Kansas populist.

==History==
The Burnham site in Woods County is a pre-Clovis site, that is, an archaeological site dating before 11,000 years ago.
The region of Woods County, Oklahoma, was home to the Antelope Creek Phase of Southern Plains Villagers, a precontact culture of Native Americans, who are related to the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes.

An early European explorer of the area now contained within Woods County was George C. Sibley, who traveled through in 1811. He visited a salt formation near the present town of Freedom, Oklahoma, then followed the Mountain Fork of the Arkansas River southeastward to the Great Salt Plains. In 1843, Nathan Boone traveled along the Cimarron River.

The area was part of Cherokee Outlet, guaranteed to the Cherokee Nation under the Treaty of New Echota. It later became important for cattle ranching. The Dodge City and Red Fork Trail, a branch of the Chisholm Trail followed the north bank of the Cimarron River en route to Kansas. The U. S. Government acquired the Cherokee Outlet under Congressional Acts in 1889, 1891 and 1893, and divided the area into counties. One of these was designated M County, prior to opening the area for settlement. The Secretary of the Interior designated Alva as the county seat. M County was renamed Woods County by a ballot measure on November 6, 1894. The name was one of three put forth on the ballot, and was the Populists party&#x27;s submission to honor Samuel Newitt Wood, a Kansas Populist. Despite the name being misspelled on the ballot, the election committee &quot;decided to keep the s for euphony sake&quot;. Woods County became part of Oklahoma Territory.

The Constitutional Convention of 1906 created Major County and Alfalfa County from southern and eastern parts of Woods County and added a part of Woodward County to Woods County.

==History==
In 1883, John Miles leased of Cheyenne and Arapaho land to seven cattlemen. However, arguments soon developed between the cattlemen and the tribesmen. In 1885, the Federal government terminated all of the leases and ordered the cattlemen to remove their stock.

The area was settled in 1886, when John Seger established a colony along Cobb Creek. Seger convinced 120 Cheyenne and Arapaho to settle near the old ranch headquarters at Cobb Creek. The intent was that &quot;Seger&#x27;s Colony&quot; would teach these tribes how to farm, using modern agricultural methods. The name, Seger&#x27;s Colony, would be shortened and become the present day town of Colony, Oklahoma.

After the government declared the excess lands of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Indian Reservation available for non-Indian settlement, the Cheyenne-Arapaho Opening was made available to homesteading on April 19, 1892, in the Land Run of 1892. At that time, the town of Tacola, soon renamed to Cloud Chief, was designated by the Secretary of the Interior as the county seat.

Washita County is located in that part of western Oklahoma which was included in County H of the Territory of Oklahoma, an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from May 2, 1890, until November 16, 1907, when it was joined with the Indian territory and admitted to the Union as the State of Oklahoma. The county itself was renamed for the Washita River. The French had called the river &quot;Faux Ouachita&quot;, literally meaning &quot;false Washita&quot;, to distinguish it from the ‘true’ Ouachita in Arkansas and Louisiana. The spelling of the name of the Oklahoma Washita was changed by substituting &quot;w&quot; for &quot;ou&quot;.

An election in 1900 designated the town of Cordell as the county seat. It was favored by the majority because it was located in the center of the county. The election result was contested in court. The Oklahoma Territorial Supreme Court ruled in 1904 that the seat could not be moved without Federal authorization. The U. S. Congress moved the seat to Cordell in 1906. When the Oklahoma Constitution went into effect at statehood in 1907, it confirmed Cordell (by then relocated and renamed New Cordell) as the county seat.

In 1948, the nation&#x27;s first flood control dam under the authorization of the Flood Control Act of 1944 was completed in the Cloud Creek Watershed in Washita County.

<text>Washington County is a county located in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. As of the 2020 census, the population was 52,455. Its county seat is Bartlesville. Named for President George Washington, it is the smallest county in Oklahoma in total area, adjacent to the largest county in Oklahoma, Osage County. Washington County comprises the Bartlesville, OK micropolitan statistical area, which is also included in the Tulsa-Muskogee-Bartlesville, OK combined statistical area. It is located along the border with Kansas.

==History==
The Osage ceded their land claims in 1825, and the Federal Government allowed the Western Cherokee to settle in this area in 1828. The 1835 Treaty of New Echota confirmed Cherokee ownership of the land. The area now covered by Washington County was part of the Cherokee Saline District between 1840 and 1856 and the Cooweescoowee District from 1856 to 1906.

The first post office was established in 1859 at the confluence of Butler Creek and the Caney River by James L. Butler. Known as Little Verdigris, the settlement also had a trading post and a school. The Civil War caused most of the inhabitants to move away and the post office closed in 1866. In 1867, the Cherokees sold 157,600 acres to the Eastern Delaware.

In 1870, Nelson Carr built a grist mill along the Caney River, which he used to grind seed corn. In 1875, he sold the mill to Jacob Bartles (for whom the town of Bartlesville would be named), who modified the mill to produce wheat flour. Other important agricultural crops included potatoes, sorghum and oats, as well as prairie hay and pecans. Cotton production was attempted in the early 1900s, but the soil proved unsuitable and this crop was soon discontinued.

The first commercial oil well in Oklahoma, designated as Nellie Johnstone Number One, was drilled near Bartlesville in 1897. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, the industry developed slowly because of communal land ownership by the Cherokees, the lack of crude oil markets, and lack of reliable transportation. Bartlesville became an oil boom town only after 1900, when the nearby Osage County oil fields were developed and railroads were built into the area. In 1900, Phoenix Oil Company built a pipeline from Osage County to Bartlesville&#x27;s Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway depot, where there was an oil loading facility. Oil was shipped from there to a refinery in Neodesha, Kansas in the same year. Washington County fields were developed soon afterward. The Bartlesville Field reached peak development during 1904 to 1906; the Bartlesville-Dewey Field in 1905 and the Copan, Canary, Hogshooter, and Wann fields were located in 1907. Several oil companies set up headquarters in the county, most notably Phillips Petroleum in Bartlesville.

Railroads came to this area at the turn of the 20th century. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway opened a line from Owen to Owasso, Oklahoma in 1899. The Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad opened a line from Stevens, Kansas to Dewey, Oklahoma in 1901-2 and another line from Hominy, Oklahoma to Bartlesville in 1903–04.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.1%) is water. It is the second-smallest county in Oklahoma by land area and smallest by total area. It lies in the Eastern Lowlands physiographic region, and is drained by the Caney River. Lakes and reservoirs include Copan Lake, Silver Lake and Bar-Dew Lake.

<text>Wagoner County is a county located in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. As of the 2020 census, the population was 80,981. Its county seat is Wagoner. Wagoner County is included in the Tulsa metropolitan area.

==History==
According to archaeological studies, this area was inhabited by Caddoan Mound Builders during 300 to 1200 AD.

The western area of Wagoner County was settled by the Creek after their forced removal in Alabama in the 1820s. The eastern portion of the county was settled by the Cherokee.

During the Civil War in 1865, the present county was the scene of the Battle of Flat Rock (also known as the Hay Camp Action). Confederate troops led by Brig. General Stand Watie and Brig. General Richard Gano captured 85 Union troops and killed even more who were harvesting hay.

In 1905, the Sequoyah Convention proposed creating two counties from this area. The western half would be named Coweta and the eastern half would have been named Tumechichee. However, failure of the attempt to create the state of Sequoyah negated the proposal. In 1907 at Oklahoma statehood, Wagoner County was organized. The towns of Porter and Coweta vied with Wagoner as the county seat. The county was named after the town of Wagoner, which won the election. The town was named after Henry &quot;Bigfoot&quot; Wagoner, a Katy Railroad dispatcher from Parsons, Kansas.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which (4.9%) are covered by water. It is part of the Ozark Highlands. The Verdigris River divides the east and west parts of the county. The Arkansas River forms part of the western and southern boundaries. Grand River also flows south through the county. It was dammed in 1942 to create Fort Gibson Lake.

<text>Tulsa County is a county located in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. As of the 2020 census, the population was 669,279, making it the second-most populous county in the state, behind only Oklahoma County. Its county seat and largest city is Tulsa, the second-largest city in the state. Founded at statehood, in 1907, it was named after the previously established city of Tulsa. Before statehood, the area was part of both the Creek Nation and the Cooweescoowee District of Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory. Tulsa County is included in the Tulsa metropolitan statistical area. Tulsa County is notable for being the most densely populated county in the state. Tulsa County also ranks as having the highest income.

==History==
The history of Tulsa County greatly overlaps the history of the city of Tulsa. This section addresses events that largely occurred outside the present city limits of Tulsa.

===Lasley Vore Site===
The Lasley Vore Site, along the Arkansas River south of Tulsa, was claimed by University of Tulsa anthropologist George Odell to be the most likely place where Jean-Baptiste Bénard de la Harpe first encountered a group of Wichita people in 1719. Odell&#x27;s statement was based on finding both Wichita and French artifacts there during an architectural dig in 1988.

===Old Fort Arbuckle===
The U. S. Government&#x27;s removal of Native American tribes from the southeastern United States to &quot;Indian Territory&quot; did not take into account how that would impact the lives and attitudes of the nomadic tribes that already used the same land as their hunting grounds. At first, Creek immigrants stayed close to Fort Gibson, near the confluence of the Arkansas and Verdigris rivers. However, the government encouraged newer immigrants to move farther up the Arkansas. The Osage tribe had agreed to leave the land near the Verdigris, but had not moved far and soon threatened the new Creek settlements.

In 1831, a party led by Rev. Isaac McCoy and Lt. James L. Dawson blazed a trail up the north side of the Arkansas from Fort Gibson to its junction with the Cimarron River. In 1832, Dawson was sent again to select sites for military posts. One of his recommended sites was about two and a half miles downstream from the Cimarron River junction. The following year, Brevet Major George Birch and two companies of the 7th Infantry Regiment followed the &quot;Dawson Road&quot; to the aforementioned site. Flattering his former commanding officer, General Matthew Arbuckle, Birch named the site &quot;Fort Arbuckle.&quot;

According to &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, the fort was about west of the present city of Sand Springs, Oklahoma. Author James Gardner visited the site in the early 1930s. His article describing the visit includes an old map showing the fort located on the north bank of the Arkansas River near Sand Creek, just south of the line separating Tulsa County and Osage County. After ground was cleared and a blockhouse built, Fort Arbuckle was abandoned November 11, 1834. The remnants of stockade and some chimneys could still be seen nearly a hundred years later. The site was submerged when Keystone Lake was built.

===Battle of Chusto-Talasah===
Main article Battle of Chusto-Talasah

At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, many Creeks and Seminoles in Indian Territory, led by Opothleyahola, retained their allegiance to the U. S. Government. In November 1861, Confederate Col. Douglas H. Cooper led a Confederate force against the Union supporters with the purpose of either compelling their submission or driving them out of the country. The first clash, known as the Battle of Round Mountain, occurred November 19, 1861. Although the Unionists successfully withstood the attack and mounted a counterattack, the Confederates claimed a strategic victory because the Unionists were forced to withdraw.

The next battle occurred December 9, 1861. Col. Cooper&#x27;s force attacked the Unionists at Chusto-Talasah (Caving Banks) on the Horseshoe Bend of Bird Creek in what is now Tulsa County. The Confederates drove the Unionists across Bird Creek, but could not pursue, because they were short of ammunition. Still, the Confederates could claim victory.

===Coming of the railroads===
The Atlantic and Pacific Railroad had extended its main line in Indian Territory from Vinita to Tulsa in 1883, where it stopped on the east side of the Arkansas River. The company, which later merged into the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway (familiarly known as the Frisco), then built a steel bridge across the river to extend the line to Red Fork. This bridge allowed cattlemen to load their animals onto the railroad west of the Arkansas instead of fording the river, as had been the practice previously. It also provided a safer and more convenient way to bring workers from Tulsa to the oil field after the 1901 discovery of oil in Red Fork.

===Oil Boom===
A wildcat well named Sue Bland No. 1 hit paydirt at 540 feet on June 25, 1901, as a gusher. The well was on the property of Sue A. Bland (née Davis), located near the community of Red Fork. Mrs. Bland was a Creek citizen and wife of Dr. John C. W. Bland, the first practicing physician in Tulsa. The property was Mrs. Bland&#x27;s homestead allotment. Oil produced by the well was shipped in barrels to the nearest refinery in Kansas, where it was sold for $1.00 a barrel.

Other producing wells followed soon after. The next big strike in Tulsa County was the Glenn Pool Oil Reserve in the vicinity of where Glenpool, Oklahoma was later founded..

Ironically, while the city of Tulsa claimed to be &quot;Oil Capital of the World&quot; for much of the 20th century, a city ordinance banned drilling for oil within the city limits.

===Tulsa County Court House===
In 1911–1912, Tulsa County built a court house in Tulsa on the northeast corner of Sixth Street and South Boulder Avenue. Yule marble was used in its construction. The land had previously been the site of a mansion owned by George Perryman and his wife. This was the court house where a mob of white residents gathered on May 31, 1921, threatening to lynch a young black man held in the top-floor jail. It was the beginning of the Tulsa Race Massacre.

An advertisement for bids specified that the building should be fireproof, built of either reinforced concrete or steel and concrete. The size was to be with three floors and a full basement. Cost of the building was not to exceed $200,000. The jail on the top floor was not to exceed $25,000.

The building continued to serve until the present court house building (shown above) opened at 515 South Denver. The old building was then demolished and the land was sold to private investors. The land is now the site of the Bank of America building, completed in 1967.

===1921 race massacre===

In the early 20th century, Tulsa was home to the &quot;Black Wall Street&quot;, one of the most prosperous Black communities in the United States at the time. Located in the Greenwood neighborhood, it was the site of the Tulsa Race Massacre, said to be &quot;the single worst incident of racial violence in American history&quot;, in which mobs of white Tulsans killed black Tulsans, looted and robbed the black community, and burned down homes and businesses. Sixteen hours of massacring on May 31 and June 1, 1921, ended only when National Guardsmen were brought in by the Governor. An official report later claimed that 23 Black and 16 white citizens were killed, but other estimates suggest as many as 300 people died, most of them Black. Over 800 people were admitted to local hospitals with injuries, and an estimated 1000 Black people were left homeless as 35 city blocks, composed of 1,256 residences, were destroyed by fire. Property damage was estimated at . Efforts to obtain reparations for survivors of the violence have been unsuccessful, but the events were re-examined by the city and state in the early 21st century, acknowledging the terrible actions that had taken place.

==Geography and climate==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.9%) is water.

The Arkansas River drains most of the county. Keystone Lake, formed by a dam on the Arkansas River, lies partially in the county. Bird Creek and the Caney River, tributaries of the Verdigris River drain the northern part of the county.

===Politics===
Tulsa County is very conservative for an urban county; it has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1940. The county&#x27;s Republican bent predates Oklahoma&#x27;s swing toward the GOP.

George H. W. Bush in 1992 remains the only Republican since Alf Landon in 1936 to fail to obtain a majority in the county, and even then only because of Ross Perot’s strong third-party candidacy. In 2020, Joe Biden became the first Democrat since Lyndon Johnson in 1964 to win more than 40% of the vote in Tulsa County, and only the second to do so since 1948. It is one of only two counties in the state, alongside Oklahoma County, where Biden outperformed Southerner Jimmy Carter&#x27;s 1976 margin, when he narrowly lost the state.

In 2022, Democratic gubernatorial candidate (and county resident) Joy Hofmeister narrowly carried the county, 49.1-48.9, against incumbent Republican Kevin Stitt. This was the first time Tulsa County had backed a Democratic gubernatorial candidate since 2006, and the first time in its history that it had ever backed a losing Democrat for governor.

The city of Tulsa proper is a swing city. After voting for Donald Trump in 2016 by four points, it swung to a six-point win for Joe Biden in 2020, and also backed Drew Edmondson for Governor in 2018 by 13 points. The suburbs and rural communities, however, remain very strongly Republican.

In February 2020, registered Republicans were reduced from a majority to a plurality in the county&#x27;s voter registration.












==Parks and recreation==
River Parks was established in 1974 as a joint operation of the City of Tulsa and Tulsa County, with funding from both governments as well as private entities. It is not a part of the Tulsa Parks and Recreation Department, but is managed by the River Parks Authority. It is a series of linear parks that run adjacent to the Arkansas River for about from downtown to the Jenks bridge. Since 2007 a significant portion of the River Parks area has been renovated with new trails, landscaping and playground equipment. The River Parks Turkey Mountain Urban Wilderness Area on the west side of the Arkansas River in south Tulsa is a area that contains over of dirt trails available for hiking, trail running, mountain biking and horseback riding. The &quot;Tulsa Townies&quot; organization provide bicycles that may be checked out for use. There are three kiosks in the parks where bicycles may be obtained or returned.

<text>Tillman County is a county located in the southwestern part of Oklahoma, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 6,968. The county seat is Frederick.

==History==
The Medicine Lodge Treaty of 1867 established a reservation in the southwestern part of Indian Territory for the Kiowa, Apache and Comanche tribes. The Jerome Commission started enrolling members of these tribes in 1892, a prerequisite to opening &quot;excess&quot; land for settlement by non-Indians. The first lottery was held on August 6, 1901. It was followed in 1906 by the &quot;Big Pasture&quot; Lottery.

The county was founded at the time of Oklahoma statehood in 1907, and was named for Senator Benjamin Tillman of South Carolina. It had previously been part of Comanche County, Oklahoma Territory. Frederick was designated as the county seat at the time of statehood. In 1910 and 1924 portions of Kiowa County were added to the north side of the county.

The main farm crops are cotton, corn, wheat, oats, sorghum and milo (a variety of commercial sorghum). Many farms have consolidated throughout the 20th century, from 1,724 in 1930 to 587 in 2000; however, the average size increased from to during the same period.

Cattle ranching became prominent during the 1880s, when prominent Texas ranchers (principally Daniel and William Thomas Waggoner and Samuel Burk Burnett) leased grazing land from the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache tribes.

The U.S. military established Frederick Army Air Field in 1941 to train crews to fly Cessna UC-78 Bobcats and North American B-25 Mitchells. After the war, the former base became a civilian airfield and is now known as Frederick Regional Airport.

<text>Texas County is a county located in the panhandle of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. Its county seat is Guymon. As of the 2020 census, the population was 21,384. It is the second largest county in Oklahoma, based on land area, and is named for Texas, the state that adjoins the county to its south.
Texas County comprises the Guymon, OK Micropolitan Statistical Area.
The county economy is largely based on farming and cattle production. It is one of the top-producing counties in the U.S. for wheat, cattle, and hogs. It also lies within the noted Hugoton-Panhandle natural gas field.

Being 50.6% Hispanic, Texas is also Oklahoma&#x27;s only Hispanic-majority county as of 2020.

==History==
Texas County was formed at Oklahoma statehood (November 16, 1907) from the central one-third of &quot;Old Beaver County&quot;. When the formation of the county was authorized by the Constitutional Convention of 1907, the county was so named because it was wholly included within the limits of the Texas Cession of 1850, whereby the ownership of the area was passed from the State of Texas to the United States government. From 1850 to 1890, its lands were never attached to any state or territory, never surveyed, and never divided into townships and sections like the eastern counties were. From 1890 to 1907, it was part of Beaver County.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which are land and (0.4%) is water. It is the second-largest county in Oklahoma by area. The county lies in the High Plains of the Great Plains physiographic region. It is generally flat, but has some rolling hills. It is drained by the North Canadian River, often called the Beaver River in this area. Tributaries of the river are Coldwater, Hackberry, Goff, Teepee, and Pony Creeks.

For tourism purposes, the county&#x27;s location in Northwest Oklahoma puts it in the area designated by the Oklahoma Department of Tourism as Red Carpet Country.

The Optima Lake project, including Optima National Wildlife Refuge, and the Optima Wildlife Management Area being public hunting lands managed by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, is north of Hardesty, Oklahoma.

==Economy==

Cattle raising was the most important economic activity before and after statehood. Farming rose in importance after the 1890s. Despite the occurrence of the Dust Bowl these two sectors have recovered and prospered. By 1990, Texas County led the state in producing grain sorghums, with 4.2 million bushels, or one-quarter of the state&#x27;s harvest, and was the state&#x27;s fourth-largest wheat-producing county, harvesting 10.3 million bushels. By 1997 it was the state&#x27;s top producer of both hogs and cattle. 
Texas County was the fifth-ranked county in the entire nation in 2017 for the number of hogs produced (1,094,877), and pork producer Seaboard Foods is the county&#x27;s primary employer.

Petroleum exploration began in 1922 and resulted in natural gas production from the Hugoton Gas Field. The county remains the nation&#x27;s largest producer of natural gas. Four carbon black plants operated near Optima from the mid-1930s through the 1940s. The field extends from Hugoton, Kansas into the Texas Panhandle.

The 2000 MW Windcatcher wind farm project, consisting of 800 wind turbines from GE and a high voltage AC power line, was proposed for Texas County and adjacent Cimarron County, but ran into opposition and was finally cancelled in July 2018.

==Education==
The Oklahoma Legislature created the Pan-Handle Agricultural Institute in 1909, offering secondary agricultural education for the Panhandle area. In 1921, the legislature changed the name to Panhandle Agricultural and Mechanical College and authorized the school to offer a two-year curriculum. In 1925, the State Board of Agriculture authorized upper division college courses, and in 1926, junior and senior level courses were added. The school name has been changed twice since then, to Oklahoma Panhandle State College of Agriculture and Applied Science (OPSU) in 1967 and to Oklahoma Panhandle State University in 1974. The school is in Goodwell.

<doc id="92047" wikidata="Q6176502" url="?curid=92047" title="Jehovah's Witnesses practices">
<text>Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; practices are based on the biblical interpretations of Charles Taze Russell (1852–1916), founder ( 1881) of the Bible Student movement, and of successive presidents of the Watch Tower Society, Joseph Franklin Rutherford (from 1917 to 1942) and Nathan Homer Knorr (from 1942 to 1977). Since 1976, practices have also been based on decisions made at closed meetings of the group&#x27;s Governing Body. The group disseminates instructions regarding activities and acceptable behavior through &quot;The Watchtower&quot; magazine and through other official publications, and at conventions and congregation meetings.

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses endeavor to remain &quot;separate from the world&quot;, which they regard as a place of moral contamination and under the control of Satan. Witnesses refuse to participate in any political and military activity and are told to limit social contact with non-Witnesses. The denomination requires adherence to a strict moral code, which forbids premarital sex, homosexuality, gender transitioning, adultery, smoking, drunkenness and drug abuse, and blood transfusions. 

Elder committees maintain discipline within congregations, exercising the power to expel members who breach the denomination&#x27;s rules and to demand their shunning by other Witnesses. The threat of shunning also serves to deter members from dissident behavior.

Members are expected to participate regularly in evangelizing work and to attend congregation meetings and conventions that present material based on Watch Tower Society publications.

==Worship==


Meetings for worship and study are held at Kingdom Halls, and are open to the public. Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in which &quot;territory&quot; they reside. They are expected to attend weekly meetings as scheduled by the Watch Tower Society and congregation elders. The meetings are largely devoted to study of the Bible and Witness doctrines. During meetings and in other formal circumstances, Witnesses refer to one another as &quot;Brother&quot; and &quot;Sister&quot;.

Sociologist Andrew Holden claims meetings create an atmosphere of uniformity for Witnesses, intensify their sense of belonging to a religious community, and reinforce the plausibility of the organization&#x27;s belief system. Holden states that they are also important in helping new converts adopt a different way of life. According to &quot;The Watchtower&quot;, one role of the frequency and length of meetings is to protect Witnesses from becoming &quot;involved in the affairs of the world&quot;. Witnesses are told they &quot;should never miss a meeting unless there is a serious reason&quot;.

The form and content of the meetings is established by the denomination&#x27;s New York headquarters, generally involving a consideration of the same subject matter worldwide each week. Two meetings each week are divided into five distinct sections, lasting a total of three and one half hours. Meetings are opened and closed with hymns, which they refer to as Kingdom songs, and brief prayers delivered from the platform. Witnesses are urged to prepare for all meetings by studying Watch Tower Society literature from which the content is drawn and looking up the scriptures cited in the articles.

Kingdom Halls are typically functional in character, and do not contain religious symbols. Each year, Witnesses from several congregations, which form a &quot;circuit&quot;, gather for two one-day assemblies. Several circuits meet once a year for a three-day &quot;regional convention&quot;. Every few years the Governing Body of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses hold &quot;international conventions&quot; in selected cities around the world. These larger gatherings are usually held at rented stadiums or auditoriums. Their most important and solemn event is the celebration of the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Evening Meal&quot;, or &quot;Memorial of Christ&#x27;s Death&quot;.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; conventions and meetings in many areas were held virtually, using videoconferencing software and video presentations.

===Weekend meeting===
The weekend meeting, usually held on Sunday, comprises a 30-minute public talk by a congregation elder or ministerial servant and a one-hour question-and-answer study of a Bible-based article from &quot;The Watchtower&quot; magazine, with questions prepared by the Watch Tower Society and the answers provided in the magazine. Members may use their own words to express the ideas in the printed material, though personal ideas derived from independent study are discouraged.

===Midweek meeting===
The midweek meeting, typically held in the evening, includes a question-and-answer session based on Watch Tower Society publications, Bible reading, sample presentations about how to use Watch Tower Society literature for Bible studies and public preaching, and a &quot;Congregation Bible Study&quot; in the format of a question-and-answer session based on a Watch Tower Society publication.

===Family Worship evening===

In addition to the two weekly scheduled meetings, the Watch Tower Society recommends that Witnesses maintain a weekly &quot;Family Worship evening&quot;—using the time previously allocated for a third weekly meeting—for family and personal study. No specific format for the Family Worship evening is provided, but the Society recommends that members consider Watch Tower Society publications during this time.

===Memorial of Christ&#x27;s death===
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses commemorate Christ&#x27;s death as a ransom or &quot;propitiatory sacrifice&quot; by observing the Lord&#x27;s Evening Meal, or Memorial. They celebrate it once per year, noting that it was instituted on the Passover, an annual festival. They observe it on Nisan 14 according to the ancient Jewish lunisolar calendar. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are taught that this is the only celebration the Bible commands Christians to observe. In the days leading up to the Memorial, Bible reading is assigned from chapters about the days leading up to Jesus&#x27; death.

Of those who attend the Memorial, a small minority worldwide partake of the unleavened bread and wine. This is because Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that the majority of the faithful have an earthly hope. Only those who believe they have a heavenly hope, the &quot;remnant&quot; (those still living) of the 144,000 &quot;anointed&quot;, partake of the bread and wine. In , approximately people attended, and about members partook.

The Memorial, held after sunset, includes a talk on the meaning of the celebration and the circulation among the audience of unadulterated red wine and unleavened bread. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe the bread symbolizes Jesus&#x27; body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine symbolizes his blood which redeems from sin. They do not believe in transubstantiation or consubstantiation. Because many congregations have no members who claim to be anointed, it is common for no one to partake of the bread and wine.

===Assemblies and conventions===

Each year, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses hold two one-day &quot;Circuit Assemblies&quot;, held in each circuit worldwide. Each circuit comprises several congregations in a geographical area. These are held either in Assembly Halls owned by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, or in rented facilities, such as public auditoriums. Once a year, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses gather at larger assemblies called &quot;Regional Conventions&quot; which are usually three days long, Friday to Sunday. These conventions consist primarily of Bible-based talks, dramatizations, and videos, including demonstrations and experiences of their preaching work.

Conventions feature a baptism talk followed by the baptism of new members. Every few years, &quot;International Conventions&quot; are held in selected cities, with visiting delegates from other countries. Attendance at some of these international conventions has exceeded one hundred thousand. The 1958 international convention in New York at Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds had a peak attendance exceeding 253,000.

==Evangelism==
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe they are under obligation to God to &quot;give witness&quot; by participating in organized and spontaneous evangelizing and proselytizing work. Prospective members are told they have a moral obligation to serve as &quot;publishers&quot; by &quot;regular and zealous&quot; participation in the Witnesses&#x27; organised preaching work, disseminating Watch Tower doctrines as evangelists of &quot;the Truth&quot;. Qualifying as an &quot;unbaptized publisher&quot; is a requirement for baptism, and baptism is regarded as an automatic ordination as a minister.

Watch Tower publications describe house-to-house visitations as the primary work of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in obedience to a &quot;divine command&quot; to preach &quot;the Kingdom good news in all the earth and (make) disciples of people of all the nations&quot;. Children usually accompany their parents and participate in the public ministry. In addition to taking part in organized door-to-door preaching, Witnesses are taught that they should seek opportunities to &quot;witness informally&quot; by starting conversations with people they meet during routine activities such as shopping or on public transport, and directing the conversation towards their beliefs.

Witnesses are told that they should put the interests of &quot;God&#x27;s Kingdom&quot; first in their lives and that other secular and recreational pursuits should remain secondary to spiritual matters. Witnesses are frequently instructed through Watch Tower Society publications, and at meetings and conventions, to increase the quality and quantity of their preaching efforts. Watch Tower Society publications suggest that endurance in public preaching is a requirement for Witnesses to attain salvation. 

Members who commit themselves to evangelize for 600 hours per year, an average of 50 hours per month, are called &quot;regular pioneers&quot;. Those who commit themselves to evangelize for 30 hours for one month are called &quot;auxiliary pioneers&quot;, which they may do for consecutive months. Some Witnesses volunteer for missionary service, and may be invited to receive specialized training at the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. These individuals dedicate, on average, more than 120 hours per month to their work. Members who are not able to &#x27;pioneer&#x27; are told they may maintain the &quot;pioneer spirit&quot;, by spending as much time as they can in preaching and by supporting the efforts of pioneers.

Specialized &quot;territory&quot; maps of residential and commercial areas are prepared within the boundaries of each congregation&#x27;s territory and distributed to publishers who are responsible for preaching within that area. Witnesses are instructed to fill out monthly report slips about their preaching activity. For many years, these reports included the number of hours spent preaching, along with the amount of literature placed and the number of Bible studies conducted. As of November 2023, most members are only required to report that they engaged in any preaching activity for the month as well as the number of Bible studies conducted; members who have agreed to a specific hour requirement—for example, &quot;pioneers&quot;—still report the number of hours. The reports are used to help measure the spirituality of individuals. and to establish the eligibility of men as congregation elders and ministerial servants. A Witness who fails to report for a month is termed an &quot;irregular publisher&quot;. One who has not turned in a field service report for six months consecutively is termed an &quot;inactive publisher&quot;.

Witnesses have, in the past, used a wide variety of methods to spread their faith, including information marches, where members wore sandwich boards and handed out leaflets, to sound cars (car-mounted phonographs), and syndicated newspaper columns and radio segments devoted to sermons. Between 1924 and 1957, the organization operated a radio station, WBBR, from New York. Since 2011, the Witnesses have engaged in &quot;public witnessing&quot; in metropolitan districts and fairs using tables, carts, and literature displays. The Watch Tower Society operates a website, JW.org, which provides access to Watch Tower Society literature and video streaming.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses focused on alternative methods of evangelism such as online web applications, telephone, email, SMS texting, and postal mail.

==Watch Tower Society literature==
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses make extensive use of Watch Tower Society literature, including books, magazines, booklets and handbills, to spread their beliefs and to use as textbooks at their religious meetings. The publications are produced in many languages, with a small selection available in 500 languages. Their magazines, &quot;The Watchtower&quot; and &quot;Awake!&quot;, are published in hundreds of languages and in various electronic formats. Issues of both magazines are compiled annually into bound volumes.

New books, brochures, and other items are released at their annual conventions. Various audio cassettes, videocassettes, and DVDs have been produced explaining the group&#x27;s beliefs, practices, organization and history. Since 1942 all Watch Tower literature has been published anonymously. Many Watch Tower Society publications from 1950 onward are available on the &quot;Watchtower Library&quot; DVD and online.

Publications were sold to the public until the early 1990s, from which time they were offered free of charge, with a request for donations. The change in policy was first announced in the United States in February 1990, following the loss of a case before the US Supreme Court by Jimmy Swaggart Ministries on the issue of sales tax exemption for religious groups. The Watch Tower Society had joined the case as an Amicus curiae, or &quot;friend of the court&quot;. The court ruling would have resulted in the Watch Tower Society having to pay millions of dollars in sales tax if sales of their literature had continued.

Witnesses are urged to prepare for congregation meetings by studying the assigned Watch Tower literature, One analysis noted that each year Witnesses are expected to read more than 3,000 pages of the Society&#x27;s publications, according to its suggested program for personal study. Much of the literature is illustrated extensively, with sociologist Andrew Holden observing utopian, post-Armageddon images of happy Witnesses in bright sunshine and pristine environments, often playing with formerly wild animals such as lions and tigers, in contrast to dark-colored images of unfavorable activities such as murders, burglaries and promiscuity that highlight the moral dangers outside the organization.

==Conversion==
Individuals seeking to be baptised as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are required to follow a systematic, catechistical Bible study course, usually in their home, for several months. They will be expected to attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall and must demonstrate a willingness to carry out the doorstep ministry. Before baptism they will have discussions with the elders based on questions provided by the Watch Tower Society to determine that they understand and accept the beliefs of the Witnesses, and that they accept Jesus&#x27; ransom sacrifice and repent of sins and have made a personal dedication to God. 

Baptisms are normally performed in pools at assemblies and conventions. At these baptisms, candidates make &quot;public declaration&quot; of their prior dedication to God. The speaker asks the candidates the following two questions:
# &quot;Have you repented of your sins, dedicated yourself to Jehovah, and accepted his way of salvation through Jesus Christ?&quot;
# &quot;Do you understand that your baptism identifies you as one of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in association with Jehovah&#x27;s organization?&quot;

After candidates agree to both questions, they line up to undergo water immersion, usually in quick succession, often with hundreds baptised at large conventions.

Sociologist James A. Beckford reported two significant distinguishing features of the conversion process when related by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. He said they typically spoke of their conversion experience as a steady progression of mental states in which Witnesses &quot;&#x27;work for&#x27; their conversion by a methodical confrontation with intellectual obstacles, and by a deliberate programme of self-reform. Conversion is not represented as something which to them; it is framed as something that they .&quot; Beckford noted that those he interviewed regarded sudden, emotional upheavals in religious consciousness as suspect: &quot;Experiences which smack of sudden or idiosyncratic illumination/revelation cannot be reconcilable with either the tenor of God&#x27;s historical practice or the nature of his special covenant with the Watchtower Society.&quot;

He also found a striking contrast with other churches in the common attribution of responsibility for conversion to &quot;a spiritual guide[...] the person who acted as the intermediary with the Watchtower movement and who supervised the initial process of learning and reforming&quot;. Beckford cited an interview &quot;representative of many&quot; in which a convert recalled initially resisting the Watch Tower Society&#x27;s teachings until he was &quot;talked into making a serious study of the scriptures[...] I had plenty of objections and was sure the Witnesses were wrong, but (the Witness leading the personal Bible study sessions) showed me how the facts of the Bible could not be faulted&quot;.

==Ministers and ordination==
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses consider as &quot;ministers&quot; all adherents who have been approved to engage in formal evangelizing. Witnesses consider their baptisms to be ordinations; &quot;unbaptized publishers&quot; are considered &quot;regular ministers&quot; whereas &quot;baptized publishers&quot; are considered &quot;ordained ministers&quot;. Witnesses recognize that many government and administrative precedents for ministers are not intended to include all active adherents. For example, only elders assert ecclesiastical privilege and confessional privilege.

Only males may be appointed as elders and ministerial servants (their term for deacons). Only baptized males may officiate at weddings, funerals, and baptisms. A female Witness minister may only lead congregational prayer and teaching in unusual circumstances, and must wear a head covering while doing so. Outside the congregation, a female minister wears a head covering when she leads spiritual teaching in the presence of her husband, according to the Christian complementarian view. Female headcovering is not required for other forms of teaching, or when participating in congregation meetings being led by another. According to the Watch Tower Society, some courts in the United States have recognized that full-time Jehovah&#x27;s Witness appointees, such as &quot;pioneers&quot; and those in the faith&#x27;s religious order, qualify for ministerial exemptions regardless of gender.

==Discipline==

Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. In the event that an accusation of serious sin is made concerning a baptized member, the elders will talk to the accused individual. If it is determined that a serious sin has been committed, a tribunal of usually three elders is formed to determine guilt, administer help and possibly apply sanctions.

Shunning is the most severe form of discipline administered; for many years, the procedure was referred to as &quot;disfellowshipping&quot;; however, the term was discontinued in 2024, and is instead referred to as &quot;removal from the congregation&quot;. Before taking this step, a committee of elders decides whether the individual has committed a &quot;serious sin&quot; and that there is no evidence of true repentance. To judge that repentance is genuine, members of the committee ask questions and review the actions of the accused member. Baptized members who spread teachings contrary to the doctrines of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses can be expelled for apostasy. A 1981 letter to overseers—reproduced in a book by former Governing Body member Raymond Franz—directed that a member who &quot;persists in believing other doctrine&quot;, even without promoting such beliefs, may be subject to disfellowshipping. 

Once the decision of expulsion has been made, a person has seven days to appeal, after which, if the person has not appealed, an announcement is made to the congregation that the individual is &quot;no longer one of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&quot;. Members of the congregation are then expected to shun the individual. Exceptions include necessary commercial dealings or a shunned person living with baptized family members. In these cases, the Witness is not permitted to speak about religious matters, except in the case of parents conducting a Bible study with a minor. The extent to which shunned relatives living in the same household are included in family life is left to the discretion of the family. Relatives of shunned individuals who are not in the same household have minimal contact. As of March 2024, members are permitted to invite shunned individuals to congregation meetings or offer brief greetings at meetings, unless the individual is deemed to be an apostate.

&quot;Reproof&quot; involves sins that could lead to shunning, but for which the individual is deemed repentant. Reproof is given &quot;before all onlookers&quot;, based on their interpretation of 1 Timothy 5:20. If the sin is private in nature, the reproof would involve just the individual(s) involved. If the sin is known generally by the entire congregation or the community, an announcement is made informing the congregation that the person has been reproved. Later, without disclosing names or private details, one of the elders gives a separate talk ensuring that the congregation understands the sin, its dangers, and how to avoid it. 

Reproved individuals have some congregation privileges restricted, until the elders decide that the member has regained &quot;spiritual strength.&quot; Restrictions may include not sharing in meeting parts, not commenting at meeting parts, and not praying for a group. The duration of restrictions depends on the elders. One cannot &quot;pioneer&quot; or &quot;auxiliary pioneer&quot; for at least one year after reproof is given.

&quot;Marking&quot; is practiced if a member&#x27;s course of action is regarded as a violation of Bible principles, reflecting badly on the congregation, but is not considered a serious sin for which the individual may be formally shunned. Congregation members who become aware of another member&#x27;s errant behaviour may &#x27;mark&#x27; the individual, and are advised to limit social contact with that person. &quot;Marked&quot; individuals are not shunned completely, but social contact is minimized.

==Family life==
The family structure is patriarchal. The husband is considered the final authority of family decisions, as the head of his family. Marriages must be monogamous. Wives should be submissive to their husbands and husbands are to have deep respect and love for their wives, and are instructed to listen to them on all matters. 

Husbands are instructed to treat their wives as Jesus treated his followers. He should not hurt or mistreat his family in any way. The father should be hard-working in providing necessities to his family. He must provide for them in a spiritual capacity. This includes religious instruction for the family, and taking the lead in preaching activities. Parental discipline for children should not be in a harsh, cruel way. Children are instructed to obey their parents.

Married couples are encouraged to speak with local elders if they are having problems. Married couples can separate in the case of physical abuse and neglect, or if one partner attempts to hinder the other from being a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness. Remarriage after divorce is permissible only on the grounds of adultery, based on their understanding of Jesus&#x27; words at Matthew 5:32 and Matthew 19:9.

==Morality==
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses demand high standards of morality within their ranks. Their view of sexual behavior reflects conservative Christian views. Abortion is considered murder. Homosexuality, premarital sex, and extramarital sex are considered &quot;serious sins&quot;. Gender transitioning is considered &quot;contrary to nature&quot; and sex reassignment surgery is considered a form of &quot;mutilation&quot;. If a transgender person &quot;who has already undergone a mutilating operation of this sort&quot; wishes to become a member of the denomination, the person is expected to live according to their biological sex, and to leave their spouse if biologically the same sex.

Smoking, including electronic cigarettes, abuse of drugs, and drunkenness are prohibited. Alcohol is permitted in moderation. Modesty in dress and grooming is frequently stressed. Entertainment promoting immoral, &quot;demonic&quot;, or violent themes is considered inappropriate. Members are warned that personal grooming such as long hair or earrings for men, or other styles of dress or grooming might &quot;stumble&quot; the consciences of others. In 2024, the dressing standards were relaxed for congregation-sponsored events; men were allowed to have beards and attend meetings without a suit or tie, and women were allowed to wear slacks.

Gambling by making money through the losses of others is viewed as a &quot;form of greed&quot;, and is prohibited. The trading of stocks, shares and bonds is viewed as acceptable.

==Blood==

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are taught that the Bible prohibits the consumption, storage and transfusion of blood, based on their understanding of scriptures such as Leviticus 17:10, 11: &quot;I will certainly set my face against the one who is eating the blood&quot; and Acts 15:29: &quot;abstain from … blood.&quot; This standpoint is applied even in emergencies. &quot;The Watchtower&quot; introduced this view in 1945, and it has developed since then. Accordingly, the organization has established Hospital Information Services (HIS), which provides education and facilitation of bloodless surgery. This service also maintains Hospital Liaison Committees, which support adherents facing surgery and provide information to the medical community on bloodless surgery techniques and alternatives to blood.

Though accepted by most members, some within the Jehovah&#x27;s Witness community do not endorse the doctrine.

Dutch anthropologist Richard Singelenberg has suggested the Watch Tower Society&#x27;s prohibition on blood transfusions—as well as its edict against fellowship with outsiders—are rooted in the religious desire to maintain a communal state of purity worthy of divine favor. He noted: &quot;Rules of pollution and purity are instrumental in creating structural boundaries around group members. And the more distinctive when formulated into divine precepts, the clearer the dividing lines between the faithful and those excluded.&quot;

==Spiritual warfare==
Watch Tower Society publications teach that Witnesses are engaged in a &quot;spiritual, theocratic warfare&quot; against false teachings and wicked spirit forces they say try to impede them in their preaching work. Based on their interpretation of Ephesians 6:10–20, they believe their &quot;spiritual war&quot; is fought with truth, righteousness, the &quot;good news of peace&quot;, faith, the hope of salvation, God&#x27;s word and prayer. They have advocated the use of &quot;theocratic war strategy&quot; to protect the interests of God&#x27;s cause, which would include hiding the truth from God&#x27;s &quot;enemies&quot; by being evasive or withholding truthful or incriminating information from those not entitled by law to know.

&quot;The Watchtower&quot; told Witnesses: &quot;It is proper to cover over our arrangements for the work that God commands us to do. If the wolfish foes draw wrong conclusions from our maneuvers to outwit them, no harm has been done to them by the harmless sheep, innocent in their motives as doves.&quot;

==Separateness==
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are told they should remain &quot;separate from the world&quot; in harmony with Jesus&#x27; description of his followers at John 17:14–16. Watch Tower publications define the &quot;world&quot; as &quot;the mass of mankind apart from Jehovah’s approved servants&quot; and teach that it is ruled by Satan and a place of danger and moral contamination. Witnesses manifest their world-renouncing beliefs in many ways. They avoid involvement in social controversies, remain politically neutral, and do not seek public office. The Watch Tower Society has stated that voting in political elections is a personal conscience decision, though a Witness who takes any action considered to be a &quot;violation of Christian neutrality&quot; may face religious sanctions. 

They refuse participation in ecumenical and interfaith activities. They abstain from celebrating religious holidays, and reject many customs they claim have pagan origins. They do not work in industries associated with the military, nor serve in the armed services. They refuse national military service, which in some countries may result in their arrest and imprisonment. They do not salute or pledge allegiance to national flags or sing national anthems or other patriotic songs.

Witnesses are urged to minimize their social contact with non-members, even if they possess &quot;decent qualities&quot;, because of perceived dangers of worldly association. Sociologist Andrew Holden indicated they are highly selective in choosing with whom they spend leisure time, generally choosing the company of other Witnesses. Many Witnesses interviewed by Holden reported tensions and ostracism at work because of their religious beliefs. He reported that many Jehovah&#x27;s Witness converts required some social adjustment as they gradually reduced contact with non-Witness friends. 

Association with those outside the organization, commonly termed by Witnesses as &quot;worldly&quot; and &quot;not in the Truth&quot;, is acceptable only when it is viewed as an opportunity to preach. Witnesses are under considerable pressure from the Society to show outsiders they are people of high moral fiber. Holden claims that as a result, Witnesses working with &quot;worldly&quot; colleagues tend to closely adhere to Watch Tower teachings.

Sociologist Ronald Lawson has suggested that it is the group&#x27;s intellectual and organizational isolation—coupled with the intense indoctrination of adherents, rigid internal discipline and considerable persecution—that has contributed to the consistency of its sense of urgency in its apocalyptic message.

==Celebrations==
Weddings, anniversaries, and funerals are observed, though they avoid incorporating certain traditions they see to have pagan origins. &quot;The Watchtower&quot; has stated that the use of wedding rings by Witnesses is acceptable, even though wedding rings may have first been used by pagans, based on its conclusion that there is no definite evidence wedding rings were used &quot;as part of false &quot;religious&quot; practices&quot; (emphasis from original). Witnesses typically observe wedding anniversaries, with the Watch Tower Society noting that wedding anniversaries apparently do not stem from pagan origins.

Other common celebrations and religious or national holidays such as birthdays, Halloween, Easter and Christmas are not celebrated because they believe that these continue to involve &quot;false religious beliefs or activities.&quot; Watch Tower Society publications rule out the celebration of Mother&#x27;s Day because of a claimed link with pagan gods and concerns that giving &quot;special honor and worship&quot; to mothers is a form of &quot;creature worship&quot; that could turn people away from God. The Society also directs Witnesses to shun May Day, New Year&#x27;s Day and Valentine&#x27;s Day celebrations because of their pagan origins.

Their opposition to birthdays is said to be based on how the Bible presents them. Watch Tower Society publications note that the only birthday celebrations explicitly mentioned in the Bible are those of an unnamed Pharaoh and Herod Antipas, and that both were associated with executions, and neither celebrant was a servant of God. Though some churches interpret Job 1:4 to indicate birthday feasts of Job&#x27;s sons, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses interpret them as a circuit of feasts from one house to the next. The Bible does not show Jesus or his apostles celebrating birthdays and &quot;The Watchtower&quot; claims the absence of any record of the date of the birth of Jesus or his apostles indicates that &quot;God does not want us to celebrate any of these birthdays&quot;.

==Construction==
International and regional building teams frequently undertake constructions of Kingdom Halls over the course of one or two weekends, termed &quot;quick-builds&quot;. Larger construction projects, including building regional Assembly Halls and Bethel offices, factories, residences, warehouses, and farm facilities, are also performed almost entirely by volunteer members.

==Humanitarian efforts==
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses provide relief assistance in disaster-stricken areas for their members and others in the vicinity. Medicine and clothing were provided to both Hutu and Tutsi Witnesses during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Following Hurricane Katrina, they helped rebuild houses of Witnesses and others. The Governing Body of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses uses &quot;Regional Building Committees&quot; to oversee relief efforts worldwide.

==Funding of activities==
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses fund their activities, such as publishing, constructing and operating facilities, evangelism, and disaster relief via donations. There is no tithing or collection, but members are reminded to donate to the organization; Witnesses may provide an opportunity for members of the public to make donations as they encounter them in their preaching work. Donation boxes labeled for several purposes are located in Kingdom Halls and other meeting facilities. Generally there are contribution boxes for local operating expenses, a Kingdom Hall fund for helping Witnesses around the world to build Kingdom Halls, and a general fund for the &quot;Worldwide Work&quot;, which includes the printing of literature, organization of conventions, supporting missionaries and disaster relief, and other operating expenses of the organization.

The accounts (including donations) and the financial operation of the local congregation are reviewed monthly and posted on a congregation notice board. Donations are also accepted via mail, and the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society can be named as a beneficiary to an estate, and also accepts donations in the form of life insurance policies, pension plans, bank accounts, certificates of deposit, retirement accounts, stocks and bonds, real estate, annuities and trusts.

<doc id="92048" wikidata="Q495845" url="?curid=92048" title="Sequoyah County, Oklahoma">
<text>Sequoyah County is a county located in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. As of the 2020 census, the population was 39,281. The county seat is Sallisaw. Sequoyah County was created in 1907 when Oklahoma became a state. It was named after Sequoyah, who created the Cherokee syllabary and its written language.

Sequoyah County is part of the Fort Smith, AR-OK metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
Archaeological sites within the borders of the present county date to the Archaic Period (6000 BC to 1 AD). A slightly smaller number of sites date to the Plains Village period (1000 to 1500 AD).

French traders came to this area in the 1700s, as they had posts in neighboring present-day Arkansas, part of their &quot;La Louisiane&quot; colony. Spain claimed the area until 1800, when France under Napoleon re-asserted control. He was making a last effort for French colonization in North America. But he ceded control by selling the Louisiana in 1803, when the United States purchased all French territory west of the Mississippi River.

Until 1816 the powerful Osage Nation dominated this and a much larger territory, reaching to the Mississippi River. With Lovely&#x27;s Purchase, the US bought some of their land. Under pressure in the Southeast, some Cherokee migrated to the west early, and settled here on land granted by the US. The area was then known as Lovely County, Arkansas Territory.

The US forced removal of the Western Cherokee from Arkansas in 1829, resettling them in Indian Territory: present-day Sequoyah County, Oklahoma. Sequoyah was among the Cherokee who moved into this area, where he built a cabin that still stands. The Dwight Mission was moved to a site on Sallisaw Creek, and it still stands.

In the late 1830s, the US forced Indian Removal of most of the Cherokee in the Southeast from the remainder of their lands. They had to trek under Army escort to Indian Territory, a passage they called the Trail of Tears for its high fatalities and sorrows of leaving their homelands.

The Cherokee Nation established its first capital at a place called Tahlonteskee (Tahlontuskey), near the present town of Gore, Oklahoma. Tahlonteskee remained the capital until 1839, when it was superseded by Tahlequah. It continued as a meeting place for the &quot;Old Settlers,&quot; as the Western Cherokee were known.

This area, then known as the Sequoyah District, was dominated by Cherokee who were Confederate sympathizers during the Civil War, as were the majority of the nation. Many of the Cherokee were slaveholders; they also had been told that the Confederates would provide them with a Native American state if victorious in the war. The only combat was on June 15, 1864, when Colonel Stand Watie and his Confederate troops conducted the ambush of the Union steamboat &quot;J. R. Williams&quot; on the Arkansas River.

<text>Seminole County is a county located in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. As of the 2020 census, the population was 23,556. Its county seat is Wewoka. Most of the county was a reservation for the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma which still retains jurisdiction over some land in the county. A small portion of land at the eastern end of the county belonged to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.

Seminole County is notable for the Greater Seminole Field, one of the most important oil fields ever found, which is still producing. It extends into nearby counties. In the early years of the oil boom, workers and adventurers flooded into the county, rapidly tripling the population. As oil production later declined, jobs and residents left.

==History==
Seminole County has been an important part of the Oklahoma and United States petroleum industry for over 80 years. The Greater Seminole Field was one of the most important oil fields ever found and is still producing. Discovered one field after another in 1926, it contained an estimated of oil. To group the fields together, the oil companies decided to come up with a name, and this was suggested by Paul Hedrick, oil editor of the &quot;Tulsa World.&quot; Early oil discoveries in the area were the Wewoka oil field and Cromwell oil field, both discovered in 1923. Then, on July 16, 1926, the Fixico No. 1 well reached the Wilcox sand at 4073 feet, bringing in the Seminole City Field. Located within the Greater Seminole area are 6 of Oklahoma&#x27;s 22 giant oil fields, including Earlsboro, St. Louis, Seminole, Bowlegs, Little River, and Allen. Total production from the Greater Seminole area from 1926 to 1936 was 702,157,800 barrels, or 18% of all production in Oklahoma.

The Maud field, discovered in 1927 by Amerada Petroleum, was the first discovery using reflection seismology. This marked the beginning of the use of modern geophysical methods in the petroleum industry.

The Seminole County Courthouse was built in 1927.

==Geography==

The average household size was 2.54 and the average family size was 3.05.

In the county, the population was spread out, with 26.30% under the age of 18, 9.00% from 18 to 24, 24.40% from 25 to 44, 23.40% from 45 to 64, and 16.70% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females there were 93.20 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.00 males.

==Life expectancy and health==
Of 3,142 counties in the United States in 2014, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ranked Seminole County 3,014 in the average life expectancy at birth of male residents and 3,108 in the life expectancy of female residents, the lowest life expectancy of Oklahoma counties, and among the lowest life expectancy for all counties. Males in Seminole County lived an average of 70.2 years and females lived an average of 75.4 years compared to the national average for life expectancy of 76.7 for males and 81.5 for females.

In the 1980-2014 period, the average life expectancy in Seminole County for females declined by 0.4 years while male longevity increased by 2.7 years compared to the national average for the same period of an increased life expectancy of 4.0 years for women and 6.7 years for men. Seminole County ranked in the worst performing 10 percent of all counties. High rates of smoking and obesity for both sexes and a low level of physical activity for males appear to be contributing factors to the relatively short life expectancy.

In 2020, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation ranked Seminole country as 61st (of 77 counties in Oklahoma) in &quot;health outcomes,&quot; as measured by length and quality of life.

<text>Rogers County is a county located in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. As of the 2020 census, the population was 95,240, making it the sixth-most populous county in Oklahoma. The county seat is Claremore. Rogers County is included in the Tulsa, OK metropolitan statistical area.

Created in 1907 from the western Saline District of the Cherokee Nation, this area was named the &quot;Cooweescoowee&quot; District, and Cooweescoowee County at the time of statehood. However, the residents protested, and the name was changed to Rogers County, after Clem Vann Rogers, a prominent Cherokee rancher, and father of Will Rogers.

==History==

According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, the Arkansas Band of the Osage Nation settled in the Three Forks area (the junction of the Arkansas River, Grand River, and Verdigris River during the 1760s and established two villages called &quot;Pasuga&quot; and &quot;Pasona&quot; in what is now Rogers County. Pasona was near an ancient earthwork platform mound near the Verdigris River. It was later called Claremore Mound, to honor Osage chief Claremore (aka &quot;Gra-mon&quot; in Osage, meaning Arrow Going Home; his name was first recorded by French colonists as &quot;Clermont&quot;.)

In 1828, Cherokee bands who had left the Southeast early exchanged their Arkansas land for an area that included present-day Rogers County. This had been ceded by the Osage in 1825 under a treaty to the United States. The area became organized by the Cherokee Nation as the Saline District of their portion of Indian Territory. In 1907 the western portion of that district was organized as the Cooweescoowee District.

Upon statehood in 1908, the district was designated as a county named Cooweescoowee. Residents supported renaming the county in honor of Clement Vann Rogers, an early Cherokee settler and prominent rancher here.

Shortly after statehood, Eastern University Preparatory School was established on College Hill, just west of Claremore, Oklahoma. The Oklahoma Military Academy, established in 1919, took over the facility. In 1971 the academy was closed and the facility was converted for use by Claremore Junior College. As a four-year curriculum and graduate departments were added, the state legislature renamed the institution as Rogers State College and Rogers University, before settling in 1998 on the current Rogers State University.

<text>Roger Mills County is a county located in the western part of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. As of the 2020 census, the population was 3,442, making it the fourth-least populous county in Oklahoma. Its county seat is Cheyenne. The county was created in 1891.

Roger Mills county is located above the petroleum-rich Panhandle-Hugoton Field, making it one of the leading sources of oil, natural gas and helium. The county also overlies part of the Ogallala Aquifer.

==History==
Roger Mills County takes its name from Roger Q. Mills, an officer in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War and later senator from Texas. The town of Cheyenne in Roger Mills County is the location of the Battle of Washita River (also called Battle of the Washita; Washita Battlefield and the Washita Massacre), where George Armstrong Custer’s 7th U.S. Cavalry attacked Chief Black Kettle’s Cheyenne village on the Washita River on November 26, 1868.

The area covered by Roger Mills County had been part of the Cheyenne Arapaho reservation until after Oklahoma Territory was created and County E was formed. County E was renamed Day County. Day County was abolished and Roger Mills County was created at statehood on November 16, 1907. The county&#x27;s western boundary with Texas was moved eastward when the Supreme Court ruled that the 100th Meridian was farther east than originally supposed.

During the 1970s Roger Mills County and the surrounding area was the site of natural gas and oil development in the Panhandle-Hugoton Gas Field, the largest-volume gas field in the United States, and the world&#x27;s largest known source of helium. Between 1973 and 1993 the field produced over 8-trillion cubic feet (230,000,000 m3) of gas.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water. The Canadian River forms the northern border of the county. The Washita River passes by Cheyenne and Strong City as it crosses the county from west to east. The historically significant Antelope Hills lie in the northeastern part of the county.

In the county, the population was spread out, with 23.80% under the age of 18, 6.70% from 18 to 24, 24.70% from 25 to 44, 26.00% from 45 to 64, and 18.70% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42 years. For every 100 females there were 100.50 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.90 males.

The median income for a household in the county was $30,078, and the median income for a family was $35,921. Males had a median income of $22,224 versus $19,821 for females. The per capita income for the county was $16,821. About 11.50% of families and 16.30% of the population were below the poverty line, including 20.40% of those under age 18 and 10.40% of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==
The county economy has depended on agriculture, which has benefitted from the fact that it lies above the Ogallala Aquifer. Principal crops have included Kaffir corn, broomcorn, wheat, cotton, corn, and alfalfa. Farms have been consolidating throughout the period since the Great Depression. In 1930, there were 2,353 farms, averaging 278.3 acres each. By 2000, there were 680 farms, averaging 1,015.54 acres each.

Petroleum and natural gas production has become an important contributor since discovery of the Panhandle-Hugoton Field.

In 2010, Roger Mills County had a per capita income of 28,427 dollars per resident compared to the United States per capita income of 27,334 dollars. The county had the highest per capita income of any in Oklahoma and was the only Oklahoma county in which the per capita income exceeded the national per capita income.

==Politics==
Roger Mills County is heavily Republican, like most of rural western Oklahoma. It has voted for the Republican candidate in every presidential election since 1980, and in all but three elections since 1952.

<text>Pushmataha County is a county in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. As of the 2020 census, the population was 10,812. Its county seat is Antlers.

The county was created at statehood from part of the former territory of the Choctaw Nation, which had its capital at the town of Tuskahoma. Planned by the Five Civilized Tribes as part of a state of Sequoyah, the new Oklahoma state also named the county for Pushmataha, an important Choctaw chief in the American Southeast. He had tried to ensure that his people would not have to cede their lands, but died in Washington, DC during a diplomatic trip in 1824. The Choctaw suffered Indian Removal to Indian Territory.

===Prehistory and exploration===
During prehistoric times, Pushmataha County was part of the territory during the Middle Woodland period of the Fourche Maline culture. Over time, and possibly through contact with the Middle Mississippian culture to their northeast, the Fourche Maline became the Caddoan Mississippian culture. Their center was at Spiro Mounds, near Spiro, Oklahoma. The elite organized the construction of complex earthwork mounds for burial and ritual ceremonial purposes, arranged around a large plaza that had been carefully graded. This center of political and religious leadership had a trade territory encompassing the full extent of the Kiamichi River and Little River valleys. This 80-acre site is preserved as Oklahoma&#x27;s only Archeological State Park. The larger Mississippian culture traded from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast.

North America&#x27;s history changed after the arrival of Europeans in 1492 under Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean. In the 16th century, European explorers began to enter the North American interior, seeking fame, treasures, and conquests on behalf of their empires.

France&#x27;s Bernard de la Harpe explored the area of the modern Pushmataha County in 1719, in the era when France was establishing settlements on the Gulf Coast. They had founded New Orleans the year before. De la Harpe&#x27;s exploration of the Mississippi River valley was part of an effort to seek trade with the native peoples and also a route to New Mexico. After this time France claimed this region of North America as La Louisiane. It explored Canada to the north from the Atlantic coast along the St. Lawrence River valley, where it founded New France.

The area that became Pushmataha County was bought by the United States from France as part of the large Louisiana Purchase in 1803.

The first American explorer to set foot in the modern county was Major Stephen H. Long in 1817. He was followed in 1819 by Thomas Nuttall, a scientist. Both explored the Kiamichi River valley, which Nuttall described in detail.

The Red River became an international boundary in 1819 when the United States concluded the Adams-Onis Treaty with the Spanish Empire. Fortifying the frontier from Spanish incursion, and securing it against potential uprisings by American Indians, was important to United States policy. The federal government established a chain of forts along its southern border.

Fort Towson, established at the mouth of Gates Creek on the Kiamichi River, just upstream from its confluence with the Red River, was charged with providing security for the region encompassing modern Pushmataha County. As the fort was built in what was considered frontier wilderness, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed a military road connecting Fort Towson with Fort Smith, Arkansas for purposes of supply and provision. Passing through the Little River valley, this military road was Pushmataha County&#x27;s first modern roadway. It lapsed into disuse after Fort Towson was abandoned after the American Civil War. Traces of the road may still be seen.

===The Indian Territory===
Pushmataha County&#x27;s modern origins lie in the Choctaw Nation, during its time as a sovereign nation in the Indian Territory, prior to Oklahoma statehood.

====Political Organization====
The Choctaw territory comprising the modern county was, until statehood in 1907, divided among two of the three administrative districts, or regions, comprising the nation – Pushmataha and Apukshunnubbee. Each of these districts was subdivided into counties. The modern county fell within Cedar County, Nashoba County and Wade County of the Apukshunnubbee District—today the county&#x27;s eastern area – and Jack&#x27;s Fork County and Kiamitia County (Kiamichi County) of the Pushmataha District – today the county&#x27;s western area.

====The American Civil War====
During the American Civil War federal troops withdrew from the Indian Territory and the Choctaw Nation allied itself with the Confederate States of America. The Choctaw government sent a representative to the Confederate Congress, meeting in the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia, and raised battalions of warriors to participate with Confederate troops.

Although no battles were recorded as occurring within the present-day confines of Pushmataha County, the Battle of Perryville occurred just outside modern-day McAlester and the Battle of Middle Boggy Depot took place outside present-day Atoka. Numerous Choctaws left their homes in the present-day county to join the battalions and participated in the Battle of Pea Ridge, in Arkansas, and at the Battle of Honey Springs in the Cherokee Nation, which pitted them against a Unionist faction of Cherokee Indians.

Contemporary accounts make mention of many refugees streaming through the Kiamichi River valley. The war itself finally ended with the surrender of the last Confederate army—Cherokee General Stand Watie&#x27;s forces, who surrendered at Fort Towson in June 1865, over two months after General Robert E. Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia—and with it any chance of Confederate success.

Sometime before 1862 a Negro slave, Wallace Willis, composed the Negro spiritual &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot;. He was then working at Spencer Academy, a Choctaw Nation boarding school located at Spencervile, Indian Territory. The site of the academy and old Spencerville was located less than 1,000 yards from the current southern border of Pushmataha County. Known as Uncle Wallace, Willis may have resided in Pushmataha County. He died in present-day Atoka County and is buried in an unmarked grave.

====Railroads arrive====
The Choctaw people were sedentary. Their lives were tied to their farms and small acreages. The Choctaw Nation was not home to industry of any sort. As a result, the territory comprising modern-day Pushmataha County was still virgin wilderness decades after the Choctaws’ arrival.

During the 1880s the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad – popularly known as the Frisco—built a line from Fort Smith, Arkansas to Paris, Texas. The federal government granted the railroad rights-of-way in Indian Territory to stimulate development and attract European-American settlers. Station stops were established every few miles, both to aid in developing towns and also to serve the railroad.

The Frisco&#x27;s route traveled along the Kiamichi River valley, entering the present-day county near Albion and leaving the river only at Antlers, to skirt the massive bluff where it is located. 

The railroad stimulated development of businesses and other ties to mainstream United States society. The telegraph was developed and constructed along with the railroad, providing rapid news of events outside the Choctaw Nation.

Logging companies opened operations immediately. Rough-and-tumble sawmill communities began growing up around the railroad station stops. Kosoma, a veritable boomtown, boasted several hotels, doctors’ offices, and general stores during its heyday.

During the next few decades, loggers harvested the entire region, using the railroad stations as transshipment points. These transshipment points developed into the present-day communities of Albion, Moyers, and Antlers. Other communities along the railroad between these points later vanished or are today only place names, such as Kellond, Stanley and Kiamichi.

For decades the Frisco constituted the greatest feat of engineering and manmade structure in Pushmataha County. Workers moved and shaped huge amounts of earth to form its elevated roadbed, and constructed numerous wooden trestles over creeks and rivers. Once in place the railroad attracted commerce and industry, where white men in the Indian Territory hoped to stake a claim.

====Bid for self-determination====
Although the Five Civilized Tribes of the Indian Territory opposed being incorporated within a United States state, by the turn of the 20th century, statehood of some sort appeared inevitable. A group of leaders from the Five Civilized Nations – Choctaw, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Creek, and Seminole – met at Muskogee in an attempt to seize the initiative and fashion a state from the Indian Territory, a jurisdiction to be controlled by Native Americans. Their meeting, which came to be known as the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention, established the proposed State of Sequoyah.

The leaders meeting in Muskogee recognized that the counties of the Choctaw Nation, drawn to reflect easily recognizable natural landmarks such as mountain ranges and rivers, were not economically viable. Jack&#x27;s Fork County, as example – in which Antlers was located – was a vast territory whose tiny county seat was Many Springs (modern-day Daisy, Oklahoma). But the only commercially successful town within its boundaries was Antlers, and it was situated in its far southeastern corner.

County boundaries for the new State of Sequoyah were crafted to take into account the existing towns and the range of their commercial interests. County seats were centered geographically within the populations of the areas they would govern.

The area comprising modern-day Pushmataha County proved a particular challenge. Huge areas of its eastern portion had few people. Its population was centered in towns along the railroad in the Kiamichi River valley. A county was eventually drawn with the crescent of the Kiamichi River valley forming its commercial heart, and it was to be called Pushmataha County, Sequoyah.

Records of the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention&#x27;s committee on counties are lost, and no evidence remains to document the committee&#x27;s deliberations. They wanted an area named after their Chief Pushmataha, and singled out the future Pushmataha County, Sequoyah for this honor.

Hugo&#x27;s businesses served an area extending as far north as Kent, Speer, Hamden, and nearly to Rattan. As a result, the county boundary for the proposed Hitchcock County – with Hugo as county seat – was established along the line of the existing boundary between Choctaw and Pushmataha counties. Similar considerations governed the establishment of the county&#x27;s northern, eastern and western borders.

The United States Congress failed to admit the proposed State of Sequoyah into the Union, preferring to await a possible federation of the Indian Territory and Territory of Oklahoma. This was soon proposed. In 1907 the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention met in Guthrie, Oklahoma Territory to create the new State of Oklahoma. During these deliberations it became clear that the work of the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention had been groundbreaking: the Guthrie meeting essentially adopted nearly the same boundaries for Pushmataha County, Oklahoma as were proposed earlier for it in the state of Sequoyah, again identifying Antlers as county seat.

===Since statehood===

Pushmataha County at statehood was considered an agricultural paradise. Local residents believed the soil to be fertile and the weather enviable and moderate; it seemed that almost any fruit or vegetable could be grown. Most residents at the time were farmers who lived off their land.

Cotton was king for the county&#x27;s first few decades. It was grown throughout the Kiamichi River valley. Growers hauled it into Antlers, Clayton, Albion, and other railroad towns to be weighed and shipped to distant markets on the Frisco Railroad.

Many of the farmers or hired hands were African Americans, descendants of slaves of the Choctaw. After being emancipated following the American Civil War under an 1866 treaties that the United States made with each of the Five Civilized Tribes, African Americans who stayed with the Choctaw were called Choctaw Freedmen. They were granted membership in the nation with voting rights. Others came to the area as laborers in the late 19th century. The county had a significant African-American population in the early 20th century, although this has since dwindled to almost nothing, as people left to seek work. Many African Americans worked in cotton cultivation and, after cotton&#x27;s decline, they moved elsewhere for other work.

The territory comprising Pushmataha County had been part of the Choctaw Nation, Indian Territory. It was almost completely unimproved in the European-American sense. The Choctaw government owned land in &quot;severalty&quot;, or common, controlling the communal land. The Choctaw had their own culture and did not need bridges, roads, or public works.

Early business leaders at statehood immediately sought to fund public improvements by asking local voters to pass bonds. The state government did not invest in such infrastructure. Businessmen tried to pass bridge bonds, as example, to build bridges across the Kiamichi River and Jack Fork Creek. These uniformly failed to gain approval, slowing the county&#x27;s business development. Choctaw County, by contrast, passed bonds almost immediately, causing bridges to be built throughout the county. This proved excellent for business and commerce, and after this point Hugo grew significantly faster than Antlers.

Pushmataha County began to develop as European Americans settled and founded communities throughout the county. Each community built its own school, and raised money with which to hire a teacher or teachers. Residents also founded churches, mostly of various Protestant denominations with which they were affiliated. Residents of some of the more significant towns, such as Jumbo, Moyers, Clayton and Albion, also established cultural leagues or institutions—poetry clubs, music groups, and literary societies – in a bid for cultural refinement.
The Choctaw continued playing a role in the region; its members were elected to local government and served as other government and society leaders in Pushmataha County.

During World War I, county resident Tobias W. Frazier (Choctaw) was a soldier in the U.S. Army and a member of the famous Choctaw Code Talkers. Other Code Talkers were from just over the border in McCurtain County. The fourteen soldiers were part of a pioneering use of American Indian languages as military code during war, to enable secret communications among the Allies. Their contributions helped gain victory and brought World War I to a quicker close.

Federal government programs developed by the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression of the 1930s brought substantial improvements and infrastructure to the county: the federal Works Progress Administration (or WPA) directed the construction with local workers of handsome, sturdy schools and school gymnasiums in numerous communities. The new buildings were built of native &quot;red rock&quot; gathered in nearby fields. They aged very well. Several are still in use, notably in Moyers, Rattan and Antlers. But the school at Jumbo was bulldozed by a local farmer in the 1990s to clear the field for cattle.

The Rural Electrification Administration provided guidance and funding to bring electricity to the rural county; electrical lines were strung, connecting homes to the electrical grid. These changes improved indoor conditions, and people began to acquire air conditioning and television from the 1950s on. People more often conducted their social lives inside rather than on town streets. Architectural design changed, as stores, churches and homes no longer had to allow for maximum ventilation via the free flow of air from open windows and doors.

Highways were paved and standardized in the 1950s, making travel easier and linking farms and countryside to the town markets, and the towns to one another. As people bought more automobiles, they stopped using the railroad. The Frisco ceased passenger operations in the late 1950s as unprofitable. Wholesale changes resulted from railroad restructuring in the later 20th century, and the Frisco ended freight operations in the early 1980s. At that time the trestle bridges were dismantled, rails removed and the roadbed was abandoned to nature.

The Indian Nation Turnpike, which opened in 1970, had only one interchange in all of Pushmataha County, at Antlers, connecting residents to freeway travel to Oklahoma City and Tulsa.

==Geography==
Pushmataha County&#x27;s location in southeastern Oklahoma places it in a 10-county area designated for tourism purposes by the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation as Choctaw Country, previously Kiamichi Country. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.9%) is water.

Most of Pushmataha County is mountainous, with the exception of a relatively flat agricultural belt along the county&#x27;s southern border. The Kiamichi River valley forms a crescent through the county from northeast to southwest. As was typical in prehistoric times, most human habitation has continued to be along this crescent.

The Kiamichi Mountains, a sub-range of the Ouachita Mountains, occupy most of the land in the county. This mountain chain has never been formally defined, nor have its neighboring mountain chains, such as the Winding Stair Mountains to the county&#x27;s north or the Bok Tuklo Mountains to its east. The Kiamichi Mountains range to a height of approximately in the county. Many of its summits are in the shape of long furrows. The mountains are difficult to penetrate with road construction and large areas of the county are virtually empty of population.

Two rivers, the Kiamichi and Little River, flow through the county with their numerous tributaries. Sardis Lake, a flood-control facility in the northeastern part of the county, impounds the waters of Jack Fork Creek. Hugo Lake, in Choctaw County, provides a similar function on the main stem of the river. It backs up the Kiamichi River northward into the county. Smaller impoundments include Clayton Lake, Nanih Waiya Lake, Ozzie Cobb Lake and Pine Creek Lake.

Major tributaries of the Kiamichi River include Jack Fork Creek, Buck Creek, and Ten Mile Creek. Black Fork Creek and Pine Creek are the most significant tributaries of Little River.

A very small portion of the southwest corner of Pushmataha County features Lamey Slash, an area of wetlands which drains into Muddy Boggy Creek. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the word &quot;slash&quot; is a noun which refers to a swamp. This is the only portion of the county not falling within the Kiamichi or Little River watersheds.

Interesting geographical features in the county include Rock Town, a small region of distinctive boulders in Johns Valley; Umbrella Rock near Clayton; McKinley Rocks near Tuskahoma; and the Potato Hills—unusually serrated landforms near Tuskahoma.

==Wildlife management areas==
Three areas designated for wildlife management by the State of Oklahoma may be found in the county: The Pine Creek Wildlife Management Area, in the southeastern part of the county adjacent to Pine Creek Lake, the Pushmataha Wildlife Management Area, near Clayton, and part of the Honobia Creek Wildlife Management Area managed by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation. A multi-year research project regarding species management is underway in the Pushmataha Wildlife Management Area.

==Climate==
Pushmataha County, located at the heart of &quot;Tornado Alley&quot;, has a sometimes turbulent and often capricious climate.

High temperatures range during summer as high as 100 °F., often for several or more days in a row. Low temperatures during the winter can range as far as the single digits, but these &quot;cold snaps&quot; are rare and short-lived.

Rainfall varies across the county. Its easternmost area, in the vicinity of Honobia and north of Cloudy, receives approximately 52 inches of rain per year. Its western portions receive approximately 46 inches per year.

Snow is a rare event, and is almost never deeper than one inch. What snow falls generally melts within a day. Ice is a more frequent occurrence, sometimes breaking tree branches and downing power lines.

Tornado season ranges from approximately April to September each year. Pushmataha County experiences powerful storms each year. A tornado striking Antlers in April 1945 devastated the town and killed 69 residents. Meteorologists now believe it to have been the most powerful category of tornado possible, and the 32nd most devastating tornado in U.S. history. Modern-day residents are protected by a civil defense system consisting of &quot;storm spotters&quot; stationed throughout the populated areas during threatening weather, observing the skies for signs of rotations or funnels. In Antlers a system of three public-alert sirens sounds the alarm when a funnel is spotted, allowing residents to seek shelter.

During recent decades the county has experienced unstable weather patterns. It is currently in the midst of a multi-year drought, at least as measured by local standards. Rainfall has been much below average during this time.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2010, there were 11,572 people, 4,809 households, and 3,247 families residing in the county. The population density was . There were 6,110 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the county was 75% White, 0.7% Black or African American, 17.6% Native American, 0.2% Asian, less than 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.8% from other races, and 5.7% from two or more races. Nearly 3% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 96.2% spoke English, 1.7% Spanish and 1.6% Choctaw as their first language.

There were 4,809 households, of which half (50.9%) were married couples living together and a third (32.5%) were non-families, while the remainder were either a female or male householder with no spouse present. A third of households (29.2%) included children under the age of 18. Individuals living alone accounted for a third of households (28.4%) and solitary accounted for 14% of households. The average household size was 2.92 and the average family size was 3.52.

In the county, the population was spread out, with 22.4% under the age of 18, 7.5% from 18 to 24, 21% from 25 to 44, 28.9% from 45 to 64, and 20.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 44.3 years. For every 100 females there were 97.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 95.3 males.

The median income for a household in the county was $29,053, and the median income for a family was $36,887. Males had a median income of $25,509 versus $17,473 for females. The per capita income for the county was $16,583. Eighteen percent of families and 27.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including half (45.3%) of those under age 18 and 13.6% of those age 65 or over.

==Politics==












==Economy==
Pushmataha County has always been separated economically from the rest of Oklahoma by what the economists call the &quot;Ouachita barrier&quot;. The Kiamichi Mountains and the mountains to the north of them, all subranges of the Ouachita Mountains, cause commerce with points to their north to be difficult. McAlester, Oklahoma, instead of being a regional trading center for Pushmataha County, instead seems very remote from it.

Natural resources have always been the lifeblood of Pushmataha County.

The county is one of the few in Oklahoma in which the petroleum industry does not, and has never had, a major presence drilling for oil. During recent years extraction companies have drilled successfully for natural gas, and this is increasingly common.

During the later days of the Indian Territory and early statehood asphalt was mined at two locations: Jumbo and Sardis. For a time these were economically successful, even at Jumbo, which experienced a catastrophic mine explosion in 1910 which killed numerous miners.

Timber is an economic mainstay. Lumber companies own large swaths of the county and operate vast tree plantations. Fast-growing pine trees are the timber of choice, and in many areas of the county a virtual monoculture of pine trees—at the expense of any other—has been established.

During the Twentieth Century a rapidly improving transportation network enabled Pushmataha County to advance economically. At this writing one federal highway and several state highways are in operation. In addition, the Indian Nation Turnpike, a four-lane turnpike constructed to national interstate highway standards, is in operation with interchanges at Antlers and Daisy.

==NRHP sites==
The following sites in Pushmataha County are listed on the National Register of Historic Places:
* Albion State Bank, Albion
* Antlers Frisco Depot and Antlers Spring, Antlers
* Choctaw Capitol Building, Tuskahoma
* Clayton High School Auditorium, Clayton
* Fewell School, Nashoba
* James Martin Baggs Log Barn, Pickens
* Mato Kosyk House, Albion
* Snow School, Snow

In 1984 a growing awareness of the county&#x27;s rich history—encompassed by these and other historic sites—and the fact its legacy was becoming endangered—prompted a group of Antlers residents to found the Pushmataha County Historical Society. The society&#x27;s first project was a successful initiative to obtain and preserve the Antlers Frisco Depot. It later completed a large-scale inventory of county cemeteries, and has undertaken numerous other projects since.

A significant historical site is also located atop Big Mountain, north of Moyers and east of Kosoma. During World War II two aircraft flown by British pilots from a Royal Air Force base in Texas crashed in poor weather into White Rock Mountain and Big Mountain, killing four crewmen. In 2000 the AT6 Monument was dedicated in their memory at the crash site on Big Mountain, to international acclaim.

<text>Pottawatomie County is a county located in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. As of the 2020 census, the population was 72,454. Its county seat is Shawnee.

Pottawatomie County is part of the Shawnee, OK micropolitan statistical area, which is Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma Government in the Oklahoma City–Shawnee, OK combined statistical area.

==History==
Pottawatomie County was carved out of land originally given to the Creek and Seminole after their forced removal from Georgia and Florida. After the Civil War, the Creek and Seminole were forced to cede their lands back to the federal government, and the area of Pottawatomie County was used to resettle the Iowa, Sac and Fox, Absentee Shawnee, Potawatomi and Kickapoo tribes.

Non-Indian settlement began on September 22, 1891, when all the tribes except the Kickapoo agreed to land allotment, where communal reservation land was divided and allotted to individual members of the tribes. The remaining land was opened to settlement.

During the land run, Pottawatomie County was organized as County &quot;B&quot; with Tecumseh as the county seat. In 1892, the voters of the county elected to rename County &quot;B&quot; as Pottawatomie County after the Potawatomi Indians.

In 1895, the Kickapoo gave up their land rights and their land was given away to white settlers in the last land run in Oklahoma.

In 1930, Shawnee, now bigger in size than Tecumseh, was approved by the voters to become the new county seat. The Pottawatomie County Court House was built in 1934 by the Public Works Administration. The court house project cost $250,000 to complete.

On May 19, 2013, during an outbreak of tornadoes, a mobile home park was nearly destroyed, killing a 79-year-old man and injuring at least six others as well as damaging at least 35 structures. Frame and brick homes west of Shawnee were also affected.

<text>Pontotoc County is a county in the south central part of Oklahoma. As of the 2020 census, the population was 38,065. Its county seat is Ada. The county was created at statehood from part of the Chickasaw Nation in Indian Territory. It was named for a historic Chickasaw tribal area in Mississippi. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, Pontotoc is usually translated &quot;cattail prairie&quot; or &quot;land of hanging grapes.&quot;

==History==
The present Pontotoc County was part of the land that the U.S. government granted in 1830 to the Choctaw tribe via the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. In 1837, the Chickasaw tribe was granted land within the Choctaw domain. In 1857, the Chickasaw Nation formed its own government on this land. However, few Chickasaw settled there until after the Civil War, mainly because of attacks by various Plains Indian tribes.

The first settlers were located in the vicinity of Boggy Depot during the 1840s. Camp Arbuckle was established to protect migrants traveling on the California Road. After the Civil War, settlements began spreading through the area. Some of the new settlers were illegal white intruders and outlaws. The first post office was established at Stonewall in 1878. The town of Ada was founded in 1890. After three railroads built lines through Ada, it became the dominant community of the area. Ada was named county seat when Pontotoc County was created.
