<text>Ralph Bakshi (born October 29, 1938) is an American retired animator and filmmaker, known for his fantastical animated films. In the 1970s, he established an alternative to mainstream animation through independent and adult-oriented productions. Between 1972 and 1994, he directed nine theatrically released feature films, predominantly urban dramas and fantasy films, five of which he wrote. He has also been involved in numerous television projects as director, writer, producer and animator.

Beginning his career at the Terrytoons television cartoon studio as a cel polisher, Bakshi was eventually promoted to animator and then director. He moved to the animation division of Paramount Pictures in 1967 and started his own studio, Bakshi Productions, in 1968. Through producer Steve Krantz, Bakshi made his debut feature film, &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;, released in 1972. It was based on the comic strip by Robert Crumb, was the first animated film to receive an X rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, and remains the most successful independent animated feature of all time.

Over the next 11 years, Bakshi directed seven additional animated features. He is well known for such films as &quot;Wizards&quot; (1977), &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1978), &quot;American Pop&quot; (1981), and &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; (1983). In 1987, Bakshi returned to television work, producing the series &quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot;, which ran for two years. After a nine-year hiatus from feature films, he directed &quot;Cool World&quot; (1992), which was largely rewritten during production and received poor reviews, consequently being his last theatrical feature-length film to date. Bakshi returned to television with the live-action film &quot;Cool and the Crazy&quot; (1994) and the anthology series &quot;Spicy City&quot; (1997).

During the 2000s, he focused largely on fine art and painting, and in 2003, co-founded the Bakshi School of Animation with his son Eddie and Jess Gorell. Bakshi has received several awards for his work, including the 1980 Golden Gryphon for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; at the Giffoni Film Festival, the 1988 Annie Award for Distinguished Contribution to the Art of Animation, and the 2003 Maverick Tribute Award at the Cinequest Film Festival.

==Early life==
Ralph Bakshi was born on October 29, 1938 in Haifa, British Mandate of Palestine, to a Krymchak Jewish family. In 1939, his family migrated to the United States, and he grew up in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn. The family lived in a low-rent apartment, where Bakshi became fascinated with the urban milieu. As a child, he enjoyed comic books, and he often dug through trash cans to find them.

According to an interview in 2009, Bakshi said he was very poor and the walls of his neighborhood were constantly repainted. He liked the feeling when he looked out the window and saw the sun as a little boy, and whenever he would walk out in the streets, someone would break open the wooden crates in the push-carts that were filled with food, stating as such: &quot;And the push carts were wood, and most of the buildings were made out of old wood, going back to the turn of the century, and they were repainted a lot but the paint was faded by, you know the hundred years of snow and rain, repainted and faded again.&quot; Bakshi loved the faded colors, the nails, the wooden crates, and he would build his own toys from the wood. He recalled having &quot;a great feeling with wood, cement, and nails&quot;.

In the spring of 1947, Bakshi&#x27;s father and uncle traveled to Washington, D.C., in search of business opportunities, and soon moved the family to the black neighborhood of Foggy Bottom. Bakshi recalled, &quot;All my friends were black, everyone we did business with was black, the school across the street was black. It was segregated, so everything was black. I went to see black movies; black girls sat on my lap. I went to black parties. I was another black kid on the block. No problem!&quot;

The racial segregation of local schools meant that the nearest white school was several miles away; Bakshi obtained his mother&#x27;s permission to attend the nearby black school with his friends. Most of the students had no problem with Bakshi&#x27;s presence, but a teacher sought advice from the principal, who called the police. Fearing that segregated whites would riot if they learned that a white, let alone Jewish student was attending a black school, the police removed Bakshi from his classroom. Meanwhile, his father had been suffering from anxiety attacks. Within a few months, the family moved back to Brownsville, where they rarely spoke of these events.

At the age of fifteen, after discovering Gene Byrnes&#x27; &quot;Complete Guide to Cartooning&quot; at the public library, Bakshi took up cartooning to document his experiences and create fantasy-influenced art. He stole a copy of the book and learned every lesson in it. During his teenaged years, Bakshi took up boxing. While attending Thomas Jefferson High School, he took little interest in academics, spending most of his time focusing on &quot;broads, mouthing off, and doodling&quot;. After participating in a food fight and being caught smoking, Bakshi was sent to the principal&#x27;s office. Believing Bakshi was unlikely to prosper at Thomas Jefferson, the principal transferred him to Manhattan&#x27;s School of Industrial Art. At the school, he was taught by African-American cartoonist Charles Allen. In June 1956, Bakshi graduated from the school with an award in cartooning. He attended and graduated from the School of Industrial Art (now known as the High School of Art and Design) in 1956.

==Career==

===Early career (1956–1967)===
When Bakshi was 18, his friend Cosmo Anzilotti was hired by the cartoon studio Terrytoons; Anzilotti recommended Bakshi to the studio&#x27;s production manager, Frank Schudde. Bakshi was hired as a cel polisher and commuted four hours each day to the studio, based in suburban New Rochelle. His low-level position required Bakshi to carefully remove dirt and dust from animation cels.

After a few months, Schudde was surprised that Bakshi was still showing up to work, so he promoted him to cel painter. Bakshi began to practice animating; to give himself more time, at one point he slipped 10 cels that he was supposed to work on into the &quot;to-do&quot; pile of a fellow painter, Leo Giuliani. Bakshi&#x27;s deception was not noticed until two days later, when he was called to Schudde&#x27;s office because the cels had been painted on the wrong side. When Bakshi explained that Giuliani had made the mistake, an argument ensued between the three. Schudde eventually took Bakshi&#x27;s side. By this point, the studio&#x27;s employees were aware of Bakshi&#x27;s intention to become an animator, and he received help and advice from established animators, including Connie Rasinski, Manny Davis, Jim Tyer, Larry Silverman, and Johnnie Gentilella.

Bakshi married his first wife, Elaine, when he was 21. Their son, Mark, was born when Bakshi was 22. Elaine disliked his long work hours; parodying his marital problems, Bakshi drew &quot;Dum Dum and Dee Dee&quot;, a comic strip about a man determined &quot;to get—and keep—the girl&quot;.

As he perfected his animation style, he began to take on more jobs, including creating design tests for the studio&#x27;s head director, Gene Deitch. Deitch was not convinced that Bakshi had a modern design sensibility. In response to the period&#x27;s political climate and as a form of therapy, Bakshi drew the comic strips &quot;Bonefoot and Fudge&quot;, which satirized &quot;idiots with an agenda&quot;, and &quot;Junktown&quot;, which focused on &quot;misfit technology and discarded ideals&quot;.

Bakshi&#x27;s frustrations with his failing marriage and the state of the planet further drove his need to animate. In 1959, he moved his desk to join the rest of the animators; after asking Rasinski for material to animate, he received layouts of two scenes: a hat floating on water and a running Deputy Dawg, the lead character of a Terrytoons&#x27; series then being shown on CBS. Despite threats of repercussion from the animators&#x27; union, Rasinski fought to keep Bakshi as a layout artist. Bakshi began to see Rasinski as a father figure; Rasinski, childless, was happy to serve as Bakshi&#x27;s mentor.

At the age of 25, Bakshi was promoted to director. His first assignment was the series &quot;Sad Cat&quot;. Bakshi and his wife had separated by then, giving him the time to animate each short alone. Bakshi was dissatisfied with the traditional role of a Terrytoons director: &quot;We didn&#x27;t really &#x27;direct&#x27; like you&#x27;d think. We were &#x27;animation directors,&#x27; because the story department controlled the storyboards. We couldn&#x27;t affect anything, but I still tried. I&#x27;d re-time, mix up soundtracks—I&#x27;d fuck with it so I could make it my own.&quot;

Other animation studios, such as Hanna-Barbera, were selling shows to the networks, even as the series produced by Terrytoons (which was owned by CBS) were declining in popularity. In 1966, Bill Weiss asked Bakshi to help him carry presentation boards to Manhattan for a meeting with CBS. The network executives rejected all of Weiss&#x27;s proposals as &quot;too sophisticated&quot;, &quot;too corny&quot;, or &quot;too old-timey&quot;.

As Fred Silverman, CBS&#x27;s daytime programming chief, began to leave the office, an unprepared Bakshi pitched a superhero parody called &quot;The Mighty Heroes&quot; on the spot. He described the series&#x27; characters, including Strong Man, Tornado Man, Rope Man, Cuckoo Man, and Diaper Man: &quot;They fought evil wherever they could, and the villains were stupider than they were.&quot;

The executives loved the idea, and while Silverman required a few drawings before committing, Weiss immediately put Bakshi to work on the series&#x27; development. Once Silverman saw the character designs, he confirmed that CBS would greenlight the show, on the condition that Bakshi would serve as its creative director and to oversee the entire project. It would appear as a segment of &quot;Mighty Mouse Playhouse&quot; on the network&#x27;s 1966–67 Saturday-morning schedule; the series was renamed &quot;Mighty Mouse and the Mighty Heroes&quot; in recognition of the new segment.

Bakshi received a pay raise, but was not as satisfied with his career advancement as he had anticipated; Rasinski had died in 1965, Bakshi did not have creative control over &quot;The Mighty Heroes&quot;, and he was unhappy with the quality of the animation, writing, timing, and voice acting. Although the series&#x27; first 20 segments were successful, Bakshi wanted to leave Terrytoons to form his own company. In 1967, he drew up presentation pieces for a fantasy series called &quot;Tee-Witt&quot;, with help from Anzilotti, Johnnie Zago, and Bill Foucht.

On the way to the CBS offices to make his pitch, he was involved in a car accident. At the auto body shop, he met Liz, who later became his second wife. Though CBS passed on &quot;Tee-Witt&quot;, its designs served as the basis for Bakshi&#x27;s 1977 film &quot;Wizards&quot;. While leaving the network offices, he learned that Paramount Pictures had recently fired Shamus Culhane, the head of its animation division. Bakshi met with Burt Hampft, a lawyer for the studio, and was hired to replace Culhane.

Bakshi enlisted comic-book and pulp-fiction artists and writers Harvey Kurtzman, Lin Carter, Gray Morrow, Archie Goodwin, Wally Wood, and Jim Steranko to work at the studio. After finishing Culhane&#x27;s uncompleted shorts, he directed, produced, wrote, and designed four short films at Paramount: &quot;The Fuz&quot;, &quot;Mini-Squirts&quot;, &quot;Marvin Digs&quot;, and &quot;Mouse Trek&quot;.

&quot;Marvin Digs&quot;, which Bakshi conceived as a &quot;flower child picture&quot;, was not completed the way he had intended: It &quot;was going to have curse words and sex scenes, and a lot more than that. [...] Of course, they wouldn&#x27;t let me do that.&quot; He described the disappointing result as a &quot;typical 1967 limited-animation theatrical&quot;. Animation historian Michael Barrier called the film &quot;an offensively bad picture, the kind that makes people who love animation get up and leave the theater in disgust&quot;. Production of &quot;Mighty Heroes&quot; ended when Bakshi left Terrytoons.

Bakshi served as head of the studio for eight months before Paramount closed its animation division on December 1, 1967. He learned that his position was always intended to be temporary and that Paramount never intended to pick up his pitches. Although Hampft was prepared to offer Bakshi a severance package, Bakshi immediately ripped up the contract.

Hampft suggested that Bakshi work with producer Steve Krantz, who had recently fired Culhane as supervising director on the Canadian science-fiction series &quot;Rocket Robin Hood&quot;. Bakshi and background artist Johnnie Vita soon headed to Toronto, planning to commute between Canada and New York, with artists such as Morrow and Wood working from the United States.

Unknown to Bakshi, Krantz and producer Al Guest were in the middle of a lawsuit. Failing to reach a settlement with Guest, Krantz told Bakshi to grab the series&#x27; model sheets and return to the United States. When the studio found out, a warrant for Bakshi&#x27;s arrest was issued by the Toronto police. He narrowly avoided capture before being stopped by an American border guard, who asked him what he was doing. Bakshi responded, &quot;All of these guys are heading into Canada to dodge the draft and I&#x27;m running back into the States. What the fuck is wrong with that!?&quot; The guard laughed, and let Bakshi through. Vita was detained at the airport; he was searched and interrogated for six hours.

===Bakshi Productions and &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; (1968–1972)===
Bakshi soon founded his own studio, Bakshi Productions, in the Garment District of Manhattan, where his mother used to work and which Bakshi described as &quot;the worst neighborhood in the world&quot;. Bakshi Productions paid its employees higher salaries than other studios and expanded opportunities for female and minority animators. The studio began work on &quot;Rocket Robin Hood&quot;, and later took over the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; television series. Bakshi married Liz in August 1968. His second child, Preston, was born in June 1970.

In 1969, Ralph&#x27;s Spot was founded as a division of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for Coca-Cola and &quot;Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse&quot;, a series of educational shorts paid for by Encyclopædia Britannica. Bakshi was uninterested in the kind of animation the studio was turning out, and wanted to produce something personal. He soon developed &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot;, a tale of inner-city street life. Krantz told Bakshi that Hollywood studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi&#x27;s lack of film experience, and would likely consider it if his first film was an adaptation, luckily he would find a Comic that would become his first animated feature.

While browsing the East Side Book Store on St. Mark&#x27;s Place, Bakshi came across a copy of Robert Crumb&#x27;s &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;. Impressed by Crumb&#x27;s sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film. Krantz arranged a meeting with Crumb, during which Bakshi presented the drawings he had created while learning the artist&#x27;s distinctive style to prove that he could adapt Crumb&#x27;s artwork to animation. Impressed by Bakshi&#x27;s tenacity, Crumb lent him one of his sketchbooks for reference.

Preparation began on a studio pitch that included a poster-sized cel featuring the comic&#x27;s cast against a traced photo background—as Bakshi intended the film to appear. Despite Crumb&#x27;s enthusiasm, the artist refused to sign the contract Krantz drew up. Artist Vaughn Bodē warned Bakshi against working with Crumb, describing him as &quot;slick&quot;. Bakshi later agreed with Bodé&#x27;s assessment, calling Crumb &quot;one of the slickest hustlers you&#x27;ll ever see in your life&quot;. Krantz sent Bakshi to San Francisco, where he stayed with Crumb and his wife, Dana, in an attempt to persuade Crumb to sign the contract. After a week, Crumb left, leaving the film&#x27;s production status uncertain. Two weeks after Bakshi returned to New York, Krantz entered his office and told Bakshi that he had acquired the film rights through Dana, who had Crumb&#x27;s power of attorney and signed the contract. Crumb was subsequently hostile both to the film and Bakshi. Krantz produced a sequel, &quot;The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat&quot; (1974), to which Crumb was steadfastly opposed, having wanted to kill Fritz off to avoid further movies.

After Bakshi pitched the project to every major Hollywood studio, Warner Bros. bought it and promised an $850,000 budget. Bakshi hired animators with whom he had worked in the past, including Vita, Tyer, Anzilotti, and Nick Tafuri, and began the layouts and animation. The first completed sequence was a junkyard scene in Harlem, in which Fritz smokes marijuana, has sex, and incites a revolution. Krantz intended to release the sequence as a 15-minute short in case the picture&#x27;s financing fell through; Bakshi, however, was determined to complete the film as a feature. They screened the sequence for Warner Bros. executives, who wanted the sexual content toned down and celebrities cast for the voice parts. Bakshi refused, and Warner Bros. pulled out, leading Krantz to seek funds elsewhere. He eventually made a deal with Jerry Gross, the owner of Cinemation Industries, a distributor specializing in exploitation films. Although Bakshi did not have enough time to pitch the film, Gross agreed to fund its production and distribute it, believing that it would fit in with his exploitation slate.

Despite receiving financing from other sources, including Saul Zaentz (who agreed to distribute the soundtrack album on his Fantasy Records label), the budget was tight enough to exclude pencil tests, so Bakshi had to test the animation by flipping an animator&#x27;s drawings in his hand before they were inked and painted. When a cameraman realized that the cels for the desert scenes were not wide enough and revealed the transparency, Bakshi painted a cactus to cover the mistake. Very few storyboards were used. Bakshi and Vita walked around the Lower East Side, Washington Square Park, Chinatown, and Harlem, taking moody snapshots. Artist Ira Turek inked the outlines of these photographs onto cels with a Rapidograph, the technical pen preferred by Crumb, giving the film&#x27;s backgrounds a stylized realism virtually unprecedented in animation. The tones of the watercolor backgrounds were influenced by the work of Ashcan School painters such as George Luks and John French Sloan. Among other unusual techniques, bent and fisheye camera perspectives were used to portray the way the film&#x27;s hippies and hoodlums viewed the city. Many scenes featured documentary recordings of real conversations in place of scripted dialogue; this, too, would become a signature of Bakshi&#x27;s.

In May 1971, Bakshi moved his studio to Los Angeles to hire additional animators. Some, including Rod Scribner, Dick Lundy, Virgil Walter Ross, Norman McCabe, and John Sparey, welcomed Bakshi and felt that &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; would bring diversity to the animation industry. Other animators were less pleased by Bakshi&#x27;s arrival and placed an advertisement in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, stating that his &quot;filth&quot; was unwelcome in California. By the time production wrapped, Cinemation had released Melvin Van Peebles&#x27; &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot; to considerable success, despite the X rating it had received. When the Motion Picture Association of America gave Bakshi&#x27;s film an X rating, as well, Cinemation exploited it for promotional purposes, advertising &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; as &quot;90 minutes of violence, excitement, and SEX ... he&#x27;s X-rated and animated!&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it an &quot;amusing, diverting, handsomely executed poke at youthful attitudes&quot;. John Grant writes in his book &quot;Masters of Animation&quot; that &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; was &quot;the breakthrough movie that opened brand new vistas to the commercial animator in the United States&quot;, presenting an &quot;almost disturbingly accurate&quot; portrayal &quot;of a particular stratum of Western society during a particular era, [...] as such it has dated very well.&quot; &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; was released on April 12, 1972, opening in Hollywood and Washington, D.C. A major hit, it became the most successful independent animated feature of all time. The same month as the film&#x27;s release, Bakshi&#x27;s daughter, Victoria, was born.

===&quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; (1972–1973)===

By the time &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; was released, Bakshi had become a celebrity, but his reputation was primarily based upon his having directed the first &quot;dirty&quot; animated film. Facing criticism of his work on publicity tours and in trade publications, he began writing poetry to express his emotions. This became a tradition, and Bakshi wrote poems before beginning production on each of his films. The first of these poems was &quot;Street Arabs&quot;, which preceded the production of &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; in 1972. Inspiration for the film came from penny arcades, where Bakshi often played pinball, sometimes accompanied by his 12-year-old son, Mark. Bakshi pitched &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; to Samuel Z. Arkoff, who expressed interest in his take on the &quot;tortured underground cartoonist&quot; and agreed to back the film. Krantz had not compensated Bakshi for his work on &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;, and halfway through the production of &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot;, Bakshi asked when he would be paid. Krantz responded, &quot;The picture didn&#x27;t make any money, Ralph. It&#x27;s just a lot of noise.&quot; Bakshi found Krantz&#x27;s claims dubious, as the producer had recently purchased a new BMW and a mansion in Beverly Hills. Bakshi did not have a lawyer, so he sought advice from fellow directors with whom he had become friendly, including Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and Steven Spielberg. He soon accused Krantz of ripping him off, which the producer denied.

As he continued to work on &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot;, Bakshi began pitching his next project, &quot;Harlem Nights&quot;, a film loosely based on the &quot;Uncle Remus&quot; story books. The idea interested producer Albert S. Ruddy, whom Bakshi encountered at a screening of &quot;The Godfather&quot;. Bakshi received a call from Krantz, who questioned him about &quot;Harlem Nights&quot;. Bakshi said, &quot;I can&#x27;t talk about that&quot;, and hung up. After locking Bakshi out of the studio the next day, Krantz called several directors, including Chuck Jones, in search of a replacement. Arkoff threatened to withdraw his financial backing unless Krantz rehired Bakshi, who returned a week later.

Bakshi wanted the voices to sound organic, so he experimented with improvisation, allowing his actors to ad lib during the recording sessions. Several animation sequences appear as rough sketchbook pages. The film also incorporated live-action footage and photographs. Although Krantz, in an attempt to get the film an R rating, prepared different versions of scenes involving sex and violence, &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; was rated X. Due to the success of &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;, though, many theaters were willing to book adult-oriented animation, and the film did well at the box office. Bakshi became the first person in the animation industry since Walt Disney to have two financially successful movies released consecutively. &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; was very well received by critics. &quot;Newsweek&quot; applauded its &quot;black humor, powerful grotesquerie, and peculiar raw beauty.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called it &quot;shocking, outrageous, offensive, sometimes incoherent, occasionally unintelligent. However, it is also an authentic work of movie art and Bakshi is certainly the most creative American animator since Disney.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; among his &quot;Ten Best Films of 1973&quot;. Upon release, the movie was banned by the Film Censorship Board in the province of Alberta, Canada.

===&quot;Coonskin&quot; (1973–1975)===

In 1973, Bakshi and Ruddy began the production of &quot;Harlem Nights&quot;, which Paramount was originally contracted to distribute. While &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; and &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; proved that adult-oriented animation could be financially successful, animated films were still not respected, and Bakshi&#x27;s pictures were considered to be &quot;dirty Disney flicks&quot; that were &quot;mature&quot; only for depicting sex, drugs, and profanity. &quot;Harlem Nights&quot;, based on Bakshi&#x27;s firsthand experiences with racism, was an attack on racist prejudices and stereotypes. Bakshi cast Scatman Crothers, Philip Michael Thomas, Barry White, and Charles Gordone in live-action and voice roles, cutting in and out of animation abruptly rather than seamlessly because he wanted to prove that the two media could &quot;coexist with neither excuse nor apology&quot;. He wrote a song for Crothers to sing during the opening title sequence: &quot;Ah&#x27;m a Niggerman&quot;. Its structure was rooted in the history of the slave plantation - slaves would &quot;shout&quot; lines from poems and stories great distances across fields in unison, creating a natural beat. Bakshi has described its vocal style, backed by fast guitar licks, as an &quot;early version of rap&quot;.

Bakshi intended to attack stereotypes by portraying them directly, culling imagery from blackface iconography. Early designs in which the main characters (Brother Rabbit, Brother Bear, and Preacher Fox) resembled figures from &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; were rejected. Bakshi juxtaposed stereotypical designs of blacks with even more negative depictions of white racists, but the film&#x27;s strongest criticism is directed at the Mafia. Bakshi said, &quot;I was sick of all the hero worship these guys got because of &quot;The Godfather&quot;.&quot; Production concluded in 1973. During editing, the title was changed to &quot;Coonskin No More...&quot;, and finally to &quot;Coonskin&quot;. Bakshi hired several African-American animators to work on &quot;Coonskin&quot;, including Brenda Banks, the first African-American female animator. Bakshi also hired graffiti artists and trained them to work as animators. The film&#x27;s release was delayed by protests from the Congress of Racial Equality, which called Bakshi and his film racist. After its distribution was contracted to the Bryanston Distributing Company, Paramount cancelled a project that Bakshi and Ruddy were developing, &quot;The American Chronicles&quot;.

&quot;Coonskin&quot;, advertised as an exploitation film, was given limited distribution and soon disappeared from theaters. Initial reviews were negative; &quot;Playboy&quot; commented that &quot;Bakshi seems to throw in a little of everything and he can&#x27;t quite pull it together.&quot; Eventually, positive reviews appeared in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot; (an African-American newspaper), and elsewhere. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Richard Eder said the film &quot;could be [Bakshi&#x27;s] masterpiece [...] a shattering successful effort to use an uncommon form—cartoons and live action combined-to convey the hallucinatory violence and frustration of American city life, specifically black city life [...] lyrically violent, yet in no way [does it] exploit violence&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; called it a &quot;brutal satire from the streets&quot;. A reviewer for the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Examiner&quot; wrote, &quot;Certainly, it will outrage some and, indeed, it&#x27;s not Disney. [...] The dialog it has obviously generated—if not the box-office obstacles—seems joltingly healthy.&quot; Bakshi called &quot;Coonskin&quot; his best film.

===&quot; Hey Good Lookin&#x27; &quot; (1973–1975/1982)===

After production concluded on &quot;Harlem Nights&quot;, Bakshi wanted to distinguish himself artistically by producing a film in which live action and animated characters would interact. Bakshi said, &quot;The illusion I attempted to create was that of a completely live-action film. Making it work almost drove us crazy.&quot; &quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27;&quot; is set in Brooklyn during the 1950s; its lead characters are Vinnie, the leader of a gang named &quot;The Stompers&quot;, his friend Crazy Shapiro, and their girlfriends, Roz and Eva. Vinnie and Crazy Shapiro were based on Bakshi&#x27;s high-school friends Norman Darrer and Allen Schechterman. Warner Bros. optioned the screenplay and greenlit the film in 1973.

An initial version of &quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27;&quot; was completed in 1975. A three-minute promotion of this version was screened at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival, and the film was scheduled for a Christmas 1975 release, but was moved to the summers of 1976 and later 1977, before ultimately being postponed indefinitely. Warner Bros. was concerned about any controversy the film would encounter as a result of the backlash over the film &quot;Coonskin&quot;, and felt that the film was &quot;unreleasable&quot; because of its mix of live action and animation, and it would not spend further money on the project. Bakshi financed the film&#x27;s completion himself from the director&#x27;s fees for other projects such as &quot;Wizards&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and &quot;American Pop&quot;. The live-action sequences of &quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27;&quot; were gradually replaced by animation; among the eliminated live-action sequences was one featuring the glam punk band New York Dolls. Singer Dan Hicks worked on the initial musical score, but the final version was scored by John Madara.

&quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27;&quot; opened in New York City on October 1, 1982, and was released in Los Angeles in January 1983. The film&#x27;s release was limited, and went largely unnoticed in the United States, although it garnered respectable business in foreign markets. In a brief review, Vincent Canby wrote that it was &quot;not exactly incoherent, but whatever it originally had on its mind seems to have slipped away&quot;. Animation historian Jerry Beck wrote, &quot;the beginning of the film is quite promising, with a garbage can discussing life on the streets with some garbage. This is an example of what Bakshi did best—using the medium of animation to comment on society. Unfortunately, he doesn&#x27;t do it enough in this film. There is a wildly imaginative fantasy sequence during the climax, when the character named Crazy starts hallucinating during a rooftop shooting spree. This scene almost justifies the whole film. But otherwise, this is a rehash of ideas better explored in &quot;Coonskin&quot;, &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot;, and &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;.&quot; The film has since gained a cult following through cable television and home video. Quentin Tarantino stated that he preferred &quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27;&quot; to Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Mean Streets&quot;.

===Shift to fantasy film (1976–1978)===

In 1976, Bakshi pitched &quot;War Wizards&quot; to 20th Century Fox. Returning to the fantasy drawings he had created in high school for inspiration, Bakshi intended to prove that he could produce a &quot;family picture&quot; that had the same impact as his adult-oriented films. British illustrator Ian Miller and comic book artist Mike Ploog were hired to contribute backgrounds and designs. The crew included Vita, Turek, Sparey, Vitello and Spence, who had become comfortable with Bakshi&#x27;s limited storyboarding and lack of pencil tests. As the production costs increased, Fox president Alan Ladd, Jr. declined Bakshi&#x27;s requests for salary increases, and refused to give him $50,000 to complete the film. At the same time, Ladd was dealing with similar budget problems on George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Bakshi and Lucas had negotiated contracts entitling them to franchise ownership, merchandising and back-end payment, so Ladd suggested that they fund the completion of their films themselves.

Bakshi chose rotoscoping as a cost-effective way to complete the movie&#x27;s battle scenes with his own finances. Because he could not afford to hire a film crew or actors, or develop 35mm stock, Bakshi requested prints of films that contained the type of large battle scenes needed, including Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;, and spliced together the footage he needed. However, the cost of printing photographs of each frame would have cost $3 million. Learning that IBM had introduced an industrial-sized photocopier, Bakshi asked one of the company&#x27;s technical experts if he would be able to feed 35mm reels into the machine to produce enlarged copies of each frame. The experiment worked, and Bakshi got the pages he needed for a penny per copy.

As &quot;War Wizards&quot; neared completion, Lucas requested that Bakshi change the title of his film to &quot;Wizards&quot; to avoid conflict with &quot;Star Wars&quot;; Bakshi agreed because Lucas had allowed Mark Hamill to take time off from &quot;Star Wars&quot; to record a voice for &quot;Wizards&quot;. Although &quot;Wizards&quot; received a limited release, it was successful in the theaters that showed it and developed a worldwide audience. Dave Kehr of &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; saw it as &quot;marred by cut-rate techniques and a shapeless screenplay&quot;. In the view of film historian Jerry Beck, the lead character, an aging sorcerer, &quot;clearly owes much to cartoonist Vaughn Bodé&#x27;s Cheech Wizard character.&quot;

In late 1976, Bakshi learned that John Boorman was contracted to direct an adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, in which J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s three-volume novel would be condensed into a single film. Bakshi arranged a meeting with Mike Medavoy, United Artists&#x27; head of production, who agreed to let Bakshi direct in exchange for the $3 million that had been spent on Boorman&#x27;s screenplay. Down the hall from Medavoy was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer president Dan Melnick, who interrupted a meeting with Peter Bogdanovich when he learned that Bakshi wanted to discuss acquiring the rights to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Melnick agreed to pay United Artists $3 million, but was soon fired; the project was canceled by his replacement, Dick Shepherd. Bakshi contacted Saul Zaentz, who wrote a check to cover MGM&#x27;s debt and agreed to fund the $8 million budget for the first of what was initially planned as a series of three films, and later negotiated down to two. Before production began, Bakshi and Zaentz insisted that the Tolkien estate receive residuals from the film.

Bakshi did not want to produce a broad cartoon version of the tale, so he planned to shoot the entire film in live action and animate the footage with rotoscoping. The film also incorporated brief cel animation and straightforward live-action footage. Production of the live-action sequences took place in Spain. During the middle of a large shoot, union bosses called for a lunch break, and Bakshi secretly shot footage of actors in Orc costumes moving toward the craft service table, and used the footage in the film. Jerry Beck later wrote that, while he found the rotoscoped animation &quot;beautiful&quot;, he felt that it was unclear whether the use of live action was an artistic choice or due to budgetary constraints.

After the Spanish film development lab discovered that telephone lines, helicopters and cars were visible in the footage, they tried to incinerate it, telling Bakshi&#x27;s first assistant director, &quot;if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would ever come back to Spain to shoot again.&quot; When Bakshi returned to the United States, he learned that the cost of developing blown-up prints of each frame had risen. He did not want to repeat the process that had been used on &quot;Wizards&quot;, which was unsuitable for the level of detail he intended for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, so Bakshi and camera technician Ted Bemiller created their own photographic enlarger to process the footage cheaply. Live-action special effects and analog optics were used in place of animation to keep the visual effects budget low and give the film a more realistic look. Among the voice actors was the well-regarded John Hurt, who performed the role of Aragorn. The project&#x27;s prominence brought heavy trade journal coverage, and fans such as Mick Jagger visited the studio for the chance to play a role. Animator Carl Bell loved drawing Aragorn so much that Bakshi gave Bell the live-action Aragorn costume, which he wore while animating.

Viewing &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as a holiday film, United Artists pressured Bakshi to complete it on schedule for its intended November 15, 1978, release. Once it was finished, Bakshi was told that audiences would not pay to see an incomplete story; over his objections, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was marketed with no indication that a second part would follow. Reviews of the film were mixed, but it was generally seen as a &quot;flawed but inspired interpretation&quot;. &quot;Newsday&quot;″s Joseph Gelmis wrote that &quot;the film&#x27;s principal reward is a visual experience unlike anything that other animated features are doing at the moment&quot;. Roger Ebert called Bakshi&#x27;s effort a &quot;mixed blessing&quot; and &quot;an entirely respectable, occasionally impressive job [which] still falls far short of the charm and sweep of the original story&quot;. Vincent Canby found it &quot;both numbing and impressive&quot;. David Denby of &quot;New York&quot; felt that the film would not make sense to viewers who had not read the book. He wrote that it was too dark and lacked humor, concluding, &quot;The lurid, meaningless violence of this movie left me exhausted and sickened by the end.&quot; The film, which cost $4 million to produce, grossed $30.5 million. The studio refused to fund the sequel, which would have adapted the remainder of the story. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; won the Golden Gryphon at the 1980 Giffoni Film Festival.

===&quot;American Pop&quot; and &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; (1979–1983)===
Following the production struggles of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Bakshi decided to work on something more personal. He pitched &quot;American Pop&quot; to Columbia Pictures president Dan Melnick. Bakshi wanted to produce a film in which songs would be given a new context in juxtaposition to the visuals. &quot;American Pop&quot; follows four generations of a Russian Jewish immigrant family of musicians, whose careers parallel the history of American pop and starred actor Ron Thompson in a dual lead role. While the film does not reflect Bakshi&#x27;s own experiences, its themes were strongly influenced by people he had encountered in Brownsville. The film&#x27;s crew included character layout and design artist Louise Zingarelli, Vita, Barry E. Jackson, and Marcia Adams. Bakshi again used rotoscoping, in an attempt to capture the range of emotions and movement required for the film&#x27;s story. According to Bakshi, &quot;Rotoscoping is terrible for subtleties, so it was tough to get facial performances to match the stage ones.&quot; Bakshi was able to acquire the rights to an extensive soundtrack—including songs by Janis Joplin, The Doors, George Gershwin, The Mamas &amp; the Papas, Herbie Hancock, Lou Reed, and Louis Prima—for under $1 million. Released on February 12, 1981, the film was a financial success. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Vincent Canby wrote, &quot;I&#x27;m amazed at the success that Mr. Bakshi has in turning animated characters into figures of real feelings.&quot; Jerry Beck called it &quot;one of Bakshi&#x27;s best films&quot;. Due to music clearance issues, it was not released on home video until 1998.

By 1982, fantasy films such as &quot;The Beastmaster&quot; and &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; had proven successful at the box office, and Bakshi wanted to work with his long-time friend, the fantasy illustrator Frank Frazetta. &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; was financed by some of &quot;American Pop&quot;″s investors for $1.2 million, while 20th Century Fox agreed to distribute. &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; was the most action-oriented story Bakshi had directed, so he again used rotoscoping; the realism of the design and rotoscoped animation replicated Frazetta&#x27;s artwork. Bakshi and Frazetta were heavily involved in the production of the live-action sequences, from casting sessions to the final shoot. The film&#x27;s crew included background artists James Gurney and Thomas Kinkade, layout artist Peter Chung, and established Bakshi Productions artists Sparey, Steve Gordon, Bell and Banks. Chung greatly admired Bakshi&#x27;s and Frazetta&#x27;s work, and animated his sequences while working for The Walt Disney Company. The film was given a limited release, and was financially unsuccessful. Andrew Leal wrote, &quot;The plot is standard [...] recalling nothing so much as a more graphic episode of Filmation&#x27;s &quot;He-Man&quot; series. [...] &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; essentially stands as a footnote to the spate of barbarian films that followed in the wake of Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s appearance as Conan.&quot;

===Unproduced projects and temporary retirement (1983–1986)===
After production of &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; wrapped, Bakshi attempted several projects that fell through, including adaptations of Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, William Kotzwinkle&#x27;s &quot;The Fan Man&quot;, E. R. Eddison&#x27;s &quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot;, Stephen Crane&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, Mickey Spillane&#x27;s Mike Hammer novels and an anthropomorphic depiction of Sherlock Holmes. He turned down offers to direct Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; and Philip K. Dick&#x27;s &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;. He passed the latter to Ridley Scott, who adapted it into the 1982 film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (although he was planning a TV version of said film).

During this period, Bakshi reread J. D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, which he had first read in high school, and saw parallels between his situation and that of the book&#x27;s protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Inspired to seek the film rights, he intended to shoot the story&#x27;s bracketing sequences in live action and to animate the core flashback scenes. Salinger had rejected previous offers to adapt the novel, and had not made a public appearance since 1965 or granted an interview since 1980. Bakshi sent Salinger a letter explaining why he should be allowed to adapt the novel; the writer responded by thanking Bakshi and asserting that the novel was unfit for any medium other than its original form.

Prompted in part by Salinger&#x27;s letter, Bakshi briefly retired to focus on painting. During this time he completed the screenplay for &quot;If I Catch Her, I&#x27;ll Kill Her&quot;, a live-action feature he had been developing since the late 1960s. United Artists and Paramount Pictures each paid Bakshi to develop the film in the 1970s, but were unwilling to produce it, as were the studios he pitched the film to in the 1980s. According to Bakshi, &quot;They thought that no one was going to admit that women can—and do—cheat on their husbands. They thought it was too hot, which made no sense.&quot; In 1985, he received a phone call from The Rolling Stones&#x27; manager, Tony King, who told Bakshi that the band had recorded a cover of Bob &amp; Earl&#x27;s &quot;Harlem Shuffle&quot;, and wanted Bakshi to direct the music video. He was told that the live-action shoot needed to be completed within one day (January 28, 1986) for it to be shown at the Grammy Awards. Production designer Wolf Kroeger was forced to drastically compact his sets, and animation director and designer John Kricfalusi had to push his team, including Lynne Naylor, Jim Smith and Bob Jaques, to complete the animation within a few weeks. The band&#x27;s arrival at the set was delayed by a snowstorm and several takes were ruined when the cameras crossed paths. Bakshi was forced to pay the union wages out of his own fees, and the continuity between Kricfalusi&#x27;s animation and the live-action footage did not match; however, the video was completed on time.

Bakshi recognized Kricfalusi&#x27;s talent, and wanted to put him in charge of a project that would showcase the young animator&#x27;s skills. Bakshi and Kricfalusi co-wrote the screenplay &quot;Bobby&#x27;s Girl&quot; as a take on the teen films of the era. Jeff Sagansky, president of production at TriStar Pictures, put up $150,000 to develop the project, prompting Bakshi to move back to Los Angeles. When Sagansky left TriStar, Bakshi was forced to pitch the film again, but the studio&#x27;s new executives did not understand its appeal and cut off financing. Bakshi and Zingarelli began to develop a feature about Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age, and Bakshi Productions crewmembers worked on proposed cartoons influenced by pulp fiction. &quot;Bobby&#x27;s Girl&quot; was reworked as a potential prime time series called &quot;Suzy&#x27;s in Love&quot;, but attracted no serious interest. They would try again in 2003 over at Spümcø, but nothing came from this either.

===Return to television (1987–1989)===

In April 1987, Bakshi set up a meeting with Judy Price, the head of CBS&#x27;s Saturday morning block. Three days before the meeting, Bakshi, Kricfalusi, Naylor, Tom Minton, Eddie Fitzgerald and Jim Reardon met to brainstorm. Bakshi remembers, &quot;My car was packed to the windows. Judy was my last stop before driving cross country back to New York to my family.&quot; Price rejected Bakshi&#x27;s prepared pitches, but asked what else he had. He told her that he had the rights to &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot;, and she agreed to purchase the series. However, Bakshi did not own the rights and did not know who did. While researching the rights, he learned that CBS had acquired the entire Terrytoons library in 1955 and forgotten about it. According to Bakshi, &quot;I sold them a show they already owned, so they just gave me the rights for nothin&#x27;!&quot;

Kricfalusi&#x27;s team wrote story outlines for thirteen episodes in a week and pitched them to Price. By the next week, Kricfalusi had hired animators he knew who had been working at other studios. &quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot; went into production the month it was greenlighted; it was scheduled to premiere on September 19, 1987. This haste required the crew to be split into four teams, led by supervising director Kricfalusi, Fitzgerald, Steve Gordon and Bruce Woodside. Each team was given a handful of episodes, and operated almost entirely independently of the others. Although the scripts required approval by CBS executives, Kricfalusi insisted that the artists add visual gags as they drew. Bruce Timm, Andrew Stanton, Dave Marshall and Jeff Pidgeon were among the artists who worked on the series. Despite the time constraints, CBS was pleased with the way Bakshi Productions addressed the network&#x27;s notes.

During the production of the episode &quot;The Littlest Tramp&quot;, editor Tom Klein expressed concern that a sequence showing Mighty Mouse sniffing the remains of a crushed flower resembled cocaine use. Bakshi did not initially view the footage; he believed that Klein was overreacting, but agreed to let him cut the scene. Kricfalusi expressed disbelief over the cut, insisting that the action was harmless and that the sequence should be restored. Following Kricfalusi&#x27;s advice, Bakshi told Klein to restore the scene, which had been approved by network executives and the CBS standards and practices department. The episode aired on October 31, 1987, without controversy.

In 1988, Bakshi received an Annie Award for &quot;Distinguished Contribution to the Art of Animation&quot;. The same year, he began production on a series pilot loosely adapted from his &quot;Junktown&quot; comic strips. According to Bakshi, the proposed series &quot;was going to be a revitalization of cartoon style from the &#x27;20s and &#x27;30s. It was gonna have Duke Ellington and Fats Waller jazzing up the soundtrack.&quot; Nickelodeon was initially willing to greenlight 39 episodes of &quot;Junktown&quot;.

On June 6, 1988, Donald Wildmon, head of the American Family Association (AFA), alleged that &quot;The Littlest Tramp&quot; depicted cocaine use, instigating a media frenzy. The AFA, during its incarnation as the National Federation for Decency, had previously targeted CBS as an &quot;accessory to murder&quot; after a mother killed her daughter following an airing of &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot;. Concerning Bakshi&#x27;s involvement with &quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot;, the AFA claimed that CBS &quot;intentionally hired a known pornographer to do a cartoon for children, and then allowed him to insert a scene in which the cartoon hero is shown sniffing cocaine.&quot; Bakshi responded, &quot;You could pick a still out of &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; and get the same impression. &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; wasn&#x27;t pornography. It was social commentary. This all smacks of burning books and the Third Reich. It smacks of McCarthyism. I&#x27;m not going to get into who sniffs what. This is lunacy!&quot; On CBS&#x27;s order, Klein removed the sequence from the master broadcast footage. Wildmon claimed that the edits were &quot;a de facto admission that, indeed, Mighty Mouse was snorting cocaine&quot;. Despite receiving an award from Action for Children&#x27;s Television, favorable reviews, and a ranking in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best of &#x27;87&quot; feature, &quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot; was canceled by CBS following the controversy.

The incident had a ripple effect, weakening Nickelodeon&#x27;s commitment to &quot;Junktown&quot;. Bakshi has also stated that &quot;we were trying something different [...] but a series didn&#x27;t make sense. It just didn&#x27;t work&quot;. The series was scrapped, and the completed pilot aired as a special, &quot;Christmas in Tattertown&quot;, in December 1988. It was the first original animated special created for Nickelodeon. Bakshi moved into a warehouse loft in downtown Los Angeles to clear his head, and was offered $50,000 to direct a half-hour live-action film for PBS&#x27;s &quot;Imagining America&quot; anthology series. Mark Bakshi produced the film, &quot;This Ain&#x27;t Bebop&quot;, his first professional collaboration with his father. Bakshi wrote a poem influenced by Jack Kerouac, jazz, the Beat Generation and Brooklyn that served as the narration, which was spoken by Harvey Keitel. After a car crash, Bakshi completed the post-production in stitches and casts. Bakshi said of the work, &quot;It&#x27;s the most proud I&#x27;ve been of a picture since &quot;Coonskin&quot;—the last real thing I did with total integrity.&quot;

As a result of the film, Bakshi received an offer to adapt Dr. Seuss&#x27;s &quot;The Butter Battle Book&quot; for TNT. Ted Geisel had never been satisfied with the previous screen versions of his Dr. Seuss work. Bakshi wanted to produce an entirely faithful adaptation, and Geisel—who agreed to storyboard the special himself—was pleased with the final product. Bakshi next directed the pilot &quot;Hound Town&quot; for NBC; he described the result as &quot;an embarrassing piece of shit&quot;. Besides Bakshi, sitcom alumnus Rob Sternin and Prudence Fraser wrote and produced the project.

===&quot;Cool World&quot;, continued television projects and semi-retirement (1990–1997)===

In 1990, Bakshi pitched &quot;Cool World&quot; to Paramount Pictures as a partially animated horror film. The concept involved a cartoon and human having sex and conceiving a hybrid child who visits the real world to murder the father who abandoned him. The live-action footage was intended to look like &quot;a living, walk-through painting&quot;, a visual concept Bakshi had long wanted to achieve. Massive sets were constructed on a sound stage in Las Vegas, based on enlargements of designer Barry Jackson&#x27;s paintings. The animation was strongly influenced by the house styles of Fleischer Studios and Terrytoons. As the sets were being built, producer Frank Mancuso Jr., son of Paramount president Frank Mancuso Sr., had the screenplay rewritten in secret; the new version, by Michael Grais and Mark Victor, was radically different from Bakshi&#x27;s original. Paramount threatened to sue Bakshi if he did not complete the film. As Bakshi and Mancuso wrangled over their creative differences, Bakshi and the studio also began to fight over the film&#x27;s casting. To keep actor Brad Pitt, Bakshi had to replace Drew Barrymore, his original choice for the character of Holli Would, with Kim Basinger, a bigger box office draw at the time. The film&#x27;s animators were never given a screenplay, and were instead told by Bakshi, &quot;Do a scene that&#x27;s funny, whatever you want to do!&quot;
Designer Milton Knight recalled that &quot;audiences actually wanted a wilder, raunchier &quot;Cool World&quot;. The premiere audience I saw it with certainly did.&quot; The critical reaction to the film was generally negative. Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;The DJ who was hosting the radio station&#x27;s free preview of &quot;Cool World&quot; leaped onto the stage and promised the audience: &#x27;If you liked &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot;, you&#x27;ll love &quot;Cool World&quot;!&#x27; He was wrong, but you can&#x27;t blame him—he hadn&#x27;t seen the movie. I have, and I will now promise you that if you liked &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot;, quit while you&#x27;re ahead.&quot; The film was a box-office disappointment. While other film projects followed, Bakshi began to focus more attention on painting.

In 1993, Lou Arkoff, the son of Samuel Z. Arkoff, approached Bakshi to write and direct a low-budget live-action feature for Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Rebel Highway&quot; series. For the third time, Bakshi revisited his screenplay for &quot;If I Catch Her, I&#x27;ll Kill Her&quot;, which he retitled &quot;Cool and the Crazy&quot;. The picture, which aired September 16, 1994, starred Jared Leto, Alicia Silverstone, Jennifer Blanc and Matthew Flint. Reviewer Todd Everett noted that it had the same &quot;hyperdrive visual sense&quot; of Bakshi&#x27;s animated films. He said, &quot;Everything in &#x27;Cool&#x27; [...] seems to exist in pastels and Bakshi shoots from more odd angles than any director since Sidney J. Furie in his heyday. And the closing sequences ably demonstrate how it&#x27;s possible to present strong violence without any blood being shed onscreen. Bakshi pulls strong [performances] from a cadre of youngish and largely unknown actors&quot;.

In 1995, Hanna-Barbera producer Fred Seibert offered Bakshi the chance to create two animated short films for Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot;: &quot;Malcom and Melvin&quot; and &quot;Babe, He Calls Me&quot;, focusing on a trumpet-playing cockroach named Malcom and his best friend, a clown named Melvin. Both were heavily edited after Bakshi turned them in and he disowned them as a result. Bakshi was subsequently contacted by HBO, which was looking to launch the first animated series specifically for adults, an interest stirred by discussions involving a series based upon Trey Parker and Matt Stone&#x27;s video Christmas card, &quot;Jesus vs. Santa&quot;. Bakshi enlisted a team of writers, including his son Preston, to develop &quot;Spicy Detective&quot;, later renamed &quot;Spicy City&quot;, an anthology series set in a noir-ish, technology-driven future. Each episode was narrated by a female host named Raven, voiced by Michelle Phillips. The series premiered in July 1997—one month before the debut of Parker and Stone&#x27;s &quot;South Park&quot;—and thus became the first &quot;adults only&quot; cartoon series. Although critical reaction was largely unfavorable, &quot;Spicy City&quot; received acceptable ratings. A second season was approved, but the network wanted to fire Bakshi&#x27;s writing team and hire professional Los Angeles screenwriters. When Bakshi refused to cooperate, the series was canceled.

===Painting, teaching and final animation projects (1997–2015)===
Bakshi retired from animation once more, returning to his painting. In 2000, he began teaching an undergraduate animation class at New York&#x27;s School of Visual Arts. On December 14, 2001, he did some paintings for the Cameron Crowe film &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;. He later became involved in several screen projects, including a development deal with the Sci Fi Channel, In September 2002, Bakshi, Liz and their dogs moved to New Mexico, where he became more productive than ever in his painting and began development on the Last Days of Coney Island film. In 2003, he appeared as the Fire Chief in the episode &quot;Fire Dogs 2&quot; of John Kricfalusi&#x27;s &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot;&quot;; the episode starts as a repeat of the plot of the original episode, only to quickly drop it just under a minute in, as the Chief&#x27;s appearance suddenly transforms into that of Bakshi and the episode instead revolves around the pair living with the Chief.

In September 2008, Main Street Pictures announced that it would collaborate with Bakshi on a sequel to &quot;Wizards&quot;. In 2012, Bakshi began producing the short film series &quot;Bakshi Blues&quot;. The first of these shorts, &quot;Trickle Dickle Down&quot;, contains reused animation from &quot;Coonskin&quot; and criticizes 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. The shorts were to focus on &quot;old and new characters&quot; and comment on modern-day America.

In February 2013, Bakshi launched a successful Kickstarter campaign to obtain funding for his latest film, &quot;Last Days of Coney Island&quot;. Actor Matthew Modine was cast in the film in February 2013 after Modine, a longtime Bakshi fan, came across the film&#x27;s Kickstarter campaign online. &quot;Last Days of Coney Island&quot; was released on Vimeo in 2015. Bakshi released the film for free on YouTube on 13 October 2016.

===Post-animation (2016–present)===
After he quit the animation industry, Bakshi did multiple interviews with the media and on podcasts. He continues to sell art on eBay and his website, both run by the Bakshi family. He currently sells an art series called Little Guys and Gals, which are fictional portraits of cartoon people. The series originated in November 2020 as random character sketches and officially began in January 2021, originally calling the series Little Gals and Little Guys. Bakshi appeared as a guest at a Canadian film festival which celebrates animation, SPARK Animation, which was held virtually, from October 28 to November 7, 2021.

==Accolades==
In 2003 Bakshi received a Maverick Tribute Award at the Cinequest San Jose Film Festival; the same year he began teaching an animation class in New Mexico – this became The Bakshi School of Animation and Cartooning, which is run by Ralph&#x27;s son Edward and his partner Jess Gorell.

The Online Film Critics Society released a list of the &quot;Top 100 Animated Features of All Time&quot; in March 2003 that included four of Bakshi&#x27;s films: &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Coonskin&quot; and &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;. &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; was ranked number 56 in the 2004 poll conducted by Britain&#x27;s Channel 4 for its documentary &quot;The 100 Greatest Cartoons&quot;. The Museum of Modern Art has added Bakshi&#x27;s films to its collection for preservation.

In the 1980s and 1990s he served on the advisory board of the Los Angeles Student Film Institute.

In 2021, Ralph Bakshi won the Animafest Zagreb Lifetime Achievement Award for his animation career and the impact of his films.

==Legacy==
The availability of Bakshi&#x27;s work on the Internet sparked a resurgence of interest in his career, resulting in a three-day American Cinematheque retrospective held at Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood and the Aero Theater in Santa Monica, California, in April 2005. &quot;Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi&quot;, a hardcover book of Bakshi&#x27;s art, was released on April 1, 2008. The foreword was written by Quentin Tarantino and the afterword by Bakshi. His rotoscoping techniques in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; inspired the animation rotoscoping techniques of the independent film &quot;The Spine of Night&quot;, in which the animator developed his own rotoscope style by watching behind-the-scenes footage of Bakshi&#x27;s warehouse and reverse-engineering it. Billie Eilish had the idea for an animated version of herself for her in the concert film &quot;Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter to Los Angeles&quot; (which is a promotion for the album of the same name) and suggested to director Patrick Osborne that the character should have a 1980s look and rotoscope-ish animation. Eilish referenced the works of Bakshi and animator Richard Williams to him.

Gore Verbinski commented about Bakshi and showed that he was inspired by him during an interview in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; for his first animated movie, &quot;Rango&quot;, saying: &quot;What happened to the Ralph Bakshis of the world? We&#x27;re all sitting here talking family entertainment. Does animation have to be family entertainment? Audiences want something new; they just can&#x27;t articulate what.&quot;

On January 12, 2014, at The Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood, there was a special screening of Bakshi&#x27;s film &quot;American Pop&quot; with actors Ron Thompson and Mews Small in attendance, it was the first time lead actor Ron Thompson had ever introduced the film before a live audience.

At the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica, California, on March 27, 2015, there was a screening of &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; and &quot;American Pop&quot; with Bakshi, Ron Thompson and Mews Small attending. From February 17 to February 26 of 2023, Bakshi&#x27;s entire theatrical filmography was screened in Tinker Street Cinema, which is located in Woodstock, NY.

&quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; has also been called an animated art film.

<text>Dundalk (named after Dundalk in Ireland), first called McDowell&#x27;s Corners, was originally located on the Toronto-Sydenham Road (now Hwy.10), but moved about a mile to the west to be closer to the Toronto Grey and Bruce railway when it went through in the 1870s. Dundalk was incorporated as a village in 1887. On January 1, 2000, it was amalgamated with the Township of Proton and the Township of Egremont to form the Township of Southgate, in the southeast corner of Grey County. The mayor of Southgate is Briane Milne. Dundalk services the surrounding agricultural area and also has a few small manufacturing plants. Dundalk has the highest elevation of any populated place in southern Ontario at 526m (1,726 feet). A rail line that used to pass through Dundalk is now removed, but its roadbed has become a multi-use trail sponsored by the federal government.

Dundalk has a population of 2,803, according to Statistics Canada 2021 Census Profile. 

==Community==
Dundalk&#x27;s schools are: Proton Community School (K-2), and Highpoint Community School (3-8). Most students who graduate from Highpoint continue their education at Grey Highlands Secondary School.

Dundalk is home to an arena and community centre located at 550 Main St. E. The community centre provides facilities for lacrosse, hockey and skating and can accommodate banquet seating up to 250 people. Dundalk also houses a new library, Southgate Ruth Harvgrave Memorial Library, located at 80 Proton St. N, in the Southgate Community Services Building.

Dundalk and the surrounding area is served by a local newspaper, the Dundalk Herald which was purchased in the 1960s by its present owners&#x27; parents, Walter and Phylis Walls. The Dundalk Herald is one of the last independently owned newspapers in the area.

==Climate==
Dundalk features a humid continental climate of the warm-summer variety (&quot;Dfb&quot;) given its high elevation (1,735 feet) and inland location. The town often sees cold, snowy winters and warm, sometimes humid, summers. Due to its position downwind of Lake Huron, Dundalk is in the traditional lake-effect snowbelt region of Southern Ontario, an area that can see up to 300 centimeters of snow in a year. As such, the transition months of spring and fall, especially the latter, are short due to late season snowfalls that can occur as early as late October and as late as May.

== Media ==
The &quot;Dundalk Herald&quot; is published here, and since 1968, in-tandem with the &quot;Flesherton Advance&quot;, known as the &quot;Advance&quot;.

==Religion==
Dundalk has churches representing Catholic, Anglican, (Methodist) and Protestant denominations.

==Location==
Dundalk is approximately 125 kilometres northwest from downtown Toronto, by road.

<text>A military, also known collectively as armed forces, is a heavily armed, highly organized force primarily intended for warfare. Militaries are typically authorized and maintained by a sovereign state, with their members identifiable by a distinct military uniform. They may consist of one or more military branches such as an army, navy, air force, space force, marines, or coast guard. The main task of a military is usually defined as defence of their state and its interests against external armed threats.

In broad usage, the terms &quot;armed forces&quot; and &quot;military&quot; are often synonymous, although in technical usage a distinction is sometimes made in which a country&#x27;s armed forces may include other paramilitary forces such as armed police.

Beyond warfare, the military may be employed in additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within the state, including internal security threats, crowd control, promotion of political agendas, emergency services and reconstruction, protecting corporate economic interests, social ceremonies, and national honour guards.
A nation&#x27;s military may function as a discrete social subculture, with dedicated infrastructure such as military housing, schools, utilities, logistics, hospitals, legal services, food production, finance, and banking services.

The profession of soldiering is older than recorded history. Some images of classical antiquity portray the power and feats of military leaders. The Battle of Kadesh in 1274 BC from the reign of Ramses II, features in bas-relief monuments. The first Emperor of a unified China, Qin Shi Huang, created the Terracotta Army to represent his military might.
The Ancient Romans wrote many treatises and writings on warfare, as well as many decorated triumphal arches and victory columns.

==Etymology and definitions==

The first recorded use of the word &quot;military&quot; in English, spelled , was in 1582. It comes from the Latin (from Latin ) through French, but is of uncertain etymology, one suggestion being derived from &quot;*mil-it-&quot; – going in a body or mass.

As a noun phrase, &quot;the military&quot; usually refers generally to a country&#x27;s armed forces, or sometimes, more specifically, to the senior officers who command them. In general, it refers to the physicality of armed forces, their personnel, equipment, and the physical area which they occupy.

As an adjective, military originally referred only to soldiers and soldiering, but it broadened to apply to land forces in general, and anything to do with their profession. The names of both the Royal Military Academy (1741) and United States Military Academy (1802) reflect this. However, at about the time of the Napoleonic Wars, &quot;military&quot; began to be used in reference to armed forces as a whole, such as &quot;military service&quot;, &quot;military intelligence&quot;, and &quot;military history&quot;. As such, it now connotes any activity performed by armed force personnel.

==History==
Military history is often considered to be the history of all conflicts, not just the history of the state militaries. It differs somewhat from the history of war, with military history focusing on the people and institutions of war-making, while the history of war focuses on the evolution of war itself in the face of changing technology, governments, and geography.

Military history has a number of facets. One main facet is to learn from past accomplishments and mistakes, so as to more effectively wage war in the future. Another is to create a sense of military tradition, which is used to create cohesive military forces. Still, another is to learn to prevent wars more effectively. Human knowledge about the military is largely based on both recorded and oral history of military conflicts (war), their participating armies and navies and, more recently, air forces.

==Organization==

===Personnel and units===

Despite the growing importance of military technology, military activity depends above all on people. For example, in 2000 the British Army declared: &quot;Man is still the first weapon of war.&quot;

==== Rank and role ====
The military organization is characterized by a command hierarchy divided by military rank, with ranks normally grouped (in descending order of authority) as officers (e.g. colonel), non-commissioned officers (e.g. sergeant), and personnel at the lowest rank (e.g. private). While senior officers make strategic decisions, subordinated military personnel (soldiers, sailors, marines, or airmen) fulfil them. Although rank titles vary by military branch and country, the rank hierarchy is common to all state armed forces worldwide.

In addition to their rank, personnel occupy one of many trade roles, which are often grouped according to the nature of the role&#x27;s military tasks on combat operations: combat roles (e.g. infantry), combat support roles (e.g. combat engineers), and combat service support roles (e.g. logistical support).

==== Recruitment ====
Personnel may be recruited or conscripted, depending on the system chosen by the state. Most military personnel are males; the minority proportion of female personnel varies internationally (approximately 3% in India, 10% in the UK, 13% in Sweden, 16% in the US, and 27% in South Africa). While two-thirds of states now recruit or conscript only adults, as of 2017 50 states still relied partly on children under the age of 18 (usually aged 16 or 17) to staff their armed forces.

Whereas recruits who join as officers tend to be upwardly-mobile, most enlisted personnel have a childhood background of relative socio-economic deprivation. For example, after the US suspended conscription in 1973, &quot;the military disproportionately attracted African American men, men from lower-status socioeconomic backgrounds, men who had been in nonacademic high school programs, and men whose high school grades tended to be low&quot;. However, a study released in 2020 on the socio-economic backgrounds of U.S. Armed Forces personnel suggests that they are at parity or slightly higher than the civilian population with respect to socio-economic indicators such as parental income, parental wealth and cognitive abilities. The study found that technological, tactical, operational and doctrinal changes have led to a change in the demand for personnel. Furthermore, the study suggests that the most disadvantaged socio-economic groups are less likely to meet the requirements of the modern U.S. military.

==== Obligations ====

The obligations of military employment are many. Full-time military employment normally requires a minimum period of service of several years; between two and six years is typical of armed forces in Australia, the UK and the US, for example, depending on role, branch, and rank. Some armed forces allow a short discharge window, normally during training, when recruits may leave the armed force as of right. Alternatively, part-time military employment, known as reserve service, allows a recruit to maintain a civilian job while training under military discipline at weekends; he or she may be called out to deploy on operations to supplement the full-time personnel complement. After leaving the armed forces, recruits may remain liable for compulsory return to full-time military employment in order to train or deploy on operations.

Military law introduces offences not recognized by civilian courts, such as absence without leave (AWOL), desertion, political acts, malingering, behaving disrespectfully, and disobedience (see, for example, offences against military law in the United Kingdom). Penalties range from a summary reprimand to imprisonment for several years following a court martial. Certain rights are also restricted or suspended, including the freedom of association (e.g. union organizing) and freedom of speech (speaking to the media). Military personnel in some countries have a right of conscientious objection if they believe an order is immoral or unlawful, or cannot in good conscience carry it out.

Personnel may be posted to bases in their home country or overseas, according to operational need, and may be deployed from those bases on exercises or operations. During peacetime, when military personnel are generally stationed in garrisons or other permanent military facilities, they conduct administrative tasks, training and education activities, technology maintenance, and recruitment.

==== Training ====
Initial training conditions recruits for the demands of military life, including preparedness to injure and kill other people, and to face mortal danger without fleeing. It is a physically and psychologically intensive process which resocializes recruits for the unique nature of military demands. For example:
* Individuality is suppressed (e.g. by shaving the head of new recruits, issuing uniforms, denying privacy, and prohibiting the use of first names);
* Daily routine is tightly controlled (e.g. recruits must make their beds, polish boots, and stack their clothes in a certain way, and mistakes are punished);
* Continuous stressors deplete psychological resistance to the demands of their instructors (e.g. depriving recruits of sleep, food, or shelter, shouting insults and giving orders intended to humiliate)
* Frequent punishments serve to condition group conformity and discourage poor performance;
* The disciplined drill instructor is presented as a role model of the ideal soldier.

===Intelligence===
The next requirement comes as a fairly basic need for the military to identify possible threats it may be called upon to face. For this purpose, some of the commanding forces and other military, as well as often civilian personnel participate in identification of these threats. This is at once an organization, a system and a process collectively called military intelligence (MI). Areas of study in Military intelligence may include the operational environment, hostile, friendly and neutral forces, the civilian population in an area of combat operations, and other broader areas of interest.

The difficulty in using military intelligence concepts and military intelligence methods is in the nature of the secrecy of the information they seek, and the clandestine nature that intelligence operatives work in obtaining what may be plans for a conflict escalation, initiation of combat, or an invasion.

An important part of the military intelligence role is the military analysis performed to assess military capability of potential future aggressors, and provide combat modelling that helps to understand factors on which comparison of forces can be made. This helps to quantify and qualify such statements as: &quot;China and India maintain the largest armed forces in the World&quot; or that &quot;the U.S. Military is considered to be the world&#x27;s strongest&quot;.
Although some groups engaged in combat, such as militants or resistance movements, refer to themselves using military terminology, notably &#x27;Army&#x27; or &#x27;Front&#x27;, none have had the structure of a national military to justify the reference, and usually have had to rely on support of outside national militaries. They also use these terms to conceal from the MI their true capabilities, and to impress potential ideological recruits.

Having military intelligence representatives participate in the execution of the national defence policy is important, because it becomes the first respondent and commentator on the policy expected strategic goal, compared to the realities of identified threats. When the intelligence reporting is compared to the policy, it becomes possible for the national leadership to consider allocating resources over and above the officers and their subordinates military pay, and the expense of maintaining military facilities and military support services for them.

===Budget===

Defense economics is the financial and monetary efforts made to resource and sustain militaries, and to finance military operations, including war.

The process of allocating resources is conducted by determining a military budget, which is administered by a military finance organization within the military. Military procurement is then authorized to purchase or contract provision of goods and services to the military, whether in peacetime at a permanent base, or in a combat zone from local population.

===Capability development===
Capability development, which is often referred to as the military &#x27;strength&#x27;, is arguably one of the most complex activities known to humanity; because it requires determining: strategic, operational, and tactical capability requirements to counter the identified threats; strategic, operational, and tactical doctrines by which the acquired capabilities will be used; identifying concepts, methods, and systems involved in executing the doctrines; creating design specifications for the manufacturers who would produce these in adequate quantity and quality for their use in combat; purchase the concepts, methods, and systems; create a forces structure that would use the concepts, methods, and systems most effectively and efficiently; integrate these concepts, methods, and systems into the force structure by providing military education, training, and practice that preferably resembles combat environment of intended use; create military logistics systems to allow continued and uninterrupted performance of military organizations under combat conditions, including provision of health services to the personnel, and maintenance for the equipment; the services to assist recovery of wounded personnel, and repair of damaged equipment; and finally, post-conflict demobilization, and disposal of war stocks surplus to peacetime requirements.

Development of military doctrine is perhaps the most important of all capability development activities, because it determines how military forces are used in conflicts, the concepts and methods used by the command to employ appropriately military skilled, armed and equipped personnel in achievement of the tangible goals and objectives of the war, campaign, battle, engagement, and action. The line between strategy and tactics is not easily blurred, although deciding which is being discussed had sometimes been a matter of personal judgement by some commentators, and military historians. The use of forces at the level of organization between strategic and tactical is called operational mobility.

===Science===

Because most of the concepts and methods used by the military, and many of its systems are not found in commercial branches, much of the material is researched, designed, developed, and offered for inclusion in arsenals by military science organizations within the overall structure of the military. Therefore, military scientists can be found interacting with all Arms and Services of the armed forces, and at all levels of the military hierarchy of command.

Although concerned with research into military psychology, particularly combat stress and how it affects troop morale, often the bulk of military science activities is directed at military intelligence technology, military communications, and improving military capability through research. The design, development, and prototyping of weapons, military support equipment, and military technology in general, is also an area in which much effort is invested – it includes everything from global communication networks and aircraft carriers to paint and food.

===Logistics===


Possessing military capability is not sufficient if this capability cannot be deployed for, and employed in combat operations. To achieve this, military logistics are used for the logistics management and logistics planning of the forces military supply chain management, the consumables, and capital equipment of the troops.

Although mostly concerned with the military transport, as a means of delivery using different modes of transport; from military trucks, to container ships operating from permanent military base, it also involves creating field supply dumps at the rear of the combat zone, and even forward supply points in a specific unit&#x27;s tactical area of responsibility.

These supply points are also used to provide military engineering services, such as the recovery of defective and derelict vehicles and weapons, maintenance of weapons in the field, the repair and field modification of weapons and equipment; and in peacetime, the life-extension programmes undertaken to allow continued use of equipment. One of the most important role of logistics is the supply of munitions as a primary type of consumable, their storage, and disposal.

==In combat==

The primary reason for the existence of the military is to engage in combat, should it be required to do so by the national defence policy, and to win. This represents an organisational goal of any military, and the primary focus for military thought through military history. How victory is achieved, and what shape it assumes, is studied by most, if not all, military groups on three levels.

===Strategic victory===


Military strategy is the management of forces in wars and military campaigns by a commander-in-chief, employing large military forces, either national and allied as a whole, or the component elements of armies, navies and air forces; such as army groups, naval fleets, and large numbers of aircraft. Military strategy is a long-term projection of belligerents&#x27; policy, with a broad view of outcome implications, including outside the concerns of military command. Military strategy is more concerned with the supply of war and planning, than management of field forces and combat between them. The scope of strategic military planning can span weeks, but is more often months or even years.
===Operational victory===

Operational mobility is, within warfare and military doctrine, the level of command which coordinates the minute details of tactics with the overarching goals of strategy. A common synonym is operational art.

The operational level is at a scale bigger than one where line of sight and the time of day are important, and smaller than the strategic level, where production and politics are considerations. Formations are of the operational level if they are able to conduct operations on their own, and are of sufficient size to be directly handled or have a significant impact at the strategic level. This concept was pioneered by the German army prior to and during the Second World War. At this level, planning and duration of activities takes from one week to a month, and are executed by Field Armies and Army Corps and their naval and air equivalents.

===Tactical victory===

Military tactics concerns itself with the methods for engaging and defeating the enemy in direct combat. Military tactics are usually used by units over hours or days, and are focused on the specific tasks and objectives of squadrons, companies, battalions, regiments, brigades, and divisions, and their naval and air force equivalents.

One of the oldest military publications is &quot;The Art of War&quot;, by the Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu. Written in the 6th century BCE, the 13-chapter book is intended as military instruction, and not as military theory, but has had a huge influence on Asian military doctrine, and from the late 19th century, on European and United States military planning. It has even been used to formulate business tactics, and can even be applied in social and political areas.

The Classical Greeks and the Romans wrote prolifically on military campaigning. Among the best-known Roman works are Julius Caesar&#x27;s commentaries on the Gallic Wars, and the Roman Civil war – written about 50 BC.

Two major works on tactics come from the late Roman period: &quot;Taktike Theoria&quot; by Aelianus Tacticus, and &quot;De Re Militari&quot; (&#x27;On military matters&#x27;) by Vegetius. &quot;Taktike Theoria&quot; examined Greek military tactics, and was most influential in the Byzantine world and during the Golden Age of Islam.

&quot;De Re Militari&quot; formed the basis of European military tactics until the late 17th century. Perhaps its most enduring maxim is &quot;Igitur qui desiderat pacem, praeparet bellum&quot; (let he who desires peace prepare for war).

Due to the changing nature of combat with the introduction of artillery in the European Middle Ages, and infantry firearms in the Renaissance, attempts were made to define and identify those strategies, grand tactics, and tactics that would produce a victory more often than that achieved by the Romans in praying to the gods before the battle.

Later this became known as military science, and later still, would adopt the scientific method approach to the conduct of military operations under the influence of the Industrial Revolution thinking. In his seminal book &quot;On War&quot;, the Prussian Major-General and leading expert on modern military strategy, Carl von Clausewitz defined military strategy as &#x27;the employment of battles to gain the end of war&#x27;. According to Clausewitz: 
strategy forms the plan of the War, and to this end it links together the series of acts which are to lead to the final decision, that is to say, it makes the plans for the separate campaigns and regulates the combats to be fought in each.

Hence, Clausewitz placed political aims above military goals, ensuring civilian control of the military. Military strategy was one of a triumvirate of &#x27;arts&#x27; or &#x27;sciences&#x27; that governed the conduct of warfare, the others being: military tactics, the execution of plans and manoeuvring of forces in battle, and maintenance of an army.

The meaning of military tactics has changed over time; from the deployment and manoeuvring of entire land armies on the fields of ancient battles, and galley fleets; to modern use of small unit ambushes, encirclements, bombardment attacks, frontal assaults, air assaults, hit-and-run tactics used mainly by guerrilla forces, and, in some cases, suicide attacks on land and at sea. Evolution of aerial warfare introduced its own air combat tactics. Often, military deception, in the form of military camouflage or misdirection using decoys, is used to confuse the enemy as a tactic.

A major development in infantry tactics came with the increased use of trench warfare in the 19th and 20th centuries. This was mainly employed in World War I in the Gallipoli campaign, and the Western Front. Trench warfare often turned to a stalemate, only broken by a large loss of life, because, in order to attack an enemy entrenchment, soldiers had to run through an exposed &#x27;no man&#x27;s land&#x27; under heavy fire from their opposing entrenched enemy.

==Technology==


As with any occupation, since ancient times, the military has been distinguished from other members of the society by their tools: the weapons and military equipment used in combat. When Stone Age humans first took flint to tip the spear, it was the first example of applying technology to improve the weapon. Since then, the advances made by human societies, and that of weapons, has been closely linked. Stone weapons gave way to Bronze Age and Iron Age weapons such as swords and shields. With each technological change was realized some tangible increase in military capability, such as through greater effectiveness of a sharper edge in defeating armour, or improved density of materials used in manufacture of weapons.

On land, the first significant technological advance in warfare was the development of ranged weapons, notably the sling and later the bow and arrow. The next significant advance came with the domestication of the horses and mastering of equestrianism, creating cavalry and allowing for faster military advances and better logistics. Possibly the most significant advancement was the wheel, a staple of transportation, starting with the chariot and eventually siege engines. The bow was manufactured in increasingly larger and more powerful versions to increase both the weapon range and armour penetration performance, developing into composite bows, recurve bows, longbows, and crossbows. These proved particularly useful during the rise of cavalry, as horsemen encased in ever-more sophisticated armour came to dominate the battlefield.

In medieval China, gunpowder had been invented, and was increasingly used by the military in combat. The use of gunpowder in the early vase-like mortars in Europe, and advanced versions of the longbow and crossbow with armour-piercing arrowheads, put an end to the dominance of the armoured knight. Gunpowder resulted in the development and fielding of the musket, which could be used effectively with little training. In time, the successors to muskets and cannons, in the form of rifles and artillery, would become core battlefield technology.As the speed of technological advances accelerated in civilian applications, so too did military and warfare become industrialized. The newly invented machine gun and repeating rifle redefined firepower on the battlefield, and, in part, explains the high casualty rates of the American Civil War and the decline of melee combat in warfare. The next breakthrough was the conversion of artillery parks from the muzzle-loading guns, to quicker breech-loading guns with recoiling barrels that allowed quicker aimed fire and use of a shield. The widespread introduction of low smoke (smokeless) propellant powders since the 1880s also allowed for a great improvement of artillery ranges. The development of breech loading had the greatest effect on naval warfare for the first time since the Middle Ages, altering the way weapons are mounted on warships. Naval tactics were divorced from the reliance on sails with the invention of the internal combustion. A further advance in military naval technology was the submarine and the torpedo.During World War I, the need to break the deadlock of trench warfare saw the rapid development of many new technologies, particularly tanks. Military aviation was extensively used, and bombers became decisive in many battles of World War II, which marked the most frantic period of weapons development in history. Many new designs, and concepts were used in combat, and all existing technologies of warfare were improved between 1939 and 1945.
During World War II, significant advances were made in military communications through increased use of radio, military intelligence through use of the radar, and in military medicine through use of penicillin, while in the air, the guided missile, jet aircraft, and helicopters were seen for the first time. Perhaps the most infamous of all military technologies was the creation of nuclear weapons, although the exact effects of its radiation were unknown until the early 1950s. Far greater use of military vehicles had finally eliminated the cavalry from the military force structure.
After World War II, with the onset of the Cold War, the constant technological development of new weapons was institutionalized, as participants engaged in a constant arms race in capability development. This constant state of weapons development continues into the present. Main battle tanks, and other heavy equipment such as armoured fighting vehicles, military aircraft, and ships, are characteristic to organized military forces.

The most significant technological developments that influenced combat have been guided missiles, which can be used by all branches of the armed services. More recently, information technology, and its use in surveillance, including space-based reconnaissance systems, have played an increasing role in military operations. The impact of information warfare, which focuses on attacking command communication systems, and military databases, has been coupled with the use of robotic systems in combat, such as unmanned combat aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles.

Recently, there has also been a particular focus towards the use of renewable fuels for running military vehicles on. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable fuels can be produced in any country, creating a strategic advantage. The U.S. military has committed itself to have 50% of its energy consumption come from alternative sources.

==As part of society==
For much of military history, the armed forces were considered to be for use by the heads of their societies, until recently, the crowned heads of states. In a democracy or other political system run in the public interest, it is a public force.

The relationship between the military and the society it serves is a complicated and ever-evolving one. Much depends on the nature of the society itself, and whether it sees the military as important, as for example in time of threat or war, or a burdensome expense typified by defence cuts in time of peace.

One difficult matter in the relation between military and society is control and transparency. In some countries, limited information on military operations and budgeting is accessible for the public. However, transparency in the military sector is crucial to fight corruption. This showed the Government Defence Anti-corruption Index Transparency International UK published in 2013.

Militaries often function as societies within societies, by having their own military communities, economies, education, medicine, and other aspects of a functioning civilian society. A military is not limited to nations in of itself, as many private military companies (or PMCs) can be used or hired by organizations and figures as security, escort, or other means of protection where police, agencies, or militaries are absent or not trusted.

===Ideology and ethics===
Militarist ideology is the society&#x27;s social attitude of being best served, or being a beneficiary of a government, or guided by concepts embodied in the military &quot;culture, doctrine, system&quot;, or &quot;leaders&quot;.

Either because of the cultural memory, national history, or the potentiality of a military threat, the militarist argument asserts that a civilian population is dependent upon, and thereby subservient to the needs and goals of its military for continued independence. Militarism is sometimes contrasted with the concepts of comprehensive national power, soft power and hard power.

Most nations have separate military laws which regulate conduct in war and during peacetime. An early exponent was Hugo Grotius, whose &quot;On the Law of War and Peace&quot; (1625) had a major impact of the humanitarian approach to warfare development. His theme was echoed by Gustavus Adolphus.

Ethics of warfare have developed since 1945, to create constraints on the military treatment of prisoners and civilians, primarily by the Geneva Conventions; but rarely apply to use of the military forces as internal security troops during times of political conflict that results in popular protests and incitement to popular uprising.

International protocols restrict the use, or have even created international bans on some types of weapons, notably weapons of mass destruction (WMD). International conventions define what constitutes a war crime, and provides for war crimes prosecution. Individual countries also have elaborate codes of military justice, an example being the United States&#x27; Uniform Code of Military Justice that can lead to court martial for military personnel found guilty of war crimes.

Military actions are sometimes argued to be justified by furthering a humanitarian cause, such as disaster relief operations to defend refugees; such actions are called military humanism.

<text>The Bronx Zoo (also historically the Bronx Zoological Park and the Bronx Zoological Gardens) is a zoo within Bronx Park in the Bronx, New York. It is one of the largest zoos in the United States by area and is the largest metropolitan zoo in the United States by area, comprising of park lands and naturalistic habitats separated by the Bronx River. On average, the zoo has 2.15 million visitors each year . The zoo&#x27;s original permanent buildings, known as Astor Court, were designed as a series of Beaux-Arts pavilions grouped around the large circular sea lion pool. The Rainey Memorial Gates were designed by sculptor Paul Manship in 1934 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

The zoo opened on November 8, 1899, featuring 843 animals in 22 exhibits. Its first director was William Temple Hornaday, who served as director for 30 years. From its inception the zoo has played a vital role in animal conservation. In 1905, the American Bison Society was created in an attempt to save the American bison, which had been depleted from tens-of-millions of animals to only a few hundred, from extinction. Two years later they were successfully reintroduced into the wild. In 2007, the zoo successfully reintroduced three Chinese alligators into the wild. The breeding was a milestone in the zoo&#x27;s 10-year effort to reintroduce the species to the Yangtze River in China.

Today, the Bronx Zoo is world-renowned for its large and diverse animal collection, and its award-winning exhibitions. The zoo is part of an integrated system of four zoos and one aquarium managed by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), and it is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).

==History==
===Early years===

In 1895, a group made up largely of members of the Boone and Crockett Club founded the New York Zoological Society (later renamed the Wildlife Conservation Society) for the purposes of founding a zoo, promoting the study of zoology, and preserving wildlife. Credit for this belonged chiefly to Club members Madison Grant and C. Grant LaFarge.

The zoo (sometimes called the Bronx Zoological Park and the Bronx Zoological Gardens) opened its doors to the public on November 8, 1899, featuring 843 animals in 22 exhibits. Its first director was William Temple Hornaday, who had 30 years of service at the zoo.

Heins &amp; LaFarge designed the original permanent buildings, known as Astor Court, as a series of Beaux-Arts pavilions grouped around the large circular sea lion pool. In 1934, the Rainey Memorial Gates, designed by sculptor Paul Manship, were dedicated as a memorial to noted big game hunter Paul James Rainey. The gates were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

The Rockefeller Fountain, which today adorns the gardens just inside the Fordham Road Gate, was once a landmark in Como, Italy. Originally built by Biagio Catella in 1872, it stood in the main square (Piazza Cavour) by the lakeside. Bought by William Rockefeller in 1902 for lire 3,500 (the estimated equivalent then of $637, and today of around $17,600), it was installed at the zoo in 1903. In 1968, the fountain was designated an official New York City landmark, and is one of the few local monuments to be honored in this way.

The New York Zoological Society&#x27;s seal was designed by famed wildlife-artist Charles R. Knight. It depicted a ram&#x27;s head and an eagle to reflect the society&#x27;s interest in preserving North American wildlife. While no longer in use, the seal can still be found on the lawn in the center of Astor Court.
On December 17, 1902, the zoo became one of the seven zoos outside of Australia, and one of only two in the United States, to ever hold the now-extinct thylacine. The first was a male obtained from German animal dealer Carl Hagenbeck. It died on August 15, 1908. The zoo received a second male on January 26, 1912, from the Beaumaris Zoo in Tasmania, who later died on November 20 of that year. The zoo received its final two animals from Sydney animal dealer Ellis S. Joseph. The first was an unsexed individual who arrived on November 7, 1916, in poor condition and died seven days later. The second and final animal was a female purchased from the Beaumaris Zoo by Joseph for £25 (~$35) and then was resold to the zoo, arriving on July 14, 1917. On a visit, the director of the Melbourne Zoo, Mr. Le Souef, said upon seeing the animal:
The thylacine died on September 13, 1919.

In early 1903, the zoo was gifted a pair of Barbary lions, a subspecies which is extinct in the wild. The female was named Bedouin Maid and male Sultan, who went on to become one of the zoo&#x27;s most popular animals. Displayed in the Lion House, Sultan was four years old at the time and described as being both &quot;a perfect specimen&quot; and &quot;unusually good tempered&quot;. In May 1903, the pair produced three cubs, the first to be born at the zoo. On October 7, 1905, Charles R. Knight painted a portrait of Sultan and the animal went on to be the focus of many of the zoo&#x27;s postcards. Sultan was also the model for the lion which sits atop the Rainey Memorial Gates.

In 1906, the Bronx Zoo put Ota Benga, a young Mbuti man from the Congo, on display along with monkeys and a bow and arrow. He was never returned home and later died of suicide at age 33. 

In 1916, the zoo built the world&#x27;s first animal hospital located at a zoo.

In 1926, the Bronx Zoo and the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Zoological Park simultaneously became the first in the country to exhibit shoebills.

The same year, W. Douglas Burden, F. J. Defosse, and Emmett Reid Dunn collected two live adult Komodo dragons—the first in America—for the zoo.

In 1937, the zoo became the first in North America to exhibit okapi.

===Recent years===
In 1960, the zoo became the first in the world to keep a James&#x27;s flamingo, a species which had been thought to be extinct until 1957. They were imported along with the similar Andean flamingo.

The zoo was one of the few in the world to exhibit proboscis monkeys outside of Southeast Asia and, in the 1976 &quot;International Zoo Yearbook&quot;, the zoo reported having eight monkeys, seven of which were born at the zoo. As of March 1999, it only had two monkeys left, these two being the last members of their species kept in the United States. In 2003, the pair were sent to the Singapore Zoo.

On June 6, 1990, the zoo received a female Sumatran rhinoceros named Rapunzel. At the time, the zoo was one of only three in North America to hold the critically endangered species, with the Cincinnati and San Diego Zoos being the others, holding one female each. The three institutions were a part of the Sumatran Rhino Trust&#x27;s plan to start a captive breeding program for the species. Rapunzel was born in the wild in Sumatra and rescued from an area of rainforest that was slated to be cleared for a palm oil plantation in 1989. Though it&#x27;s believed she bred in the wild, she never produced any calves in captivity. It was eventually determined that she was past reproductive age, at which point she was returned to the zoo in 2000, having been brought out for breeding purposes. She lived in the Zoo Center until her death in December 2005 in her 30s.

In November 2006, the zoo opened up brand-new eco-friendly restrooms outside the Bronx River Gate. According to Clivus Multrum, which built the composting toilets chosen by the zoo, these facilities can serve 500,000 people and save of water a year.

In March 2007, the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Fordham University Graduate School of Education announced they would offer a joint program leading to a Master of Science degree in education and New York State initial teacher certification in adolescent science education (biology, grades 7–12). The program began the next year, and is the first joint degree program of its kind.
In 2009, New York City cut funding for the state&#x27;s 76 zoos, aquariums, and botanical gardens. The Wildlife Conservation Society as a whole suffered a $15-million deficit, and the zoo was forced to downsize its staff and animal collection. The budget cuts forced the buyouts of over 100 employees and layoffs of dozens more as well as the closure of four sections of the zoo: World of Darkness, Rare Animal Range, the Skyfari, and a small section of the overall still-open African Plains exhibit which featured endangered antelope. In the end, 186 staff positions (15%) were cut within the WCS. In 2012, Mayor Michael Bloomberg passed another budget cut that took $4.7-million from the funding of the zoo and the New York Aquarium, also run by the WCS. This cut represented more than half of what the collections were receiving. However, Bloomberg also passed an energy subsidy that brought the cuts down to $3.7-million.

In the summer of 2014, New York Representative Carolyn B. Maloney visited the Chengdu Panda Base in Sichuan, China and announced her plan to bring giant pandas to New York City. Initially, she aimed to exhibit them at the Central Park Zoo, though switched her attention to the Bronx after deciding the 6.5-acre zoo didn&#x27;t have the resources to care for the animals. Maloney and her supporters, which included Maurice R. Greenberg, Newt Gingrich, and John A. Catsimatidis, were met with many obstacles throughout their campaign. Initially, the largest issues were the lack of support from Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Hall, and Chinese officials insisting that no more pandas be brought to the United States. However, in October 2015, Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai announced that his country was willing to enter preliminary talks with the city over the matter, and soon after de Blasio and City Hall signed a letter appealing to Chinese officials, drafted by Maloney in 2014. Despite her efforts, Maloney&#x27;s campaign still has yet to overcome two critical steps in acquiring pandas: funding and the zoo&#x27;s consent. Both de Blasio and the Wildlife Conservation Society refuse to fund the project, not wanting taxpayer or vital zoo money to go towards the highly expensive project. David Towne, chairman of the American-based Giant Panda Conservation Foundation, estimated that the cost of bringing pandas to the city would be around $50 million.

The foundation has also said that the cost of keeping just one such animal is about $1 million a year, including food, trainers, and habitat upkeep. Additionally, China loans out their pandas for a hefty fee. A study published by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2005 found that the four U.S. zoos holding pandas—the Memphis Zoo, the San Diego Zoo, the National Zoological Park (located in Washington, D.C., and Front Royal, Virginia) and Zoo Atlanta—had spent $33 million more on their animals than revenue made off of them between 2000 and 2003. Despite the figures, Maloney believes pandas in her city will do better since the city has a higher population than those four cities combined, and received a record-breaking 56.4-million visitors in 2014. Still, the WCS continues to steer away from bringing in these pandas. In 2014, a senior official from the WCS said Maloney&#x27;s campaign had reached &quot;a new level of absurdity&quot; when it was announced she intended to bring a Chinese delegation to the Central Park Zoo. In November 2015, Jim Breheny, WCS Executive Vice President and Bronx Zoo Director, released a statement saying:
==Exhibits and attractions==
The zoo has two types of displays: free exhibits accessible with a General Admission ticket, and premium exhibits which require additional fees.

===Free exhibits and attractions===
, the Bronx Zoo is home to more than 4,000 animals of 650 species, many of which are endangered or threatened. Some of its exhibits, such as World of Birds and World of Reptiles, are arranged by taxonomy, while others, such as African Plains and the Wild Asian Monorail, are arranged geographically. The zoo also has Indian peafowl that roam freely.

====Astor Court====

Astor Court is an old section of the zoo that is home to many of the zoo&#x27;s original buildings, designed by Heins &amp; LaFarge. While most of the buildings are closed to the public, the former Lion House was reopened as the &quot;Madagascar!&quot; exhibit in 2008, and the Zoo Center still exhibits various species. Astor Court includes the historic sea lion pool featuring California sea lions and northern fur seals as a reference to the Paris Zoo. Small aviaries featuring small bird species can be found nearby and white-headed capuchins can be seen behind the old Monkey House.

The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated Astor Court&#x27;s buildings as a city landmark in 2000, after a failed attempt to do so in 1966.

====African Plains====

African Plains allows visitors to walk past lions, African wild dogs, Grévy&#x27;s zebras, and spotted hyenas, and see herds of nyalas, Thomson’s gazelles, and slender-horned gazelles, It also includes hybrid giraffes (Baringo × reticulated giraffe) sharing their homes with common ostriches. The exhibit originally opened in 1941 and was the first in the country to allow visitors to view predators and their prey in a naturalistic setting as well as allowing large predators such as lions to be exhibited cage-free. This success was achieved through the creation of a series of deep moats, a set-up which can still be found at the zoo today. The wild dogs, however, can be viewed close-up from a glass-fronted viewing pavilion. The zoo has bred their lions on multiple occasions, including one male and two females born in January 2010 and three males and one female born in August 2013. The zoo, in partnership with the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;, held a contest to name the 2010 cubs, which made their public debut in April 2010. The winning names were Shani, Nala, and Adamma. The 2013 cubs were named Thulani, Ime, Bahata, and Amara and the three males can still be found on-exhibit at the zoo.

The Carter Giraffe Building, a section of African Plains, features indoor/outdoor viewing of the zoo&#x27;s giraffes and South African ostriches, and is also home to common dwarf mongooses, Von der Decken&#x27;s hornbills, and northern white-faced owls. In June 2009, two aardvarks imported from Tanzania joined the exhibit. In September 2010, the pair gave birth to a male named Hoover, the first to ever be born at the zoo.

Until 2009, the southwestern corner of African Plains was home to the endangered Arabian oryx and blesbok. Due to budget cuts and the unpopularity of the species with visitors, they were phased-out of the collection. This section of the exhibit is replaced by the Nature Trek. In 2017 they received two baby cheetahs from the San Diego Zoo. Cheetahs are now part of their animal encounter programs. They were replaced by the hyenas.
====Big Bears====
Big Bears features four bears, a male grizzly bear and three ABC Islands bears rescued as orphans from Baranof Island of Alaska.

Until 2015, two female grizzly bears named Betty and Veronica also lived in this exhibit, but moved to the Central Park Zoo where they died in 2020 and 2021.

The zoo also formerly housed polar bears until the last individual, a 26-year-old male named Tundra died in December 2017. Three dholes from the San Diego Zoo Safari Park were added to the habitat in 2019.

====Gelada Reserve====

Gelada Reserve, originally called Baboon Reserve, opened in 1990. It is a two-acre recreation of the Ethiopian highlands which, at the time of its opening, was the largest primate exhibit in the United States. The exhibit&#x27;s main features revolve around the zoo&#x27;s troop of geladas such as artificial rocks and earthbanks, and displays about life in the highlands and the side-by-side evolution of humans and geladas. Visitors can watch the geladas from multiple viewpoints along with Nubian ibex and rock hyrax, all of which are mixed together in the hilly enclosure. An African village-styled café overlooks the exhibit. Baboon Reserve won the AZA Exhibit Award in 1991. In the fall of 2014, a male gelada was born at the zoo, the first in over 13 years, and was the only zoo in the US to display them until the San Diego Zoo in 2017 received their gelada troop for their Africa Rocks exhibit.

Before the late 1980s, this place replaced a lawn of aoudads.

====Himalayan Highlands====
Himalayan Highlands, which opened on June 27, 1986, recreates the Himalayas region of Asia. The exhibit is known for its highly naturalistic look and use of the hilly and rocky terrain found in that portion of the zoo. The stars of the exhibit are the zoo&#x27;s multiple snow leopards. The exhibit also is home to red pandas and white-naped cranes. In 2006, the zoo brought in a male snow leopard named Leo from Pakistan after he was orphaned at around two months old. Leo sired a male cub on April 9, 2013. The cub is one of more than 70 snow leopards born at the zoo, which was the first U.S. zoo to exhibit the species in 1903. Leo later became a grandfather when his son sired a female cub in 2017.

====Madagascar!====

Madagascar!, which opened on June 20, 2008, recreates various habitats found on the island of Madagascar and contains a variety of wildlife from the island, including lemurs, lesser hedgehog tenrecs, fossas, Nile crocodiles, radiated tortoises, greater vasa parrots and highly endangered cichlids. Ring-tailed lemurs, collared lemurs, red ruffed lemurs, crowned lemurs, and Coquerel&#x27;s sifakas are the lemur species held in the exhibit. Madagascar! holds the first two ring-tailed mongoose in the United States and is home to over 100,000 Madagascar hissing cockroaches that can be named for $10 around Valentine&#x27;s Day. The exhibit has multiple educational displays focusing on the many threats to the survival of these species as well as the WCS&#x27;s conservation work in Madagascar. The building was converted from the former Lion House, which had opened in 1903 and closed by the late 1980s. The exhibit also has tomato frogs and Henkel&#x27;s leaf-tailed geckos.

====Mouse House====
The Mouse House is a small building home to various species of small mammals, particularly rodents. The building features both diurnal and nocturnal areas and a row of outdoor cages which, during the summer months, are home to a variety of small primates, many of which are former monkey house inhabitants. Species include black and rufous elephant shrews, eastern spiny mice, harvest mice, Brazilian agoutis, northern Luzon giant cloud rats, Mohol bushbabies, Damaraland mole-rats, long-tailed chinchillas, and feathertail gliders.

====Aquatic Bird House====

The current Aquatic Bird House opened on September 24, 1964, on the foundation of the original house, which was opened on November 8, 1899, with the rest of the zoo. The building features a multitude of mostly open-fronted enclosures mainly focusing on coastal and wetland habitats and the species that rely on them. Scarlet ibises, roseate spoonbills, anhingas, boat-billed herons and Madagascar crested ibises are among the residents here. The exhibit also features an outdoor pond home to a flock of American flamingos and a large aviary home to greater and lesser adjutants.

The zoo is one of only three zoos in North America working with the endangered storks and has bred them several times, including the hatching of two chicks on June 27 and August 15, 2015. The Aquatic Bird House is also home to another endangered stork species: the Storm&#x27;s stork. The zoo is one of only two in the United States working with this species; the other being the San Diego Zoo. In May 2014, the zoo opened a new nocturnal enclosure for a North Island brown kiwi in the building, and in May 2015, a colony of Australian little penguins from the Taronga Zoo were added.

====Russell B. Aitken Sea Bird Aviary====

The Russell B. Aitken Sea Bird Aviary, which opened on May 17, 1997, is a huge walk-through aviary designed to resemble the Patagonian coast. The aviary stands at 60-feet high, occupies 615,000 cubic feet, is supported by five steel arches, and netted with a stainless steel mesh. The aviary was built to replace the original De Jur Aviary that opened with the zoo in 1899 and collapsed in a snowstorm in February 1995. The exhibit&#x27;s height and open space allows the residents to soar around above visitor&#x27;s heads and the fake sea cliff walls allows for more natural nesting and roosting behavior. The aviary is home to about 100 birds, most being Inca terns, but also a small colony of Magellanic penguins, grey gulls, and brown pelicans. The aviary was also home to the last guanay cormorant in captivity outside of South America. In April 2014, four Peruvian pelicans were added to the exhibit, and in January 2015, a pair of ruddy-headed geese were added.

====Tiger Mountain====

Tiger Mountain, which opened on May 15, 2003, is a three-acre exhibit which features Amur tigers and occasionally Malayan tigers, who are usually kept off-exhibit. The exhibit has two enclosures with glass viewing, the second of which has a 10,000 gallon pool with underwater viewing. Outside of the tigers, the exhibit has multiple interactive displays designed to educate visitors on behavioral enrichment and on the zoo&#x27;s/WCS&#x27; ex-situ and in-situ conservation.

The exhibit won the AZA Exhibit Award in 2004. The zoo has had good breeding successful with both subspecies of tiger, having bred both in 2010. Another set of Siberian tiger cubs were born in 2012, and a pair of Malayan tiger cubs were born in 2016. One of the tiger cubs named Nadia tested positive for COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, but have since recovered from the disease. Across from the entrance to Tiger Mountain, a large herd of Père David&#x27;s deer and a pair of whooper swans can be found.

Before 2003, this part of the area was once Wolf Wood, and includes a pack of wolves.

====World of Birds====

World of Birds, which originally opened in 1972, is an indoor bird house spanning two floors and featuring several walk-through aviaries. The building closed for repairs and upgrades in the summer of 2010, and reopened the following year. The exhibit has multiple educational displays focusing on deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade and their affects on wild bird populations. The most prominent residents of the exhibit include the maleos, a pair of knobbed hornbills, Andean cock-of-the-rocks, Nicobar pigeons, southern bald ibises, ocellated turkeys, Cuban amazons, and white-throated bee-eaters. Emus can be found in an outdoor yard. In mid-2009, the zoo&#x27;s hand-reared pair of great blue turacos successfully raised chicks, the first known instance of a hand-reared pair doing so. In March 2013, three maleo chicks hatched at the zoo, bringing their total number of birds to 12. The zoo, along with the WCS, works toward preserving this species in the wild as well.

====World of Reptiles====
World of Reptiles has been an attraction at the zoo since it first opened. The building&#x27;s first curator was Raymond Lee Ditmars, who had kept 45 snakes in his attic before being hired at the zoo. The exhibit is a long hall with various terrariums situated on both sides. The exhibit also features a nursery area, which exhibits newborn herptiles born at the zoo, as well as a window into the off-show breeding and caring facilities. In the building, the zoo breeds and exhibits a wide range of species, including Chinese alligators, blue iguanas, Cuban crocodiles, false gharials, dyeing poison dart frogs, eyelash vipers, Fly River turtles, giant musk turtles, green anacondas, hellbenders, Milos viper, king cobras and Philippine sailfin lizards. The building also is home to the zoo&#x27;s breeding population of Kihansi spray toads, which the zoo saved from extinction. On March 25, 2011, an Egyptian cobra escaped from its off-show enclosure, during which time the exhibit was closed to the public. Six days later, the animal was found elsewhere in the building. The zoo named the cobra MIA (Missing In Action) and placed it on exhibit.

====Pheasant Aviary====

The Pheasant Aviary is a long row of cages home to a large variety of bird species, particularly pheasants. Exhibited species include Elliot&#x27;s pheasant, Lady Amherst&#x27;s pheasant, Cabot&#x27;s tragopan, blue eared-pheasant, mountain peacock-pheasant, Mérida helmeted curassow, Swinhoe&#x27;s pheasant, Java peafowl, eastern loggerhead shrike (&quot;Lanius ludovicianus migrans&quot;), white-throated ground-dove, Lord Derby&#x27;s parakeet, Montezuma oropendola and yellow-crested cockatoo.

====Birds of Prey====
Birds of Prey is a row of cages for multiple raptor species. The exhibit is home to bald eagles, golden eagles, burrowing owls, snowy owls, Andean condors, palm nut vultures and king vultures. In February 2011, the zoo received two bald eagles rescued in Wyoming. Nearby is a small pond for black-necked swans, American white pelicans and brown pelicans.

====Zoo Center====

The Zoo Center, built in 1908, is a one-story Beaux-Arts building located in Astor Court. The exhibit houses blue tree monitors, Mertens&#x27; water monitors and spiny-tailed monitors indoors and has both indoor and outdoor enclosures for Komodo dragons, Aldabra giant tortoises and southern white rhinoceros. The building&#x27;s animal frieze was carved by A. P. Proctor. In 2000, the building was landmarked. The building is east of the Children&#x27;s Zoo and south of Madagascar!.

The building was originally designed as the zoo&#x27;s Elephant House and has held all three elephant species over its history. The building has also been home to various rhinoceros species, hippopotamus, Bactrian camel, Malayan tapir and North Sulawesi babirusa. The building also held Rapunzel, one of the few Sumatran rhinos held in U.S. zoos, until her death in 2005.

====Bison Range====
The Bison Range is in the northeast corner of the zoo, and has been a feature of the zoo since its opening, having been only renovated since 1971. The range initially served to breed Plains bison, who were in danger of becoming extinct in the United States. The exhibit is one of the few large herds of bison in U.S. zoos. In 1913, at the behest of the American Bison Society, fourteen bison were transported from the range to Montana&#x27;s National Bison Range, as well as to Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota.

====Mitsubishi Riverwalk====
The Mitsubishi Riverwalk is a path that curves around the Bronx River, on the opposite bank from the zoo. It opened in 2004 upon the completion of a cleanup project on the river. The walkway was funded by Mitsubishi International Corporation Foundation and protects of Bronx River watershed.

===Paid exhibits and attractions===
One admission to a premium exhibit costs between $12 and 14 per person per exhibit if paid separately. The fee for unlimited admission grants the ticket holder free access to all attractions for that day. Family memberships include full access.

There are nine premium exhibit attractions:
*Bug Carousel
*Butterfly Garden
*Children&#x27;s Zoo
*Congo Gorilla Forest
*JungleWorld
*Wild Asia Monorail
*Zoo Shuttle
*Nature Trek

The Treetop Adventure Climb and Zipline requires a different fee and is not part of the admission fee online. Thus, it is not included in the park ticket or in any membership.

====Budgie Landing====
Budgie Landing is an exhibit featuring of 1,000 budgerigars which opened on May 27, 2023. Unlike premium attractions and exhibits, Budgie Landing requires all visitors pay a small entrance fee ($5 for regular guests and $3 for members). A complementary feeding stick is handed out with admission.

====Bug Carousel====
The Bug Carousel has seats shaped like insects. Installed in 2005, it has an annual ridership of 540,000 as of 2014.

====Butterfly Garden====

This permanent structure is an indoor butterfly conservatory which lets visitors walk through gardens and meadows and watch the butterflies up close.
 Built and inaugurated in mid-1996, the attraction is a 170-foot-long maze, where &quot;visitors can walk through the stages of a monarch&#x27;s metamorphosis&quot; with a greenhouse in the middle hosting 44 species and over 1,000 butterflies; the greenhouse is really &quot;a plastic tent on an aluminum frame&quot;.

The structure, costing $500,000, is the precursor for a future permanent House of Invertebrates in the Monkey House near the Fordham Road entrance. Many species come from the New York metropolitan area, and all species of butterflies and moths are from around the continent.
If not successful, the Oklahoma City Zoo would have purchased it in September 1997.

Before the Butterfly Garden opened, this was where the Great Ape House was located, and it was once home to gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, and gibbons through the exhibit’s history.

====Children&#x27;s Zoo====
The original Children&#x27;s Zoo in the Bronx Zoo opened in 1941 with a nursery-rhyme theme; in 1981, a new Children&#x27;s Zoo opened, and was instantly successful, seeing almost 250,000 visitors in two months. It closed for renovations in 2013; it reopened on May 30, 2015, with new exhibits featuring giant anteaters, common degus, Patagonian maras, white-nosed coatis, Hoffmann&#x27;s two-toed sloths, squirrel monkeys, American flamingos, Asian small-clawed otters, North American porcupines, great horned owls, striped skunks, prairie dogs, fennec foxes, African spurred tortoises, Nubian goats, zebus, alpacas, sheep, donkeys, chickens, ducks, pigs, geese, and domestic turkeys.

====Congo Gorilla Forest====
In the southwestern part of the zoo, Congo Gorilla Forest is a rainforest that is home to the 20 or so western lowland gorillas in the zoo. Angolan colobus, Wolf&#x27;s guenons, pygmy marmosets, mandrills, okapis, red river hogs, an ornate monitor, and an African rock python also call this area home. It also includes a bird exhibit that houses white-crested hornbills, Congo peafowls, and African pygmy geese.

The Congo Gorilla Forest was opened in 1999 and was visited 7,000,000 times . In one of the largest breeding groups of western lowland gorillas in North America, the exhibit has two troops of gorillas, for a total of 19 gorillas. Since 1999, 14 gorillas, 23 red river hogs, 11 Wolf&#x27;s guenons, and four okapis have been born in the exhibit. There is also an 8-minute film in the middle of the exhibit, as well as viewing points throughout. In total, there are about 400 animals from 55 species. Over $10.6 million for conservation of Central African habitats has been collected in donations since the exhibit&#x27;s opening, and the exhibit has netted $12.5 million in exhibit fees .

Before the Congo Gorilla Forest was constructed, this site was once South America, and it is known to house pygmy hippopotamuses, tapirs, giant anteaters, Patagonian maras, guanacos, greater rheas, babirusas, brocket deer, and peccaries.

====JungleWorld====
This exhibit is an indoor tropical jungle and home to nearly 800 species including Asian small-clawed otters, Javan lutungs, silvery lutungs, northern white-cheeked gibbons, Matschie&#x27;s tree-kangaroos, gharials, northern Luzon giant cloud rats, greater mouse deer, Malayan tapirs, and lesser adjutants living in mangroves and on the beaches. Visitors can watch the gibbons swinging or singing and watch the otters play. The exhibit includes species that are usually on the jungle floor including stag beetles, scorpions and fire-bellied toads, but behind glass. A pond with a waterfall lets visitors sit and observe gourami and Fly River turtles.

Planning for JungleWorld, in the southeastern Wild Asia portion of the zoo, was started in 1977 and completed at a cost of $9.5 million in June 1985. $4.1 million in funds were donated by Enid A. Haupt, a member of the New York Zoological Society&#x27;s board of trustees. The building is the largest at the zoo with an area of and a height of . There is a wooden path that meanders for .

The building&#x27;s design integrates its environment with the path, as no bars are present in the building; the walkway has no full-height barriers and short railings; and only by means of ravines, streams, or cliffs are most of the animals separated from people and each other. There is a volcanic scrub forest, a mangrove swamp, a lowland evergreen rain forest with giant trees which merges into a mountain rain forest and five museum-like galleries connecting and explaining the habitats. The building was built to emphasize the fact that of rainforest is lost every minute.

====Wild Asia Monorail====
The monorail was inaugurated in 1977 with the rest of the formerly underdeveloped Wild Asia section of the zoo. There are six 9-car monorails on this ride, originally built by Rohr; the ride was refurbished in 2007. Some animals in the zoo can only be seen on this ride such as tigers, Przewalski&#x27;s horses, Indian rhinoceros, Indian elephants, red pandas, and a plethora of even-toed ungulates such as axis deer, barasingha, blackbuck, Bactrian deer, gaurs, brow-antlered deer, babirusas, sambar deer, nilgai, red muntjacs, Indian hog deer, Formosan sika deer, tufted deer, Himalayan tahrs, and markhors.

This ride takes visitors through a area that recreates the mud wallows and pastures, forests and riverbanks of Asia. Visitors will see tigers, Indian elephants, rhinos and wild horses in their natural habitats. As the monorail travels along the Bronx River, visitors can see native animals including egrets, turtles, and ducks. The monorail is accessible for wheelchairs up to 26 inches (66 cm) wide. Smaller chairs are available at the monorail platform for visitors with wider wheelchairs or motorized scooters.

====Nature Trek====
Nature Trek opened on July 1, 2017, in the southeast portion of the park near Wild Asia. It consists of twelve covered rope bridges connecting small porches on the sides of towers. There are also elevated tunnels and a large overlook, as well as several small challenges resembling &quot;American Ninja Warrior&quot; obstacles. On the ground is a play area with a sandbox, water sprinklers and structures, and branches. Nature Trek is partially wheelchair-accessible and contains ramps of varying difficulties. This attraction discourages visitors who are wearing footwear such as flip-flops; high heels are prohibited. As part of a push for environmental sustainability, some parts of the attraction are made of black locust, and the structures use existing trees within the forest.

====Bronx Zoo Treetop Adventure====
The Treetop Adventure section opened on July 7, 2017, in the northeast portion of the park near Bronx River Parking. It consists of seven different levels of rope courses: two each of beginner, intermediate, and advanced, and one expert course. There is also a zip-line course traversing the Bronx River in both directions. The attraction also contains rope and swinging bridges, ladders and rolling and swinging objects. Separate from the rest of the zoo, it charges its own entry fee; the fee is only applied to those who are climbing on the objects or using the zip-line. Open year-round, the attraction prohibits riders who are less than 7 years old and less than , or more than .

====Dinosaur Safari====
Dinosaur Safari takes visitors on a safari ride through a normally off-exhibit 2-acre wooded area and features animatronic dinosaurs from throughout time, starting at 300-million-years ago in the Permian Period and ending 235-million-years later in the Cretaceous Period. The ride lasts approximately 20 minutes. The &quot;robo-saurs&quot; are manufactured by Billings Productions, who lease them out to sites all over the world. The exhibit features more popular species such as the &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, &quot;Triceratops&quot;, &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;, as well as less well-known species such as the &quot;Pachycephalosaurus&quot;, &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; and &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;. The ride&#x27;s &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; spit water at visitors as a nod to the species&#x27; acid-spitting abilities in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; film and Michael Crichton&#x27;s novel, even though there is no reason to believe the living animal did so. The exhibit originally ran through the summers of 2013 and 2014 and returned for the 2019 season.

===Former exhibits===
====World of Darkness====
World of Darkness opened in 1969 and was the world&#x27;s first major exhibit designed specifically to introduce the public to nocturnal animals such as the Chinese leopard cat (&quot;Prionailurus bengalensis chinensis&quot;), naked mole-rats, bay duiker, Pallas&#x27;s long-tongued bat, spiny mouse, lesser mouse lemur, small spotted genet, lesser spear-nosed bats, spotted skunk, fat-tailed lemurs Jamaican fruit bat, Mohol bushbaby, cloud rat, Hoffman&#x27;s two-toed sloth, rock cavy, pygmy slow loris, short-tailed bats, striped skunk, grey-legged night monkey, sand cat, Rodriguez flying fox, brush-tailed porcupine, broad-snouted caiman, sand boa, and marine toad. Built by Morris Ketchum Jr. &amp; Associates, the house was built where the zoo&#x27;s Rocking Stone Restaurant stood until 1942. The exhibit used red-lights to dimly illuminate the enclosures within the windowless building. Like all nocturnal exhibits, the house ran on a reversed lighting schedule, which simulated night and day at opposite times to allow visitors to view nocturnal animals in a more naturalistic setting. Due to budget cuts and the high cost of running the exhibit, it was closed in 2009. On November 28, 2024, during the 98th Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, the zoo ran a float that hinted at the return of the exhibit. This was later confirmed on December 4 when the zoo announced that the exhibit would return in summer 2025 featuring caiman, fruit bats, Hoffmann&#x27;s two-toed sloth, and aye-aye.

====Rare Animal Range====
Rare Animal Range was a trail which focused on highly endangered species. Featured species included guanaco, Formosan sika deer, pied ruffed lemurs and blue-eyed black lemurs. The exhibit also had duplicate enclosures for the zoo&#x27;s Arabian oryx, blesbok, Père David&#x27;s deer and broad-snouted caiman as well as a large pond with a pair of small islands in the center which were home to a pair of golden-cheeked gibbons. They had the Big Birds exhibits, which were lawns for ostriches, emus, rheas, and cassowaries. Due to budget cuts and the unpopularity of many of the species, the zoo was forced to close the exhibit in 2009.

While most of the species left the zoo when the exhibit closed, the Formosan sika deer were moved to the Wild Asia Monorail and the Père David&#x27;s deer remained in their primary enclosure across from Tiger Mountain while the blue-eyed black lemurs were moved to Madagascar! where they are rotated with the Coquerel&#x27;s sifakas. While no longer at the zoo, pied ruffed lemurs can still be seen at the zoo&#x27;s partner institute, the Central Park Zoo. The zoo&#x27;s popular Dinosaur Safari ran through a part of this area and the zoo&#x27;s yearly Run for the Wild event runs through its entirety.

On April 20, 2024, the Animal Chronicles opened in honor of the 125th Anniversary of the Bronx Zoo. it features 13 scenes of 68 animal eco-sculptures that showcase key achievements in the zoo’s 125 year history of saving animal species and connecting visitors to wildlife.

====Skyfari====

The Skyfari was a popular gondola lift which transported visitors from the Zoo Center to the Asian Plaza, running over African Plains and several other popular exhibits at the zoo. The seasonal exhibit ran from April to October and rose feet in the air. With around 490,000 riders annually, the lift was the zoo&#x27;s third most popular attraction after Congo Gorilla Forest and the Wild Asia Monorail. Despite its popularity, ticket sales for it were barely breaking-even and maintenance costs led to a loss of profit. On July 8, 2008, high winds and heat led to one of the cars derailing, which trapped thirty-six passengers for up to five hours. Due to this, along with heavy budget cuts, the ride was permanently closed in January 2009, after 35 years of operation.

====Monkey House====
The Monkey House, which first opened in 1901 and was originally named the Primate House, closed in late February 2012 after 111 years of operation. At the time of closing, it was home to cotton-top tamarins, white-faced sakis, Wied&#x27;s marmosets, moustached tamarins, black-chinned emperor tamarins, Goeldi&#x27;s monkeys and grey-handed night-monkeys, as well as Brazilian porcupines and Pallas&#x27;s long-tongued bats. This was the building where Ota Benga spent most of his time during his stay at the zoo.

Some of the primates that were in the now-closed exhibit have been moved to other parts of the zoo, such as the cotton-top tamarins now being found in World of Birds; others were sent to other New York City zoos, such as the sakis being moved to the Central Park Zoo. White-headed capuchins can still be seen in an outdoor cage behind the building.

====Amazing Amphibians====
Amazing Amphibians was a short-lived exhibition which opened in the zoo&#x27;s Zoo Center in June 2008 and only remained for a few years. The exhibit featured several educational displays on amphibian conservation as well as a few terrariums containing several amphibian species. Highlight species included Chacoan horned frog, Puerto Rican crested toad, smooth-sided toad and common mudpuppy.

While none of these species are currently on-exhibit at the zoo, the Puerto Rican crested toads can be seen at the Central Park Zoo, which breeds this species for reintroduction back into Puerto Rico.

====4-D Theater====
The 4-D Theater showed 4-D films with the help of 3-D film and built-in sensory effects, including moving seats, wind, mist, and scents. Produced by SimEx-Iwerks, the theater showed condensed versions of popular children&#x27;s movies. The 4-D Theater previously showed &quot;Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs &quot;, one episode of &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot;, &quot;Rio&quot; and &quot;Storks&quot;. It closed in 2019 and was replaced with a giraffe encounter where guests can feed the giraffes for a fee.

====The Most Dangerous Animal in the World====

The Most Dangerous Animal in the World exhibit debuted at the Bronx Zoo on April 26, 1963. The exhibit was installed at the Great Apes House and it featured a statement about the danger humans pose.

The words: &quot;The Most Dangerous Animal in the World&quot; were printed in red on top of a cage. Behind the bars of the cage there was a mirror. The exhibit was reportedly still at the zoo in 1981.

===WCS&#x27;s Run for the Wild===
In April 2008, the zoo hosted the first Run for the Wild event. The event is a 5k run ( long) organized by the Wildlife Conservation Society with the goal of raising money and awareness for their conservation programs of endangered species. Each year, there is a set entry fee for participants with varying prices depending on age; child (3–15), adult, and senior (65+). WCS Members get a discounted fee. Along with the entry fee, there is a $35 minimum donation per adult/senior participant. The event offers free prizes for donors, based on donation size, ranging from a Run for the Wild T-shirt to a special animal experience at the zoo. All donations are tax-deductible. All participants are also offered free all-day entry to the zoo and its paid exhibits/attractions. The yearly event takes place at the end of April and originally began at 8 am for those wishing to actually run, and 8:45 for those who wish to simply walk or jog; the start times were changed to 7 am and 7:45 am in later years.

The event takes participants through the zoo before opening hours, starting at the Bronx River Parkway Entrance, through the Asian Plaza and African Plains, and ending by the Rockefeller Fountain near Astor Court. The trail also takes runners through the now-closed section of the zoo where the Rare Animal Range once stood. Each year, the event focuses on a specific endangered species or animal group to help raise funds for: 2009&#x27;s run was for gorillas, 2010 focused on tigers, 2011 helped raise funds to protect the Punta Tombo peninsula of Argentina for Magellanic penguins, 2012 focused on lions, both 2013 and 2014 focused on elephants, 2015 once again was for gorillas, and 2016&#x27;s run will allow participants to run on behalf of their favorite animal.

In 2011, another WCS institute, the New York Aquarium, held its own Run for the Wild event for sea turtles in early October. The 5k run began at the aquarium and led down the Riegelmann Boardwalk on Coney Island. The aquarium held a second run the following year for walruses. The event has not returned to the aquarium since.

==Conservation==
In 1905, the zoo&#x27;s first director, William T. Hornaday, along with President Theodore Roosevelt and other conservationists, created the American Bison Society (ABS) in an attempt to save the American bison from extinction. The bison had been depleted from tens-of-millions of animals to only a few hundred by the end of the 19th century due to westward expansion. The society worked to breed the species in captivity as well as raise public awareness, raise money to create protected reserves, and reintroduce bison back into the wild. On October 11, 1907, the first reintroduction of bison began when the zoo sent six males and nine females, by rail, to the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge in Oklahoma. Seven days later, the animals were successfully reintroduced to the park. By 1935, the society, who had successfully carried out several more reintroductions from bison kept in zoos and ranches, considered their work done and disbanded that year.

In 2005, the Wildlife Conservation Society resurrected and re-purposed the ABS to, &quot;help build the social and scientific foundations for the ecological restoration of bison&quot;, and, &quot;restore bison ecologically, not just animals in pens but actual functioning animals in the larger landscape&quot;, (Keith Aune, WCS bison coordinator). According to a study published in 2012, virtually all wild and captive bison in the United States are hybrids with cattle genes, with the exception of the two distinct breeding populations within Yellowstone National Park and their descendants. The cattle genes entered the bison population due to private ranchers hybridizing their bison to make them more docile, with some of these animals being accidentally reintroduced by the ABS. In response, in the fall of 2011, the WCS arranged for a herd of female bison originating from the American Prairie Reserve to be sent to the Colorado State University&#x27;s Animal Reproduction &amp; Biotechnology Laboratory to be used as surrogates in an attempt to transfer the fertilized embryos of genetically pure bison. After an ultrasound showed one female to be pregnant, the herd was moved to the zoo where, on June 20, 2012, the calf was born. The herd is kept in an off-exhibit section of the zoo and the goal is to eventually create a breeding herd of genetically pure bison through embryo transfers with the surrogate hybrid bison.

In 1981, the zoo successfully implanted a gaur embryo into a Holstein cow in an attempt to clone the endangered species.

In 1990, the zoo experienced a pest problem with the Canada goose. The park had become so over-crowded with the geese, that the zoo had to take action to decrease their numbers. Apart from their presence, the geese were very aggressive towards other birds and occasionally carried diseases into the park. To cope with the problem, the zoo hired a sharpshooter, who killed 19 geese. Zoo workers also destroyed 144 eggs found on the property. In 1991, the zoo employed a gentler method of sterilizing the birds.

In 2005, the zoo sent the frozen sperm of a male Indian rhinoceros to the Cincinnati Zoo where, four years later in 2009, it was thawed out and used in the first successful artificial insemination of the species when a calf was born in late 2010. The calf did not survive long-term.

In August 2006, the zoo adopted an orphaned snow leopard cub, named Leo. The 13-month-old cub was found stuck in mud following a landslide in Naltar Valley in Pakistan. The landslide had killed the cub&#x27;s mother. A Pakistani shepherd in the area found the cub with its female sibling, but the female had died a week later due to malnutrition. He then handed over the male cub to Pakistani authorities to care for him. Since there are no captive breeding programs or rehabilitation centers for snow leopards in Pakistan, the authorities decided to send the cub to the Bronx Zoo. The cat will be returned to its place of birth following construction of a rehab facility in the Naltar Valley with cooperation from the United States. On April 9, 2013, Leo sired a cub. He was the first cub of Leo.

In 2007, the zoo successfully reintroduced three Chinese alligators into the wild. In July 2009, the zoo announced that the reintroduced alligators had begun breeding naturally in the wild, producing 15 hatchlings. The breeding was a milestone in the zoo&#x27;s 10-year effort to reintroduce the species to the Yangtze River in China.

In January 2010, the zoo adopted four abandoned brown bear cubs. Three of the bears, two males and one female, were siblings born in 2009 and rescued from the ABC Islands in Alaska. The cubs were named Kootz, Denali, and Sitka. The fourth cub, a grizzly bear born in 2008, was rescued from Glacier National Park in Montana and named Glacier after the park. In 2015, two other rescued grizzly bears, who had been at the zoo since 1995, were sent to one of the zoo&#x27;s partner institutions, the Central Park Zoo.

The next month, an &quot;assurance colony&quot; of Kihansi spray toads was placed in the zoo. The species disappeared in their native Tanzania home.

In February 2011, the zoo took in two bald eagles that were rescued in Wyoming. The 5-year-old male was found in 2008 and was believed to have been hit by a car. The 3-year-old female was believed to have been injured during a storm. The birds were taken in by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and sent to the Woodford Cedar Run Wildlife Refuge in New Jersey for evaluation and care, where it was decided they were unable to survive in the wild.

In December 2012, five Chinese yellow-headed box turtles, a critically endangered species, were born.

In December 2015, the zoo rescued a juvenile Indian cobra which had stowed away on a cargo ship destined for New Jersey. The snake was found in poor condition being dehydrated, cold, and exposed to oil residue. The animal was brought to the zoo for recovery. It&#x27;s unclear how the snake got onto the ship since it set out from Singapore, which is outside of the species&#x27; natural range.

==Incidents==
===Human fatality===
On July 29, 1985, two female Siberian tigers killed 24-year-old animal keeper Robin Silverman after she entered their enclosure with a volunteer aide. It was unclear why Silverman entered the enclosure; the zoo&#x27;s general curator suspected a lapse in Silverman&#x27;s concentration, while her family suspected a failure on the part of the zoo. It was the first and only human fatality in the zoo&#x27;s history.

===Non-human deaths===
In the early 2000s, the zoo added a troop of Javan langurs to JungleWorld and mixed them with oriental small-clawed otters. The otters had previously mixed with other primate species in the enclosure without any problems. However, the new langurs made a habit of constantly bothering and attacking the otters. In June 2007 a group of otters grabbed a langur that was sitting at the water&#x27;s edge and proceeded to overpower, then drown it in full view of visitors. A keeper on the viewing deck attempted to break up the fight by whistling and yelling at the otters, to no avail. After killing the langur, the otters left the body floating in the pool. It was later removed by keepers. Part of the incident was recorded and uploaded to YouTube.

Soon after the incident, the otters were removed from the enclosure and given their own in the Children&#x27;s Zoo and elsewhere in JungleWorld.

===Animal escapes===
In 1902, a seven-month-old male jaguar broke out of his cage and escaped.

In July 1957, a platypus named Penelope who had recently made headlines for faking a pregnancy disappeared, abandoning her mate Cecil. Zookeepers searched the premises but found no evidence of her.

In February 1995, the zoo&#x27;s De Jur Aviary collapsed during a snowstorm with about 100 seabirds, including Inca terns and gulls, inside. During the collapse, some of the residents flew off and escaped. In total, about 30 birds were lost.

On March 26, 2011, the Bronx Zoo announced that World of Reptiles was closed after a venomous adolescent cobra was discovered missing from its off-exhibit enclosure on March 25. Zoo officials were confident the missing cobra would be found in the building and not outside, since the species is known to be uncomfortable in open areas. The missing snake quickly sparked a popular Twitter parody account, @BronxZoosCobra, which narrated the daily hijinks of the cobra. On March 31, zoo authorities found the snake in a non-public area of the reptile house.

On May 9, 2011, a female green peafowl escaped from the zoo before being caught on May 11.

On September 11, 2011, a lesser kudu escaped from its enclosure for about half an hour and then returned to its enclosure once a zoo worker opened the gate.

On April 26, 2023, an Indian peafowl given the nickname Raul escaped from the zoo and reportedly bit a man, although those reports were never confirmed. Raul flew back into the zoo at 11:17a.m. the next day.

===Happy the Elephant===

In the early 1970s, seven Indian elephants, named after the Seven Dwarfs from &quot;Snow White&quot;, were captured as calves in Thailand and dispersed among multiple U.S. zoos and circuses. Two of those calves, Grumpy and Happy, both females, were brought to the zoo in 1977. Over the next 25 years, the pair lived together, separated from the zoo&#x27;s other elephants. In July 2002, the zoo attempted to mix the pair with two other females, Patty and Maxine. However, the introduction failed when Patty and Maxine attacked the pair and injured Grumpy. Over the next several months, the elephant&#x27;s injuries worsened and, in October of that year, the zoo was forced to euthanize her. With her lifelong companion gone, Happy was paired with the zoo&#x27;s younger female, Sammy, whose companion Tus had also died in 2002. The two got along very well until Sammy developed severe liver disease and was also euthanized in early 2006. This left Patty, Maxine, and Happy as the zoo&#x27;s only remaining elephants.

Despite the fact that elephants are highly social animals, the zoo decided that making a second attempt at introducing Happy to the others was too risky, with there being too high a chance that she would be attacked. She has since lived without the company of other elephants. Due to this, the zoo has been criticized by multiple animal rights organizations for supposedly mistreating Happy. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) filed a formal complaint against the zoo with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), calling for them to strip the zoo of its accreditation. In Defense of Animals (IDA) has named the zoo the &quot;Hall of Shame Winner&quot; on their 2015, 2016, and 2017 &#x27;Ten Worst Zoos for Elephants&#x27;. IDA listed the zoo fourth on their 2012 list, fifth on their 2013 and 2014 lists, and eighth on their 2009 list. The organizations, as well as many online petitions (some of which gain up to 200,000 supporters), have called on the zoo to send Happy to an elephant sanctuary. However, the zoo said that moving her at this stage in her life might be potentially traumatizing for her, and that she has very strong bonds with her keepers and is well-adjusted to the zoo, where she has spent well over thirty years of her life.

In 2012, a reporter for the &quot;New York Post&quot; wrote that she is kept inside all year and in solitary confinement. The zoo claims that she and the other two elephants have equal access to outdoor yards, and that the three elephants have limited interactions with each other and extensive interactions with zoo keepers. All three animals share the same barn, but Happy lives in separate stalls and yards. In late 2018, one of the zoo&#x27;s other elephants, Maxine, was euthanized due to complications with her liver and kidneys.

A lawsuit against the Bronx Zoo, stating that Happy was legally &quot;a person with a right to be free&quot;, was dismissed in February 2020 by a judge of the Bronx County Supreme Court. However, in May 2021, the New York Court of Appeals agreed to hear the appeal, filed on behalf of Happy by the Nonhuman Rights Project. In June 2022, the Court of Appeals also ruled in favor of the zoo, saying in a 5–2 decision that the writ of habeas corpus did not apply to nonhuman animals.

===Ota Benga===

In 1906, Ota Benga, a man from the Mbuti pygmy ethnic group, was brought to the zoo by the American businessman and explorer Samuel Phillips Verner, and displayed there as an exhibit, though he was allowed to roam the grounds freely. He became fond of an orangutan named Dohong, &quot;the presiding genius of the Monkey House&quot;, who had been taught to perform tricks and imitate human behavior. The events leading to his &quot;exhibition&quot; alongside Dohong were gradual. Benga spent some of his time in the Monkey House exhibit, where the zoo encouraged him to hang his hammock and to shoot his bow and arrow at a target. On the first day of the exhibit, September 8, 1906, visitors found Benga in the Monkey House. Soon, a sign on the exhibit read:
Hornaday considered the exhibit a valuable spectacle for visitors; he was supported by Madison Grant, secretary of the New York Zoological Society, who lobbied to put Benga on-display alongside apes at the zoo. A decade later, Grant became prominent nationally as a racial anthropologist and eugenicist.

African-American clergymen immediately protested to zoo officials about the exhibit. James H. Gordon said, &quot;Our race, we think, is depressed enough, without exhibiting one of us with the apes ... We think we are worthy of being considered human beings, with souls.&quot; Gordon also thought the exhibit was hostile to Christianity and a promotion of Darwinism: &quot;The Darwinian theory is absolutely opposed to Christianity, and a public demonstration in its favor should not be permitted.&quot; A number of clergymen backed Gordon. In defense of the depiction of Benga as a lesser human, an editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested:
Benga was allowed to roam the grounds of the zoo. In response to the situation, as well as verbal and physical prods from the crowds, he became more mischievous and somewhat violent. Around this time, Rev. Dr. R. MacArthur of Calvary Baptist Church, was quoted in &quot;The New York Times&quot; saying: &quot;It is too bad that there is not some society like the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. We send our missionaries to Africa to Christianize the people, and then we bring one here to brutalize him.&quot; Soon, the zoo removed Benga from the grounds. Toward the end of 1906, Benga was released into Reverend Gordon&#x27;s custody. Gordon placed Benga in the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum, a church-sponsored orphanage in Brooklyn that Gordon supervised. As the unwelcome press attention continued, in January 1910, Gordon arranged for Benga&#x27;s relocation to Lynchburg, Virginia, where he lived with the family of Gregory W. Hayes. While there, Benga received tutoring from Lynchburg-based Harlem Renaissance poet Anne Spencer.

Benga died by suicide in 1916 at the age of 32. In 2020, WCS apologized for the zoo&#x27;s treatment of Benga and promotion of eugenics.

==In popular culture==

During the 1980s, some well known celebrities including British naturalist David Attenborough, Superman actor Christopher Reeve, and Muppets creator Jim Henson visited the Bronx Zoo for special programs, mostly dedicated to helping teenagers and children alike learn about animals.

In 2013, So What? Press published an issue of its comic series &quot;Tales of the Night Watchman&quot;, entitled &quot;The Night Collector&quot;, about a coven of vampires that takes over the bat exhibit at the Bronx Zoo. A zookeeper who specializes in bats is put at odds with his co-worker when it is discovered that the woman of their mutual affection has been turned into a vampire. It was written by Dave Kelly and illustrated by Molly Ostertag.

In March 2016, Animal Planet announced plans to produce a docu-series about the zoo, titled &quot;The Zoo&quot;. The series premiered on February 18, 2017 and gained a second season in March 2018.

<text>Island Records is a Jamaican multinational record label owned by Universal Music Group. It was founded in 1959 by Chris Blackwell, Graeme Goodall, and Leslie Kong in Jamaica, and was eventually sold to PolyGram in 1989. Island and A&amp;M Records, another label recently acquired by PolyGram, were both at the time the largest independent record labels in history, with Island having exerted a major influence on the progressive music scene in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s.
Island Records operates four international divisions: Island US, Island UK, Island Australia, and Island France (known as Vertigo France until 2014). Current key people include Island US president Darcus Beese, and MD Jon Turner. Partially due to its significant legacy, Island remains one of UMG&#x27;s pre-eminent record labels.

==History==

===Rise of the brand===

Island Records was founded in Jamaica on 4 July 1959 by Chris Blackwell, Graeme Goodall and Leslie Kong, and financed by Stanley Borden from RKO. Its name was inspired by the Harry Belafonte song &quot;Island in the Sun&quot;. Blackwell explained in 2009: &quot;I loved music so much, I just wanted to get into it, or be as close to it as I could.&quot; Blackwell&#x27;s first album was &quot;Lance Hayward at the Half Moon Hotel&quot;, which was recorded in late 1959.

Tom Hayes, the label&#x27;s sales manager between 1965 and 1967, referred to the early period of the label in the UK as &quot;organized chaos&quot;. The 1964 hit, &quot;My Boy Lollipop&quot;, sung by Jamaican singer Millie Small (1947–2020), was the label&#x27;s first success in the UK and led to a world tour that also involved Blackwell. Blackwell explained in a 50th anniversary documentary that he was only interested in building long-term careers at that stage in time, rather than short-term projects. Suzette Newman has been a close colleague of Chris Blackwell&#x27;s since working together in the early days of Island Records, and while there she ran the Mango world music label. Suzette Newman and Chris Salewicz were the editors for the book &quot;The Story of Island Records: Keep On Running&quot;.

Blackwell relocated to England in May 1962 to garner greater levels of attention after the local Jamaican sound systems proved to be overwhelmingly successful. The label was based at a now demolished basement in Kilburn, London Borough of Brent, in a property that was used by Sonny Roberts&#x27;s Planetone label and whose landlord was Lee Gopthal who would later create Trojan Records. The vast majority of the artists who had signed to Blackwell&#x27;s fledgling label while he was in Jamaica agreed to allow the musical entrepreneur to release their music in the UK. While in England, Blackwell travelled throughout the city carrying his stock with him and sold to record stores in the city. He did not provide any copies to radio stations, as they would not play any of the Island music; the music was also not reviewed by the press. Meanwhile, Goodall left to start the Doctor Bird record label in 1965.

Blackwell signed the Spencer Davis Group to the label (at that time, many Island releases were being distributed by Philips/Fontana). The group became very popular and Island started their own independent series to spotlight UK rock talent. They signed artists such as John Martyn, Fairport Convention, Free, and greatly influenced the growing FM radio market. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, they were a major label in England with artists including Roxy Music, King Crimson, Sparks, Traffic, the Wailers, Cat Stevens, Steve Winwood and many others. (In the US, many of their releases were licensed to A&amp;M prior to signing up distribution deals with Capitol and later Atlantic, and also independent distribution.)

For Toots and the Maytals, the group that introduced the term &quot;reggae&quot; in song with their 1968 single &quot;Do the Reggay&quot;, Chris Blackwell was the one who decided on the line-up of the group before introducing them to an international audience. Blackwell had signed Bob Marley, and now Toots and the Maytals. In November 2016, Jackie Jackson described the formation of the group in a radio interview for Kool 97 FM Jamaica. Accompanied by Paul Douglas and Radcliffe &quot;Dougie&quot; Bryan in studio, Jackson explained:

We&#x27;re all original members of Toots and the Maytals band. First it was Toots and the Maytals, three guys: Toots, Raleigh, and Jerry. ... And then they were signed to Island Records, Chris Blackwell. And we were their recording band. One day we were summoned to Chris&#x27; house. And he says, &quot;Alright gentleman, I think it&#x27;s time. This Toots and the Maytals looks like it&#x27;s going to be a big thing&quot;. By this time he had already signed Bob (Marley). So in his camp, Island Records, there was Toots and the Maytals], the late Bob Marley; we were talking about reggae is going international now. We kept on meeting and he (Blackwell) decided that the backing band that back all of the songs, the recording band, should be the Maytals band. So everything came under Toots and the Maytals. So we became Maytals also. And then we hit the road in 1975 ... we were the opening act for the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, and Jackson Browne. We were the opening act for The Who for about two weeks.

In 1969, Island Records acquired a deconsecrated 17th century church building at 8-10 Basing Street, in the Ladbroke Grove area of Notting Hill in West London. The building was refurbished to create the Island Studios recording studio, while also serving as the new location for Island Records&#x27; offices.

The first Toots and the Maytals album released and distributed by Chris Blackwell&#x27;s Island Records was &quot;Funky Kingston.&quot; The Maytals had recently added a full-time backing band that included drummer Paul Douglas and bassist Jackie Jackson, and Chris Blackwell joined the group in the studio as a co-producer for the album. Music critic Lester Bangs described the album in &quot;Stereo Review&quot; as &quot;perfection, the most exciting and diversified set of reggae tunes by a single artist yet released.&quot; As Blackwell says, &quot;The Maytals were unlike anything else ... sensational, raw and dynamic.&quot; Blackwell had a strong commitment to Toots and the Maytals, saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve known Toots longer than anybody – much longer than Bob (Bob Marley). Toots is one of the purest human beings I&#x27;ve met in my life, pure almost to a fault.&quot;

Despite the initial establishment work that Blackwell completed almost single-handedly, Island struggled as a business in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Bob Marley&#x27;s 1981 death was detrimental to the label, especially after its having engineered Marley&#x27;s international breakthrough only a few years earlier, while Irish rock band U2, which had signed to Island in March 1980, was growing in popularity, but had not yet reached the international superstar status that was to come. In 1981, Blackwell also used the label to finance a new film production and distribution company, producing the film &quot;Countryman&quot;. In 1982, Paul Morley and producer Trevor Horn started the ZTT label under the Island banner and Blackwell was known to approve excessive spending by the label. Morley recalls in a 2009 book about Island Records:

I eventually grew to appreciate how Chris Blackwell, and therefore Island Records, was not about one thing, or one style, or one system, or one way of doing things ... [I began] reflecting how the world functions and reinvents itself precisely because it is a fluid, sometimes dangerous, always exhilarating union of systems and beliefs and the best way of allowing the world to progress is to mix up and place in glorious conflict these various systems and beliefs.

In 1983, the film production company formed a partnership with Shep Gordon&#x27;s Alive Enterprises to form Island Alive and had success with &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot;, &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;, and &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;. The partnership was dissolved in 1985. In August 1987, the company was not able to pay US$5 million that it owed to U2 in royalties for &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; album, as it had diverted the funds to finance several unsuccessful films. U2 responded by negotiating a deal whereby they received a stake in the label that was estimated to be around 10 per cent.

The label&#x27;s 4th &amp; Broadway division, operating since the mid-1980s, achieved some success marketing alternative hip hop and dance-pop music with artists such as Eric B. and Rakim and the Stereo MCs. Mango (Chaka Demus and Pliers) was another Island dance-oriented subsidiary, while it was singer Robert Palmer who achieved worldwide success with the rock song &quot;Addicted to Love&quot; in 1986. African musicians such as King Sunny Adé and Angélique Kidjo were also championed by Blackwell.

===PolyGram acquisition===
In July 1989, Blackwell sold Island Records and Island Music to the PolyGram UK Group for £180 million; he explained in 2009: &quot;It had gotten too big and too corporate for me and I couldn&#x27;t really handle it.&quot; Following the sale, Island was no longer an independent company, but Blackwell was given a position on PolyGram&#x27;s board and stayed on as CEO of PolyGram&#x27;s new Island Entertainment division for ten years. PolyGram immediately began reissuing much of the Island back catalogue on compact disc and expanded Island&#x27;s reach through its global manufacturing and distribution network, but the label was relatively unfocused in the 1990s. Between 1993 and 1995, Island had a sub-label called the Island Red Label, which focused on independent artists.

Blackwell eventually ended his association with the company in 1997, as the corporate life hindered the independent ethos of his personal life. &quot;I never really had a job until I sold Island to PolyGram in 1989. It had gotten too corporate,&quot; he commented afterwards. After Blackwell left, PolyGram closed Island&#x27;s film business. Blackwell left to found the Palm Pictures company and run a chain of boutique hotels in Miami, US and the Caribbean, including the very exclusive Goldeneye, once the Jamaican home of James Bond creator Ian Fleming. Then in May 1998, all of PolyGram and its associated labels were purchased by Seagram which announced its plan to integrate PolyGram with UMG to produce an estimated cost savings, within a couple of years, of between US$275 million and $300 million annually. Seagram further explained that the acquisition would unite a significant international presence with a thriving domestic business, as more than three-quarters of PolyGram&#x27;s sales were outside the US.

===Under Universal Music Group===
In December 1998 and the first three months of 1999, UMG placed three divisions under the management of the Island brand: one in the UK, one in the US, and one in Germany. In each territory, these companies were merged under umbrella groups:

*In the UK, Island Records Group, now operating under Virgin EMI Records since 2013.
*In the US, Island, Mercury, and Def Jam and 14 other record labels were merged into The Island Def Jam Music Group; however, within the year, Island/Mercury decided to build upon the success of Def Jam Recordings and re-incorporated the label as The Island Def Jam Music Group. On April 1, 2014, Universal Music announced the disbandment of IDJMG, one of four operational umbrella groups within Universal Music. Effective as of the same day of the announcement, Island Records and Def Jam will now operate as autonomous record labels.
*In Germany, Island and Mercury merged to become divisions of the Island Mercury Label group.

However, in 2001, UMG was merged with French company Vivendi S.A. to create Vivendi Universal S.A.; but the music company remains under the name Universal Music Group (UMG).

In the US, Island became a predominantly pop/rock label, as their urban artists were assigned to either Def Jam or Def Soul, a new Island/Def Jam R&amp;B imprint. Following the takeover of Island by UMG, flagship band U2 were dissatisfied after chief Jason Iley moved to the Mercury label in the mid-2000s and signed with Mercury for the UK and Interscope Records for the US. However, successful artists such as Tricky and PJ Harvey were impressed by the label and signed on as artists. Tricky explained: &quot;I knew I could get freedom. I knew I could do what I wanted to do.&quot;, while Harvey later stated:

I came to work with them, sort of fully formed—the way that I looked, the way that I sounded: that was already there. And I felt, like, that they just supported where that was going to go.

The label celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009.

In 2009, Island Records marked the 50th anniversary of its foundation in Jamaica by Chris Blackwell with a series of live concerts and an exhibition under the Island 50 banner. The events were a celebration of the street-cool, independent outlook and striking visual imagery at the label&#x27;s creative core. These festivities centred around a week-long run of shows at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire and Bush Hall in London. The concerts featured performances tracing the label&#x27;s history from its reggae and jazz roots to the modern era. Among the artists who appeared were Sly &amp; Robbie, Ernest Ranglin, Paul Weller, The Compass Point All Stars, The I Threes, Aswad, Kid Creole &amp; the Coconuts, Grace Jones, Steel Pulse, Keane, Tom Tom Club, Toots &amp; The Maytals, The Mighty Diamonds, Yusuf Islam/ Cat Stevens, Bombay Bicycle Club, Baaba Maal and U2. Another Island 50 tribute event was held over four nights at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, with Marianne Faithfull, Grace Jones and Sly &amp; Robbie all appearing, and Chris Blackwell holding a Question &amp; Answer session.

There was also a major exhibition at the Vinyl Factory Gallery in Soho, held in an open space beneath the record shop Phonica. The exhibition featured a display of treasured musical artifacts, including the Trabant car from the sleeve of U2&#x27;s &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, Nick Drake&#x27;s guitar, the dress worn by Amy Winehouse at the 2008 Grammy Awards, the handwritten lyric sheet for Winehouse&#x27;s song &quot;Love Is a Losing Game&quot; and Bob Marley&#x27;s passport application form. The exhibition contained 800 prints showcasing the work for Island of the photographers Adrian Boot, Jean-Paul Goude, Anton Corbijn, Gered Mankowitz, Keith Morris and Brian Cooke, and the London exhibition also featured live performances at the Vinyl Factory Gallery by DJ Shadow and PJ Harvey.

===Into Island&#x27;s sixth decade: 2009–2017===
Following its 50th anniversary in 2009, Island Records entered its sixth decade on a tide of optimism. The years that followed saw fresh success for a number of established acts, including PJ Harvey, Keane, Paul Weller and Bombay Bicycle Club and an exciting wave of new signings. In its largest live production since its 2009 anniversary, the label also staged a concert by The Weeknd and Jack Garratt on Osea Island, a small island in Essex, as part of a bespoke one-day festival for 400 guests, including label staff, media and 200 fans who obtained tickets via a ballot.

2016 proved a particularly successful year for the label in the UK: over a seven-week period between April and June, four separate Island acts spent at least one week at number one. The albums concerned were PJ Harvey&#x27;s &quot;The Hope Six Demolition Project&quot;, Drake&#x27;s &quot;Views&quot; (which spent two weeks at number one), Ariana Grande&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous Woman&quot; and Catfish &amp; The Bottlemen&#x27;s &quot;The Ride&quot;.

====Island&#x27;s sixth decade: the artists====
PJ Harvey&#x27;s eighth studio album, 2011&#x27;s &quot;Let England Shake&quot;, was one of the key records of Island&#x27;s sixth decade. Made in a cliff-top church in Dorset, it won the 2011 Mercury Music Prize, making Harvey the only artist to land the prestigious award twice (she had prevailed ten years previously with &quot;Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea&quot;). Mumford &amp; Sons, who grew out of a series of jam sessions in London in 2007, signed a licensing deal with Island in 2009. Heralded as standard bearers for a vibrant new wave of folkish, countrified rock, their debut album, &quot;Sigh No More&quot;, sold two million, reaching number two in Britain and America. It also won best British album at the BRIT Awards in February 2011. The follow-up, &quot;Babel&quot;, did even better in 2012, becoming the UK&#x27;s fastest-selling album of that year, going to number one in Britain and the US and winning album of the year at the 2013 Grammy Awards. Island also secured the signing of English indie rock band Florence and the Machine whose debut studio album &quot;Lungs&quot; (2009) sold four million copies, and spent over 12 months on the UK Albums Chart before being crowned British Album Of The Year at the 2010 BRIT Awards ceremony. &quot;Lungs&quot; was followed by the studio albums &quot;Ceremonials&quot; (2011), and &quot;How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful&quot; (2015).

Keane were another of the big successes of Island&#x27;s sixth decade. Having topped the charts with their five million-selling debut album &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot; in 2004, they went on to secure five consecutive number-one albums in the UK (a feat bettered only by The Beatles), with subsequent releases &quot;Under the Iron Sea&quot; (2006), &quot;Perfect Symmetry&quot; (2008), &quot;Night Train&quot; (2010) and &quot;Strangeland&quot; (2012) all topping the charts. Paul Weller&#x27;s relationship with Island dates back to his fourth solo album, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Heavy Soul&quot;, and its 2000 follow-up Heliocentric. He returned to the label in 2008 and began an outstanding trilogy of releases that contained some of his strongest solo work &quot;22 Dreams&quot; (2008), the Mercury Music Prize-nominated &quot;Wake Up The Nation&quot; (2010) and &quot;Sonik Kicks&quot; (2012).

North London quartet Bombay Bicycle Club also released four albums on Island, with each one signalling a change of direction: the indie-rock of 2009&#x27;s &quot;I Had The Blues But I Shook Them Loose&quot; paved the way for 2010&#x27;s folkier &quot;Flaws&quot;, the modern rock of 2011&#x27;s &quot;A Different Kind Of Fix&quot; and the broad-based invention of 2014&#x27;s &quot;So Long, See You Tomorrow&quot;. Having built a loyal live following, Catfish &amp; The Bottlemen signed to Island in 2014. After reaching platinum sales status in the UK with their Top Ten debut album, &quot;The Balcony&quot;, the Welsh rock band won the BBC Introducing Award at the first BBC Music Awards in 2014 and were crowned British Breakthrough Act at the BRIT Awards in 2016 (an award voted for by Radio 1 listeners). Their second album, 2016&#x27;s &quot;The Ride&quot;, was a UK number one.

Island was also responsible for securing major British breakthroughs for two of the 21st century&#x27;s biggest international superstars in Drake and The Weeknd. The success of Toronto hip-hop artist Drake came after the label had worked patiently to build his profile over a number of years, culminating in the success of his fourth album &quot;Views&quot; and its attendant singles in 2016. &quot;One Dance&quot;, Drake&#x27;s first number one single in the UK, had 1.95 million sales to become Britain&#x27;s biggest-selling single of 2016. The single&#x27;s 15-week run at number one equalled the mark for the second longest in UK chart history. With the Island-signed Mike Posner having held the number one spot with &quot;I Took a Pill in Ibiza&quot; for four consecutive weeks before being replaced by &quot;One Dance&quot;, Island held the top spot in the UK singles chart for 19 consecutive weeks between March and August 2016. To crown a record-breaking year, Drake was named the world&#x27;s best-selling recording artist of 2016 by international music industry organisation IFPI in February 2017.

Canadian singer and songwriter The Weeknd also cemented his position as one of the world&#x27;s leading recording artists, with the 2016 success of his third album &quot;Starboy&quot;. Its success was the culmination of a strategy that had seen Island build his UK profile over a four-year period that dated from his 2013 studio album &quot;Kiss Land&quot;. Island&#x27;s commitment to further nurturing the careers of global superstars was reiterated in June 2016 with the signing of Sean Paul. The Jamaican singer, rapper and songwriter released &quot;No Lie&quot; (featuring the Youngest English-Albanian Dua Lipa), his first single for Island, in November 2016.

Signed to Island via a licensing deal with independent label PMR, Disclosure were formed by two brothers from Reigate in Surrey, Guy and Howard Lawrence. The duo discovered the joys of nineties house, techno and two-step garage while studying music production at college, and went on to enjoy success with their two Island albums &quot;Settle&quot; (2013) and &quot;Caracal&quot; (2015), making extensive use of an array of guest vocalists including Sam Smith, Jamie Woon, Eliza Doolittle, Lorde and Gregory Porter. One of the acts who guested on &quot;Settle&quot; was AlunaGeorge, a boy-girl duo from London (singer Aluna Francis and musician and producer George Reid), who released their debut album, &quot;Body Music&quot;, on Island in 2013. Like Disclosure, Jessie Ware signed to Island through a link with independent label PMR. A soulful singer-songwriter from Brixton, Ware was nominated for the 2012 Mercury Music Prize with her smooth debut album, Devotion, and enjoyed further success with 2014&#x27;s Tough Love. Another Island act to enjoy a significant breakthrough was Yorkshire singer John Newman, who topped the UK charts with his first solo single, &quot;Love Me Again&quot;, and his debut album Tribute.

In May 2018, incumbent president David Massey left Island to join Sony Music Entertainment&#x27;s relaunch of Arista Records. Darcus Beese, OBE took on the role of president upon Massey&#x27;s departure. To make the transition, Beese relocated from the United Kingdom to Island&#x27;s offices at Universal Music Group&#x27;s New York City building.

In June 2021, Imran Majid and Justin Eshak were named co-CEOs of Island Records. They assumed the position on January 1, 2022.
===Seventh decade and further expansions: 2019–present===
On 23 July 2020, Universal Music Group and its local subsidiary MCA Music launched Island Records Philippines, the first Southeast Asian branch of the 61-year old label. The Philippines branch is led by former Sony Music Philippines and Sindikato Management executive Enzo Valdez.

==Manga Entertainment==
Island World Communications, under the leadership of Blackwell and Andy Frain, created Manga Entertainment Ltd, the anime and live action Japanese film division of Island in 1991. In that year, Laurence Guinness, the Senior VP at Island World Communications bought the distribution license for &quot;Akira&quot; from ICA Projects in London, and the distribution of what was the label&#x27;s first release is considered a crucial milestone in the establishment of anime in the UK. In 1994, Island sold the distribution licenses for most of Manga&#x27;s releases to Siren Entertainment, an independent entertainment company in Australia. Those rights were then given to Madman Entertainment in 1999 when Siren became solely an acquisitions company.

==Artists and recordings==
The recording roster of Island Records, both past and present, has been and continues to be diverse. The label continues to champion new music, a practice that was highlighted at the Island Records 50th anniversary event, at which new artists provided the entertainment.

<text>Heide (; Holsatian: &quot;Heid&quot;) is a town in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is the capital of the &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) Dithmarschen. Population: 22,000.

The German word &quot;Heide&quot; means &quot;heath&quot;. In the 15th century four adjoining villages decided to build a church in the &quot;middle of the heath&quot;.

At this time Dithmarschen was an independent peasant republic. Heide became a town in the 19th century.

Heide has the largest un-built-upon market square in Germany, with 4.7 hectares. It is used primarily as a parking lot and has approximately 500 parking spaces. In 2016, the city staged 3 car-free Sundays on the market square for the first time.

<doc id="92371" wikidata="Q190068" url="?curid=92371" title="Synecdoche">
<text>Synecdoche ( ) is a type of metonymy; it is a figure of speech that uses a term for a part of something to refer to the whole (&quot;pars pro toto&quot;), or vice versa (&quot;totum pro parte&quot;). The term is derived .

Common English synecdoches include &quot;suits&quot; for &quot;businessmen&quot;, &quot;wheels&quot; for &quot;automobile&quot;, and &quot;boots&quot; for &quot;soldiers&quot;. Another example is the use of government buildings to refer to their resident agencies or bodies, such as &quot;The Pentagon&quot; for the United States Department of Defense and &quot;Downing Street&quot; or &quot;Number 10&quot; for the office of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and the use of the name of a country&#x27;s capital city to refer to the government of the country.

==Definition==

Synecdoche is a rhetorical trope and a kind of metonymy—a figure of speech using a term to denote one thing to refer to a related thing.

Synecdoche (and thus metonymy) is distinct from metaphor, although in the past, it was considered a sub-species of metaphor, intending metaphor as a type of conceptual substitution (as Quintilian does in Book VIII). In Lanham&#x27;s &quot;Handlist of Rhetorical Terms&quot;, the three terms possess somewhat restrictive definitions in tune with their etymologies from Greek:
* &quot;Metaphor&quot;: changing a word from its literal meaning to one not properly applicable but analogous to it; assertion of identity—rather than likeness as with simile.
* &quot;Metonymy&quot;: substituting an attribute of or object associated with something for the thing itself (e.g., substituting &quot;the crown&quot; for &quot;the monarch&quot;).

==Classification==
Synecdoche is often used as a type of personification by attaching a human aspect to a nonhuman thing. It is used in reference to political relations, including &quot;having a footing&quot;, to mean a country or organization is in a position to act, or &quot;the wrong hands&quot;, to describe opposing groups, usually in the context of military power.

The two main types of synecdoche are &quot;microcosm&quot; and &quot;macrocosm&quot;. A microcosm uses a part of something to refer to the entirety. An example of this is saying &quot;I need a hand&quot; with a project, but needing the entire person. A macrocosm is the opposite, using the name of the entire structure of something to refer to a small part. An example of this is saying &quot;the world&quot; while referring to a &quot;certain country&quot; or part of the planet.
The figure of speech is divided into the image (what the speaker uses to refer to something) and the subject (what is referred to).

In politics, the residence or location of an executive can be used to represent the office itself. For example, &quot;the White House&quot; can mean the Executive Office of the President of the United States; &quot;Buckingham Palace&quot; can mean the monarchy of the United Kingdom; &quot;the Sublime Porte&quot; can mean the Ottoman Empire; and &quot;the Kremlin&quot; can mean the government of Russia. The Élysée Palace might indicate the President of the French Republic.

Sonnets and other forms of love poetry frequently use synecdoches to characterize the beloved in terms of individual body parts rather than a coherent whole. This practice is especially common in the Petrarchan sonnet, where the idealised beloved is often described part by part, head-to-toe.

Synecdoche is also popular in advertising. Since synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole, its use requires the audience to make associations and &quot;fill in the gaps&quot;, engaging with the ad by thinking about the product. Moreover, catching the attention of an audience with advertising is often referred to by advertisers with the synecdoche &quot;getting eyeballs&quot;. Synecdoche is common in spoken English, especially in reference to sports. The names of cities are used as shorthand for their sports teams to describe events and their outcomes, such as &quot;Denver won Monday&#x27;s game,&quot; while accuracy would require specifying the sports team&#x27;s name.

Kenneth Burke (1945), an American literary theorist, declared that in rhetoric, the four master tropes, or figures of speech, are metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony. Burke&#x27;s primary concern with these four master tropes is more than simply their figurative usage, but includes their role in the discovery and description of the truth. He described synecdoche as &quot;part of the whole, whole for the part, container for the contained, sign for the thing signified, material for the thing made… cause for the effect, effect for the cause, genus for the species, species for the genus&quot;. In addition, Burke suggests synecdoche patterns can include reversible pairs such as disease-cure. Burke proclaimed the noblest synecdoche is found in the description of &quot;microcosm and macrocosm&quot; since microcosm is related to macrocosm as part to the whole, and either the whole can represent the part or the part can represent the whole&quot;. Burke compares synecdoche with the concept of &quot;representation&quot;, especially in the political sense in which elected representatives stand in &quot;pars pro toto&quot; for their electorate.

==Examples==
===Part referring to whole &quot;(pars pro toto)&quot;===
* Referring to a person according to a single characteristic: &quot;gray beard&quot; meaning an old man 
* Referring to a sword as a &quot;blade&quot;
* Describing a complete vehicle as &quot;wheels&quot;, an entire airplane as a private jet, or a manual transmission vehicle as a &quot;stick&quot;
* Referring to a country&#x27;s currency by using the common name of a single coin within that currency, such as referring to the Canadian Dollar as &quot;the Loonie&quot;

===General class name that denotes a specific member of that or an associated class===
* Referring to a species of an organism or virus by the name of one of its hierarchical groups, e.g., &quot;Coronavirus [specifically meaning the COVID-19 virus] is rampant throughout the city.&quot;
* Using technology specifically to refer to high technology or electronic devices

===Specific class name referring to general set of associated things===
* &quot;John Hancock&quot; (used in the United States), for the signature of any person
* A genericized trademark, for example, &quot;Xerox&quot; for any variety of duplicate made on a photocopier, &quot;Coke&quot; for any variety of cola (or for any variety of soft drink, as in the southern United States), &quot;Kleenex&quot; for facial tissues, &quot;Vaseline&quot; for petroleum jelly, &quot;Band-Aid&quot; (in the United States) for any variety of adhesive bandage, &quot;Tide&quot; (US) for any variety of laundry detergent, &quot;Hoover&quot; (UK) for any variety of vacuum cleaner, or &quot;Styrofoam&quot; (US) for any product made of expanded polystyrene.

===Referring to material actually or supposedly used to make something===
* &quot;brass&quot; for brass instruments, or the shell casings of bullet cartridges, or the medals and stars of high-ranking military officers
* &quot;lead&quot; for bullets, lead being the most common material for making bullets, or for the graphite core of a pencil
* &quot;vinyl&quot; for phonograph records
* &quot;cement&quot; for concrete, cement being just the binder in concrete

===Container refers to its contents===
* &quot;barrel&quot; for a barrel of oil, or the equivalent volume of a standard barrel
* &quot;keg&quot; for a keg of beer
* &quot;She drank the cup&quot;, to refer to her drinking of the cup&#x27;s contents

<doc id="92373" wikidata="Q219102" url="?curid=92373" title="Cushing's syndrome">
<text>Cushing&#x27;s syndrome is a collection of signs and symptoms due to prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids such as cortisol. Signs and symptoms may include high blood pressure, abdominal obesity but with thin arms and legs, reddish stretch marks, a round red face due to facial plethora, a fat lump between the shoulders, weak muscles, weak bones, acne, and fragile skin that heals poorly. Women may have more hair and irregular menstruation or loss of menses, with the exact mechanisms of why still unknown. Occasionally there may be changes in mood, headaches, and a chronic feeling of tiredness.
Cushing&#x27;s syndrome is caused by either excessive cortisol-like medication, such as prednisone, or a tumor that either produces or results in the production of excessive cortisol by the adrenal glands. Cases due to a pituitary adenoma are known as Cushing&#x27;s disease, which is the second most common cause of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome after medication. A number of other tumors, often referred to as ectopic due to their placement outside the pituitary, may also cause Cushing&#x27;s. Some of these are associated with inherited disorders such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and Carney complex. Diagnosis requires a number of steps. The first step is to check the medications a person takes. The second step is to measure levels of cortisol in the urine, saliva or in the blood after taking dexamethasone. If this test is abnormal, the cortisol may be measured late at night. If the cortisol remains high, a blood test for ACTH may be done.
Most cases can be treated and cured. If brought on by medications, these can often be slowly decreased if still required or slowly stopped. If caused by a tumor, it may be treated by a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation. If the pituitary was affected, other medications may be required to replace its lost function. With treatment, life expectancy is usually normal. Some, in whom surgery is unable to remove the entire tumor, have an increased risk of death.
About two to three cases per million persons are caused overtly by a tumor. It most commonly affects people who are 20 to 50 years of age. Women are affected three times more often than men. A mild degree of overproduction of cortisol without obvious symptoms, however, is more common. Cushing&#x27;s syndrome was first described by American neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing in 1932. Cushing&#x27;s syndrome may also occur in other animals including cats, dogs, and horses.

==Signs and symptoms==


Symptoms include rapid weight gain, particularly of the trunk and face with sparing of the limbs (central obesity). Common signs include the growth of fat pads along the collarbone, on the back of the neck (&quot;buffalo hump&quot; or lipodystrophy), and on the face (&quot;moon face&quot;). Other symptoms include excess sweating, dilation of capillaries, thinning of the skin (which causes easy bruising and dryness, particularly the hands) and mucous membranes, purple or red striae (the weight gain in Cushing&#x27;s syndrome stretches the skin, which is thin and weakened, causing it to hemorrhage) on the trunk, buttocks, arms, legs, or breasts, proximal muscle weakness (hips, shoulders), and hirsutism (facial male-pattern hair growth), baldness and/or extremely dry and brittle hair. In rare cases, Cushing&#x27;s can cause hypocalcemia. The excess cortisol may also affect other endocrine systems and cause, for example, insomnia, inhibited aromatase, reduced libido, impotence in men, and amenorrhoea, oligomenorrhea and infertility in women due to elevations in androgens. Studies have also shown that the resultant amenorrhea is due to hypercortisolism, which feeds back onto the hypothalamus resulting in decreased levels of GnRH release.

Many of the features of Cushing&#x27;s are those seen in metabolic syndrome, including insulin resistance, hypertension, obesity, and elevated blood levels of triglycerides.

Cognitive conditions, including memory and attention dysfunctions, as well as depression, are commonly associated with elevated cortisol, and may be early indicators of exogenous or endogenous Cushing&#x27;s. Depression and anxiety disorders are also common.

Other striking and distressing skin changes that may appear in Cushing&#x27;s syndrome include facial acne, susceptibility to superficial fungus (dermatophyte and malassezia) infections, and the characteristic purplish, atrophic striae on the abdomen.

Other signs include increased urination (and accompanying increased thirst), persistent high blood pressure (due to cortisol&#x27;s enhancement of epinephrine&#x27;s vasoconstrictive effect) and insulin resistance (especially common with ACTH production outside the pituitary), leading to high blood sugar and insulin resistance which can lead to diabetes mellitus. Insulin resistance is accompanied by skin changes such as acanthosis nigricans in the axilla and around the neck, as well as skin tags in the axilla. Untreated Cushing&#x27;s syndrome can lead to heart disease and increased mortality. Cortisol can also exhibit mineralocorticoid activity in high concentrations, worsening the hypertension and leading to hypokalemia (common in ectopic ACTH secretion) and hypernatremia (increased Na+ ions concentration in plasma). Furthermore, excessive cortisol may lead to gastrointestinal disturbances, opportunistic infections, and impaired wound healing related to cortisol&#x27;s suppression of the immune and inflammatory responses. Osteoporosis is also an issue in Cushing&#x27;s syndrome since osteoblast activity is inhibited. Additionally, Cushing&#x27;s syndrome may cause sore and aching joints, particularly in the hip, shoulders, and lower back.

Brain changes such as cerebral atrophy may occur. This atrophy is associated with areas of high glucocorticoid receptor concentrations such as the hippocampus and correlates highly with psychopathological personality changes.

Additional symptoms may include:

* Rapid weight gain
* Moodiness, irritability, or depression
* Muscle and bone weakness
* Memory and attention dysfunction
* Osteoporosis
* Diabetes mellitus
* Hypertension
* Immune suppression
* Sleep disturbances
* Menstrual disorders such as amenorrhea in women
* Infertility in women
* Impotence in men
* Hirsutism
* Baldness
* Hypercholesterolemia

=== Hyperpigmentation ===
Cushing&#x27;s syndrome due to excess ACTH may also result in hyperpigmentation. This is due to melanocyte-stimulating hormone production as a byproduct of ACTH synthesis from pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). Alternatively, it is proposed that the high levels of ACTH, β-lipotropin, and γ-lipotropin, which contain weak MSH function, can act on the melanocortin 1 receptor. A variant of Cushing&#x27;s disease can be caused by ectopic, i.e. extra pituitary, ACTH production from, for example, a small-cell lung cancer.

When Cushing&#x27;s syndrome is caused by an increase of cortisol at the level of the adrenal glands (via an adenoma or hyperplasia), negative feedback ultimately reduces ACTH production in the pituitary. In these cases, ACTH levels remain low and no hyperpigmentation develops.

==Causes==
Cushing&#x27;s syndrome may result from any cause of increased glucocorticoid levels, whether due to medication or internal processes. Some sources however do not consider the glucocorticoid medication-induced condition as &quot;Cushing&#x27;s syndrome&quot; proper, instead using the term &quot;Cushingoid&quot; to describe the medication&#x27;s side effects which mimic the endogenous condition.

Cushing&#x27;s disease is a specific type of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome caused by a pituitary tumor leading to excessive production of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). Excessive ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce high levels of cortisol, producing the disease state. While all Cushing&#x27;s disease gives Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, not all Cushing&#x27;s syndrome is due to Cushing&#x27;s disease. Several possible causes of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome are known including the taking of herbal supplements over-the-counter that do not list glucocorticoids in their ingredients.

===Exogenous===
The most common cause of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome is the use of prescribed glucocorticoids to treat other diseases (iatrogenic Cushing&#x27;s syndrome). Glucocorticoids are used in treatment of a variety of disorders, including asthma and rheumatoid arthritis, and also used for immunosuppression after organ transplants. Administration of synthetic ACTH is also possible, but ACTH is less often prescribed due to cost and lesser utility. Rarely, Cushing&#x27;s syndrome can also be due to the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate. In exogenous Cushing&#x27;s, the adrenal glands may often gradually atrophy due to lack of stimulation by ACTH, the production of which is suppressed by glucocorticoid medication. Abruptly stopping the medication can thus result in acute and potentially life-threatening adrenal insufficiency and the dose must hence be slowly and carefully tapered off to allow internal cortisol production to pick up. In some cases, patients never recover sufficient levels of internal production and must continue taking glucocorticoids at physiological doses for life.

Cushing&#x27;s syndrome in childhood is especially rare; it usually results from use of glucocorticoid medication.

=== Endogenous ===
Endogenous Cushing&#x27;s syndrome results from some derangement of the body&#x27;s own system of cortisol secretion. Normally, ACTH is released from the pituitary gland when necessary to stimulate the release of cortisol from the adrenal glands.

* In pituitary Cushing&#x27;s, a benign pituitary adenoma secretes ACTH. This is also known as Cushing&#x27;s disease and is responsible for 70% of endogenous Cushing&#x27;s syndrome.
* In adrenal Cushing&#x27;s, excess cortisol is produced by adrenal gland tumors, hyperplastic adrenal glands, or adrenal glands with nodular adrenal hyperplasia.
* Tumors outside the normal pituitary-adrenal system can produce ACTH (occasionally with CRH) that affects the adrenal glands. This etiology is called ectopic or paraneoplastic Cushing&#x27;s disease and is seen in diseases such as small cell lung cancer.
* Finally, rare cases of CRH-secreting tumors (without ACTH secretion) have been reported, which stimulates pituitary ACTH production.

===Pseudo-Cushing&#x27;s syndrome===
Elevated levels of total cortisol can also be due to estrogen found in oral contraceptive pills that contain a mixture of estrogen and progesterone, leading to pseudo-Cushing&#x27;s syndrome. Estrogen can cause an increase of cortisol-binding globulin and thereby cause the total cortisol level to be elevated. However, the total free cortisol, which is the active hormone in the body, as measured by a 24-hour urine collection for urinary free cortisol, is normal.

==Pathophysiology==
The hypothalamus is in the brain and the pituitary gland sits just below it. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). ACTH travels via the blood to the adrenal gland, where it stimulates the release of cortisol. Cortisol is secreted by the cortex of the adrenal gland from a region called the zona fasciculata in response to ACTH. Elevated levels of cortisol exert negative feedback on CRH in the hypothalamus, which decreases the amount of ACTH released from the anterior pituitary gland.

Strictly, Cushing&#x27;s syndrome refers to excess cortisol of any etiology (as syndrome means a group of symptoms). One of the causes of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome is a cortisol-secreting adenoma in the cortex of the adrenal gland (primary hypercortisolism/hypercorticism). The adenoma causes cortisol levels in the blood to be very high, and negative feedback on the pituitary from the high cortisol levels causes ACTH levels to be very low.

Cushing&#x27;s disease refers only to hypercortisolism secondary to excess production of ACTH from a corticotroph pituitary adenoma (secondary hypercortisolism/hypercorticism) or due to excess production of hypothalamus CRH (Corticotropin releasing hormone) (tertiary hypercortisolism/hypercorticism). This causes the blood ACTH levels to be elevated along with cortisol from the adrenal gland. The ACTH levels remain high because the tumor is unresponsive to negative feedback from high cortisol levels.

When Cushing&#x27;s syndrome is due to extra ACTH it is known as ectopic Cushing syndrome. This may be seen in a paraneoplastic syndrome.

When Cushing&#x27;s syndrome is suspected, either a dexamethasone suppression test (administration of dexamethasone and frequent determination of cortisol and ACTH level), or a 24-hour urinary measurement for cortisol offers equal detection rates. Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid and simulates the effects of cortisol, including negative feedback on the pituitary gland. When dexamethasone is administered and a blood sample is tested, cortisol levels &gt;50 nmol/L (1.81 μg/dL) would be indicative of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome because an ectopic source of cortisol or ACTH (such as adrenal adenoma) exists which is not inhibited by the dexamethasone. A novel approach, recently cleared by the US FDA, is sampling cortisol in saliva over 24 hours, which may be equally sensitive, as late-night levels of salivary cortisol are high in cushingoid patients. Other pituitary hormone levels may need to be ascertained. Performing a physical examination to determine any visual field defect may be necessary if a pituitary lesion is suspected, which may compress the optic chiasm, causing typical bitemporal hemianopia.

When any of these tests is positive, CT scanning of the adrenal gland and MRI of the pituitary gland are performed to detect the presence of any adrenal or pituitary adenomas or incidentalomas (the incidental discovery of harmless lesions). Scintigraphy of the adrenal gland with iodocholesterol scan is occasionally necessary. Occasionally, determining the ACTH levels in various veins in the body by venous catheterization, working towards the pituitary (petrosal sinus sampling) is necessary. In many cases, the tumors causing Cushing&#x27;s disease are less than 2 mm in size and difficult to detect using MRI or CT imaging. In one study of 261 patients with confirmed pituitary Cushing&#x27;s disease, only 48% of pituitary lesions were identified using MRI prior to surgery.

Plasma CRH levels are inadequate at diagnosis (with the possible exception of tumors secreting CRH) because of peripheral dilution and binding to CRHBP.

==Diagnosis==
The 24-hour urine-free cortisol test, the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test, and the measurement of midnight plasma cortisol or late-night salivary cortisol are the three primary tests used to diagnose Cushing&#x27;s syndrome.

Hypercortisolism is related with routine chemistry abnormalities such as neutrophilic leucocytosis, hyperglycemia, hypokalaemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypercoagulability.

Urinary cortisol levels directly reflect circulating free cortisol. Excess cortisol saturates binding proteins and is eliminated in urine as free cortisol, making it a helpful diagnostic for hypercortisolemia. Values four times higher than the top range of normal are uncommon, especially in Cushing&#x27;s disease. A single measurement lacks sensitivity for people with intermittent hypercortisolemia.

==Treatment==
Most cases of Cushingoid symptoms are caused by corticosteroid medications, such as those used for asthma, arthritis, eczema and other inflammatory conditions. Consequently, most patients are effectively treated by carefully tapering off (and eventually stopping) the medication that causes the symptoms.

If an adrenal adenoma is identified, it may be removed by surgery. An ACTH-secreting corticotrophic pituitary adenoma should be removed after diagnosis. Regardless of the adenoma&#x27;s location, most patients require steroid replacement postoperatively at least in the interim, as long-term suppression of pituitary ACTH and normal adrenal tissue does not recover immediately. Clearly, if both adrenals are removed, replacement with hydrocortisone or prednisolone is imperative.

In those patients not suited for or unwilling to undergo surgery, several drugs have been found to inhibit cortisol synthesis (e.g. ketoconazole, metyrapone) but they are of limited efficacy. Mifepristone is a powerful glucocorticoid type II receptor antagonist and, since it does not interfere with normal cortisol homeostasis type I receptor transmission, may be especially useful for treating the cognitive effects of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome. However, the medication faces considerable controversy due to its use as an abortifacient. In February 2012, the FDA approved mifepristone to control high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) in adult patients who are not candidates for surgery, or who did not respond to prior surgery, with the warning that mifepristone should never be used by pregnant women—although pregnancy is extremely rare during the course of Cushing&#x27;s Syndrome. In March 2020, Isturisa (osilodrostat) oral tablets a 11-beta-hydroxylase enzyme inhibitor was approved by FDA for treating those patients who cannot undergo pituitary surgery or for patients who underwent surgery but continue to have the disease.

Removal of the adrenals in the absence of a known tumor is occasionally performed to eliminate the production of excess cortisol. In some occasions, this removes negative feedback from a previously occult pituitary adenoma, which starts growing rapidly and produces extreme levels of ACTH, leading to hyperpigmentation. This clinical situation is known as Nelson&#x27;s syndrome.

==Epidemiology==
Cushing&#x27;s syndrome caused by treatment with corticosteroids is the most common form. Cushing&#x27;s disease is rare; a Danish study found an incidence of less than one case per million people per year. However, asymptomatic microadenomas (less than 10 mm in size) of the pituitary are found in about one in six individuals.

About 0.9 to 1% of those with Cushing&#x27;s syndrome have a tendency to develop venous thrombosis. Other factors such as surgery and obesity also increase the chance of getting thrombosis.

==Persons known with Cushing&#x27;s==
In February 2024, Amy Schumer announced that she had been diagnosed with Cushing&#x27;s syndrome.

<doc id="92374" wikidata="Q247237" url="?curid=92374" title="Autechre">
<text>Autechre () are an English electronic music duo consisting of Rob Brown and Sean Booth, both from Rochdale, Greater Manchester. Formed in 1987, they are among the best known acts signed to UK electronic label Warp Records, through which all of Autechre&#x27;s full-length albums have been released beginning with their 1993 debut &quot;Incunabula&quot;. They gained initial recognition when they were featured on Warp&#x27;s 1992 compilation &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;.

Influenced by styles such as 1980s electro and hip-hop, the music of Autechre has evolved throughout their career from early, melodic techno recordings to later works often considered abstract and experimental, featuring complex composition and few stylistic conventions. Their work has been associated with the 1990s electronic genre known as intelligent dance music (IDM), though Booth has dismissed the label as &quot;silly.&quot;

==History==
===Early years (1987–1992)===
Brown and Booth met through Manchester&#x27;s graffiti scene in 1987 when they both lived in Rochdale. Heavily influenced by electro-funk, hip-hop and acid house, they began trading mixtapes and then creating their own compositions while collecting a handful of cheap equipment, most notably a Casio SK-1 sampler and a Roland TR-606 drum machine. Their first release was &quot;Lego Feet&quot;, a 12&quot; recorded under an alias of the same name brought out by Manchester&#x27;s Skam Records.

Their first release as Autechre was the single &quot;Cavity Job&quot; in 1991, released on Hardcore Records. Booth and Brown pronounce the name Autechre with a Rochdale accent ( ). However, they have explained that the name can be pronounced in any way one sees fit. Booth said: &quot;The first two letters were intentional, because there was an &#x27;au&#x27; sound in the track, and the rest of the letters were bashed randomly on the keyboard. We had this track title for ages, and we had written it on a cassette, with some graphics. It looked good, and we began using it as our name.&quot;

Two more tracks appeared in 1992 under the now finalised Autechre name, on the Warp Records compilation &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;, part of the series of the same name. The compilation contained &quot;The Egg&quot;, later reworked for their first full-length release under the title &quot;Eggshell&quot;.

Two hours of early material was broadcast live on NTS Radio during Warp&#x27;s 30th-anniversary weekend, called &quot;Warp Tapes 89-93&quot;. It is distributed for free on Autechre&#x27;s Bleep Store in digital audio format.

===&quot;Incunabula&quot; and &quot;Amber&quot; (1993–1994)===
In 1993 Warp released their debut album, &quot;Incunabula&quot;, which became a surprise success, reaching the top of the UK Indie Chart. The album had a cool, calculated feel, with clear techno and electro roots, but also showed hints of the rhythmic flourishes and tuned percussion that would later become an important feature of their work. An EP of remixes of &quot;Incunabula&quot;″s &quot;Basscadet&quot; was released in 1994, with animated computer graphics for the Bcdtmx version created by Jess Scott-Hunter. This music video featured on MTV Europe&#x27;s Party Zone when Autechre were interviewed during the show in September that year. 1994 also saw the release of &quot;Amber&quot;, an album featuring a more ambient, less percussive approach than their debut.

The &quot;Anti EP&quot; was released shortly before &quot;Amber&quot; and is, as of yet, the only Autechre release to have an explicit purpose: it was a protest against the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which would prohibit raves, defined as any gathering of nine or more people where rave music is played. Rave music was defined as music which &quot;includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterized by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats&quot;. The record came wrapped in a seal, on which was printed a legal warning: &quot;Flutter has been programmed in such a way that no bars contain identical beats and can therefore be played at both forty-five and thirty-three revolutions under the proposed new law. However, we advise DJs to have a lawyer and musicologist present at all times to confirm the non-repetitive nature of the music in the event of police harassment.&quot;

In a 2008 interview with Pitchfork Media, Rob Brown mentioned that &quot;Incunabula&quot; and &quot;Amber&quot;, retrospectively, sounded &quot;cheesy&quot;. Brown later clarified that &quot;they were perhaps more simple, but not in a shit way.&quot;

===&quot;Tri Repetae&quot;, &quot;Chiastic Slide&quot; and &quot;LP5&quot; (1995–1999)===

1995 saw the release of &quot;Tri Repetae&quot;, their third album, as well as the EPs &quot;Anvil Vapre&quot; and &quot;Garbage&quot;, featuring a monochrome cover designed by The Designers Republic, with whom Autechre have long held a close association. &quot;Tri Repetae&quot; and its associated EPs were combined into a two disc set entitled &quot;Tri Repetae++&quot;, which was released in the United States. An official promotional video was created for &quot;Second Bad Vilbel&quot; from &quot;Anvil Vapre&quot; by English visual artist Chris Cunningham (his first). The &quot;Second Bad Vilbel&quot; video featured rapidly cut shots of industrial machinery and robotic movement, synchronised with the music. Cunningham later re-edited the video in 2002, following his disappointment with the original: &quot;It was intended to be completely abstract but it didn&#x27;t quite work out that way&quot;. A two track vinyl-only EP entitled &quot;We R Are Why&quot;, was available to buy during certain concerts and via mail order during 1996. Also in 1995, Autechre&#x27;s track &quot;Nonima&quot; was featured on &quot;Mind The Gap Volume 5&quot;, a Belgian compilation of electronic music.

Autechre released three records in 1997: the full-length &quot;Chiastic Slide&quot;, and the EPs &quot;Envane&quot; and &quot;Cichlisuite&quot; (pronounced &quot;sickly sweet&quot;). The latter EP consists of five remixed versions of &quot;Cichli&quot; from &quot;Chiastic Slide&quot;. &quot;Radio Mix&quot; was also released in 1997; a rare CD-only promotional recording, it contains an hour-long DJ mix of other artists&#x27; tracks, some of them remixed by Autechre, as well as a short interview edited sometimes to the point of incomprehensibility.

An untitled record (typically known as &quot;LP5&quot; or simply &quot;Autechre&quot;) followed in 1998. It has been seen as a transitional work, with Brown commenting in 2005 that &quot;a lot of people have cited it as a classic Autechre album because it bridges the gap between the guys who liked our old stuff and the guys who got propelled on to our new stuff.&quot;

1999 saw the release of their first Peel session EP, consisting of three tracks broadcast on John Peel&#x27;s show for BBC Radio 1 in October 1995, as well as a vinyl-only limited edition promotional EP entitled &quot;Splitrmx12&quot;. 1999 also saw &quot;EP7&quot;, which is classed by the group as an EP despite the CD version being over an hour in length.

===&quot;Confield&quot;, &quot;Draft 7.30&quot; and &quot;Untilted&quot; (2000–2007)===

The new millennium brought about a drastic change in Autechre&#x27;s style, demonstrated by &quot;Confield&quot; (2001) and &quot;Draft 7.30&quot; (2003), as well as the &quot;Gantz Graf&quot; EP (2002). The title track from &quot;Gantz Graf&quot; inspired an iconic video by British designer Alex Rutterford, featuring an object (or an agglomeration of objects) synchronised to the music as it morphs, pulsates, shakes and finally dissolves. Rutterford, who had previously created an unofficial video for the &quot;Tri Repetae&quot; track &quot;Eutow&quot; as part of the Channel 4 music programme &quot;Lo-Fi&quot; in 2001, claimed the idea for the &quot;Gantz Graf&quot; video came during one of his LSD trips. The second Autechre Peel session EP was also released in 2002, containing four tracks broadcast in 1999, named by John Peel himself. Autechre released three collaborative albums with Andrew M. McKenzie&#x27;s Hafler Trio collective during the following five years (see collaborations).

Metacritic rated the critical reviews to &quot;Confield&quot; as &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. According to Sean Booth, &quot;most of &quot;Confield&quot; came out of experiments with Max that weren&#x27;t really applicable in a club environment.&quot; In contrast, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Draft 7.30&quot; was seen by some as an easier record to grasp. Booth stated in an interview around the release of &quot;Draft 7.30&quot; that &quot;[rhythm] doesn&#x27;t seem to limit us in the way it did when we first started. Now I think we just get it, we&#x27;re totally fluent in it and can be more expressive.&quot;

&quot;Untilted&quot; (a play on the word &quot;untitled&quot;), the duo&#x27;s eighth album, was released in 2005. It roughly continued the sound of their previous two LPs, though featured compositions that mutated greatly during their duration, typically alternating between passages of ambience and heavily processed, precise beats, such as on &quot;Ipacial Section&quot;. Its final track, &quot;Sublimit&quot;, is at almost sixteen minutes; Autechre&#x27;s longest composition to feature on any of their albums until 2016&#x27;s &quot;elseq 1–5&quot;. The release of &quot;Untilted&quot; was followed by a two-month tour that took the group around Europe, America and Japan, but withdrew them from studio work for an unusual length of time. The outcome of this, coupled with a forced change in studio setup, was a gap of three years between releases, longer than ever before.
===&quot;Quaristice&quot;, &quot;Oversteps&quot; and &quot;Exai&quot; (2008–2013)===
Their ninth album, &quot;Quaristice&quot;, was released in early 2008. In contrast to &quot;Untilted&quot;, it is made up of twenty tracks, more than any other Autechre release, each typically around 2 to 5 minutes in length. The download-only &quot;Quaristice.Quadrange.ep.ae&quot; EP that accompanies it (as well as the &quot;Versions&quot; bonus disc and three tracks released exclusively through the Japanese iTunes Store) brings the total length of music released during their &quot;Quaristice&quot; era to over five hours. Among this is the hour-long &quot;Perlence subrange 6-36&quot; that closes the EP. Each track on &quot;Quaristice&quot; was edited down from lengthy improvised sessions between Booth and Brown, some of which were released in longer versions on &quot;Quaristice.Quadrange.ep.ae&quot;. Although Sean Booth has stated that the FLAC release of &quot;Quaristice&quot; is the actual product, the album was also released by Warp Records as a double LP and a single CD as well as an elaborate two CD edition by Warp Records. Limited to only 1,000 copies, and containing both the regular album and &quot;Quaristice (Versions)&quot;, this special edition was packaged in a photo-etched steel case. It sold out within 12 hours of being announced.

On 13 January 2010, Warp Records announced &quot;Oversteps&quot;, Autechre&#x27;s tenth album. Originally slated to be released in March, it was released a month early in digital form on Bleep.com to those who preordered it; the CD and deluxe vinyl editions were released on 22 March 2010. A two-month European tour occurred in support of the album, followed by limited shows in Japan and Australia, the latter breaking a 15-year absence. Autechre then compiled a mix for the magazine &quot;FACT&quot;, released in February of the same year, that consisted of tracks by artists such as J Dilla and Necrophagist. On 25 May 2010, Warp Records announced the ten track &quot;Move of Ten&quot;, an EP by the duo in conjunction with the release of &quot;Oversteps&quot;. The digipack CD and the two 12&quot; vinyl version, as well as a digital download, was released on 12 July 2010.

In April 2011 a boxset of EPs entitled &quot;EPs 1991 – 2002&quot; (excluding &quot;Move of Ten&quot;) was released, with artwork from the Designers Republic. It includes a CD copy of their debut EP, &quot;Cavity Job&quot;, the first time it has been released on the format. In 2011 as part of Warp&#x27;s &#x27;Made in Japan&#x27; relief concert for the victims of the 2011 Sendai earthquake, an eleven-minute piece was released entitled &quot;6852&quot;, possibly part of a previous live recording.

The eleventh studio album entitled &quot;Exai&quot; was released on 5 March 2013, having been available for download from the official website as of 14 February 2013. The duo announced their 14th EP &quot;L-Event&quot; on 17 September 2013, which was released on 28 October 2013.

===&quot;AENA&quot; tour, &quot;AE_LIVE&quot;, &quot;elseq 1–5,&quot; &quot;NTS Sessions&quot; (2014–2019)===
During 2015, the duo embarked on a tour across North America, marketed as AENA. The tour was officially announced on the Warp Records website on 25 May 2015 but promotional material (specifically the logos for the upcoming tour) can be found that was released on 13 August 2014. On 29 October 2015 members of the Autechre mailing list were given invite-only permission to download a live recording from the duo titled &quot;&quot;, a collection of four one-hour-long soundboard recordings of a series of concerts that took place in 2014. On 1 November 2015 a Bleep.com substore opened up giving the public the ability to purchase and download the collection.

On 13 May 2016 a new Autechre track by the title of &quot;feed1&quot; was played on Tom Ravenscroft&#x27;s late evening show on BBC 6 Music after an announcement made on the Warp Records Twitter feed which was accompanied by a piece of geometric album art. On 18 May 2016 a second new track was played on KSUA, an Alaskan student radio station, again announced in a tweet by Warp. Afterwards, Warp released the snippet of the Autechre song on their Soundcloud account under the title &quot;c16 deep tread&quot;. On 19 May 2016, their twelfth studio album, &quot;elseq 1-5&quot;, on Autechre&#x27;s AE_STORE_ page. Warp Records have stated that there are no plans to release the album on a physical medium, making the album Autechre&#x27;s first digital-only studio album release.

On 6 April 2018, a livestream of new material was broadcast on NTS Radio, marking the first of four live streams released every week of the month. On 9 April 2018, it was unveiled that the sessions, totalling eight hours of material, would be packaged and released as &quot;NTS Sessions 1–4&quot; with a listing on the AE_STORE, including 12xLP and 8xCD boxsets. The livestreams coincided with the announcement of live sets in Japan and Australia, including their first-ever performance in Tasmania at the Dark Mofo Festival.

In November 2018, Richard Devine joined the user chat room of the electronic music forum We Are The Music Makers and hinted at an easter egg on the AE_STORE website. Following a partially hidden link, the user could download instrument parameter files for Elektron&#x27;s hardware which Autechre used for the 2008 Quaristice tour. When loaded into a Monomachine or Machinedrum these files allowed the user to create their own Quaristice tour soundboard.

===&quot;Sign&quot;, &quot;Plus&quot; and &quot;AE_2022–&quot; (2020–present)===
In April 2020, Autechre released &quot;AE LIVE 2016/2018&quot;, a set of tour recordings from those respective years. On 1 September 2020, Warp Records announced that fans should sign up to the Autechre mailing list. Shortly after, Autechre announced their next album, &quot;Sign&quot;, which was released on 16 October 2020.

In 2020 interviews, the duo stated that they had been recording material for &quot;Sign&quot; since the summer of 2018, after their Australian tour, up to February that year. Booth remarked that the songs were more emotional than other works, and that this was the first album recorded with their revamped systems.

Another album titled &quot;Plus&quot; was surprise released digitally on 28 October, with physical and streaming releases planned on 20 November.

On 10 August 2023, the duo released a compilation of live soundboard recordings titled &quot;AE_LIVE 2022–&quot;, which consisted of 7 recordings, all between 60 and 80 minutes in length. On 4 November 2024, the release was renamed to &quot;AE_2022–&quot; and included a new batch of 12 new recordings from their 2023 and 2024 performances. The &quot;live&quot; label was dropped from the new release; in an interview with &quot;Metal&quot;, Booth stated that &quot;I&#x27;m honestly not that interested in records anymore. The concept of what a studio album is seems outdated.&quot;

On 9 December 2024 Autechre were announced to become BBC Radio 6&#x27;s artists in residence. The duo were confirmed to be playing a 1 hour long set every night from 9 December through to 12 December.

==Influences==
A wide variety of influences have been noted as discernible in Autechre&#x27;s music. The duo&#x27;s roots in tagging, early hip-hop and electro music, and b-boy culture in general are still evident, with many reviews noting hip-hop rhythms—sometimes heavily obscured or processed, and sometimes explicit even in later work. All of Autechre&#x27;s live webcasts have featured large amounts of early hip-hop and electro. In a review of &quot;Oversteps&quot;, &quot;The Wire&quot; noted &quot;Treale&quot; as being &quot;a reminder of Booth and Brown&#x27;s musical apprenticeship as teenage B-boys&quot;. 

As Autechre&#x27;s music and studio setup evolved, reviews started to note influences from farther afield; experiments in generative synthesis, musique concrète and FM synthesis drew comparisons with Iannis Xenakis, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Bernard Parmegiani from critics such as Paul Morley. The group have mentioned musique concrète composers Tod Dockstader and Edgard Varèse as influences. Autechre also cite Coil as a major influence, with an unfinished collaboration of unknown completeness occurring around the release of &quot;LP5&quot; and &quot;EP7&quot;. Chris Richards of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated in 2015 that Autechre create &quot;some of the most complicated music you could ever hope to drown in&quot; and are &quot;recognized as pioneers in experimental music&quot;. Autechre&#x27;s work has been described as &quot;music that sounds like it designed itself, with audio fractals that change constantly like living organisms.&quot;

==Recording==
Booth and Brown record tracks collaboratively, but in separate studios with identical software and equipment. The process, as Booth describes in a 2020 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, involves one sending a track to another, which is sent back with revisions before it is deemed finished. Brown remarks that, although they &quot;behave differently, we sometimes try to achieve the same goal, but with greatly differing approaches (as) we really do get off on the fact that we&#x27;re on the same page most of the time.&quot;

===Equipment===
Autechre use many different digital synths and a few analogue synths in their production, as well as analogue and digital drum machines, such as the Roland R-8, mixers, effects units and samplers. They have also made extensive use of a variety of computer based sequencers, software synthesisers, and other applications as a means of controlling those synths and processing the synthesised sounds. Much of the hardware and software they use has been customised by the band themselves. Autechre have also experimented in depth with development environments such as Max/MSP, and Kyma, amongst others, from 1997 onwards. From 2005 until 2009, they have used the Elektron Machinedrum and Monomachine, alongside Akai MPC and Nord Modular in their live performances. It has also been rumoured that Autechre have used military equipment in their work. In 2008, Sean Booth reported that if he were locked in a cell for a year with only one piece of software and one piece of hardware, he&#x27;d &quot;probably take a copy of Digital Performer and an AKG C1000 microphone.&quot;

Other machines that Autechre have repeatedly mentioned in interviews are appreciated for their interface and aesthetics as much as their sound, including the Roland TR-606 and MC-202, and the Nord Lead. According to the 2016 interview to Resident Advisor, both members haven&#x27;t bought a piece of equipment &quot;in the last 5 years&quot;, making Max/MSP a primary production method, with Sean Booth stating that &quot;in Max I can generally build the thing I need, and if I don&#x27;t know how to do that it&#x27;ll generally be worthwhile learning.&quot; Booth said that they use MAX as MIDI &quot;only handles a limited set of information&quot; and that instruments like the piano &quot;separates the artist from the string.&quot;

===Collaborations, remixes and covers===
Both Booth and Brown are known to have been heavily involved with the majority of releases by the mysterious Gescom collective, although Booth admitted in an interview that around 20 to 30 musicians overall are connected with what he describes as an &quot;umbrella project&quot;. Three elaborately packaged albums (&quot;æ³o &amp; h³æ&quot;, &quot;æo³ &amp; ³hæ&quot;, and &quot;ha³oe &amp; ah³eo&quot;) have been made by Autechre in collaboration with Andrew M. McKenzie&#x27;s ongoing Hafler Trio project. These albums are significantly more minimal than any other Autechre release, featuring dense, claustrophobic and noisy drones. A track called &quot;Elephant Gear&quot;, credited to both Autechre and Canadian breakcore musician Venetian Snares under the alias AEVSVS, was released on a compilation in tribute to Elektron co-founder Daniel Hansson, who died in a car accident. Autechre have collaborated with several artists for live performances, including Zoviet France, Fennesz and Roedelius. &quot;3. Telepathics Meh In-Sect Connection&quot;, an album by Sean Booth in collaboration with Mika Vainio of Pan Sonic and Kouhei Matsunaga, was released in early 2010.

In 2009 they contributed a cover of an LFO song to the &quot;Warp20&quot; compilation, as well as having their song &quot;Tilapia&quot; covered by John Callaghan.

The compilation CD &quot;The Only Blip Hop Record You Will Ever Need, Vol. 1&quot;, issued in 2002 by David Byrne&#x27;s Luaka Bop Records, contains a cover version of &quot;Gnit&quot; performed by Marie + Scratch. It is performed using only human voice samples.

The band Pink Freud has performed covers of several Autechre numbers, including &quot;Basscadet&quot;, &quot;Cichli&quot; and &quot;Bike&quot;. These live performances are available on YouTube.

Autechre helped initiate the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties music festival in 2000, and curated the 2003 festival.

===Radio===
Autechre have been involved with radio since their early days, originally spinning for IBC Radio, a Manchester pirate radio station in 1991, where they had their own show playing Belgian techno alongside their own demos. Later they would appear as part of Gescom for their weekly &quot;Disengage&quot; show on Manchester&#x27;s Kiss FM.

Booth and Brown are also known to have contributed (anonymously) to a weekly pirate radio show which aired live at midnight Saturday night in Sheffield from 1994–95, hosted by DJ Jez Potter (who went on to found the noted &#x27;Fear of a Crap Planet&#x27; club night in Brighton) alongside fellow Sheffield residents Robert E. Baker, Mark Fell and Mat Steel. No official recordings of these sometimes particularly lengthy broadcasts, often extending to many hours—which featured the above named artists performing using vinyl, tape, CDs, MiniDisc, as well as various hard-and-software—are known to exist.

===Webcasts===
Autechre have streamed exceptionally long live DJ mixes as webcasts to coincide with the release of four albums so far:
* A nearly nine-hour live mix on 10–11 April 2005 (GMT) to coincide with the release of &quot;Untilted&quot;
* A twelve-hour live stream on 23–24 February 2008 to coincide with the release of &quot;Quaristice&quot;
* A twelve-and-a-half-hour live stream spanning 6pm to 6:30am (GMT) on 2–3 March 2010 to coincide with the release of &quot;Oversteps&quot;
* Two separate ten-hour live streams from 8pm to 6am (GMT) on 2–3 March 2013 to coincide with the release of &quot;Exai&quot;
* A 12-hour mix via radio-streaming platform Mixlr on 13 October 2019
* A broadcast of &quot;Sign&quot; on 8 October to the Autechre website
* A 5½-hour-long mix on Mixlr streamed on 30 December 2022
* A 2¼-hour-long &quot;Mix for Neuvoids&quot; released on 20 June 2023 to SoundCloud for the Neuvoids label.

<text>An electromagnet is a type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by an electric current. Electromagnets usually consist of wire (likely copper) wound into a coil. A current through the wire creates a magnetic field which is concentrated along the center of the coil. The magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off. The wire turns are often wound around a magnetic core made from a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material such as iron; the magnetic core concentrates the magnetic flux and makes a more powerful magnet.

The main advantage of an electromagnet over a permanent magnet is that the magnetic field can be quickly changed by controlling the amount of electric current in the winding. However, unlike a permanent magnet, which needs no power, an electromagnet requires a continuous supply of current to maintain the magnetic field.

Electromagnets are widely used as components of other electrical devices, such as motors, generators, electromechanical solenoids, relays, loudspeakers, hard disks, MRI machines, scientific instruments, and magnetic separation equipment. Electromagnets are also employed in industry for picking up and moving heavy iron objects such as scrap iron and steel.

== History ==
Danish scientist Hans Christian Ørsted discovered in 1820 that electric currents create magnetic fields. In the same year, the French scientist André-Marie Ampère showed that iron can be magnetized by inserting it into an electrically fed solenoid.

British scientist William Sturgeon invented the electromagnet in 1824.
 His first electromagnet was a horseshoe-shaped piece of iron that was wrapped with about 18 turns of bare copper wire. (Insulated wire did not then exist.) The iron was varnished to insulate it from the windings. When a current was passed through the coil, the iron became magnetized and attracted other pieces of iron; when the current was stopped, it lost magnetization. Sturgeon displayed its power by showing that although it only weighed seven ounces (roughly 200 grams), it could lift nine pounds (roughly 4 kilos) when the current of a single-cell power supply was applied. However, Sturgeon&#x27;s magnets were weak because the uninsulated wire he used could only be wrapped in a single spaced-out layer around the core, limiting the number of turns.

Beginning in 1830, US scientist Joseph Henry systematically improved and popularised the electromagnet. By using wire insulated by silk thread and inspired by Schweigger&#x27;s use of multiple turns of wire to make a galvanometer, he was able to wind multiple layers of wire onto cores, creating powerful magnets with thousands of turns of wire, including one that could support . The first major use for electromagnets was in telegraph sounders.

The magnetic domain theory of how ferromagnetic cores work was first proposed in 1906 by French physicist Pierre-Ernest Weiss, and the detailed modern quantum mechanical theory of ferromagnetism was worked out in the 1920s by Werner Heisenberg, Lev Landau, Felix Bloch, and others.

== Applications of electromagnets ==
A &quot;portative electromagnet&quot; is one designed to just hold material in place; an example is a lifting magnet. A &quot;tractive electromagnet&quot; applies a force and moves something.

Electromagnets are very widely used in electric and electromechanical devices, including:
* Motors and generators
* Transformers
* Relays
* Electric bells and buzzers
* Loudspeakers and headphones
* Actuators such as valves
* Magnetic recording and data storage equipment: tape recorders, VCRs, hard disks
* MRI machines
* Scientific equipment such as mass spectrometers
* Particle accelerators
* Magnetic locks
* Magnetic separation equipment used for separating magnetic from nonmagnetic material; for example, separating ferrous metal in scrap
* Industrial lifting magnets
* Magnetic levitation, used in maglev trains
* Induction heating for cooking, manufacturing, and hyperthermia therapy


==Simple solenoid==


A common tractive electromagnet is a uniformly wound solenoid and plunger. The solenoid is a coil of wire, and the plunger is made of a material such as soft iron. Applying a current to the solenoid applies a force to the plunger and may make it move. The plunger stops moving when the forces upon it are balanced. For example, the forces are balanced when the plunger is centered in the solenoid.

The maximum uniform pull happens when one end of the plunger is at the middle of the solenoid. An approximation for the force is

where is a proportionality constant, is the cross-sectional area of the plunger, is the number of turns in the solenoid, is the current through the solenoid wire, and is the length of the solenoid. For long, slender, solenoids (in units using inches, pounds force, and amperes), the value of is around 0.009 to 0.010 psi (maximum pull pounds per square inch of plunger cross-sectional area). For example, a 12-inch-long coil () with a long plunger with a cross section of one inch square () and 11,200 ampere-turns () had a maximum pull of 8.75 pounds (corresponding to ).

The maximum pull is increased when a magnetic stop is inserted into the solenoid. The stop becomes a magnet that will attract the plunger; it adds little to the solenoid pull when the plunger is far away but dramatically increases the pull when the plunger is close. An approximation for the pull is
:formula_1
Here is the distance between the end of the stop and the end of the plunger. The additional constant for units of inches, pounds, and amperes with slender solenoids is about 2660. The first term inside the bracket represents the attraction between the stop and the plunger; the second term represents the same force as the solenoid without a stop ().

Some improvements can be made on this basic design. The ends of the stop and plunger are often conical. For example, the plunger may have a pointed end that fits into a matching recess in the stop. The shape makes the solenoid&#x27;s pull more uniform as a function of separation. Another improvement is to add a magnetic return path around the outside of the solenoid (an &quot;iron-clad solenoid&quot;). The magnetic return path, just as the stop, has little impact until the air gap is small.

== Physics ==

An electric current flowing in a wire creates a magnetic field around the wire, due to Ampere&#x27;s law &quot;(see drawing of wire with magnetic field)&quot;. To concentrate the magnetic field in an electromagnet, the wire is wound into a coil with many turns of wire lying side-by-side. The magnetic field of all the turns of wire passes through the center of the coil, creating a strong magnetic field there. A coil forming the shape of a straight tube (a helix) is called a solenoid.

The direction of the magnetic field through a coil of wire can be determined by the right-hand rule. If the fingers of the right hand are curled around the coil in the direction of current flow (conventional current, flow of positive charge) through the windings, the thumb points in the direction of the field inside the coil. The side of the magnet that the field lines emerge from is defined to be the &quot;north pole&quot;.

=== Magnetic core ===
For definitions of the variables below, see box at end of article.

Much stronger magnetic fields can be produced if a magnetic core, made of a soft ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) material such as iron, is placed inside the coil. A core can increase the magnetic field to thousands of times the strength of the field of the coil alone, due to the high magnetic permeability formula_2 of the material. Not all electromagnets use cores, so this is called a &quot;ferromagnetic-core&quot; or &quot;iron-core&quot; electromagnet.

This phenomenon occurs because the magnetic core&#x27;s material (often iron or steel) is composed of small regions called magnetic domains that act like tiny magnets (see ferromagnetism). Before the current in the electromagnet is turned on, these domains point in random directions, so their tiny magnetic fields cancel each other out, and the core has no large-scale magnetic field. When a current passes through the wire wrapped around the core, its magnetic field penetrates the core and turns the domains to align in parallel with the field. As they align, all their tiny magnetic fields add to the wire&#x27;s field, which creates a large magnetic field that extends into the space around the magnet. The core concentrates the field, and the magnetic field passes through the core in lower reluctance than it would when passing through air.

The larger the current passed through the wire coil, the more the domains align, and the stronger the magnetic field is. Once all the domains are aligned, any additional current only causes a slight increase in the strength of the magnetic field. Eventually, the field strength levels off and becomes nearly constant, regardless of how much current is sent through the windings. This phenomenon is called saturation, and is the main nonlinear feature of ferromagnetic materials. For most high-permeability core steels, the maximum possible strength of the magnetic field is around 1.6 to 2 teslas (T). This is why the very strongest electromagnets, such as superconducting and very high current electromagnets, cannot use cores.

When the current in the coil is turned off, most of the domains in the core material lose alignment and return to a random state, and the electromagnetic field disappears. However, some of the alignment persists because the domains resist turning their direction of magnetization, which leaves the core magnetized as a weak permanent magnet. This phenomenon is called hysteresis and the remaining magnetic field is called remanent magnetism. The residual magnetization of the core can be removed by degaussing. In alternating current electromagnets, such as those used in motors, the core&#x27;s magnetization is constantly reversed, and the remanence contributes to the motor&#x27;s losses.

===Ampere&#x27;s law===
The magnetic field of electromagnets in the general case is given by Ampere&#x27;s Law:

:formula_3

which says that the integral of the magnetizing field formula_4 around any closed loop is equal to the sum of the current flowing through the loop. A related equation is the Biot–Savart law, which gives the magnetic field due to each small segment of current.

=== Force exerted by magnetic field ===
Likewise, on the solenoid, the force exerted by an electromagnet on a conductor located at a section of core material is:
This equation can be derived from the energy stored in a magnetic field. Energy is force times distance. Rearranging terms yields the equation above.

The 1.6 T limit on the field previously mentioned sets a limit on the maximum force per unit core area, or magnetic pressure, an iron-core electromagnet can exert; roughly:

:formula_5

for the core&#x27;s saturation limit, formula_6. In more intuitive units, it is useful to remember that at 1 T the magnetic pressure is approximately .

Given a core geometry, the magnetic field needed for a given force can be calculated from (); if the result is much more than 1.6 T, a larger core must be used. 

However, computing the magnetic field and force exerted by ferromagnetic materials in general is difficult for two reasons. First, the strength of the field varies from point to point in a complicated way, particularly outside the core and in air gaps, where &quot;fringing fields&quot; and &quot;leakage flux&quot; must be considered. Second, the magnetic field and force are nonlinear functions of the current, depending on the nonlinear relation between formula_7 and formula_4 for the particular core material used. For precise calculations, computer programs that can produce a model of the magnetic field using the finite element method are employed.

=== Magnetic circuit ===
In many practical applications of electromagnets, such as motors, generators, transformers, lifting magnets, and loudspeakers, the iron core is in the form of a loop or magnetic circuit, possibly broken by a few narrow air gaps. Iron presents much less &quot;resistance&quot; (reluctance) to the magnetic field than air, so a stronger field can be obtained if most of the magnetic field&#x27;s path is within the core. Since the magnetic field lines are closed loops, the core is usually made in the form of a loop.

Since most of the magnetic field is confined within the outlines of the core loop, this allows a simplification of the mathematical analysis. A common simplifying assumption satisfied by many electromagnets, which will be used in this section, is that the magnetic field strength &quot;formula_7&quot; is constant around the magnetic circuit (within the core and air gaps) and zero outside it. Most of the magnetic field will be concentrated in the core material (&quot;C&quot;) (see Fig. 1). Within the core, the magnetic field (&quot;B&quot;) will be approximately uniform across any cross-section; if the core also has roughly constant area throughout its length, the field in the core will be constant.

At any air gaps (&quot;G&quot;) between core sections, the magnetic field lines are no longer confined by the core. Here, they bulge out beyond the core geometry over the length of the gap, reducing the field strength in the gap. The &quot;bulges&quot; (&quot;BF&quot;) are called fringing fields. However, as long as the length of the gap is smaller than the cross-section dimensions of the core, the field in the gap will be approximately the same as in the core.

In addition, some of the magnetic field lines (&quot;BL&quot;) will take &quot;short cuts&quot; and not pass through the entire core circuit, and thus will not contribute to the force exerted by the magnet. This also includes field lines that encircle the wire windings but do not enter the core. This is called leakage flux.

The equations in this section are valid for electromagnets for which:
# the magnetic circuit is a single loop of core material, possibly broken by a few air gaps;
# the core has roughly the same cross-sectional area throughout its length;
# any air gaps between sections of core material are not large compared with the cross-sectional dimensions of the core;
# there is negligible leakage flux.

==== Magnetic field in magnetic circuit ====
The magnetic field created by an electromagnet is proportional to both formula_10 and formula_11; their product, formula_12, is magnetomotive force. For an electromagnet with a single magnetic circuit, Ampere&#x27;s Law reduces to:

:formula_13
}{\mu} + \frac{L_{\mathrm{gap}}}{\mu_0} \right) &lt;/math&gt;|}}

This is a nonlinear equation, because the permeability of the core formula_2 varies with formula_7. For an exact solution, formula_16 must be obtained from the core material hysteresis curve. If formula_7 is unknown, the equation must be solved by numerical methods. 

However, if the magnetomotive force is well above saturation (so the core material is in saturation), the magnetic field will be approximately the material&#x27;s saturation value formula_6, and will not vary much with changes in formula_12. For a closed magnetic circuit (no air gap), most core materials saturate at a magnetomotive force of roughly 800 ampere-turns per meter of flux path.

For most core materials, the relative permeability formula_20. So in (), the second term dominates. Therefore, in magnetic circuits with an air gap, formula_7 depends strongly on the length of the air gap, and the length of the flux path in the core does not matter much. Given an air gap of 1mm, a magnetomotive force of about 796 ampere-turns is required to produce a magnetic field of 1 T.

==== Closed magnetic circuit ====
For a closed magnetic circuit (no air gap), such as would be found in an electromagnet lifting a piece of iron bridged across its poles, equation () becomes:

Substituting into (), the force is:

To maximize the force, a core with a short flux path &quot;formula_22&quot; and a wide cross-sectional area &quot;formula_23&quot; is preferred (this also applies to magnets with an air gap). To achieve this, in applications like lifting magnets and loudspeakers, a flat cylindrical design is often used. The winding is wrapped around a short wide cylindrical core that forms one pole, and a thick metal housing that wraps around the outside of the windings forms the other part of the magnetic circuit, bringing the magnetic field to the front to form the other pole.

=== Force between electromagnets ===
The previous methods are applicable to electromagnets with a magnetic circuit; however, they do not apply when a large part of the magnetic field path is outside the core. (A non-circuit example would be a magnet with a straight cylindrical core.) To determine the force between two electromagnets (or permanent magnets) in these cases, a special analogy called a &quot;magnetic-charge model&quot; can be used. In this model, it is assumed that the magnets have well-defined &quot;poles&quot; where the field lines emerge from the core, and that the magnetic field is produced by fictitious &quot;magnetic charges&quot; on the surface of the poles. This model assumes point-like poles (instead of surfaces), and thus it only yields a good approximation when the distance between the magnets is much larger than their diameter; thus, it is useful just for determining a force between them.

The magnetic pole strength &quot;formula_24&quot; of an electromagnet is given by
formula_25
and thus the force between two poles is
formula_26
Each electromagnet has two poles, so the total force on magnet 1 from magnet 2 is equal to the vector sum of the forces of magnet 2&#x27;s poles acting on each pole of magnet 1.

==Side effects==
There are several side effects which occur in electromagnets, which must be considered in their design. These effects generally become more significant in larger electromagnets.

===Ohmic heating===
The only power consumed in a direct current (DC) electromagnet under steady-state conditions is due to the resistance of the windings, and is dissipated as heat. Some large electromagnets require water cooling systems in the windings to carry off the waste heat.

Since the magnetic field is proportional to the product formula_12, the number of turns in the windings formula_10 and the current formula_11 can be chosen to minimize heat losses, as long as their product is constant. Since the power dissipation, formula_30, increases with the square of the current but only increases approximately linearly with the number of windings, the power lost in the windings can be minimized by reducing formula_11 and proportionally increasing the number of turns formula_10, or using thicker wire to reduce the resistance. For example, halving formula_11 and doubling formula_10 halves the power loss, as does doubling the area of the wire. In either case, increasing the amount of wire reduces the ohmic losses. For this reason, electromagnet windings often have a significant thickness.

However, the limit to increasing formula_10 or lowering the resistance is that the windings take up more space between the magnet&#x27;s core pieces. If the area available for windings is filled up, adding more turns requires a smaller diameter of wire, which has higher resistance, and thus cancels the advantage of using more turns. So, in large magnets there is a minimum amount of heat loss that cannot be reduced. This increases with the square of the magnetic flux, formula_36.

===Inductive voltage spikes===
An electromagnet has significant inductance, and resists changes in the current through its windings. Any sudden changes in the winding current cause large voltage spikes across the windings. This is because when the current through the magnet is increased, such as when it is turned on, energy from the circuit must be stored in the magnetic field. When it is turned off, the energy in the field is returned to the circuit.

If an ordinary switch is used to control the winding current, this can cause sparks at the terminals of the switch. This does not occur when the magnet is switched on, because the limited supply voltage causes the current through the magnet and the field energy to increase slowly. But when it is switched off, the energy in the magnetic field is suddenly returned to the circuit, causing a large voltage spike and an arc across the switch contacts, which can damage them. With small electromagnets, a capacitor is sometimes used across the contacts, which reduces arcing by temporarily storing the current. More often, a diode is used to prevent voltage spikes by providing a path for the current to recirculate through the winding until the energy is dissipated as heat. The diode is connected across the winding, oriented so it is reverse-biased during steady state operation and does not conduct. When the supply voltage is removed, the voltage spike forward-biases the diode and the reactive current continues to flow through the winding, through the diode, and back into the winding. A diode used in this way is called a freewheeling diode or flyback diode.

Large electromagnets are usually powered by variable current electronic power supplies, controlled by a microprocessor, which prevent voltage spikes by accomplishing current changes slowly, in gentle ramps. It may take several minutes to energize or deenergize a large magnet.

===Lorentz forces===
In powerful electromagnets, the magnetic field exerts a force on each turn of the windings, due to the Lorentz force formula_37 acting on the moving charges within the wire. The Lorentz force is perpendicular to both the axis of the wire and the magnetic field. It can be visualized as a pressure between the magnetic field lines, pushing them apart. It has two effects on an electromagnet&#x27;s windings:
* The field lines within the axis of the coil exert a radial force on each turn of the windings, tending to push them outward in all directions. This causes a tensile stress in the wire.
* The leakage field lines between each turn of the coil exert an attractive force between adjacent turns, tending to pull them together.
The Lorentz forces increase with &quot;formula_36&quot;. In large electromagnets the windings must be firmly clamped in place, to prevent motion on power-up and power-down from causing metal fatigue in the windings. In the Bitter electromagnet design (Fig. 2), used in very high-field research magnets, the windings are constructed as flat disks to resist the radial forces, and clamped in an axial direction to resist the axial ones.

===Core losses===
In alternating current (AC) electromagnets, used in transformers, inductors, and AC motors and generators, the magnetic field is constantly changing. This causes energy losses in their magnetic cores, which is dissipated as heat in the core. The losses stem from two processes: eddy currents and hysteresis losses.

&quot;Eddy currents&quot;: From Faraday&#x27;s law of induction, a changing magnetic field induces circulating electric currents (eddy currents) inside nearby conductors. The energy in these currents is dissipated as heat in the electrical resistance of the conductor, so they are a cause of energy loss. Since the magnet&#x27;s iron core is conductive, and most of the magnetic field is concentrated there, eddy currents in the core are the major problem. Eddy currents are closed loops of current that flow in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field. The energy dissipated is proportional to the area enclosed by the loop. To prevent them, the cores of AC electromagnets are made of stacks of thin steel sheets, or laminations, oriented parallel to the magnetic field, with an insulating coating on the surface. The insulation layers prevent eddy current from flowing between the sheets. Any remaining eddy currents must flow within the cross-section of each individual lamination, which reduces losses greatly. Another alternative is to use a ferrite core, which is a nonconductor.

&quot;Hysteresis losses&quot;: Reversing the direction of magnetization of the magnetic domains in the core material each cycle causes energy loss, because of the coercivity of the material. These are called hysteresis losses. The energy lost per cycle is proportional to the area of the hysteresis loop in the &quot;formula_39&quot; graph. To minimize this loss, magnetic cores used in transformers and other AC electromagnets are made of &quot;soft&quot; low coercivity materials, such as silicon steel or soft ferrite. The energy loss per cycle of the alternating current is constant for each of these processes, so the power loss increases linearly with frequency.

== High-field electromagnets ==

=== Superconducting electromagnets ===

When a magnetic field higher than the ferromagnetic limit of 1.6 T is needed, superconducting electromagnets can be used. Instead of using ferromagnetic materials, these use superconducting windings cooled with liquid helium, which conduct current without electrical resistance. These allow enormous currents to flow, which generate intense magnetic fields. Superconducting magnets are limited by the field strength at which the winding material ceases to be superconducting. Current designs are limited to 10–20 T, with the current (2017) record of 32 T. The necessary refrigeration equipment and cryostat make them much more expensive than ordinary electromagnets. However, in high-power applications this can be offset by lower operating costs, since after startup no power is required for the windings, since no energy is lost to ohmic heating. They are used in particle accelerators and MRI machines.

=== Bitter electromagnets ===

Both iron-core and superconducting electromagnets have limits to the field they can produce. Therefore, the most powerful man-made magnetic fields have been generated by &quot;air-core&quot; non-superconducting electromagnets of a design invented by Francis Bitter in 1933, called Bitter electromagnets. Instead of wire windings, a Bitter magnet consists of a solenoid made of a stack of conducting disks, arranged so that the current moves in a helical path through them, with a hole through the center where the maximum field is created. This design has the mechanical strength to withstand the extreme Lorentz forces of the field, which increase with &quot;formula_36&quot;. The disks are pierced with holes through which cooling water passes to carry away the heat caused by the high current. The strongest continuous field achieved solely with a resistive magnet is 41.5 T , produced by a Bitter electromagnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida. The previous record was 37.5 T. The strongest continuous magnetic field overall, 45 T, was achieved in June 2000 with a hybrid device consisting of a Bitter magnet inside a superconducting magnet.

The factor that limits the strength of electromagnets is the inability to dissipate the enormous waste heat, so more powerful fields, up to 100 T, have been obtained from resistive magnets by sending brief pulses of high current through them; the inactive period after each pulse allows the heat produced during the pulse to be removed before the next pulse. 
=== Explosively pumped flux compression ===
The most powerful man-made magnetic fields have been created by using explosives to compress the magnetic field inside an electromagnet as it is pulsed; these are called explosively pumped flux compression generators. The implosion compresses the magnetic field to values of around 1,000 T for a few microseconds. While this method may seem very destructive, shaped charges redirect the blast outward to minimize harm to the experiment. These devices are known as &quot;destructive pulsed electromagnets&quot;. They are used in physics and materials science research to study the properties of materials at high magnetic fields.

<text>Hyperbaton , in its original meaning, is a figure of speech in which a phrase is made discontinuous by the insertion of other words. In modern usage, the term is also used more generally for figures of speech that transpose sentences&#x27; natural word order, which is also called anastrophe.

==Etymology==
The word is borrowed from the Greek &quot;hyperbaton&quot; (), meaning &quot;stepping over&quot;, which is derived from &quot;hyper&quot; (&quot;over&quot;) and &quot;bainein&quot; (&quot;to step&quot;), with the &quot;-tos&quot; verbal adjective suffix. The idea is that to understand the phrase, the reader has to &quot;step over&quot; the words inserted in between.

==Classical usage==
The separation of connected words for emphasis or effect is possible to a much greater degree in highly inflected languages, whose sentence meaning does not depend closely on word order. In Latin and Ancient Greek, the effect of hyperbaton is often to emphasize the first word. It has been called &quot;perhaps the most distinctively alien feature of Latin word order.&quot; Donatus, in his work &quot;On tropes&quot;, includes under hyperbaton five varieties: hysterologia, anastrophe (for which the term hyperbaton is sometimes used loosely as a synonym), parenthesis, tmesis, and synchysis.

===Ancient Greek===
* () (Demosthenes 18.158) 
:&quot;Greece has suffered such things at the hands of only one person&quot;

In the above example, the word &quot;(only) one&quot;, &quot;henos&quot;, occurs in its normal place after the preposition &quot;at the hands of&quot; (&quot;hupo&quot;), but &quot;person&quot; (&quot;anthrōpou&quot;) is unnaturally delayed, giving emphasis to &quot;only one.&quot;

* () (occurs several times in Euripides)
:&quot;[I entreat] you by your knees&quot;

Here the word &quot;you&quot; (&quot;se&quot;) divides the preposition &quot;by&quot; from its object &quot;knees.&quot;

* () (Plato, &quot;Republic&quot; 358b)
:&quot;What power does it have?&quot;

===New Testament Greek===
Hyperbaton is also common in New Testament Greek, for example:



In all these examples and others in the New Testament, the first word of the hyperbaton is an adjective or adverb which is emphasised by being separated from the following noun. The separating word can be a verb, noun, or pronoun.

===Latin===
====Prose====
In Latin hyperbaton is frequently found in both prose and verse. The following examples come from prose writers. Often, there is an implied contrast between the first word of the hyperbaton and its opposite:
*&quot;meo tu epistulam dedisti servo?&quot; (Plautus, &quot;Pseudolus&quot; 1203) 
:&quot;You gave the letter to &quot;my&quot; slave (i.e. not your own)?&quot;
*&quot;duas a te accepi epistulas heri&quot; (Cicero, &quot;Att.&quot;, 14.2.1) 
:&quot;I received &quot;two&quot; letters (&quot;duas epistulas&quot;) from you yesterday&quot; (not just one).
*&quot;hae permanserunt aquae dies complures.&quot; (Caesar, &quot;B.C.&quot; 1.50.1):
:&quot;This flood (&quot;hae aquae&quot;) lasted (&quot;permanserunt&quot;) several days&quot; (unlike the earlier one).
*&quot;ille sic dies&quot; (Cicero, &quot;Att.&quot; 5.1.3) 
:&quot;So (passed) &quot;that&quot; day (&quot;ille dies&quot;)&quot;

In all the above examples, the first word of the hyperbaton can be said to be emphasised. The following is different, since the emphasis seems to be on the word in the middle: 
*&quot;sum enim ipse mensus&quot; (Cicero, &quot;ad Quintum fratrem&quot;, 3.1.4)
:&quot;for I measured () it myself ()&quot;

In the following an adjective of size is brought to the front, emphasising the whole phrase:
*&quot;pro ingenti itaque victoria id fuit plebi.&quot; (Livy 4.54.6)
:&quot;The people saw this, therefore, as an enormous victory.&quot;
*&quot;magnam enim secum pecuniam portabat&quot; (Nepos, &quot;Hannibal&quot;, 9.2)
:&quot;for (&quot;enim&quot;) he was carrying a large sum of money (&quot;magnam pecuniam&quot;) with him (&quot;secum&quot;)&quot;.
*&quot;magno cum fremitu et clamore&quot; (Cicero, &quot;to Atticus&quot;, 2.19.2)
:&quot;with (&quot;cum&quot;) a great deal of roaring and shouting&quot;

The first word of the hyperbaton can also be an adverb, as in the following example:
*&quot;aeque vita iucunda&quot; (Cicero, &quot;de Finibus&quot; 4.30) 
:&quot;a life (&quot;vita&quot;) equally pleasant (&quot;aeque iucunda&quot;).

It is also possible for the noun to come first (&quot;postmodifier hyperbaton&quot;), as in the following:
*&quot;dies appetebat septimus&quot; (Caesar, &quot;B.G.&quot; 6.35.1)
:&quot;The seventh day was approaching&quot;

*&quot;Antonius legiones eduxit duas.&quot; (Cicero, &quot;ad Fam.&quot; 10.30.1)
:&quot;Antonius led out two legions.&quot;

A hyperbaton can also be used to demonstrate a kind of picture shown in the text:
* (Caesar, &quot;Bel. Gall.&quot; 5.30)
:&quot;With this dispute having been held favouring either side&quot; (showing the dispute being on either side of the accusative prepositional phrase)

Another kind of hyperbaton is &quot;genitive hyperbaton&quot; in which one of the words is in the genitive case:
*&quot;contionem advocat militum&quot; (Caesar, &quot;Bellum Civile&quot; 2.32)
:&quot;He called a meeting of the soldiers.&quot;

The following even have a double hyperbaton:
*&quot;cum ipse litteram Socrates nullam reliquisset.&quot; (Cicero, &quot;de Orat.&quot; 3.60)
:&quot;When Socrates himself didn&#x27;t leave a single line of writing.&quot;

* (Caesar, &quot;Bell. Gall.&quot; 5.29.7)
:&quot;their one (hope of) salvation rested in speed ()&quot; (with emphasis on &quot;one&quot; and &quot;speed&quot;)

*&quot;praeda potitus ingenti est&quot; (Livy 40.49.1)
:&quot;he took possession of an enormous amount of booty&quot;.

In the following, a genitive hyperbaton and an adjectival hyperbaton are interleaved:
*&quot;magnus omnium incessit timor animis&quot; (Caesar &quot;Bellum Civile&quot; 2.29)
:&quot;Great fear (&quot;magnus timor&quot;) overcame the minds of all of them (&quot;omnium animis&quot;).&quot;

Another kind of hyperbaton (called &quot;conjunct hyperbaton&quot; by Devine and Stephens) is found when a phrase consisting of two words joined by &quot;et&quot; (&quot;and&quot;) is separated by another word:
*&quot;Aspendus, vetus oppidum et nobile&quot; (Cicero, &quot;Verr.&quot; 2.1.53) 
:&quot;Aspendus, an old town, and a noble one&quot;.

*&quot;Faesulas inter Arretiumque&quot; (Livy, 22.3.3)
:&quot;Between Faesulae and Arretium&quot;.

====Poetry====
In poetry, especially poetry from the 1st century BC onwards, hyperbaton is very common; some 40% of Horace&#x27;s adjectives are separated from their nouns.

Frequently two hyperbata are used in the same sentence, as in the following example:
*&quot;quam Catullus unam/ plus quam se atque suos amavit omnes&quot; (Catullus 58a) 
:&quot;whom alone (&quot;quam unam&quot;) Catullus loved (&quot;amavit&quot;) more than himself and all his own (&quot;suos omnes&quot;).&quot;

Often two noun phrases are interleaved in a double hyperbaton:
*&quot;saevae memorem Iunonis ob iram&quot; (Virgil, &quot;Aeneid&quot;, 1.5)
:&quot;on account of the mindful anger (&quot;memorem iram&quot;) of cruel Juno (&quot;saevae Iunonis&quot;)&quot;.
*&quot;lurida terribiles miscent aconita novercae&quot; (Ovid, &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, 1.147)
:&quot;Fearsome stepmothers (&quot;terribiles novercae&quot;) mix lurid aconites (&quot;lurida aconita&quot;).&quot;

The above type, where two adjectives are followed by a verb and then two nouns in the same order as the adjectives, is often referred to as a &quot;golden line&quot;.

Occasionally (but rarely) three separate noun phrases can be interleaved, for example:

: (Ovid, &quot;Ex Ponto&quot; 4.9.65–6.)
:&quot;Martial Rome () sees no higher command () than supreme Consul ()&quot;

In the following line, a conjunct hyperbaton is interleaved with another noun phrase:
:&quot;venator cursu canis et latratibus instat&quot; (Virgil, &quot;Aeneid&quot; 12.751)
:&quot;the hunting dog (&quot;venator canis&quot;) threatens him with running and barking (&quot;cursu et latratibus&quot;).&quot;

In other cases one hyperbaton is inserted inside another:
*&quot;in nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas / corpora&quot; (Ovid, &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; 1.1)
:&quot;My spirit leads me to tell of forms transformed (&quot;mutatas formas&quot;) into new bodies (&quot;nova corpora&quot;).&quot;
*&quot;ab Hyrcanis Indoque a litore silvis&quot; (Lucan 8.343)
:&quot;from the Hyrcanian forests (&quot;Hyrcanis silvis&quot;) and from the Indian shore (&quot;Indo litore&quot;).&quot;

The following example is from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. Here the clause &quot;which patient bullocks might cultivate&quot;, which already contains a hyperbaton of the phrase &quot;patient bullocks&quot;, is in turn is split up by the words :

: (Ovid, &quot;Met.&quot; 3.584)
:&quot;My father did not leave me any fields () which patient bullocks () might cultivate&quot;

In some cases, the placing of two adjectives together may highlight a contrast between them, for example, in the following sentence from Horace, where the fragility of the boat is contrasted with the roughness of the sea:
*&quot;qui fragilem truci commisit pelago ratem&quot; (Horace, &quot;Odes&quot;, 1.3.10f) 
:&quot;who committed a fragile boat (&quot;fragilem ratem&quot;) to the rough sea (&quot;truci pelago&quot;)&quot;

Similarly in the example from Ovid below &quot;transparent&quot; is contrasted with &quot;dense&quot;:
*&quot;et liquidum spisso secrevit ab aere caelum&quot; (Ovid, &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; 1.23)
:&quot;and He separated the transparent heaven (&quot;liquidum caelum&quot;) from the dense atmosphere (&quot;spisso aere&quot;).&quot;

Sometimes pretty effects are obtained by apparently switching the order of the adjectives:
: (Ovid, &quot;Amores&quot;, 3.4.46)
:&quot;thus great influence () comes with very little labour ()&quot;

Usually the adjective in a discontinuous noun phrase comes first, as in the above examples, but the opposite is also possible: 
*&quot;cristāque tegit galea aurea rubrā&quot; (Virgil, &quot;Aeneid&quot; 9.50)
:&quot;And a golden helmet with a red crest (&quot;crista rubra&quot;) covers him.&quot;
*&quot;silva lupus in Sabina&quot; (Horace, &quot;Odes&quot;, 1.22) 
:&quot;a wolf (&quot;lupus&quot;) (lurking) in the Sabine forest (&quot;silva Sabina&quot;).&quot;

The above example illustrates another occasional feature of hyperbaton, since the word &quot;wolf&quot; (&quot;lupus&quot;) is actually inside the phrase &quot;Sabine forest&quot; (&quot;silva Sabina&quot;). This kind of word-play is found elsewhere in Horace also, e.g. &quot;grato, Pyrrha, sub antro&quot; &quot;Pyrrha, beneath a pleasant grotto&quot;, where Pyrrha is indeed in a grotto; and in the quotation from Horace &quot;Odes&quot; 1.5 below, the girl is surrounded by the graceful boy, who in turn is surrounded by a profusion of roses:
*&quot;quis multa gracilis te puer in rosa&quot; (Horace, &quot;Odes&quot;, 1.5)
:&quot;what graceful boy (&quot;gracilis puer&quot;) (is embracing) you (&quot;te&quot;) amidst many a rose (&quot;multa rosa&quot;)?&quot;

In Ovid, hyperbaton or dislocated word order is particularly common in his elegiac poetry. Kenney quotes the following. Here the words &quot;I was afraid lest I might be captured&quot;, which are already dislocated into , are interleaved with the phrase &quot;if I had gone out in the night&quot;:
* (Ovid, &quot;Her.&quot; 3.19)
:&quot;If I had gone out () at night (), I was afraid I might be captured&quot;

Housman comments: &quot;the dislocation of together with its juxtaposition with lends emphasis to [Briseis&#x27;s] fears of getting lost in the dark.&quot;

===Other languages===
The classical type of hyperbaton is also found in Slavic languages like Polish:

Certain conditions are necessary for hyperbaton to be possible in Polish: discontinuous noun phrases typically contain just one modifier, and the noun and modifier must be separated by a verb (and not, for example, by the indirect object &quot;Markowi&quot; alone).

Similar constructions are found in other languages, such as Russian, Latvian, and Modern Greek from which the following example comes:

Ntelitheos (2004) points out that one condition enabling such constructions is that the adjective is in contrastive focus (&quot;the red dress, not the blue one&quot;).

==English usage==

In English studies, the term &quot;hyperbaton&quot; is defined differently, as &quot;a figure of speech in which the normal order of words is reversed, as in &quot;cheese I love&quot;&quot; (Collins English Dictionary) or &quot;a transposition or inversion of idiomatic word order (as &quot;echoed the hills&quot; for &quot;the hills echoed&quot;)&quot; (Merriam-Webster online dictionary). Some examples are given below:
* &quot;Bloody thou art; bloody will be thy end&quot; — William Shakespeare in &quot;Richard III&quot;, 4.4, 198.
* &quot;Object there was none. Passion there was none.&quot; — Edgar Allan Poe, &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;.
* &quot;The helmsman steered, the ship moved on; / Yet never a breeze up blew&quot; — Samuel Taylor Coleridge, &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;
* &quot;For while the tired waves, vainly breaking, / Seem here no painful inch to gain&quot; — Arthur Hugh Clough, &quot;Say Not the Struggle Naught Availeth&quot;.
* &quot;Arms and the man I sing&quot; — Opening words of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, translated by E. F. Taylor (1907).
* &quot;Backward ran sentences until reeled the mind.&quot; — Wolcott Gibbs&#x27;s 1936 parody of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.
* &quot;Alone with Christ, desolate else, left by mankind.&quot; — Lionel Johnson, The Church of a Dream (1890)

<doc id="92379" wikidata="Q582726" url="?curid=92379" title="Catachresis">
<text>Catachresis (from Greek , &quot;misuse&quot;), originally meaning a semantic misuse or error—e.g., using &quot;militate&quot; for &quot;mitigate&quot;, &quot;chronic&quot; for &quot;severe&quot;, &quot;travesty&quot; for &quot;tragedy&quot;, &quot;anachronism&quot; for &quot;anomaly&quot;, &quot;alibi&quot; for &quot;excuse&quot;, etc.—is also the name given to many different types of figures of speech in which a word or phrase is being applied in a way that significantly departs from conventional (or traditional) usage. As a rhetorical figure, catachresis may signify an unexpected or implausible metaphor.

==Variant definitions==

There are various characterizations of catachresis found in the literature.

==Examples==
Dead people in a graveyard being referred to as inhabitants is an example of catachresis.

Example from Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry&quot;:
Masters of this [catachresis] will say,
:Mow the beard,
:Shave the grass,
:Pin the plank,
:Nail my sleeve.

==Use in literature==
Catachresis is often used to convey extreme emotion or alienation. It is prominent in baroque literature and, more recently, in dadaist and surrealist literature.

==Use in philosophy and criticism==
In Jacques Derrida&#x27;s ideas of deconstruction, catachresis refers to the original incompleteness that is a part of all systems of meaning. He proposes that metaphor and catachresis are tropes that ground philosophical discourse.

Postcolonial theorist Gayatri Spivak applies this word to &quot;master words&quot; that claim to represent a group, &quot;e.g.&quot;, women or the proletariat, when there are no &quot;true&quot; examples of &quot;woman&quot; or &quot;proletarian&quot;. In a similar way, words that are imposed upon people and are deemed improper thus denote a catachresis, a word with an arbitrary connection to its meaning.

<doc id="92382" wikidata="Q528728" url="?curid=92382" title="Chiasmus">
<text>In rhetoric, chiasmus ( ) or, less commonly, chiasm (Latin term from Greek , &quot;crossing&quot;, from the Greek , , &quot;to shape like the letter Χ&quot;), is a &quot;reversal of grammatical structures in successive phrases or clauses – but no repetition of words&quot;.

A similar device, antimetabole, also involves a reversal of grammatical structures in successive phrases or clauses in an A-B-B-A configuration, but unlike chiasmus, presents a repetition of words.

==Examples==
Chiasmus balances words or phrases with similar, though not identical, meanings:

&quot;Dotes&quot; and &quot;strongly loves&quot; share the same meaning and bracket, as do &quot;doubts&quot; and &quot;suspects&quot;.

Additional examples of chiasmus:

For comparison, the following is considered antimetabole, in which the reversal in structure involves the same words:

Both chiasmus and antimetabole can be used to reinforce antithesis. In chiasmus, the clauses display inverted parallelism. Chiasmus was particularly popular in the literature of the ancient world, including Hebrew, Greek, Latin and K&#x27;iche&#x27; Maya, where it was used to articulate the balance of order within the text. Many long and complex chiasmi have been found in Shakespeare and the Greek and Hebrew texts of the Bible. Chiasmus is also found throughout the Quran and the Book of Mormon.

== Conceptual chiasmus ==
Chiasmus can be used in the structure of entire passages to parallel concepts or ideas. This process, termed &quot;conceptual chiasmus&quot;, uses a criss-crossing rhetorical structure to cause an overlapping of &quot;intellectual space&quot;. Conceptual chiasmus utilizes specific linguistic choices, often metaphors, to create a connection between two differing disciplines. By employing a chiastic structure to a single presented concept, rhetors encourage one area of thought to consider an opposing area&#x27;s perspective.

== Effectiveness==

Chiasmus derives its effectiveness from its symmetrical structure. The structural symmetry of the chiasmus imposes the impression upon the reader or listener that the entire argument has been accounted for. In other words, chiasmus creates only two sides of an argument or idea for the listener to consider, and then leads the listener to favor one side of the argument.

==Thematic chiasmus==
The &quot;Wilhelmus&quot;, the national anthem of the Netherlands, has a structure composed around a thematic chiasmus: the 15 stanzas of the text are symmetrical, in that verses one and 15 resemble one another in meaning, as do verses two and 14, three and 13, etc., until they converge in the eighth verse, the heart of the song. Written in the 16th century, the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; originated in the nation&#x27;s struggle to achieve independence. It tells of the Father of the Nation William of Orange who was stadholder in the Netherlands under the king of Spain. In the first person, as if quoting himself, William speaks to the Dutch people and talks about both the outer conflict – the Dutch Revolt – as well as his own, inner struggle: on one hand, he tries to be faithful to the king of Spain, on the other hand, he is above all faithful to his conscience: to serve God and the Dutch people. This is made apparent in the central 8th stanza: &quot;Oh David, thou soughtest shelter from King Saul&#x27;s tyranny. Even so I fled this welter&quot;. Here the comparison is made between the biblical David and William of Orange as merciful and just leaders who both serve under tyrannic kings. As the merciful David succeeds the unjust Saul and is rewarded by God with the kingdom of Israel, so too, with the help of God, will William be rewarded a kingdom; being either or both the Netherlands, and the kingdom of God.

<text>Algolagnia (; from , &quot;álgos&quot;, &quot;pain&quot;, and , &quot;lagneía&quot;, &quot;lust&quot;) is a sexual tendency which is defined by deriving sexual pleasure and stimulation from physical pain, often involving an erogenous zone. Studies conducted indicate differences in how the brains of those with algolagnia interpret nerve input.

==History of research==
In 1892, Albert von Schrenck-Notzing introduced the term algolagnia to describe &quot;sexual&quot; masochism, to differentiate it from Charles Féré&#x27;s earlier term called &quot;algophilia&quot;; Schrenck-Notzing&#x27;s interpretation was that algolagnia involved &quot;lust&quot;, not &quot;love&quot; as Fere interpreted the phenomenon. (It should be cautioned, though, that the definitions regarding sadism and masochism as medical terms have changed over the years (as also noted in the main article for that topic) and are still evolving, and there are also non-medical definitions of sadomasochism.) However, Krafft-Ebing&#x27;s theories in &quot;Psychopathia Sexualis&quot; – where the terms sadism and masochism were used – were adopted by Sigmund Freud and became an integral part of psychoanalysis, thereby ensuring their predominance over the concept of &quot;algolagnia&quot;.

The neurologist Albert Eulenberg was another one of the first researchers to look into algolagnia, in the 1902 &quot;Sadismus und Masochismus&quot; (Sadism and Masochism). Soon thereafter, Havelock Ellis also looked into algolagnia, in the early 1900s, and stated &quot;Sadism and Masochism – Algolagnia Includes Both Groups of Manifestations&quot; but maintained that enjoyment of pain was restricted to an erotic context, in contrast to Krafft-Ebing&#x27;s interpretations. With such titles as &quot;Analysis of the Sexual Impulse, Love and Pain, The Sexual Impulse in Women&quot; and &quot;The Evolution of Modesty, The Phenomena of Sexual Periodicity, Auto-Erotism&quot;, Ellis described the basics of the condition. Eugen Kahn, Smith Ely Jelliffe, William Alanson White, and Hugh Northcote were other early psychological researchers into algolagnia.

==Research==
In 1992, algolagnia was described as a physical phenomenon in which the brain interprets pain signals as pleasurable leading to psychological effects. Dolf Zillmann wrote that:

...most algolagniacs see their actions as an active lust, not a motivational one. Patients with algolagnia could lead normal lives, enjoy normal arousal sequences, and indulge in fairly normal sexual intercourse, but when exposed to sexual pain, were unable to control their reaction. One woman described it as being unable to prevent her arousal or subsequent orgasm due to pain, even if she was not aroused when it began.

This and other research have linked algolagnia to aggression, hypersexuality, or other control psychoses.

Research using MRI and computer models of neuron firing patterns has shown that most algolagniacs experience pain differently from others. Algolagniacs may have DNA errors such as SCN9A, causing inaccurate nociception to occur.

At least one researcher in the 1900s, Albert Freiherr von Schrenck-Notzing, who was a self-professed sadist, thought that algolagnia was a psychological disorder. This view began to change once the Kinsey Reports noted that many seemingly normal people often enjoy pain in a sexual context, and later Norman Breslow found that, before 1977, only four previous studies in all the scientific literature were empirical in nature. One of the researchers whom Breslow cited as having empirically-valid work, Andres Spengler, concluded that earlier research was &quot;heavily burdened with prejudice and ignorance&quot; against those whose sexual practices were in the minority, falsely assuming behaviors to be pathological when in fact they were statistically abnormal, but harmless. In 1993 Thomas Wetzstein published a large-scale study of his local subculture from a sociological viewpoint, confirming Spengler&#x27;s results and expanding on them.

No empirical study has found a connection to violent crimes or evidence for an increased tendency towards any sociopathological behavior in algolagnia or the related features of sexual sadomasochism, as had been generally assumed since Krafft-Ebing&#x27;s era.

The term algolagnia has fallen into rare usage, and there is no entry for it in the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s DSM IV-TR. Inflicting pain on others has been termed &quot;active algolagnia&quot; and equated to the pathological form of sadism in Mosby&#x27;s Medical Dictionary, which also equates the pathological form of masochism to &quot;passive algolagnia&quot;, but it cannot be a pathological (dangerous) paraphilia form of sadism or masochism unless it involves pain inflicted on &quot;non-consenting&quot; persons, or &quot;cause[s] marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.&quot; And using algolagnia as both a pathological and non-pathological term, some in the modern research community still link it to some but not all BDSM activities.

There is little ongoing research, with most neurophysiologists concentrating on neuropathological reasons for such reactions.

<text>η Carinae ([[Eta]] Carinae, abbreviated to η Car), formerly known as η Argus, is a stellar system containing at least two stars with a combined luminosity greater than five million times that of the Sun, located around distant in the constellation Carina. Previously a 4th-magnitude star, it brightened in 1837 to become brighter than Rigel, marking the start of its so-called &quot;Great Eruption&quot;. It became the second-brightest star in the sky between 11–14 March 1843 before fading well below naked-eye visibility after 1856. In a smaller eruption, it reached 6th magnitude in 1892 before fading again. It has brightened consistently since about 1940, becoming brighter than magnitude 4.5 by 2014.

At declination −59° 41′ 04.26″, η Carinae is circumpolar from locations on Earth south of latitude 30°S (for reference, the latitude of Johannesburg is 26°12′S), and is not visible north of about latitude 30°N, just south of Cairo (which is at a latitude of 30°02′N).

The two main stars of the η Carinae system have an eccentric orbit with a period of 5.54 years. The primary is an extremely unusual star, similar to a luminous blue variable (LBV). It was initially , of which it has already lost at least , and it is expected to explode as a supernova in the astronomically near future. This is the only star known to produce ultraviolet laser emission. The secondary star is hot and also highly luminous, probably of spectral class O, around 30–80 times as massive as the Sun. The system is heavily obscured by the Homunculus Nebula, which consists of material ejected from the primary during the Great Eruption. It is a member of the open cluster, itself embedded in the much larger Carina Nebula.

Although unrelated to the star and nebula, the weak Eta Carinids meteor shower has a radiant very close to η Carinae.

==Observational history==
η Carinae was first recorded as a fourth-magnitude star in the 16th or 17th century. It became the second-brightest star in the sky in the mid-19th century, before fading below naked-eye visibility. During the second half of the 20th century, it slowly brightened to again become visible to the naked eye, and by 2014 was again a fourth-magnitude star.

===Discovery and naming===
There is no reliable evidence of η Carinae being observed or recorded before the 17th century, although Dutch navigator Pieter Keyser described a fourth-magnitude star at approximately the correct position around 1595–1596, which was copied onto the celestial globes of Petrus Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and the 1603 &quot;Uranometria&quot; of Johann Bayer. Frederick de Houtman&#x27;s independent star catalogue from 1603 does not include η Carinae among the other 4th magnitude stars in the region. The earliest firm record was made by Edmond Halley in 1677 when he recorded the star simply as &quot;Sequens&quot; (i.e. &quot;following&quot; relative to another star) within a new constellation Robur Carolinum. His &quot;Catalogus Stellarum Australium&quot; was published in 1679. The star was also known by the Bayer designations η Roboris Caroli, η Argus, or η Navis. In 1751 Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille gave the stars of Argo Navis and Robur Carolinum a single set of Greek letter Bayer designations within his constellation Argo, and designated three areas within Argo for the purposes of using Latin letter designations three times over. The letter η fell within the keel portion of the ship which was later to become the constellation Carina. It was not generally known as η Carinae until 1879, when the stars of Argo Navis were finally given the epithets of the daughter constellations in the &quot;Uranometria Argentina&quot; of Gould.

η Carinae is too far south to be part of the mansion-based traditional Chinese astronomy, but it was mapped when the Southern Asterisms were created at the start of the 17th century. Together with s Carinae, λ Centauri and λ Muscae, η Carinae forms the asterism (Sea and Mountain). η Carinae has the names Tseen She (from the Chinese 天社 [Mandarin: &quot;tiānshè&quot;] &quot;Heaven&#x27;s altar&quot;) and Foramen. It is also known as (, ).

Halley gave an approximate apparent magnitude 4 at the time of discovery, which has been calculated as magnitude 3.3 on the modern scale. The handful of possible earlier sightings suggest that η Carinae was not significantly brighter than this for much of the 17th century. Further sporadic observations over the next 70 years show that η Carinae was probably around 3rd magnitude or fainter, until Lacaille reliably recorded it at 2nd magnitude in 1751. It is unclear whether η Carinae varied significantly in brightness over the next 50 years; there are occasional observations such as William Burchell&#x27;s at 4th magnitude in 1815, but it is uncertain whether these are just re-recordings of earlier observations.

===Great Eruption===

In 1827, Burchell specifically noted η Carinae&#x27;s unusual brightness at 1st magnitude, and was the first to suspect that it varied in brightness. John Herschel, who was in South Africa at the time, made a detailed series of accurate measurements in the 1830s showing that η Carinae consistently shone around magnitude 1.4 until November 1837. On the evening of 16 December 1837, Herschel was astonished to see that it had brightened to slightly outshine Rigel. This event marked the beginning of a roughly 18-year period known as the Great Eruption.

η Carinae was brighter still on 27 January 1838, equivalent to Alpha Centauri, before fading slightly over the following three months. Herschel did not observe the star after this, but received correspondence from the Reverend W.S. Mackay in Calcutta, who wrote in 1843, &quot;To my great surprise I observed this March last (1843), that the star η Argus had become a star of the first magnitude fully as bright as Canopus, and in colour and size very like Arcturus.&quot; Observations at the Cape of Good Hope indicated it peaked in brightness, surpassing Canopus, from 11 to 14 March 1843, then began to fade, then brightened to between the brightness of Alpha Centauri and Canopus between 24 and 28 March before fading once again. For much of 1844 the brightness was midway between Alpha Centauri and Beta Centauri, around magnitude +0.2, before brightening again at the end of the year. At its brightest in 1843 it likely reached an apparent magnitude of −0.8, then −1.0 in 1845. The peaks in 1827, 1838 and 1843 are likely to have occurred at the periastron passage—the point the two stars are closest together—of the binary orbit. From 1845 to 1856, the brightness decreased by around 0.1 magnitudes per year, but with possible rapid and large fluctuations.

In their oral traditions, the Boorong clan of the Wergaia people of Lake Tyrrell, north-western Victoria, Australia, told of a reddish star they knew as &quot;Collowgullouric War&quot; &quot;Old Woman Crow&quot;, the wife of &quot;War&quot; &quot;Crow&quot; (Canopus). In 2010, astronomers Duane Hamacher and David Frew from Macquarie University in Sydney showed that this was η Carinae during its Great Eruption in the 1840s. From 1857, the brightness decreased rapidly until it faded below naked-eye visibility by 1886. This has been calculated to be due to the condensation of dust in the ejected material surrounding the star, rather than to an intrinsic change in luminosity.

===Lesser Eruption===
A new brightening started in 1887, peaked at about magnitude 6.2 in 1892, then at the end of March 1895 faded rapidly to about magnitude 7.5. Although there are only visual records of the 1890 eruption, it has been calculated that η Carinae was suffering 4.3 magnitudes of visual extinction due to the gas and dust ejected in the Great Eruption. An unobscured brightness would have been magnitude 1.5–1.9, significantly brighter than the historical magnitude. Despite this, it was similar to the first one, even almost matching its brightness, but not the amount of material expelled.

===Twentieth century===
Between 1900 and at least 1940, η Carinae appeared to have settled at a constant brightness of around magnitude 7.6, but in 1953 it was noted to have brightened again to magnitude 6.5. The brightening continued steadily, but with fairly regular variations of a few tenths of a magnitude.
In 1996, the variations were first identified as having a 5.52 year period, later measured more accurately at 5.54 years, leading to the idea of a binary system. The binary theory was confirmed by observations of radio, optical and near-infrared radial velocity and line profile changes, referred to collectively as a &quot;spectroscopic event&quot;, at the predicted time of periastron passage in late 1997 and early 1998. At the same time there was a complete collapse of the X-ray emission presumed to originate in a colliding wind zone. The confirmation of a luminous binary companion greatly modified the understanding of the physical properties of the η Carinae system and its variability.

A sudden doubling of brightness was observed in 1998–99 bringing it back to naked-eye visibility. During the 2014 spectroscopic event, the apparent visual magnitude became brighter than magnitude 4.5. The brightness does not always vary consistently at different wavelengths, and does not always exactly follow the 5.5 year cycle. Radio, infrared and space-based observations have expanded coverage of η Carinae across all wavelengths and revealed ongoing changes in the spectral energy distribution.

In July 2018, η Carinae was reported to have the strongest colliding wind shock in the solar neighbourhood. Observations with the NuSTAR satellite gave much higher resolution data than the earlier Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Using direct focussing observations of the non-thermal source in the extremely hard X-ray band that is spatially coincident with the star, they showed that the source of non-thermal X-rays varies with the orbital phase of the binary star system and that the photon index of the emission is similar to that derived through analysis of the γ-ray (gamma) spectrum.

==Visibility==

As a fourth-magnitude star, η Carinae is comfortably visible to the naked eye in all but the most light-polluted skies in inner-city areas according to the Bortle scale. Its brightness has varied over a wide range, from the second-brightest star in the sky for a few days in the 19th century, to well below naked-eye visibility. Its location at around 60°S in the far southern celestial hemisphere means it cannot be seen by observers in Europe and much of North America.

Located between Canopus and the Southern Cross, η Carinae is easily pinpointed as the brightest star within the large naked-eye Carina Nebula. In a telescope the &quot;star&quot; is framed within the dark &quot;V&quot; dust lane of the nebula and appears distinctly orange and clearly non-stellar. High magnification will show the two orange lobes of a surrounding reflection nebula known as the Homunculus Nebula on either side of a bright central core. Variable star observers can compare its brightness with several 4th- and 5th-magnitude stars closely surrounding the nebula.

Discovered in 1961, the weak Eta Carinids meteor shower has a radiant very close to η Carinae. Occurring from 14 to 28 January, the shower peaks around 21 January. Meteor showers are not associated with bodies outside the Solar System, making the proximity to η Carinae merely a coincidence.

===Visual spectrum===

The strength and profile of the lines in the η Carinae spectrum are highly variable, but there are a number of consistent distinctive features. The spectrum is dominated by emission lines, usually broad although the higher excitation lines are overlaid by a narrow central component from dense ionised nebulosity, especially the Weigelt Blobs. Most lines show a P Cygni profile but with the absorption wing much weaker than the emission. The broad P Cygni lines are typical of strong stellar winds, with very weak absorption in this case because the central star is so heavily obscured. Electron scattering wings are present but relatively weak, indicating a clumpy wind. Hydrogen lines are present and strong, showing that η Carinae still retains much of its hydrogen envelope.

HeI lines are much weaker than the hydrogen lines, and the absence of HeII lines provides an upper limit to the possible temperature of the primary star. NII lines can be identified but are not strong, while carbon lines cannot be detected and oxygen lines are at best very weak, indicating core hydrogen burning via the CNO cycle with some mixing to the surface. Perhaps the most striking feature is the rich FeII emission in both permitted and forbidden lines, with the forbidden lines arising from excitation of low density nebulosity around the star.

The earliest analyses of the star&#x27;s spectrum are descriptions of visual observations from 1869, of prominent emission lines &quot;C, D, b, F and the principal green nitrogen line&quot;. Absorption lines are explicitly described as not being visible. The letters refer to Fraunhofer&#x27;s spectral notation and correspond to Hα, HeI, FeII, and Hβ.

It is assumed that the final line is from FeII very close to the green nebulium line now known to be from OIII.

Photographic spectra from 1893 were described as similar to an F5 star, but with a few weak emission lines. Analysis to modern spectral standards suggests an early F spectral type. By 1895 the spectrum again consisted mostly of strong emission lines, with the absorption lines present but largely obscured by emission. This spectral transition from F supergiant to strong emission is characteristic of novae, where ejected material initially radiates like a pseudo-photosphere and then the emission spectrum develops as it expands and thins.

The emission line spectrum associated with dense stellar winds has persisted ever since the late 19th century. Individual lines show widely varying widths, profiles and Doppler shifts, often multiple velocity components within the same line. The spectral lines also show variation over time, most strongly with a 5.5-year period but also less dramatic changes over shorter and longer periods, as well as ongoing secular development of the entire spectrum. The spectrum of light reflected from the Weigelt Blobs, and assumed to originate mainly with the primary, is similar to the extreme P Cygni-type star which has a spectral type of B0Ieq.
Direct spectral observations did not begin until after the Great Eruption, but light echoes from the eruption reflected from other parts of the Carina Nebula were detected using the U.S. National Optical Astronomy Observatory&#x27;s Blanco 4-meter telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. Analysis of the reflected spectra indicated the light was emitted when η Carinae had the appearance of a G2-to-G5 supergiant, some 2,000 K cooler than expected from other supernova impostor events. Further light echo observations show that following the peak brightness of the Great Eruption the spectrum developed prominent P Cygni profiles and CN molecular bands, although this is likely from the material being ejected which may have been colliding with circumstellar material in a similar way to a type IIn supernova.

In the second half of the 20th century, much higher-resolution visual spectra became available. The spectrum continued to show complex and baffling features, with much of the energy from the central star being recycled into the infrared by surrounding dust, some reflection of light from the star from dense localised objects in the circumstellar material, but with obvious high-ionisation features indicative of very high temperatures. The line profiles are complex and variable, indicating a number of absorption and emission features at various velocities relative to the central star.

The 5.5-year orbital cycle produces strong spectral changes at periastron that are known as spectroscopic events. Certain wavelengths of radiation suffer eclipses, either due to actual occultation by one of the stars or due to passage within opaque portions of the complex stellar winds. Despite being ascribed to orbital rotation, these events vary significantly from cycle to cycle. These changes have become stronger since 2003 and it is generally believed that long-term secular changes in the stellar winds or previously ejected material may be the culmination of a return to the state of the star before its Great Eruption.

===Ultraviolet===

The ultraviolet spectrum of the η Carinae system shows many emission lines of ionised metals such as FeII and CrII, as well as Lymanα (Lyα) and a continuum from a hot central source. The ionisation levels and continuum require the existence of a source with a temperature at least 37,000 K.

Certain FeII UV lines are unusually strong. These originate in the Weigelt Blobs and are caused by a low-gain lasing effect. Ionised hydrogen between a blob and the central star generates intense Lyα emission which penetrates the blob. The blob contains atomic hydrogen with a small admixture of other elements, including iron photo-ionised by radiation from the central stars. An accidental resonance (where emission coincidentally has a suitable energy to pump the excited state) allows the Lyα emission to pump the Fe+ ions to certain pseudo-metastable states, creating a population inversion that allows the stimulated emission to take place. This effect is similar to the maser emission from dense pockets surrounding many cool supergiant stars, but the latter effect is much weaker at optical and UV wavelengths and η Carinae is the only clear instance detected of an ultraviolet astrophysical laser. A similar effect from pumping of metastable OI states by Lyβ emission has also been confirmed as an astrophysical UV laser.

===Infrared===

Infrared observations of η Carinae have become increasingly important. The vast majority of the electromagnetic radiation from the central stars is absorbed by surrounding dust, then emitted as mid- and far infrared appropriate to the temperature of the dust. This allows almost the entire energy output of the system to be observed at wavelengths that are not strongly affected by interstellar extinction, leading to estimates of the luminosity that are more accurate than for other extremely luminous stars. η Carinae is the brightest source in the night sky at mid-infrared wavelengths.

Far infrared observations show a large mass of dust at 100–150 K, suggesting a total mass for the Homunculus of 20 solar masses () or more. This is much larger than previous estimates, and is all thought to have been ejected in a few years during the Great Eruption.

Near-infrared observations can penetrate the dust at high resolution to observe features that are completely obscured at visual wavelengths, although not the central stars themselves. The central region of the Homunculus contains a smaller &quot;Little Homunculus&quot; from the 1890 eruption, a &quot;butterfly&quot; of separate clumps and filaments from the two eruptions, and an elongated stellar wind region.

===High energy radiation===

Several X-ray and gamma ray sources have been detected around η Carinae, for example 4U 1037–60 in the 4th Uhuru catalogue and 1044–59 in the HEAO-2 catalog. The earliest detection of X-rays in the η Carinae region was from the Terrier-Sandhawk rocket, followed by Ariel 5, OSO 8, and Uhuru sightings.

More detailed observations were made with the Einstein Observatory, ROSAT X-ray telescope, Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA), and Chandra X-ray Observatory. There are multiple sources at various wavelengths right across the high energy electromagnetic spectrum: hard X-rays and gamma rays within 1 light-month of the η Carinae; hard X-rays from a central region about 3 light-months wide; a distinct partial ring &quot;horse-shoe&quot; structure in low-energy X-rays 0.67 parsec (2.2 light-years) across corresponding to the main shockfront from the Great Eruption; diffuse X-ray emission across the whole area of the Homunculus; and numerous condensations and arcs outside the main ring.

All the high-energy emission associated with η Carinae varies during the orbital cycle. A spectroscopic minimum, or X-ray eclipse, occurred in July and August 2003, and similar events in 2009 and 2014 have been intensively observed. The highest-energy gamma rays above 100 MeV detected by AGILE show strong variability, while lower-energy gamma rays observed by Fermi show little variability.

===Radio emission===
Radio emissions have been observed from η Carinae across the microwave band. It has been detected in the 21 cm HI line, but has been particularly closely studied in the millimetre and centimetre bands. Masing hydrogen recombination lines (from the combining of an electron and proton to form a hydrogen atom) have been detected in this range. The emission is concentrated in a small non-point source less than 4 arcseconds across and appears to be mainly free-free emission (thermal bremsstrahlung) from ionised gas, consistent with a compact HII region at around 10,000 K. High resolution imaging shows the radio frequencies originating from a disk a few arcseconds in diameter, 10,000 astronomical units () wide at the distance of η Carinae.

The radio emission from η Carinae shows continuous variation in strength and distribution over a 5.5 year cycle. The HII and recombination lines vary very strongly, with continuum emission (electromagnetic radiation across a broad band of wavelengths) less affected. This shows a dramatic reduction in the ionisation level of the hydrogen for a short period in each cycle, coinciding with the spectroscopic events at other wavelengths.

==Surroundings==
η Carinae is found within the Carina Nebula, a giant star-forming region in the Carina–Sagittarius Arm of the Milky Way. The nebula is a prominent naked-eye object in the southern skies showing a complex mix of emission, reflection and dark nebulosity. η Carinae is known to be at the same distance as the Carina Nebula and its spectrum can be seen reflected off various star clouds in the nebula. The appearance of the Carina Nebula, and particularly of the Keyhole region, has changed significantly since it was described by John Herschel over years ago. This is thought to be due to the reduction in ionising radiation from Eta Carinae since the Great Eruption. Prior to the Great Eruption the η Carinae system contributed up to 20% of the total ionising flux for the whole Carina Nebula, but that is now mostly blocked by the surrounding gas and dust.

===Trumpler 16===

η Carinae lies within the scattered stars of the Trumpler 16 open cluster. All the other members are well below naked eye visibility, although WR 25 is another extremely massive luminous star. Trumpler 16 and its neighbour Trumpler 14 are the two dominant star clusters of the Carina OB1 association, an extended grouping of young luminous stars with a common motion through space.

===Homunculus===
η Carinae is enclosed by, and lights up, the Homunculus Nebula, a small emission and reflection nebula composed mainly of gas ejected during the Great Eruption event in the mid-19th century, as well as dust that condensed from the debris. The nebula consists of two polar lobes aligned with the rotation axis of the star, plus an equatorial &quot;skirt&quot;, the whole being around long. Closer studies show many fine details: a &quot;Little Homunculus&quot; within the main nebula, probably formed by the 1890 eruption; a jet; fine streams and knots of material, especially noticeable in the skirt region; and three Weigelt Blobs—dense gas condensations very close to the star itself.

The lobes of the Homunculus are considered to be formed almost entirely due to the initial eruption, rather than shaped by or including previously ejected or interstellar material, although the scarcity of material near the equatorial plane allows some later stellar wind and ejected material to mix. Therefore, the mass of the lobes gives an accurate measure of the scale of the Great Eruption, with estimates ranging from up to as high as . The results show that the material from the Great Eruption is strongly concentrated towards the poles; 75% of the mass and 90% of the kinetic energy were released above latitude 45°.

A unique feature of the Homunculus is the ability to measure the spectrum of the central object at different latitudes by the reflected spectrum from different portions of the lobes. These clearly show a &quot;polar wind&quot; where the stellar wind is faster and stronger at high latitudes thought to be due to rapid rotation causing gravity brightening towards the poles. In contrast the spectrum shows a higher excitation temperature closer to the equatorial plane. By implication the outer envelope of η Carinae A is not strongly convective as that would prevent the gravity darkening. The current axis of rotation of the star does not appear to exactly match the alignment of the Homunculus. This may be due to interaction with η Carinae B which also modifies the observed stellar winds.

==Distance==
The distance to η Carinae has been determined by several different methods, resulting in a widely accepted value of , with a margin of error around . The distance to η Carinae itself cannot be measured using parallax due to its surrounding nebulosity, but other stars in the Trumpler 16 cluster are expected to be at a similar distance and are accessible to parallax. Gaia Data Release 2 has provided the parallax for many stars considered to be members of Trumpler 16, finding that the four hottest O-class stars in the region have very similar parallaxes with a mean value of (mas), which translates to a distance of . This implies that η Carinae may be more distant than previously thought, and also more luminous, although it is still possible that it is not at the same distance as the cluster or that the parallax measurements have large systematic errors.

The distances to star clusters can be estimated by using a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram or colour–colour diagram to calibrate the absolute magnitudes of the stars, for example fitting the main sequence or identifying features such as a horizontal branch, and hence their distance from Earth. It is also necessary to know the amount of interstellar extinction to the cluster and this can be difficult in regions such as the Carina Nebula. A distance of has been determined from the calibration of O-type star luminosities in Trumpler 16. After determining an abnormal reddening correction to the extinction, the distance to both Trumpler 14 and Trumpler 16 has been measured at ().

The known expansion rate of the Homunculus Nebula provides an unusual geometric method for measuring its distance. Assuming that the two lobes of the nebula are symmetrical, the projection of the nebula onto the sky depends on its distance. Values of 2,300, 2,250, and have been derived for the Homunculus, and η Carinae is clearly at the same distance.

==Properties==

The η Carinae star system is currently one of the most massive stars that can be studied in great detail. Until recently η Carinae was thought to be the most massive single star, but the system&#x27;s binary nature was proposed by the Brazilian astronomer Augusto Damineli in 1996 and confirmed in 2005. Both component stars are largely obscured by circumstellar material ejected from η Carinae A, and basic properties such as their temperatures and luminosities can only be inferred. Rapid changes to the stellar wind in the 21st century suggest that the star itself may be revealed when dust from the great eruption finally clears.

===Orbit===

The binary nature of η Carinae is clearly established, although the components have not been directly observed and cannot even be clearly resolved spectroscopically due to scattering and re-excitation in the surrounding nebulosity. Periodic photometric and spectroscopic variations prompted the search for a companion, and modelling of the colliding winds and partial &quot;eclipses&quot; of some spectroscopic features have constrained the possible orbits.

The period of the orbit is accurately known at 5.539 years, although this has changed over time due to mass loss and accretion. Between the Great Eruption and the smaller 1890 eruption, the orbital period was apparently 5.52 years, while before the Great Eruption it may have been lower still, possibly between 4.8 and 5.4 years. The orbital separation is only known approximately, with a semi-major axis of The orbit is highly eccentric, This means that the separation of the stars varies from around similar to the distance of Mars from the Sun, to 30 AU, similar to the distance of Neptune.

Perhaps the most valuable use of an accurate orbit for a binary star system is to directly calculate the masses of the stars. This requires the dimensions and inclination of the orbit to be accurately known. The dimensions of η Carinae&#x27;s orbit are only known approximately as the stars cannot be directly and separately observed. The inclination has been modelled at 130–145 degrees, but the orbit is still not known accurately enough to provide the masses of the two components.

===Classification===
η Carinae A is classified as a luminous blue variable (LBV) due to the distinctive spectral and brightness variations. This type of variable star is characterised by irregular changes from a high temperature quiescent state to a low temperature outburst state at roughly constant luminosity. LBVs in the quiescent state lie on a narrow instability strip, with more luminous stars being hotter. In outburst all LBVs have about the same temperature, which is near 8,000 K. LBVs in a normal outburst are visually brighter than when quiescent although the luminosity is unchanged.

An event similar to η Carinae A&#x27;s Great Eruption has been observed in only one other star in the Milky Way — — and in a handful of other possible LBVs in other galaxies. None of them seem to be quite as violent as η Carinae&#x27;s. It is unclear if this is something that only a very few of the most massive LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or a very brief but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.

η Carinae A is not a typical LBV. It is more luminous than any other LBV in the Milky Way although possibly comparable to other supernova impostors detected in external galaxies. It does not currently lie on the S Doradus instability strip, although it is unclear what the temperature or spectral type of the underlying star actually is, and during its Great Eruption it was much cooler than a typical LBV outburst, with a middle-G spectral type. The 1890 eruption may have been fairly typical of LBV eruptions, with an early F spectral type, and it has been estimated that the star may currently have an opaque stellar wind, forming a pseudo-photosphere with a temperature of 9,000–.

η Carinae B is a massive luminous hot star, about which little else is known. From certain high excitation spectral lines that ought not to be produced by the primary, η Carinae B is thought to be a young O-type star. Most authors suggest it is a somewhat evolved star such as a supergiant or giant, although a Wolf–Rayet star cannot be ruled out.

===Mass===
The masses of stars are difficult to measure except by determination of a binary orbit. η Carinae is a binary system, but certain key information about the orbit is not known accurately. The mass can be strongly constrained to be greater than , due to the high luminosity. Standard models of the system assume masses of and for the primary and secondary, respectively. Higher masses have been suggested, to model the energy output and mass transfer of the Great Eruption, with a combined system mass of over before the Great Eruption. η Carinae A has clearly lost a great deal of mass since it formed, and it is thought that it was initially , although it may have formed through binary merger. Masses of for the primary and for the secondary best-fit one-mass-transfer model of the Great Eruption event.

===Mass loss===

Mass loss is one of the most intensively studied aspects of massive star research. Put simply, calculated mass loss rates in the best models of stellar evolution do not reproduce the observed properties of evolved massive stars such as Wolf–Rayets, the number and types of core collapse supernovae, or their progenitors. To match those observations, the models require much higher mass loss rates. η Carinae A has one of the highest known mass loss rates, currently around /year, and is an obvious candidate for study.

η Carinae A is losing a lot of mass due to its extreme luminosity and relatively low surface gravity. Its stellar wind is entirely opaque and appears as a pseudo-photosphere; this optically dense surface hides any true physical surface of the star that may be present. (At extreme rates of radiative mass loss, the density gradient of lofted material may become continuous enough that a meaningfully discrete physical surface may not exist.) During the Great Eruption the mass loss rate was a thousand times higher, around /year sustained for ten years or more. The total mass loss during the eruption was at least with much of it now forming the Homunculus Nebula. The smaller 1890 eruption produced the Little Homunculus Nebula, much smaller and only about . The bulk of the mass loss occurs in a wind with a terminal velocity of about 420 km/s, but some material is seen at higher velocities, up to 3,200 km/s, possibly material blown from the accretion disk by the secondary star.

η Carinae B is presumably also losing mass via a thin, fast stellar wind, but this cannot be detected directly. Models of the radiation observed from interactions between the winds of the two stars show a mass loss rate of the order of /year at speeds of 3,000 km/s, typical of a hot O-class star. For a portion of the highly eccentric orbit, it may actually gain material from the primary via an accretion disk. During the Great Eruption of the primary, the secondary could have accreted , producing strong jets which formed the bipolar shape of the Homunculus Nebula.

===Luminosity===
The stars of the η Carinae system are completely obscured by dust and opaque stellar winds, with much of the ultraviolet and visual radiation shifted to infrared. The total electromagnetic radiation across all wavelengths for both stars combined is several million solar luminosities (). The best estimate for the luminosity of the primary is making it one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way. The luminosity of η Carinae B is particularly uncertain, probably and almost certainly no more than .

The most notable feature of η Carinae is its giant eruption or supernova impostor event, which originated in the primary star and was observed around 1843. In a few years, it produced almost as much visible light as a faint supernova explosion, but the star survived. It is estimated that at peak brightness the luminosity was as high as . Other supernova impostors have been seen in other galaxies, for example the possible false supernova SN 1961V in NGC 1058 and SN 2006jc&#x27;s pre-explosion outburst in UGC 4904.

Following the Great Eruption, η Carinae became self-obscured by the ejected material, resulting in dramatic reddening. This has been estimated at four magnitudes at visual wavelengths, meaning the post-eruption luminosity was comparable to the luminosity when first identified. η Carinae is still much brighter at infrared wavelengths, despite the presumed hot stars behind the nebulosity. The recent visual brightening is considered to be largely caused by a decrease in the extinction, due to thinning dust or a reduction in mass loss, rather than an underlying change in the luminosity.

===Temperature===

Until late in the 20th century, the temperature of η Carinae was assumed to be over 30,000 K because of the presence of high-excitation spectral lines, but other aspects of the spectrum suggested much lower temperatures and complex models were created to account for this. It is now known that the Eta Carinae system consists of at least two stars, both with strong stellar winds and a shocked colliding wind (wind-wind collision or WWC) zone, embedded within a dusty nebula that reprocesses 90% of the electromagnetic radiation into the mid and far infrared. All of these features have different temperatures.

The powerful stellar winds from the two stars collide in a roughly conical WWC zone and produce temperatures as high as at the apex between the two stars. This zone is the source of the hard X-rays and gamma rays close to the stars. Near periastron, as the secondary ploughs through ever denser regions of the primary wind, the colliding wind zone becomes distorted into a spiral trailing behind η Carinae B.

The wind-wind collision cone separates the winds of the two stars. For 55–75° behind the secondary, there is a thin hot wind typical of O or Wolf–Rayet stars. This allows some radiation from η Carinae B to be detected and its temperature can be estimated with some accuracy due to spectral lines that are unlikely to be produced by any other source. Although the secondary star has never been directly observed, there is widespread agreement on models where it has a temperature between 37,000 K and 41,000 K.

In all other directions on the other side of the wind-wind collision zone, there is the wind from η Carinae A, cooler and around 100 times denser than η Carinae B&#x27;s wind. It is also optically dense, completely obscuring anything resembling a true photosphere and rendering any definition of its temperature moot. The observable radiation originates from a pseudo-photosphere where the optical density of the wind drops to near zero, typically measured at a particular Rossland opacity value such as . This pseudo-photosphere is observed to be elongated and hotter along the presumed axis of rotation.

η Carinae A is likely to have appeared as an early B hypergiant with a temperature of between 20,000 K and 25,000 K at the time of its discovery by Halley. An effective temperature determined for the surface of a spherical optically thick wind at would be 9,400–15,000 K, while the temperature of a theoretical hydrostatic &quot;core&quot; at optical depth 150 would be 35,200 K. The effective temperature of the visible outer edge of the opaque primary wind is generally treated as being 15,000–25,000 K on the basis of visual and ultraviolet spectral features assumed to be directly from the wind or reflected via the Weigelt Blobs. During the great eruption, η Carinae A was much cooler at around 5,000 K.

The Homunculus contains dust at temperatures varying from 150 K to 400 K. This is the source of almost all the infrared radiation that makes η Carinae such a bright object at those wavelengths.

Further out, expanding gases from the Great Eruption collide with interstellar material and are heated to around , producing less energetic X-rays seen in a horseshoe or ring shape.

===Size===
The size of the two main stars in the η Carinae system is difficult to determine precisely, for neither star can be seen directly. η Carinae B is likely to have a well-defined photosphere, and its radius can be estimated from the assumed type of star. An O supergiant of with a temperature of 37,200 K has an effective radius of .

The size of η Carinae A is not even well defined. It has an optically dense stellar wind, so the typical definition of a star&#x27;s surface being approximately where it becomes opaque gives a very different result to where a more traditional definition of a surface might be. One study calculated a radius of for a hot &quot;core&quot; of 35,000 K at optical depth 150, near the sonic point or very approximately what might be called a physical surface. At optical depth 0.67 the radius would be , indicating an extended optically thick stellar wind. At the peak of the Great Eruption the radius, so far as such a thing is meaningful during such a violent expulsion of material, would have been around , comparable to the largest-known red supergiants, including VY Canis Majoris.

The stellar sizes should be compared with their orbital separation, which is only around at periastron. The accretion radius of the secondary is around , suggesting strong accretion near periastron leading to a collapse of the secondary wind. It has been proposed that the initial brightening from 4th magnitude to 1st at relatively constant bolometric luminosity was a normal LBV outburst, albeit from an extreme example of the class. Then the companion star passing through the expanded photosphere of the primary at periastron triggered the further brightening, increase in luminosity, and extreme mass loss of the Great Eruption.

===Rotation===
Rotation rates of massive stars have a critical influence on their evolution and eventual death. The rotation rate of the η Carinae stars cannot be measured directly because their surfaces cannot be seen. Single massive stars spin down quickly due to braking from their strong winds, but there are hints that both η Carinae A and B are fast rotators, up to 90% of critical velocity. One or both could have been spun up by binary interaction, for example accretion onto the secondary and orbital dragging on the primary.

==Eruptions==

Two eruptions have been observed from η Carinae, the Great Eruption of the mid-19th century and the Lesser Eruption of 1890. In addition, studies of outlying nebulosity suggest at least one earlier eruption around A further eruption may have occurred around although it is possible that the material indicating this eruption is actually from the Great Eruption slowed down by colliding with older nebulosity. The mechanism producing these eruptions is unknown. It is not even clear whether the eruptions involve explosive events or so-called super-Eddington winds, an extreme form of stellar wind involving very high mass loss induced by an increase in the luminosity of the star. The energy source for the explosions or luminosity increase is also unknown.

Theories about the various eruptions must account for: repeating events, at least three eruptions of various sizes; ejecting or more without destroying the star; the highly unusual shape and expansion rates of the ejected material; and the light curve during the eruptions involving a brightness increases of several magnitudes over a period of decades. The best-studied event is the Great Eruption. As well as photometry during the 19th century, light echoes observed in the 21st century give further information about the progression of the eruption, showing a brightening with multiple peaks for approximately 20 years, followed by a plateau period in the 1850s. The light echoes show that the outflow of material during the plateau phase was much higher than before the peak of the eruption. Possible explanations for the eruptions include: a binary merger in what was then a triple system; mass transfer from η Carinae B during periastron passages; or a pulsational pair-instability explosion.

==Evolution==

η Carinae is a unique object, with no very close analogues currently known in any galaxy. Therefore, its future evolution is highly uncertain, but almost certainly involves further mass loss and an eventual supernova.

η Carinae A would have begun life as an extremely hot star on the main sequence, already a highly luminous object over . The exact properties would depend on the initial mass, which is expected to have been at least and possibly much higher. A typical spectrum when first formed would be O2If and the star would be mostly or fully convective due to CNO cycle fusion at the very high core temperatures. Sufficiently massive or differentially rotating stars undergo such strong mixing that they remain chemically homogeneous during core hydrogen burning.

As core hydrogen burning progresses, a very massive star would slowly expand and become more luminous, becoming a blue hypergiant and eventually an LBV while still fusing hydrogen in the core. When hydrogen at the core is depleted after 2–2.5 million years, hydrogen shell burning continues with further increases in size and luminosity, although hydrogen shell burning in chemically homogeneous stars may be very brief or absent since the entire star would become depleted of hydrogen. In the late stages of hydrogen burning, mass loss is extremely high due to the high luminosity and enhanced surface abundances of helium and nitrogen. As hydrogen burning ends and core helium burning begins, massive stars transition very rapidly to the Wolf–Rayet stage with little or no hydrogen, increased temperatures and decreased luminosity. They are likely to have lost over half their initial mass at this point.

It is unclear whether triple-alpha helium fusion has started at the core of η Carinae A. The elemental abundances at the surface cannot be accurately measured, but ejecta within the Homunculus are around 60% hydrogen and 40% helium, with nitrogen enhanced to ten times solar levels. This is indicative of ongoing CNO cycle hydrogen fusion.

Models of the evolution and death of single very massive stars predict an increase in temperature during helium core burning, with the outer layers of the star being lost. It becomes a Wolf–Rayet star on the nitrogen sequence, moving from WNL to WNE as more of the outer layers are lost, possibly reaching the WC or WO spectral class as carbon and oxygen from the triple alpha process reach the surface. This process would continue with heavier elements being fused until an iron core develops, at which point the core collapses and the star is destroyed. Subtle differences in initial conditions, in the models themselves, and most especially in the rates of mass loss, produce different predictions for the final state of the most massive stars. They may survive to become a helium-stripped star or they may collapse at an earlier stage while they retain more of their outer layers. The lack of sufficiently luminous WN stars and the discovery of apparent LBV supernova progenitors has also prompted the suggestion that certain types of LBVs explode as a supernova without evolving further.

η Carinae is a close binary and this complicates the evolution of both stars. Compact massive companions can strip mass from larger primary stars much more quickly than would occur in a single star, so the properties at core collapse can be very different. In some scenarios, the secondary can accrue significant mass, accelerating its evolution, and in turn be stripped by the now compact Wolf–Rayet primary. In the case of η Carinae, the secondary is clearly causing additional instability in the primary, making it difficult to predict future developments.

===Potential supernova===

The overwhelming probability is that the next supernova observed in the Milky Way will originate from an unknown white dwarf or anonymous red supergiant, very likely not even visible to the naked eye. Nevertheless, the prospect of a supernova originating from an object as extreme, nearby, and well studied as η Carinae arouses great interest.

As a single star, a star originally around 150 times as massive as the Sun would typically reach core collapse as a Wolf–Rayet star within 3 million years. At low metallicity, many massive stars will collapse directly to a black hole with no visible explosion or a sub-luminous supernova, and a small fraction will produce a pair-instability supernova, but at solar metallicity and above, there is expected to be sufficient mass loss before collapse to allow a visible supernova of type Ib or Ic. If there is still a large amount of expelled material close to the star, the shock formed by the supernova explosion impacting the circumstellar material can efficiently convert kinetic energy to radiation, resulting in a superluminous supernova (SLSN) or hypernova, several times more luminous than a typical core collapse supernova and much longer-lasting. Highly massive progenitors may also eject sufficient nickel to cause a SLSN simply from the radioactive decay. The resulting remnant would be a black hole, for it is highly unlikely such a massive star could ever lose sufficient mass for its core not to exceed the limit for a neutron star.

The existence of a massive companion brings many other possibilities. If η Carinae A was rapidly stripped of its outer layers, it might be a less massive WC- or WO-type star when core collapse was reached. This would result in a type Ib or type Ic supernova due to the lack of hydrogen and possibly helium. This supernova type is thought to be the originator of certain classes of gamma-ray bursts, but models predict they occur only normally in less massive stars.

Several unusual supernovae and impostors have been compared to η Carinae as examples of its possible fate. One of the most compelling is SN 2009ip, a blue supergiant which underwent a supernova impostor event in 2009 with similarities to η Carinae&#x27;s Great Eruption, then an even brighter outburst in 2012 which is likely to have been a true supernova. SN 2006jc, some 77 million light-years away in UGC 4904, in the constellation Lynx, also underwent a supernova impostor brightening in 2004, followed by a magnitude 13.8 type Ib supernova, first seen on 9 October 2006. η Carinae has also been compared to other possible supernova impostors such as SN 1961V and iPTF14hls, and to superluminous supernovae such as SN 2006gy.

===Possible effects on Earth===

A typical core collapse supernova at the distance of η Carinae would peak at an apparent magnitude around −4, similar to Venus. A SLSN could be five magnitudes brighter, potentially the brightest supernova in recorded history (currently SN 1006). At 7,500 light-years from the star it is unlikely to directly affect terrestrial lifeforms, as they will be protected from gamma rays by the atmosphere and from some other cosmic rays by the magnetosphere. The main damage would be restricted to the upper atmosphere, the ozone layer, spacecraft, including satellites and any astronauts in space.

At least one paper has projected that complete loss of the Earth&#x27;s ozone layer is a plausible consequence of a &quot;nearby&quot; supernova, which would result in a significant increase in UV radiation reaching Earth&#x27;s surface from the Sun, but this would require a typical supernova to be closer than 50 light-years from Earth, and even a potential hypernova would need to be closer than η Carinae. Another analysis of the possible impact discusses more subtle effects from the unusual illumination, such as possible melatonin suppression with resulting insomnia and increased risk of cancer and depression. It concludes that a supernova of this magnitude would have to be much closer than η Carinae to have any type of major impact on Earth.

η Carinae is not expected to produce a gamma-ray burst, and its axis is not currently aimed near Earth. The Earth&#x27;s atmosphere protects its inhabitants from all the radiation apart from UV light (it is opaque to gamma rays, which have to be observed using space telescopes). The main effect would result from damage to the ozone layer. η Carinae is too far away to do that even if it did produce a gamma-ray burst.

<text>Lucifer is the name of two unrelated characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. One is an alien supervillain of the X-Men and the other is a villain of Ghost Rider and is referred to as the Prince of Darkness.

==Publication history==
The first Lucifer first appearance was in &quot;The X-Men&quot; #9 (Jan. 1965) and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. He is an agent of the Quists, an alien race who are also known as the Arcane.

==Fictional character biography==
===Lucifer (Quists)===

An alien, the being known as Lucifer was born on the planet Quistalium, in the Quistraa star system in the Milky Way Galaxy, who had invaded many worlds. He first came to Earth as an advance agent for the invasion of Earth by the Arcane (also known as the Quists), and succeeded in placing some humans under hypnotic control, allowing him to take control of a small area. This invasion, however, was foiled by the young Charles Xavier (later Professor X, leader of the X-Men). In retaliation, Lucifer dropped an enormous stone block on Xavier, leaving his legs paralyzed so that he would need a wheelchair.

Lucifer made several later attempts to conquer Earth, all foiled by the X-Men or other heroes, although one of his attempts did force the first X-Men team to confront the Avengers due to a misunderstanding.

Lucifer returned to Earth years after paralyzing Xavier, and battled Professor Xavier once again in the Balkan Mountains, where he revealed a device attached to his heart would set off a bomb if he was killed. Lucifer later manipulated the Blob and Unus into framing the X-Men as criminals. He revealed how he rendered Xavier a paraplegic years ago. He was thwarted by the X-Men who defeated his robot, and teleported from Earth by the Quistalian Supreme one for punishment.

Lucifer was exiled to an alternate realm known as the &quot;Nameless Dimension&quot;. There, he somehow used &quot;ionic energy&quot; to give himself superhuman strength and the ability to project force beams from his hands, in addition to his apparently pre-existing telepathic powers. He continued to try conquering Earth by using his &quot;dimensional transmitter&quot; to imbue humans with ionic energy and turning them into his minions. He first &quot;fused&quot; with Charlie Gray, although Gray fought and defeated Lucifer. Lucifer later fused simultaneously with criminal Rafe Michel and Aries of the Zodiac crime cartel. Michel and Aries fought Captain America and the Falcon. Lucifer became trapped in the &quot;Nameless Dimension&quot; again when both hosts died. Lucifer&#x27;s masters ultimately apparently &quot;terminated&quot; him for his failures, and replaced him with the computer Dominus.

===Lucifer (Prince of Darkness)===
Lucifer is a supervillain in Marvel Comics, mostly associated with Ghost Rider.

Lucifer possesses a vast array of powers. Deception, suggestion and manipulation are quite appealing to this creature, but he is not above tearing his opponents apart with his bare claws.

Lucifer has kept his true history mysterious throughout the years through deceit and deception. It is believed that he was once an angel who led other angels in banishing the N&#x27;Garai from Earth and led a group of followers in a rebellion against &quot;God&quot; during the great war in Heaven, thus essentially representing the true &quot;devil&quot; in the Marvel Universe of Christian theology. Following his defeat, Lucifer and his lieutenants Beelzeboul, Kazann, Malachi, Pazuzu, Xaphan and others were all cast down to Hell as punishment. During this time, he became the demon known as the Prince of Lies, ruling a realm in Hell.

In Hell, Lucifer looked nothing like the angel he once was. He and all of his Lieutenants had degenerated into demons; some through instruction, others adapted more naturally. But they had all over time changed into twisted creatures of evil.

A long battle has been fought between the demon Ghost Rider and the Prince of Lies. Lucifer believed (as have others) that if he could extinguish the human soul that lives within the Ghost Rider, the latter could be made into a soulless killing machine that could be used to extinguish all humanity. Later he introduces many more reasons to defeat Johnny Blaze. For years, Lucifer with the aid of the other Hell-lords had made many attempts on Ghost Rider&#x27;s soul, but all have failed. Lucifer had decided to take matters into his own hands. Satan wanted to capitalize on this particular demon as well as to join in for his own purposes. But in the end Ghost Rider proved he was a very strong demon indeed.

Lucifer is ultimately defeated by Blaze and exiled back to Perdition, and senses Zadkiel&#x27;s apparent triumph over Heaven from Hell. However, after Zadkiel is unable to truly control Creation and the ultimate power that sparked it, the one true God returns in wrath and condemns the renegade archangel to Hell for all eternity, to be forever tortured by a pleased Lucifer. 

During a later storyline, Lucifer is able to escape from Hell by &#x27;following&#x27; Ghost Rider during his latest escape from Hell, with the transition splintering Lucifer&#x27;s soul into 666 fragments, which &#x27;manifest&#x27; on Earth in the bodies of those who had recently died at the moment Ghost Rider crossed over, with these including the latest Jack O&#x27;Lantern. Lucifer would regain his full strength if he can arrange for his various hosts to be killed by others; he cannot commit suicide as this is a sin that would send him back to Hell, but as each Lucifer fragment dies, their strengths are transferred to the other hosts, until eventually the last few hosts will be so powerful only Ghost Rider can kill him, at which point the last &#x27;living&#x27; Lucifer would serve as the final manifestation of Lucifer himself. Eventually, the Ghost Rider is able to &#x27;kill&#x27; one Lucifer fragment by ramming a truck&#x27;s gear-stick through its brain and breaking its spine, leaving the fragment in a brain-damaged and paralysed state but biologically still alive, allowing Ghost Rider to defeat what Lucifer believes to be his final host because it is still at half-strength, the brain-dead final host being killed by Ghost Rider&#x27;s ally Dixie- a trucker Blaze had befriended earlier- and the police.

As the Chaos King launches his invasion of the divine and infernal realms associated with Earth at the start of the &quot;Chaos War&quot; storyline, the last surviving bastion of Creation, Lucifer, along with the other powers of Hell, confronts Mikaboshi, only to be defeated and consumed by the overwhelming might of his primordial darkness.

==Powers and abilities==
The Quist version of Lucifer has a gifted intellect, and extensive knowledge of advanced Quistalian science and technology, and talent as an inventor using this technology. Lucifer has acquired the ability to manipulate ionic energy for various effects, including enhancing his physical strength and leaping ability to superhuman levels, creating protective force fields, and projecting powerful concussive bolts. Lucifer could also &quot;fuse&quot; his physical and mental &quot;essence&quot; with another sentient being. In doing so, Lucifer created a psychic link between himself and his &quot;host.&quot; The &quot;host&quot; retained his own will but was in constant psychic contact with Lucifer. The &quot;fusion&quot; endowed the host with some of Lucifer&#x27;s superhuman powers for as long as the merger lasted. Lucifer could fuse with at least two hosts simultaneously. Lucifer also had limited telepathic abilities, and had the ability to create and maintain a psychic link with his host or hosts while fused with them. Lucifer used a ray gun firing unknown forms of destructive energy. He later made use of Dominus, a highly advanced computer complex created by the Arcane that could blanket a world with mind-deadening rays, enabling the Arcane to enslave its populace. Dominus was operated by &quot;Ultra-robots,&quot; which could fly and project destructive energy beams. Lucifer also used teleportation devices for transportation. All of this paraphernalia was designed by Lucifer himself and Quistalian scientists.

The demon version of Lucifer can create interdimensional portals, perform image projection, demonic possession, do mystical force blasts, illusion casting, shapeshifting, sizeshifting, matter manipulation, raising the dead, manipulating the dead, and regenerating the corpses of those he inhabits. Lucifer doesn&#x27;t need to eat, drink, or sleep. He is also immune to aging and disease.

==In other media==
In the novel &quot;Shadows of the Past&quot; by Michael Jan Friedman, the alien Lucifer is revealed to be alive, capturing Professor X and replacing him with an ionic energy duplicate, the duplicate possessing the real Xavier&#x27;s memories and powers while nevertheless unquestionably loyal to Lucifer. In the process, Lucifer also traps Xavier in the Nameless Dimension with him, the Nameless Dimension being depicted as a featureless realm filled with a thick liquid-like substance that Lucifer and Xavier can &#x27;breathe&#x27; as though they are still inhaling oxygen. Although Lucifer is able to create beings made of pure ionic energy, his ability to create such beings is apparently limited, and they are of limited capabilities; two such beings were able to defeat Xavier and Iceman and abduct Xavier only because they had the element of surprise and raw power as well as being immune to telepathy. Due to the limitations of these constructs and his own twisted sense of irony, Lucifer has the duplicate Xavier use the original X-Men as his agents, sending them to acquire three components from Quistalian outposts around the globe. The duplicate Xavier intends to use these components to alter the machine that had sent the Professor into the Nameless Dimension so that it could be used to allow Lucifer to return to Earth, the duplicate claiming to the X-Men that he could use those components to devise a machine to protect Earth from future Quistalian invasion. Xavier attempts to warn his students, but although he can telepathically penetrate the dimensional barrier to witness events back on Earth, his abilities are subsequently too weak to access the complex minds of either Beast or Jean Grey. Fortunately, Xavier was able to make contact with Jeffery Saunders, the mentally handicapped grandson of a recently deceased friend, whose limited mental state made him more &#x27;open&#x27; to Xavier&#x27;s influence. Using Jeffrey&#x27;s physically superior body - the young boy being an exceptional athlete despite his mental state - the Professor was able to alert the X-Men to the deception when the duplicate Xavier just tried to have Jeffrey sent home when he first came to the mansion; Iceman had witnessed the real Xavier interacting with Jeremy at his grandfather&#x27;s funeral, and was struck by how the duplicate was acting far more distant towards Jeffrey. With the duplicate Xavier captured, Xavier-in-Jeffrey accompanied the X-Men when they departed to retrieve the final component, and was later able to defeat an ionic duplicate of Archangel - created after the original was injured and captured while they were investigating one of the facilities - that could have allowed Lucifer to use the newly modified portal to return to their dimension. Although Xavier was briefly tempted to destroy the machine when he thought that Lucifer might be able to reach the exit portal before him, Jeffrey was able to help him escape by &#x27;sending&#x27; the Professor his own youthful energy back along their psychic link, giving Xavier the strength to beat Lucifer to the portal in a swimming race, the portal being deactivated just as Lucifer&#x27;s hand attempted to emerge after Xavier. With Xavier&#x27;s return, the machine was destroyed by Cyclops and the duplicate Professor X is found to have ceased to exist, leaving Lucifer to fume and plot his revenge in the Nameless Dimension once again.

<doc id="92388" wikidata="Q408223" url="?curid=92388" title="Cytochrome c">
<text>The cytochrome complex, or cyt c, is a small hemeprotein found loosely associated with the inner membrane of the mitochondrion where it plays a critical role in cellular respiration. 
It transfers electrons between Complexes III (Coenzyme Q – Cyt c reductase) and IV (Cyt c oxidase). Cytochrome c is highly water-soluble, unlike other cytochromes. It is capable of undergoing oxidation and reduction as its iron atom converts between the ferrous and ferric forms, but does not bind oxygen. It also plays a major role in cell apoptosis. In humans, cytochrome c is encoded by the &quot;CYCS&quot; gene.

== Species distribution ==

Cytochrome c is a highly conserved protein across the spectrum of eukaryotic species, found in plants, animals, fungi, and many unicellular organisms. This, along with its small size (molecular weight about 12,000 daltons), makes it useful in studies of cladistics. Cytochrome c has been studied for the glimpse it gives into evolutionary biology.

Cytochrome c has a primary structure consisting of a chain of about 100 amino acids. Many higher-order organisms possess a chain of 104 amino acids. The sequence of cytochrome c in humans is identical to that of chimpanzees (our closest relatives), but differs from that of horses.

Cytochrome c has an amino acid sequence that is highly conserved in eukaryotes, varying by only a few residues. In more than thirty species tested in one study, 34 of the 104 amino acids were conserved (identical at their characteristic position). For example, human cytochrome oxidase reacted with wheat cytochrome &quot;c&quot;, &quot;in vitro&quot;; which held true for all pairs of species tested. In addition, the redox potential of +0.25 volts is the same in all cytochrome &quot;c&quot; molecules studied.

== Structure ==

Cytochrome c belongs to class I of the c-type cytochrome family and contains a characteristic CXXCH (cysteine-any-any-cysteine-histidine) amino acid motif that binds heme. This motif is located towards the N-terminus of the peptide chain and contains a histidine as the 5th ligand of the heme iron. The 6th ligand is provided by a methionine residue found towards the C-terminus. The protein backbone is folded into five α-helices that are numbered α1-α5 from N-terminus to C-terminus. Helices α3, α4 and α5 are referred to as 50s, 60s and 70s helices, respectively, when referring to mitochondrial cytochrome c.

=== Heme c ===

While most heme proteins are attached to the prosthetic group through iron ion ligation and tertiary interactions, the heme group of cytochrome c makes thioether bonds with two cysteine side chains of the protein. One of the main properties of heme c, which allows cytochrome c to have variety of functions, is its ability to have different reduction potentials in nature. This property determines the kinetics and thermodynamics of an electron transfer reaction.

=== Dipole moment ===

The dipole moment has an important role in orienting proteins to the proper directions and enhancing their abilities to bind to other molecules. The dipole moment of cytochrome c results from a cluster of negatively charged amino acid side chains at the &quot;back&quot; of the enzyme. Despite variations in the number of bound heme groups and variations in sequence, the dipole moment of vertebrate cytochromes c is remarkably conserved. For example, vertebrate cytochromes c all have a dipole moment of approximately 320 debye while cytochromes c of plants and insects have a dipole moment of approximately 340 debye.

== Function ==

=== Electron transport chain ===
Cytochrome c is an essential component of the respiratory electron transport chain in mitochondria. The heme group of cytochrome c accepts electrons from the bc Complex III and transports them to Complex IV, while it transfers energy in the opposite direction. 

Cytochrome c can also catalyze several redox reactions such as hydroxylation and aromatic oxidation, and shows peroxidase activity by oxidation of various electron donors such as 2,2-azino-&quot;bis&quot;(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), 2-keto-4-thiomethyl butyric acid and 4-aminoantipyrine. 

A bacterial cytochrome &quot;c&quot; functions as a nitrite reductase.

=== Role in apoptosis ===

Cytochrome c was also discovered in 1996 by Xiaodong Wang to have an intermediate role in apoptosis, a controlled form of cell death used to kill cells in the process of development or in response to infection or DNA damage.

Cytochrome c binds to cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane, thus anchoring its presence and keeping it from releasing out of the mitochondria and initiating apoptosis. While the initial attraction between cardiolipin and cytochrome c is electrostatic due to the extreme positive charge on cytochrome c, the final interaction is hydrophobic, where a hydrophobic tail from cardiolipin inserts itself into the hydrophobic portion of cytochrome c. 

During the early phase of apoptosis, mitochondrial ROS production is stimulated, and cardiolipin is oxidized by a peroxidase function of the cardiolipin–cytochrome c complex. The hemoprotein is then detached from the mitochondrial inner membrane and can be extruded into the soluble cytoplasm through pores in the outer membrane.

The sustained elevation in calcium levels precedes cyt &quot;c&quot; release from the mitochondria. The release of small amounts of cyt &quot;c&quot; leads to an interaction with the IP3 receptor (IP3R) on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causing ER calcium release. The overall increase in calcium triggers a massive release of cyt &quot;c&quot;, which then acts in the positive feedback loop to maintain ER calcium release through the IP3Rs. This explains how the ER calcium release can reach cytotoxic levels. This release of cytochrome c in turn activates caspase 9, a cysteine protease. Caspase 9 can then go on to activate caspase 3 and caspase 7, which are responsible for destroying the cell from within. 

=== Inhibition of apoptosis ===

One of the ways cell apoptosis is activated is by release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into cytosol. A study has shown that cells are able to protect themselves from apoptosis by blocking the release of cytochrome c using Bcl-xL. Another way that cells can control apoptosis is by phosphorylation of Tyr48, which would turn cytochrome c into an anti-apoptotic switch.

=== As an antioxidative enzyme ===

In addition to its well-known roles in the electron transport chain and cell apoptosis, according to a recent study cytochrome c can also act as an antioxidative enzyme in the mitochondria; it does so by removing superoxide () and hydrogen peroxide (HO) from mitochondria. Therefore, not only is cytochrome c required in the mitochondria for cellular respiration, but it is also needed in the mitochondria to limit the production of and .

== Extramitochondrial localisation ==

Cytochrome c is widely believed to be localised solely in the mitochondrial intermembrane space under normal physiological conditions. The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, where it activates the caspase family of proteases, is believed to be the primary trigger leading to the onset of apoptosis. Measuring the amount of cytochrome c leaking from mitochondria to cytosol, and out of the cell to culture medium, is a sensitive method to monitor the degree of apoptosis. However, detailed immuno-electronmicroscopic studies with rat tissues sections employing cytochrome c specific antibodies provide compelling evidence that cytochrome c under normal cellular conditions is also present at extramitochondrial locations. In pancreatic acinar cells and the anterior pituitary, strong and specific presence of cytochrome c was detected in zymogen granules and in growth hormone granules, respectively. In the pancreas, cytochrome c was also found in condensing vacuoles and in the acinar lumen. The extramitochondrial localisation of cytochrome c was shown to be specific as it was completely abolished upon adsorption of the primary antibody with purified cytochrome c. Besides cytochrome c, extramitochondrial localisation has also been observed for large numbers of other proteins including those encoded by mitochondrial DNA. This raises the possibility of the existence of yet-unidentified specific mechanisms for protein translocation from mitochondria to other cellular destinations.

== Applications ==

=== Superoxide detection ===

Cytochrome c has been used to detect peroxide production in biological systems. As superoxide is produced, the number of oxidised cytochrome c3+ increases, and reduced cytochrome c2+ decreases. However, superoxide is often produced with nitric oxide. In the presence of nitric oxide, the reduction of cytochrome c3+ is inhibited. This leads to the oxidisation of cytochrome c to cytochrome c by peroxynitrous acid, an intermediate made through the reaction of nitric oxide and superoxide. Presence of peroxynitrite or HO and nitrogen dioxide NO in the mitochondria can be lethal since they nitrate tyrosine residues of cytochrome c, which leads to disruption of cytochrome c&#x27;s function as an electron carrier in the electron transport chain.

=== As an enzyme for Catalytic Activity ===
Cytochrome C has also been widely studied as an enzyme with peroxidase-like activity. Cytochrome C was conjugated to charged polymer to test its peroxidase-like activity. Inspired from natural examples of enzyme encapsulation in protein-based cage structures (Example: Carboxysomes, Ferritin and Encapsulin), Cytochrome C was encapsulated in a 9 nm small self-assembling DNA binding protein from nutrient starved cells (Dps) protein cage using chimeric self-assembly approach. Authors observed unique catalytic activity behavior upon encapsulating enzyme inside a protein-cage, which was different from enzyme in solution. This was attributed to local microenvironment provided by Dps nanocage&#x27;s interior cavity which is different than bulk.

<doc id="92389" wikidata="Q181332" url="?curid=92389" title="Zeolite">
<text>Zeolite is a group of several microporous, crystalline aluminosilicate minerals commonly used as commercial adsorbents and catalysts. They mainly consist of silicon, aluminium, oxygen, and have the general formula ･y where is either a metal ion or H+.

The term was originally coined in 1756 by Swedish mineralogist Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who observed that rapidly heating a material, believed to have been stilbite, produced large amounts of steam from water that had been adsorbed by the material. Based on this, he called the material &quot;zeolite&quot;, from the Greek , meaning &quot;to boil&quot; and , meaning &quot;stone&quot;.

Zeolites occur naturally, but are also produced industrially on a large scale. , 253 unique zeolite frameworks have been identified, and over 40 naturally occurring zeolite frameworks are known. Every new zeolite structure that is obtained is examined by the International Zeolite Association Structure Commission (IZA-SC) and receives a three-letter designation.

==Characteristics==
===Properties===
Zeolites are white solids with ordinary handling properties, like many routine aluminosilicate minerals, e.g. feldspar. They have the general formula where M+ is usually H+ and Na+. The Si/Al ratio is variable, which provides a means to tune the properties. Zeolites with a Si/Al ratios higher than about 3 are classified as high-silica zeolites, which tend to be more hydrophobic. The H+ and Na+ can be replaced by diverse cations, because zeolites have ion exchange properties. The nature of the cations influences the porosity of zeolites. 

Zeolites have microporous structures with a typical diameter of 0.3–0.8 nm. Like most aluminosilicates, the framework is formed by linking of aluminum and silicon atoms by oxides. This linking leads to a 3-dimensional network of Si-O-Al, Si-O-Si, and Al-O-Al linkages. The aluminum centers are negatively charged, which requires an accompanying cation. These cations are hydrated during the formation of the materials. The hydrated cations interrupt the otherwise dense network of Si-O-Al, Si-O-Si, and Al-O-Al linkage, leading to regular water-filled cavities. Because of the porosity of the zeolite, the water can exit the material through channels. Because of the rigidity of the zeolite framework, the loss of water does not result in collapse of the cavities and channels. This aspect – the ability to generate voids within the solid material – underpins the ability of zeolites to function as catalysts. They possess high physical and chemical stability due to the large covalent bonding contribution. They have excellent hydrophobicity and are suited for adsorption of bulky, hydrophobic molecules such as hydrocarbons. In addition to that, high-silica zeolites are exchangeable, unlike natural zeolites, and are used as solid acid catalysts. The acidity is strong enough to protonate hydrocarbons and high-silica zeolites are used in acid catalysis processes such as fluid catalytic cracking in petrochemical industry.

===Framework structure===
The structures of hundreds of zeolites have been determined. Most do not occur naturally. For each structure, the International Zeolite Association (IZA) gives a three-letter code called framework type code (FTC). For example, the major molecular sieves, 3A, 4A and 5A, are all LTA (Linde Type A). Most commercially available natural zeolites are of the MOR, HEU or ANA-types.

An example of the notation of the ring structure of zeolite and other silicate materials is shown in the upper right figure. The middle figure shows a common notation using structural formula. The left figure emphasizes the SiO tetrahedral structure. Connecting oxygen atoms together creates a four-membered ring of oxygen (blue bold line). In fact, such a ring substructure is called four membered ring or simply four-ring. The figure on the right shows a 4-ring with Si atoms connected to each other, which is the most common way to express the topology of the framework.

The figure on the right compares the typical framework structures of LTA (left) and FAU (right). Both zeolites share the truncated octahedral structure (sodalite cage) (purple line). However, the way they are connected (yellow line) is different: in LTA, the four-membered rings of the cage are connected to each other to form a skeleton, while in FAU, the six-membered rings are connected to each other. As a result, the pore entrance of LTA is an 8-ring (0.41 nm) and belongs to the small pore zeolite, while the pore entrance of FAU is a 12-ring (0.74 nm) and belongs to the large pore zeolite, respectively. Materials with a 10-ring are called medium pore zeolites, a typical example being ZSM-5 (MFI).

Although more than 200 types of zeolites are known, only about 100 types of aluminosilicate are available. In addition, there are only a few types that can be synthesized in industrially feasible way and have sufficient thermal stability to meet the requirements for industrial use. In particular, the FAU (faujasite, USY), *BEA (beta), MOR (high-silica mordenite), MFI (ZSM-5), and FER (high-silica ferrierite) types are called the big five of high silica zeolites, and industrial production methods have been established.

===Porosity===
The term molecular sieve refers to a particular property of these materials, i.e., the ability to selectively sort molecules based primarily on a size exclusion process. This is due to a very regular pore structure of molecular dimensions. The maximum size of the molecular or ionic species that can enter the pores of a zeolite is controlled by the dimensions of the channels. These are conventionally defined by the ring size of the aperture, where, for example, the term &quot;eight-ring&quot; refers to a closed-loop that is built from eight tetrahedrally coordinated silicon (or aluminium) atoms and eight oxygen atoms. These rings are not always perfectly symmetrical due to a variety of causes, including strain induced by the bonding between units that are needed to produce the overall structure or coordination of some of the oxygen atoms of the rings to cations within the structure. Therefore, the pores in many zeolites are not cylindrical.

===Isomorphous substitution===
Isomorphous substitution of Si in zeolites can be possible for some heteroatoms such as titanium, zinc and germanium. Al atoms in zeolites can be also structurally replaced with boron and gallium.

The silicoaluminophosphate type (AlPO molecular sieve), in which Si is isomorphous with Al and P and Al is isomorphous with Si, and the gallogermanate and others are known.

==Natural occurrence==
Some of the more common mineral zeolites are analcime, chabazite, clinoptilolite, heulandite, natrolite, phillipsite, and stilbite. An example of the mineral formula of a zeolite is: ·2H2O, the formula for natrolite.

Natural zeolites form where volcanic rocks and ash layers react with alkaline groundwater. Zeolites also crystallize in post-depositional environments over periods ranging from thousands to millions of years in shallow marine basins. Naturally occurring zeolites are rarely pure and are contaminated to varying degrees by other minerals, metals, quartz, or other zeolites. For this reason, naturally occurring zeolites are excluded from many important commercial applications where uniformity and purity are essential.

Zeolites transform to other minerals under weathering, hydrothermal alteration or metamorphic conditions. Some examples:
* The sequence of silica-rich volcanic rocks commonly progresses from:
** Clay → quartz → mordenite–heulandite → epistilbite → stilbite → thomsonite → mesolite → scolecite → chabazite → calcite.
* The sequence of silica-poor volcanic rocks commonly progresses from:
** Cowlesite → levyne → offretite → analcime → thomsonite → mesolite → scolecite → chabazite → calcite.

=== Gemstones ===

Thomsonites, one of the rarer zeolite minerals, have been collected as gemstones from a series of lava flows along Lake Superior in Minnesota and, to a lesser degree, in Michigan. Thomsonite nodules from these areas have eroded from basalt lava flows and are collected on beaches and by scuba divers in Lake Superior.

These thomsonite nodules have concentric rings in combinations of colors: black, white, orange, pink, purple, red, and many shades of green. Some nodules have copper inclusions and rarely will be found with copper &quot;eyes&quot;. When polished by a lapidary, the thomsonites sometimes displays a &quot;cat&#x27;s eye&quot; effect (chatoyancy).

==Production==
The first synthetic structure was reported by Richard Barrer. Industrially important zeolites are produced synthetically. Typical procedures entail heating aqueous solutions of alumina and silica with sodium hydroxide. Equivalent reagents include sodium aluminate and sodium silicate. Further variations include the use of structure directing agents (SDA) such as quaternary ammonium cations.

Synthetic zeolites hold some key advantages over their natural analogs. The synthetic materials are manufactured in a uniform, phase-pure state. It is also possible to produce zeolite structures that do not appear in nature. Zeolite A is a well-known example. Since the principal raw materials used to manufacture zeolites are silica and alumina, which are among the most abundant mineral components on earth, the potential to supply zeolites is virtually unlimited.

===Ore mining===

, the world&#x27;s annual production of natural zeolite approximates 3 million tonnes. Major producers in 2010 included China (2 million tonnes), South Korea (210,000 t), Japan (150,000 t), Jordan (140,000 t), Turkey (100,000 t) Slovakia (85,000 t) and the United States (59,000 t). The ready availability of zeolite-rich rock at low cost and the shortage of competing minerals and rocks are probably the most important factors for its large-scale use. According to the United States Geological Survey, it is likely that a significant percentage of the material sold as zeolites in some countries is ground or sawn volcanic tuff that contains only a small amount of zeolites. These materials are used for construction, e.g. dimension stone (as an altered volcanic tuff), lightweight aggregate, pozzolanic cement, and soil conditioners.

===Synthesis===

Over 200 synthetic zeolites have been reported. Most zeolites have aluminosilicate frameworks but some incorporate germanium, iron, gallium, boron, zinc, tin, and titanium. Zeolite synthesis involves sol-gel-like processes. The product properties depend on reaction mixture composition, pH of the system, operating temperature, pre-reaction &#x27;seeding&#x27; time, reaction time as well as the templates used. In the sol-gel process, other elements (metals, metal oxides) can be easily incorporated.

== Applications ==

Zeolites are widely used as catalysts and sorbents. In chemistry, zeolites are used as membranes to separate molecules (only molecules of certain sizes and shapes can pass through), and as traps for molecules so they can be analyzed.

Research into and development of the many biochemical and biomedical applications of zeolites, particularly the naturally occurring species heulandite, clinoptilolite, and chabazite has been ongoing.

=== Ion-exchange, water purification and softening ===

Zeolites are widely used as ion-exchange beds in domestic and commercial water purification, softening, and other applications.

Evidence for the oldest known zeolite water purification filtration system occurs in the undisturbed sediments of the Corriental reservoir at the Maya city of Tikal, in northern Guatemala.

Earlier, polyphosphates were used to soften hard water. The polyphosphates forms complex with metal ions like Ca2+ and Mg2+ to bind them up so that they could not interfere in cleaning process. However, when this phosphate rich water goes in main stream water, it results in eutrophication of water bodies and hence use of polyphosphate was replaced with use of a synthetic zeolite.

The largest single use for zeolite is the global laundry detergent market. Zeolites are used in laundry detergent as water softeners, removing Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions which would otherwise precipitate from the solution. The ions are retained by the zeolites which releases Na+ ions into the solution, allowing the laundry detergent to be effective in areas with hard water.

=== Catalysis ===

Synthetic zeolites, like other mesoporous materials (e.g., MCM-41), are widely used as catalysts in the petrochemical industry, such as in fluid catalytic cracking and hydrocracking. Zeolites confine molecules into small spaces, which causes changes in their structure and reactivity. The acidic forms of zeolites prepared are often powerful solid-state solid acids, facilitating a host of acid-catalyzed reactions, such as isomerization, alkylation, and cracking.

Catalytic cracking uses a reactor and a regenerator. Feed is injected onto a hot, fluidized catalyst where large gasoil molecules are broken into smaller gasoline molecules and olefins. The vapor-phase products are separated from the catalyst and distilled into various products. The catalyst is circulated to a regenerator, where the air is used to burn coke off the surface of the catalyst that was formed as a byproduct in the cracking process. The hot, regenerated catalyst is then circulated back to the reactor to complete its cycle.

Zeolites containing cobalt nanoparticles have applications in the recycling industry as a catalyst to break down polyethylene and polypropylene, two widely used plastics, into propane.

=== Nuclear waste reprocessing ===
Zeolites have been used in advanced nuclear reprocessing methods, where their micro-porous ability to capture some ions while allowing others to pass freely allows many fission products to be efficiently removed from the waste and permanently trapped. Equally important are the mineral properties of zeolites. Their alumino-silicate construction is extremely durable and resistant to radiation, even in porous form. Additionally, once they are loaded with trapped fission products, the zeolite-waste combination can be hot-pressed into an extremely durable ceramic form, closing the pores and trapping the waste in a solid stone block. This is a waste form factor that greatly reduces its hazard, compared to conventional reprocessing systems. Zeolites are also used in the management of leaks of radioactive materials. For example, in the aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, sandbags of zeolite were dropped into the seawater near the power plant to adsorb the radioactive cesium-137 that was present in high levels.

===Gas separation and storage===
Zeolites have the potential of providing precise and specific separation of gases, including the removal of H2O, CO2, and SO2 from low-grade natural gas streams. Other separations include noble gases, N2, O2, freon, and formaldehyde.

On-board oxygen generating systems (OBOGS) and oxygen concentrators use zeolites in conjunction with pressure swing adsorption to remove nitrogen from compressed air to supply oxygen for aircrews at high altitudes, as well as home and portable oxygen supplies.
Zeolite-based oxygen concentrator systems are widely used to produce medical-grade oxygen. The zeolite is used as a molecular sieve to create purified oxygen from air using its ability to trap impurities, in a process involving the adsorption of nitrogen, leaving highly purified oxygen and up to 5% argon.

The German group Fraunhofer e.V. announced that they had developed a zeolite substance for use in the biogas industry for long-term storage of energy at a density four times greater than water. Ultimately, the goal is to store heat both in industrial installations and in small combined heat and power plants such as those used in larger residential buildings.

Debbie Meyer Green Bags, a produce storage and preservation product, uses a form of zeolite as its active ingredient. The bags are lined with zeolite to adsorb ethylene, which is intended to slow the ripening process and extend the shelf life of produce stored in the bags.

Clinoptilolite has also been added to chicken food: the absorption of water and ammonia by the zeolite made the birds&#x27; droppings drier and less odoriferous, hence easier to handle.

Zeolites are also used as a molecular sieve in cryosorption style vacuum pumps.

===Solar energy storage and use===
Zeolites can be used to thermochemically store solar heat harvested from solar thermal collectors as first demonstrated by Guerra in 1978 and for adsorption refrigeration, as first demonstrated by Tchernev in 1974. In these applications, their high heat of adsorption and ability to hydrate and dehydrate while maintaining structural stability is exploited. This hygroscopic property coupled with an inherent exothermic (energy releasing) reaction when transitioning from a dehydrated form to a hydrated form make natural zeolites useful in harvesting waste heat and solar heat energy.

=== Building materials ===

Synthetic zeolites are used as an additive in the production process of warm mix asphalt concrete. The development of this application started in Germany in the 1990s. They help by decreasing the temperature level during manufacture and laying of asphalt concrete, resulting in lower consumption of fossil fuels, thus releasing less carbon dioxide, aerosols, and vapors. The use of synthetic zeolites in hot mixed asphalt leads to easier compaction and, to a certain degree, allows cold weather paving and longer hauls.

When added to Portland cement as a pozzolan, they can reduce chloride permeability and improve workability. They reduce weight and help moderate water content while allowing for slower drying, which improves break strength. When added to lime mortars and lime-metakaolin mortars, synthetic zeolite pellets can act simultaneously as a pozzolanic material and a water reservoir.

=== Cat litter ===

Non-clumping cat litter is often made of zeolite (or diatomite), one form of which, invented at MIT, can sequester the greenhouse gas methane from the atmosphere.

=== Hemostatic agent ===

The original formulation of QuikClot brand hemostatic agent, which is used to stop severe bleeding, contained zeolite granules. When in contact with blood, the granules would rapidly absorb water from the blood plasma, creating an exothermic reaction which generated heat. The absorption of water would also concentrate clotting factors present within the blood, causing the clot formation process to occur much faster than under normal circumstances, as shown in vitro.

The 2022 formulation of QuikClot uses a nonwoven material impregnated with kaolin, an inorganic mineral activating Factor XII, in turn accelerating natural clotting. Unlike the original zeolite formulation, kaolin does not exhibit any thermogenic properties.

=== Soil treatment ===
In agriculture, clinoptilolite (a naturally occurring zeolite) is used as a soil treatment. It provides a source of slowly released potassium. If previously loaded with ammonium, the zeolite can serve a similar function in the slow release of nitrogen.

Zeolites can also act as water moderators, in which they will absorb up to 55% of their weight in water and slowly release it under the plant&#x27;s demand. This property can prevent root rot and moderate drought cycles.

=== Aquaria ===

Pet stores market zeolites for use as filter additives in aquaria, where they can be used to adsorb ammonia and other nitrogenous compounds. Due to the high affinity of some zeolites for calcium, they may be less effective in hard water and may deplete calcium. Zeolite filtration is also used in some marine aquaria to keep nutrient concentrations low for the benefit of corals adapted to nutrient-depleted waters.

Where and how the zeolite was formed is an important consideration for aquarium applications. Most Northern hemisphere, natural zeolites were formed when molten lava came into contact with sea water, thereby &quot;loading&quot; the zeolite with Na (sodium) sacrificial ions. The mechanism is well known to chemists as ion exchange. These sodium ions can be replaced by other ions in solution, thus the take-up of nitrogen in ammonia, with the release of the sodium. A deposit near Bear River in southern Idaho is a fresh water variety (Na &lt; 0.05%). Southern hemisphere zeolites are typically formed in freshwater and have a high calcium content.

===Veterinary and human use===
Zeolites have some veterinary applications, with clinoptilolite approved in the EU as an additive for cattle feed. It acts primarily as a detoxifying agent in the gut, where is can absorb undesirable species via ion-exchange before being excreted. For instance, nitrate fertilisers are water soluble and prolonged exposure by dairy cattle is known to impair protein metabolism and glucose utilization. Clinoptilolite adsorbs nitrate ions with good selectivity, allowing it to reduce these ill effects.

Zeolites have been studied for human medical applications, particularly for bowel conditions. There are no approved medical uses for zeolites as of 2024. Regardless, they are widely marketed as dietary supplements.

== Computational study ==

Computer calculations have predicted that millions of hypothetical zeolite structures are possible. However, only 232 of these structures have been discovered and synthesized so far, so many zeolite scientists question why only this small fraction of possibilities are observed. This problem is often referred to as &quot;the bottleneck problem&quot;. Currently, several theories attempt to explain the reasoning behind this question.

# Zeolite synthesis research has primarily concentrated on hydrothermal methods; however, new zeolites may be synthesized using alternative methods. Synthesis methods that have started to gain use include microwave-assisted, post-synthetic modification, and steam. 
# Geometric computer simulations have shown that the discovered zeolite frameworks possess a behavior known as &quot;the flexibility window&quot;. This shows that there is a range in which the zeolite structure is &quot;flexible&quot; and can be compressed but retains the framework structure. It is suggested that if a framework does not possess this property then it cannot be feasibly synthesized.
# As zeolites are metastable, certain frameworks may be inaccessible as nucleation cannot occur because more stable and energetically favorable zeolites will form. Post-synthetic modification has been used to combat this issue with the ADOR method, whereby frameworks can be cut apart into layers and bonded back together by either removing silica bonds or including them.
# Based on dense crystal model systems, the theory of crystallization via solute pre-nucleation clusters was developed. Investigation of zeolite crystallization in hydrated silicate ionic liquids (HSIL) has shown that zeolites can nucleate via the condensation of ion-paired pre-nucleation clusters. This line of research identified several connections between the synthesis medium liquid chemistry and important properties of zeolite crystals, such as the role of inorganic structure-directing agents in zeolite framework selection, the role of ion-pairing on the zeolite molecular composition and topology, and the role of liquid cation mobility on the zeolite crystal size and morphology. Consequently, complex relations exist between the properties of zeolite synthesis media and the crystallizing zeolite, potentially explaining why only a small fraction of the hypothetical zeolite frameworks can be synthesized. While these relations are not yet fully understood, HSIL zeolite synthesis is an exceptional model system for zeolite science, providing opportunities to advance current understanding of the zeolite conundrum.

<doc id="92390" wikidata="Q7991947" url="?curid=92390" title="Wheaton, Maryland">
<text>Wheaton is a census-designated place in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States, situated north of Washington, D.C., and northwest of downtown Silver Spring. Wheaton takes its name from Frank Wheaton (1833–1903), a career officer in the United States Army and volunteer from Rhode Island in the Union Army who rose to the rank of major-general while serving before, during, and after the Civil War.

Wheaton had a population of 52,150 at the 2020 census. The United States Postal Service has assigned ZIP code 20902 to Wheaton, but the Wheaton Post Office is a part of the larger Silver Spring area. Downtown Wheaton is located around the triangle formed by Veirs Mill Road, University Boulevard, and Georgia Avenue.

==History ==
===Three roads===
Wheaton developed from Leesborough (named in 1826), a small business district that grew near the junction of three major roads. The first of these is Brookeville Pike (also known as the Washington-Brookeville Pike and later as the Union Turnpike, now Georgia Avenue) a north/south toll thoroughfare running from Washington, D.C., to Brookeville and eventually to Baltimore.

The second road, Veirs Mill Road (named after a grist and sawmill built on Rock Creek by Samuel Clark Veirs in 1838), was one portion of a much longer thoroughfare running west to Rockville, Maryland, and thence towards the Potomac River and subsequently to Virginia via ferry crossings. This was also known as the &quot;City Road&quot; in Rockville, and around the time of the Civil War it was known also as the &quot;New Cut Road.&quot;

The last of these roads was known as Old Bladensburg Road (now University Boulevard) which, as it does in present day, connected Georgetown, Bethesda, Chevy Chase, Kensington, Wheaton, Silver Spring, and Bladensburg.

===Mitchell&#x27;s Crossroads===
The business district became known as Mitchell&#x27;s Crossroads, after Robert T. Mitchell&#x27;s tavern, which sat at the northeast corner of Union Turnpike and Old Bladensburg Road.

In 1864, Confederate General Jubal Early led troops through the area on their way to attack Washington, D.C. Union General Frank Wheaton and his division beat them back at the Battle of Fort Stevens.

Mitchell&#x27;s Tavern was destroyed by a fire in 1940.

===After the Civil War===
After the Civil War, the area&#x27;s first postmaster was war veteran George F. Plyer, who in October 1869, renamed the post office in honor of his commanding officer, General Wheaton.

For many years, the Wheaton area was only lightly used, mostly for farming. In 1871, the first African American Church, Allen Chapel AME Church, was established. This religious body maintained its presence in the Wheaton community until 2000, at which time the New Creation Church purchased the property.

Into the early 20th century, civic growth in the area was slow, with a few new businesses established along the major roads. But after World War II, Wheaton quickly expanded. The area&#x27;s first modern post office opened in 1947 (earlier records show that the post office had used the Leesborough name). In addition, the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC) was active, adding utility infrastructure to the area. As part of that work, and just north of Wheaton, the prominent Glenmont Water Tower was constructed in 1947. Wheaton was steadily built-out by several developers (Kay Construction Co. in particular), becoming a part of the modern-day suburbs of Washington, D.C. Today, as an unincorporated town, Wheaton is governed locally by the civic government of Montgomery County. For some modern information databases, such as official real estate records, Wheaton (along with several neighboring locales) is considered to be a sub-section of larger Silver Spring.

== Demographics ==

In the 1950s the area was developed with Cape Cod, ranch houses, and split-level homes purchased by white, largely middle-class, families; a mix of blue-collar and white-collar workers. Now, more of this older housing stock is owned or rented by a diverse population.
As of 2010–2020, Wheaton is 23.8% White, 40.5% Hispanic or Latino, 18.5% African American (4.1% Ethiopian, 1.3% Jamaican), and 13.9% Asian (4.42% Vietnamese, 3.72% Filipino, 1.67% Chinese, 1.59% Indian). 2.4% of the population identified as mixed-race. The largest immigrant groups were from El Salvador, Ethiopia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Honduras.

Between 2000 and 2010, Wheaton&#x27;s Hispanic population has increased from 29% to 42%. Wheaton&#x27;s Hispanic population is highly ethnically diverse - as of the 2010 Census, Wheaton is 18.5% Salvadoran, 3.2% Mexican, 2.8% Guatemalan, 2.3% Peruvian, 2.3% Honduran, 1.3% Dominican, 1.2% Nicaraguan, 1% Bolivian, 0.9% Colombian, 0.8% Puerto Rican, 0.7% Ecuadorians, 0.3% Cuban, 0.3% Chilean, and 0.3% Argentine, all numbering over 100 residents. 16.5% of Wheaton&#x27;s residents were White Hispanics/Latinos, 1% were Afro-Hispanics/Afro-Latinos, 0.6% were American Indian or Alaska Native Hispanics/Latinos, 0.2% were Asian-American Hispanics/Latinos, 3% were Hispanics/Latinos of two or more races, and 20.5% were Hispanics/Latinos from some other race.

In 2020, local prosecutors said in a 28-page indictment that 21 MS-13 Gang members had committed crimes against 18 victims, including 9 in Wheaton. The crimes against Wheaton residents includes murder, attempted murder with a gun, assault and racketeering.

==Features==

Wheaton is home to the Wheaton Regional Park, which includes a nature center; riding stables; dog park; a picnic area with carousel and miniature train; an athletic complex with indoor tennis, ice rink, inline skating rink, and ball fields; and Brookside Gardens, Montgomery County&#x27;s 50-acre (200,000-m²) public display garden. Much of Wheaton was developed in the 1950s. In the 1960s, its shopping center, Wheaton Plaza (now known as Westfield Wheaton), was the largest in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. 
The Wheaton Volunteer Rescue Squad is one of the busiest (11,000 calls in 2007) predominantly volunteer fire departments in Montgomery County.

The diversity of the neighborhood is reflected by the high concentration of various ethnic restaurants located in Wheaton.

It is served by the Red Line of the Washington Metro system. Spanning 508 feet (155 m), the Wheaton station has the longest escalator in the Western Hemisphere.

Since Wheaton has the highest location in the Washington, D.C., area, it was also the home of the first television license in the United States. Using the call sign W3XK, Charles Francis Jenkins began broadcasting from his home at the corner of Windham Lane and Georgia Ave. starting on July 2, 1928.

==Designation as a Maryland Arts and Entertainment District==
Wheaton has been designated by the State of Maryland as an Arts and Entertainment District, joining Silver Spring and Bethesda as the third district in Montgomery County to receive the distinction. The Arts and Entertainment District designation provides artists working in that area with an income tax break. Developers who create spaces for artists to live and work can be exempt from paying certain property taxes on the value of the renovations for up to 10 years. Designated districts are exempt from admissions and amusement taxes.

<text>Streptococcus pyogenes is a species of Gram-positive, aerotolerant bacteria in the genus &quot;Streptococcus&quot;. These bacteria are extracellular, and made up of non-motile and non-sporing cocci (round cells) that tend to link in chains. They are clinically important for humans, as they are an infrequent, but usually pathogenic, part of the skin microbiota that can cause group A streptococcal infection. &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; is the predominant species harboring the Lancefield group A antigen, and is often called group A &quot;Streptococcus (GAS). However, both &quot;[[Streptococcus dysgalactiae]]&quot; and the &quot;[[Streptococcus anginosus]]&quot; group can possess group A antigen as well. Group A streptococci, when grown on [[blood agar]], typically produce small (2–3 mm) zones of [[beta-hemolysis]], a complete [[Lysis|destruction]] of [[red blood cell]]s. The namegroup A (beta-hemolytic) &quot;Streptococcus is thus also used.

The species name is derived from Greek words meaning &#x27;a chain&#x27; () of berries ( [Latinized from ]) and pus ()-forming (&quot;genes&quot;), since a number of infections caused by the bacterium produce pus. The main criterion for differentiation between &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; spp. and &quot;Streptococcus&quot; spp. is the catalase test. Staphylococci are catalase positive whereas streptococci are catalase-negative. &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; can be cultured on fresh blood agar plates. The PYR test allows for the differentiation of &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; from other morphologically similar beta-hemolytic streptococci (including &quot;S. dysgalactiae&quot; subsp. &quot;esquismilis&quot;) as &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; will produce a positive test result.

An estimated 700 million GAS infections occur worldwide each year. While the overall mortality rate for these infections is less than 0.1%, over 650,000 of the cases are severe and invasive, and these cases have a mortality rate of 25%. Early recognition and treatment are critical; diagnostic failure can result in sepsis and death. &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; is clinically and historically significant as the cause of scarlet fever, which results from exposure to the species&#x27; exotoxin.

==Epidemiology==
Unlike most bacterial pathogens, &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; only infects humans. Thus, zoonotic transmission from an animal (or animal products) to a human is rare.

&quot;S. pyogenes&quot; typically colonizes the throat, genital mucosa, rectum, and skin. Of healthy adults, 1% to 5% have throat, vaginal, or rectal carriage, with children being more common carriers. Most frequently, transmission from one person to another occurs due to inhalation of respiratory droplets, produced by sneezing and coughing from an infected person. Skin contact, contact with objects harboring the bacterium, and consumption of contaminated food are possible but uncommon modes of transmission. Streptococcal pharyngitis occurs most frequently in late winter to early spring in most countries as indoor spaces are used more often and thus more crowded. Disease cases are the lowest during autumn.

Maternal &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; infection usually happens in late pregnancy, at more than 30 weeks of gestation to four weeks postpartum. Maternal infections account for 2 to 4% of all clinically diagnosed &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; infections. The risk of sepsis is relatively high compared to other bacterial infections acquired during pregnancy, and &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; is a leading cause of septic shock and death in pregnant and postpartum women.

==Bacteriology==
=== Serotyping ===

In 1928, Rebecca Lancefield published a method for serotyping &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; based on its cell-wall polysaccharide, a virulence factor displayed on its surface. Later, in 1946, Lancefield described the serologic classification of &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; isolates based on components of their surface pili (known as the T-antigen) which are used by bacteria to attach to host cells. As of 2016, a total of 120 M proteins are identified. These M proteins are encoded by 234 types &quot;emm&quot; gene with greater than 1,200 alleles.

=== Lysogeny ===

All strains of &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; are polylysogenized, in that they carry one or more bacteriophage on their genomes. Some of the phages may be defective, but in some cases active phage may compensate for defects in others. In general, the genome of &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; strains isolated during disease are &gt;90% identical, they differ by the phage they carry.

=== Virulence factors ===

&quot;S. pyogenes&quot; has several virulence factors that enable it to attach to host tissues, evade the immune response, and spread by penetrating host tissue layers. A carbohydrate-based bacterial capsule composed of hyaluronic acid surrounds the bacterium, protecting it from phagocytosis by neutrophils. In addition, the capsule and several factors embedded in the cell wall, including M protein, lipoteichoic acid, and protein F (SfbI) facilitate attachment to various host cells. M protein also inhibits opsonization by the alternative complement pathway by binding to host complement regulators. The M protein found on some serotypes is also able to prevent opsonization by binding to fibrinogen. However, the M protein is also the weakest point in this pathogen&#x27;s defense, as antibodies produced by the immune system against M protein target the bacteria for engulfment by phagocytes. M proteins are unique to each strain, and identification can be used clinically to confirm the strain causing an infection.

=== Genome ===
The genomes of different strains were sequenced (genome size is 1.8–1.9 Mbp) encoding about 1700-1900 proteins (1700 in strain NZ131, 1865 in strain MGAS5005). Complete genome sequences of the type strain of &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; (NCTC 8198T = CCUG 4207T) are available in DNA Data Bank of Japan, European Nucleotide Archive, and GenBank under the accession numbers LN831034 and CP028841.

=== Biofilm formation ===
Biofilms are a way for &quot;S. pyogenes,&quot; as well as other bacterial cells, to communicate with each other. In the biofilm gene expression for multiple purposes (such as defending against the host immune system) is controlled via quorum sensing.
One of the biofilm forming pathways in GAS is the Rgg2/3 pathway. It regulates SHP&#x27;s (short hydrophobic peptides) that are quorum sensing pheromones a.k.a. autoinducers. The SHP&#x27;s are translated to an immature form of the pheromone and must undergo processing, first by a metalloprotease enzyme inside the cell and then in the extracellular space, to reach their mature active form. The mode of transportation out of the cell and the extracellular processing factor(s) are still unknown. The mature SHP pheromone can then be taken into nearby cells and the cell it originated from via a transmembrane protein, oligopeptide permease.
In the cytosol the pheromones have two functions in the Rgg2/3 pathway. Firstly, they inhibit the activity of Rgg3 which is a transcriptional regulator repressing SHP production. Secondly, they bind another transcriptional regulator, Rgg2, that increases the production of SHP&#x27;s, having an antagonistic effect to Rgg3. SHP&#x27;s activating their own transcriptional activator creates a positive feedback loop, which is common for the production for quorum sensing peptides. It enables the rapid production of the pheromones in large quantities. The production of SHP&#x27;s increases biofilm biogenesis.
It has been suggested that GAS switches between biofilm formation and degradation by utilizing pathways with opposing effects. Whilst Rgg2/3 pathway increases biofilm, the RopB pathway disrupts it. RopB is another Rgg-like protein (Rgg1) that directly activates SpeB (Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B), a cysteine protease that acts as a virulence factor. In the absence of this pathway, biofilm formation is enhanced, possibly due to the lack of the protease degrading pheromones or other Rgg2/3 pathway counteracting effects.

== Disease ==
&quot;S. pyogenes&quot; is the cause of many human diseases, ranging from mild superficial skin infections to life-threatening systemic diseases. The most frequent manifestations of disease are commonly known as scarlet fever. Infections typically begin in the throat or skin. The most striking sign is a strawberry-like rash. Examples of mild &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; infections include pharyngitis (strep throat) and localized skin infection (impetigo). Erysipelas and cellulitis are characterized by multiplication and lateral spread of &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; in deep layers of the skin. &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; invasion and multiplication in the fascia beneath the skin can lead to necrotizing fasciitis, a life-threatening surgical emergency. The bacterium is also an important cause of infection in newborns, who are susceptible to some forms of the infection that are rarely seen in adults, including meningitis.

Like many pathogenic bacteria, &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; may colonize a healthy person&#x27;s respiratory system without causing disease, existing as a commensal member of the respiratory microbiota. It is commonly found in some populations as part of the mixed microbiome of the upper respiratory tract. Individuals who have the bacterium in their bodies but no signs of disease are known as asymptomatic carriers. The bacteria may start to cause disease when the host&#x27;s immune system weakens, such as during a viral respiratory infection, which may lead to &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; superinfection.

&quot;S. pyogenes&quot; infections are commonly associated with the release of one or more bacterial toxins. The release of endotoxins from throat infections has been linked to the development of scarlet fever. Other toxins produced by &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; may lead to streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, a life-threatening emergency.

&quot;S. pyogenes&quot; can also cause disease in the form of post-infectious &quot;non-pyogenic&quot; (not associated with local bacterial multiplication and pus formation) syndromes. These autoimmune-mediated complications follow a small percentage of infections and include rheumatic fever and acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis. Both conditions appear several weeks following the initial streptococcal infection. Rheumatic fever is characterized by inflammation of the joints and/or heart following an episode of streptococcal pharyngitis. Acute glomerulonephritis, inflammation of the renal glomerulus, can follow streptococcal pharyngitis or skin infection.

&quot;S. pyogenes&quot; is sensitive to penicillin, and has not developed resistance to it, making penicillin a suitable antibiotic to treat infections caused by this bacterium. Failure of treatment with penicillin is generally attributed to other local commensal microorganisms producing β-lactamase, or failure to achieve adequate tissue levels in the pharynx. Certain strains have developed resistance to macrolides, tetracyclines, and clindamycin.

== Vaccine ==
There is a polyvalent inactivated vaccine against several types of &quot;Streptococcus&quot; including S. pyogenes called &quot; vacuna antipiogena polivalente BIOL&quot; it is recommended an administration in a series of 5 weeks. Two weekly applications are made at intervals of 2 to 4 days. The vaccine is produced by the Instituto Biológico Argentino.

There is another potential vaccine being developed; the vaccine candidate peptide is called StreptInCor.

== Applications ==
=== Bionanotechnology ===
Many &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; proteins have unique properties, which have been harnessed in recent years to produce a highly specific &quot;superglue&quot; and a route to enhance the effectiveness of antibody therapy.

=== Genome editing ===
The CRISPR system from this organism that is used to recognize and destroy DNA from invading viruses, thus stopping the infection, was appropriated in 2012 for use as a genome-editing tool that could potentially alter any piece of DNA and later RNA.

<doc id="92396" wikidata="Q180266" url="?curid=92396" title="Scarlet fever">
<text>Scarlet fever, also known as scarlatina, is an infectious disease caused by &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, a Group A streptococcus (GAS). It most commonly affects children between five and 15 years of age. The signs and symptoms include a sore throat, fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and a characteristic rash. The face is flushed and the rash is red and blanching. It typically feels like sandpaper and the tongue may be red and bumpy. The rash occurs as a result of capillary damage by exotoxins produced by &quot;S.pyogenes&quot;. On darker-pigmented skin the rash may be hard to discern.
Scarlet fever develops in a small number of people who have strep throat or streptococcal skin infections. The bacteria are usually spread by people coughing or sneezing. It can also be spread when a person touches an object that has the bacteria on it and then touches their mouth or nose. The diagnosis is typically confirmed by culturing swabs of the throat.
There is no vaccine for scarlet fever. Prevention is by frequent handwashing, not sharing personal items, and staying away from other people when sick. The disease is treatable with antibiotics, which reduce symptoms and spread, and prevent most complications. Outcomes with scarlet fever are typically good if treated. Long-term complications as a result of scarlet fever include kidney disease, rheumatic fever, and arthritis. 
In the early 20th century, scarlet fever was a leading cause of death in children, but even before World War II and the introduction of antibiotics, its severity was already declining. This decline is suggested to be due to better living conditions, the introduction of better control measures, or a decline in the virulence of the bacteria. In recent years, there have been signs of antibiotic resistance; there was an outbreak in Hong Kong in 2011 and in the UK in 2014, and occurrence of the disease rose by 68% in the UK between 2014 and 2018. Research published in October 2020 showed that infection of the bacterium by three viruses has led to more virulent strains of the bacterium.

==Signs and symptoms==
Scarlet fever typically presents with a sudden onset of sore throat, fever, and malaise. Headache, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain may also be present. Scarlet fever usually follows from a group A streptococcal infection that involves a &quot;strep throat&quot;, such as streptococcal tonsillitis or more usually streptococcal pharyngitis. Often these can present together, known as &quot;pharyngotonsillitis&quot;. The signs and symptoms are therefore those of a &quot;strep throat&quot; but these are followed by the inclusion of the characteristic widespread rash. The rash usually appears one to two days later, but may appear before or up to seven days following feeling ill. 

It generally hurts to swallow. However, not all cases present with a fever, the degree of tiredness may vary, the sore throat and tongue changes might be slight or absent, and in some the rash can be patchy rather than diffuse. Cough, hoarseness, runny nose, diarrhea, and conjunctivitis are typically absent in scarlet fever; such symptoms indicate what is more likely a viral infection.

===Mouth and throat===

Strep throat is usually associated with fatigue and a fever of over 39 °C (102.2 °F). The tonsils may appear red and enlarged and are typically covered in exudate. The throat may be red with small red spots on the roof of the mouth. The uvula can look red and swollen. 30% to 60% of cases have associated enlarged and tender lymph nodes in the neck. During the first two days of illness the tongue may have a whitish coating from which red swollen papillae protrude, giving the appearance of a &quot;white strawberry tongue&quot;. After four to five days when the white coating sheds it becomes a &quot;red strawberry tongue&quot;. The symptomatic appearance of the tongue is part of the rash that is characteristic of scarlet fever.

===Rash===

The characteristic rash has been denoted as &quot;scarlatiniform&quot;, and it appears as a diffuse redness of the skin with small bumps resembling goose bumps. It typically appears as small flat spots on the neck or torso before developing into small bumps that spread to the arms and legs. It tends to feel rough like sandpaper. The cheeks might look flushed with a pale area around the mouth. The scarlet fever rash generally looks red on white and pale skin, and might be difficult to visualise on brown or black skin, in whom the bumps are typically larger, the skin less like sandpaper, and the perioral pallor less obvious. The palms and soles are spared. The reddened skin blanches when pressure is applied to it. The skin may feel itchy, but is not painful. A more intense redness on the inside of skin folds and creases might be noticed. These are lines of petechiae, appearing as pink/red areas located in arm pits and elbow pits. It takes around a week for the main rash to disappear. This may be followed by several weeks of peeling of the skin of typically fingers and toes. The desquamation process usually begins on the face and progresses downward on the body. Sometimes, this peeling is the only sign that scarlet fever occurred. If the case of scarlet fever is uncomplicated, recovery from the fever and clinical symptoms, other than the process of desquamation, occurs in 5–10 days. After the desquamation, the skin will be left with a sunburned appearance.

===Variable presentations===
Children younger than five years old may have atypical presentations and many of the common signs and symptoms may be missing or different. Children younger than 3 years old can present with nasal congestion and a lower grade fever. Infants may present with symptoms of increased irritability and decreased appetite.

===Complications===
The complications, which can arise from scarlet fever when left untreated or inadequately treated, can be divided into two categories: suppurative and nonsuppurative.

Suppurative complications: These are rare complications that arise either from direct spread to structures that are close to the primary site of infection, or spread through the lymphatic system or blood. In the first case, scarlet fever may spread to the pharynx. Possible problems from this method of spread include peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscesses, cellulitis, mastoiditis, or sinusitis.

In the second case, the streptococcal infection may spread through the lymphatic system or the blood to areas of the body further away from the pharynx. A few examples of the many complications that can arise from those methods of spread include endocarditis, pneumonia, or meningitis.

Nonsuppurative complications: These complications arise from certain subtypes of group A streptococci that cause an autoimmune response in the body through what has been termed molecular mimicry. In these cases, the antibodies which the person&#x27;s immune system developed to attack the group A streptococci are also able to attack the person&#x27;s own tissues. The following complications result, depending on which tissues in the person&#x27;s body are targeted by those antibodies.
* Acute rheumatic fever: This is a complication that results 2–6 weeks after a group A streptococcal infection of the upper respiratory tract. It presents in developing countries, where antibiotic treatment of streptococcal infections is less common, as a febrile illness with several clinical manifestations, which are organized into what is called the Jones criteria. These criteria include arthritis, carditis, neurological issues, and skin findings. Diagnosis also depends on evidence of a prior group A streptococcal infection in the upper respiratory tract (as seen in streptococcal pharyngitis and scarlet fever). The carditis is the result of the immunologic response targeting the person&#x27;s heart tissue, and it is the most serious sequela that develops from acute rheumatic fever. When this involvement of the heart tissue occurs, it is called rheumatic heart disease. In most cases of rheumatic heart disease, the mitral valve is affected, ultimately leading to mitral stenosis. The link to rheumatic fever and heart disease is a particular concern in Australia, because of the high prevalence of these diseases in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.
* Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis: This is inflammation of the kidney, which presents 1–2 weeks after a group A streptococcal pharyngitis. It can also develop after an episode of Impetigo or any group A streptococcal infection in the skin (this differs from acute rheumatic fever which only follows group A streptococcal pharyngitis). It is the result of the autoimmune response to the streptococcal infection affecting part of the kidney. Persons present with what is called acute nephritic syndrome, in which they have high blood pressure, swelling, and urinary abnormalities. Urinary abnormalities include blood and protein found in the urine, as well as less urine production overall.
* Poststreptococcal reactive arthritis: The presentation of arthritis after a recent episode of group A streptococcal pharyngitis raises suspicion for acute rheumatic fever, since it is one of the Jones criteria for that separate complication. But, when the arthritis is an isolated symptom, it is referred to as poststreptococcal reactive arthritis. This arthritis can involve a variety of joints throughout the body, unlike the arthritis of acute rheumatic fever, which primarily affects larger joints such as the knee joints. It can present less than 10 days after the group A streptococcal pharyngitis.

==Cause==
Strep throat spreads by close contact among people, via respiratory droplets (for example, saliva or nasal discharge). A person in close contact with another person infected with group A streptococcal pharyngitis has a 35% chance of becoming infected. One in ten children who are infected with group A streptococcal pharyngitis will develop scarlet fever.

==Pathophysiology==
The rash of scarlet fever, which is what differentiates this disease from an isolated group A strep pharyngitis (or strep throat), is caused by specific strains of group A streptococcus that produce a streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin, which is mainly responsible for the skin manifestation of the infection. These toxin-producing strains cause scarlet fever in people who do not already have antitoxin antibodies. Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins – SPEs A, B, C. and F have been identified. The pyrogenic exotoxins, also called &quot;erythrogenic toxins&quot;, cause the erythematous rash of scarlet fever. The strains of group A streptococcus that cause scarlet fever need specific bacteriophages for there to be pyrogenic exotoxin production. Specifically, bacteriophage T12 is responsible for the production of speA. Streptococcal Pyrogenic Exotoxin A, speA, is the one most commonly associated with cases of scarlet fever that are complicated by the immune-mediated sequelae of acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.

These toxins are also known as &quot;superantigens&quot; because they can cause an extensive immune response by activating some of the cells that are mainly responsible for the person&#x27;s immune system. Although the body responds to the toxins it encounters by making antibodies, those antibodies will only protect against that particular subset of toxins. They will not necessarily completely protect a person from future group A streptococcal infections, because there are 12 different pyrogenic exotoxins that may be produced by the disease, and future infections may produce a different subset of those toxins.

===Microbiology===
The disease is caused by secretion of pyrogenic exotoxins by the infecting &quot;Streptococcus&quot; bacteria. Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (&quot;speA&quot;) is probably the best studied of these toxins. It is carried by the bacteriophage T12 which integrates into the streptococcal genome from where the toxin is transcribed. The phage itself integrates into a serine tRNA gene on the chromosome.

The T12 virus itself has not been placed into a taxon by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. It has a double-stranded DNA genome and on morphological grounds appears to be a member of the &quot;Siphoviridae.&quot;

The &quot;speA&quot; gene was cloned and sequenced in 1986. It is 753 base pairs in length and encodes a 29.244 kilodalton (kDa) protein. The protein contains a putative 30-amino-acid signal peptide; removal of the signal sequence gives a predicted molecular weight of 25.787 kDa for the secreted protein. Both a promoter and a ribosome binding site (Shine-Dalgarno sequence) are present upstream of the gene. A transcriptional terminator is located 69 bases downstream from the translational termination codon. The carboxy terminal portion of the protein exhibits extensive homology with the carboxy terminus of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; enterotoxins B and C1.

Streptococcal phages other than T12 may also carry the &quot;speA&quot; gene.

==Diagnosis==
Although the presentation of scarlet fever can be clinically diagnosed, further testing may be required to distinguish it from other illnesses. Also, history of a recent exposure to someone with strep throat can be useful in diagnosis. There are two methods used to confirm suspicion of scarlet fever; rapid antigen detection test and throat culture.

The rapid antigen detection test is a very specific test but not very sensitive. This means that if the result is positive (indicating that the group A strep antigen was detected and therefore confirming that the person has a group A strep pharyngitis), then it is appropriate to treat the people with scarlet fever with antibiotics. But, if the rapid antigen detection test is negative (indicating that they do not have group A strep pharyngitis), then a throat culture is required to confirm, as the first test could have yielded a false negative result. In the early 21st century, the throat culture is the current &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosis.

Serologic testing seeks evidence of the antibodies that the body produces against the streptococcal infection, including antistreptolysin-O and antideoxyribonuclease B. It takes the body 2–3 weeks to make these antibodies, so this type of testing is not useful for diagnosing a current infection. But it is useful when assessing a person who may have one of the complications from a previous streptococcal infection.

Throat cultures done after antibiotic therapy can show if the infection has been removed. These throat swabs, however, are not indicated, because up to 25% of properly treated individuals can continue to carry the streptococcal infection while being asymptomatic.

===Differential diagnosis===
Scarlet fever might appear similar to Kawasaki disease, which has a characteristic red but not white strawberry tongue, and staphylococcal scarlatina which does not have the strawberry tongue at all. Other conditions that might appear similar include impetigo, erysipelas, measles, chickenpox, and hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and may be distinguished by the pattern of symptoms.

* Viral exanthem: Viral infections are often accompanied by a rash which can be described as morbilliform or maculopapular. This type of rash is accompanied by a prodromal period of cough and runny nose in addition to a fever, indicative of a viral process.
* Allergic or contact dermatitis: The erythematous appearance of the skin will be in a more localized distribution rather than the diffuse and generalized rash seen in scarlet fever.
* Drug eruption: These are potential side effects of taking certain drugs such as penicillin. The reddened maculopapular rash which results can be itchy and be accompanied by a fever.
* Kawasaki disease: Children with this disease also present with a strawberry tongue and undergo a desquamative process on their palms and soles. However, these children tend to be younger than five years old, their fever lasts longer (at least five days), and they have additional clinical criteria (including signs such as conjunctival redness and cracked lips), which can help distinguish this from scarlet fever.
* Toxic shock syndrome: Both streptococcal and staphylococcal bacteria can cause this syndrome. Clinical manifestations include diffuse rash and desquamation of the palms and soles. It can be distinguished from scarlet fever by low blood pressure, lack of sandpaper texture for the rash, and multi-organ system involvement.
* Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome: This is a disease that occurs primarily in young children due to a toxin-producing strain of the bacteria &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. The abrupt start of the fever and diffused sunburned appearance of the rash can resemble scarlet fever. However, this rash is associated with tenderness and large blister formation. These blisters easily pop, followed by causing the skin to peel.
* Staphylococcal scarlet fever: The rash is identical to the streptococcal scarlet fever in distribution and texture, but the skin affected by the rash will be tender.

==Prevention==
One method is long-term use of antibiotics to prevent future group A streptococcal infections. This method is only indicated for people who have had complications like recurrent attacks of acute rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease. Antibiotics are limited in their ability to prevent these infections since there are a variety of subtypes of group A streptococci that can cause the infection.

Although there are currently no vaccines available, the vaccine approach has a greater likelihood of effectively preventing group A streptococcal infections in the future because vaccine formulations can target multiple subtypes of the bacteria. A vaccine developed by George and Gladys Dick in 1924 was discontinued due to poor efficacy and the introduction of antibiotics. Difficulties in vaccine development include the considerable strain variety of group A streptococci present in the environment and the amount of time and number of people needed for appropriate trials for safety and efficacy of any potential vaccine. There have been several attempts to create a vaccine in the past few decades. These vaccines, which are still in the development phase, expose the person to proteins present on the surface of the group A streptococci to activate an immune response that will prepare the person to fight and prevent future infections.

There used to be a diphtheria scarlet fever vaccine. It was, however, found not to be effective. This product was discontinued by the end of World War II.

==Treatment==
Antibiotics to combat the streptococcal infection are the mainstay of treatment for scarlet fever. Prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics decreases the length of illness. Peeling of the outer layer of skin, however, will happen despite treatment. One of the main goals of treatment is to prevent the child from developing one of the suppurative or nonsuppurative complications, especially acute rheumatic fever. As long as antibiotics are started within nine days, it is very unlikely for the child to develop acute rheumatic fever. Antibiotic therapy has not been shown to prevent the development of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Another important reason for prompt treatment with antibiotics is the ability to prevent transmission of the infection between children. An infected individual is most likely to pass on the infection to another person during the first two weeks. A child is no longer contagious (able to pass the infection to another child) after 24 hours of antibiotics.

The antibiotic of choice is Penicillin V which is taken by mouth. In countries without a liquid Penicillin V product, children unable to take tablets can be given amoxicillin which comes in a liquid form and is equally effective. Duration of treatment is 10 days. Benzathine penicillin G can be given as a one time intramuscular injection as another alternative if swallowing pills is not possible. If the person is allergic to the family of antibiotics which both penicillin and amoxicillin are a part of (beta-lactam antibiotics), a first generation cephalosporin is used. Cephalosporin antibiotics, however, can still cause adverse reactions in people whose allergic reaction to penicillin is a Type 1 Hypersensitivity reaction. In those cases it is appropriate to choose clindamycin or erythromycin instead. Tonsillectomy, although once a reasonable treatment for recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, is not indicated, as a person can still be infected with group A streptococcus without their tonsils.

===Antibiotic resistance and resurgence===
A drug-resistant strain of scarlet fever, resistant to macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin, but retaining drug-sensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, emerged in Hong Kong in 2011, accounting for at least two deaths in that city—the first such in over a decade. About 60% of circulating strains of the group A streptococcus that cause scarlet fever in Hong Kong are resistant to macrolide antibiotics, according to Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, head of Hong Kong University&#x27;s microbiology department. Previously, observed resistance rates had been 10–30%; the increase is likely the result of overuse of macrolide antibiotics in recent years.

There was also an outbreak in the UK in 2014, and the National Health Service reported a 68% increase in the number of &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; identified in laboratory reports between 2014 and 2018.

New research published in October 2020 indicates that the bacterium appears to be getting more robust after being infected with viruses, specifically the North-East Asian serotype M12 (emm12) (group A Streptococcus, GAS). They found three new genes, acquired from viruses, which cause development of &quot;superantigens&quot; targeting white blood cells, resulting in a more virulent strain of the bacterium.

A vaccine that will protect against the 180 to 200 types of bacteria causing the disease has been worked on for over 20 years, but a safe one had not yet been developed.

==Epidemiology==
Scarlet fever occurs equally in both males and females. Children are most commonly infected, typically between 5–15 years old. Although streptococcal infections can happen at any time of year, infection rates peak in the winter and spring months, typically in colder climates.

The morbidity and mortality of scarlet fever has declined since the 18th and 19th centuries when there were epidemics of this disease. Around 1900 the mortality rate in multiple places reached 25%. The improvement in prognosis can be attributed to the use of penicillin in the treatment of this disease. The frequency of scarlet fever cases has also been declining over the past century. 

There have been several reported outbreaks of the disease in various countries in the past decade. The reason for these increases remains unclear in the medical community. Between 2013 and 2016 population rates of scarlet fever in England increased from 8.2 to 33.2 per 100,000 and hospital admissions for scarlet fever increased by 97%. Further increases in the reporting of scarlet fever cases have been noted in England during the 2021–2022 season (September to September) and so far also in the season 2022–2023. The World Health Organization has reported an increase in scarlet fever (and iGAS – invasive GAS cases) in England, and other European countries during this time. Increases have been reported in France and Ireland. In the US, cases of scarlet fever are not reported, but as of December 2022, the CDC was looking at a possible increase in the numbers of invasive GAS infections reported in children. In late December 2022, the CDC&#x27;s Health Alert Network issued an advisory on the reported increases in invasive GAS infections.

==History==
It is unclear when a description of this disease was first recorded. Hippocrates, writing around 400 BC, described the condition of a person with a reddened skin and fever.

The first unambiguous description of the disease in the medical literature appeared in the 1553 book &quot;De Tumoribus praeter Naturam&quot; by the Sicilian anatomist and physician Giovanni Filippo Ingrassia, where he referred to it as &quot;rossalia&quot;. He also made a point to distinguish that this presentation had different characteristics from measles. It was redescribed by Johann Weyer during an epidemic in lower Germany between 1564 and 1565; he referred to it as &quot;scarlatina anginosa&quot;. The first unequivocal description of scarlet fever appeared in a book by Joannes Coyttarus of Poitiers, , which was published in 1578 in Paris. Daniel Sennert of Wittenberg described the classical &#x27;scarlatinal desquamation&#x27; in 1572 and was also the first to describe the early arthritis, scarlatinal dropsy, and ascites associated with the disease.

In 1675 the term that has been commonly used to refer to scarlet fever, &quot;scarlatina&quot;, was written by Thomas Sydenham, an English physician.
In 1827, Richard Bright was the first to recognize the involvement of the renal system in scarlet fever.

The association between streptococci and disease was first described in 1874 by Theodor Billroth, discussing people with skin infections. Billroth also coined the genus name &quot;Streptococcus&quot;. In 1884 Friedrich Julius Rosenbach edited the name to its current one, &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes,&quot; after further looking at the bacteria in the skin lesions. The organism was first cultured in 1883 by the German surgeon Friedrich Fehleisen from erysipelas lesions.

Also in 1884, the German physician Friedrich Loeffler was the first to show the presence of streptococci in the throats of people with scarlet fever. Because not all people with pharyngeal streptococci developed scarlet fever, these findings remained controversial for some time. The association between streptococci and scarlet fever was confirmed by Alphonse Dochez and George and Gladys Dick in the early 1900s.

Also in 1884, the world&#x27;s first convalescent home for people with scarlet fever was opened at Brockley Hill, Stanmore, founded by Mary Wardell.

Nil Filatov (in 1895) and Clement Dukes (in 1894) described an exanthematous disease which they thought was a form of rubella, but in 1900, Dukes described it as a separate illness which came to be known as Dukes&#x27; disease, Filatov&#x27;s disease, or fourth disease. However, in 1979, Keith Powell identified it as in fact the same illness as the form of scarlet fever which is caused by staphylococcal exotoxin and is known as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome.

Scarlet fever serum from horses&#x27; blood was used in the treatment of children beginning in 1900 and reduced mortality rates significantly.

In 1906, Austrian pediatrician Clemens von Pirquet postulated that disease-causing immune complexes were responsible for the nephritis that followed scarlet fever.

Bacteriophages were discovered in 1915 by Frederick Twort. His work was overlooked and bacteriophages were later rediscovered by Felix d&#x27;Herelle in 1917. The specific association of scarlet fever with the group A streptococci had to await the development of Rebecca Lancefield&#x27;s streptococcal grouping scheme in the 1920s. George and Gladys Dick showed that cell-free filtrates could induce the erythematous reaction characteristic of scarlet fever, proving that this reaction was due to a toxin. Karelitz and Stempien discovered that extracts from human serum globulin and placental globulin can be used as lightening agents for scarlet fever and this was used later as the basis for the Dick test. The association of scarlet fever and bacteriophages was described in 1926 by Cantacuzène (Ioan Cantacuzino) and Bonciu.

There was a widespread epidemic of scarlet fever in 1922. Amongst the victims of this epidemic was Agathe Whitehead.

An antitoxin for scarlet fever was developed in 1924. The discovery of penicillin and its subsequent widespread use significantly reduced the mortality of this once-feared disease. The first toxin which causes this disease was cloned and sequenced in 1986 by Weeks and Ferretti.

The incidence of scarlet fever was reported to be increasing in countries including England, Wales, South Korea, Vietnam, China, and Hong Kong in the 2010s; the cause had not been established as of 2018. Cases were also reported to be increasing after the easing of restrictions due to the COVID pandemic that started in 2020.

=== The Dick test ===
The Dick test, developed in 1924 by George F. Dick and Gladys Dick, was used to identify those susceptible to scarlet fever. The Dick test involved injecting a diluted strain of the streptococci known to cause scarlet fever; a reaction in the skin at the injection site identified people susceptible to developing scarlet fever. The reaction could be seen four hours after the injection, but was more noticeable after 24 hours. If no reaction was seen in the skin, then the person was assumed not to be at risk from the disease, having developed immunity to it.

<text>Streptococcal pharyngitis, also known as streptococcal sore throat (strep throat), is pharyngitis (an infection of the pharynx, the back of the throat) caused by &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, a gram-positive, group A streptococcus. Common symptoms include fever, sore throat, red tonsils, and enlarged lymph nodes in the front of the neck. A headache and nausea or vomiting may also occur. Some develop a sandpaper-like rash which is known as scarlet fever. Symptoms typically begin one to three days after exposure and last seven to ten days.
Strep throat is spread by respiratory droplets from an infected person, spread by talking, coughing or sneezing, or by touching something that has droplets on it and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. It may be spread directly through touching infected sores. It may also be spread by contact with skin infected with group A strep. The diagnosis is made based on the results of a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture. Some people may carry the bacteria without symptoms.
Prevention is by frequent hand washing, and not sharing eating utensils. There is no vaccine for the disease. Treatment with antibiotics is only recommended in those with a confirmed diagnosis. Those infected should stay away from other people until fever is gone and for at least 12 hours after starting treatment. Pain can be treated with paracetamol (acetaminophen) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen.
Strep throat is a common bacterial infection in children. It is the cause of 15–40% of sore throats among children and 5–15% among adults. Cases are more common in late winter and early spring. Potential complications include rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess.

==Signs and symptoms==
The typical signs and symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis are a sore throat, fever of greater than , tonsillar exudates (pus on the tonsils), and large cervical lymph nodes.

Other symptoms include: headache, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, muscle pain, or a scarlatiniform rash or palatal petechiae, the latter being an uncommon but highly specific finding.

Symptoms typically begin one to three days after exposure and last seven to ten days.

Strep throat is unlikely when any of the symptoms of red eyes, hoarseness, runny nose, or mouth ulcers are present. It is also unlikely when there is no fever.

==Cause==
Strep throat is caused by group A β-hemolytic &quot;Streptococcus&quot; (GAS or &quot;S. pyogenes&quot;). Humans are the primary natural reservoir for group A streptococcus. Other bacteria such as non–group A β-hemolytic &quot;streptococci&quot; and &quot;fusobacterium&quot; may also cause pharyngitis. It is spread by direct, close contact with an infected person; thus crowding, as may be found in the military and schools, increases the rate of transmission. Dried bacteria in dust are not infectious, although moist bacteria on toothbrushes or similar items can persist for up to fifteen days. Contaminated food can result in outbreaks, but this is rare. Of children with no signs or symptoms, 12% carry GAS in their pharynx, and, after treatment, approximately 15% of those remain positive, and are true &quot;carriers&quot;.

==Diagnosis==
A number of scoring systems exist to help with diagnosis; however, their use is controversial due to insufficient accuracy. The modified Centor criteria are a set of five criteria; the total score indicates the probability of a streptococcal infection.

One point is given for each of the criteria:
*Absence of a cough
*Swollen and tender cervical lymph nodes
*Temperature &gt;
*Tonsillar exudate or swelling
*Age less than 15 (a point is subtracted if age &gt;44)

A score of one may indicate no treatment or culture is needed or it may indicate the need to perform further testing if other high risk factors exist, such as a family member having the disease.

The Infectious Disease Society of America recommends against routine antibiotic treatment and considers antibiotics only appropriate when given after a positive test. Testing is not needed in children under three as both group A strep and rheumatic fever are rare, unless a child has a sibling with the disease.

===Laboratory testing===
A throat culture is the gold standard for the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis, with a sensitivity of 90–95%. A rapid strep test (also called rapid antigen detection testing or RADT) may also be used. While the rapid strep test is quicker, it has a lower sensitivity (70%) and statistically equal specificity (98%) as a throat culture. In areas of the world where rheumatic fever is uncommon, a negative rapid strep test is sufficient to rule out the disease.

A positive throat culture or RADT in association with symptoms establishes a positive diagnosis in those in which the diagnosis is in doubt. In adults, a negative RADT is sufficient to rule out the diagnosis. However, in children a throat culture is recommended to confirm the result. Asymptomatic individuals should not be routinely tested with a throat culture or RADT because a certain percentage of the population persistently &quot;carries&quot; the streptococcal bacteria in their throat without any harmful results.

===Differential diagnosis===

As the symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis overlap with other conditions, it can be difficult to make the diagnosis clinically. Coughing, nasal discharge, diarrhea, and red, irritated eyes in addition to fever and sore throat are more indicative of a viral sore throat than of strep throat. The presence of marked lymph node enlargement along with sore throat, fever, and tonsillar enlargement may also occur in infectious mononucleosis. Other conditions that may present similarly include epiglottitis, Kawasaki disease, acute retroviral syndrome, Lemierre&#x27;s syndrome, Ludwig&#x27;s angina, peritonsillar abscess, and retropharyngeal abscess.

==Prevention==
Tonsillectomy may be a reasonable preventive measure in those with frequent throat infections (more than three a year). However, the benefits are small and episodes typically lessen in time regardless of measures taken. Recurrent episodes of pharyngitis which test positive for GAS may also represent a person who is a chronic carrier of GAS who is getting recurrent viral infections. Treating people who have been exposed but who are without symptoms is not recommended. Treating people who are carriers of GAS is not recommended as the risk of spread and complications is low.

==Treatment==
Untreated streptococcal pharyngitis usually resolves within a few days. Treatment with antibiotics shortens the duration of the acute illness by about 16 hours. The primary reason for treatment with antibiotics is to reduce the risk of complications such as rheumatic fever and retropharyngeal abscesses. Antibiotics prevent acute rheumatic fever if given within 9 days of the onset of symptoms.

===Pain medication===
Pain medication such as NSAIDs and paracetamol (acetaminophen) helps in the management of pain associated with strep throat. Viscous lidocaine may also be useful. While steroids may help with the pain, they are not routinely recommended. Aspirin may be used in adults but is not recommended in children due to the risk of Reye syndrome.

===Antibiotics===
The antibiotic of choice in the United States for streptococcal pharyngitis is penicillin V, due to safety, cost, and effectiveness. Amoxicillin is preferred in Europe. In India, where the risk of rheumatic fever is higher, intramuscular benzathine penicillin G is the first choice for treatment.

Appropriate antibiotics decrease the average 3–5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness. They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess. The arguments in favor of antibiotic treatment should be balanced by the consideration of possible side effects, and it is reasonable to suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication or those at low risk of complications. Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a higher rate than would be expected from how common it is.

Erythromycin and other macrolides or clindamycin are recommended for people with severe penicillin allergies. First-generation cephalosporins may be used in those with less severe allergies and some low-certainty evidence suggest cephalosporins are superior to penicillin. These late-generation antibiotics show a similar effect when prescribed for 3–7 days in comparison to the standard ten days of penicillin when used in areas of low rheumatic heart disease. Streptococcal infections may also lead to acute glomerulonephritis; however, the incidence of this side effect is not reduced by the use of antibiotics.

==Prognosis==
The symptoms of strep throat usually improve within three to five days, irrespective of treatment. Treatment with antibiotics reduces the risk of complications and transmission; children may return to school 24 hours after antibiotics are administered. The risk of complications in adults is low. In children, acute rheumatic fever is rare in most of the developed world. It is, however, the leading cause of acquired heart disease in India, sub-Saharan Africa, and some parts of Australia.

==Complications==
Complications arising from streptococcal throat infections include:
* Acute rheumatic fever
* Scarlet fever
* Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome
* Glomerulonephritis
* PANDAS syndrome 
* Peritonsillar abscess 
*Cervical lymphadenitis 
*Mastoiditis 
The economic cost of the disease in the United States in children is approximately $350 million annually.

==Epidemiology==
Pharyngitis, the broader category into which Streptococcal pharyngitis falls, is diagnosed in 11 million people annually in the United States. It is the cause of 15–40% of sore throats among children and 5–15% in adults. Cases usually occur in late winter and early spring.

<doc id="92399" wikidata="Q28971" url="?curid=92399" title="Impetigo">
<text>Impetigo is a contagious bacterial infection that involves the superficial skin. The most common presentation is yellowish crusts on the face, arms, or legs. Less commonly there may be large blisters which affect the groin or armpits. The lesions may be painful or itchy. Fever is uncommon.
It is typically due to either &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; or &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;. Risk factors include attending day care, crowding, poor nutrition, diabetes mellitus, contact sports, and breaks in the skin such as from mosquito bites, eczema, scabies, or herpes. With contact it can spread around or between people. Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and appearance.
Prevention is by hand washing, avoiding people who are infected, and cleaning injuries. Treatment is typically with antibiotic creams such as mupirocin or fusidic acid. Antibiotics by mouth, such as cefalexin, may be used if large areas are affected. Antibiotic-resistant forms have been found. Healing generally occurs without scarring.
Impetigo affected about 140 million people (2% of the world population) in 2010. It can occur at any age, but is most common in young children aged two to five. In some places the condition is also known as &quot;school sores&quot;. Without treatment people typically get better within three weeks. Recurring infections can occur due to colonization of the nose by the bacteria. Complications may include cellulitis or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. The name is from the Latin meaning &quot;attack&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==

===Contagious impetigo===
This most common form of impetigo, also called nonbullous impetigo, most often begins as a red sore near the nose or mouth which soon breaks, leaking pus or fluid, and forms a honey-colored scab, followed by a red mark which often heals without leaving a scar. Sores are not painful, but they may be itchy. Lymph nodes in the affected area may be swollen, but fever is rare. Touching or scratching the sores may easily spread the infection to other parts of the body.

Skin ulcers with redness and scarring also may result from scratching or abrading the skin.

===Bullous impetigo===

Bullous impetigo, mainly seen in children younger than two years, involves painless, fluid-filled blisters, mostly on the arms, legs, and trunk, surrounded by red and itchy (but not sore) skin. The blisters may be large or small. After they break, they form yellow scabs.

===Ecthyma===
Ecthyma, the nonbullous form of impetigo, produces painful fluid- or pus-filled sores with redness of skin, usually on the arms and legs, become ulcers that penetrate deeper into the dermis. After they break open, they form hard, thick, gray-yellow scabs, which sometimes leave scars. Ecthyma may be accompanied by swollen lymph nodes in the affected area.

==Causes==
Impetigo is primarily caused by &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and sometimes by &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;. Both bullous and nonbullous are primarily caused by &quot;S. aureus&quot;, with &quot;Streptococcus &quot;also commonly being involved in the nonbullous form.

===Predisposing factors===
Impetigo is more likely to infect children ages 2–5, especially those that attend school or day care. 70% of cases are the nonbullous form and 30% are the bullous form. Impetigo occurs more frequently among people who live in warm climates.

===Transmission===
The infection is spread by direct contact with lesions or with nasal carriers. The incubation period is 1–3 days after exposure to &quot;Streptococcus&quot; and 4–10 days for &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;. Dried streptococci in the air are not infectious to intact skin. Scratching may spread the lesions.

==Diagnosis==
Impetigo is usually diagnosed based on its appearance. It generally appears as honey-colored scabs formed from dried sebum and is often found on the arms, legs, or face. If a visual diagnosis is unclear a culture may be done to test for resistant bacteria.

===Differential diagnosis===
Other conditions that can result in symptoms similar to the common form include contact dermatitis, herpes simplex virus, discoid lupus, and scabies.

Other conditions that can result in symptoms similar to the blistering form include other bullous skin diseases, burns, and necrotizing fasciitis.

==Prevention==
To prevent the spread of impetigo the skin and any open wounds should be kept clean and covered. Care should be taken to keep fluids from an infected person away from the skin of a non-infected person. Washing hands, linens, and affected areas will lower the likelihood of contact with infected fluids. Scratching can spread the sores; keeping nails short will reduce the chances of spreading. Infected people should avoid contact with others and eliminate sharing of clothing or linens. Children with impetigo can return to school 24 hours after starting antibiotic therapy as long as their draining lesions are covered.

==Treatment==
Antibiotics, either as a cream or by mouth, are usually prescribed. Mild cases may be treated with mupirocin ointments. In 95% of cases, a single seven-day antibiotic course results in resolution in children. It has been advocated that topical antiseptics are inferior to topical antibiotics, and therefore should not be used as a replacement. However, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as of February 2020 recommends a hydrogen peroxide 1% cream antiseptic rather than topical antibiotics for localised non-bullous impetigo in otherwise well individuals. This recommendation is part of an effort to reduce the overuse of antimicrobials that may contribute to the development of resistant organisms such as MRSA.

More severe cases require oral antibiotics, such as dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, or erythromycin. Alternatively, amoxicillin combined with clavulanate potassium, cephalosporins (first-generation) and many others may also be used as an antibiotic treatment. Alternatives for people who are seriously allergic to penicillin or infections with methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphococcus aureus&quot; include doxycycline, clindamycin, and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, although doxycycline should not be used in children under the age of eight years old due to the risk of drug-induced tooth discolouration. When streptococci alone are the cause, penicillin is the drug of choice. When the condition presents with ulcers, valacyclovir, an antiviral, may be given in case a viral infection is causing the ulcer.

==Prognosis==
Without treatment, individuals with impetigo typically get better within three weeks. Complications may include cellulitis or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Rheumatic fever does not appear to be related.

==Epidemiology==
Globally, impetigo affects more than 162 million children in low- to middle-income countries. The rates are highest in countries with low available resources and is especially prevalent in the region of Oceania. The tropical climate and high population in lower socioeconomic regions contribute to these high rates. Children under the age of 4 in the United Kingdom are 2.8% more likely than average to contract impetigo; this decreases to 1.6% for children up to 15 years old. As age increases, the rate of impetigo declines, but all ages are still susceptible.

==History==
Impetigo was originally described and differentiated by the English dermatologist William Tilbury Fox around 1864. The word &quot;impetigo&quot; is the generic Latin word for &#x27;skin eruption&#x27;, and it stems from the verb &#x27;to attack&#x27; (as in &quot;impetus&quot;). Before the discovery of antibiotics, the disease was treated with an application of the antiseptic gentian violet, which was an effective treatment.

<text>George Calvin Day (November 8, 1871 – November 3, 1940) was a rear admiral of the United States Navy, whose career lasted from the 1890s until the mid-1930s.

==Biography==
Born in Bradford, Vermont, the son of Hezron George Day, on 8 November 1871, he was appointed to the United States Naval Academy on 19 May 1888 by Congressman William W. Grout. Day graduated from the Naval Academy on 3 June 1892, was promoted to Ensign on 1 July 1894, Lieutenant (junior grade) on 3 March 1899, and Lieutenant in 1901. He served aboard the gunboat during the Spanish–American War, and then served aboard the protected cruiser during the Philippine Insurrection and the Boxer Rebellion. Returning to the United States in 1901, Day was assigned to the Boston Navy Yard and subsequently was Executive Officer of the transport during 1907.

From 1907 to 1909, at the rank of Lieutenant Commander, he served as Navigator of the flagship and &quot;ex officio&quot; Fleet Navigator during the &#x27;round the world cruise of the Great White Fleet. He commanded the destroyer from 1909 to 1910, and Division 7 of the Torpedo Squadron, Atlantic Fleet, from 1910 to 1911. He was in charge of the Navy Publicity Bureau in New York City from 1911 to 1913, was the Executive Officer of the battleship from 1914 to 1915 during the occupation of Veracruz, and commanded the armored cruiser from 1915 to 1916.

By 1917 he was the Head of the Department of Compasses, Nautical Instruments, and Time Service at the Naval Observatory. During World War I, in the rank of Captain, he commanded the troop transport , formerly the German liner SS &quot;Amerika&quot;, and was awarded the Navy Cross for this service. He commanded the armored cruiser from 1918 to 1919 and the battleship from 1920 to 1921, and was Commander, Submarines, Pacific, 1923 to 1925.

In 1923 he was a member of the Navy&#x27;s Court of Inquiry on the Honda Point disaster. Promoted to Rear Admiral in 1925, he served first as Commandant of the 15th Naval District, and then as Commander of Light Cruiser Division 2 (, , and ) from June 1927 to April 1928 and Light Cruiser Division 3 (, and ) from April 1928 to July 1929. He was President of the Board of Inspection and Survey in 1929, was a member of the General Board in 1930 and again was President of the Board of Inspection and Survey from 1931 until his retirement in 1935.

<text>Springfield is the most populous city in and the seat of Hampden County, Massachusetts, United States. Springfield sits on the eastern bank of the Connecticut River near its confluence with three rivers: the western Westfield River, the eastern Chicopee River, and the eastern Mill River. At the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 155,929, making it the third most populous city in the U.S. state of Massachusetts and the fourth most populous city in New England after Boston, Worcester, and Providence. Metropolitan Springfield, as one of two metropolitan areas in Massachusetts (the other being Greater Boston), had a population of 699,162 in 2020.

Springfield was founded in 1636, the first Springfield in the New World. In the late 1700s, during the American Revolution, Springfield was designated by George Washington as the site of the Springfield Armory because of its central location. Subsequently it was the site of Shays&#x27; Rebellion. The city would also play a pivotal role in the Civil War, as a stop on the Underground Railroad and home of abolitionist John Brown, widely known for his raid on Harpers Ferry, and for the Armory&#x27;s manufacture of the famed &quot;Springfield rifles&quot; used ubiquitously by Union troops. Closing during the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, today the national park site features the largest collection of historic American firearms in the world.

Today the city is the largest in western New England, and the urban, economic, and media capital of Massachusetts&#x27; section of the Connecticut River Valley, colloquially known as the Pioneer Valley.
Springfield has several nicknames—&quot;The City of Firsts&quot;, due to the many innovations developed there, such as the first American dictionary, the first American gas-powered automobile, and the first machining lathe for interchangeable parts; &quot;The City of Homes&quot;, due to its Victorian residential architecture; and &quot;Hoop City&quot;, as basketball was invented in Springfield in 1891 by Canadian James Naismith.

Hartford, the capital of Connecticut, lies south of Springfield, on the western bank of the Connecticut River. The Hartford–Springfield region is known as the Knowledge Corridor because it hosts over 160,000 university students and over 32 universities and liberal arts colleges—the second-highest concentration of higher-learning institutions in the United States. The city of Springfield itself is home to Springfield College, Western New England University, American International College, and Springfield Technical Community College, among other higher educational institutions.
==History==

=== Prehistory ===
The area that would become Springfield was historically inhabited by indigenous people, with documented middle archaic period sites, a ceramic workshop site from the Woodland period in south Springfield, and the contact period Long Hill site, excavated in 1895.

At the time of European contact at settlement, the Springfield area was inhabited by the Agawam tribe, who sold land to English settlers.

=== Colonial period ===
Springfield was founded in 1636 by English Puritan William Pynchon as &quot;Agawam Plantation&quot; under the administration of the Connecticut Colony. In 1641 it was renamed after Pynchon&#x27;s hometown of Springfield, Essex, England, following incidents, including trade disputes as well as Captain John Mason&#x27;s hostilities toward native tribes, which precipitated the settlement&#x27;s joining the Massachusetts Bay Colony. During its early existence, Springfield flourished both as an agricultural settlement and as a trading post, although its prosperity waned dramatically during (and after) King Philip&#x27;s War in 1675, when natives laid siege to it and burned it to the ground. During that attack, three-quarters of the original settlement was burned to the ground, with many of Springfield&#x27;s residents survived by taking refuge in John Pynchon&#x27;s brick house, the &quot;Old Fort&quot;, the first such house to be built in the Connecticut River Valley. Out of the siege, Miles Morgan and his sons were lauded as heroes; as one of the few homesteads to survive the attack, alerting troops in Hadley, as well as Toto, often referred to as the &quot;Windsor Indian&quot; who, running 20 miles from Windsor, Connecticut, to the settlement, was able to give advance warning of the attack.

The original settlement—today&#x27;s downtown Springfield—was located atop bluffs at the confluence of four rivers, at the nexus of trade routes to Boston, Albany, New York City, and Montreal, and with some of the northeastern United States&#x27; most fertile soil.

=== Post-colonial period ===
In 1777, Springfield&#x27;s location at numerous crossroads led George Washington and Henry Knox to establish the United States&#x27; National Armory at Springfield, which produced the first American musket in 1794, and later the famous Springfield rifle. From 1777 until its closing during the Vietnam War, the Springfield Armory attracted skilled laborers to Springfield, making it the United States&#x27; longtime center for precision manufacturing. The near-capture of the armory during Shays&#x27; Rebellion of 1787 led directly to the formation of the U.S. Constitutional Convention.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, Springfielders produced many innovations, including the first American-English dictionary (1805, Merriam-Webster); the first use of interchangeable parts and the assembly line in manufacturing (1819, Thomas Blanchard); the first American horseless car (1825, Thomas Blanchard); the mass production of vulcanized rubber (1844, Charles Goodyear); the first American gasoline-powered car (1893, Duryea Brothers); the first successful motorcycle company (1901, &quot;Indian&quot;); one of America&#x27;s first commercial radio stations (1921, WBZ, broadcast from the Hotel Kimball); and most famously, the world&#x27;s second-most-popular sport, basketball (1891, Dr. James Naismith). Springfield would play major roles in machine production, initially driven by the arms industry of the Armory, as well as from private companies such as Smith &amp; Wesson, established by Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson. Similarly, the industrial economy led Thomas and Charles Wason to establish the Wason Manufacturing Company, which produced the first manufactured sleeping car. The largest railcar works in New England, Wason produced 100 cars a day at its peak; the company was eventually purchased by Brill in 1907 and closed during the Depression in 1937. Among numerous other industries, during the first half of the 20th century Springfield also produced brass goods, chemicals, clothing and knit goods, paper goods, watches, boilers, engines, manufacturing machinery, silverware, jewelry, skates, carriages, buttons, needles, toys, and printed books and magazines.

Springfield underwent a protracted decline during the second half of the 20th century, due largely to the decommissioning of the Springfield Armory in 1969; poor city planning decisions, such as the location of the elevated I-91 along the city&#x27;s Connecticut River front; and overall decline of industry throughout the northeastern United States. During the 1980s and 1990s, Springfield developed a national reputation for crime, political corruption, and cronyism. During the early 21st century, Springfield saw long-term revitalization projects and several large projects, including the $1 billion New Haven–Hartford–Springfield intercity rail; a $1 billion MGM casino., and the $95 million redevelopment of Springfield Union Station. In December 2022, Springfield was designated by the National Park Service as an American World War II Heritage City, the first in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and one of only 18 communities in the country.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 3.65%, are water. Once nicknamed &quot;The City in a Forest&quot;, Springfield features over of urban parkland, 12% of its total land area.

Located in the fertile Connecticut River Valley, surrounded by mountains, bluffs, and rolling hills in all cardinal directions, Springfield sits on the eastern bank of the Connecticut River, near its confluence with two major tributary rivers—the western Westfield River, which flows into the Connecticut opposite Springfield&#x27;s South End Bridge; and the eastern Chicopee River, which flows into the Connecticut less than north of Springfield, in the city of Chicopee (which constituted one of Springfield&#x27;s most populous neighborhoods until it separated and became an independent municipality in 1852). The Connecticut state line is only south of Springfield, beside the wealthy suburb of Longmeadow, which itself separated from Springfield in 1783.

Springfield&#x27;s densely urban Metro Center district surrounding Main Street is relatively flat, and follows the north–south trajectory of the Connecticut River; however, as one moves eastward, the city becomes increasingly hilly.

Aside from its rivers, Springfield&#x27;s second most prominent topographical feature is the city&#x27;s Forest Park. Forest Park lies in the southwestern corner of the city, surrounded by Springfield&#x27;s attractive garden districts, Forest Park and Forest Park Heights, which feature over 600 Victorian Painted Lady mansions. Forest Park also borders Longmeadow. Springfield shares borders with other suburbs such as East Longmeadow, Wilbraham, Ludlow and the city of Chicopee. The small cities of Agawam and West Springfield lie less than a mile (1.6 km) from Springfield&#x27;s Metro Center, across the Connecticut River.

The City of Springfield also owns the Springfield Country Club, located in the autonomous city of West Springfield, which separated from Springfield in 1774.

===Climate===

Springfield, like other cities in southern New England, has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfa&quot;) with four distinct seasons and precipitation evenly distributed throughout the year, but the intensity (and sometimes the duration) of warmer periods is greater than in northern areas. Winters are cold with a daily average in January of around . During winter, nor&#x27;easter storms can drop significant snowfalls on Springfield and the Connecticut River Valley. Temperatures below can occur each year, though the area does not experience the high snowfall amounts and blustery wind averages of nearby cities such as Worcester, Massachusetts, and Albany, New York.

Springfield&#x27;s summers are very warm and sometimes humid. During summer, several times per month, on hot days afternoon thunderstorms will develop when unstable warm air collides with approaching cold fronts. The daily average in July is around . Usually several days during the summer exceed , constituting a &quot;heat wave&quot;. Spring and fall temperatures are usually pleasant, with mild days and crisp, cool nights. Precipitation averages annually, and snowfall averages , most of which falls from mid-December to early March. Although not unheard of, extreme weather events like hurricanes and tornadoes occur infrequently in Springfield compared with other areas in the country. On the occasions that hurricanes have hit New England, Springfield&#x27;s inland, upriver location has caused its damages to be considerably less than shoreline cities like New Haven, Connecticut, and Providence, Rhode Island.

On June 1, 2011, Springfield was directly struck by the second-largest tornado ever to hit Massachusetts. With wind speeds exceeding , the tornado left three dead, hundreds injured, and over 500 homeless in the city alone. The tornado caused hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage to Springfield and wrought significant destruction in a path from Westfield to Charlton, Massachusetts. It was the first deadly tornado to strike Massachusetts since May 29, 1995.

In 2010, Springfield ranked 35th in the United States&#x27; City Crime Rankings—its second-lowest ranking in recent years, (in 2009, it ranked 51st). Springfield&#x27;s 2010 crime rating of 142 is down approximately 50% from its heights in the late 1990s and 2000s.

The Urban Land Institute stated in 2010 that &quot;the perception of crime [in Springfield] appears to be worse than the reality&quot;.

By another measure, crime and population data collected by the FBI, and indexed by NeighborhoodScout showed between 2010 and 2018 the violent crime rate for Springfield decreased by approximately 52.5%, whereas the property crime rate declined by 54%; both rates remain more than twice their respective state averages, as of 2018.

==Economy==


Springfield&#x27;s vicinity to both Boston and New York City lends it a location well suited for distribution, and in the past this has played a significant role in its economy. For this reason in the early 20th century it was the largest producer in New England of commercially produced cakes and pastries, and among the largest in bread—with one 1926 estimate of 1.4 million loaves of bread and 14 million breakfast rolls produced in the city on a weekly basis.

Today Springfield&#x27;s top five industries (in order, by number of workers) are: Education and Health Services; Trade and Transportation; Manufacturing; Tourism and Hospitality; and Professional &amp; Business Services. Springfield is considered to have a &quot;mature economy&quot;, which protects the city to a degree during recessions and inhibits it somewhat during bubbles. Springfield is considered to have one of America&#x27;s top emerging multi-cultural markets—the city features a 33% Latino population with buying power that has increased over 295% from 1990 to 2006. As of 2006, more than 60% of Hispanic Springfielders had arrived in the city since 1986.

With 25 universities and colleges within a radius from Springfield, including several universities and liberal arts colleges, and more than six institutions within the city itself, the Hartford–Springfield metropolitan area has been dubbed the Knowledge Corridor by regional educators, civic authorities, and businessmen—touting its 32 universities and liberal arts colleges, numerous highly regarded hospitals, and nearly 120,000 students. The Knowledge Corridor universities and colleges provide the region with an educated workforce, which yields a yearly GDP of over $100 billion—more than at least 16 U.S. States. Hartford–Springfield has become home to a number of biotech firms and high-speed computing centers. As of 2009 Springfield ranks as the 24th most important high-tech center in the United States with approximately 14,000 high-tech jobs.

In 2010, the median household income was $35,236. Median income for the family was $51,110. The per capita income was $16,863. About 21.3% of families and 26.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 40.0% of those under age 18 and 17.5% of those age 65 or over.

==Arts and culture==
===Cuisine===
Springfield&#x27;s mosaic of ethnic communities have long played a role in its culinary institutions, with many newer smaller restaurants and several decades-old establishments in its downtown.

Springfield is home to five distinct museums at the Quadrangle, along with the ornate Springfield City Library—an architecturally significant example of the City Beautiful movement. The Quadrangle&#x27;s five distinct collections include the Dr. Seuss National Memorial Sculpture Garden; the largest collection of Chinese cloisonne outside of China; and the original casting of Augustus Saint Gaudens&#x27;s most famous sculpture, &quot;Puritan&quot;.

The Quadrangle&#x27;s five museums are the Museum of Fine Arts, which features a large Impressionist collection; the George Walter Vincent Smith Art Museum, a collection of Asian curiosities; the Springfield Science Museum, which features a life-size Tyrannosaurus Rex, an aquarium and the first American-made planetarium, designed and built (1937) by Frank Korkosz; the Amazing World of Dr. Seuss Museum, as Springfield is the birthplace of Theodor Geisel; and the Lyman and Merrie Wood Museum of Springfield History, a museum about the multi-faceted city.

The Connecticut Valley Historical Museum was one of the Quadrangle&#x27;s five museums until 2009.

In 2017 the Amazing World of Dr. Seuss Museum opened in the former location, the William Pynchon Memorial Building. The collections of the Connecticut Valley Historical Museum are now located in the Lyman and Merrie Wood Museum of Springfield History.

* Court Square: a park, referred to as &quot;Springfield&#x27;s front door&quot;, it remains the city&#x27;s only topographical constant since its founding in 1636. Located on Main Street and surrounded by ornate architecture, including the iconic Springfield Municipal Group, Court Square is the civic heart of Springfield. Until the 1960s, Court Square extended to the Connecticut River; however, as with Forest Park, its connection to the river was severed by the building of the Interstate 91 elevated highway.

* St. John&#x27;s Congregational Church: founded in 1844 as the Sanford Street &quot;Free Church&quot;, St. John&#x27;s Congregational Church is a predominately black church that played a pivotal role in the abolitionist movement. While living in Springfield, John Brown attended services here from 1846 to 1850, and as of 2011, the church still displays &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Bible&quot;. It was at this church where John Brown met Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, and other prominent abolitionists—and where he later founded the militant &quot;League of Gileadites&quot; in response to the Fugitive Slave Act. As of 2011, St. John&#x27;s remains one of the most prominent, predominately black congregations in the Northeastern United States.

Today, it is a National Historic Site, and features a museum that includes one of the world&#x27;s largest collections of firearms.
* Springfield Cemetery: opened in 1841 and located in the heart of the city, it is designed in the scenic rural cemetery tradition. The cemetery is the final resting place of many pioneer settlers and noted individuals from Springfield and the region.
* Symphony Hall: dedicated in 1913 by President William Howard Taft as part of the Springfield Municipal Group, Springfield Symphony Hall features &quot;perfect acoustics&quot;. It is home to the Springfield Symphony Orchestra, and also hosts Broadway touring productions.

It features ornate architectural and sculptural details from the original team&#x27;s design; however, most of those were meant to accompany The Puritan, and thus moved to storage. Stearns Square hosts a large motorcycle gathering each Thursday evening, and is the site of a summer concert series.

===Architecture===

In addition to its nickname &quot;The City of Firsts&quot;, Springfield is known as &quot;The City of Homes&quot; for its attractive architecture, which differentiates it from most medium-size, Northeastern American cities. Most of Springfield&#x27;s housing stock consists of Victorian &quot;Painted Ladies&quot; (similar to those found in San Francisco); however, Springfield also features Gilded Age mansions, urban condominiums buildings, brick apartment blocks, and more suburban post-World War II architecture (in the Sixteen Acres and Pine Point neighborhoods). While Springfield&#x27;s architecture is attractive, much of its built-environment stems from the 19th and early 20th centuries when the city experienced a period of &quot;intense and concentrated prosperity&quot;—today, its Victorian architecture can be found in various states of rehabilitation and disrepair. As of 2011, Springfield&#x27;s housing prices are considerably lower than nearby New England cities which do not feature such intricate architecture.

In Metro Center, stands the two prominent skyscrapers, Tower Square, and Monarch Place, the latter of which is the tallest building in Massachusetts outside of Boston. Many of the city&#x27;s Victorian buildings including former hotels, factories, and other institutions have been converted into apartment buildings and luxury condominiums. For example, Springfield&#x27;s ornate Classical High School (235 State Street), with its immense Victorian atrium—where Dr. Seuss, Timothy Leary, and Taj Mahal all went to high school—is now a luxury condominium building. The Hotel Kimball, (140 Chestnut Street), which hosted several U.S. Presidents as guests and once featured the United States&#x27; first commercial radio station (WBZ), has been converted into The Kimball Towers Condominiums. The former McIntosh Shoe Company (158 Chestnut Street), one of Springfield&#x27;s finest examples of the Chicago School of Architecture, has been converted into industrial-style condominiums; and the red-brick, former Milton Bradley toy factory is now Stockbridge Court Apartments (45 Willow Street). In the Ridgewood Historic District, the 1950s-futurist Mulberry House (101 Mulberry Street), is now a condominium building that features some of the finest views of Springfield.

Forest Park (and Forest Park Heights), surrounding by the Forest Park, is a New England Garden District featuring more than 600 Victorian Painted Ladies. The McKnight National Historic District, America&#x27;s first planned residential neighborhood, (1881), features more than 900 Victorian Painted Ladies, many of which have been rehabilitated by Springfield&#x27;s growing LGBT community. The Old Hill, Upper Hill, and Bay neighborhoods also feature this type of architecture.

Maple High, which is architecturally (and geographically) distinct from, but often included with Springfield&#x27;s economically depressed Six Corners neighborhood, was Springfield&#x27;s first &quot;Gold Coast&quot;. Many mansions from the early 19th century and later gilded age stand atop a bluff on Maple Street, overlooking the Connecticut River. The Ridgewood Historic district on Ridgewood and Mulberry Streets also feature historic mansions from the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Springfield—like many mid-size Northeastern cities, e.g., Hartford, Albany, and New Haven—from the 1950s to the 1970s, razed a significant number of historic commercial buildings in the name of urban renewal. In 1961, this included Unity Church, the first building designed by the young Henry Hobson Richardson. Springfield&#x27;s Metro Center remains more aesthetically cohesive than many its peer cities; however, as elsewhere, the city currently features a patchwork of parking lots and grand old buildings. Current efforts are underway to improve the cohesion of Springfield&#x27;s Metro Center, including the completed Main Street and State Street Corridor improvement projects, the upcoming $70 million renovation to Springfield&#x27;s 1926 Union Station and the renovation of the Epiphany Tower on State Street into a new hotel. New constructions include the architecturally award-winning, $57 million Moshe Safdie-designed Federal Building on State Street.

===Public library===

Efforts to establish a public library began in the 1850s. In fiscal year 2008, the city of Springfield spent 1.13% ($5,321,151) of its budget on its public library—approximately $35 per person, per year ($46.12 adjusted for inflation to 2022). In fiscal year 2009, Springfield spent about 1% ($5,077,158) of its budget on the library—approximately $32 per person, per year ($42.32 adjusted for inflation to 2022). Springfield has Massachusetts&#x27; 2nd largest library circulation, behind Boston.

As of 2012, the public library purchases access for its patrons to databases owned by the following companies:

* EBSCO Industries
* Foundation Center
* Gale, of Cengage Learning
* Infobase Publishing
* LearningExpress, LLC
* Merriam-Webster, Inc.
* NewsBank, Inc.
* Oxford University Press
* ProQuest (products include Massachusetts Newsstand)
==Sports==
Besides Springfield&#x27;s historic connection with basketball, the city has a rich sporting history. Volleyball was invented in the adjacent city of Holyoke, and the first exhibition match was held in 1896 at the International YMCA Training School, now known as Springfield College.

Ice hockey has been played professionally in Springfield since the 1920s, and Springfield is home to the league headquarters of the American Hockey League. The Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League (now located in Utica, New York) was the oldest minor league hockey franchise in existence. In 1994 the team relocated to Worcester and was replaced by the Springfield Falcons, who played at the MassMutual Center. The Falcons were then replaced by the Springfield Thunderbirds in 2016. For parts of two seasons (1978–1980) the NHL Hartford Whalers played in Springfield while their arena was undergoing repairs after a roof collapse. It hosted Game 1 and Game 2 of the 1978 Avco Cup Final. On the amateur level, the Junior A Springfield Olympics played for many years at the Olympia, while American International College&#x27;s Yellow Jackets compete in NCAA Division I hockey.

Basketball remains a popular sport in Springfield&#x27;s sporting landscape. Springfield is currently home to the Western Mass Zombies a minor league basketball team participating in the East Coast Basketball League. The Zombies in 2021 were named ECBL Mid-Atlantic Champions. Prior to the 2014–2015 season, Springfield was home to the Springfield Armor of the NBA Development League, which began play in 2009 at the MassMutual Center. Beginning in the 2011–2012 season, the Armor was the exclusive affiliate of the Brooklyn Nets. For many years, the Hall of Fame Tip-Off Classic has been the semi-official start to the college basketball season, and the NCAA Division II championships are usually held in Springfield. The Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference played its championships in Springfield from 2012 to 2014. The New England Blizzard of the ABL played its first game in Springfield, and several minor pro men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams have called the city home, including the Springfield Fame of the United States Basketball League (the league&#x27;s inaugural champion in 1985) and the Springfield Hall of Famers of the Eastern Professional Basketball League.

Springfield has had professional baseball in the past. The Springfield Giants of the Single- and Double-A Eastern League played between 1957 and 1965. The team was quite successful, winning consecutive championships in 1959, 1960 and 1961, by startling coincidence the same seasons in which the Springfield Indians won three straight Calder Cup championships in hockey. The Giants played at Pynchon Park by the Connecticut River until relocating after the 1965 season. Pynchon Park&#x27;s grandstands were destroyed by fire the year after in 1966. Before that time, the Springfield Cubs played in the minor league New England League from 1946 until 1949, after which the league folded; they then played in the International League until 1953. For many years before the Giants, Springfield was also a member of the Eastern League, between 1893 and 1943. In general, the team was named the Ponies, but it also carried the nicknames of &quot;Maroons&quot; (1895), &quot;Green Sox&quot; (1917), &quot;Hampdens&quot; (1920–1921), &quot;Rifles (1932, 1942–1943) and &quot;Nationals&quot; (1939–1941). The team located closest are the Valley Blue Sox of the New England Collegiate Baseball League who play their games in nearby Holyoke, but house their team offices at 100 Congress Street in Springfield.

==Parks and recreation==
In 2010, Springfield was cited as the fourth &quot;Greenest City&quot; in the United States—the largest city cited in the Top 10. The recognition noted Springfield&#x27;s numerous parks, the purity of its drinking water, its regional recycling center, and organizations like ReStore Home Improvement Center, which salvages building materials. Springfield features over of parkland distributed among 35 urban parks, including the grand, Forest Park. Well-known parks include the following, among others:
* Apremont Triangle Park is a triangular, pocket park in front of Springfield&#x27;s historic Kimball Towers in Metro Center. Named for Springfield&#x27;s 104th Infantry Regiment, which following the World War I Battle of Apremont, became the first U.S. military unit awarded for heroism by a foreign power, receiving France&#x27;s highest military honor: the for bravery in combat. The same Springfield unit received the same honor again in World War II. Apremont Triangle Park, steps from both the bohemian Kimball Towers and upper-class Quadrangle-Mattoon Street Historic District offers a place to sit amidst the restaurants on the northern fringe of the Club Quarter.
* Armoury Commons is a rectangular park just south of the Springfield Armory, located at the corner of Pearl and Spring Streets in Metro Center. Renovated in 2009, Armoury Commons features several sculptures, including Pynchon Park&#x27;s original sculpture. The park is often used as a place to play chess and other games.
* Connecticut River Walk Park is a narrow, landscaped park that snakes along the scenic Connecticut River for several miles. Beginning near the Basketball Hall of Fame, it features jogging trails, benches, boat docks, and plazas—all of which afford scenic vistas of the Connecticut River and Connecticut River Valley. However, Interstate 91&#x27;s position, height, and ancillary structures—including a 1,756-car, below-grade parking lot (the largest in the city), and stone walls block all views of the Connecticut River, and all but three passages to the park from Metro Center. Despite Springfield&#x27;s rating as one of the most walkable cities in the U.S., due to the poor planning of I-91, this park can be difficult to reach on foot.
* Court Square has been Springfield&#x27;s one topographical constant since colonial days—it is located in Metro Center. Featuring monuments to Springfield&#x27;s hero during King Philip&#x27;s War of 1675, Miles Morgan; President William McKinley; and a Civil War memorial Court Square is surrounded by extraordinarily fine architecture, including H.H. Richardson&#x27;s Richardsonian Romanesque Courthouse; the Springfield Municipal Group featuring the Greek Revival City Hall, Symphony Hall, and the Italianate Campanile; and also the 1819 reconstruction of the 1638 Old First Church. Other buildings included are the One Financial Plaza skyscraper, UMass Amherst&#x27;s Urban Design Studio in the Byers Block (b. 1835); and, across Main Street, the MassMutual Center arena and convention center.
* Five Mile Pond is a Naturalist park and pond approximately from Springfield&#x27;s Metro Center in the Pine Point neighborhood of Springfield. There are several, glacial lakes in the Five Mile Pond area, including Lake Lorraine, Loon Pond, and Long Pond. Five Mile Pond is popular with boaters.
* Forest Park is one of the United States&#x27; largest urban parks (at ) and also one of its most historically important urban parks.

* Van Horn Park is a large park in the Hungry Hill section of Liberty Heights in Springfield. It features two ponds and a reservoir. The Reservoir and lower dam are not generally accessible to the public. The Main Entrance is on Armory Street near Chapin Terrace.

==Government==
===City of Springfield===

Springfield employs a strong-mayor form of city government. Springfield&#x27;s mayor is Domenic J. Sarno, who has been serving since 2008.

The city&#x27;s governmental bureaucracy consists of 33 departments, which administer a wide array of municipal services, e.g. police, fire, public works, parks, public health, housing, economic development, and the Springfield Public School System, New England&#x27;s 2nd largest public school system.

Springfield&#x27;s legislative body is its City Council, which features a mix of eight ward representatives—even though the city has more than twice that many neighborhoods, resulting in several incongruous &quot;wards&quot;—and five at-large city representatives, several of whom have served for well over a decade.

====Finances====

In 2003, the City of Springfield was on the brink of financial default, and thus taken over by a Commonwealth-appointed Finance Control Board until 2009. Disbanded in June of that year, the Control Board made great strides stabilizing Springfield&#x27;s finances. While Springfield has achieved balanced budgets since 2009, the city has not enlarged its tax base, and thus many of its public works projects—which have been in the pipeline for years, some even decades—remain unfinished (e.g., repairs to Springfield&#x27;s landmark Campanile). The construction of MGM Springfield, which opened in 2018, fueled a number of projects in the years leading up to and after its opening, with an estimated $3 billion of new development and infrastructure spending materializing.

Building off of the work of the Control Board, the city&#x27;s finances have remained stable under Mayor Domenic J. Sarno&#x27;s (2008–present) despite the Great Recession and several natural and man made disasters: June 1, 2011, tornado Springfield Tornado, Hurricane Irene, a freak October snow storm (which in some ways was more damaging than the tornado), and a large gas explosion in the downtown area in 2012. The city has recovered, however receiving a bond upgrade from Standard and Poor&#x27;s Investment Services and the GFOA&#x27;s Distinguished Budget Award for six consecutive years.

===Judicial system===

Like every other municipality in Massachusetts, Springfield has no judicial branch itself. Rather, it uses the Springfield-based state courts, which include Springfield district court and Hampden County Superior Court, both of which are based in Springfield. The Federal District Court also regularly hears cases in Springfield—now in an architecturally award-winning building on State Street, constructed in 2009.

===Politics===


Springfield became a city on May 25, 1852, by decree of the Massachusetts Legislature, after a decade-long internal dispute that resulted in the partition of Chicopee from Springfield, and thus the loss of two fifths of the city&#x27;s population.

Springfield, like all municipalities in Massachusetts, is subject to limited home rule municipal power. The current city charter, in effect since 1959, uses a &quot;strong mayor&quot; government with most power concentrated in the mayor, as in Boston and elsewhere. The mayor representing the city&#x27;s executive branch presents the budget, appoints commissioners and department heads, and in general runs the city. The mayor is former City Councilor Domenic Sarno, elected November 6, 2007, by a margin of 52.54% to 47.18% against incumbent Charles Ryan. He took office in January 2008. In November 2009 and 2011, Sarno won reelection, albeit—in the latter case—with just 22% of eligible Springfield voters voting.

The Springfield City Council, consisting of thirteen members, is the city&#x27;s legislative branch. Elected every odd numbered year, eight of its members are elected to represent &quot;wards&quot;, which are made of (sometimes incongruous) groupings of Springfield neighborhoods, e.g. Springfield&#x27;s ethnic North End neighborhoods—Memorial Square and Brightwood—share a ward with Metro Center, Springfield&#x27;s downtown. Five city council members are elected at-large. The City Council passes the city&#x27;s budget, holds hearings, creates departments and commissions, and amends zoning laws.

The mayor&#x27;s office and city council chambers are located in city hall—part of the Municipal Group in Metro Center, Springfield. The Finance Control Board met there as well.

Springfield is heavily Democratic. In the 2020 US Presidential Election Democrat Joe Biden received 72.4 percent of the vote to Republican Donald Trump&#x27;s 25.7 percent.

===Switch to ward representation===
In the past, efforts have been made to provide each of the city&#x27;s eight wards a seat in the city council, instead of the current at-large format. There would still be some at-large seats under this format. The primary argument for this has been that City Councilors live in only four of the city&#x27;s wards. An initiative to change the composition failed to pass the City Council twice. In 2007 Mayor Charles V. Ryan and City Councilor Jose Tosado proposed a home-rule amendment that would expand the council to thirteen members adding four seats to the existing nine member at large system, but allocated between eight ward and five at large seats. This home-rule petition was adopted by the City Council 8–1, and was later passed by the State Senate and House and signed by the Governor. On election day, November 6, 2007, city residents voted overwhelmingly in favor of changing the City Council and School Committee. The ballot initiative that established a new council with five at-large seats and eight ward seats passed 3–1. On November 3, 2009, Springfield held its first ward elections in 50 years.

===State and federal representation===
The State Representatives are Orlando Ramos, Carlos González, Bud Williams, and Angelo Puppolo. The State Senator is Adam Gomez. Springfield is part of the Eighth Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council district and is represented by Tara Jacobs (D-North Adams).

Richard Neal represents United States House of Representatives, Massachusetts District 1, and Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey represent Springfield in the Federal Senate.

==Education==

===Grade schools===
The Springfield Plan for citizenship education drew national attention in the 1940s for its efforts to combat racism.

====Public schools (K–12)====

Springfield has the second-largest school district in Massachusetts and in New England. It operates 38 elementary schools, six high schools, six middle schools (6–8), and seven specialized schools. The main high schools in the city include the High School of Commerce, Springfield Central High School, Roger L Putnam Vocational-Technical High School, and the Springfield High School of Science and Technology, better known as Sci-Tech. There are also two charter secondary schools in the City of Springfield: SABIS International, which ranks among the top 5% of high schools nationally in academic quality, and the Hampden Charter School of Science.

The city is required under a 1970s court order to balance schools racially, which had necessitated busing. However, since then, the city and the school&#x27;s population has shifted and many of the neighborhoods are more integrated, calling into question the need for busing at all.

In June 2015, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker announced $3.2 million in grants to three underperforming middle schools in Springfield.

====Private schools====

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield operated five Catholic elementary schools in the city, all of which were consolidated into a single entity, St. Michael&#x27;s Academy, in the autumn of 2009. The non-denominational Pioneer Valley Christian Academy is located in the suburban Sixteen Acres neighborhood, educating K–12. Non-sectarian elementary schools within the City of Springfield include the Pioneer Valley Montessori School in Springfield&#x27;s Sixteen Acres neighborhood and Orchard Children&#x27;s Corner in suburban Indian Orchard, a Pre-Kindergarten, among others.

The diocese runs Pope Francis Preparatory School (previously Cathedral High School), which is the largest Catholic high school in Western Massachusetts. Two nonsectarian private schools are also located in Springfield: Commonwealth Academy located on the former campus of the MacDuffie School (which moved to Granby, Massachusetts, in 2011 after 130 years in Springfield), and teaches grades four through twelve, soon to enroll students in grades K–12; and the Academy Hill School, which teaches kindergarten through grade eight.

Within of Springfield are many private prep schools, which can serve as day schools for Springfield students; they include the Williston Northampton School in Easthampton, Massachusetts; Wilbraham &amp; Monson Academy in Wilbraham, Massachusetts; and Suffield Academy in Suffield, Connecticut.

===Higher education===

====Universities and colleges====

The Knowledge Corridor boasts the second-largest concentration of higher learning institutions in the United States, with 32 universities and liberal arts colleges and over 160,000 university students in Greater Hartford–Springfield. This includes two college consortia, the Five Colleges, and the Cooperating Colleges of Greater Springfield, whose member institutions often collaborate in greater outreach programs. Within of Springfield&#x27;s Metro Center, there are 18 universities and liberal arts colleges, which enroll approximately 100,000 students.

As of 2015, Springfield attracts over 20,000 university students per year. Its universities and colleges include Western New England University; Springfield College, famous as the birthplace of the sport of basketball (1891) and the nation&#x27;s first physical education class, (1912); American International College, founded to educate America&#x27;s immigrant population, is notable as the inventor of the Model Congress program. UMass Amherst relocated its urban design center graduate program to Court Square in Metro Center.

Several of Greater Springfield&#x27;s institutions rank among the most prestigious in the world. For example, Amherst College, north of Springfield, and Smith College, north of Springfield, consistently rank among America&#x27;s top 10 liberal arts colleges. Mount Holyoke College—the United States&#x27; first women&#x27;s college—consistently ranks among America&#x27;s Top 15 colleges, and it is located only north of Springfield. Hampshire College is located north of Springfield. The 30,000-student University of Massachusetts Amherst is located north of Springfield. Approximately west of Springfield, across the Memorial Bridge in Westfield, is Westfield State University, founded by noted education reformer Horace Mann. Westfield was the first university in America to admit students without regard to sex, race, or economic status.

Just outside Springfield&#x27;s northern city limits is Elms College, a Catholic college. Likewise, just below Springfield&#x27;s southern city limit in Longmeadow is Bay Path University; both schools were once all-women but are now co-ed.

====Community colleges====

In 1968, following the Pentagon&#x27;s controversial closing of the Springfield Armory, Springfielders founded Springfield Technical Community College on behind the Springfield Armory National Park. Springfield Technical Community College is the only polytechnic community college in Massachusetts, and was founded to continue Springfield&#x27;s tradition of technical innovation.

Holyoke Community College, north of Springfield, offers more traditional community college programming in Greater Springfield, as well as instruction in the culinary arts.

==Media==

===Newspapers===

Springfield&#x27;s largest local newspaper is &quot;The Republican&quot;, which has also previously been known as the &quot;Springfield Union-News &amp; Sunday Republican&quot;, from when it merged with the &quot;Springfield Union&quot;. Smaller papers such as &quot;The Reminder&quot; and the &quot;Valley Advocate&quot; also serve Greater Springfield.

Other newspapers serve specific communities of interest, such as &quot;El Pueblo Latino&quot; and &quot;El Sol Latino&quot;, which serve the Hispanic community, as well as &quot;Unity First&quot; and the &quot;AfAm Point of View&quot;, both of which serve the African-American community, and &quot;The Rainbow Times&quot;, which serves Springfield&#x27;s LGBT community.

===Television===

Springfield has a long history of broadcast television, including two of the oldest UHF television stations on the air today.

====Cable operators====

Springfield proper is serviced exclusively by Comcast cable. Springfield was formerly wired with a &quot;dual plant&quot; cable system from 1980 until 2001, requiring an A/B switch for each home to watch programming and complicating VCR recordings.

===Radio===
Springfield was home to the first commercially licensed radio station in the United States, and the oldest radio station of any kind in New England: WBZ, which broadcast live from Springfield&#x27;s luxurious Hotel Kimball at 140 Chestnut Street (now the Kimball Towers Condominiums) before moving to Boston in 1931.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Springfield is called the &quot;Crossroads of New England&quot; because it is the major shipping nexus from New York City, Boston, Montreal and the Great Lakes (via Albany, New York). Much of the cargo heading from one of these places to another crosses through the City of Springfield. As a geographical trade center, Springfield has more advantages than just being equidistant to these other large trade centers—it sits beside the Connecticut River, is located near some of the most fertile farmland in the Northeast, and is served by numerous rail lines and Interstate Highways, including I-90 (Mass Pike) and I-91, which connect New Haven, Hartford, Holyoke, Northampton, and Vermont to Springfield. One of the few spurs of I-91 in Massachusetts, I-291, runs through Springfield, and provides a secondary connection between I-90 and I-91.

====Rail====
Springfield Union Station, originally opened in 1926 and re-opened in 2017, is served by five Amtrak intercity routes: the &quot;Vermonter&quot;, which runs from Washington, D.C. to St. Albans, Vermont; the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot;, which runs from Chicago to Boston; the Amtrak &quot;Hartford Line&quot;, which runs from Springfield to New Haven; the &quot;Valley Flyer&quot;, which runs from New Haven to Greenfield; and the &quot;Northeast Regional&quot;, which runs from Springfield to D.C./Virginia. Amtrak relocated its operations into Union Station proper from their previous track side station building in June 2019.

CT Rail&#x27;s Hartford Line started operating from Union Station in June 2018, with Springfield as the northern terminus. Trains operate to New Haven, CT with multiple stops in Connecticut along the way. The line shares the same route and station listing as the Amtrak route of the same name, and the two are operated in conjunction as a commuter rail service for the region.

The New Haven–Springfield Line was upgraded in conjunction with the launch of the Hartford Line service. The project received funding from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Federal Government, and the State of Connecticut. Amtrak trains on the route between New Haven and Springfield reach speeds of .

In 2011, Springfield Union Station started a $70 million renovation to become an intermodal transportation facility, allowing Peter Pan Bus, Greyhound Bus, and the PVTA to occupy a modern space next to the renovated Union Station. It was completed in June 2017.

There are no major freight yards in Springfield proper, but Connecticut Southern Railroad and CSX serve CSX&#x27;s West Springfield yard across the Connecticut River.

====Bus====

The Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA) is based in Springfield and uses Union Station as its Springfield hub, next to the Gothic arch that denotes the entrance to downtown Springfield. The PVTA operates nineteen bus routes from Union Station. The PVTA&#x27;s Springfield service area includes Springfield, Holyoke, Chicopee, Westfield, West Springfield, Ludlow, Agawam, and East Longmeadow. With transfers, it is possible to travel into PVTA&#x27;s northern service area, which includes Northampton, Amherst, and Easthampton.

Intercity bus service is provided by Peter Pan Bus Lines and Greyhound Lines, both of which operate from Union Station. They provide service to destinations across the northeast United States.

====Air====

Springfield is primarily served by Bradley International Airport, in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, south of downtown. It features over 100 daily departures to 30 destinations on nine airlines. It is also the primary airport for Hartford.

Other regional airports serving Springfield include:
* Westfield-Barnes Regional Airport is 12 miles (19 km) from downtown Springfield in Westfield, Massachusetts. It is 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from the Massachusetts Turnpike.
* Westover Metropolitan Airport is from downtown Springfield. It is from the Massachusetts Turnpike.
* Logan International Airport in Boston is approximately northeast of Springfield.

====Cycling====

The city&#x27;s Connecticut River Walk Park offers a largely uninterrupted bike route from the North to South End, and is part of a broader plan by the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission to create a continuous route alongside the Connecticut River from Agawam to Holyoke, with construction and planning ongoing.

The city recently partnered with Bewegen (an e-bike share system provider) to install e-bike share stations in both Springfield and West Springfield.

===Water and sewer system===

The Springfield Water and Sewer Commission (created in its current form in 1996) owns several reservoirs and aqueducts, as well as hydropower and sewage treatment stations. The city purchased the Springfield Aqueduct Company in 1872.

Borden Brook Reservoir, located in the rural western Hampden County town of Blandford was completed in 1910. It feeds into the Cobble Mountain Reservoir (completed in 1931) located at the junction of the towns of Blandford, Granville and Russell. The Wild Cat Aqueduct carries water from the Cobble Mountain Reservoir to a hydroelectric generating station on the Granville–Russell border, at the Little River. Drinking water flows to the West Parish Water Filtration Plant in Westfield, and is then pumped to holding tanks at the top of Provin Mountain in Agawam.

The 1875 Ludlow Reservoir, also known as Springfield Reservoir, is maintained as an emergency water supply; it is located in Ludlow and fed via the Broad Brook Canal.

SWSC provides retail water in Springfield and Ludlow; wholesale water to Agawam, East Longmeadow, and Longmeadow; partial or peak service to Southwick, Westfield, and West Springfield; and emergency service to Chicopee and Wilbraham.

===Emergency services===
The Springfield Fire Department provides fire protection and emergency medical services to the city, and is one of the oldest fire departments in the United States.

<text>The Ford Foundation is an American private foundation with the stated goal of advancing human welfare. Created in 1936 by Edsel Ford and his father Henry Ford, it was originally funded by a $25,000 (about $550,000 in 2023) gift from Edsel Ford. By 1947, after the death of the two founders, the foundation owned 90% of the non-voting shares of the Ford Motor Company. (The Ford family retained the voting shares.) Between 1955 and 1974, the foundation sold its Ford Motor Company holdings and now plays no role in the automobile company.

In 1949, Henry Ford II created , a separate corporate foundation that to this day serves as the philanthropic arm of the Ford Motor Company and is not associated with the foundation.

The Ford Foundation makes grants through its headquarters and ten international field offices. For many years, the foundation&#x27;s financial endowment was the largest private endowment in the world; it remains among the wealthiest. For fiscal year 2014, it reported assets of $12.4 billion and approved $507.9 million in grants. According to the OECD, the Ford Foundation provided $194 million for development in 2019, all of which related to its grant-making activities.

== Mission ==

After its establishment in 1936, the Ford Foundation shifted its focus from Michigan philanthropic support to five areas of action. In the 1950 &quot;Report of the Study of the Ford Foundation on Policy and Program&quot;, the trustees set forth five &quot;areas of action,&quot; according to Richard Magat (2012): economic improvements, education, freedom and democracy, human behavior, and world peace. These areas of action were identified in a 1949 report by Horace Rowan Gaither.

Since the middle of the 20th century, many of the Ford Foundation&#x27;s programs have focused on increased under-represented or &quot;minority&quot; group representation in education, science and policy-making. For over eight decades their mission decisively advocates and supports the reduction of poverty and injustice among other values including the maintenance of democratic values, promoting engagement with other nations, and sustaining human progress and achievement at home and abroad.

The Ford Foundation is one of the primary foundations offering grants that support and maintain diversity in higher education with fellowships for pre-doctoral, dissertation, and post-doctoral scholarship to increase diverse representation among Native Americans, African Americans, Latin Americans, and other under-represented Asian and Latino sub-groups throughout the U.S. academic labor market. The outcomes of scholarship by its grantees from the late 20th century through the 21st century have contributed to substantial data and scholarship including national surveys such as the Nelson Diversity Surveys in STEM.

==History==

The foundation was established January 15, 1936, in Michigan by Edsel Ford (president of the Ford Motor Company) and two other executives &quot;to receive and administer funds for scientific, educational and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare.&quot; It was a reaction to FDR&#x27;s 1935 tax reform introducing 70% tax on large inheritances. During its early years, the foundation operated in Michigan under the leadership of Ford family members and their associates and supported the Henry Ford Hospital and the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village, among other organizations.

After the deaths of Edsel Ford in 1943 and Henry Ford in 1947, the presidency of the foundation fell to Edsel&#x27;s eldest son, Henry Ford II. It quickly became clear that the foundation would become the largest philanthropic organization in the world. The board of trustees then commissioned the Gaither Study Committee to chart the foundation&#x27;s future. The committee, headed by California attorney H. Rowan Gaither, recommended that the foundation become an international philanthropic organization dedicated to the advancement of human welfare and &quot;urged the foundation to focus on solving humankind&#x27;s most pressing problems, whatever they might be, rather than work in any particular field...&quot; The report was endorsed by the foundation&#x27;s board of trustees, and they subsequently voted to move the foundation to New York City in 1953. 

The board of directors decided to diversify the foundation&#x27;s portfolio and gradually divested itself of its substantial Ford Motor Company stock between 1955 and 1974. This divestiture allowed Ford Motor to become a public company. Finally, Henry Ford II resigned from his trustee&#x27;s role in a surprise move in December 1976. In his resignation letter, he cited his dissatisfaction with the foundation holding on to their old programs, large staff and what he saw as anti-capitalist undertones in the foundation&#x27;s work. In February 2019, Henry Ford III was elected to the Foundation&#x27;s Board of Trustees, becoming the first Ford family member to serve on the board since his grandfather resigned in 1976.

For many years, the foundation topped annual lists compiled by the Foundation Center of US foundations with the most assets and the highest annual giving. The foundation has fallen a few places in those lists in recent years, especially with the establishment of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000. As of May 4, 2013, the foundation was second in terms of assets and tenth in terms of annual grant giving.

=== Archives ===
In 2012, the foundation declared that it was not a research library and transferred its archives from New York City to the Rockefeller Archive Center in Sleepy Hollow, New York.

==Major grants and initiatives==

=== Media and public broadcasting ===
In 1951, the foundation made its first grant to support the development of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), then known as National Educational Television (NET), which went on the air in 1952. These grants continued, and in 1969 the foundation gave $1 million to the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop to help create and launch &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

=== Fund for Adult Education ===
Active from 1951 to 1961, this subsidiary of the Ford Foundation supported initiatives in the field of adult education, including educational television and public broadcasting. During its existence, the FAE spent over $47 million. Among its funding programs were a series of individual awards for people working in adult education to support training and field study experiences. The FAE also sponsored conferences on the topic of adult education, including the Bigwin Institute on Community Leadership in 1954 and the Mountain Plains Adult Education Conference in 1957. These conferences were open to academics, community organizers, and members of the public involved in the field of adult education.

In addition to grantmaking to organizations and projects, the FAE established its own programs, including the Test Cities Project and the Experimental Discussion Project. The Experimental Discussion Project produced media that was distributed to local organizations to conduct viewing or listening and discussion sessions. Topics covered included international affairs, world cultures, and United States history.

Educational theorist Robert Maynard Hutchins helped to found the FAE, and educational television advocate C. Scott Fletcher served as its president.

=== Arts and free speech ===
The foundation underwrote the Fund for the Republic in the 1950s. Throughout the 1950s, the foundation provided arts and humanities fellowships that supported the work of figures like Josef Albers, James Baldwin, Saul Bellow, Herbert Blau, E. E. Cummings, Anthony Hecht, Flannery O&#x27;Connor, Jacob Lawrence, Maurice Valency, Robert Lowell, and Margaret Mead. In 1961, Kofi Annan received an educational grant from the foundation to finish his studies at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota.

Under its &quot;Program for Playwrights&quot;, the foundation helped to support writers in professional regional theaters such as San Francisco&#x27;s Actor&#x27;s Workshop and offered similar help to Houston&#x27;s Alley Theatre and Washington&#x27;s Arena Stage.

=== Contraception ===
In the 1960s and 1970s, the foundation gave money to government and non-government contraceptive initiatives to support population control, peaking at an estimated $169 million in the last 1960s. The foundation ended most support for contraception programs by the 1970s.

The foundation remains supportive of access to abortion, granting funds to organizations that support reproductive rights.

=== Law school clinics and civil rights litigation ===
In 1968, the foundation began disbursing $12 million to persuade law schools to make &quot;law school clinics&quot; part of their curriculum. Clinics were intended to give practical experience in law practice while providing pro bono representation to the poor. Conservative critic Heather Mac Donald contends that the financial involvement of the foundation instead changed the clinics&#x27; focus from giving students practical experience to engaging in leftwing advocacy.

Beginning in the late 1960s and continuing through the 1970s, the foundation expanded into civil rights litigation, granting $18 million to civil rights litigation groups. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund was incorporated in 1967 with a $2.2 million grant from the foundation. In the same year, the foundation funded the establishment of the Southwest Council of La Raza, the predecessor of the National Council of La Raza. In 1972, the foundation provided a three-year $1.2 million grant to the Native American Rights Fund. The same year, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund opened with funding from numerous organizations, including the foundation. In 1974, the foundation contributed funds to the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project.

=== New York City public school decentralization ===
In 1967 and 1968, the foundation provided financial support for decentralization and community control of public schools in New York City. Decentralization in Ocean Hill–Brownsville led to the firing of some white teachers and administrators, which provoked a citywide teachers&#x27; strike led by the United Federation of Teachers.

=== Microcredit ===
In 1976, the foundation helped launch the Grameen Bank, which offers small loans to the rural poor of Bangladesh. The Grameen Bank and its founder Muhammad Yunus were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for pioneering microcredit.

=== In vitro fertilisation ===
Between 1969 and 1978, the foundation was the biggest funder for research into in vitro fertilisation in the United Kingdom, which led to the first baby, Louise Brown born from the technique. The Ford Foundation provided $1,170,194 towards the research.

=== Ford Foundation Fellowship Program ===
The foundation began awarding postdoctoral fellowships in 1980 to increase the diversity of the nation&#x27;s academic faculties. In 1986, the foundation added predoctoral and dissertation fellowships to the program. The foundation awards 130 to 140 fellowships annually, and there are 4,132 living fellows. The University of California, Berkeley was affiliated with 346 fellows at the time of award, the most of any institution, followed by the University of California, Los Angeles at 205, Harvard University at 191, Stanford University at 190, and Yale University at 175. The 10-campus University of California system accounts for 947 fellows, and the Ivy League is affiliated with 726. In 2022, the foundation announced that it would be sunsetting the program.

=== AIDS epidemic ===
In 1987, the foundation began making grants to fight the AIDS epidemic and in 2010 made grant disbursements totaling $29,512,312.

=== International leadership ===
In 2001, the foundation launched the International Fellowships Program (IFP) with a 12-year, $280 million grant, the largest in its history. IFP identified approximately 4,300 emerging social justice leaders representing historically disadvantaged groups from outside the United States for graduate study around the world. Fellows came from 22 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Russia and the Palestinian Territories and studied a wide variety of fields. After IFP&#x27;s early success with identifying candidates and selecting and placing Fellows, and the success of Fellows in completing their degrees, the foundation contributed an additional $75 million to IFP in 2006. IFP concluded operations in late 2013 when more than 80 percent of fellows had completed their studies. 
Fellows have been serving their home communities in a variety of ways involving social justice.

=== Israel ===
In April 2011, the foundation announced that it will cease its funding for programs in Israel as of 2013. It has provided $40 million to nongovernmental organizations in Israel since 2003 exclusively through the New Israel Fund (NIF), in the areas of advancing civil and human rights, helping Arab citizens in Israel gain equality and promoting Israeli-Palestinian peace. The grants from the foundation are roughly a third of NIF&#x27;s donor-advised giving, which totals about $15 million a year.

=== COVID-19 response ===
In June 2020, Ford Foundation decided to raise $1 billion through a combination of 30 and 50- year bonds. The main aim was to help nonprofits hit by the pandemic.

=== Disability Futures Fellows ===
In October 2020, Ford Foundation partnered with the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to establish the Disability Future Fellowship, awarding $50,000 annually to disabled writers, actors, and directors in the fields of creative arts performance. In 2022, another 20 Disability Futures Fellows received awards.

== Criticisms and reforms ==
=== Mission-related investments ===
Ranked No. 24 on the Forbes 2018 World&#x27;s Most Innovative Companies list, the Ford Foundation utilized its endowment to invest in innovative and sustainable change leadership shifting the model of grant-making in the 21st century. According to Forbes, &quot;Ford spends between $500 million and $550 million a year to support social justice work around the world. But last year, it also pledged to plow up to $1 billion of its overall $12.5 billion endowment over the next decade into impact investing via mission-related investments (MRIs) that generate both financial and social returns.&quot; Foundation President Darren Walker wrote in an op-ed in the New York Times that the grant-making philanthropy of institutions like the Ford Foundation &quot;must not only be generosity, but justice.&quot; The Ford Foundation seeks to address &quot;the underlying causes that perpetuate human suffering&quot; to grapple with and intervene in &quot;&quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot;&quot; inequality persists.

=== Native Arts and Culture Foundation endowment repatriation ===

In 2007, the Ford Foundation co-founded the independent Native Arts and Cultures Foundation by providing a portion of the new foundation&#x27;s endowment out of the Ford Foundation&#x27;s own. This decision to repatriate a portion of the Ford Foundation&#x27;s endowment came after self-initiated research into the Ford Foundation&#x27;s history of support of Native and Indigenous artists and communities. The results of this research indicated &quot;the inadequacy of philanthropic support for Native arts and artists&quot;, and related feedback from an unnamed Native leader that &quot;once big foundations put the stuff in place for an Indian program, then it is not usually funded very well. It lasts as long as the program officer who had an interest and then goes away&quot; and recommended that an independent endowment be established and that &quot;[n]ative leadership is crucial&quot;.

=== Relationship with the United States government ===
At the height of the Cold War, the Ford Foundation was involved in several covert operations. At least one of these involved the Fighting Group Against Inhumanity, a CIA-controlled group based in West Berlin that undertook various missions in the East Zone, including intelligence-gathering and sabotage. In 1950, the U.S. government sought to bolster the Fighting Group&#x27;s legitimacy as a credible independent organization, so the International Rescue Committee was recruited to act as its advocate. With the support of Eleanor Roosevelt, the Ford Foundation was persuaded to give the Fighting Group a grant of $150,000. A press release announcing the grant pointed to the assistance given by the Fighting Group to &quot;carefully screened&quot; defectors to come to the West. The National Committee for a Free Europe, a CIA proprietary, actually administered the grant.

From 1958 to 1965, the Foundation&#x27;s chairman was John J. McCloy, who in 1942 had founded the Office of Strategic Services, a secretive intelligence agency that would become the Central Intelligence Agency. McCloy knowingly employed numerous US intelligence agents and, based on the premise that a relationship with the CIA was inevitable, set up a three-person committee responsible for dealing with its requests. The CIA channeled funds through Ford Foundation as a part of its efforts to influence culture. 

Writer and activist Arundhati Roy has said that the foundation, along with the Rockefeller Foundation, supported imperialist efforts by the U.S. government during the Cold War. For example, Roy wrote that the Ford Foundation&#x27;s establishment of an economics course at the Indonesian University helped align students with the 1965 coup that installed Suharto as president.

=== Gender roles and feminist theory ===
American author, philosopher, and critic of feminism Christina Hoff Sommers, criticized The Ford Foundation in her book &quot;The War Against Boys&quot; (2000) as well as other institutions in education and government. Sommers alleged that the Ford Foundation funded feminist ideologies that marginalize boys and men. A Washington Post book review by E. Anthony Rotundo, author of &quot;American Manhood: Transformations in Masculinity from the Revolution to the Modern Era&quot;, alleges that Sommers &quot;persistently misrepresents scholarly debate, [and] ignores evidence that contradicts her assertions&quot; about a gender war against boys and men. Spanish judge Francisco Serrano Castro made similar claims to Sommers in his 2012 book &quot;The Dictatorship of Gender&quot;.

=== Criteria for Palestinian grantmaking ===
In 2003, the foundation was critiqued by US news service Jewish Telegraphic Agency, among others, for supporting Palestinian nongovernmental organizations that were accused of promoting antisemitism at the 2001 World Conference Against Racism. Under pressure by several members of Congress, chief among them Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the foundation apologized and then prohibited the promotion of &quot;violence, terrorism, bigotry or the destruction of any state&quot; among its grantees. This move itself sparked protest among university provosts and various non-profit groups on free speech issues.

The foundation&#x27;s partnership with the New Israel Fund (NIF), which began in 2003, was criticized regarding its choice of mostly progressive grantees and causes. This criticism peaked after the 2001 World Conference Against Racism, where some nongovernmental organizations funded by the foundation backed resolutions equating Israeli policies with apartheid. In response, the Ford Foundation tightened its criteria for funding. In 2011, right wing Israeli politicians and organizations such as NGO Monitor and Im Tirtzu claimed the NIF and other recipients of Ford Foundation grants supported the delegitimization of Israel.

The Ford Foundation announced in October 2023 that it would no longer provide grants to Alliance for Global Justice, a charity in Arizona claimed by journalist Gabe Kaminsky in a &quot;Washington Examiner&quot; investigation to share Palestinian terrorism ties. &quot;Ford has no plans to support any Alliance for Global Justice projects in the future and it is not eligible for any other funding,&quot; Amanda Simon, a spokeswoman for the Ford Foundation, said at the time. Simon added, &quot;We will not be funding them in the future.&quot; 

The allegations of terrorism links were proven false; Alliance for Global Justice was found to be funding an organisation that attempts to secure the human rights of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. 

== Ford Foundation Center for Social Justice ==

Completed in 1968 by the firm of Roche-Dinkeloo, the Ford Foundation Center for Social Justice in New York City (originally the Ford Foundation Building) was the first large-scale architectural building in the country to devote a substantial portion of its space to horticultural pursuits. Its atrium was designed with the notion of having urban greenspace accessible to all and is an example of the application in architecture of environmental psychology. The building, 321 E. 42nd St., was recognized in 1968 by the Architectural Record as &quot;a new kind of urban space&quot;. This design concept was used by others for many of the indoor shopping malls and skyscrapers built in subsequent decades. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building a landmark in 1997.
