<text>In the myth and religion of ancient Rome, Juturna, or Diuturna, was a goddess of fountains, wells and springs, and the mother of Fontus by Janus.

==Mythology==
Juturna was an ancient Latin deity of fountains, who in some myths was turned by Jupiter into a water nymph – a Naiad – and given by him a sacred well in Lavinium, Latium, as well as another one near the temple to Vesta in the Forum Romanum. Her original home was said to be on the mythological river Numicius.
The pool next to the second well in the Roman Forum (Rome) was called Lacus Juturnae. A local water nymph or river-god generally presides over a single body of water, but Juturna has broader powers which probably reflect her original importance in Latium, where she had temples in Rome and Lavinium, a cult of healthful waters at Ardea, and the fountain/well next to the lake in the Roman forum. It was here in Roman legend that the deities Castor and Pollux watered their horses after bringing news of the Roman victory at the Battle of Lake Regillus in 496 BC (Valerius Maximus, I.8.1; Plutarch, Life of Aemilius Paulus, 25.2, Life of Coriolanus, 3.4).

A temple was erected in her honour after the first Punic war.

==In literature==
*Virgil makes her a sister of Turnus who supported him against Aeneas by giving him his sword after he dropped it in battle, as well as by taking him away from the battle when it seemed he would be killed. In the end, however, she could not save him from his fate, and retreated into her waters in mourning. Juturna is further hellenized by Juno’s conferral of catasterism (Aen. 12.143, 145), an act that links her with the Dioscuri. These divinities all share a similar function as helpers of mortals and had traditional cultic connections in early Latium.
*Ovid relates her affair with Jupiter (Greek Zeus): the secret was betrayed by another nymph, Larunda, whom Jupiter struck with muteness as punishment.

==Cult==
Holloway has argued that the goddess shown carrying a winged helmet on early Roman coinage is Juturna, but her iconography is largely unknown. A later altar relief from the Temple of Castor and Pollux in the Roman Forum may depict her. A Roman festival was held in her honor on January 11, when she was given sacrifices and honored by the &quot;fontani&quot; (the men who maintained the fountains and aqueducts of Rome).

==Honours==

Juturna Lake in Antarctica is named after the deity.

<doc id="85317" wikidata="Q5088040" url="?curid=85317" title="Chaucer College">
<text>Chaucer College Canterbury is an independent college for Japanese university and high school students. It was founded in 1992 by Hiroshi Kawashima, the head of the Shumei Foundation, and opened on 13 October 1992, and is located in a prize-winning building featuring a combination of western and oriental architectural styles on the campus of the University of Kent at Canterbury. All students are recruited by the Shumei Foundation, and many are drawn from its educational establishments in Japan, consisting of a small private university and three very successful independent high schools (Shumei Kawagoe, Shumei Eiko, Shumei Yachiyo). The college now also offers English language courses for European and international students. This is in keeping with the founding principles that &#x27;World peace in both political and economic spheres depends upon international exchange and understanding&#x27;.

== History ==
The college was founded in 1992 by Hiroshi Kawashima, the head of the Shumei Foundation.

== Campus ==
Chaucer College, as a purpose-built academic institution and self-contained campus, contains over 200 single study bedrooms, leisure facilities (student common room, games and music areas, an &quot;English Room&quot;), full catering facilities, a large, well-equipped lecture theatre, an excellent Library and a score of classrooms. Kingsgate College has similar teaching, catering and leisure facilities (although no lecture theatre) and 30 bedrooms (a mixture of singles, doubles and triples).

== Organisation and administration ==
The college&#x27;s senior management team consists of the chancellor, the director of academic programmes, the dean of students, the college manager, and the facilities manager. There is a full complement of well-qualified academic staff, all of whom have university degrees, and many of whom hold higher qualifications. Most are highly experienced and qualified in the teaching of English as a second language.

The college also employs British university students either from the University of Kent or from Canterbury Christ Church University as conversation teachers. Students from Dartford Grammar School are also employed there as they have a pact of friendship with Shumei University. Their role is to socialise with the college&#x27;s students by offering one-to-one conversation classes to enhance fluency in spoken English and to introduce them to various aspects of British society, typically through their own cultural and sporting interest groups. In exchange for the service they provide, conversation teachers receive free board and lodging at Chaucer College. They are expected to conform to the college&#x27;s rules, which can appear to be quite stringent (it should, however, be noted that young people in Japan are not legally adults until the age of 20).

== Academic profile ==
The group follows the Japanese academic year, running from April to February. During the first semester, Chaucer College welcomes Shumei University first-year students from four faculties:

* The Faculty of Management and Administration
* The Faculty of English &amp; Information Technology
* The Faculty of Tourism and Business
* The Faculty of Teacher Education (English major)

Their programme consists of a combination of intensive study of the English language, combined with preparatory work on the subjects that will form the major component of their Shumei University degree. Teacher Education students also undertake a programme of visits to local partner schools to observe UK teaching methods. Students reside in the purpose-built accommodation on the Chaucer campus, but most include a period of homestay with a local family in their programme.

During the second semester, Chaucer, like Kingsgate, welcomes successive contingents of Shumei High School students visiting the UK. Junior high school students (age 14–15) come for two weeks, senior high school students (age 16–17) for four weeks. The latter also include a period of homestay in their programme.

During the Japanese university vacation (February–April), Chaucer hosts a four-week vacation programme for Shumei Teacher Education Faculty students whose major is not English. During this course, the students have the opportunity to visit both local and continental schools (France and Germany).

In a new venture, the college uses its considerable expertise to offer a variety of English language courses to individuals and groups seeking to improve their English and develop international exchanges at both its campuses. Courses currently last from between one and four weeks.

== Student life ==
The Chaucer College group is a registered charity. The Charities Act (2006) stipulates that registered charities should demonstrate &quot;public benefit&quot;. In accordance with this expectation, the college&#x27;s students engage in a variety of activities, including participation in local cultural festivals and an extensive community volunteering programme. Open Days or Open Evenings are held regularly, and the colleges also offer accommodation and conference facilities to other local organisations. Students also visit local schools as &quot;cultural ambassadors&quot; for Japan and vice versa.

<doc id="85318" wikidata="Q582918" url="?curid=85318" title="Fontus">
<text>Fontus or Fons (: &quot;Fontes&quot;, &quot;Font&quot; or &quot;Source&quot;) was a god of wells and springs in ancient Roman religion. A religious festival called the Fontinalia was held on October 13 in his honor. Throughout the city, fountains and wellheads were adorned with garlands.

Fontus was the son of Juturna and Janus. Numa Pompilius, second king of Rome, was supposed to have been buried near the altar of Fontus &quot;(ara Fontis)&quot; on the Janiculum. William Warde Fowler observed that between 259 and 241 BC, cults were founded for Juturna, Fons, and the Tempestates, all having to do with sources of water. As a god of pure water, Fons can be placed in opposition to Liber as a god of wine identified with Bacchus.

An inscription includes Fons among a series of deities who received expiatory sacrifices by the Arval Brothers in 224 AD, when several trees in the sacred grove of Dea Dia, their chief deity, had been struck by lightning and burnt. Fons received two . Fons was not among the deities depicted on coinage of the Roman Republic.

The gens Fonteia claimed to be Fontus&#x27; descendants.

In the cosmological schema of Martianus Capella, Fons is located in the second of 16 celestial regions, with Jupiter, Quirinus, Mars, the Military Lar, Juno, Lympha, and the Novensiles.

==Fons Perennis==
Water as a source of regeneration played a role in the Mithraic mysteries, and inscriptions to &quot;Fons Perennis&quot; (&quot;Eternal Spring&quot; or &quot;Never-Failing Stream&quot;) have been found in mithraea. In one of the scenes of the Mithraic cycle, the god strikes a rock, which then gushes water. A Mithraic text explains that the stream was a source of life-giving water and immortal refreshment. Dedications to &quot;inanimate entities&quot; from Mithraic narrative ritual, such as &quot;Fons Perennis&quot; and &quot;Petra Genetrix&quot; (&quot;Generative Rock&quot;), treat them as divine and capable of hearing, like the nymphs and healing powers to whom these are more often made.

==Honours==
Fontus Lake in Antarctica is named after the deity.

<doc id="85320" wikidata="Q945934" url="?curid=85320" title="Gravy">
<text>Gravy is a sauce made from the juices of meats and vegetables that run naturally during cooking and often thickened with thickeners for added texture. The gravy may be further coloured and flavoured with gravy salt (a mix of salt and caramel food colouring) or gravy browning (gravy salt dissolved in water) or bouillon cubes. Powders can be used as a substitute for natural meat or vegetable extracts. Canned and instant gravies are also available. Gravy is commonly served with roasts, meatloaf, rice, noodles, fries (chips), mashed potatoes, or biscuits (North America, see biscuits and gravy).

== History ==
Based on current understanding of what a gravy is at its core (a sauce made from meat drippings combined with a thickening agent), one of the earliest recorded instances of a gravy being used is from &quot;The Forme of Cury,&quot; a cookbook from the 14th century. The term &quot;gravy&quot; is believed to be derived from the French word &quot;gravé&quot; that is found in many medieval French cookbooks.

==Types==

: &quot;See also &quot;
* Brown gravy is the name for a gravy made from the drippings from roasted meat or fowl. The drippings are cooked on the stovetop at high heat with onions or other vegetables, and then thickened with a thin mixture of water and either wheat flour or cornstarch.
* Cream gravy, or white gravy (sawmill gravy) is a bechamel sauce made using fats from meat—such as sausage or bacon—or meat drippings from roasting or frying meats. The fat and drippings are combined with flour to make a roux, and milk is typically used as the liquid to create the sauce, however, cream is often added or may be the primary liquid. It is frequently seasoned with black pepper, and complementing herbs and bits of meat may be added such as sausage or diced chicken liver. It is an important part of many Southern USA meals, and frequently used as an ingredient in casseroles and other southern dishes, such as biscuits and gravy and served alongside many Southern favorites such as mashed potatoes, fried chicken and chicken-fried steak. Other common names include country gravy, sawmill gravy, milk gravy, and sausage gravy.
* Egg gravy is a variety of gravy made starting with meat drippings (usually from bacon) followed by flour being used to make a thick roux. Water, broth, or milk is added and the liquid is brought back up to a boil, then salt and peppered to taste. A well-beaten egg is then slowly added while the gravy is stirred or whisked swiftly, cooking the egg immediately and separating it into small fragments in the gravy.
* Red gravy can refer to several different dishes. It is a simple, basic tomato sauce in New Orleans. In the Italian American communities it refers to a complex long- and slow-cooked tomato sauce, frequently with meats and vegetables, although the distinction between &quot;sauce&quot; and &quot;gravy&quot; in the Italian tomato world is debated. There are several red gravies from India, which are variations of tomato-based curry.
* Giblet gravy has the giblets of turkey or chicken added when it is to be served with those types of poultry, or uses stock made from the giblets.
* Mushroom gravy is a variety of gravy made with mushrooms.
* Onion gravy is made from large quantities of slowly sweated, chopped onions mixed with stock or wine. It is commonly served with bangers and mash, eggs, chops, or other grilled or fried meat which by way of the cooking method would not produce their own gravy.
* Red-eye gravy is a gravy made from the drippings of ham fried in a skillet or frying pan. The pan is deglazed with coffee, giving the gravy its name, and uses no thickening agent. This gravy is a staple of Southern United States cuisine and is usually served over ham, grits or biscuits.
* Vegetable gravy or vegetarian gravy is gravy made with boiled or roasted vegetables. A quick and flavourful vegetable gravy can be made from any combination of vegetable broth or vegetable stock, flour, and one of either butter, oil, or margarine. One recipe uses vegetarian bouillon cubes with cornstarch (corn flour) as a thickener (&quot;cowboy roux&quot;), which is whisked into boiling water. Sometimes vegetable juices are added to enrich the flavour, which may give the gravy a dark green colour. Wine could be added. Brown vegetarian gravy can also be made with savoury yeast extract like Marmite or Vegemite. There are also commercially produced instant gravy granules which are suitable for both vegetarians and vegans, though some of the leading brands are not marketed as being vegetarian.

==Cuisines==


In the United Kingdom and Ireland, a Sunday roast is usually served with gravy. It is commonly eaten with beef, pork, chicken or lamb. It is also popular in different parts of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland to have gravy with just chips (mostly from a fish and chip shop or Chinese takeaway).

In British and Irish cuisine, as well as in the cuisines of Commonwealth countries like Australia, Canada and New Zealand, the word gravy refers only to the meat-based sauce derived from meat juices, stock cubes or gravy granules. Use of the word &quot;gravy&quot; does not include other thickened sauces. One of the most popular forms is onion gravy, which is eaten with sausages, Yorkshire pudding and roast meat.

Throughout the United States, gravy is commonly eaten with Thanksgiving foods such as turkey, mashed potatoes and stuffing. One Southern United States variation is sausage gravy eaten with American biscuits. Another Southern US dish that uses white gravy is chicken-fried steak. Rice and gravy is a staple of Cajun and Creole cuisine in the southern US state of Louisiana.

Gravy is an integral part of the Canadian dish poutine. In Quebec, poutine gravy is thin, and is sometimes a mix of beef and chicken stock. Other places in Canada use a thicker gravy, similar to an American gravy.

In some parts of Asia, particularly India, gravy is any thickened liquid part of a dish. For example, the liquid part of a thick curry may be referred to as gravy.

In the Mediterranean, Maghreb cuisine is dominated with gravy and bread-based dishes. Tajine and most Maghreb (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia) dishes are derivatives of oil, meat and vegetable gravies. The dish is usually served with a loaf of bread. The bread is then dipped into the gravy and then used to gather or scoop the meat and vegetables between the index, middle finger and thumb, and consumed.

In gastronomy of Menorca, it has been used since the English influence during the 17th century in typical Menorcan and Catalan dishes, as for example &quot;macarrons amb grevi&quot; (pasta).

<text>Toon Disney was an American multinational pay television channel owned by Disney Branded Television, a subsidiary of Disney-ABC Television Group. The channel&#x27;s target audience was children aged 7–11, and older children and adolescents aged 8–15 during the Jetix programming block.

A spin-off of Disney Channel, the channel&#x27;s programming mostly included animated series, shorts, and features from Disney, as well as acquired programs.

==History==
Toon Disney was launched on April 18, 1998, at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time, in honor of Disney Channel&#x27;s 15th anniversary by Disney Channel, Inc. on digital tiers of DirecTV, Marcus Cable, and EchoStar. The first program to air on the network was &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (1940). At 7:00 p.m. ET that day, Toon Disney launched a block called &quot;The Magical World of Toons&quot;. The block originally featured Disney animated features, specials, and shorts. Over the next five months, Toon Disney furthered its programming to cable subscribers such as Americast. At its launch, the channel shared half of its assigned series with Disney Channel. The channel had no advertising until its viewership reached a set number. On January 31, 1999, the first annual Pumbaa Bowl marathon was broadcast.

By September 2000, the channel was expected to reach 20 million subscribers, and thus, would start showing advertising. Ad sales would be handled by Disney Kids Network.

In June 2001, Toon Disney launched the &quot;Most Animated Kid Search&quot;. In September 2002, eight new shows joined the line-up as part of Toon Disney&#x27;s fall schedule. In commemoration of the network&#x27;s fifth anniversary in April 2003, the channel held the &quot;Toon Disney&#x27;s Magical Adventure Sweepstakes&quot; in which three winners along with 3 family members would win a trip to Disneyland Resort to see &quot;Disney&#x27;s Aladdin: A Musical Spectacular&quot;.

On February 14, 2004, the Jetix programming block began on Toon Disney and ABC Family as a part of the Jetix programming alliance of ABC Networks Group, Fox Kids Europe, and Fox Kids Latin America. The block consisted of the entire acquired Fox Kids/Saban Entertainment action library as the result of a bulk buy-out by The Walt Disney Company in the summer of 2001, as well as some original programming. Some shows, like &quot;The Legend of Tarzan&quot;, and &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot; aired under both the Toon Disney and Jetix monikers.

The Toon Disney/Big Movie Show premiere of &quot;The Polar Express&quot; on December 22, 2006, was the channel&#x27;s highest primetime rating with 1.35 million viewers. On January 27, 2007, Toon Disney launched its weekend afternoon programming block, &quot;The Great Toon Weekend.&quot;

On August 6, 2008, Disney-ABC Television Group announced they would rebrand Toon Disney in early 2009 as Disney XD, which would be aimed at kids from ages 6 and up. The final pre-Disney XD program to air on the channel was &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; episode &quot;Doomed&quot; at 11:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, February 12, 2009, as part of Jetix, while the first Disney XD program was the &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; episode &quot;Dude, We&#x27;re Getting the Band Back Together&quot; on Friday, February 13, 2009, at midnight ET.

In 2005, a Toon Disney channel was launched for the Nordic countries, and another one for Japan. A Hindi-language audio track was introduced on Toon Disney in India on September 1, 2005. After the shutdown of the US channel, the remaining channels &amp; blocks with the Toon Disney name outside the US were relaunched as either Disney Cinemagic (in European countries only), Disney Channel, or Disney XD, with the last Toon Disney-branded channels to close being the 2 Italian channels on October 1, 2011.

<text>Furrina, also spelled Furina, was an ancient Roman goddess whose function had become obscure by the 1st century BC. Her cult dated to the earliest period of Roman religious history, since she was one of the fifteen deities who had their own flamen, the &quot;Furrinalis&quot;, one of the &quot;flamines minores&quot;. There is some evidence that Furrina was associated with water.

==Etymology==
Furrina was a goddess of springs. According to Georges Dumézil, her name was related to the moving or bubbling of water. It is cognate with Gothic &quot;brunna&quot; (&quot;spring&quot;), Latin &quot;fervēre&quot;, from *fruur &gt; furr by metathesis of the vowel, meaning to bubble or boil. Compare English &quot;fervent&quot;, &quot;effervescent&quot;, and Latin &quot;defruutum&quot; (&quot;boiled wine&quot;).

==Religious sites==
She had a sacred spring and a shrine in Rome, located on the southwestern slopes of Mount Janiculum, on the right bank of the Tiber. The site has survived to the present day in the form of a grove, included within the gardens of Villa Sciarra. Excavations on the site conducted in 1910 identified a well and a system of underground channels, as well as some inscriptions dedicated to &quot;Jupiter Optimus Maximus Heliopolitanus&quot;, &quot;Agatis&quot;, and the &quot;nymphae furrinae&quot;. However, these findings look to be of a later date (2nd century CE) and perhaps the well is not the original spring.

Gaius Gracchus was killed in the Grove of Furrina.

According to Cicero, another sanctuary dedicated to the cult of Furrina was located near Satricum. This place was not the most widely known one, but a hamlet near Arpinum was.

==Festival==
Furrina&#x27;s festival was the Furrinalia, held on July 25. On the Roman calendar, festivals separated by an interval of three days were interconnected and belonged to the same function. In the second half of July, the two Lucaria occur on the 19th and 17th, with the Neptunalia on the 23rd and the Furrinalia on the 25th. This grouping is devoted to woods and running waters, which are intended as shelter and relief from the heat of the season, the &quot;canicula&quot;.

Furrina is a low ranking deity who has her seat just above the mountain peaks.

<text>In science and engineering the study of high pressure examines its effects on materials and the design and construction of devices, such as a diamond anvil cell, which can create high pressure. &quot;High pressure&quot; usually means pressures of thousands (kilobars) or millions (megabars) of times atmospheric pressure (about 1 bar or 100,000 Pa).

==History and overview==
Percy Williams Bridgman received a Nobel Prize in 1946 for advancing this area of physics by two magnitudes of pressure (400 MPa to 40 GPa). The list of founding fathers of this field includes also the names of Harry George Drickamer, Tracy Hall, Francis P. Bundy, , and .

It was by applying high pressure as well as high temperature to carbon that synthetic diamonds were first produced alongside many other interesting discoveries. Almost any material when subjected to high pressure will compact itself into a denser form, for example, quartz (also called silica or silicon dioxide) will first adopt a denser form known as coesite, then upon application of even higher pressure, form stishovite. These two forms of silica were first discovered by high-pressure experimenters, but then found in nature at the site of a meteor impact.

Chemical bonding is likely to change under high pressure, when the P*V term in the free energy becomes comparable to the energies of typical chemical bonds – i.e. at around 100 GPa. Among the most striking changes are metallization of oxygen at 96 GPa (rendering oxygen a superconductor), and transition of sodium from a nearly-free-electron metal to a transparent insulator at ~200 GPa. At ultimately high compression, however, all materials will metallize.

High-pressure experimentation has led to the discovery of the types of minerals which are believed to exist in the deep mantle of the Earth, such as silicate perovskite, which is thought to make up half of the Earth&#x27;s bulk, and post-perovskite, which occurs at the core-mantle boundary and explains many anomalies inferred for that region.

Pressure &quot;landmarks&quot;: typical pressures reached by large-volume presses are up to 30–40 GPa, pressures that can be generated inside diamond anvil cells are ~1000 GPa, pressure in the center of the Earth is 364 GPa, and highest pressures ever achieved in shock waves are over 100,000 GPa.

<doc id="85332" wikidata="Q47512572" url="?curid=85332" title="Man page">
<text>A man page (short for manual page) is a form of software documentation found on Unix and Unix-like operating systems. Topics covered include programs, system libraries, system calls, and sometimes local system details. The local host administrators can create and install manual pages associated with the specific host. A manual end user may invoke a documentation page by issuing the codice_1 command followed by the specific detail they require. These manual pages are typically requested by end users, programmers and administrators doing real time work but can also be formatted for printing.

By default, codice_1 typically uses a formatting program such as codice_3 with a macro and also a terminal pager program such as codice_4 or codice_5 to display its output on the users screen.

Man pages are often referred to as an &quot;online&quot; form of software documentation, even though the codice_1 command does not require internet access. The environment variable MANPATH often specifies a list of directory paths to search for the various documentation pages. Manual pages date back to the times when printed documentation was the norm.

==History==

Before Unix (e.g., GCOS), documentation was printed pages, available on the premises to users (staff, students...), organized into steel binders, locked together in one monolithic steel reading rack, bolted to a table or counter, with pages organized for modular information updates, replacement, errata, and addenda. 

In the first two years of the history of Unix, no documentation existed. The &quot;Unix Programmer&#x27;s Manual&quot; was first published on November 3, 1971. The first actual man pages were written by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson at the insistence of their manager Doug McIlroy in 1971. Aside from the man pages, the &quot;Programmer&#x27;s Manual&quot; also accumulated a set of short papers, some of them tutorials (e.g. for general Unix usage, the C programming language, and tools such as Yacc), and others more detailed descriptions of operating system features. The printed version of the manual initially fit into a single binder, but as of PWB/UNIX and the 7th Edition of Research Unix, it was split into two volumes with the printed man pages forming Volume 1.

Later versions of the documentation imitated the first man pages&#x27; terseness. Ritchie added a &quot;How to get started&quot; section to the Third Edition introduction, and Lorinda Cherry provided the &quot;Purple Card&quot; pocket reference for the Sixth and Seventh Editions. Versions of the software were named after the revision of the manual; the seventh edition of the &quot;Unix Programmer&#x27;s Manual&quot;, for example, came with the 7th Edition or Version 7 of Unix.

For the Fourth Edition the man pages were formatted using the troff typesetting package and its set of codice_7 macros (which were completely revised between the Sixth and Seventh Editions of the &quot;Manual&quot;, but have since not drastically changed). At the time, the availability of online documentation through the manual page system was regarded as a great advance. To this day, virtually every Unix command line application comes with a man page, and many Unix users perceive a program&#x27;s lack of man pages as a sign of low quality or incompleteness. Indeed, some projects, such as Debian, go out of their way to write man pages for programs lacking one. The modern descendants of 4.4BSD also distribute man pages as one of the primary forms of system documentation (having replaced the old codice_7 macros with the newer codice_9).

There was a hidden Easter egg in the man-db version of the man command that would cause the command to return &quot;gimme gimme gimme&quot; when run at 00:30 (a reference to the ABBA song Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight). It was introduced in 2011 but first restricted and then removed in 2017 after finally being found.

== Formatting ==

The default format of man pages is troff, with either the macro package man (appearance oriented) or mdoc (semantic oriented). This makes it possible to typeset a man page into PostScript, PDF, and various other formats for viewing or printing.

Some Unix systems have a package for the command, which enables users to browse their man pages using an HTML browser. Systems with groff and man-db should use the higher-quality native HTML output () instead.
The GNU Emacs program &quot;WoMan&quot; (from &quot;WithOut man&quot;) allows to browse man pages from the editor.

In 2010, OpenBSD deprecated troff for formatting man pages in favour of mandoc, a specialised compiler/formatter for man pages with native support for output in PostScript, HTML, XHTML, and the terminal. It is meant to only support a subset of troff used in manual pages, specifically those using mdoc macros.

=== Online services ===
Quite a few websites offer online access to manual pages from various Unix-like systems.

In February 2013, the BSD community saw a new open source mdoc.su service launched, which unified and shortened access to the man.cgi scripts of the major modern BSD projects through a unique nginx-based deterministic URL shortening service for the *BSD man pages.

For Linux, a man7.org service has been set up to serve manuals specific to the system. A ManKier service provides a wider selection, and integrates the TLDR pages too.

==Command usage==
To read a manual page for a Unix command, a user can type:

man &lt;command_name&gt;
Pages are traditionally referred to using the notation &quot;name(section)&quot;: for example, . The section refers to different ways the topic might be referenced - for example, as a system call, or a shell (command line) command or package, or a package&#x27;s configuration file, or as a coding construct / header.

The same page name may appear in more than one section of the manual, such as when the names of system calls, user commands, or macro packages coincide. Examples are and , or and . The syntax for accessing the non-default manual section varies between different man implementations. 

On Solaris and illumos, for example, the syntax for reading is:

man -s 3c printf

On Linux and BSD derivatives the same invocation would be:

man 3 printf
which searches for &quot;printf&quot; in section 3 of the man pages. The actual file name likely includes the section. Continuing this example, printf.3.gz would be a compressed manual page file in section 3 for &quot;printf&quot;.

==Manual sections==
The manual is generally split into eight numbered sections. Most systems today (e.g. BSD, macOS, Linux, and Solaris 11.4) inherit the numbering scheme used by Research Unix. While System V uses a different order:
POSIX APIs are present in both sections 2 and 3, where section 2 contains APIs that are implemented as system calls and section 3 contains APIs that are implemented as library routines.

On some systems, additional sections may be included such as:
Some sections are further subdivided by means of a suffix; for example, in some systems, section 3C is for C library calls, 3M is for the math library, and so on. A consequence of this is that section 8 (system administration commands) is sometimes relegated to the 1M subsection of the main commands section. Some subsection suffixes have a general meaning across sections:

(Section 3 tends to be the exception with the many suffixes for different languages.)

Some versions of codice_1 cache the formatted versions of the last several pages viewed. One form is the &quot;cat page&quot;, simply piped to the pager for display.

==Layout==
All man pages follow a common layout that is optimized for presentation on a simple ASCII text display, possibly without any form of highlighting or font control. Sections present may include:
; NAME: The name of the command or function, followed by a one-line description of what it does.
; SYNOPSIS: In the case of a command, a formal description of how to run it and what command line options it takes. For program functions, a list of the parameters the function takes and which header file contains its declaration.
; DESCRIPTION: A textual description of the functioning of the command or function. For programs, this section often includes explanations of available command line options.
; EXAMPLES: Some examples of common usage.
; SEE ALSO: A list of related commands or functions.

Other sections may be present, but these are not well standardized across man pages. Common examples include: OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE, ENVIRONMENT, BUGS, FILES, AUTHOR, REPORTING BUGS, HISTORY and COPYRIGHT.

==Authoring==
Manual pages can be written either in the old macros, the new macros, or a combination of both (). The macro set provides minimal rich text functions, with directives for the title line, section headers, (bold, small or italic) fonts, paragraphs and adding/reducing indentation. The newer language is more semantic in nature, and contains specialized macros for most standard sections such as program name, synopsis, function names, and the name of the authors. This information can be used to implement a semantic search for manuals by programs such as mandoc. Although it also includes directives to directly control the styling, it is expected that the specialized macros will cover most of the use-cases. Both the mandoc and the groff projects consider the preferred format for new documents.

Although man pages are, to troff, text laid out using 10-point Roman type, this distinction is usually moot because man pages are viewed in the terminal (TTY) instead of laid out on paper. As a result, the &quot;small font&quot; macro is seldom used. On the other hand, bold and italic text is supported by the terminal via ECMA-48, and groff&#x27;s does emit them as requested when it detects a supporting terminal. The BSD mandoc however only supports bold and underlined (as a replacement for italics) text via the typewriter backspace-then-overstrike sequence, which needs to be translated into ECMA-48 by .

Some tools have been used to convert documents in a less contrived format to manual pages. Examples include GNU&#x27;s , which takes a output and some additional content to generate a manual page. The manual would be barely more useful than the said output, but for GNU programs this is not an issue as texinfo is the main documentation system. A number of tools, including pandoc, ronn, and md2man support conversion from Markdown to manual pages. All these tools emit the format, as Markdown is not expressive enough to match the semantic content of . DocBook has an inbuilt man(7) converter – of appalling quality, according to mandoc&#x27;s author who wrote a separate mdoc(7) converter.

Man pages are usually written in English, but translations into other languages may be available on the system. The GNU and the mandoc is known to search for localized manual pages under subdirectories.

=== Alternatives ===
Few alternatives to codice_1 have enjoyed much popularity, with the possible exception of GNU Project&#x27;s &quot;codice_12&quot; system, an early and simple hypertext system. There is also a third-party effort known as TLDR pages (codice_13) that provides simple examples for common use cases, similar to a cheatsheet.

In addition, some Unix GUI applications (particularly those built using the GNOME and KDE development environments) now provide end-user documentation in HTML and include embedded HTML viewers such as codice_14 for reading the help within the application. An HTML system in Emacs is also slated to replace texinfo.

<text>The Baloncesto Superior Nacional, abbreviated as BSN, is the first-tier-level professional men&#x27;s basketball league in Puerto Rico. It was founded in 1929 and is organized by the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation.

The Baloncesto Superior Nacional, which is played under FIBA rules, currently consists of 12
teams, of which the most successful has been the Vaqueros de Bayamón with 16 titles as of 2022. 

The league has produced players that have distinguished themselves in the NBA, EuroLeague, Spain&#x27;s ACB, and other tournaments throughout the world. Among them, Georgie Torres was the first Puerto Rican to sign an NBA contract &amp; Butch Lee was the first BSN player to win an NBA title. Later on players including José Ortiz, Ramón Rivas, Daniel Santiago, Carlos Arroyo and J. J. Barea, started their careers playing for BSN teams and later played in the NBA.

==Competition format== 
BSN games are played under the regular FIBA basketball rules. The twelve teams each play a total of four games amongst themselves, two at home and two away, for a total of 44 games during the regular season. Of the 12 participating teams, the top 8 move on to the postseason. The final two teams left will play in the &quot;La Final Brava&quot;, or the Brava Final, a basketball tournament sponsored by Brava Lubricants.

==History==
The league began in 1930, and is noted for having had several head coaches who went on to achieve international recognition later in their careers. Among those are Basketball Hall of Fame members Dr. Jack Ramsay, Tex Winter and Red Holzman, who coached the Leones de Ponce in the 1950s and 1960s, and Phil Jackson, who coached the Piratas de Quebradillas and Gallitos de Isabela in the late 1980s. Others notable coaches who have worked for BSN teams include Gene Bartow, Lou Rossini, Del Harris, P. J. Carlesimo, Bernie Bickerstaff, Herb Brown and Sergio Hernández.

During the 1980s, notable players followed in the footsteps of players such as Juan &quot;Pachin&quot; Vicens (1959 Santiago Chile FIBA World Championship&#x27;s All-Tournament Team) and Butch Lee, the first Puerto Rican and BSN player to enter the NBA. Among those are: Mario &#x27;Quijote&#x27; Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Jose &#x27;Piculin&#x27; Ortiz, Ramón Rivas, Jerome Mincy, Georgie Torres, Angelo Cruz, Angel Santiago, the late Federico &#x27;Fico&#x27; Lopez, Rolando Frazer, Mario Butler, and Rubén Rodríguez, who showcased their talents to all of Puerto Rico&#x27;s TV viewers and game goers.
===New Era and Renewed Interest (2019-present)===
On September 19, 2019, the BSN team owners selected Ricardo Dalmau Santana to succeed Fernando Quiñones Bodea as president of the league.

In October 2020, there was a change in ownership of the Vaqueros de Bayamón, when retired professional baseball player Yadier Molina acquired his hometown team. In April 2021, the league approved the return of the Cangrejeros under the ownership of Noah Assad and Jonathan Miranda. Later that month, Bad Bunny joined the ownership group. In October 2022, the Osos de Manatí returned from a short hiatus, when Puerto Rican singer Ozuna purchased the Brujos de Guayama and relocated the team to Manatí.

In game 1 of the 2023 BSN finals, LeBron James made a surprise appearance as the Gigantes defeated the Vaqueros, 89-85, in overtime to take a 1-0 series lead. On July 27 2023, the Gigantes De Carolina defeated the Vaqueros 80-60 in Game 5 of the BSN Finals, leading the Gigantes to become the 2023 BSN Champions.

In October of 2024, Molina sold ownership of his team.

===League records===
Rubén Rodríguez established most of the early long-standing records in the BSN. He broke both the single-season points record with 810 in 1978 and the highest career points record with 11,549. The current holder of the career mark is Georgie Torres, who broke it before retiring in 2001 with 15,863 points in 679 games, playing his first 7 years before the establishment of the three-point line. Rodríguez also holds the mark for most rebounds in a career with 6,178. He also held the single-season rebound record with 380 in 1978, which stood until Lee Benson broke it in 2008. Currently, Neftalí Rivera holds the record for most points in a game in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional when he scored 79 points on May 22, 1974. In that game he achieved the record by making 34 field goals (all of them 2-pointers as 3-pointers were not adopted back then) and 11 free throws. In 1989, Pablo Alicea of the Gigantes de Carolina established a record for most assists in one game with 25. The record stood for over two decades until May 1, 2012, when Jonathan García of the Caciques de Humacao broke it recording 33 assists against the Brujos de Guayama. García&#x27;s mark is an unofficial world record pending the approval of Guinness World Records, since there is no higher number recorded in any amateur or professional international league or in FIBA competition. During this game, the Caciques also established the team points record for a single game with 130 and for most scored during a single (10-minute) quarter with 46. The Vaqueros de Bayamón hosted the game with highest attendance in the league, with 17,621 fans attending a home game against Río Piedras on September 8, 1969. This bested the previous top of 16,564 in a game between Ponce and Santurce. The Vaqueros also hold the record for most consecutive championships, winning five from 1971 to 1975.

<doc id="85342" wikidata="Q192795" url="?curid=85342" title="Coke (fuel)">
<text>Coke is a grey, hard, and porous coal-based fuel with a high carbon content. It is made by heating coal or petroleum in the absence of air. Coke is an important industrial product, used mainly in iron ore smelting, but also as a fuel in stoves and forges.

The unqualified term &quot;coke&quot; usually refers to the product derived from low-ash and low-sulphur bituminous coal by a process called coking. A similar product called petroleum coke, or pet coke, is obtained from crude petroleum in petroleum refineries. Coke may also be formed naturally by geologic processes. It is the residue of a destructive distillation process.

==Production==

===Industrial coke furnaces===
The industrial production of coke from coal is called coking. The coal is baked in an airless kiln, a &quot;coke furnace&quot; or &quot;coking oven&quot;, at temperatures as high as but usually around . This process vaporises or decomposes organic substances in the coal, driving off water and other volatile and liquid products such as coal gas and coal tar. Coke is the non-volatile residue of the decomposition, the cemented-together carbon and mineral residue of the original coal particles in the form of a hard and somewhat glassy solid.

Additional byproducts of the coking are coal tar pitch, ammonia (NH3), hydrogen sulphide (H2S), pyridine, hydrogen cyanide and carbon based material. Some facilities have &quot;by-product&quot; coking ovens in which the volatile decomposition products are collected, purified and separated for use in other industries, as fuel or chemical feedstocks. Otherwise the volatile byproducts are burned to heat the coking ovens. This is an older method, but is still being used for new construction.

==== Sources ====
Bituminous coal must meet a set of criteria for use as coking coal, determined by particular coal assay techniques. These include moisture content, ash content, sulphur content, volatile content, tar, and plasticity. The goal is to achieve a blend of coal that when processed will produce a coke of appropriate strength (generally measured by coke strength after reaction), while losing an appropriate amount of mass. Other blending considerations include ensuring the coke will not swell too much during production and destroy the coke oven through excessive wall pressures.

The greater the volatile matter in coal, the more by-product can be produced. It is generally considered that levels of 26–29% of volatile matter in the coal blend are good for coking purposes. Thus, different types of coal are proportionally blended to reach acceptable levels of volatility before the coking process begins. If the range of coal types is too great, the resulting coke is of widely varying strength and ash content, and is usually unsaleable, although in some cases it may be sold as an ordinary heating fuel. As coke has already lost its volatile matter, it cannot be coked again.

Coking coal is different from thermal coal, but arises from the same basic coal-forming process. Coking coal has different macerals from thermal coal, i.e. different forms of the compressed and fossilized vegetative matter that compose the coal. The different macerals arise from different mixtures of the plant species, and variations of the conditions under which the coal has formed. Coking coal is graded according to its ash percentage-by-weight after burning:

* Steel Grade I (Ash content not exceeding 15%)
* Steel Grade II (Exceeding 15% but not exceeding 18%)
* Washery Grade I (Exceeding 18% but not exceeding 21%)
* Washery Grade II (Exceeding 21% but not exceeding 24%)
* Washery Grade III (Exceeding 24% but not exceeding 28%)
* Washery Grade IV (Exceeding 28% but not exceeding 35%)

===The &quot;hearth&quot; process===
The &quot;hearth&quot; process of coke-making, using lump coal, was akin to that of charcoal-burning; instead of a heap of prepared wood, covered with twigs, leaves and earth, there was a heap of coal, covered with coke dust. The hearth process continued to be used in many areas during the first half of the 19th century, but two events greatly lessened its importance. These were the invention of the hot blast in iron-smelting and the introduction of the beehive coke oven. The use of a blast of hot air, instead of cold air, in the smelting furnace was first introduced by Neilson in Scotland in 1828.
The hearth process of making coke from coal is a very lengthy process.

===Beehive coke oven===

A fire brick chamber shaped like a dome is used, commonly known as a beehive oven. It is typically about wide and high. The roof has a hole for charging the coal or other kindling from the top. A discharging hole is provided in the circumference of the lower part of the wall. In a coke oven battery, a number of ovens are built in a row with common walls between neighboring ovens. A battery consisted of a great many ovens, sometimes hundreds, in a row.

Coal is introduced from the top to produce an even layer of about deep. Air is supplied initially, to ignite the coal. Carbonization starts and produces volatile matter, which burns inside the partially closed side door. Carbonization proceeds from top to bottom and is completed in two to three days. The heat required for the process is supplied by the burning volatile matter, so no by-products are recovered. The exhaust gases are allowed to escape to the atmosphere. The hot coke is quenched with water, and is discharged manually through the side door. When the oven is used on a continuous basis, the walls and roof retain enough heat to initiate carbonization of the next charge.

When coal was burned in a coke oven, the impurities of the coal that were not driven off as gases accumulated in the oven as slag – effectively a conglomeration of the removed impurities. Since this slag was not the desired product, it was initially just discarded. Later, however, coke oven slag was found to be useful, and has since been used as an ingredient in brick-making, mixed cement, granule-covered shingles, and even as a fertilizer.

===Occupational safety===
People can be exposed to coke oven emissions in the workplace by inhalation, skin contact, or eye contact. For the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit for coke oven emissions exposure in the workplace as 0.150 mg/m3 benzene-soluble fraction over an eight-hour workday. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.2 mg/m3 benzene-soluble fraction over an eight-hour workday.

==Uses==
Coke can be used as a fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace. The carbon monoxide produced by combustion of coke reduces iron oxide (hematite) to produce iron: 
:&lt;chem&gt;Fe2O3 + 3CO -&gt; 2Fe + 3CO2&lt;/chem&gt;.

Coke is commonly used as fuel for blacksmithing.

Coke was used in Australia in the 1960s and early 1970s for house heating, and was incentivized for home use in the UK (so as to displace coal) after the 1956 Clean Air Act, which was passed in response to the Great Smog of London in 1952.

Since smoke-producing constituents are driven off during the coking of coal, coke forms a desirable fuel for stoves and furnaces in which conditions are not suitable for the complete burning of bituminous coal itself. Coke may be combusted producing little or no smoke, while bituminous coal would produce much smoke. Coke was widely used as a smokeless fuel substitute for coal in domestic heating following the creation of &quot;smokeless zones&quot; in the United Kingdom.

Highland Park distillery in Orkney roasts malted barley for use in their Scotch whisky in kilns burning a mixture of coke and peat.

Coke may be used to make synthesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen.
* Syngas; water gas: a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, made by passing steam over red-hot coke (or any carbon-based char). Hydrocarbonate (gas) is identical, although it emerged in the late eighteenth century as an inhalation therapeutic developed by Thomas Beddoes and James Watt categorized under factitious airs 
* Producer gas; wood gas; generator gas; synthetic gas: a mixture of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and nitrogen, made by passing air over red-hot coke (or any carbon-based char)
* Coke oven gas generated from coke ovens is similar to Syngas with 60% hydrogen by volume. The hydrogen can be extracted from the coke oven gas economically for various uses (including steel production).

===In foundry components ===
Finely ground bituminous coal, known in this application as sea coal, is a constituent of foundry sand. While the molten metal is in the mould, the coal burns slowly, releasing reducing gases at pressure, and so preventing the metal from penetrating the pores of the sand. It is also contained in &#x27;mould wash&#x27;, a paste or liquid with the same function applied to the mould before casting. Sea coal can be mixed with the clay lining (the &quot;bod&quot;) used for the bottom of a cupola furnace. When heated, the coal decomposes and the bod becomes slightly friable, easing the process of breaking open holes for tapping the molten metal.

==Phenolic byproducts==

Wastewater from coking is highly toxic and carcinogenic. It contains phenolic, aromatic, heterocyclic, and polycyclic organics, and inorganics including cyanides, sulfides, ammonium and ammonia. Various methods for its treatment have been studied in recent years. The white rot fungus &quot;Phanerochaete chrysosporium&quot; can remove up to 80% of phenols from coking waste water.

==Properties==
Before bituminous coal is used as coking coal, it must meet a set of criteria determined by particular coal assay techniques.

The bulk specific gravity of coke is typically around 0.77. It is highly porous. Both the chemical composition and physical properties are important to the usefulness of coke in blast furnaces. In terms of composition, low ash and sulphur content are desirable. Other important characteristics are the M10, M25, and M40 test crush indexes, which convey the strength of coke during transportation into the blast furnaces; depending on the blast furnace&#x27;s size, finely crushed coke pieces must not be allowed into the furnace because they would impede the flow of gas through the charge of iron and coke. A related characteristic is the Coke Strength After Reaction (CSR) index; it represents coke&#x27;s ability to withstand the violent conditions inside the blast furnace before turning into fine particles. Pieces of coke are denoted with the following terminology: &quot;bell coke&quot; (30 - 80 mm), &quot;nut coke&quot; (10 - 30 mm), &quot;coke breeze&quot; (&lt; 10 mm).

The water content in coke is practically zero at the end of the coking process, but it is often water quenched so that it can be transported to the blast furnaces. The porous structure of coke absorbs some water, usually 3–6% of its mass. In more modern coke plants an advanced method of coke cooling uses air quenching.

==Other processes==
The solid residue remaining from refinement of petroleum by the &quot;cracking&quot; process is also a form of coke. Petroleum coke has many uses besides being a fuel, such as the manufacture of dry cells and of electrolytic and welding electrodes.

Gas works manufacturing syngas also produce coke as an end product, called gas house coke.

Fluid coking is a process which converts heavy residual crude into lighter products such as naphtha, kerosene, heating oil, and hydrocarbon gases. The &quot;fluid&quot; term refers to the fact that solid coke particles behave as a fluid solid in the continuous fluid coking process versus the older batch delayed-coking process where a solid mass of coke builds up in the coke drum over time.

Due to a lack of oil or high-quality coals in East Germany, scientists developed a process to turn low-quality lignite into coke called high temperature lignite coke.

==Alternatives to coke==
Scrap steel can be recycled in an electric arc furnace; and an alternative to making iron by smelting is direct reduced iron, where any carbonaceous fuel can be used to make sponge or pelletised iron. To lessen carbon dioxide emissions hydrogen can be used as the reducing agent and biomass or waste as the source of carbon. Historically, charcoal has been used as an alternative to coke in a blast furnace, with the resultant iron being known as charcoal iron.

==History==

===China===
Many historical sources dating to the 4th century describe the production of coke in ancient China. The Chinese first used coke for heating and cooking no later than the 9th century. By the first decades of the 11th century, Chinese ironworkers in the Yellow River valley began to fuel their furnaces with coke, solving their fuel problem in that tree-sparse region. By 1078 CE, the implementation of coke as a replacement to charcoal in the production of iron in China dramatically increased the industry to 125,000 tons per year. The iron was used for the creation of tools, weapons, chains for suspension bridges, and Buddhist statues.

China is the largest producer and exporter of coke today. China produces 60% of the world&#x27;s coke. Concerns about air pollution have motivated technological changes in the coke industry by elimination of outdated coking technologies that are not energy-efficient.

===Britain===
In 1589, a patent was granted to Thomas Proctor and William Peterson for making iron and steel and melting lead with &quot;earth-coal, sea-coal, turf, and peat&quot;. The patent contains a distinct allusion to the preparation of coal by &quot;cooking&quot;. In 1590, a patent was granted to the Dean of York to &quot;purify pit-coal and free it from its offensive smell&quot;. In 1620, a patent was granted to a company composed of William St. John and other knights, mentioning the use of coke in smelting ores and manufacturing metals. In 1627, a patent was granted to Sir John Hacket and Octavius de Strada for a method of rendering sea-coal and pit-coal as useful as charcoal for burning in houses, without offense by smell of smoke.

In 1603, Hugh Plat suggested that coal might be charred in a manner analogous to the way charcoal is produced from wood. This process was not employed until 1642, when coke was used for roasting malt in Derbyshire; previously, brewers had used wood, as uncoked coal cannot be used in brewing because its sulphurous fumes would impart a foul taste to the beer. It was considered an improvement in quality, and brought about an &quot;alteration which all England admired&quot;—the coke process allowed for a lighter roast of the malt, leading to the creation of what by the end of the 17th century was called pale ale.
In 1709, Abraham Darby I established a coke-fired blast furnace to produce cast iron. Coke&#x27;s superior crushing strength allowed blast furnaces to become taller and larger. The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the factors leading to the Industrial Revolution. Before this time, iron-making used large quantities of charcoal, produced by burning wood. As the coppicing of forests became unable to meet the demand, the substitution of coke for charcoal became common in Great Britain, and coke was manufactured by burning coal in heaps on the ground so that only the outer layer burned, leaving the interior of the pile in a carbonized state. In the late 18th century, brick beehive ovens were developed, which allowed more control over the burning process.

In 1768, John Wilkinson built a more practical oven for converting coal into coke. Wilkinson improved the process by building the coal heaps around a low central chimney built of loose bricks and with openings for the combustion gases to enter, resulting in a higher yield of better coke. With greater skill in the firing, covering and quenching of the heaps, yields were increased from about 33% to 65% by the middle of the 19th century. The Scottish iron industry expanded rapidly in the second quarter of the 19th century, through the adoption of the hot-blast process in its coalfields.

In 1802, a battery of beehive ovens was set up near Sheffield, to coke the Silkstone coal seam for use in crucible steel melting. By 1870, there were 14,000 beehive ovens in operation on the West Durham coalfields, producing 4,000,000 long tons of coke per year. As a measure of the expansion of coke making, the requirements of the iron industry in Britain were about 1,000,000 tons per year in the early 1850s, rising to about 7,000,000 tons by 1880. Of these, about 5,000,000 tons were produced in Durham county, 1,000,000 tons in the South Wales coalfield, and 1,000,000 tons in Yorkshire and Derbyshire.
In the first years of steam locomotives, coke was the normal fuel. This resulted from an early piece of environmental legislation; any proposed locomotive had to &quot;consume its own smoke&quot;. This was not technically possible to achieve until the firebox arch came into use, but burning coke, with its low smoke emissions, was considered to meet the requirement. This rule was quietly dropped, and cheaper coal became the normal fuel, as railways gained acceptance among the public. The smoke plume produced by a travelling locomotive seems now to be a mark of a steam railway, and so preserved for posterity.

So-called &quot;gas works&quot; produced coke by heating coal in enclosed chambers. The flammable gas that was given off was stored in gas holders, to be used domestically and industrially for cooking, heating and lighting. The gas was commonly known as &quot;town gas&quot; since underground networks of pipes ran through most towns. It was replaced by &quot;natural gas&quot; (initially from the North Sea oil and gas fields) in the decade after 1967. Other byproducts of coke production included tar and ammonia, while the coke was used instead of coal in cooking ranges and to provide heat in domestic premises before the advent of central heating.

===United States===
In the US, the first use of coke in an iron furnace occurred around 1817 at Isaac Meason&#x27;s Plumsock puddling furnace and rolling mill in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. In the late 19th century, the coalfields of western Pennsylvania provided a rich source of raw material for coking. In 1885, the Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal and Iron Company constructed the world&#x27;s longest string of coke ovens in Walston, Pennsylvania, with 475 ovens over a length of 2 km (1.25 miles). Their output reached 22,000 tons per month. The Minersville Coke Ovens in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.

Between 1870 and 1905, the number of beehive ovens in the US increased from approximately 200 to nearly 31,000, which produced nearly 18,000,000 tons of coke in the Pittsburgh area alone. One observer boasted that if loaded into a train, &quot;the year&#x27;s production would make up a train so long that the engine in front of it would go to San Francisco and come back to Connellsville before the caboose had gotten started out of the Connellsville yards!&quot; The number of beehive ovens in Pittsburgh peaked in 1910 at almost 48,000.

Although it made a top-quality fuel, coking poisoned the surrounding landscape. After 1900, the serious environmental damage of beehive coking attracted national notice, although the damage had plagued the district for decades. &quot;The smoke and gas from some ovens destroy all vegetation around the small mining communities&quot;, noted W. J. Lauck of the U.S. Immigration Commission in 1911. Passing through the region on train, University of Wisconsin president Charles Van Hise saw &quot;long rows of beehive ovens from which flame is bursting and dense clouds of smoke issuing, making the sky dark. By night, the scene is rendered indescribably vivid by these numerous burning pits. The beehive ovens make the entire region of coke manufacture one of dulled sky: cheerless and unhealthful.&quot;

In 2024, an investigation into 17 coke burning facilities in the US could be responsible for an estimated 892 premature deaths every year, as well as increased asthma symptoms and other health impacts for residents.

<text>Areia () was a cultic epithet of the Greek goddess Athena, under which she was worshipped at Athens.

Athena&#x27;s statue, together with those of Ares, Aphrodite Areia, and Enyo, stood in the temple of Ares at Athens. There was also a colossal acrolithic statue of her, at a temple at Plataea, built with the spoils given to that city by the Athenians after the Battle of Marathon. This was supposedly created by the artist Pheidias, though there is some disagreement among modern scholars whether this was indeed created by that artist. Plutarch mentions a gilded statue in this temple, but does not specify the name of the deity it honors.

Athena&#x27;s worship under this name was said to have been instituted by Orestes after he had been acquitted by the Areopagus of the murder of his mother. It was Athena Areia who gave her casting vote in cases where the Areopagites were equally divided. There is some epigraphic evidence of a distinct priesthood for this aspect of Athena, but all we have are incomplete fragments, primarily of an oath from this priesthood at Acharnae.

From these circumstances, it has been surmised by some scholars (primarily in the 19th century) that the name &quot;Areia&quot; ought not to be derived from Ares, but from &quot;ara&quot; (ἀρά), a prayer, or from &quot;areo&quot; (ἀρέω) or &quot;aresko&quot; (ἀρέσκω), to propitiate or atone for. This is not considered likely by modern scholars.

<text>The statue of Athena Parthenos () was a monumental chryselephantine sculpture of the goddess Athena. Attributed to Phidias and dated to the mid-fifth century BCE, it was an offering from the city of Athens to Athena, its tutelary deity. The naos of the Parthenon on the acropolis of Athens was designed exclusively to accommodate it.

Many artists and craftsmen worked on the realization of the sculpture, which was probably built around a core of cypress wood, and then paneled with gold and ivory plates. At about 13 meters high, the statue reflected the established aesthetic canon of the severe style (clothing) while adopting the innovations of the high classical (leg position). She was helmeted and held a large round shield and spear, placed on the ground to her left, next to her sacred snake. Clothes, jewellery, accessories, and even the statue base were decorated, mainly with the snake and gorgon motif.

The statue was lost at an unknown date sometime in the first millennium. Several replicas and works were inspired by the original.

==Parthenon and statue of Athena==
In 480 BCE, the Persians ransacked the Acropolis of Athens, including the pre-Parthenon, which was under construction at the time. After their victories in Salamis and Plataea, the Athenians had sworn not to complete the destroyed temples but to leave them as they were, in memory of the Persian &quot;barbarism&quot;. In the succeeding years, however, Athens grew to control much of the region through its domination of the Delian League, a confederation of Greek states originally designed to protect themselves against the Persians. Within 30 years, the league had evolved into an Athenian powerhouse. By 454 BCE, the Delian treasury had been relocated to Athens, where the money was funnelled into an ambitious plan to rebuild the city and its destroyed temples, including the Parthenon.

The new Parthenon was erected between 447 and 438 BCE. Pericles chose the sculptor Phidias to supervise the building program with the architects Ictinos and Kallikrates. The sekos (closed part surrounded by the peristyle) was divided into two rooms. The small one to the west, the &quot;Parthenon&quot; itself (the &quot;virgin room&quot;), housed the treasure of the League of Delos and other offerings. To the east, the &quot;hecatompedos neos&quot; housed the statue of &quot;Athena Parthenos&quot;. The room was 29.90 m long, or around one hundred Athenian feet, by 19 m wide, with a ceiling height of 12.50 m.

The new building was not intended to become a temple, but a treasury meant to house the colossal chryselephantine statue of &quot;Athena Parthenos&quot;. It is even likely that the statue project preceded the building project. This was an offering from the city to the goddess, but not a statue of worship: there was no priestess of &quot;Athena Parthenos&quot;.

Primary ancient sources about the statue are writings by Pausanias and Pliny the Elder. Pausanias is also the originator of the surname &quot;Parthenos.&quot; Early writings mentioned &quot;the statue&quot;, &quot;the statue of Athena&quot;, &quot;the golden statue of Athena&quot;, &quot;the ivory statue of Athena&quot;, or simply &quot;the Athena.&quot; Since at least the end of the fifth century BCE, however, the patron goddess of the Parthenon has been known as &quot;Athena Parthenos.&quot;

==Construction==
According to Pausanias and Plutarch, the statue is not by Phidias alone but of a team of craftsmen representing several trades, Phidias supervising all the decoration work of the Parthenon. The location of the workshop where the statue was made is unknown. It could have been on the acropolis, at the eastern end, under what was later to become the old Acropolis museum. However, given the cost of precious materials (gold and ivory), it could also have been installed elsewhere, at the foot of the sacred rock, far from the comings and goings of the main site and its dust.

The statue was likely made of &quot;spare parts&quot;, perhaps first mounted in the workshop, then dismantled, moved to the Parthenon, after its completion, and installed in its final place. The remaining accounts make it possible to estimate the cost of the work at 704 talents, or the equivalent of 200 Triremes (the city&#x27;s naval power base). However, the statue was considered an ultimate financial reserve, the gold decorating it could be melted down if necessary. According to the various ancient authors, the weight of gold used was between 40 and 50 talents, or between 1 and 1.3 tons of gold. By way of comparison, the annual toll of the &quot;allies&quot; of the League of Delos at the time amounted to 28 talents. On another note, this gold would have represented for the city of Athens more than a year&#x27;s salary for 10,000 skilled workers, more than a year&#x27;s pay for 10,000 hoplites or 10,000 rowers in the war fleet. The quantity and cost of ivory are more difficult to determine. It was needed for the face, arms, and feet of the statue, as well as for the gorgon&#x27;s head depicted on the goddess&#x27;s chest. It is less certain that ivory could have been used for the rendering of snake scales. On an inscription of 440-439 BCE there is recorded the purchase of an unknown amount of elephant ivory for the sum of 24 talents and 743 silver drachmas. However, it is difficult to know if this constituted all the necessary material.

The statue was mounted on a rot-proof wooden frame, probably cypress. A decree of the Athenians thanks the people of the Eteocarpathians for providing them with a large quantity of cypress wood. This wood came from a forest dedicated to Apollo and therefore could only be exploited for religious purposes. In the Parthenon&#x27;s soil is still visible the hole (75.5 cm by 54 cm and 37 cm deep) where the central beam was planted. Around this &quot;mast&quot;, a whole frame in the same cypress wood gave shape to the statue. The city had the technique and craftsmen capable of this work with its many marine carpenters. To this reinforcement were fixed, probably nailed, gold plates. It is not possible to know if they had been melted (and the moulds preserved, perhaps in case of repair) or hammered (Sphyrelaton technique). Ivory work was much more difficult, even if the statue of &quot;Athena Parthenos&quot; was not the first Greek statue to use this imported material. Oppian gives valuable indications of the techniques used. The necessary surfaces (face, arms, and feet) far exceeded the size of elephant tusks. However, these are made up of thin layers of superimposed ivory that can be &quot;unrolled like a roll of papyrus&quot;. The next problem was to give shape to these long blades. It was the work of specialists able to soften the material and then mould it. The ivory plates thus created had the flexibility of the wax plates used for moulding bronze statues, a technique that Phidias mastered perfectly. If the gold plates were probably directly nailed to the frame, the more fragile ivory was certainly fixed more delicately with dowels or glued with fish glue. The joints between ivory plates would most certainly have been masked in the drop shadows and by jewellery (bracelets and necklace). The ivory then had to be polished, most often with squatine skins (type of shark). Finally, the ivory was painted: the goddess was &quot;made-up&quot;, using red pigment on her cheeks and lips as well as on her nails. It is also very unlikely that the gold was left as is; it would likely have been inlaid with precious and semi-precious stones that reflected the light.

The statue must have been completed in 438 BCE when it was consecrated and installed in the Parthenon. Gold and ivory that had not been used were then offered for sale.

==Description==

The statue was installed in the main room of the Parthenon to the east. Behind her and on her sides, Doric columns supported the roof and offered her the setting of a canopy. In front of her, a large basin filled with water played several roles: it was used to maintain a sufficient degree of humidity in the room (to conserve ivory) and it also had to reflect the external light and illuminate the work. It was suggested that there could have been windows (probably 3 m high and 2.5 m wide) on each side of the door (9.75 m high and 4.19 m wide) that would have allowed daylight in.

The statue measured, according to Pliny the Elder, 26 cubits (about 11.50 m high), probably counting its base. It thus reached less than one and a half meters from the ceiling. She therefore filled the room with her presence. Phidias&#x27; idea was apparently to represent the goddess under her &quot;true&quot; aspect, in all her majesty, beauty, magnificence, or even in her real size, since the gods were considered proportionally much greater than humans.

Only the pedestal of the statue has been preserved. It is a parallelepiped in poros measuring and high. On the front of this base, a carved plaque evoked the birth of Pandora in the presence of twenty gods. It is the only decorative element that has not subsequently been copied and reproduced, so it is unknown in its details. It is not even possible to know if it was made of marble or gilded bronze. The presence of this theme (birth of the first woman, plus fatal woman) is quite difficult to reconcile with the representation of the virgin goddess of wisdom. It was perhaps a symbol of both aspects of femininity, or even the growing role of women in Athens in the fifth century BCE. Other interpretations are proposed. Helios and Selene framed the scene; it is, therefore, possible to see it as a form of calendar. Pandora can also be read as a warning that with the gods, nothing was ever taken for granted. Thus, the triumphant Athens of Pericles mastered modern techniques, just as the first men had mastered fire. They had thus unbalanced the old order and had been punished (with a woman made by Hephaistus, god of fire and techniques). Athens, therefore, had to avoid falling into hubris. More optimistically, Pandora&#x27;s myth could be a reminder that even deep in the difficulties, hope can always be reborn. Finally, far from Pandora described by Hesiod and quoted by Pausanias to evoke the decoration of the base, there is an Athenian Pandora. She is one of the daughters of Erechtheus, one of the Hyacinthides who sacrificed herself to save the city. She would have had a miraculous birth, of the autochthonic type, and was linked to the goddess Athena, mainly by weaving. Pandora was presented in this Athenian myth as a kourotrophic (child carrier therefore a nurse) and a bearer of benefits. From then on, Joan Connelly proposes to read the scene as the apotheosis of Athenian Pandora, and not as the birth of the &quot;Hesiodic&quot; Pandora.

The Athena wore a half-open peplos on the right side, as was the rule for female representations in the first half of the fifth century BCE. However, her posture was new (in the canon that Polykleitos would then develop for his athlete statues): the left leg was a little bent, the knee forward, the heel not posing on the ground. This posture seems to have been chosen more for technical reasons of balance and volume of the lower manikin than for aesthetic reasons. The bust, on the other hand, does not seem to have been affected by the imbalance of the lower body, it would have been very straight and frontal.

Over her peplos, she bore at the breast the aegis lined with snakes and within its centre, at the level of the solar plexus, an ivory gorgoneion. The goddess&#x27; face was also ivory, probably with a neutral expression, as was then the aesthetic rule. However, she may have had her lips ajar, symbolizing the breath of life. Gemstones allowed her eyes to have the Persian colour corresponding to one of Athena&#x27;s epithets. Long strands of hair escaped from her helmet and descended to the aegis. It was a reinterpretation of the korai hairstyle, the archaic statues of young women abundantly dedicated to the goddess on the acropolis of Athens. The helmet was of the Attic type, with paragnathides (pieces protecting the cheeks) raised and decorated with gryphons. The top of the helmet had three crests: a sphinx in the centre, surrounded on each side by a winged horse. The visor was decorated with protomes. The edge of her sandals (&quot;Etruscan&quot; type), about 20 cm high, was decorated with a painted or carved centauromachy, the sources do not allow a conclusive answer. Her belt was two snakes tied. Athena also wore jewellery: a pendant on each ear, snake-shaped bracelets on each wrist and biceps, and a necklace.

The left hand held her shield and spear. At her feet on the left side, her sacred snake nestled. In her right hand, perhaps leaning on a column to support her, she held a statue of Nike, 2 m high. This symbolization of victory itself held a crown of gold laurels, which she was to be about to place on the goddess&#x27;s head. The column is present in copies where it is necessary for reasons of the balance of terracotta or marble, but its existence for the original statue remains much discussed. The presence of a column could then explain the fact that Athena&#x27;s sacred snake was placed to her left (where it partially hid the shield decoration), rather than to her right, its usual place. If this column were present, it could also have been the first example of a Corinthian capital, then developed by the two architects on their temple of Apollo in Bassae.

The shield with a diameter of was decorated on the outside with an amazonomachy. This was the most visible, therefore the most described and copied decorative element. In the centre was again a gorgoneion that must have looked like the Rondanini Medusa since it is strongly inspired by it. He was surrounded by about thirty fighters. Theseus commanded the Greek troops, so the Athenians. In front of them, Amazons were attacking the Acropolis as indicated by the steep scenery. According to Plutarch, Phidias represented himself among the Athenians, in the centre at the top, as a bald old man preparing to throw the stone held with two hands above his head. He would also have included Pericles, right next to him, on the right, armed with a spear. This gesture, which was criticized for him, is however proof that this relief-carved decoration was indeed by the hand of Phidias himself. The inside of the shield, less visible, was painted with a gigantomachy. The three fights represented on the statue (centauromachy, gigantomachy, and amazonomachy) were also found on the carved decoration of the Parthenon. The southern metopes are decorated with a centauromachy, those in the east with a gigantomachy, and those in the west with an amazonomachy.

The snake (δράκων), perhaps represented the Chthonian powers that would have been present on the acropolis from the beginning, or even Erichthonios himself whom the goddess had raised on her sacred rock. In fact, the monsters (sphinx, gryphons, winged horses, snakes, and gorgonians) that adorn the statue of the deity symbolize these primitive forces she domesticated.

The themes chosen to decorate this statue, as well as those that adorned the entire building, were part of an iconographic and political program of the celebration of the city through its guardian goddess. Athens, at the height of its power in the time of Pericles, evoked here the victory of (its) civilization over chaos, disorder, hybris, and barbarism in general, even beyond the commemoration of its victory in the Median wars. The virtues and piety of the city were read in its offering to its goddess. Its commercial and naval power materialized in the materials used: gold and ivory, very expensive, from far away.

==History==
Ivory, a fragile material and subject to desiccation, was maintained with oiled water that was left available in a basin at the foot of the statue. The oil layer left a protective film preventing evaporation and giving shine to the ivory.

The luxury of the statue contrasted with its interior filled, like all chryselephantine statues, with &quot;levers, corners, nails that cross the machine from side to side, ankles, pitch, clay and other things as shocking to the eye, not to mention an infinity of flies or shrews&quot;, as Lucian describes in Dream or the Rooster, XXIV.18.

According to sources in 438 BCE (from the consecration of the statue) or in 432 BCE (just before the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War), Phidias was accused of diverting part of the precious metals used to make the statue of &quot;Athena Parthenos&quot;, which was also sacrilege in itself since gold belonged to the goddess. Arrested, he would have escaped, which was interpreted as an admission of guilt. He reportedly fled to Olympia where he made the Chryselephantine statue of Zeus and where he died. For historians, an accusation against Phidias would then have been a way for Pericles&#x27; political opponents to attack the archon. Later, between 300 and 295 BCE, the tyrant Lachares allegedly had the gold plates removed to pay his troops. However, the veracity of this gesture is difficult to establish. If Lachares had taken gold permanently, he committed sacrilege. If his gesture was a simple &quot;borrowing&quot; from Athena, the rule was to repay with interest, difficult if the only way to obtain funds was to strip the goddess.

The Parthenon was ravaged by a fire at an indeterminate date in late antiquity, causing serious damage. The roof collapsed. The Doric columns of the naos were replaced by columns from the Hellenistic stoas of the Roman agora. The statue was damaged but restored. It may have been transported to Constantinople with the Chryselephantine statue of Zeus of Olympia where it could still have been in the 10th century CE. Another hypothesis is based on the presence of traces of a second base. The statue of &quot;Athena Parthenos&quot; could then have been replaced, at an indeterminate point in time. Until the edict of Theodosius in 380, the Parthenon retained its pagan religious role. It then seems to have experienced a more or less long period of abandonment. Somewhere between the fifth and the seventh century, the building was transformed into a church. Sources do not mention the statue at that time; it is therefore not possible to know if it had been destroyed or transported to Constantinople.


==Antique copies and replicas==
At least sixty-nine small-scale copies of the statue are known. Very early on, her influence was felt, sometimes very far away. Thus, gold medallions from a tomb in Kul-Oba (Crimea) and preserved in the Hermitage Museum, reproduce the head of the statue. During Roman times, small copies were mass-produced, sometimes simplifying the decor. The Athena of Varvákeion is one of the most famous examples. Sometimes, only the decoration was reproduced, mainly that of the outside of the shield, apparently in the form of decorative plates for export.

Among the most famous ancient copies are the Lenormant Athena and therefore the Athena of Varvakeion preserved in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens, the Minerva with the necklace of the Louvre Museum or a Roman copy signed Antiochos preserved at the Palazzo Altemps (Roman National Museum). A restoration was made by sculptor Pierre-Charles Simart between 1846 and 1855 for the Duke of Luynes. It is exhibited in its castle in Dampierre.

A life-size replica was made in 1990 for the Nashville Parthenon by American sculptor Alan LeQuire. On a steel and aluminium frame, a mixture of plaster and fibreglass was covered with 8 kg of gold leaf.

<text>In Roman religion, the genius (; : &quot;genii&quot;) is the individual instance of a general divine nature that is present in every individual person, place, or thing. Much like a guardian angel, the &quot;genius&quot; would follow each man from the hour of his birth until the day he died. For women, it was the Juno spirit that would accompany each of them.

==Nature==
Each individual place had a &quot;genius&quot; (&quot;genius loci&quot;) and so did powerful objects, such as volcanoes. The concept extended to some specifics: the &quot;genius&quot; of the theatre, of vineyards, and of festivals, which made performances successful, grapes grow, and celebrations succeed, respectively. It was extremely important in the Roman mind to propitiate the appropriate &quot;genii&quot; for the major undertakings and events of their lives. 

 Thus man, following the dictates of his heart, venerated something higher and more divine than he could find in his own limited individuality, and brought to &quot;this great unknown of himself&quot; offerings as a god; thus compensating by veneration for the indistinct knowledge of his divine origin. 

The Christian theologian Augustine equated the Christian soul with the Roman &quot;genius&quot;, citing Varro as attributing the rational powers and abilities of every human being to their &quot;genius&quot;.

==Specific genii==

Although the term &quot;genius&quot; might apply to any divinity whatsoever, most of the higher-level and state &quot;genii&quot; had their own well-established names. &quot;Genius&quot; applied most often to individual places or people not generally known; that is, to the smallest units of society and settlements, families and their homes. Houses, doors, gates, streets, districts, tribes, each one had its own &quot;genius&quot;. The supreme hierarchy of the Roman gods, like that of the Greeks, was modelled after a human family. It featured a father, Jupiter, who was also the supreme divine unity, and a mother, Juno, queen of the gods. These supreme unities were subdivided into &quot;genii&quot; for each individual family; hence, the &quot;genius&quot; of each female, representing the female reproductive power, was a &quot;Juno&quot;. The male power was a &quot;Jupiter&quot;.

The &quot;Juno&quot; was venerated under many titles:
*&quot;Iugalis&quot;, &quot;of marriage&quot;
*&quot;Matronalis&quot;, &quot;of married women&quot;
*&quot;Pronuba&quot;, &quot;of brides&quot;
*&quot;Virginalis&quot;, &quot;of virginity&quot;

&quot;Genii&quot; were often viewed as protective spirits, as one would propitiate them for protection. For example, to protect infants one propitiated a number of deities concerned with birth and childrearing: &quot;Cuba&quot; (&quot;lying down to sleep&quot;), &quot;Cunina&quot; (&quot;of the cradle&quot;) and &quot;Rumina&quot; (&quot;of breast-feeding&quot;). Certainly, if those &quot;genii&quot; did not perform their proper function well, the infant would be in danger.

Hundreds of &quot;lararia&quot;, or family shrines, have been discovered at Pompeii, typically off the atrium, kitchen or garden, where the smoke of burnt offerings could vent through the opening in the roof. Each &quot;lararium&quot; features a panel fresco containing the same theme: two peripheral figures (Lares) attend on a central figure (family &quot;genius&quot;) or two figures (&quot;genius&quot; and &quot;juno&quot;) who may or may not be at an altar. In the foreground is one or two serpents crawling toward the &quot;genius&quot; through a meadow motif. Campania and Calabria preserved an ancient practice of keeping a propitious house snake, here linked with the &quot;genius&quot;.

==History of the concept==

===Origin===

The English term is borrowed from Latin &quot;,&quot; &quot;household guardian spirit&quot;; earlier, &quot;innate male power of a race or clan&quot;, deriving from the Indo-European root *g̑enh₁-, &quot;give birth, produce&quot;, which is also reflected in Latin &quot;gignō&quot;, &quot;give birth&quot;, and &quot;, gentis&quot;, &quot;tribe, people&quot;.

The &quot;genius&quot; appears explicitly in Roman literature as early as Plautus, where one character jests that the father of another is so avaricious that he uses cheap Samian ware in sacrifices to his own &quot;genius&quot;, so as not to tempt the &quot;genius&quot; to steal it. In this passage, the &quot;genius&quot; is not identical to the person, as to propitiate oneself would be absurd, and yet the &quot;genius&quot; also has the avarice of the person; that is, the same character, the implication being, like person, like &quot;genius&quot;.

Horace, writing when the first emperor was introducing the cult of his own &quot;genius&quot;, describes the &quot;genius&quot; as &quot;the companion which controls the natal star; the god of human nature, in that he is mortal for each person, with a changing expression, white or black&quot;.

===Imperial genii===

Octavius Caesar on return to Rome after the final victory of the Roman Civil War at the Battle of Actium appeared to the Senate to be a man of great power and success, clearly a mark of divinity. In recognition of the prodigy they voted that all banquets should include a libation to his &quot;genius&quot;. In concession to this sentiment he chose the name Augustus, capturing the numinous meaning of English &quot;august&quot;. The household cult of the &quot;Genius Augusti&quot; dates from this period. It was propitiated at every meal along with the other household &quot;numina&quot;. Thus began the tradition of the Roman imperial cult, in which Romans cultivated the &quot;genius&quot; of the emperor rather than the person.
If the &quot;genius&quot; of the &quot;imperator&quot;, or commander of all troops, was to be propitiated, so was that of all the units under his command. The provincial troops expanded the idea of the &quot;genii&quot; of state; for example, from Roman Britain have been found altars to the &quot;genii&quot; of &quot;Roma&quot;, &quot;Roma aeterna&quot;, &quot;Britannia&quot;, and to every &quot;legion&quot;, &quot;cohors&quot;, &quot;ala&quot; and &quot;centuria&quot; in Britain, as well as to the &quot;praetorium&quot; of every &quot;castra&quot; and even to the &quot;vexillae&quot;. Inscriptional dedications to &quot;genius&quot; were not confined to the military. From Gallia Cisalpina under the empire are numerous dedications to the &quot;genii&quot; of persons of authority and respect; in addition to the emperor&#x27;s &quot;genius principis&quot;, were the &quot;genii&quot; of patrons of freedmen, owners of slaves, patrons of guilds, philanthropists, officials, villages, other divinities, relatives and friends. Sometimes the dedication is combined with other words, such as &quot;to the genius and honor&quot; or in the case of couples, &quot;to the genius and Juno&quot;.

Surviving from the time of the empire hundreds of dedicatory, votive and sepulchral inscriptions ranging over the entire territory testify to the flourishing of official cult &quot;(cultus&quot;) of &quot;genius&quot;. Stock phrases were abbreviated: GPR, &quot;genio populi Romani&quot; (&quot;to the genius of the Roman people&quot;); GHL, &quot;genio huius loci&quot; (&quot;to the genius of this place&quot;); GDN, &quot;genio domini nostri&quot; (&quot;to the genius of our master&quot;), and so on. In 392 AD with the final victory of Christianity Theodosius I declared the veneration of the &quot;genii&quot;, Lares and Penates to be treason, ending their official terms. The concept, however, continued in representation and speech under different names or with accepted modifications.

==Roman iconography==

===Coins===
The &quot;genius&quot; of a corporate social body is often a cameo theme on ancient coins: a denarius from Spain, 76–75 BC, featuring a bust of the &quot;GPR&quot; (&quot;Genius Populi Romani&quot;, &quot;&quot;Genius&quot; of the Roman People&quot;) on the obverse; an aureus of Siscia in Croatia, 270–275 AD, featuring a standing image of the &quot;GENIUS ILLVR&quot; (&quot;Genius Exercitus Illyriciani&quot;, &quot;&quot;Genius&quot; of the Illyrian Army&quot;) on the reverse; an aureus of Rome, 134–138 AD, with an image of a youth holding a &quot;cornucopia&quot; and &quot;patera&quot; (sacrificial dish) and the inscription GENIOPR, &quot;genio populi Romani&quot;, &quot;to the &quot;genius&quot; of the Roman people&quot;, on the reverse.

<doc id="85369" wikidata="Q1402198" url="?curid=85369" title="Hersilia">
<text>In Roman mythology, Hersilia was a figure in the foundation myth of Rome. She is credited with ending the war between Rome and the Sabines.

==Battle of the Lacus Curtius==
In some accounts she is the wife of Romulus, the founder and first king of Rome in Rome&#x27;s founding myths. She is described as such in both Livy and Plutarch; but in Dionysius, Macrobius, and another tradition recorded by Plutarch, she was instead the wife of Hostus Hostilius, a Roman champion at the time of Romulus. This would make her the grandmother of Tullus Hostilius, the third king of Rome.

Livy tells this tale in his work &quot;Ab urbe condita&quot;:

Just like her husband (who became the god Quirinus), she was deified after her death as Hora Quirini, as recounted in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;:


Very little concrete information is known about the deity Hora Quirini. According to Georg Wissowa, Ovid created the story of Hersilia&#x27;s apotheosis into Hora Quirini. On the other hand, T.P. Wiseman argues that the story comes from an earlier Greek source.

<text>Robert Arum (born December 8, 1931) is an American lawyer and boxing promoter. He is the founder and CEO of Top Rank, a professional boxing promotion company based in Las Vegas. Prior to becoming a boxing promoter, Arum was employed as an attorney in the tax division of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

==Background and early life==

Arum was born in New York City. He grew up in the Crown Heights section of New York, with an Orthodox Jewish background.

==Education and legal career==
He attended Erasmus Hall High School, New York University, then Harvard Law School with fellow students recalled as &quot;snooty guys from the prep schools and the eating clubs,&quot; where he was graduated &quot;cum laude&quot;. He worked as an attorney in the United States Department of Justice during the Kennedy administration, and had little interest in boxing until 1965.

Following the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy and his Justice Department service under Robert F. Kennedy; Arum joined Wall Street law firm Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim &amp; Ballon, where he researched Kennedy&#x27;s assassination for senior partner Louis Nizer, author of the foreword to the Warren Commission Report.

In 1963, as a prosecutor for the Department of justice, Arum&#x27;s work led to the indictment of the president of the Washington Heights Savings and Loan Association, Floyd Cramer, for leading a mortgage tax-evasion scheme. Cramer committed suicide hours after being indicted, at which time Arum recalled, &quot;What kind of person causes another man to take his own life? I was ashamed. I knew then that I wasn&#x27;t cut out to be a prosecutor&quot;. Arum continued to practice civil law until dissolving his office in 1979.

==Boxing promoter==
In 1962, Arum was assigned by the Department of Justice to confiscate proceeds from the September 25, 1962 Sonny Liston vs. Floyd Patterson world heavyweight boxing title fight; during which he met closed-circuit television (CCTV) pioneer and former Leo Burnett &amp; Co. vice-president Lester M. Malitz (1907 – July 24, 1965) of Lester M. Malitz Inc. Malitz was the promoter of the 1965 Terrell–Chuvalo bout, during which he retained Arum to represent him. In 1966, subsequent to a suggestion by Jim Brown, whom Arum had secured for Malitz as the fight&#x27;s announcer, Arum became a boxing promoter. In 2016, Brown recalled that Arum had seen a televised fight in 1965, as &quot;The first fight Arum ever saw was Terrell–Chuvalo, and he watched that from the television truck.&quot; Arum credits Brown with introducing him to Muhammad Ali, and Ali with teaching him how to be a boxing promoter.

Arum became a vice-president and secretary of Ali&#x27;s promotion company, Main Bout. Mike Malitz, son of Lester, like Arum, owned 20 percent of the company and became its vice-president. Jim Brown owned 10 percent of the company and served as its vice-president in charge of publicity. Referencing his first live fight viewing, Arum was reported as saying that he &quot;had never seen a boxing match before the first fight I did with Ali&quot;, referring to the 1966 Muhammad Ali vs. George Chuvalo bout.

During the 1980s, Arum became a driving force behind the sport, rivaling Don King. Arum organized superfights including Marvin Hagler vs. Roberto Durán and Hagler vs. Thomas Hearns. Arum mounted the Hagler–John Mugabi, Hearns–James Shuler doubleheader in Las Vegas in April, 1986. After the Hearns–Shuler fight, Shuler, who had lost by knockout in the first round, showed up at Arum&#x27;s hotel room to thank him for the opportunity to fight Hearns. ten days after that bout, Shuler died in a motorcycle accident. In 1994, he tried to add basketball to his interests, joining forces with Fred Hofheinz and Louisiana politicians to purchase and relocate the Minnesota Timberwolves to New Orleans, but the deal was rejected.

Arum kept producing big-scale undercards and superfights, including the Hagler–Sugar Ray Leonard bout, the Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Thomas Hearns 1989 rematch, Evander Holyfield vs. George Foreman, and many others. Some of Arum&#x27;s superstars from the 1990s include former world flyweight champion Michael Carbajal, six-division world champion Oscar De La Hoya, eight-division world champion Manny Pacquiao, and three-division world champion Erik Morales. Arum also promoted the legendary champion Julio César Chávez in his later years of boxing.

Arum has concentrated largely on promoting Hispanic fighters in recent years, citing surveys which show boxing is among the most popular sports within the Hispanic community. This strategy began after his success signing Roberto Durán and promoting Durán&#x27;s comeback fight against Davey Moore, which demonstrated that he was not washed up after the 1980 &quot;No más&quot; fight. Next, he signed Julio César Chávez Jr. and Oscar De La Hoya. He has had great success with Puerto Rican Miguel Cotto, who won world titles at the 140, 147, 154, 160-pound weight divisions; Mexican-American Antonio Margarito, who held a 147-pound WBO belt from 2002 to 2007; Mexican-American José Ramírez, the former WBC and WBO light welterweight world champion; Honduran-American Teófimo López, the former lightweight world champion; and Mexican Óscar Valdez, the former WBC super featherweight world champion.

Arum has concentrated many of his shows in the Southwestern portion of the U.S., in cities with large Spanish-speaking populations. He is also the promoter of many of the cards on Telefutura, a Spanish language network. He later shifted over to Azteca América. In 2016, he put together an all-Hispanic undercard for Manny Pacquiao vs. Timothy Bradley III in protest of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump&#x27;s statements on Mexican immigration.

Arum was inducted into the International Boxing Hall Of Fame in 1999. In 2003 he was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

==Controversies==
As a boxing promoter, Arum had been involved in many spats and controversies, including a 40-year feud with Don King, with whom he has co-promoted several fights. UFC president Dana White has also been a vocal critic and the two have engaged in a protracted and acerbic public feud; in 2018, White briefly became a rival boxing promoter.

In 1994, he was involved with John Daly for the High Noon in Hong Kong boxing event. The fights were called off at the last minute when Barry Hearn scuttled the bout by withdrawing his fighters, when no purses were forthcoming from Top Rank.

In 2000, citing extortion, Arum voluntarily testified to having paid IBF president Robert W. &quot;Bobby&quot; Lee Sr. $100,000 in two installments in 1995, as the first half of a $200,000 bribe, through &quot;middleman, Stanley Hoffman&quot;, adding that Lee had first demanded $500,000 to approve the Schulz–Foreman fight but had settled for the lesser amount of $200,000 (half of which was never paid). Lee was indicted for racketeering in 1999, but convicted of money laundering and tax evasion in 2000. Following his testimony, Arum was sanctioned and fined $125,000 by the Nevada State Athletic Commission. Boxing promoters Cedric Kushner and Dino Duva also admitted to making similar payments to Lee.

Oscar De La Hoya successfully sued Arum and was legally released from his contract with Top Rank in January 2001. Following years of acrimony, he and De La Hoya publicly salvaged their relationship in 2014.

In 2003, Arum complained about judging in the September 13 bout between Oscar De La Hoya and Sugar Shane Mosley and suggested there was a vendetta against him from a member of the Nevada State Commission that led to De La Hoya&#x27;s loss. Arum later made an apology for the remark which commission chairman Luther Mack accepted.

In the first week of January 2004, FBI agents raided Arum&#x27;s Top Rank office in Las Vegas. Arum was on vacation when his office was raided and the FBI originally declined to comment on the raid. The news media reported that the FBI was investigating allegations that Top Rank was involved in fixing the rematch between De La Hoya and Shane Mosley, even though De La Hoya lost and Arum was De La Hoya&#x27;s promoter. The federal agency also announced it was investigating some of Eric Esch&#x27;s fights, as well as the Jorge Páez–Verdell Smith fight. The investigation closed in the summer of 2006 with no charges being filed.

In 2007, &quot;Yahoo Sports&quot; reported that, &quot;Floyd Mayweather Jr. essentially accused Arum, who promoted him from the beginning of his career in 1996 until 2006, of underpaying him, exploiting his talents and manipulating officials.&quot; Mayweather, who also became a boxing promoter, stated to &quot;Yahoo Sports&quot; in 2015, &quot;I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about Bob Arum.&quot;

Arum filed a lawsuit against HBO for overstepping its boundaries in the sport by becoming a de facto promoter while trying to intentionally eliminate him as a promoter. Arum complained that HBO dropped Mayweather from his exclusive deal after he insisted his fighter have a tougher bout than the network wanted. The suit was settled out of court but Arum continued to criticize HBO by saying &quot;Instead of working with promoters, like they have done in the past, they have become promoters themselves. They make the fights just like promoters and pay fighters&quot;, Arum said. &quot;It&#x27;s their money and they can do what they want but Don King doesn&#x27;t have to go along with it and neither do I. King and I can get along without HBO or Showtime ... The problem HBO Sports got into is they became defenders of the status quo. They held you back because they had control.&quot;

In 2009, Arum defended Antonio Margarito when he lost his boxing license in the US state of California on charges of illegal hand wraps, implying that it was racially motivated and stating that Top Rank would not come back to the state of California until the issue was rectified.

In 2020, Arum stated that one of his top boxers, Terence Crawford should also start promoting himself better. He compared his situation with several other greats in the sport. Arum stated he could have built a house in Beverly Hills with the money he lost on Crawford&#x27;s last three fights. Crawford did not take this lightly, responding through numerous media outlets showing his disappointment towards Arum&#x27;s comments&quot;.&quot; In January 2022, Crawford sued Arum for racial bias and for the money he lost by not being promoted well enough.

==Personal life==
Arum has been married twice. He had three children with his first wife: Richard, Elizabeth, and John. His son, environmental lawyer John Arum (1961–2010), fell to his death in 2010 while climbing the north face of Storm King, a mountain in North Cascades National Park; he is most remembered for his meticulous representation of Native American tribal rights.

In 1991, he married Lovee duBoef with whom he has two stepchildren; Todd duBoef, President of Top Rank and Dena duBoef, vice president of Top Rank. Arum was a close friend and business partner of the late billionaire casino tycoon, and CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corp, Sheldon Adelson.

Arum endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

==Cannabis advocate==
Arum, who appeared as corrupt DEA agent &quot;Stokes&quot; in the 1975 film &quot;The Marijuana Affair&quot; at the behest of his friend, Jamaican-born boxing promoter, filmmaker, bookie, and horse-racing aficionado Lucien Chen (June 6, 1928 – December 16, 2015), has advocated for the decriminalization of cannabis; and, in a 2017 interview, stated that he had started smoking it in 1966, declaring, &quot;Cannabis is good for you! It&#x27;s these damn people during the Nixon administration that really put cannabis into the position where it was a drug like heroin and cocaine and that was wrong&quot; and adding that &quot;in a lot of ways, marijuana is better for the athlete as pain medication than the drugs.” In a 2017 &quot;VICE&quot; interview (which erroneously reports film producer Chen as Shen); Arum was also quoted as saying, &quot;I think the NFL is gonna revise its policy on marijuana and I think everybody should. It was the Nixon administration that demonized marijuana, to the real harm of a lot of people, particularly people who have terminal cancer. Marijuana can be a very therapeutic thing.&quot;

==Film and television==
Arum has appeared on several television documentaries, boxing specials, movies and shows, usually being interviewed about a boxer or fight but occasionally as an actor himself, including in &quot;Play It To The Bone&quot; (where he played a boxing fan) and &quot;Arliss&quot;.

<text>In Vergil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Erulus is a king of Praeneste. At birth, he was given three souls (&quot;animae&quot;) by his mother, the goddess Feronia, who also tripled his ability to defend himself by giving him three sets of arms.

Vergil tells his story through the Arcadian king Evander, founder of Pallantium, who allies with the Trojan immigrants led by Aeneas. Evander regrets that the frailty of old age keeps him from fighting at Aeneas&#x27;s side, and reminisces about the warrior deeds of his youth:

No other literary source mentions Erulus; he may be Vergil&#x27;s pure invention, based on the mythological figure Geryon, or given that his mother&#x27;s cult is represented only sparsely in literary sources, he may belong to an archaic tradition to which no other reference survives. Some scholars have seen Erulus as an influence on Spenser&#x27;s conception of Triamond&#x27;s three-fold life in &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;.

<doc id="85373" wikidata="Q290298" url="?curid=85373" title="Honos">
<text>Honos () or Honor () was the Roman god personifying honor. He was closely associated with Virtus, the goddess of manliness, or bravery, and the two are frequently depicted together. Honos is typically shown wearing a chaplet of bay leaves, while Virtus is identified by her helmet.

In 234 BC, Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus dedicated a temple to Honos just outside the Porta Capena, one of Rome&#x27;s principal gates, following his victory over the Ligures. Twelve years later, after Marcus Claudius Marcellus defeated and slew the Gallic king, Viridomarus, at the Battle of Clastidium, to win the &quot;spolia opima&quot;, he vowed a temple to Honos and Virtus. He renewed this vow after capturing Syracuse in 212 BC, during the Second Punic War, and while consul in 208 he attempted to fulfill it by rededicating the existing temple in the name of both gods. The College of Pontiffs refused to allow this, so Marcellus restored the temple of Honos, and built a second, adjoining shrine to Virtus, making a double temple. Marcellus was slain in an ambush near Venusia later that year, so the temple was dedicated by his son in 205. It was richly adorned with treasures that Marcellus had brought from Syracuse, although many of these disappeared over the next two centuries. The temple was restored by Vespasian, and was still standing in the fourth century AD.

Another temple to Honos and Virtus was built by Gaius Marius during his fifth consulship in 101 BC, using the spoils he had captured from the Cimbri and the Teutones. The shrine was probably built on the slopes of the Capitoline Hill, and Vitruvius praises the work of its architect, Gaius Mucius. It was here that the Roman Senate voted to recall Cicero from exile in 57 BC.

<doc id="85374" wikidata="Q1115859" url="?curid=85374" title="Horatius Cocles">
<text>Publius Horatius Cocles was an officer in the army of the early Roman Republic who famously defended the Pons Sublicius from the invading army of Etruscan King Lars Porsena of Clusium in the late 6th century BC, during the war between Rome and Clusium. By defending the narrow end of the bridge, he and his companions were able to hold off the attacking army long enough to allow other Romans to destroy the bridge behind him, blocking the Etruscans&#x27; advance and saving the city.

==Background==
Horatius was a member of the ancient patrician house of the Horatii, celebrated in legend since the combat between the Horatii and the Curiatii in the time of Tullus Hostilius, the third Roman king. He was a nephew of the consul, Marcus Horatius Pulvillus, and is said to have obtained his agnomen, &quot;Cocles&quot;, meaning &quot;one-eyed&quot;, because he lost an eye in the Battle of the Sublician Bridge. However, this may be a later elaboration, as the famous statue of Horatius, lame and one-eyed, which was still visible, though heavily weathered, in the time of Pliny the Elder, was probably intended as a depiction of the god Vulcan, and only became identified with Horatius when its original subject was no longer recognizable.

In 509 BC, King Lars Porsena was at the head of an army that marched on Rome. Concentrating his forces on the Etruscan (west) side of the Tiber, Porsena assaulted Janiculum hill and seized it and all its materiel from the terrified Roman guard. Porsena left an Etruscan garrison to hold it, then proceeded towards the Pons Sublicius, the only regional bridge across the Tiber. The Romans awaited in the Naevian Meadow between Porsena and the bridge. The Tarquins commanded the Etruscan left wing facing the Roman troops of Spurius Larcius and Titus Herminius. Octavius Mamilius commanded the Etruscan right wing consisting of rebel Latins; they faced Romans under Marcus Valerius Volusus and Titus Lucretius Tricipitinus. Porsena commanded the center, facing the two Roman consuls. Porsena had the Romans outnumbered and intended to intimidate them into retreat.

Battle ensued. The Etruscan right wing was successful in wounding Valerius and Lucretius, the commanders of the Roman left wing. After both were carried off the field, the Romans began to panic and ran for the bridge. The enemy pursued.

==Horatius at the bridge==
Three Romans now defended the Pons Sublicius; the right wing&#x27;s commanders Spurius Larcius and Titus Herminius Aquilinus, plus Publius Horatius Cocles, a junior officer &quot;on guard at the bridge when he saw the Janiculum taken by a sudden assault and the enemy rushing down from it to the river ...&quot;

The three defenders withstood sword and missile attacks until the Roman troops had all crossed.

Livy&#x27;s briefer and more skeptical account tells of no battle, only that Horatius&#x27; &quot;own men, a panic-struck mob, were deserting their posts and throwing away their arms&quot;; however, Horatius&#x27; courage manages to shame the two veteran commanders, Herminius and Lartius, to assist him momentarily with his defense of the bridge.

Dionysius&#x27; account explains, &quot;Herminius and Lartius, their defensive arms being now rendered useless by the continual blows they received, began to retreat gradually.&quot; They order Horatius to retreat with them, but he stood his ground. Understanding the threat to Rome if the enemy were to cross the river, he ordered his men to destroy the bridge. The enemy was shocked not only by Horatius&#x27; suicidal last stand, but also by his decision to use a pile of bodies as a shield wall. Horatius was struck by enemy missiles many times including a spear in the buttocks. Hearing word from his men they&#x27;d torn up the bridge, he &quot;leaped fully armed into the river and swimming across ... he emerged upon the shore without having lost any of his weapons.&quot;

Livy&#x27;s version has him uttering this prayer to Father Tiber: &quot;Tiberinus, holy father, I pray thee to receive into thy propitious stream these arms and this thy warrior.&quot;

Horatius was awarded a crown for his valor (akin to a modern military decoration) and conducted into the city by a singing crowd joined by a grateful city. Horatius was now disabled and so could no longer serve in the army or hold public office, but he was provided &quot;as much of the public land as he himself could plow around in one day with a yoke of oxen,&quot; and each citizen of Rome was obligated to give him one day&#x27;s ration of food. He would also be honoured with a bronze statue in the comitium.

Polybius&#x27; account uses Horatius as an example of the men who have &quot;devoted themselves to inevitable death...to save the lives of other citizens...[H]e threw himself into the river with his armor, and there lost his life as he had designed.&quot;

==Aftermath==
Horatius&#x27; defense stymied Lars Porsena&#x27;s direct assault on the city walls, forcing him into a siege. The siege would conclude with a peace treaty, leaving Rome intact.

==Skeptical points of view==
The story of Horatius at the Bridge appears in many ancient sources, including Plutarch, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and Livy. Florus tacitly acknowledges the extraordinary nature of the story: &quot;It was on this occasion that those three prodigies and marvels of Rome made their appearance, Horatius, Mucius and Cloelia, who, were they not recorded in our annals, would seem fabulous characters at the present day.&quot; Tacitus notes in passing that &quot;when [Rome] was surrendered, [Lars Porsena] did not violate the seat of Jupiter&quot; (Rome&#x27;s most important temple). This could be understood to mean that Rome surrendered during or after this battle.

Livy viewed the story as legendary, dubious of Horatius&#x27; fully armed swim, noting &quot;though many missiles fell over him he swam across in safety to his friends, an act of daring more famous than credible with posterity.&quot;

T.J. Cornell deems these various accounts invented by &quot;unscrupulous annalists&quot; as &quot;face-saving victories in the immediate aftermath of these defeats&quot;, insisting &quot;The annalists of the first century BC are thus seen principally as entertainers...&quot;

== Later uses of the theme ==

The story of the redoubtable Horatius at the Bridge began to be depicted in art during the Renaissance, but was never an especially popular theme. It tended to be shown by artists who favored recondite classical stories, and appear in the minor arts, such as plaquettes and maiolica.

Napoleon, after the battle of Klausen, nicknamed General Thomas-Alexandre Dumas &quot;The Horatius Cocles of Tyrol&quot; for his solo defense of a bridge over the River Eisack.

The story of &quot;Horatius at the Bridge&quot; is retold in verse in the poem &quot;&quot; in &quot;Lays of Ancient Rome&quot; by Thomas Babington Macaulay, which enjoyed great popularity in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The details of the poem often vary from the traditional tale by poetic license. Winston Churchill wrote that while he &quot;stagnated in the lowest form&quot; at Harrow, he gained a prize open to the whole school by reciting the whole &quot;twelve hundred lines&quot; of &quot;Horatius&quot;. A biographical film about Churchill, &quot;Into the Storm&quot; (2009), begins with the much older Churchill reciting from &quot;Horatius&quot;: &quot;And how can man die better, than facing fearful odds, for the ashes of his fathers, and the temples of his gods.&quot; Later in the film, the same verses feature prominently in a nostalgic and morose address Churchill delivers to his war cabinet. Churchill also recites from &quot;Horatius&quot; in a scene from the biographical film &quot;Darkest Hour&quot;, and these lines occur in numerous works of fiction.

&quot;A Nation Once Again&quot; was a popular Irish rebel song, written in the early to mid-1840s by Thomas Osborne Davis (1814–1845) in furtherance of Irish nationalism. First published in &quot;The Nation&quot; on 13 July 1844 (two years after Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;Horatius&quot;), the first verse refers to the heroism of &quot;ancient freemen, For Greece and Rome who bravely stood, three hundred men and three men&quot;, references the three hundred Spartans at Thermopylae, and the three defenders at the Pons Sublicius.

Horatius figures prominently in Jessie Pope&#x27;s 1915 poem &quot;The Longest Odds&quot; about the exploits of a who single-handedly clears an entire German trench before being killed. His actions are likewise compared to both the Spartans and the Roman defenders.

The story of Horatius is echoed in a poem about Sven Dufva, &quot;The Tales of Ensign Stål,&quot; recounting the story of a simple-minded but honest and dutiful soldier in the Finnish War who heroically holds back an attack by Russian forces at a bridge by himself, but dies in the effort.

In the 2013 film &quot;Oblivion&quot;, the protagonist paraphrases Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;Horatius&quot;, and quotes many parts of the poem before confronting an overwhelming enemy.

<doc id="85378" wikidata="Q743194" url="?curid=85378" title="The Winter's Tale">
<text>The Winter&#x27;s Tale is a play by William Shakespeare originally published in the First Folio of 1623. Although it was grouped among the comedies, many modern editors have relabelled the play as one of Shakespeare&#x27;s late romances. Some critics consider it to be one of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;problem plays&quot; because the first three acts are filled with intense psychological drama, while the last two acts are comic and supply a happy ending.

The play has been intermittently popular, having been revived in productions and adaptations by some of the leading theatre practitioners in Shakespearean performance history. In the mid-18th century, after a long interval without major performances, David Garrick premiered his adaptation &quot;Florizel and Perdita&quot; (first performed in 1753 and published in 1756). &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; was revived again in the 19th century, when the fourth &quot;pastoral&quot; act was widely popular. In the second half of the 20th century, &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; was often performed in its entirety, drawn largely from the First Folio text, with varying degrees of success.

== Synopsis ==

Following a brief introductory scene, the play begins with the appearance of two childhood friends: Leontes, King of Sicily, and Polixenes, the King of Bohemia. Polixenes is visiting the kingdom of Sicily, and is enjoying catching up with his old friend. However, after nine months, Polixenes yearns to return to his own kingdom to tend to affairs and see his son. Leontes cannot persuade Polixenes to stay longer, so he decides to send his wife, Queen Hermione, to try to convince him. Hermione agrees and with three short speeches is successful. Leontes is surprised that Hermione could convince Polixenes so easily, so he begins to suspect that his pregnant wife has been having an affair with the other king. Leontes orders Camillo, a Sicilian lord, to poison Polixenes. Camillo instead warns Polixenes and they both flee to Bohemia.

Furious at their escape, Leontes publicly accuses his wife of infidelity and declares that the child she is bearing must be Polixenes&#x27; bastard. He throws her in prison, over the protests of his nobles, and sends two of his lords, Cleomenes and Dion, to the Oracle at Delphos for confirmation of his suspicions. Meanwhile, the queen gives birth to a girl, and her loyal friend Paulina takes the baby to the king, hoping that the sight of the child will soften his heart. He grows angrier, however, and orders Paulina&#x27;s husband, Lord Antigonus, to take the child and abandon it in a desolate place. Cleomenes and Dion return from Delphos with word from the Oracle and find Hermione on trial, asserting her innocence. The Oracle states categorically that Hermione and Polixenes are innocent, that Camillo is an honest man, and that Leontes will have no heir until his lost daughter is found. Leontes refuses to believe the oracle, but soon learns that his son Mamillius has died of a wasting sickness brought on by the accusations against his mother. At this, Hermione falls in a swoon and is carried away by Paulina, who subsequently reports the queen&#x27;s death to her heartbroken and repentant husband. Leontes vows to spend the rest of his days atoning for the loss of his son, his abandoned daughter, and his queen.

Antigonus, meanwhile, abandons the baby on the coast of Bohemia, reporting that Hermione appeared to him in a dream and bade him name the girl Perdita. He leaves a fardel (a bundle) by the baby containing gold and other trinkets to suggest that the baby is of noble blood. A violent storm suddenly appears, wrecking the ship on which Antigonus arrived. He wishes to take pity on the child, but he is chased away in one of Shakespeare&#x27;s most famous stage directions: &quot;Exit, pursued by a bear.&quot; Perdita is rescued by a shepherd and his son, also known as &quot;Clown&quot;.
&quot;Time&quot; enters and announces the passage of sixteen years. Camillo, now in the service of Polixenes, begs the Bohemian king to allow him to return to Sicily. Polixenes refuses and reports to Camillo that his son, Prince Florizel, has fallen in love with a lowly shepherd girl, Perdita. He suggests to Camillo that they disguise themselves and attend the sheep-shearing feast where Florizel and Perdita will be betrothed. At the feast, hosted by the Old Shepherd (who has prospered thanks to the gold in the fardel), the pedlar Autolycus picks the pocket of the Young Shepherd and, in various guises, entertains the guests with bawdy songs and the trinkets he sells. Polixenes and Camillo watch, disguised, as Florizel (under the guise of a shepherd named Doricles) and Perdita are betrothed. Polixenes tears off his disguise and intervenes, threatening the Old Shepherd and Perdita with torture and death and ordering his son never to see the shepherd&#x27;s daughter again. Camillo, still longing for his native land, schemes to send Florizel and Perdita to Sicily, so that Polixenes will bring him along when he pursues them. The lovers take ship for Sicily, as do the two shepherds and Autolycus.

In Sicily, Leontes is still in mourning. Cleomenes and Dion plead with him to end his time of repentance because the kingdom needs an heir. Paulina, however, convinces the king to remain unmarried forever, since no woman can match the greatness of his lost Hermione. Florizel and Perdita arrive and are greeted effusively by Leontes. Florizel pretends to be on a diplomatic mission from his father, but his cover is blown when Polixenes and Camillo, too, arrive in Sicilia. The meeting and reconciliation of the kings and princes is reported by gentlemen of the Sicilian court: how the Old Shepherd raised Perdita, how Antigonus met his end, how Leontes was overjoyed at being reunited with his daughter, and how he begged Polixenes for forgiveness. The Old Shepherd and Young Shepherd, now made gentlemen by the kings, meet Autolycus, who asks them for their forgiveness for his roguery. Leontes, Polixenes, Camillo, Florizel and Perdita then go to Paulina&#x27;s house in the country, where a statue of Hermione has been recently finished. The sight of his wife&#x27;s form makes Leontes distraught, but then, to everyone&#x27;s amazement, the statue shows signs of vitality: it is Hermione, miraculously restored to life—or simply having lived in seclusion with Paulina for the last sixteen years. As the play ends, Perdita and Florizel are engaged, and the whole company celebrates the miracle. Despite this happy ending typical of Shakespeare&#x27;s comedies and romances, the impression of the unjust death of young prince Mamillius lingers to the end, which, combined with the years wasted in separation, brings an element of unredeemed tragedy to the play.

== Sources ==
The main plot of &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; is taken from Robert Greene&#x27;s pastoral romance &quot;Pandosto&quot;, published in 1588. Shakespeare&#x27;s changes to the plot are uncharacteristically slight, especially in light of the romance&#x27;s undramatic nature, and Shakespeare&#x27;s fidelity to it gives &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; its most distinctive feature: the sixteen-year gap between the third and fourth acts. This distinctive feature violates the Classical Unities, a set of principles for dramatic tragedies that was introduced in 16th-century Italy based on the work of Aristotle.

There are changes in names, places, and minor plot details, but the largest changes lie in the survival and reconciliation of Hermione and Leontes (Greene&#x27;s Pandosto) at the end of the play. The character equivalent to Hermione in &quot;Pandosto&quot; dies after being accused of adultery, while Leontes&#x27; equivalent looks back upon his deeds (including an incestuous fondness for his daughter) and slays himself. The survival of Hermione, while presumably intended to create the last scene&#x27;s involving the statue, creates a distinctive thematic divergence from &quot;Pandosto&quot;. Greene follows the usual ethos of Hellenistic romance, in which the return of a lost prince or princess restores order and provides a sense of humour and closure that evokes Providence&#x27;s control. Shakespeare, by contrast, sets in the foreground the restoration of the older, indeed aged, generation, in the reunion of Leontes and Hermione. Leontes not only lives, but seems to insist on the happy ending of the play.

It has been suggested that the use of a pastoral romance from the 1590s indicates that at the end of his career, Shakespeare felt a renewed interest in the dramatic contexts of his youth. Minor influences also suggest such an interest. As in &quot;Pericles&quot;, he uses a chorus to advance the action in the manner of the naive dramatic tradition; the use of a bear in the scene on the Bohemian seashore is almost certainly indebted to &quot;Mucedorus&quot;, a chivalric romance revived at court around 1610.

Eric Ives, the biographer of Anne Boleyn (1986), believes that the play is meant to parallel the fall of that queen, who was beheaded on false charges of adultery on the orders of her husband Henry VIII in 1536. There are numerous parallels between the two stories – including the fact that one of Henry&#x27;s closest friends, Sir Henry Norreys, was beheaded as one of Anne&#x27;s supposed lovers and refused to confess in order to save his life, claiming that everyone knew the Queen was innocent. If this theory is followed, then Perdita becomes a dramatic representation of Anne&#x27;s only daughter, Queen Elizabeth I.

== Date and text ==

The play was not published until the First Folio of 1623. In spite of tentative early datings (see below), most critics believe the play is one of Shakespeare&#x27;s later works, possibly written in 1610 or 1611. A 1611 date is suggested by an apparent connection with Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Masque of Oberon&quot;, performed at Court 1 January 1611, in which appears a dance of ten or twelve satyrs; &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; includes a dance of twelve men costumed as satyrs, and the servant announcing their entry says &quot;one three of them, by their own report, sir, hath danc&#x27;d before the King.&quot; (IV.iv.337–338). Arden Shakespeare editor J.H.P. Pafford found that &quot;the language, style, and spirit of the play all point to a late date. The tangled speech, the packed sentences, speeches which begin and end in the middle of a line, and the high percentage of light and weak endings are all marks of Shakespeare&#x27;s writing at the end of his career. But of more importance than a verse test is the similarity of the last plays in spirit and themes.&quot;

In the late 18th century, Edmond Malone suggested that a &quot;book&quot; listed in the &quot;Stationers&#x27; Register&quot; on 22 May 1594, under the title &quot;a Wynters nightes pastime&quot;, might have been Shakespeare&#x27;s, though no copy of it is known. In 1933, Dr. Samuel A. Tannenbaum wrote that Malone subsequently &quot;seems to have assigned it to 1604; later still, to 1613; and finally he settled on 1610–11. Hunter assigned it to about 1605.&quot;

==Analysis and criticism==

=== Title of the play ===
A play called &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; would immediately indicate to contemporary audiences that the work would present an &quot;idle tale&quot;, an old wives&#x27; tale not intended to be realistic, and that it would offer the promise of a happy ending. The title may have been inspired by George Peele&#x27;s play &quot;The Old Wives&#x27; Tale&quot; of 1590, in which a storyteller tells &quot;a merry winter&#x27;s tale&quot; of a missing daughter. Early in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, the royal heir, Mamillius, warns that &quot;a sad tale&#x27;s best for winter&quot;. His mother is soon put on trial for treason and adulteryand his death is announced seconds after she is shown to have been faithful and Leontes&#x27;s accusations unfounded.

=== Debates ===

==== The statue ====

While the language Paulina uses in the final scene evokes the sense of a magical ritual through which Hermione is brought back to life, there are several passages which suggest a far likelier case – that Paulina hid Hermione at a remote location to protect her from Leontes&#x27; wrath and that the re-animation of Hermione does not derive from any magic. The Steward announces that the members of the court have gone to Paulina&#x27;s dwelling to see the statue; Rogero offers this exposition: &quot;I thought she had some great matter there in hand, for she [Paulina] hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione, visited that removed house&quot; (5.2. 102–105). Further, Leontes is surprised that the statue is &quot;so much wrinkled&quot;, unlike the Hermione he remembers. Paulina answers his concern by claiming that the age-progression attests to the &quot;carver&#x27;s excellence&quot;, which makes her look &quot;as [if] she lived now&quot;. Hermione later asserts that her desire to see her daughter allowed her to endure 16 years of separation: &quot;thou shalt hear that I, / Knowing by Paulina that the oracle / Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved / Myself to see the issue&quot; (5.3.126–129).

However, the action of 3.2 calls into question the &quot;rational&quot; explanation that Hermione was spirited away and sequestered for 16 years. Hermione swoons upon the news of Mamillius&#x27; death, and is rushed from the room. Paulina returns after a short monologue from Leontes, bearing the news of Hermione&#x27;s death. After some discussion, Leontes demands to be led toward the bodies of his wife and son: &quot;Prithee, bring me / To the dead bodies of my queen and son: / One grave shall be for both: upon them shall / The causes of their death appear, unto / Our shame perpetual&quot; (3.2). Paulina seems convinced of Hermione&#x27;s death, and Leontes&#x27; order to visit both bodies and see them interred is never called into question by later events in the play.

==== The seacoast of Bohemia ====

Shakespeare&#x27;s fellow playwright Ben Jonson ridiculed the presence in the play of a seacoast and a desert in Bohemia, since the landlocked Kingdom of Bohemia (corresponding to the western part of the modern-day Czech Republic) had neither a coast nor a desert. Shakespeare followed his source (Robert Greene&#x27;s &quot;Pandosto&quot;) in giving Bohemia a coast, though he reversed the location of characters and events: &quot;The part of Pandosto of Bohemia is taken by Leontes of Sicily, that of Egistus of Sicily by Polixenes of Bohemia&quot;. In support of Greene and Shakespeare, it has been pointed out that for a brief period in the 13th century, the territories ruled by Ottokar II of Bohemia did stretch to the Adriatic, even though Bohemia strictly speaking did not; so that if one takes &quot;Bohemia&quot; to mean all of the territories ruled by Ottokar II, it would have been possible to sail from Sicily to the &quot;seacoast of Bohemia&quot;. Jonathan Bate offers the simple explanation that the court of King James was politically allied with that of Rudolf II, and the characters and dramatic roles of the rulers of Sicily and Bohemia were reversed for reasons of political sensitivity, and in particular to allow it to be performed at the wedding of the Princess Elizabeth.

In 1891, Edmund Oscar von Lippmann pointed out that &quot;Bohemia&quot; was also a rare name for Apulia in southern Italy. More influential was Thomas Hanmer&#x27;s 1744 argument that Bohemia is a printed error for Bithynia, an ancient nation in Asia Minor; this theory was adopted in Charles Kean&#x27;s influential 19th-century production of the play, which featured a resplendent Bithynian court. At the time of the medieval Kingdom of Sicily, however, Bithynia was long extinct and its territories were controlled by the Byzantine Empire. On the other hand, the play alludes to Hellenistic antiquity (e.g. the Oracle of Delphos, the names of the kings), so that the &quot;Kingdom of Sicily&quot; may refer to Greek Sicily, not to the Kingdom of Sicily of later medieval times. This is irreconcilably contradicted by Hermione&#x27;s identity as a princess of Russia, a country that did not exist in the classical period.

The pastoral genre is not known for precise verisimilitude, and, like the assortment of mixed references to ancient religion and contemporary religious figures and customs, this possible inaccuracy may have been included to underscore the play&#x27;s fantastical and chimeric quality. As Andrew Gurr puts it, Bohemia may have been given a seacoast &quot;to flout geographical realism, and to underline the unreality of place in the play&quot;.

A theory explaining the existence of the seacoast in Bohemia offered by C. H. Herford is suggested in Shakespeare&#x27;s chosen title of the play. A winter&#x27;s tale is something associated with parents telling children stories of legends around a fireside: by using this title, it implies to the audience that these details should not be taken too seriously.

John A. Pitcher argues in the Arden Shakespeare Third Series edition (2010) that the coast of Bohemia is intended as a joke, akin to jokes about a &quot;Swiss Navy&quot;.

In the novel &quot;Prince Otto&quot; by Robert Louis Stevenson reference is made to the land of Seaboard Bohemia in the context of an obvious parody of Shakespeare&#x27;s apparent liberties with geography in the play.

====The Isle of Delphos====
Likewise, Shakespeare&#x27;s apparent mistake of placing the Oracle of Delphi on a small island has been used as evidence of Shakespeare&#x27;s limited education. However, Shakespeare again copied this locale directly from &quot;Pandosto&quot;. Moreover, the erudite Robert Greene was not in error, as the Isle of Delphos does not refer to Delphi, but to the Cycladic island of Delos, the mythical birthplace of Apollo, which from the 15th to the late 17th century in England was known as &quot;Delphos&quot;. Greene&#x27;s source for an Apollonian oracle on this island likely was the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, in which Virgil wrote that Priam consulted the Oracle of Delos before the outbreak of the Trojan War and that Aeneas after escaping from Troy consulted the same Delian oracle regarding his future.

==== The bear ====
The play contains the most famous of Shakespearean stage directions: &quot;Exit, pursued by a bear&quot;, presaging the offstage death of Antigonus. It is not known whether Shakespeare used a real bear from the London bear-pits or an actor in bear costume. The Admiral&#x27;s Men, the rival playing company to the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men during the 1590s, are reported to have possessed &quot;j beares skyne&quot; among their stage properties in a surviving inventory dated March 1598. Perhaps a similar prop was later used by Shakespeare&#x27;s company.

== Performance history ==
===Shakespeare&#x27;s day to the Restoration===
The earliest recorded performance of the play was recorded by Simon Forman, the Elizabethan &quot;figure caster&quot; or astrologer, who noted in his journal on 11 May 1611 that he saw &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; at the Globe playhouse. The play was then performed in front of King James at Court on 5 November 1611. The play was also acted at Whitehall during the festivities preceding Princess Elizabeth&#x27;s marriage to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, on 14 February 1613. Later Court performances occurred on 7 April 1618, 18 January 1623 and 16 January 1634. It was not revived during the Restoration, unlike many other Shakespearean plays.

===18th and 19th century===
&quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; was performed in 1741 at Goodman&#x27;s Fields Theatre and in 1742 at Covent Garden. Adaptations, titled &quot;The Sheep-Shearing&quot; and &quot;Florizal and Perdita&quot;, were acted at Covent Garden in 1754 and at Drury Lane in 1756. Notable stagings in the 19th century included those featuring John Philip Kemble in 1811, Samuel Phelps in 1845 and Charles Kean in an 1856 production that was famous for its elaborate sets and costumes. Johnston Forbes-Robertson played Leontes memorably in 1887.

===20th century===
Herbert Beerbohm Tree took on the role of Leontes in 1906. The longest-running Broadway production starred Henry Daniell and Jessie Royce Landis and ran for 39 performances in 1946. One of the best remembered modern productions was staged by Peter Brook in London in 1951 and starred John Gielgud as Leontes. In the Guthrie Theater&#x27;s 1976-1977 season, Michael Langham directed a Minneapolis production with Ken Ruta as Leontes and Helen Carey as Hermione; also featuring Barbara Bryne, Tony Mockus, Mark Lamos and Oliver Cliff. In 1980, David Jones, a former associate artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, chose to launch his new theatre company at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) with &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; starring Brian Murray supported by Jones&#x27; new company at BAM In 1983, the Riverside Shakespeare Company mounted a production based on the First Folio text at The Shakespeare Center in Manhattan. In 1993 Adrian Noble won a Globe Award for Best Director for his Royal Shakespeare Company adaptation, which then was successfully brought to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1994. In 1997, a production at Boise State University was directed by Gordon Reinhart and starred Ira Amyx, James B. Fisk, Richard Klautsch and Randy Davison as Polixenes.

===21st century===
In 2009, four separate productions were staged.Sam Mendes inaugurated his transatlantic &quot;Bridge Project&quot; directing &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; with a cast featuring Simon Russell Beale (Leontes), Rebecca Hall (Hermione), Ethan Hawke (Autolycus), Sinéad Cusack (Paulina), and Morven Christie (Perdita). The Royal Shakespeare Company mounted the show. Theatre Delicatessen also staged productions of &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; in 2009. The play is in the repertory of the Stratford Festival of Canada and was seen at the New York Shakespeare Festival, Central Park, in 2010. Last, the Hudson Shakespeare Company of New Jersey presented a production as part of their annual Shakespeare in the Parks series, set in central Europe during the early 1900s era of the Austro-Hungarian Empire but with a decidedly diverse cast. African American actors Tony White played Leontes, Deirdre Ann Johnson played Hermione, and Monica Jones in a dual role of Mamillius and Perdita. Angela Liao appeared as Paulina.

In 2013, the RSC staged a new production directed by Lucy Bailey, starring Jo Stone-Fewings as Leontes and Tara Fitzgerald as Hermione. This production premiered at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre on 24 January 2013.

In 2015, the Kenneth Branagh Production company staged the play at the Garrick Theatre, with simultaneous broadcast to cinemas. The production featured Kenneth Branagh as Leontes, Judi Dench as Paulina, and Miranda Raison as Hermione. The same year, Cheek by Jowl staged the play, directed by Declan Donnellan and designed by Nick Ormerod. The production toured globally, including to France, Spain, the US and Russia, and was livestreamed around the world in a partnership with the BBC and Riverside Studios.

In 2017, The Public Theatre Mobile Unit staged the play, directed by Lee Sunday Evans. In 2018, Theatre for a New Audience staged the play Off-Broadway, directed by Arin Arbus with Kelley Curran as Hermione and Anatol Yusef as Leontes.

In 2018, the play was also performed at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe, in London. The Globe staged it again in 2023, in a production where the audience walked between the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse (where the Sicilian scenes were staged) and the main Globe Theatre (where the Bohemian scenes were staged).

Also in 2023, Empty Space Productions and The University of New England staged a production in Armidale, Australia. The Folger Theatre in Washington, DC staged a production directed by Tamilla Wodard that fall as the first play shown in the Theatre after its multi-year, multimillion-dollar renovation.

The play was performed at Boston&#x27;s &quot;Shakespeare on the Common&quot; for Commonwealth Shakespeare Company in July and August, 2024, and was directed by Bryn Boice.

== Adaptations ==
There have been numerous film versions, including a 1910 silent film, a 1961 television film starring Robert Shaw, and a 1967 version starring Laurence Harvey as Leontes. An &quot;orthodox&quot; BBC production was televised in 1981. It was produced by Jonathan Miller, directed by Jane Howell and starred Robert Stephens as Polixenes and Jeremy Kemp as Leontes.

Choreographer Christopher Wheeldon created a full-length ballet, with music by Joby Talbot, based on the play. The ballet is a co-production between The Royal Ballet and National Ballet of Canada, and premiered in Royal Opera House in London in 2014.

In 2015, author Jeanette Winterson published the book &quot;The Gap of Time&quot;, a modern adaptation of &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;. In 2016, author E. K. Johnston published &quot;Exit, Pursued by a Bear&quot;, another modern adaption.

On 1 May 2016, BBC Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;Drama on 3&quot; broadcast an audio production directed by David Hunter, with Danny Sapani as Leontes, Eve Best as Hermione, Shaun Dooley as Polixenes, Karl Johnson as Camillo, Susan Jameson as Paulina, Paul Copley as the Shepherd and Faye Castelow as Perdita.

An opera by Ryan Wigglesworth, based on the play, was premiered at the English National Opera on 27 February 2017.

In 2021 Melbourne Shakespeare Company produced an abridged musical production directed by Jennifer Sarah Dean at Central Park in Melbourne.

<text>The Heysel Plateau (; ) or Heysel Park (; ), usually shortened to Heysel () or Heizel (), is a neighbourhood, park and exhibition space in Laeken, in the north-west of the City of Brussels, Belgium, where the Brussels International Exposition of 1935 and the 1958 Brussels World&#x27;s Fair (Expo 58) took place.

The Atomium, a symbolic modernist structure, originally built for Expo 58, is the most impressive monument on the Heysel Plateau and is now considered a landmark of Brussels. Opposite it, the Centenary Palace is one of the lasting remaining buildings of the 1935 World&#x27;s Fair. It was also the venue for the 32nd Eurovision Song Contest in 1987. Currently, it is home to the Brussels Exhibition Centre (Brussels Expo), the city&#x27;s most important event complex in Belgium and the largest exhibition space in the Benelux.

The Heysel Plateau was also the location of the Heysel Stadium, Belgium&#x27;s former national stadium, originally built in 1930. After the Heysel Stadium disaster of 1985, which claimed the lives of 39 spectators at the European Cup final, it was demolished and in its place the more modern and secure King Baudouin Stadium was built. The Bruparck entertainment park (with among others Mini-Europe miniature park and Kinepolis cinema) and the Planetarium of the Royal Observatory of Belgium are also located there, as is the Palais 12/Paleis 12, a large and modern multiuse indoor arena with a maximum capacity of 15,000 people. This site is served by Heysel/Heizel metro station on line 6 of the Brussels Metro.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Heysel&quot; derives from the Dutch word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;meager pasture&quot; or &quot;hill&quot;. There is also evidence of a brook in the Middle Ages, the Heyselbeek, a tributary of the Molenbeek brook, formed from several sources on the heights of Osseghem. &quot;Heyssel&quot; is retained as a toponym on the Huvenne map of 1848 and in the &quot;Geographical Dictionary of Letter Posts of the Kingdom of Belgium&quot; of 1857.

The terms &quot;Heysel&quot; in French and &quot;Heizel&quot; in Dutch have in fact gradually imposed themselves to fairly broadly designate this district of Laeken, to the detriment of two other toponyms, which designate more precise parts of it: &quot;Hossegem Dries&quot; to the north-west, at the current location of Osseghem Park, and &quot;Kauwenberg&quot; to the south-east, around the Chapel of St. Anna.

==History==

===Rural beginnings===
The Osseghem estate on the Heysel Plateau was first mentioned in the Early Middle Ages and may have been on the site of a former Roman villa. In 1152, a sale of the &quot;Hof van Ossegem&quot; by the heirs of Meinard van Brussel to Affligem Abbey is documented, which also included the old Church of Our Lady of Laeken. This church, whose origins date back to the 8th century, was located nearby, as was the Chapel of St. Anna with its miraculous spring, which attracted many pilgrims.

During the Ancien Régime, the Heysel Plateau was still largely owned by the Affligem fathers, and the area belonged to the parish of Laeken. At the height of the plateau were two other hamlets: Vleurgat (or Verregat) and Osseghem. The latter was found just south of today&#x27;s King Baudouin Stadium and gave its name to today&#x27;s Osseghem Park, while Vleurgat was further north, near the /, where the Vleurgat residential area is today.

In the 16th century, the Coensborgh Castle occupied an island on a pond formed by the Molenbeek. It was the property of the Meeûs family in the 17th century. In the 18th century, the beauty of the landscape motivated the construction of the Stuyvenberg Castle in 1725, the Palace of Schonenberg (today&#x27;s Royal Palace of Laeken) between 1782 and 1784, and the Belvédère Castle in 1788. The Ferraris map of 1777 does not show these first two castles but indicates the Osseghem farm, located a little south of the current King Baudouin Stadium. The Osseghem farm grew into a small village, which, in the 18th century, also included a &quot;Speelhuys&quot;, a pavilion where the Archbishop of Mechelen stayed when visiting Brussels.

Numerous quarries were also operated on the Heysel Plateau, which supplied the building material for, among other things, the Abbey Church of Affligem, the Church of Our Lady of Scherpenheuvel, the Jesuit Church in Antwerp and the Church of Our Lady of Finisterrae in central Brussels. Quarrying ceased towards the end of the 17th century, though traces can still be seen on the slopes to the east, in the Kattenberg and the depressions in Osseghem Park.

===19th-century urbanisation===
At the end of the 19th century, the Heysel still had a distinctly rural character, although there were already plans to develop it into a new urban area. In 1850, the Belgian Government authorised the construction of a new Church of Our Lady of Laeken, intended to replace the medieval building (destroyed except for its choir, which is still visible in the cemetery adjacent to the current church). King Leopold I himself laid the first stone in 1854, although the new church, much larger than the old one, was not completed until 1909. In 1869, a school was inaugurated in the hamlet, probably on the /. The Rue du Heysel itself was attested in an official document in 1875, and stretched between the / and the / (today&#x27;s /). The Villa Van der Borght was built in 1885 at the bottom of what is now the /, which was not yet laid out (the building will be razed in 1956), followed by the Church of St. Lambert around 1890.

Upon ascending to the throne, in 1865, King Leopold II was concerned with the construction of a memorial to his father in the perspective of the Royal Palace of Laeken. The development of a surrounding public park was approved in 1867. Laeken Park was gradually developed between 1876 and 1880 based on plans by the German landscape architect Édouard Keilig, associated with the civil engineer Louis Van Schoubroeck. The park and the monument were completed in 1880, in time for the 50th anniversary of Belgian independence. The king acquired more land on the Heysel in 1899. Plans to enlarge the Royal Palace lead to the demolition of the barracks located on its right flank, where a detachment of grenadiers, responsible since 1840 for the surveillance of the royal palaces, had been stationed. A new barracks was constructed between 1899 and 1902, in a Flemish neo-Renaissance style, according to the plans of the architect Jules-Jacques Van Ysendyck. The buildings are now made available by Belgium for the European School, Brussels IV. In 1905, the 75th anniversary of the country&#x27;s independence was celebrated with great fanfare, among others in Laeken Park. Later, the Institute of Agricultural Home Economics, a girls&#x27; school for agriculture and domestic science, was also set up in Osseghem.

===Later development (1920s–present)===
After the municipality of Laeken was annexed by the City of Brussels in 1921, the Belgian State transferred some of Leopold II&#x27;s former land to the city. Since the Parc du Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark had become too cramped, Brussels&#x27; authorities wished to develop the Heysel into a new exhibition and conference location of international stature for the Belgian capital. The Centenary Palace complex (, ) was designed by the architect Joseph Van Neck to house the 1935 World&#x27;s Fair. The Jubilee Stadium on the Heysel was completed in 1930 as part of the centenary celebrations of the Belgian Revolution. It was renamed the Heysel Stadium after the Second World War, and then the King Baudouin Stadium in 1995.

In the 1950s, the Heysel underwent another major change in preparation for the 1958 Brussels World&#x27;s Fair (Expo 58). On that occasion, 58 additional buildings were constructed, as well as the Atomium, a symbolic modernist structure by the architect André Waterkeyn. It consists of nine steel spheres connected by tubes, and forms a model of an iron crystal (specifically, a unit cell), magnified 165 billion times. Originally devoted to science, it would become a landmark of Brussels. Following the fair, most of the exhibition pavilions were gradually demolished, including a few, particularly emblematic, such as the Philips Pavilion by Le Corbusier and the &quot;Flèche du Génie civil&quot; sculpture, dynamited in 1970. The Atomium remains the main vestige of this period.

The Brussels Exhibition Centre (Brussels Expo) gradually expanded between 1977 and 1998 with the construction of the Palais/Paleis 11, the Palais/Paleis 12, and the Auditorium. It now has twelve halls, linked together by covered galleries, and currently occupies of land, making it the most important event complex in the city and the largest exhibition space in the Benelux. The year 1985 was marked by the Heysel Stadium disaster, a crowd disaster, which caused 39 deaths during the final of the European Cup. Since then, the stadium has been redeveloped and renamed the King Baudouin Stadium. That same year, the Heysel/Heizel metro station opened. In 1987, the 32nd Eurovision Song Contest was organised in the Centenary Palace.

==Future==

===Potential European Quarter===
The &quot;Heysel Project&quot; was a potential European Union (EU) &quot;quarter&quot; development in the Heysel. As part of that project, the area surrounding the Atomium would have become, on the long term, a location for some of the European Commission&#x27;s buildings, according to a draft project developed by the City of Brussels.

The City of Brussels had previously decided to allocate this area to &quot;infrastructures dedicated to the international vocation of Brussels&quot; and planned to erect a convention centre of &quot;international dimensions&quot; with a capacity of 3,500 seats and an &quot;important commercial centre.&quot; In January 2009, the Commission&#x27;s then-spokeswoman Valerie Rampi confirmed that the EU executive was considering several proposals for a new location, with some of office space. On 15 September 2008, a draft entitled &quot;Application file for the Heysel plain to host a new European quarter&quot; was issued.

According to the draft project, the Heysel was to host a new branch of the European School, where EU officials educate their children in their native tongues. This was made true in 2012 with the European School, Brussels IV&#x27;s move from Forest to its purpose built campus on the plateau. The area lies on a direct subway line connecting it to Brussels&#x27; current European Quarter. The existing parking facilities, the biggest in Belgium, were also presented as a plus, as well as the planned new residential area and the proximity of parks and leisure facilities. The European Quarter would have remained the centre of the Commission&#x27;s activities, but the body was also looking for &quot;additional poles outside&quot; this central area, in order to exert a downward pressure on real estate prices, according to Siim Kallas, the EU&#x27;s then-Commissioner for Administrative Affairs.

===&quot;Neo&quot; Project===
In 2009, a new project called &quot;Neo&quot; was launched to renovate the Heysel. This new plan provides for the construction of 590 housing units, a new shopping centre called &quot;Mall of Europe&quot; and a new amusement park, as well as a new sports park. The total cost is estimated at €1 billion. The town planning permit was issued and the project is scheduled for completion by 2030. On 16 October 2020, the then-mayor of the City of Brussels, Philippe Close, announced the definitive abandonment of part of the project, in particular the Congress Centre, but part of it, such as the mall, will remain.

<doc id="85381" wikidata="Q3088222" url="?curid=85381" title="Inuus">
<text>In ancient Roman religion, Inuus () was a god, or aspect of a god, who embodied sexual intercourse. The evidence for him as a distinct entity is scant. Maurus Servius Honoratus wrote that Inuus is an epithet of Faunus (Greek Pan), named from his habit of intercourse with animals, based on the etymology of &quot;ineundum&quot;, &quot;a going in, penetration,&quot; from &quot;&quot;, &quot;to enter&quot; in the sexual sense. Other names for the god were Fatuus and Fatuclus (with a short &quot;a&quot;).

Walter Friedrich Otto disputed the traditional etymology and derived &quot;Inuus&quot; instead from &quot;in-avos&quot;, &quot;friendly, beneficial&quot; (cf. &quot;aveo&quot;, &quot;to be eager for, desire&quot;), for the god&#x27;s fructifying power.

==Lupercalia==
Livy is the sole source for identifying Inuus as the form of Faunus for whom the Lupercalia was celebrated: &quot;naked young men would run around venerating Lycaean Pan, whom the Romans then called Inuus, with antics and lewd behavior.&quot; Although Ovid does not name Inuus in his treatment of the Lupercalia, he may allude to his sexual action in explaining the mythological background of the festival. When Romulus complains that a low fertility rate has rendered the abduction of the Sabine women pointless, Juno, in her guise as the birth goddess Lucina, offers an instruction: &quot;Let the sacred goat go into the Italian matrons&quot; (&quot;Italidas matres … sacer hirtus inito&quot;, with the verb &quot;inito&quot; a form of &quot;inire&quot;). The would-be mothers recoil from this advice, but an augur, &quot;recently arrived from Etruscan soil,&quot; offers a ritual dodge: a goat was killed, and its hide cut into strips for flagellating women who wished to conceive; thus the aetiology for the practice at the Lupercalia. Rutilius Namatianus offers a similar verbal play, &quot;Faunus init&quot; (&quot;Faunus enters&quot;), in pointing out a statue depicting the god at Castrum Inui (&quot;Fort Inuus&quot;). Georg Wissowa rejected both the etymology and the identification of Inuus with Faunus.

The scant evidence for Inuus has not been a bar to elaborate scholarly conjecture, as William Warde Fowler noted at the beginning of the 20th century in his classic work on Roman festivals. &quot;It is quite plain,&quot; Fowler observed, &quot;that the Roman of the literary age did not know who the god (of the Lupercalia) was.&quot;

==Castrum Inui==
Servius&#x27;s note on Inuus is prompted by the mention of &quot;Castrum Inui&quot; at &quot;Aeneid&quot; 6.775:

Castrum Novum is most likely Giulianova on the coast of Etruria, but Servius seems to have erred in thinking that Castrum Inui, on the coast of Latium, was the same town.

Rutilius makes the same identification as Servius but explains that there was a stone carving of Inuus over the gate of the town. This image, worn by time, showed horns on its &quot;pastoral forehead&quot;, but the ancient name was no longer legible. Rutilius is noncommittal about its identity, &quot;whether Pan exchanged Tyrrhenian woodlands for Maenala, or whether a resident Faunus enters &quot;(init)&quot; his paternal retreats,&quot; but proclaims that &quot;as long as he revitalizes the seed of mortals with generous fertility, the god is imagined as more than usually predisposed to sex.&quot;

==Other associations==
The Christian apologist Arnobius, in his extended debunking of traditional Roman deities, connects Inuus and Pales as guardians over flocks and herds. The woodland god Silvanus over time became identified with Faunus, and the unknown author of the &quot;Origo gentis romanae&quot; notes that many sources said that Faunus was the same as Silvanus, the god Inuus, and even Pan. Isidore of Seville identifies the &quot;Inui&quot;, plural, with Pan, incubi, and the Gallic Dusios.

Diomedes Grammaticus makes a surprising etymological association: he says that the son of the war goddess Bellona, Greek Enyo (Ἐνυώ), given in the genitive as Ἐνυοῦς (Enuous), is imagined by the poets as goat-foot Inuus, &quot;because in the manner of a goat he surmounts the mountaintops and difficult passes of the hills.&quot;

==Casuccini mirror==
An Etruscan bronze mirror from Chiusi (&quot;ca.&quot; 300 BCE), the so-called Casuccini mirror, may depict Inuus. The scene on the back is a type known from at least four other mirrors, as well as engraved Etruscan gems and Attic red-figure vases. It depicts the oracular head of Orpheus (Etruscan &quot;Urphe&quot;) prophesying to a group of figures. Names are inscribed around the edge of the mirror, but because the figures are not labeled individually, the correlation is not unambiguous; moreover, the lettering is of disputed legibility in some names. There is general agreement, however, given the comparative evidence, that the five central figures are &quot;Umaele&quot;, who seems to act as a medium; &quot;Euturpa&quot; (the Muse Euterpe), &quot;Inue&quot; (Inuus), &quot;Eraz&quot;, and &quot;Aliunea&quot; or &quot;Alpunea&quot; (Palamedes in other scenarios). The lovers in the pediment at the top are &quot;Atunis&quot; (Adonis) and the unknown &quot;E…ial&quot; where &quot;Turan&quot; (Venus) would be expected. The figure with outstretched wings on the tang is a &quot;Lasa&quot;, an Etruscan form of Lar who was a facilitator of love like the Erotes or Cupid.

The bearded Inuus appears in the center. Damage obscures his midsection and legs, but his left arm and chest are nude and muscled. On an otherwise very similar mirror, a spear-bearing youth replaces Inuus in the composition. No myth that would provide a narrative context for the scene has been determined.

==Darwinian connection==
Charles Darwin used the nomenclature &quot;Inuus ecaudatus&quot; in writing of the Barbary macaque, now classified as &quot;Macaca sylvanus&quot;. Charles Kingsley wrote to Darwin in January 1862 speculating that certain mythological beings may represent cultural memories of creatures &quot;intermediate between man &amp; the ape&quot; who became extinct as a result of natural selection:

<text>Italus or Italos (from ) was a legendary king of the Oenotrians, ancient people of Italic origin who inhabited the region now called Calabria, in southern Italy. In his &quot;Fabularum Liber&quot; (or &quot;Fabulae&quot;), Gaius Julius Hyginus recorded the myth that Italus was a son of Penelope and Telegonus (a son of Odysseus).

According to Aristotle (&quot;Politics&quot;) and Thucydides (&quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot;), Italus was the eponym of Italy (&quot;Italia&quot;). Aristotle, writing in the 4th century BCE, relates that, according to tradition, Italus converted the Oenotrians from a pastoral society to an agricultural one and gave them various ordinances, being the first to institute their system of common meals.

Writing centuries later, the Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus ( 60 BCE – after 7 BCE) in his &quot;Rhomaike Archaiologia&quot; (&quot;Antiquitates romanae&quot;, &quot;Roman Antiquities&quot;), cites Antiochus of Syracuse ( 420 BCE) for the information that Italus was an Oenotrian by birth and relates the tradition that Italia was named after him, as well as another account that derives the name &quot;Italia&quot; from a word for calf, an etymology also given by Timaeus, Varro,
and Festus.

<text>Atherosclerosis is a pattern of the disease arteriosclerosis, characterized by development of abnormalities called lesions in walls of arteries. This is a chronic inflammatory disease involving many different cell types and is driven by elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood. These lesions may lead to narrowing of the arterial walls due to buildup of atheromatous plaques. At the onset there are usually no symptoms, but if they develop, symptoms generally begin around middle age. In severe cases, it can result in coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or kidney disorders, depending on which body part(s) the affected arteries are located in the body.
The exact cause of atherosclerosis is unknown and is proposed to be multifactorial. Risk factors include abnormal cholesterol levels, elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers, high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking (both active and passive smoking), obesity, genetic factors, family history, lifestyle habits, and an unhealthy diet. Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, immune cells, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. The narrowing of arteries limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to parts of the body. Diagnosis is based upon a physical exam, electrocardiogram, and exercise stress test, among others.
Prevention guidelines include eating a healthy diet, exercising, not smoking, and maintaining normal body weight. Treatment of established atherosclerotic disease may include medications to lower cholesterol such as statins, blood pressure medication, and anticoagulant therapies to reduce the risk of blood clot formation. As the disease state progresses more invasive strategies are applied such as percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft, or carotid endarterectomy. Genetic factors are also strongly implicated in the disease process; it is unlikely to be entirely based on lifestyle choices.
Atherosclerosis generally starts when a person is young and worsens with age. Women are 78% at higher risk level than men Almost all people are affected to some degree by the age of 65. It is the number one cause of death and disability in developed countries. Though it was first described in 1575, there is evidence suggesting that this disease state is genetically inherent in the broader human population, with its origins tracing back to CMAH genetic mutations that may have occurred more than two million years ago during the evolution of hominin ancestors of modern human beings.
==Signs and symptoms==
Atherosclerosis is typically asymptomatic for decades because the arteries enlarge at all plaque locations, thus there is no effect on blood flow. Even most plaque ruptures do not produce symptoms until enough narrowing or closure of an artery, due to clots, occurs. Signs and symptoms only happen after severe narrowing or closure impedes blood flow to different organs enough to induce symptoms. Most of the time, patients realize that they have the disease only when they experience other cardiovascular disorders such as stroke or heart attack. These symptoms, however, still vary depending on which artery or organ is affected.

Early atherosclerotic processes likely begin in childhood. Fibrous and gelatinous lesions have been observed in the coronary arteries of children. Fatty streaks have been observed in the coronary arteries of juveniles. While coronary artery disease is more prevalent in men than women, atherosclerosis of the cerebral arteries and strokes equally affect both sexes.

Marked narrowing in the coronary arteries, which are responsible for bringing oxygenated blood to the heart, can produce symptoms such as chest pain of angina and shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, dizziness or lightheadedness, breathlessness or palpitations. Abnormal heart rhythms called arrhythmias—the heart beating either too slowly or too quickly—are another consequence of ischemia.

Carotid arteries supply blood to the brain and neck. Marked narrowing of the carotid arteries can present with symptoms such as a feeling of weakness; being unable to think straight; difficulty speaking; dizziness; difficulty in walking or standing up straight; blurred vision; numbness of the face, arms and legs; severe headache; and loss of consciousness. These symptoms are also related to stroke (death of brain cells). Stroke is caused by marked narrowing or closure of arteries going to the brain; lack of adequate blood supply leads to the death of the cells of the affected tissue.

Peripheral arteries, which supply blood to the legs, arms, and pelvis, also experience marked narrowing due to plaque rupture and clots. Symptoms of the narrowing are pain and numbness within the arms or legs. Another significant location for plaque formation is the renal arteries, which supply blood to the kidneys. Plaque occurrence and accumulation lead to decreased kidney blood flow and chronic kidney disease, which, like in all other areas, is typically asymptomatic until late stages.

In 2004, US data indicated that in ~66% of men and ~47% of women, the first symptom of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was a heart attack or sudden cardiac death (defined as death within one hour of onset of the symptom).

Case studies have included autopsies of U.S. soldiers killed in World War II and the Korean War. A much-cited report involved the autopsies of 300 U.S. soldiers killed in Korea. Although the average age of the men was 22.1 years, 77.3 percent had &quot;gross evidence of coronary arteriosclerosis&quot;.

==Risk factors==

The atherosclerotic process is not well understood. Atherosclerosis is associated with inflammatory processes in the endothelial cells of the vessel wall associated with retained low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. This retention may be a cause, an effect, or both, of the underlying inflammatory process.

The presence of the plaque induces the muscle cells of the blood vessel to stretch, compensating for the additional bulk. The endothelial lining then thickens, increasing the separation between the plaque and lumen. The thickening somewhat offsets the narrowing caused by the growth of the plaque, but moreover, it causes the wall to stiffen and become less compliant to stretching with each heartbeat.

=== Dietary ===
The relation between dietary fat and atherosclerosis is controversial. The USDA, in its food pyramid, promotes a diet of about 64% carbohydrates from total calories. The American Heart Association, the American Diabetes Association, and the National Cholesterol Education Program make similar recommendations. In contrast, Prof Walter Willett (Harvard School of Public Health, PI of the second Nurses&#x27; Health Study) recommends much higher levels of fat, especially of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat. These dietary recommendations reach a consensus, though, against consumption of trans fats.

The role of eating oxidized fats (rancid fats) in humans is not clear.
Rabbits fed rancid fats develop atherosclerosis faster. Rats fed DHA-containing oils experienced marked disruptions to their antioxidant systems, and accumulated significant amounts of phospholipid hydroperoxide in their blood, livers and kidneys.

Rabbits fed atherogenic diets containing various oils were found to undergo the most oxidative susceptibility of LDL via polyunsaturated oils. In another study, rabbits fed heated soybean oil &quot;grossly induced atherosclerosis and marked liver damage were histologically and clinically demonstrated.&quot; However, Fred Kummerow claims that it is not dietary cholesterol, but oxysterols, or oxidized cholesterols, from fried foods and smoking, that are the culprit.

Rancid fats and oils taste very unpleasant in even small amounts, so people avoid eating them.
Measuring or estimating the actual human consumption of these substances is challenging. Highly unsaturated omega-3 rich oils such as fish oil, when being sold in pill form, can hide the taste of oxidized or rancid fat that might be present. In the US, the health food industry&#x27;s dietary supplements are self-regulated and outside of FDA regulations. To protect unsaturated fats from oxidation, it is best to keep them cool and in oxygen-free environments.

== Pathophysiology ==

Atherogenesis is the developmental process of atheromatous plaques. It is characterized by a remodeling of arteries leading to subendothelial accumulation of fatty substances called plaques. The buildup of an atheromatous plaque is a slow process, developed over several years through a complex series of cellular events occurring within the arterial wall and in response to several local vascular circulating factors. One recent hypothesis suggests that, for unknown reasons, leukocytes, such as monocytes or basophils, begin to attack the endothelium of the artery lumen in cardiac muscle. The ensuing inflammation leads to the formation of atheromatous plaques in the arterial tunica intima, a region of the vessel wall located between the endothelium and the tunica media. Chronic inflammation within the arterial wall, driven by immune cells like macrophages, accelerates atherosclerotic plaque instability by promoting collagen breakdown and thinning the fibrous cap, which increases the likelihood of rupture and thrombosis. The bulk of these lesions is made of excess fat, collagen, and elastin. At first, as the plaques grow, only wall thickening occurs without narrowing. Stenosis is a late event, which may never happen and is often the result of repeated plaque rupture and healing responses, not just the atherosclerotic process. Autopsy studies have shown that the prevalence of coronary artery atherosclerosis in males from the United States, with an average age of 22.1 years old, who died in war, ranges from 45% to 77.3%.

=== Cellular ===

Early atherogenesis is characterized by the adherence of blood circulating monocytes (a type of white blood cell) to the vascular bed lining, the endothelium, then by their migration to the sub-endothelial space, and further activation into monocyte-derived macrophages. The primary documented driver of this process is oxidized lipoprotein particles within the wall, beneath the endothelial cells, though upper normal or elevated concentrations of blood glucose also plays a major role and not all factors are fully understood. Fatty streaks may appear and disappear.

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles in blood plasma invade the endothelium and become oxidized, creating risk of cardiovascular disease. A complex set of biochemical reactions regulates the oxidation of LDL, involving enzymes (such as Lp-LpA2) and free radicals in the endothelium.

Initial damage to the endothelium results in an inflammatory response. Monocytes enter the artery wall from the bloodstream, with platelets adhering to the area of insult. This may be promoted by redox signaling induction of factors such as VCAM-1, which recruits circulating monocytes, and M-CSF, which is selectively required for the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. The monocytes differentiate into macrophages, which proliferate locally, ingest oxidized LDL, slowly turning into large &quot;foam cells&quot; – so-called because of their changed appearance resulting from the numerous internal cytoplasmic vesicles and resulting high lipid content. Under the microscope, the lesion now appears as a fatty streak. Foam cells eventually die and further propagate the inflammatory process.

In addition to these cellular activities, there is also smooth muscle proliferation and migration from the tunica media into the intima in response to cytokines secreted by damaged endothelial cells. This causes the formation of a fibrous capsule covering the fatty streak. Intact endothelium can prevent this smooth muscle proliferation by releasing nitric oxide.

===Calcification and lipids===
Calcification forms among vascular smooth muscle cells of the surrounding muscular layer, specifically in the muscle cells adjacent to atheromas and on the surface of atheroma plaques and tissue. In time, as cells die, this leads to extracellular calcium deposits between the muscular wall and outer portion of the atheromatous plaques. With the atheromatous plaque interfering with the regulation of calcium deposition, it accumulates and crystallizes. A similar form of intramural calcification, presenting the picture of an early phase of arteriosclerosis, appears to be induced by many drugs that have an antiproliferative mechanism of action (Rainer Liedtke 2008).

Cholesterol is delivered into the vessel wall by cholesterol-containing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. To attract and stimulate macrophages, the cholesterol must be released from the LDL particles and oxidized, a key step in the ongoing inflammatory process. The process is worsened if it is insufficient high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the lipoprotein particle that removes cholesterol from tissues and carries it back to the liver.

The foam cells and platelets encourage the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, which in turn ingest lipids, become replaced by collagen, and transform into foam cells themselves. A protective fibrous cap normally forms between the fatty deposits and the artery lining (the intima).

These capped fatty deposits (now called &#x27;atheromas&#x27;) produce enzymes that cause the artery to enlarge over time. As long as the artery enlarges sufficiently to compensate for the extra thickness of the atheroma, then no narrowing (&quot;stenosis&quot;) of the opening (&quot;lumen&quot;) occurs. The artery expands with an egg-shaped cross-section, still with a circular opening. If the enlargement is beyond proportion to the atheroma thickness, then an aneurysm is created.

===Visible features===

Although arteries are not typically studied microscopically, two plaque types can be distinguished:

# The fibro-lipid (fibro-fatty) plaque is characterized by an accumulation of lipid-laden cells underneath the intima of the arteries, typically without narrowing the lumen due to compensatory expansion of the bounding muscular layer of the artery wall. Beneath the endothelium, there is a &quot;fibrous cap&quot; covering the atheromatous &quot;core&quot; of the plaque. The core consists of lipid-laden cells (macrophages and smooth muscle cells) with elevated tissue cholesterol and cholesterol ester content, fibrin, proteoglycans, collagen, elastin, and cellular debris. In advanced plaques, the central core of the plaque usually contains extracellular cholesterol deposits (released from dead cells), which form areas of cholesterol crystals with empty, needle-like clefts. At the periphery of the plaque are younger &quot;foamy&quot; cells and capillaries. These plaques usually produce the most damage to the individual when they rupture. Cholesterol crystals may also play a role.
# The fibrous plaque is also localized under the intima, within the arterial wall resulting in thickening and expansion of the wall and, sometimes, spotty localized narrowing of the lumen with some atrophy of the muscular layer. The fibrous plaque contains collagen fibers (eosinophilic), precipitates of calcium (hematoxylinophilic), and rarely, lipid-laden cells.

In effect, the muscular portion of the artery wall forms small aneurysms just large enough to hold the atheroma that are present. The muscular portion of artery walls usually remains strong, even after they have been remodeled to compensate for the atheromatous plaques.

However, atheromas within the vessel wall are soft and fragile with little elasticity. Arteries constantly expand and contract with each heartbeat, i.e., the pulse. In addition, the calcification deposits between the outer portion of the atheroma and the muscular wall, as they progress, lead to a loss of elasticity and stiffening of the artery as a whole.

The calcification deposits, after they have become sufficiently advanced, are partially visible on coronary artery computed tomography or electron beam tomography (EBT) as rings of increased radiographic density, forming halos around the outer edges of the atheromatous plaques, within the artery wall. On CT, &gt;130 units on the Hounsfield scale (some argue for 90 units) has been the radiographic density usually accepted as clearly representing tissue calcification within arteries. These deposits demonstrate unequivocal evidence of the disease, relatively advanced, even though the lumen of the artery is often still normal by angiography.

===Rupture and stenosis===

Although the disease process tends to be slowly progressive over decades, it usually remains asymptomatic until an atheroma , which leads to immediate blood clotting at the site of the atheroma ulcer. This triggers a cascade of events that leads to clot enlargement, which may quickly obstruct blood flow. A complete blockage leads to ischemia of the myocardial (heart) muscle and damage. This process is the myocardial infarction or &quot;heart attack&quot;.

If the heart attack is not fatal, fibrous organization of the clot within the lumen ensues, covering the rupture but also producing stenosis or closure of the lumen, or over time and after repeated ruptures, resulting in a persistent, usually localized stenosis or blockage of the artery lumen. Stenoses can be slowly progressive, whereas plaque ulceration is a sudden event that occurs specifically in atheromas with thinner/weaker fibrous caps that have become &quot;unstable&quot;.

Repeated plaque ruptures, ones not resulting in total lumen closure, combined with the clot patch over the rupture and healing response to stabilize the clot is the process that produces most stenoses over time. The stenotic areas often become more stable despite increased flow velocities at these narrowings. Most major blood-flow-stopping events occur at large plaques, which, before their rupture, produced little if any stenosis.

From clinical trials, 20% is the average stenosis at plaques that subsequently rupture with resulting complete artery closure. Most severe clinical events do not occur at plaques that produce high-grade stenosis. From clinical trials, only 14% of heart attacks occur from artery closure at plaques producing 75% or greater stenosis before the vessel closing.

If the fibrous cap separating a soft atheroma from the bloodstream within the artery ruptures, tissue fragments are exposed and released. These tissue fragments are very clot-promoting, containing collagen and tissue factor; they activate platelets and activate the system of coagulation. The result is the formation of a thrombus (blood clot) overlying the atheroma, which obstructs blood flow acutely. With the obstruction of blood flow, downstream tissues are starved of oxygen and nutrients. If this is the myocardium (heart muscle) angina (cardiac chest pain) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) develops.

===Accelerated growth of plaques===
The distribution of atherosclerotic plaques in a part of arterial endothelium is inhomogeneous. The multiple and focal development of atherosclerotic changes is similar to that in the development of amyloid plaques in the brain and age spots on the skin. Misrepair-accumulation aging theory suggests that misrepair mechanisms play an important role in the focal development of atherosclerosis. The development of a plaque is a result of the repair of the injured endothelium. Because of the infusion of lipids into the sub-endothelium, the repair has to end up with altered remodeling of the local endothelium. This is the manifestation of a misrepair. This altered remodeling increases the susceptibility of the local endothelium to damage and reduces its repair efficiency. Consequently, this part of endothelium has an increased risk of being injured and improperly repaired. Thus, the accumulation of misrepairs of endothelium is focalized and self-accelerating. In this way, the growth of a plaque is also self-accelerating. Within a part of the arterial wall, the oldest plaque is always the biggest and is the most dangerous one to cause blockage of a local artery.

===Components===
The plaque is divided into three distinct components:
# The atheroma (&quot;lump of gruel&quot;, ), which is the nodular accumulation of a soft, flaky, yellowish material at the center of large plaques, composed of macrophages nearest the lumen of the artery
# Underlying areas of cholesterol crystals
# Calcification at the outer base of older or more advanced lesions. Atherosclerotic lesions, or atherosclerotic plaques, are separated into two broad categories: Stable and unstable (also called vulnerable). The pathobiology of atherosclerotic lesions is very complicated, but generally, stable atherosclerotic plaques, which tend to be asymptomatic, are rich in extracellular matrix and smooth muscle cells. On the other hand, unstable plaques are rich in macrophages and foam cells, and the extracellular matrix separating the lesion from the arterial lumen (also known as the fibrous cap) is usually weak and prone to rupture. Ruptures of the fibrous cap expose thrombogenic material, such as collagen, to the circulation and eventually induce thrombus formation in the lumen. Upon formation, intraluminal thrombi can occlude arteries outright (e.g., coronary occlusion), but more often they detach, move into the circulation, and eventually occlude smaller downstream branches causing thromboembolism.

Apart from thromboembolism, chronically expanding atherosclerotic lesions can cause complete closure of the lumen. Chronically expanding lesions are often asymptomatic until the lumen stenosis is so severe (usually over 80%) that blood supply to downstream tissue(s) is insufficient, resulting in ischemia. These complications of advanced atherosclerosis are chronic, slowly progressive, and cumulative. Most commonly, soft plaque suddenly ruptures (see vulnerable plaque), causing the formation of a thrombus that will rapidly slow or stop blood flow, leading to the death of the tissues fed by the artery in approximately five minutes. This event is called an infarction.

==Diagnosis==

Areas of severe narrowing, stenosis, detectable by angiography, and to a lesser extent &quot;stress testing&quot; have long been the focus of human diagnostic techniques for cardiovascular disease, in general. However, these methods focus on detecting only severe narrowing, not the underlying atherosclerosis disease. As demonstrated by human clinical studies, most severe events occur in locations with heavy plaque, yet little or no lumen narrowing present before debilitating events suddenly occur. Plaque rupture can lead to artery lumen occlusion within seconds to minutes, potential permanent debility, and sometimes sudden death.

Plaques that have ruptured are called complicated lesions. The extracellular matrix of the lesion breaks, usually at the shoulder of the fibrous cap that separates the lesion from the arterial lumen, where the exposed thrombogenic components of the plaque, mainly collagen, will trigger thrombus formation. The thrombus then travels downstream to other blood vessels, where the blood clot may partially or completely block blood flow. If the blood flow is completely blocked, cell deaths occur due to the lack of oxygen supply to nearby cells, resulting in necrosis. The narrowing or obstruction of blood flow can occur in any artery within the body. Obstruction of arteries supplying the heart muscle results in a heart attack, while the obstruction of arteries supplying the brain results in an ischaemic stroke.

Lumen stenosis that is greater than 75% was considered the hallmark of clinically significant disease in the past because recurring episodes of angina and abnormalities in stress tests are only detectable at that particular severity of stenosis. However, clinical trials have shown that only about 14% of clinically debilitating events occur at sites with more than 75% stenosis. Most cardiovascular events that involve sudden rupture of the atheroma plaque do not display any evident luminal narrowing. Thus, greater attention has been focused on &quot;vulnerable plaque&quot; from the late 1990s onwards.

Besides the traditional diagnostic methods such as angiography and stress-testing, other detection techniques have been developed in the past decades for earlier detection of atherosclerotic disease. Some of the detection approaches include anatomical detection and physiologic measurement.

Examples of anatomical detection methods include coronary calcium scoring by CT, carotid IMT (intimal media thickness) measurement by ultrasound, and intravascular imaging techniques, such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT), allowing direct visualization of atherosclerotic plaques.

Other methods include blood measurements, e.g., lipoprotein subclass analysis, HbA1c, hs-CRP, and homocysteine.

Both anatomic and physiologic methods allow early detection before symptoms show up, disease staging, and tracking of disease progression. 

In recent years, developments in nuclear imaging techniques such as PET and SPECT have provided non-invasive ways of estimating the severity of atherosclerotic plaques.

==Prevention==
Up to 90% of cardiovascular disease may be preventable if established risk factors are avoided. Medical management of atherosclerosis first involves modification to risk factors–for example, via smoking cessation and diet restrictions. Prevention is generally by eating a healthy diet, exercising, not smoking, and maintaining a normal weight.

===Diet===
Changes in diet may help prevent the development of atherosclerosis. Tentative evidence suggests that a diet containing dairy products has no effect on or decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease.

A diet high in fruits and vegetables decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease and death. Evidence suggests that the Mediterranean diet may improve cardiovascular results. There is also evidence that a Mediterranean diet may be better than a low-fat diet in bringing about long-term changes to cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., lower cholesterol level and blood pressure). A 2024 review highlighted that bioactive compounds found in Mediterranean diet components (such as olive, grape, garlic, rosemary, and saffron) exhibit properties that may contribute to cardiovascular health and atherosclerosis prevention.

===Exercise===
A controlled exercise program combats atherosclerosis by improving the circulation and functionality of the vessels. Exercise is also used to manage weight in patients who are obese, lower blood pressure, and decrease cholesterol. Often lifestyle modification is combined with medication therapy. For example, statins help to lower cholesterol. Antiplatelet medications like aspirin help to prevent clots, and a variety of antihypertensive medications are routinely used to control blood pressure. If the combined efforts of risk factor modification and medication therapy are not sufficient to control symptoms or fight imminent threats of ischemic events, a physician may resort to interventional or surgical procedures to correct the obstruction.

==Treatment==
Treatment of established disease may include medications to lower cholesterol such as statins, blood pressure medication, or medications that decrease clotting, such as aspirin. Many procedures may also be carried out such as percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft, or carotid endarterectomy.

Medical treatments often focus on alleviating symptoms. However, measures that focus on decreasing underlying atherosclerosis—as opposed to simply treating symptoms—are more effective. Non-pharmaceutical means are usually the first method of treatment, such as stopping smoking and practicing regular exercise. If these methods do not work, medicines are usually the next step in treating cardiovascular diseases and, with improvements, have increasingly become the most effective method over the long term.

The key to the more effective approaches is to combine different treatment strategies. In addition, for those approaches, such as lipoprotein transport behaviors, which have been shown to produce the most success, adopting more aggressive combination treatment strategies taken daily and indefinitely has generally produced better results, both before and especially after people are symptomatic.

===Statins===
Statin medications are widely prescribed for treating atherosclerosis. They have shown benefit in reducing cardiovascular disease and mortality in those with high cholesterol with few side effects. Secondary prevention therapy, which includes high-intensity statins and aspirin, is recommended by multi-society guidelines for all patients with a history of ASCVD (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) to prevent the recurrence of coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, or peripheral arterial disease. However, prescription of and adherence to these guideline-concordant therapies is lacking, particularly among young patients and women.

Statins work by inhibiting HMG-CoA (hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase, a hepatic rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol&#x27;s biochemical production pathway. Inhibiting this rate-limiting enzyme reduces the body&#x27;s ability to produce as much cholesterol endogenously, thereby reducing the level of LDL-cholesterol in the blood. This reduced endogenous cholesterol production triggers the body to then pull cholesterol from other cellular sources, enhancing serum HDL-cholesterol. These data are primarily in middle-aged men and the conclusions are less clear for women and people over the age of 70.

===Surgery===
When atherosclerosis has become severe and caused irreversible ischemia, such as tissue loss in the case of peripheral artery disease, surgery may be indicated. Vascular bypass surgery can re-establish flow around the diseased segment of the artery, and angioplasty with or without stenting can reopen narrowed arteries and improve blood flow. Coronary artery bypass grafting without manipulation of the ascending aorta has demonstrated reduced rates of postoperative stroke and mortality compared to traditional on-pump coronary revascularization.

===Other===
There is evidence that some anticoagulants, particularly warfarin, which inhibit clot formation by interfering with Vitamin K metabolism, may promote arterial calcification in the long term despite reducing clot formation in the short term. Also, small molecules such as 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde and protocatechuic aldehyde have shown vasculoprotective effects to reduce risk of atherosclerosis.

==Epidemiology==
Cardiovascular disease, which is predominantly the clinical manifestation of atherosclerosis, is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.

Almost all children older than age 10 in developed countries have aortic fatty streaks, with coronary fatty streaks beginning in adolescence.

In 1953, a study was published that examined the results of 300 autopsies performed on U.S. soldiers who had died in the Korean War. Despite the average age of the soldiers being just 22 years old, 77% of them had visible signs of coronary atherosclerosis. This study showed that heart disease could affect people at a younger age and was not just a problem for older individuals.

In 1992, a report showed that microscopic fatty streaks were seen in the left anterior descending artery in over 50% of children aged 10–14 and 8% had even more advanced lesions with more accumulations of extracellular lipid.

A 2005 report of a study done between 1985 and 1995 found that around 87% of aortas and 30% of coronary arteries in the age group 5–14 years had fatty streaks which increased with age.

== Etymology ==
The following terms are similar, yet distinct, in both spelling and meaning, and can be easily confused: arteriosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and atherosclerosis. &quot;Arteriosclerosis&quot; is a general term describing any hardening (and loss of elasticity) of medium or large arteries (); &quot;arteriolosclerosis&quot; is any hardening (and loss of elasticity) of arterioles (small arteries); &quot;atherosclerosis&quot; is a hardening of an artery specifically due to an atheromatous plaque (). The term &quot;atherogenic&quot; is used for substances or processes that cause the formation of atheroma.

==Economics==
In 2011, coronary atherosclerosis was one of the top ten most expensive conditions seen during inpatient hospitalizations in the US, with aggregate inpatient hospital costs of $10.4 billion.

== Research ==
===Lipids===
An indication of the role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) on atherosclerosis has been with the rare Apo-A1 Milano human genetic variant of this HDL protein. A small short-term trial using bacterial synthesized human Apo-A1 Milano HDL in people with unstable angina produced a fairly dramatic reduction in measured coronary plaque volume in only six weeks vs. the usual increase in plaque volume in those randomized to placebo. The trial was published in &quot;JAMA&quot; in early 2006. Ongoing work starting in the 1990s may lead to human clinical trials—probably by about 2008. These may use synthesized Apo-A1 Milano HDL directly, or they may use gene-transfer methods to pass the ability to synthesize the Apo-A1 Milano HDLipoprotein.

Methods to increase HDL particle concentrations, which in some animal studies largely reverses and removes atheromas, are being developed and researched. However, increasing HDL by any means is not necessarily helpful. For example, the drug torcetrapib is the most effective agent currently known for raising HDL (by up to 60%). However, in clinical trials, it also raised deaths by 60%. All studies regarding this drug were halted in December 2006.

The actions of macrophages drive atherosclerotic plaque progression.
&quot;Immunomodulation of atherosclerosis&quot; is the term for techniques that modulate immune system function to suppress this macrophage action.

Involvement of lipid peroxidation chain reaction in atherogenesis triggered research on the protective role of the heavy isotope (deuterated) polyunsaturated fatty acids (D-PUFAs) that are less prone to oxidation than ordinary PUFAs (H-PUFAs). PUFAs are essential nutrients – they are involved in metabolism in that very form as they are consumed with food. In transgenic mice, a model for human-like lipoprotein metabolism, adding D-PUFAs to the diet reduced body weight gain, improved cholesterol handling, and reduced atherosclerotic damage to the aorta.

===miRNA===
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have complementary sequences in the 3&#x27; UTR and 5&#x27; UTR of target mRNAs of protein-coding genes, and cause mRNA cleavage or repression of translational machinery. In diseased vascular vessels, miRNAs are dysregulated and highly expressed. miR-33 is found in cardiovascular diseases. It is involved in atherosclerotic initiation and progression including lipid metabolism, insulin signaling and glucose homeostatis, cell type progression and proliferation, and myeloid cell differentiation. It was found in rodents that the inhibition of miR-33 will raise HDL-C levels and the expression of miR-33 is down-regulated in humans with atherosclerotic plaques.

miR-33a and miR-33b are located on intron 16 of human sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) gene on chromosome 22 and intron 17 of SREBP1 gene on chromosome 17. miR-33a/b regulates cholesterol/lipid homeostasis by binding in the 3&#x27;UTRs of genes involved in cholesterol transport such as ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters and enhance or represses its expression. Studies have shown that ABCA1 mediates cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues to Apolipoprotein-1. It is also important in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, where cholesterol is delivered from peripheral tissue to the liver, where it can be excreted into bile or converted to bile acids before excretion. Therefore, ABCA1 prevents cholesterol accumulation in macrophages. By enhancing miR-33 function, the level of ABCA1 is decreased, leading to decreased cellular cholesterol efflux to apoA-1. On the other hand, by inhibiting miR-33 function, the level of ABCA1 is increased and increases the cholesterol efflux to apoA-1. Suppression of miR-33 will lead to less cellular cholesterol and higher plasma HDL level through the regulation of ABCA1 expression.

===DNA damage===
Aging is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular problems. The causative basis by which aging mediates its impact, independently of other recognized risk factors, remains to be determined. Evidence has been reviewed for a key role of DNA damage in vascular aging.
8-oxoG, a common type of oxidative damage in DNA, is found to accumulate in plaque vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophages and endothelial cells, thus linking DNA damage to plaque formation. DNA strand breaks also increased in atherosclerotic plaques. Werner syndrome (WS) is a premature aging condition in humans. WS is caused by a genetic defect in a RecQ helicase that is employed in several repair processes that remove damages from DNA. WS patients develop a considerable burden of atherosclerotic plaques in their coronary arteries and aorta: calcification of the aortic valve is also frequently observed. These findings link excessive unrepaired DNA damage to premature aging and early atherosclerotic plaque development (see DNA damage theory of aging).

===Microorganisms===
The microbiota – all the microorganisms in the body, can contribute to atherosclerosis in many ways: modulation of the immune system, changes in metabolism, processing of nutrients and production of certain metabolites that can get into blood circulation. One such metabolite, produced by gut bacteria, is trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Its levels have been associated with atherosclerosis in human studies and animal research suggests that there may be a causal relation. An association between the bacterial genes encoding trimethylamine lyases — the enzymes involved in TMAO generation — and atherosclerosis has been noted.

=== Vascular smooth muscle cells ===
Vascular smooth muscle cells play a key role in atherogenesis and were historically considered to be beneficial for plaque stability by forming a protective fibrous cap and synthesizing strength-giving extracellular matrix components. However, in addition to the fibrous cap, vascular smooth muscle cells also give rise to many of the cell types found within the plaque core and can modulate their phenotype to both promote and reduce plaque stability. Vascular smooth muscle cells exhibit pronounced plasticity within atherosclerotic plaque and can modify their gene expression profile to resemble various other cell types, including macrophages, myofibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells and osteochondrocytes. Importantly, genetic lineage-tracing experiments have unequivocally shown that 40-90% of plaque-resident cells are vascular smooth muscle cell-derived, therefore, it is important to research the role of vascular smooth muscle cells in atherosclerosis to identify new therapeutic targets.

The sugar cyclodextrin (CD) removed cholesterol that had built up in the arteries of mice fed a high-fat diet. CD is absorbed into the mouse bloodstream. It increases the production of oxysterols in macrophages and plaques, which causes the activation of LXR in macrophages. This in turn causes the macrophages more capable of cholesterol efflux and makes them more anti-inflammatory.

<text>In Roman mythology, Moneta (Latin Monēta) was a title given to two separate goddesses: It was the name of the goddess of memory (identified with the Greek goddess Mnemosyne), and it was an epithet of Juno, called Juno Moneta (Latin Iūno Monēta). The latter&#x27;s name is the source of numerous words in English and the Romance languages, including “&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

The cult of the goddess Moneta was established largely under the influence of Greek religion, which featured the cult of Mnemosyne (&quot;Μνημοσύνη&quot;), the goddess of memory and the mother of the Muses. The goddess&#x27;s name is derived from Latin &quot;monēre&quot; (which means to remind, warn, or instruct). She is mentioned in a fragment of Livius Andronicus&#x27; Latin Odyssey: &quot;Nam diva Monetas filia docuit&quot; (&quot;since the divine daughter of Moneta has taught...&quot;, frg. 21 Büchner), which may be the equivalent of either Od. 8,480-1 or 488.

The epithet Moneta that was given to Juno, in contrast, is more likely to have derived from the Greek word &quot;moneres&quot; (&quot;μονήρης&quot;), meaning &quot;alone”, or “unique&quot;. By the time Andronicus was writing, the folk etymology of &quot;monēre&quot; was widely accepted, and so he could plausibly transmute this epithet into a reference to separate goddess - the literary (though not the religious) counterpart of the Greek Mnemosyne.

== Juno Moneta and Hyginus&#x27; Moneta==
Juno Moneta, an epithet of Juno, was the protectress of funds, and, accordingly, money in ancient Rome was coined in her temple. The word &quot;moneta&quot; (from which the words &quot;money&quot; and &quot;monetize&quot; are derived) was used by writers such as Ovid, Martial, Juvenal, and Cicero. In several modern languages, including Russian and Italian, &quot;moneta&quot; (Spanish &quot;moneda&quot;) is the word for &quot;coin&quot;.

Juno Moneta&#x27;s name (like the name of the goddess Moneta) is derived either from the Latin &quot;monēre&quot; (since, as the protectress of funds, she &quot;warned&quot; of economic instability) or, more likely, from the Greek &quot;moneres&quot;, meaning &quot;alone” or “unique&quot;.

According to the Suda, a Byzantine encyclopedia (which uses the Greek names of the goddess), she was called Moneta (Μονήτα) because when the Romans needed money during the wars against Pyrrhus and Taranto, they prayed to Hera, and she replied to them that, if they would hold out against the enemies with justice, they would not go short of money. After the wars, the Romans honoured Hera Moneta (that is, advisor - invoking the Latin verb moneo, meaning to &#x27;warn&#x27; or &#x27;advise&#x27;), and, accordingly, decided to stamp the coinage in her temple.
Hyginus in his Fabulae, writes of Moneta as a Titaness daughter of Aether and Tellus, and as the mother by Jove of the nine Muses. Hyginus doesn&#x27;t seem to identify Moneta with either Juno or Mnemosyne, as the latter is later called a daughter of Jove and Clymene.

== Coinage==
&quot;Moneta&quot; retained the meanings of &quot;money&quot; and &quot;die&quot; well into the Middle Ages and appeared often on minted coins. For example, the phrase &quot;moneta nova&quot; is regular on coins of the low countries and the rhineland in the fourteenth and fifteenth century, with the &quot;nova&quot;, Latin for &quot;new&quot;, not necessarily signifying a new type or variety of coin.

== In culture ==
Moneta is a central figure in John Keats&#x27; poem &quot;The Fall of Hyperion: A Dream&quot;.

<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale is a metropolitan borough of Greater Manchester in England. Its largest town is Rochdale and the wider borough covers other outlying towns and villages, including Heywood, Littleborough, Middleton &amp; Milnrow. It is the ninth-largest district by population in Greater Manchester with a population of in .

==History==
Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, the borough was formed in 1974 as part of the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972 and is an amalgamation of six former local government districts. It was originally proposed that the borough include the neighbouring town of Bury and disclude Middleton; Bury however went on to form the administrative centre for the adjacent Metropolitan Borough of Bury. The borough was formed by a merger of the former county borough of Rochdale and from the administrative county of Lancashire, the municipal boroughs of Heywood and Middleton, along with the urban districts of Littleborough, Milnrow and Wardle. The borough lies mostly within the historic county of Lancashire but a small part lies in the former West Riding of Yorkshire. Prior to its creation, it was suggested that the metropolitan borough be named Chadwick (with reference to Sir Edwin Chadwick), but this was rejected in favour of Rochdale.


==Premises==

The council is based at Number One Riverside in Rochdale town centre, which was opened in 2014. It serves as a public library, includes a café, private meeting areas, a conference centre and a workplace. It merged 33 buildings into one and won the award for the best workplace of 2014.

===Electoral arrangements===
The borough of Rochdale is divided into 20 wards, each ward having three councillors for a total of 60 councillors. Councillors serve four-year terms, with one-third of the council elected every year except every fourth year when no councilors are elected.

===Current political make-up===
The council has been controlled by Labour since 2011.

==Geography==

The borough lies directly north-northeast of the City of Manchester, to the east of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, to the north of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham and partly to the east of the county of West Yorkshire bordering near to the Metropolitan Borough of Calderdale and the Lancashire borough of Rossendale is to the northwest. There are some rural parts and urban parts of the district including Blackstone Edge and the Pennine hills which form part of the rural areas of the borough. The more urban areas centre around the town and neighbouring boroughs of Bury, Oldham and Manchester. The town of Middleton is contiguous with the northeastern suburbs of Manchester and the towns of Chadderton, Failsworth and Oldham. The towns of Heywood, Littleborough and Milnrow form an urban area with Rochdale.

<doc id="85405" wikidata="Q1417853" url="?curid=85405" title="Laverna">
<text>In Roman mythology, Laverna was a goddess of gain or profit and the underworld, who became associated with the protection of lower classes, refugees, and plans developed by thieves. She was propitiated by libations poured with the left hand. The poet Horace and the playwright Plautus called her a goddess of thieves. In Rome, her sanctuary was near the Porta Lavernalis, the gate on the northern summit of the Aventine Hill.

== Etymology ==
Several explanations have been given for the origins of the name:

# from the PIE reconstruction , meaning &quot;profit, gain&quot;, which makes it cognate with the more familiar . This is currently cited as the most likely etymology;
# from Ancient Roman writings (Schol. on Horace, who gives as another form of or robber);
# from (Acron on Horace, according to whom thieves were called , perhaps referring to bath thieves).

== History ==
Laverna was an Etruscan deity in ancient Italy, originally one of the spirits of the underworld. A cup found in an Etruscan tomb bears the inscription &quot;,&quot; (cf. ); and in a fragment of Septimius Serenus Laverna is expressly mentioned in connection with the , the underworld. She was worshiped at many sites by the Etruscans. 

By an easy transition into Ancient Roman mythology after Etruscan culture was superseded by that of Rome, Laverna came to be regarded as the protectress of thieves, whose operations were associated with darkness. She had an altar on the Aventine Hill, near the gate named after her, Lavernalis, on the northern summit of the southernmost of the seven hills of Rome. She had a sacred grove on the Via Salaria, the road across Italy that connects Rome to the Adriatic Sea.

Roman sources state that her aid was invoked by thieves to enable them to carry out their plans successfully without forfeiting their reputation for piety and honesty. 

A sacred mountain in Tuscany entitled, La Verna, was the site of an ancient sanctuary of the goddess. This remote &quot;Sanctuary of La Verna&quot; was given to St. Francis by Count Orlando of Chiusi on May 8, 1213, and became the site where he chose to establish his religious order. In 1218, the Santa Maria degli Angeli chapel was built at the site. 

== Popular culture ==
Her name is used for the main antagonist in the CGI animation &quot;&quot; film series. Laverna is an evil fairy who is the twin sister of the land&#x27;s fairy queen, The Enchantress.

In &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;, Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s Dupin describes the ineffective Prefect of Police as &quot;too cunning to be profound. In his wisdom is no stamen. It is all head and no body, like the pictures of the Goddess Laverna.&quot;

&quot;Laverna&quot; is an unofficial nickname for Otter 841.

<text>John Michael &quot;Ozzy&quot; Osbourne /&#x27;ɒzi: &#x27;ɒzbɔːrn/ (born 3 December 1948) is an English singer, songwriter, and media personality. He rose to prominence during the 1970s as the lead singer of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath, during which period he adopted the nickname &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;.

Osbourne became a founding member of Black Sabbath in 1968, providing lead vocals from their self-titled debut album in 1970 to &quot;Never Say Die!&quot; in 1978. The band was highly influential in the development of heavy metal music, in particular their critically acclaimed releases &quot;Paranoid&quot;, &quot;Master of Reality&quot;, and &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;. Osbourne was fired from Black Sabbath in 1979 due to alcohol and drug problems. He then began a successful solo career with &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; in 1980 and has released 13 studio albums, the first seven of which received multi-platinum certifications in the US. He has since reunited with Black Sabbath on several occasions. He rejoined in 1997 and helped record the group&#x27;s final studio album, &quot;13&quot; (2013), before they embarked on a farewell tour that ended with a 2017 performance in their native Birmingham.

Osbourne has sold over 100 million albums, including his solo work and Black Sabbath releases. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Black Sabbath in 2006 and as a solo artist in 2024. He was also inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame both solo and with Black Sabbath in 2005. He has been honoured with stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Birmingham Walk of Stars. At the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards, he received the Global Icon Award. In 2015, he received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.

In the early 2000s, Osbourne became a reality television star when he appeared in the MTV reality show &quot;The Osbournes&quot; alongside his wife and manager Sharon and two of their children, Kelly and Jack. He co-stars with Jack and Kelly in the television series &quot;Ozzy &amp; Jack&#x27;s World Detour&quot;.

==Early life==
Osbourne was born at Maternity Hospital in Marston Green on 3 December 1948, and grew up in the Aston area of Birmingham. His mother, Lilian (née Unitt; 1916–2001), was a non-observant Catholic who worked at a Lucas factory. His father, John Thomas &quot;Jack&quot; Osbourne (1915–1977), worked night shifts as a toolmaker at the General Electric Company. Osbourne has three older sisters named Jean, Iris, and Gillian, and two younger brothers named Paul and Tony. The family lived in a small two-bedroom home at 14 Lodge Road in Aston. Osbourne gained the nickname &quot;Ozzy&quot; as a child. He dealt with dyslexia at school. His accent has been described as a &quot;hesitant Brummie&quot;. At the age of 11, he suffered sexual abuse from school bullies. He claims to have attempted suicide multiple times as a teenager.

Osbourne left school at the age of 15 and was employed as a construction site labourer, trainee plumber, apprentice toolmaker, car factory horn-tuner, and slaughterhouse worker. At the age of 17, Osbourne was convicted of robbing a clothes shop, but was unable to pay the fine; his father also refused to pay it in order to teach him a lesson, resulting in Osbourne spending six weeks in Winson Green Prison. He participated in school plays, including Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Mikado&quot; and &quot;HMS Pinafore&quot;. Upon hearing the first hit single of the Beatles at age 14, he became a fan of the band and credited their 1963 song &quot;She Loves You&quot; with inspiring him to become a musician. In the 2011 documentary &quot;God Bless Ozzy Osbourne&quot;, he said that the Beatles made him realise that &quot;[he] was going to be a rock star the rest of [his] life&quot;.

==Career==
===Black Sabbath===

In late 1967, Geezer Butler formed his first band, Rare Breed, and recruited Osbourne to be the singer. The band played two shows and broke up. Osbourne and Butler reunited in another band, Polka Tulk Blues, which included guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward, whose band Mythology recently broke up. They renamed the band Earth. But after being accidentally booked for a show instead of a different band with the same name, they decided to change the band&#x27;s name again, settling on the name Black Sabbath in August 1969. The band&#x27;s name was inspired by the film of the same title. Black Sabbath noticed how people enjoyed being frightened during their appearances, which inspired their decision to play a heavy blues style of music laced with gloomy sounds and lyrics. While recording their first album, Butler read an occult book and woke up seeing a dark figure at the end of his bed. Butler told Osbourne about it, and together they wrote the lyrics to &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, their first song in a darker vein.

The band&#x27;s U.S. record label, Warner Bros. Records, invested only modestly in it, but Black Sabbath met with swift and enduring success. Built around Tony Iommi&#x27;s guitar riffs, Geezer Butler&#x27;s lyrics, Bill Ward&#x27;s dark tempo drumbeats, and topped by Osbourne&#x27;s eerie vocals, their debut album &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; and &quot;Paranoid&quot; were commercially successful and also gained considerable radio airplay. Osbourne recalls, however, that, &quot;in those days, the band wasn&#x27;t very popular with the women&quot;.

At about this time, Osbourne first met his future wife, Sharon Arden. After the unexpected success of their first album, Black Sabbath were considering her father, Don Arden, as their new manager, and Sharon was at that time working as Don&#x27;s receptionist. Osbourne admits he was attracted to her immediately but assumed that &quot;she probably thought I was a lunatic&quot;. Osbourne later recalled that the best thing about eventually choosing Don Arden as manager was that he got to see Sharon regularly, though their relationship was strictly professional at that point.

Just five months after the release of &quot;Paranoid&quot;, the band released &quot;Master of Reality&quot;. The album reached the top ten in both the United States and UK, and was certified gold in less than two months. In the 1980s, it received platinum certification and went Double Platinum in the early 21st century. Reviews of the album were unfavourable. Lester Bangs of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; famously dismissed &quot;Master of Reality&quot; as &quot;naïve, simplistic, repetitive, absolute doggerel&quot;, although the very same magazine would later place the album at number 298 on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list, compiled in 2003. 

In September 1972, Black Sabbath released &quot;Black Sabbath Vol. 4&quot;. Critics were dismissive of the album, but it reached gold status in less than a month and was the band&#x27;s fourth consecutive album to sell over one million copies in the United States.

In November 1973, Black Sabbath released the critically acclaimed &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;. For the first time, the band received favourable reviews in the mainstream press. Gordon Fletcher of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;an extraordinarily gripping affair&quot; and &quot;nothing less than a complete success&quot;. Decades later, &quot;AllMusic&#x27;s&quot; Eduardo Rivadavia called the album a &quot;masterpiece, essential to any heavy metal collection&quot;, while also claiming the band displayed &quot;a newfound sense of finesse and maturity&quot;. The album marked the band&#x27;s fifth consecutive platinum selling album in the US. &quot;Sabotage&quot; was released in July 1975. Again there were favourable reviews. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated, &quot;&quot;Sabotage&quot; is not only Black Sabbath&#x27;s best record since &quot;Paranoid&quot;, it might be their best ever.&quot; In a retrospective review, AllMusic was less favourable, noting that &quot;the magical chemistry that made such albums as &quot;Paranoid&quot; and &quot;Volume 4&quot; so special was beginning to disintegrate&quot;. &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot;, released on 25 September 1976, was also met with mixed reviews. AllMusic gives the album two stars, and notes that the band was &quot;unravelling at an alarming rate&quot;.

====Dismissal====
In 1978, Osbourne left the band for three months to pursue a solo project called &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot;, a title which had been suggested by his father. Three members of the band Necromandus, who had supported Sabbath in Birmingham when they were called &quot;Earth&quot;, backed Osbourne in the studio and briefly became the first incarnation of his solo band.

At the request of the other band members, Osbourne rejoined Sabbath. The band spent five months at Sounds Interchange Studios in Toronto, where they wrote and recorded their next album, &quot;Never Say Die!&quot; &quot;It took quite a long time&quot;, Iommi said of &quot;Never Say Die!&quot; &quot;We were getting really drugged out, doing a lot of dope. We&#x27;d go down to the sessions, and have to pack up because we were too stoned; we&#x27;d have to stop. Nobody could get anything right; we were all over the place, and everybody was playing a different thing. We&#x27;d go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day.&quot;

In May 1978, Black Sabbath began touring in support of &quot;Never Say Die!&quot; with Van Halen as an opening act. Reviewers called Sabbath&#x27;s performance &quot;tired and uninspired&quot; in stark contrast to the &quot;youthful&quot; performance of Van Halen, who were touring the world for the first time. The band recorded their concert at Hammersmith Odeon in June 1978, which was released on video as &quot;Never Say Die&quot;. The final show of the tour and Osbourne&#x27;s last appearance with Black Sabbath for another seven years, until 1985, was in Albuquerque, New Mexico on 11 December.

In 1979, Black Sabbath returned to the studio, but tension and conflict arose between band members. Osbourne recalls being asked to record his vocals over and over, and tracks were manipulated endlessly by Iommi. The relationship between Osbourne and Iommi became contentious. On 27 April 1979, at Iommi&#x27;s insistence but with the support of Butler and Ward, Osbourne was ejected from Black Sabbath. The reasons provided to him were that he was unreliable and had excessive substance abuse issues compared to the other members. Osbourne claims his drug use and alcohol consumption at that time was neither better nor worse than that of the other members.

The band replaced Osbourne with former Rainbow singer Ronnie James Dio. In a 21 August 1987 interview with Tommy Vance on BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Friday Rock Show&quot;, Dio said, &quot;I was not, and never will be, Ozzy Osbourne. He was the vocalist and songwriter in that era who helped create that band and make it what it was, and what it is in its classic form.&quot;

The conflict between Iommi and Osbourne commenced almost immediately in their working collaboration. Responding to a 1969 flyer that read, &quot;Ozzy Zig Needs Gig- has own PA&quot;, which was posted by Osbourne in a record store, Iommi and Ward arrived at the listed address to speak with Ozzy Zig, as he then called himself. When Iommi saw Osbourne emerge from another room of the house, he recalled that he knew him as a &quot;pest&quot; from their school days. Following Black Sabbath&#x27;s formation, Iommi reportedly &quot;punched out&quot; Osbourne several times over the years when the singer&#x27;s drunken antics became too much to take. Iommi recalls one incident in the early 1970s in which Osbourne and Butler were fighting in a hotel room. Iommi pulled Osbourne off Butler in an attempt to break up the drunken fight, and the vocalist proceeded to turn around and take a wild swing at him. Iommi responded by knocking Osbourne unconscious with one punch to the jaw.

===Solo career===

After leaving Black Sabbath, Osbourne recalled, &quot;I&#x27;d got £96,000 for my share of the name, so I&#x27;d just locked myself away and spent three months doing coke and booze. My thinking was, &#x27;This is my last party, because after this I&#x27;m going back to Birmingham and the dole.&quot; However, Don Arden signed him to Jet Records with the aim of recording new material. Arden dispatched his daughter Sharon to Los Angeles to &quot;look after Ozzy&#x27;s needs, whatever they were&quot;, to protect his investment. Arden initially hoped Osbourne would return to Sabbath, who he was personally managing at that time, and later attempted to convince the singer to name his new band &quot;Son of Sabbath&quot;, which Osbourne hated. Sharon attempted to convince Osbourne to form a supergroup with guitarist Gary Moore. &quot;When I lived in Los Angeles&quot;, Moore recalled, &quot;&quot;[Moore&#x27;s band]&quot; G-Force helped him to audition musicians. If drummers were trying out, I played guitar, and if a bassist came along, my drummer would help out. We felt sorry for him, basically. He was always hovering around trying to get me to join, and I wasn&#x27;t having any of it.&quot;

In late 1979, under the management of the Ardens, Osbourne formed the Blizzard of Ozz, featuring drummer Lee Kerslake (of Uriah Heep), bassist-lyricist Bob Daisley (of Rainbow and, later, Uriah Heep), keyboardist Don Airey (of Rainbow and, later, Deep Purple), and guitarist Randy Rhoads (of Quiet Riot). The record company eventually titled the group&#x27;s debut album &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot;, credited simply to Osbourne, thus commencing his solo career. Co-written with Daisley and Rhoads, it brought Osbourne considerable success on his first solo effort. Though it is generally accepted that Osbourne and Rhoads started the band, Daisley later claimed that he and Osbourne formed the band in England before Rhoads officially joined.

&quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; is one of the few albums amongst the 100 best-sellers of the 1980s to have achieved multi-platinum status without the benefit of a top-40 single. As of August 1997, it had achieved quadruple platinum status, according to RIAA. &quot;I envied Ozzy&#x27;s career...&quot; remarked former Sabbath drummer Bill Ward. &quot;He seemed to be coming around from whatever it was that he&#x27;d gone through, and he seemed to be on his way again; making records and stuff… I envied it because I &quot;wanted&quot; that... I was bitter. And I had a thoroughly miserable time.&quot;

Osbourne&#x27;s second album, &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, featured more songs co-written with Lee Kerslake. For his work on this album and &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot;, Rhoads was ranked the 85th-greatest guitarist of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 2003. This album is known for the singles &quot;Over the Mountain&quot; and &quot;Flying High Again&quot; and, as Osbourne explains in his autobiography, is his personal favourite. Tommy Aldridge and Rudy Sarzo soon replaced Kerslake and Daisley. Aldridge had been Osbourne&#x27;s original choice for drummer, but a commitment to Gary Moore had made him unavailable. Sarzo had played in Quiet Riot with Rhoads, who recommended him for the position.

On 19 March 1982, the band was in Florida for its &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; tour, a week away from playing Madison Square Garden in New York City. A light aircraft piloted by Andrew Aycock, the band&#x27;s tour bus driver, carrying Rhoads and Rachel Youngblood, the band&#x27;s costume and make-up designer, crashed while performing low passes over the band&#x27;s tour bus. The left wing of the aircraft clipped the bus, causing the plane to graze a tree and crash into the garage of a nearby mansion, killing Rhoads, Aycock, and Youngblood. The crash was ruled the result of &quot;poor judgement by the pilot in buzzing the bus and misjudging clearance of obstacles&quot;. Experiencing firsthand the horrific death of his close friend and bandmate, Osbourne fell into a deep depression. The tour was cancelled for two weeks while Osbourne, Sharon, and Aldridge returned to Los Angeles to take stock while Sarzo remained in Florida with family.

Gary Moore was the first to be approached to replace Rhoads, but refused. With a two-week deadline to find a new guitarist and resume the tour, Robert Sarzo, brother of the band&#x27;s bassist Rudy Sarzo, was chosen to replace Rhoads. Former Gillan guitarist Bernie Tormé, however, flew to California from England with the promise from Jet Records that he had the job. Once Sharon realised that Jet Records had already paid Tormé an advance, he was reluctantly hired instead of Sarzo. The tour resumed on 1 April 1982, but Tormé&#x27;s blues-based style was unpopular with fans. After a handful of shows he informed Sharon that he would be returning to England to continue work on a solo album he had begun before coming to America. At an audition in a hotel room, Osbourne selected Night Ranger&#x27;s Brad Gillis to finish the tour. The tour culminated in the release of the 1982 live album &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot;, recorded at the Ritz in New York City. A live tribute album for Rhoads was also later released. Despite the difficulties, Osbourne moved on after Rhoads&#x27; death. &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot;, known in the United Kingdom as &quot;Talk of the Devil&quot;, was originally planned to consist of live recordings from 1981, primarily from Osbourne&#x27;s solo work. Under contract to produce a live album, it ended up consisting entirely of Sabbath covers recorded with Gillis, Sarzo and Tommy Aldridge.

In 1982, Osbourne appeared as lead vocalist on the Was (Not Was) pop dance track &quot;Shake Your Head (Let&#x27;s Go to Bed)&quot;. Remixed and rereleased in the early 1990s for a Was (Not Was) hits album in Europe, it reached number four on the UK Singles Chart. In 1983, Jake E. Lee, formerly of Ratt and Rough Cutt, joined Osbourne to record &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot;. The album, cowritten with Daisley, featured Aldridge and former Rainbow keyboard player Don Airey. The album contains the fan favourite &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot;. The music video for &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot; was partially filmed at the Holloway Sanitorium outside London, England. Within weeks the album became certified gold. It has sold three million copies in the US. 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot; followed (with bassist Phil Soussan and drummer Randy Castillo), and touring behind both albums with former Uriah Heep keyboardist John Sinclair joining prior to the Ultimate Sin tour. At the time of its release, &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot; was Osbourne&#x27;s highest-charting studio album. The RIAA awarded the album Platinum status on 14 May 1986, soon after its release; it was awarded Double Platinum status on 26 October 1994.

Jake E. Lee and Osbourne parted ways in 1987. Osbourne continued to struggle with chemical dependency. That year, he commemorated the fifth anniversary of Rhoads&#x27; death with &quot;Tribute&quot;, a collection of live recordings from 1981. In 1988, Osbourne appeared in &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years&quot; and told the director Penelope Spheeris that &quot;sobriety fucking sucks&quot;. Meanwhile, Osbourne found Zakk Wylde, who was the most enduring replacement for Rhoads to date. Together, they recorded &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot; with Castillo on drums, Sinclair on keyboards, and Daisley co-writing lyrics and playing bass. The subsequent tour saw Osbourne reunited with erstwhile Black Sabbath bandmate Geezer Butler on bass. A live EP (entitled &quot;Just Say Ozzy&quot;) featuring Geezer was released two years later. In 1988, Osbourne performed on the rock ballad &quot;Close My Eyes Forever&quot;, a duet with Lita Ford, reaching No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In 1989, Osbourne performed at the Moscow Music Peace Festival.

Successful through the 1980s, Osbourne sustained commercial success into the 1990s, starting with 1991&#x27;s &quot;No More Tears&quot;, featuring &quot;Mama, I&#x27;m Coming Home&quot;. The album enjoyed much radio and MTV exposure. It also initiated a practice of bringing in outside composers to help pen Osbourne&#x27;s solo material instead of relying on his recording ensemble. The album was mixed by veteran rock producer Michael Wagener. Osbourne was awarded a Grammy Award for the track &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Change the World&quot; from &quot;Live &amp; Loud&quot;, for Best Metal Performance of 1994. Wagener also mixed the live album &quot;Live &amp; Loud&quot; released on 28 June 1993. Intended to be Osbourne&#x27;s final album, it went platinum four times over, and ranked at number 10 on that year&#x27;s &quot;Billboard&quot; rock charts. At this point Osbourne expressed his fatigue with touring, and proclaimed his &quot;retirement tour&quot; (which was to be short-lived). It was called &quot;No More Tours&quot;, a pun on &quot;No More Tears&quot;. Alice in Chains&#x27; Mike Inez took over on bass and Kevin Jones played keyboards as Sinclair was touring with the Cult.

Osbourne&#x27;s entire CD catalogue was remastered and reissued in 1995. In 1995, Osbourne released &quot;Ozzmosis&quot; and returned to touring, dubbing his concert performances &quot;The Retirement Sucks Tour&quot;. The album reached number 4 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The RIAA certified the album gold and platinum in that same year, and double platinum in April 1999.

The line-up on &quot;Ozzmosis&quot; was Wylde, Butler (who had just quit Black Sabbath again), Steve Vai, and Hardline drummer Deen Castronovo, who later joined Journey. Keyboards were played by Rick Wakeman and producer Michael Beinhorn. The tour maintained Butler and Castronovo and saw Sinclair return, but a major line-up change was the introduction of former David Lee Roth guitarist Joe Holmes. Wylde was considering an offer to join Guns N&#x27; Roses. Unable to wait for a decision on Wylde&#x27;s departure, Osbourne replaced him. In early 1996, Butler and Castronovo left. Inez and Randy Castillo (Lita Ford, Mötley Crüe) filled in. Ultimately, Faith No More&#x27;s Mike Bordin and former Suicidal Tendencies and future Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo joined on drums and bass respectively. A greatest hits package, &quot;The Ozzman Cometh&quot;, was issued in 1997.

===Ozzfest===
Osbourne&#x27;s biggest financial success of the 1990s was a venture named Ozzfest, created and managed by his wife/manager Sharon and assisted by his son Jack. The first Ozzfest was held in Phoenix, Arizona, on 25 October 1996 and in Devore, California, on 26 October. Ozzfest was an instant hit with metal fans, helping many up-and-coming groups who were featured there to broad exposure and commercial success. Some acts shared the bill with a reformed Black Sabbath during the 1997 Ozzfest tour, beginning in West Palm Beach, Florida. Osbourne reunited with the original members of Sabbath in 1997 and has performed periodically with them since.

Since its beginning, five million people have attended Ozzfest which has grossed over US$100 million. The festival helped promote many new hard rock and heavy metal acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Ozzfest helped Osbourne to become the first hard rock and heavy metal star to hit $50 million in merchandise sales. In 2005, Osbourne and his wife Sharon starred in an MTV competition reality show entitled &quot;Battle for Ozzfest&quot;. A number of yet unsigned bands send one member to compete in a challenge to win a spot on the 2005 Ozzfest and a possible recording contract. Shortly after Ozzfest 2005, Osbourne announced that he will no longer headline Ozzfest. Although he announced his retirement from Ozzfest, Osbourne came back headlining the tour. In 2006 Osbourne closed the event for just over half the concerts, leaving the others to be closed by System of a Down. He also played the closing act for the second stage at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California on 1 July as well as Randalls Island, New York on 29 July. After the concert in Bristol, Virginia, Osbourne announced he would return for another year of Ozzfest in 2007.

Tickets for the 2007 tour were offered to fans free of charge, which led to some controversy. In 2008, Ozzfest was reduced to a one-day event in Dallas, where Osbourne played, along with Metallica and King Diamond. In 2010, the tour opened with a Jersey Shore spoof skit starring Osbourne. Osbourne appeared as the headliner closing the show after opening acts Halford and Mötley Crüe. The tour, though small (only six US venues and one UK venue were played), generated rave reviews.

===2000s===
&quot;Down to Earth&quot;, Osbourne&#x27;s first album of new studio material in six years, was released on 16 October 2001. A live album, &quot;Live at Budokan&quot;, followed in 2002. &quot;Down to Earth&quot;, which achieved platinum status in 2003, featured the single &quot;Dreamer&quot;, a song which peaked at number 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Mainstream Rock Tracks. In June 2002, Osbourne was invited to participate in the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, performing the Black Sabbath anthem &quot;Paranoid&quot; at the Party at the Palace concert in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. In 2003, Osbourne recruited former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted, though his time with Osbourne would be short. Osbourne&#x27;s former bassist Robert Trujillo replaced Newsted in Metallica during this same period.

On 8 December 2003, Osbourne was rushed into emergency surgery at Slough&#x27;s Wexham Park Hospital when he had an accident with his quad bike on his estate in Jordans, Buckinghamshire. Osbourne broke his collar bone, eight ribs, and a neck vertebra. An operation was performed to lift the collarbone, which was believed to be resting on a major artery and interrupting blood flow to the arm. Sharon later revealed that Osbourne had stopped breathing following the crash and was resuscitated by Osbourne&#x27;s then personal bodyguard, Sam Ruston. While in hospital, Osbourne achieved his first ever UK number one single, a duet of the Black Sabbath ballad, &quot;Changes&quot; with daughter Kelly. In doing so, he broke the record of the longest period between an artist&#x27;s first UK chart appearance (with Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Paranoid&quot;, number four in August 1970) and their first number one hit: a gap of 33 years. Since the quad accident, apart from some short-term memory problems, he fully recovered and headlined the 2004 Ozzfest, in the reunited Black Sabbath.

In March 2005, Osbourne released a box set called &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;. The first and second discs are collections of live performances, B-sides, demos and singles. The third disc contained duets and other odd tracks with other artists, including &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; with Miss Piggy. The fourth disc, is entirely new material where Osbourne covers his favourite songs by his biggest influences and favourite bands, including the Beatles, John Lennon, David Bowie and others. In November 2005, Osbourne released the covers album &quot;Under Cover&quot;, featuring 10 songs from the fourth disc of &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; and 3 more songs. Osbourne&#x27;s band for this album included Alice in Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell, bassist Chris Wyse and Faith No More drummer Mike Bordin.

Osbourne also helped judge the 2005 UK series of &quot;the X-Factor&quot; where his wife Sharon was one of the main judges. In March 2006, he said that he hoped to release a new studio album soon with longtime on-off guitarist, Zakk Wylde of Black Label Society. In October 2006, it was announced that Tony Iommi, Ronnie James Dio, Vinny Appice, and Geezer Butler would be touring together again, though not as Black Sabbath but under the moniker &quot;Heaven &amp; Hell&quot;, the title of Dio&#x27;s first Black Sabbath album.

Osbourne&#x27;s next album, titled &quot;Black Rain&quot;, was released on 22 May 2007. His first new studio album in almost six years, it featured a more serious tone than previous albums. &quot;I thought I&#x27;d never write again without any stimulation... But you know what? Instead of picking up the bottle I just got honest and said, &#x27;I don&#x27;t want life to go [to pieces]&#x27;&quot;, Osbourne stated to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine.

Osbourne revealed in July 2009 that he was currently seeking a new guitar player. While he states that he has not fallen out with Zakk Wylde, he said he felt his songs were beginning to sound like Black Label Society and fancied a change. In August 2009, Osbourne performed at the gaming festival BlizzCon with a new guitarist in his line-up, Gus G. Osbourne also provided his voice and likeness to the video game &quot;Brütal Legend&quot; character The Guardian of Metal. In November, Slash featured Osbourne on vocals in his single &quot;Crucify the Dead&quot;, and Osbourne with wife Sharon were guest hosts on &quot;WWE Raw&quot;. In December, Osbourne announced he would be releasing a new album titled &quot;Soul Sucka&quot; with Gus G, Tommy Clufetos on drums, and Blasko on bass. Negative fan feedback was brought to Osbourne&#x27;s attention regarding the album title. In respect of fan opinion, on 29 March Osbourne announced his album would be renamed &quot;Scream&quot;.

===2010s===

On 13 April 2010, Osbourne announced the release date for &quot;Scream&quot; would be 15 June 2010. The release date was later changed to a week later. A single from the album, &quot;Let Me Hear You Scream&quot;, debuted on 14 April 2010 episode of &quot;&quot;. The song spent eight weeks on the Billboard Rock Songs chart, peaking at No. 7.

On 9 August 2010, Osbourne announced that the second single from the album would be &quot;Life Won&#x27;t Wait&quot; and the video for the song would be directed by his son Jack. When asked of his opinions on &quot;Scream&quot; in an interview, Osbourne announced that he is &quot;already thinking about the next album&quot;. Osbourne&#x27;s current drummer, Tommy Clufetos, has reflected this sentiment, saying that &quot;We are already coming up with new ideas backstage, in the hotel rooms and at soundcheck and have a bunch of ideas recorded&quot;. In October 2014, Osbourne released &quot;Memoirs of a Madman&quot;, a collection celebrating his entire solo career. A CD version contained 17 singles from across his career, never before compiled together. The DVD version contained music videos, live performances, and interviews.

In August 2015, Epic Records president Sylvia Rhone confirmed with &quot;Billboard&quot; that Osbourne was working on another studio album; in September 2019, Osbourne announced he had finished the album in four weeks following his collaboration with Post Malone. In April 2017, it was announced that guitarist Zakk Wylde would reunite with Osbourne for a summer tour to mark the 30th anniversary of their first collaboration on 1988&#x27;s &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot;. The first show of the tour took place on 14 July at the Rock USA Festival in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

On 6 November 2017, Osbourne was announced as the headline act for the Sunday of the 2018 Download Festival held annually at Donington Park in Leicestershire, England. Having previously graced the main stage in previous years fronting Black Sabbath, this will be his first-ever Download headline solo appearance. The Download Festival set comes as part of Osbourne&#x27;s final world tour announcement that morning.

On 6 February 2018, Osbourne announced that he would embark on his final world tour dubbed &quot;No More Tours II&quot;, a reference to his 1992 tour of the same name, with support from Stone Sour on the North American portion of the tour. He later insisted that he would not retire, &quot;It&#x27;s &#x27;No More Tours&#x27;, so I&#x27;m just not doing world tours anymore. I&#x27;m still going to be doing gigs, but I&#x27;m not going on tour for six months at a time anymore. I&#x27;d like to spend some time at home.&quot;

On 6 September 2019, Osbourne featured on the song &quot;Take What You Want&quot; by Post Malone. The song would peak on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts at number 8, making it Osbourne&#x27;s first US Top 10 single in 30 years since he was featured on Lita Ford&#x27;s &quot;Close My Eyes Forever&quot;.

=== 2020s ===
On 21 February 2020, Osbourne released his first solo album in almost ten years, &quot;Ordinary Man&quot;, which received positive reviews from music critics and debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart. A few days after the release, Osbourne told iHeartRadio that he wanted to make another album with Andrew Watt, the main producer of &quot;Ordinary Man&quot;. One week after the release of the album, an 8-bit video game dedicated to Osbourne was released, called &quot;Legend of Ozzy.&quot; Osbourne has started working on his follow up album, once again with Andrew Watt. In November 2021, Sony announced that Osbourne&#x27;s album would be released within six months; it was also announced that Zakk Wylde will have full involvement in the album following his absence on &quot;Ordinary Man&quot;. On 24 June 2022, Osbourne announced his thirteenth album would be titled &quot;Patient Number 9&quot; and released the title track along with an accompanying music video that same day. The album was released on 9 September 2022.

In January 2023, Osbourne announced that the European leg of the No More Tours II would be canceled after almost two years of being postponed. Osbourne effectively retired from touring, citing his accident in 2019 which resulted in the singer suffering spinal damage, while affirming his plan to continue smaller-scale live performances as his health permitted. In September 2023, he revealed that he was working on a new album with a planned 2024 release while also preparing to go on the road following a successful spinal surgery earlier that month.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Osbourne at number 112 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

===Other production work===
Osbourne achieved greater celebrity status via his own brand of reality television. &quot;The Osbournes&quot;, a series featuring the domestic life of Osbourne and his family (wife Sharon, children Jack and Kelly, occasional appearances from his son Louis, but eldest daughter Aimee did not participate). The program became one of MTV&#x27;s greatest hits. It premiered on 5 March 2002, and the final episode aired on 21 March 2005. 

The success of &quot;The Osbournes&quot; led Osbourne and the rest of his family to host the 30th Annual American Music Awards in January 2003. The night was marked with constant &quot;bleeping&quot; due to some of the lewd and raunchy remarks made by Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne. Presenter Patricia Heaton walked out midway in disgust. On 20 February 2008, Ozzy, Sharon, Kelly and Jack Osbourne hosted the 2008 BRIT Awards held at Earls Court, London. Ozzy appeared in a TV commercial for &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not Butter!&quot; which began airing in the UK in February 2006.

Osbourne appears in a commercial for the online video game &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. He was also featured in the music video game &quot;Guitar Hero World Tour&quot; as a playable character. He becomes unlocked upon completing &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot; and &quot;Crazy Train&quot; in the vocalist career. The 2002 dark fantasy combat flight simulator &quot;Savage Skies&quot; was initially developed under the title &quot;Ozzy&#x27;s Black Skies&quot; and was to feature his likeness as well as songs from both his stint in Black Sabbath as well as his solo career, but licensing issues forced developer iRock Interactive to re-tool the game and release it without the Osbourne branding.
In October 2009, Osbourne published &quot;I Am Ozzy&quot;, his autobiography. Osbourne says ghost writer Chris Ayres told the singer he has enough material for a second book. A movie adaptation of &quot;I Am Ozzy&quot; is also in the works, and Osbourne says he hopes &quot;an unknown guy from England&quot; will get the role over an established actor, while Sharon stated she would choose established English actress Carey Mulligan to play her.

A documentary film about Osbourne&#x27;s life and career, entitled &quot;God Bless Ozzy Osbourne&quot;, premiered in April 2011 at the Tribeca Film Festival and was released on DVD in November 2011. The film was produced by Osbourne&#x27;s son Jack. On 15 May 2013 Osbourne, along with the current members of Black Sabbath, appeared in an episode of &quot;&quot; titled &quot;Skin in the Game&quot;. The History Channel premiered a comedy reality television series starring Ozzy Osbourne and his son Jack Osbourne on 24 July 2016, named &quot;Ozzy &amp; Jack&#x27;s World Detour&quot;. During each episode Ozzy and Jack visit one or more sites to learn about history from experts, and explore unusual or quirky aspects of their background.

Osbourne appeared in a November 2017 episode of &quot;Gogglebox&quot; along with other UK celebrities such as Ed Sheeran, former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn as part of Channel 4 and Cancer Research UK&#x27;s &quot;Stand Up to Cancer&quot; fundraising campaign. In November 2017, Osbourne entered into a new realm of sponsorship as he signed on as an ambassador of a rock-themed online casino known as Metal Casino, which was founded by metal music fans in August 2017. In February 2019, Osbourne&#x27;s merchandising partner announced that Ozzy would have his own branded online slots game as part of the NetEnt Rocks music-themed portfolio.

===Black Sabbath reunions===

It was announced on 11 November 2011 during a news conference at the Whisky a Go Go club on West Hollywood&#x27;s Sunset Strip that the original Black Sabbath lineup of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward would reunite for a world tour and new album, to be produced by Rick Rubin. Ward dropped out for contractual reasons, but the project continued with Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s Brad Wilk stepping in for Ward on drums. On 21 May 2012, Black Sabbath played at the O2 Academy in their hometown Birmingham, their first concert since their reunion. The album, entitled &quot;13&quot;, was released on 11 June 2013, and topped both the UK Albums Chart and the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In January 2016, the band began a farewell tour, titled &quot;The End&quot;, signifying the final performances of Black Sabbath. 
The final shows of The End tour took place at the Genting Arena in their home city of Birmingham, England on 2 and 4 February 2017, with Tommy Clufetos replacing Bill Ward as the drummer for the final show.

On 8 August 2022, Osbourne and Iommi made a surprise appearance, during the closing ceremony of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. This marked Osbourne&#x27;s first live performance in three years, following a period of ill health.

On 5 February 2025, Osbourne announced his final show alongside his band Black Sabbath, for a charity show at Villa Park in Birmingham on 5 July.

==Controversies==
Throughout his career, many religious groups have accused Osbourne of being a negative influence on teenagers, stating that his genre of rock music has been used to glorify Satanism. Scholar Christopher M. Moreman compared the controversy to those levelled against the occultist Aleister Crowley. Both were demonised by the media and some religious groups for their antics. Although Osbourne tempts the comparison with his song &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot;, he denies being a Satanist; conversely, it has been reported that Osbourne is a member of the Church of England and that he prays before taking the stage each night before every concert.

In 1981, after signing his first solo career record deal, Osbourne bit the head off a dove during a meeting with CBS Records executives in Los Angeles. Apparently, he had planned to release doves into the air as a sign of peace, but due to being intoxicated at the time, he instead grabbed a dove and bit its head off. He then spat the head out, with blood still dripping from his lips. Due to its controversy, the head-biting act has been parodied and alluded to several times throughout his career and is part of what made Osbourne famous.
On 20 January 1982, Osbourne bit the head off a bat that he thought was rubber while performing at the Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Des Moines, Iowa. According to a 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article, the bat was alive at the time; however, 17-year-old Mark Neal, who threw it onto the stage, said it was brought to the show dead. According to Osbourne in the booklet to the 2002 edition of &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, the bat was not only alive but managed to bite him, resulting in Osbourne being treated for rabies. On 20 January 2019, Osbourne commemorated the 37th anniversary of the bat incident by offering an &quot;Ozzy Plush Bat&quot; toy &quot;with detachable head&quot; for sale on his personal web-store. The site claimed the first batch of toys sold out within hours.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1983, Canadian youth James Jollimore killed a woman and her two sons in Halifax, Nova Scotia, after listening to the &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot; song. A friend of the murderer quoted: &quot;Jimmy said that every time he listened to the song, he felt strange inside ... He said when he heard it on New Year&#x27;s Eve, he went out and stabbed someone&quot;.

In 1984, California teenager John McCollum committed suicide while listening to Osbourne&#x27;s &quot;Suicide Solution&quot;. The song deals with the dangers of alcohol misuse. McCollum&#x27;s suicide led to allegations that Osbourne promoted suicide in his songs. McCollum had clinical depression. His parents sued Osbourne (&quot;McCollum v. CBS&quot;) for their son&#x27;s death, saying the lyrics in the song, &quot;Where to hide, suicide is the only way out. Don&#x27;t you know what it&#x27;s really about?&quot; convinced McCollum to commit suicide. The family&#x27;s lawyer suggested that Osbourne should be criminally charged for encouraging a young person to commit suicide, but the courts ruled in Osbourne&#x27;s favour, saying there was no connection between the song and McCollum&#x27;s suicide. Osbourne was sued for the same reason in 1991 (&quot;Waller v. Osbourne&quot;), by the parents of Michael Waller, for $9 million, but the courts once again ruled in Osbourne&#x27;s favour.

In lawsuits filed in 2000 and 2002 which were dismissed by the courts in 2003, former band members Bob Daisley, Lee Kerslake, and Phil Soussan stated that Osbourne was delinquent in paying them royalties and had denied them due credit on albums they played on. In November 2003, a Federal Appeals Court unanimously upheld the dismissal by the US District Court for the Central District of California of the lawsuit brought by Daisley and Kerslake. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Osbourne does not owe any royalties or credit to the former band members who were let go in 1981. To resolve further issues, management chose to replace Daisley and Kerslake&#x27;s contributions on the original masters, replacing them with Robert Trujillo on bass and Mike Bordin on drums. The albums were then reissued. The original tracks have since been restored in accordance with the 30th anniversary of those albums.

In July 2010, Osbourne and Tony Iommi decided to discontinue the court proceedings over ownership of the Black Sabbath trademark. As reported to &quot;Blabbermouth&quot;, &quot;Both parties are glad to put this behind them and to cooperate for the future and would like it to be known that the issue was never personal, it was always business.&quot;

==Personal life==

Osbourne has five biological and two adopted children.

In 1971, Osbourne met his first wife Thelma Riley at the Rum Runner, the Birmingham nightclub where she worked. They were married later that year and children Jessica and Louis were soon born. Osbourne also adopted Riley&#x27;s five year old son Elliot from a previous relationship. Osbourne later referred to his first marriage as &quot;a terrible mistake&quot;. His drug and alcohol use, coupled with his frequent absences while touring with Black Sabbath, took their toll on his family life; his children later complained that he was not a good father. In the 2011 documentary film &quot;God Bless Ozzy Osbourne&quot;, produced by his son Jack, Osbourne admitted that he could not even remember when Louis and Jessica were born.

Osbourne married his manager Sharon Arden on 4 July 1982 and the couple had three children together: Aimee (born 2 September 1983), Kelly (born 27 October 1984), and Jack (born 8 November 1985). After Jack&#x27;s birth Osbourne had a vasectomy. He later confessed that the well-known &quot;Fourth of July&quot; Independence Day date was chosen so that he would never forget his anniversary. Guitarist Randy Rhoads predicted in 1981 that the couple would &quot;probably get married someday&quot; despite their constant bickering and the fact that Osbourne was still married to Thelma at the time. Osbourne has multiple grandchildren.

Osbourne wrote a song for his daughter Aimee, which appeared as a B-side on the album &quot;Ozzmosis&quot;. At the end of the song, said daughter can be heard saying &quot;I&#x27;ll always be your angel&quot;, referring to the song&#x27;s chorus lyrics. The song &quot;My Little Man&quot;, which appears on &quot;Ozzmosis&quot;, was written about his son Jack. The Osbourne family divide their time between homes in Buckinghamshire and Los Angeles.

Though Osbourne has long been accused of being a Satanist, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 1992 that he was a practicing member of the Church of England and prayed before each show. In 2002, Osbourne and wife Sharon were invited to the White House Correspondents&#x27; Association dinner by Fox News Channel correspondent Greta Van Susteren for that year&#x27;s event. Then-President George W. Bush noted Osbourne&#x27;s presence by joking, &quot;The thing about Ozzy is, he&#x27;s made a lot of big hit recordings – &#x27;Party with the Animals&#x27;, &#x27;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&#x27;, &#x27;Facing Hell&#x27;, &#x27;Black Skies&#x27; and &#x27;Bloodbath in Paradise&#x27;. Ozzy, Mom loves your stuff.&quot;

In 2010, during an interview on the Howard Stern Show, Ozzy said that it took him 19 attempts to get his driver’s license because he was so drunk.

Ozzy and his wife are one of the UK&#x27;s richest couples, according to the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List. They ranked at number 458 in 2005, with an estimated £100 million earned from recording, touring, and TV shows. Osbourne has over 15 tattoos, the most famous of which are the letters O-Z-Z-Y across the knuckles of his left hand. This was his first tattoo, created by himself as a teenager with a sewing needle and pencil lead. A longtime fan of the comedy troupe Monty Python, in a 2010 interview with &quot;Us Weekly&quot; Osbourne stated, &quot;My favourite movie is &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;&quot;. Osbourne suffered minor burns after a small house fire in January 2013. On his 65th birthday on 3 December 2013, he asked fans to celebrate his birthday by donating to the Royal Marsden cancer charity in London.

On 6 February 2019, Osbourne was hospitalised in an undisclosed location on his doctor&#x27;s advice due to flu complications, postponing the European leg of his &quot;No More Tours II&quot; tour. The issue was described as a &quot;severe upper-respiratory infection&quot; following a bout with the flu which his doctor feared could develop into pneumonia, given the physicality of the live performances and an extensive travel schedule throughout Europe in harsh winter conditions. Pneumonia targets the airway and breathing and is frequently fatal in elderly patients, necessitating the preventive measures.

By 12 February 2019, Osbourne had been moved to intensive care. Tour promoters Live Nation said in a statement that they were hopeful that Osbourne would be &quot;fit and healthy&quot; and able to honour tour dates in Australia and New Zealand in March. Osbourne later cancelled the tour entirely, and ultimately all shows scheduled for 2019, after sustaining serious injuries from a fall in his Los Angeles home while still recovering from pneumonia. He was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in February 2019, which he publicly revealed in January 2020. He lost his ability to walk due to the disease.

In 2020, Osbourne also revealed that he had the smoking-induced lung condition, emphysema.

In February 2020, Osbourne cancelled the 2020 North American tour, seeking treatment in Switzerland until April.

===Drug and alcohol use===
Osbourne has misused alcohol and other drugs for most of his adult life. He admitted to &quot;Sounds&quot; in 1978, &quot;I get high, I get fucked up ... what the hell&#x27;s wrong with getting fucked up? There must be something wrong with the system if so many people have to get fucked up ... I never take dope or anything before I go on stage. I&#x27;ll smoke a joint or whatever afterwards.&quot; Black Sabbath bandmate Tony Iommi said that while all the band were involved with alcohol and other drugs to various degrees in the 1970s, Osbourne had the unhealthiest lifestyle of them all. Despite this, said Iommi, he was typically the only one left standing when the others were &quot;out for the count&quot;. Longtime guitarist Zakk Wylde has attributed Osbourne&#x27;s longevity in spite of decades of substance misuse to &quot;a very special kind of fortitude that&#x27;s bigger than King Kong and Godzilla combined... seriously, he&#x27;s hard as nails, man!&quot;

Osbourne&#x27;s first experience with cocaine was in early 1971 at a hotel in Denver, Colorado, after a show Black Sabbath had done with Mountain. He states that Mountain&#x27;s guitarist, Leslie West, introduced him to the drug. Though West was reluctant to take credit for introducing Osbourne to cocaine, Osbourne remembers the experience quite clearly: &quot;When you come from Aston and you fall in love with cocaine, you when you started. It&#x27;s like having your first fuck!&quot; Osbourne says that upon first trying the drug, &quot;The world went a bit fuzzy after that.&quot;

Osbourne claimed to have taken LSD often for two years while in Black Sabbath. During the end of his time with the band, he said he &quot;got very drunk and very stoned every single day.&quot;

Osbourne&#x27;s drug and alcohol misuse have, at times, caused friction within his band. Don Airey, keyboardist for Osbourne during his early solo career, has said that the vocalist&#x27;s substance-misuse issues were what ultimately caused him to leave the band. In his memoir &quot;Off the Rails&quot;, former bassist Rudy Sarzo detailed the frustrations felt by him and his bandmates as they coped with life on the road with the vocalist, who was in a state of near-constant inebriation and was often so hungover that he would refuse to perform. When he was able to perform, his voice was often so damaged from cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs that the performance suffered. Many shows on the American leg of the 1981-82 &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; tour were simply cancelled, and the members of his band quickly began to tire of the unpredictability, coupled with the often violent mood swings he was prone to when either drunk or high.

Osbourne claims in his autobiography that he was invited in 1981 to a meeting with the head of CBS Europe in Germany. Intoxicated, he decided to lighten the mood by performing a striptease on the table and then kissing the record executive on the lips. According to his wife Sharon, he had actually performed a goose-step up and down the table and urinated in the executive&#x27;s wine, but was too drunk to remember.

On 18 February 1982, while wearing his future wife Sharon&#x27;s dress for a photoshoot near the Alamo, Osbourne drunkenly urinated on a cenotaph erected in honour of those who died at the Battle of the Alamo in Texas, across the street from the actual building. A police officer arrested Osbourne, and he was subsequently banned from the city of San Antonio for a decade. Osbourne had been on a long drinking binge and earlier that same day had drunkenly fired his entire band, including Randy Rhoads, after they had informed him that they would not participate in a planned live album of Black Sabbath songs. He also physically attacked Rhoads and Rudy Sarzo in a hotel bar that morning, and Sharon informed the band that she feared he had &quot;finally snapped&quot;. Osbourne later had no memory of firing his band and the tour continued, though his relationship with Rhoads never fully recovered. In May 1984, Osbourne was arrested in Memphis, Tennessee, again for public intoxication. The most notorious incident came in August 1989, when Sharon claimed that Ozzy had tried to strangle her after returning home from the Moscow Music Peace Festival, in a haze of alcohol and drugs. The incident led Ozzy to six months in rehabilitation, after which time, Sharon regained her faith in her husband and did not press charges.

Though he has managed to remain clean and sober for extended periods in recent years, Osbourne has frequently commented on his former wild lifestyle, expressing bewilderment at his own survival through 40 years of drug and alcohol misuse. Upon being fired from Black Sabbath in 1979, Osbourne spent the next three months locked in his hotel room taking vast amounts of alcohol and other drugs all day, every day. He claims that he would certainly have died if his future wife Sharon had not offered to manage him as a solo artist.

In 2003, Osbourne told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; how he was nearly incapacitated by medication prescribed by a Beverly Hills doctor. The doctor was alleged to have prescribed 13,000 doses of 32 drugs in one year. However, after a nine-year investigation by the Medical Board of California, the Beverly Hills physician was exonerated of all charges of excessive prescribing.

Osbourne experienced tremors for some years and linked them to his continuous drug misuse. In May 2005, he found out it was actually Parkin syndrome, a genetic condition, the symptoms of which are similar to Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Osbourne will have to take daily medication for the rest of his life to combat the involuntary shudders associated with the condition. Osbourne has also shown symptoms of mild hearing loss, as depicted in the television show, &quot;The Osbournes&quot;, where he often asks his family to repeat what they say. At the TEDMED Conference in October 2010, scientists from Knome, a Massachusetts human genome interpretation company, joined Osbourne on stage to discuss their analysis of Osbourne&#x27;s whole genome, which shed light on how the famously hard-living rocker has survived decades of drug, alcohol, and tobacco misuse.

In April 2013, Osbourne revealed through Facebook that he had resumed smoking, drinking and doing drugs for the past year and a half, stating he &quot;was in a very dark place&quot; but said he had been sober again since early March. He also apologised to Sharon, his family, friends, bandmates and his fans for his &quot;insane&quot; behaviour during that period. In a February 2021 interview with &quot;Variety&quot;, Ozzy and his son Jack (who has been sober for 17 years) opened up about their recovery. Ozzy revealed he had been sober for about seven years.

==Legacy==
Osbourne is considered an icon of hard rock music, and one of the founders of heavy metal music through his work with Black Sabbath. He dislikes being categorized as metal, stating that while his band &quot;plays heavy&quot;, other bands that are considered metal are &quot;really heavy&quot;. &quot;When you get pigeonholed with a certain [genre], it can be very difficult to do something a bit lighter or an acoustic track or whatever you want to do. Back in the day, it was always just rock music. It’s still just rock music.&quot;

* Ozzy Osbourne – vocals 
* Zakk Wylde – lead guitar, backing vocals

In addition, that year a bronze star honouring Osbourne was placed on Broad Street in Birmingham, England while Osbourne watched. On 18 May Osbourne had received notice that he would be the first inductee into The Birmingham Walk of Stars. He was presented the award by the Lord Mayor of Birmingham. &quot;I am really honoured&quot;, he said, &quot;All my family is here and I thank everyone for this reception—I&#x27;m absolutely knocked out&quot;.

In 2008 Osbourne was crowned with the prestigious &quot;Living Legend&quot; award in the Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards. Past recipients include Alice Cooper, Lemmy, Jimmy Page. Slash, the former Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist, presented the award. In 2010 Osbourne won the &quot;Literary Achievement&quot; honour for his memoir, &quot;I Am Ozzy&quot;, at the &quot;Guys Choice Awards&quot; at &quot;Sony Pictures Studio&quot; in Culver City, California. Osbourne was presented with the award by Sir Ben Kingsley. The book debuted at No. 2 on the New York Times&#x27; hardcover non-fiction best-seller list. Osbourne was also a judge for the 6th, 10th and 11th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists&#x27; careers. In May 2015, Osbourne received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors at a ceremony held at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London. In 2016, Osbourne had a tram named after him in his home city of Birmingham.

In April 2021, Osbourne was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame for his various appearances, notably for his appearance at WrestleMania 2 in 1986 when he and Lou Albano managed The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and The Dynamite Kid) in their WWF Tag Team Championship win over The Dream Team (Greg Valentine and Brutus Beefcake).

<doc id="85408" wikidata="Q1490210" url="?curid=85408" title="Levana">
<text>Levana (from Latin &quot;levare,&quot; &quot;to lift&quot;) is an ancient Roman goddess involved in rituals pertaining to childbirth. Augustine says that &quot;dea Levana&quot; is invoked when the child is lifted &quot;de terra&quot;, from the earth or ground. Her function may be paralleled by the Greek &quot;Artemis Orthia&quot;, if interpreted as the Artemis who lifts or raises children.

It is sometimes supposed that Levana was invoked in a ceremony by which the father lifted the child to acknowledge it as his own, but the existence of such a ceremony is based on tenuous evidence and contradicted by Roman law pertaining to legitimacy of birth. More likely, Levana was the goddess who oversaw the lifting of the child by the midwife immediately after birth. Kneeling or squatting was a more common position for childbirth in antiquity, and the newborn probably came to rest on the ground before the umbilical cord was cut.

==Modern use==
Thomas De Quincey&#x27;s prose poem &quot;Levana and Our Ladies of Sorrow&quot; begins with a discussion of the role of Levana in Roman religion and goes on to invent three companions for her: Mater Lachrymarum, Our Lady of Tears; Mater Suspiriorum, Our Lady of Sighs; and Mater Tenebrarum, Our Lady of Darkness.

Levana is the name of an infant and child safety product manufacturer. The brand was established in 2007 and concentrates on electrical means of protection.

In the Lunar Chronicles by Marissa Meyer, Levana is the name of the current queen of Luna (a human colony on the moon).

<doc id="85409" wikidata="Q654354" url="?curid=85409" title="Shenmue (video game)">
<text>is a 1999 action-adventure game developed by AM2 of CRI and published by Sega for the Dreamcast. It follows the teenage martial artist Ryo Hazuki as he sets out in revenge for the murder of his father in 1980s Yokosuka, Japan. The player explores an open world, fighting opponents in brawler battles and encountering quick time events. The environmental detail was considered unprecedented, with numerous interactive 3D objects, a day-and-night system, variable weather effects, non-player characters with daily schedules and various minigames.

After developing several successful Sega arcade games, including &quot;Hang-On&quot; (1985), &quot;Out Run&quot; (1986) and &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; (1993), the director, Yu Suzuki, wanted to create a longer experience, and conceived &quot;Shenmue&quot; as a multi-part epic. In 1996, Sega AM2 began work on a role-playing game for the Sega Saturn set in the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; world. Development moved to the Dreamcast in 1997 and the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; connection was dropped. &quot;Shenmue&quot; became the most expensive video game ever developed at the time, with an estimated production and marketing cost of , though this also covered some of &quot;Shenmue II&quot; (2001).

Despite sales of 1.2 million, &quot;Shenmue&quot; did not recoup its development cost and was a commercial failure. It received positive reviews for its graphics, soundtrack and ambition, though its slow pace and emphasis on mundane detail divided players. It attracted a cult following, appeared in several lists of the greatest video games of all time, and is credited for pioneering game mechanics such as quick time events and open worlds. Later appraisal has been mixed, with criticism for the controls, voice acting and slow pace.

After the release of &quot;Shenmue II&quot;, further &quot;Shenmue&quot; games entered development hell and Suzuki left Sega. In 2018, Sega released high-definition ports of &quot;Shenmue&quot; and &quot;Shenmue II&quot; for multiple formats. Following a successful crowdfunding campaign, Suzuki developed &quot;Shenmue III&quot; independently; it was released for the PlayStation 4 and Windows in 2019. An anime adaptation of &quot;Shenmue&quot; premiered in 2022.

== Gameplay ==
The player controls the teenage martial artist Ryo Hazuki as he investigates his father&#x27;s murder in Yokosuka in 1986. They must explore the open world, searching for clues, examining objects and talking to non-player characters. Occasionally, Ryo battles opponents in fighting sequences similar to Sega&#x27;s &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series; outside of combat, players can practice moves to increase their power. In quick time events, the player must press the right button within a time limit to succeed.

&quot;Shenmue&quot; features a persistent world with level of detail considered unprecedented for games at the time. Shops open and close, buses run to timetables, and characters have their own routines, each in accordance with the in-game clock. The player can inspect objects including drawers, cabinets and shelves, though not all objects are interactive. Ryo receives a daily allowance which can be spent on items including food, raffle tickets, audio cassettes and capsule toys. There are several minigames; in the local arcade, for example, Ryo can throw darts or play complete versions of the Sega arcade games &quot;Hang-On&quot; and &quot;Space Harrier&quot;. Later in the game, Ryo gets a part-time job at the docks and must ferry crates between warehouses and compete in races using a forklift. &quot;Edge&quot; described &quot;Shenmue&quot; as &quot;a game of middle management, often composed of the unglamorous daily grinds—being home for bedtime, wisely spending money earned from a day job, or training combat moves through lonely practice—that other games bypass&quot;.

== Plot ==
In Yokosuka, Japan, 1986, the teenage martial arts student Ryo Hazuki returns to his family dojo to witness a confrontation between his father, Iwao, and a Chinese man, Lan Di. Lan Di easily incapacitates Ryo, and threatens to kill him unless Iwao gives him a mysterious stone artifact, the dragon mirror. Iwao tells him the mirror is buried under the cherry blossom tree outside. As his men recover the mirror, Lan Di mentions a man he claims Iwao killed in China. He delivers a finishing blow and Iwao dies in Ryo&#x27;s arms.

Ryo swears revenge on Lan Di and asks locals for information. As he is about to run out of leads, a letter addressed to Ryo&#x27;s father arrives from a Chinese man, Zhu Yuanda, suggesting he seek the aid of Master Chen, who works at Yokosuka Harbor. Through Chen and his son Guizhang, Ryo learns that the mirror taken by Lan Di is one of two. He locates the second, the phoenix mirror, in a hidden basement beneath the family dojo.

Chen reveals that Lan Di has left Japan for Hong Kong. Ryo borrows money to buy a boat ticket from a disreputable travel agency. When he goes to collect the ticket, he is ambushed by Chai, a member of Lan Di&#x27;s criminal organization, the Chi You Men, who destroys his ticket. Ryo learns that the Chi You Men is connected to the local harbor gang, the Mad Angels, and takes a job at the harbor as a forklift driver to investigate. After he causes trouble, the Mad Angels kidnap his schoolfriend Nozomi. Ryo rescues her and makes a deal with the Mad Angels leader to beat up Guizhang in exchange for a meeting with Lan Di. Ryo realizes the deal is a trap and teams up with Guizhang to defeat the Mad Angels.

Ryo arranges to take a boat to Hong Kong with Guizhang. On the day of departure, they are attacked by Chai. Ryo defeats him, but Guizhang is injured and urges Ryo to go without him, saying he will meet him in China later. Chen advises Ryo to seek the help of a martial artist in Hong Kong named Lishao Tao. Ryo boards the boat and leaves for Hong Kong.

==Development==

&quot;Shenmue&quot; was created by Yu Suzuki. After joining Sega in 1983, Suzuki created several successful arcade games including &quot;Hang-On&quot; (1985)&quot;, Out Run&quot; (1986) and &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; (1993). In comparison to arcade games, where the ideal experience is only a few minutes long, Suzuki wanted to make a longer experience and researched role-playing games (RPGs).

To test camera, combat and conversation systems, Suzuki and Sega AM2 built a prototype Sega Saturn game, &quot;The Old Man and the Peach Tree,&quot; about a young man, Taro, seeking a martial arts grandmaster in 1950s Luoyang, China. Taro brings an old man a peach in exchange for information about the grandmaster; at the end of the game, the man skillfully skips stones across water to hunt fish, revealing that he is the grandmaster.

In 1996, AM2 began developing a 3D Saturn RPG with the working title &quot;Guppy&quot;. This became &quot;Virtua Fighter RPG: Akira&#x27;s Story&quot;, an RPG starring the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; character Akira. AM2 planned a &quot;cinematic&quot; approach, including voice acting and elaborate combat sequences. Suzuki researched locations in China, and constructed four acts with the themes &quot;sadness&quot;, &quot;fight&quot;, &quot;departure&quot; and &quot;starting afresh&quot;. In this version of the story, Akira would overcome his grief following his father&#x27;s death, travel to China, defeat an antagonist, and begin a journey with a new friend. Suzuki recruited a screenwriter, a playwright and film directors to write the multi-part story, which &quot;IGN&quot; described as a &quot;revenge epic in the tradition of Chinese cinema&quot;.

In 1997, development moved to Sega&#x27;s upcoming console, the Dreamcast. In 1998, the Sega of America vice president, Bernie Stolar, told &quot;Next Generation&quot; that Suzuki&#x27;s next project would &quot;rock the gaming world&quot;. That year, to better market the game as a Dreamcast &quot;killer app&quot;, the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; connection was dropped and Suzuki announced the working title &quot;Project Berkley&quot;. By the time of the Dreamcast&#x27;s release that November, it had been retitled &quot;Shenmue&quot;. Sega announced that &quot;Shenmue&quot; was so unique it belonged to a new genre it termed &quot;full reactive eyes entertainment&quot; or &quot;FREE&quot;.AM2 focused on developing the game world, creating a large open environment with minigames and subquests. The setting is modeled on Dobuita in Yokosuka, Japan. The team worked with interior decorators to design more than 1,200 rooms and locations, and created over 300 characters, each with names, personalities and relationships, some modeled on Sega employees, with detailed clay models as animation references. Meteorological records of 1986 Yokosuka were used to create algorithmically generated weather and day-and-night cycles. The cut scenes are rendered in real time, without full-motion video (FMV), and motion capture was used to capture the movements of Budō (Japanese martial arts) experts. To fit the material onto a manageable number of discs, AM2 developed a new type of data compression.

In 1999, AM2 focused on fixing bugs, finding hundreds each day. At the time, there were no bug-tracking systems, so the team tracked bugs with Excel spreadsheets; at one point, they had tracked over 10,000 unresolved bugs. On one occasion, several non-player characters became trapped in the convenience store where they had gone as part of their scripted routines; Suzuki&#x27;s solution was to widen the store&#x27;s door. The product placement of the Coca-Cola and Timex brands also created problems, as the companies had strict specifications for their implementation. Suzuki said the biggest challenge was management, with over 300 staff and no experience of large projects.

According to the localizer Jeremy Blaustein, &quot;Shenmue&quot;″s English localization was fraught with problems exacerbated by the project&#x27;s scale. At Suzuki&#x27;s insistence, the English voices were recorded in Japan, which greatly restricted the casting; Blaustein said &quot;we hired basically every single [English-speaking] person that exists [in Japan] and calls themselves a voice actor&quot;. The scripts were translated by several people, creating consistency problems, and arrived late, leaving no time for rewrites or proper direction.

&quot;Shenmue&quot; became the most expensive game ever developed at the time, reported to have cost Sega . In 2011, Suzuki said the figure was closer to $47 million including marketing. Development also covered some of &quot;Shenmue II&quot; (2001), which was completed for a smaller amount, and groundwork for future &quot;Shenmue&quot; games.

== Promotion and release ==
On November 27, 1998, Sega released the Dreamcast in Japan. The launch game &quot;Virtua Fighter 3tb&quot;, also directed by Suzuki, included a preview disc of &quot;Shenmue&quot; featuring FMV scenes and an interview with Suzuki, but no gameplay footage. On December 20, 1998, Sega unveiled &quot;Shenmue&quot; at a conference at the Yokohama International Assembly Hall and demonstrated its clock, weather and quick time event systems; fans could watch the conference online. Initial reactions were positive, with &quot;Edge&quot; saying it &quot;could be one of the most ambitious and important video game endeavours of the decade&quot;. However, the quick time events angered some fans, who had assumed &quot;Shenmue&quot; would only use &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;-style battles.

Sega announced a Japanese release date of April 1999, which was delayed to August 5. At the Tokyo Game Show that March, Sega announced that &quot;Shenmue&quot; would span multiple games and allowed the public to play it for the first time. At a Japanese consumer show on May 3, Sega demonstrated the facial animation and announced that non-player characters would have their own daily routines. Later that month, Sega showed &quot;Shenmue&quot; in America for the first time at the 1999 Game Developer&#x27;s Conference. It was playable the following week at the E3 trade fair in Los Angeles.

At a Japanese consumer conference on June 1, 1999, Sega announced a &quot;Shenmue&quot; promotion to coincide with a Dreamcast price drop. Sega distributed a limited-edition video, &quot;What&#x27;s Shenmue&quot;, with Dreamcast consoles and games, and a playable demo from August 1. The &quot;spoof&quot; demo has Ryo search a small area of Yokosuka for Sega&#x27;s managing director, Hidekazu Yukawa. Sega also announced that &quot;Shenmue&quot; had been delayed to October 28. On June 22, Sega announced a &quot;&quot;Shenmue&quot; subway tour&quot;, showing playable demos at Japanese train stations that August. NHK spent six months with the development team and broadcast a making-of documentary before the game&#x27;s release. 

At the end of September, Sega announced a release date for early 2000, before moving it to the final week of 1999. Sega released &quot;Shenmue&quot; on December 29, 1999, in Japan, November 7, 2000, in North America, and December 1, 2000, in Europe.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Shenmue&quot; held an average aggregate score of 89% on GameRankings. Critics praised its graphics, realism, soundtrack and ambition. &quot;IGN&quot; called it &quot;a gaming experience that no one, casual to hardcore gamer, can miss&quot;, and &quot;Eurogamer&quot; called it &quot;one of the most compelling and unusual gaming experiences ever created&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; wrote that though &quot;Shenmue&quot; is &quot;far from perfect&quot; it was &quot;revolutionary&quot; and &quot;worth experiencing—provided you have the time to invest&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; initially called the Japanese version a &quot;landmark&quot;; they later said the English version was not the &quot;milestone&quot; they had hoped for, but was &quot;involving, and ultimately rewarding&quot;.

Ed Lomas of the UK &quot;Official Dreamcast Magazine&quot; said the production values were &quot;astounding ... [&quot;Shenmue&quot;] is the most beautiful game ever made, no doubt about it.&quot; Though he acknowledged problems with controls, dated QTEs, script and voice acting, he felt the experience as a whole was &quot;incredible&quot;, particularly its immersion and the freedom to pursue the story at the player&#x27;s pace. Jeff Lundrigan of &quot;Next Generation&quot; wrote: &quot;Everyone on Earth owes it to themselves to play this. Some will enjoy it more than others, but no one will fail to recognize its magnificent production values and depth of design.&quot;

Several reviews criticized the invisible walls, abundance of cutscenes, English voice acting, and inability to progress without waiting for scheduled events. &quot;GameSpot&quot; wrote that by &quot;the time you&#x27;re driving forklifts and participating in the game&#x27;s QTE-filled conclusion, hours upon hours of boredom will have taken their toll&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; criticized the lack of action, writing: &quot;Determining your character&#x27;s next move requires little more than talking to someone, who will then tell you who to see or where to go ... All that&#x27;s left is a guy walking around an amazingly detailed environment. If I wanted to experience that, I could see it in another game with proven endless entertainment value. It&#x27;s called life.&quot;

=== Sales ===
&quot;Shenmue&quot; sold 260,000 copies in its first week of release in Japan. It eventually sold 1.2 million copies and became one of the Dreamcast&#x27;s highest-selling games. However, its sales did not cover its development cost and analysts consider it a major commercial failure. &quot;USgamer&quot; wrote that though the sales would have been a success for most games, only an &quot;impossible&quot; number of sales would have seen &quot;Shenmue&quot; turn a profit. According to &quot;GamesRadar&quot;, every Dreamcast owner would have needed to buy &quot;Shenmue&quot; twice for it to turn a profit, and so &quot;ironically it probably did as much to kill the Dreamcast as it did to cement its reputation&quot;. It contributed to Sega&#x27;s exit from the game console market following years of declining profits.

The &quot;Shenmue&quot; localizer, Jeremy Blaustein, likened the failure to the epic 1980 film &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, which went drastically over budget and was a commercial failure: &quot;Suzuki was coming off of huge past successes, and he was the man. And so this was going be &quot;the&quot; thing ... And everyone wanted a piece of that $70 million, you know? And of course that&#x27;s like the worst thing you could do, is to start out a project saying we&#x27;ve got all this money, and then just keep throwing more money at it.&quot; Peter Moore, the president of Sega of America at the time, said &quot;Shenmue&quot; sold &quot;extremely well&quot; but could not make a profit due to the Dreamcast&#x27;s limited installed base. The Dreamcast engineer and future Sega president Hideki Sato defended &quot;Shenmue&quot; as an &quot;investment [which] will someday be recouped&quot; because the lessons learnt during development could be applied to other games.

=== Awards ===
&quot;Shenmue&quot; received the Excellence Prize for &quot;Interactive Art&quot; at the 2000 Japan Media Arts Festival. &quot;Edge&quot; awarded it for &quot;Graphical Achievement&quot;, writing that Suzuki&#x27;s &quot;experiment in creating what is a complete, populated virtual world in which a game occurs proves to be a mighty success, particularly the &quot;breathtaking&quot; level of detail of the character models, and that never had there been &quot;such a convincing representation of real life&quot; in a video game. &quot;GameSpot&quot; named &quot;Shenmue&quot; the most disappointing console game of 2000, but awarded it the prize for &quot;Best Graphics, Technical&quot; for a console game, and nominated it for &quot;Best Adventure Game&quot;, &quot;Best Sound&quot;, and &quot;Best Graphics, Artistic&quot;. During the 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards in March 2001, &quot;Shenmue&quot; received the &quot;Console Innovation&quot; award, along with nominations for &quot;Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Character or Story Development&quot;, and &quot;Game Design&quot;.

== Influence and legacy ==
In 2009, the &quot;IGN&quot; Xbox editor Hilary Goldstein praised &quot;Shenmue&quot; for its &quot;great ideas&quot;, but said it was &quot;ultimately uninteresting&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; Nintendo&#x27;s Matt Casamassina felt it was &quot;more of a technical demo than a coherent game&quot;. However, &quot;IGN&quot; UK&#x27;s Martin Robinson described it as &quot;a deeply personal game&quot; that &quot;opened my eyes to a whole new world for video games, suggesting that they didn&#x27;t have to be about shooting aliens in the face, rescuing the princess or slaying orcs for hours on end — they could be about real people in a real place ... It&#x27;s the mundane moments that gave &quot;Shenmue&quot; its poetry.&quot;
In 2011, &quot;Empire&quot; wrote that &quot;the digital environment created by &quot;Shenmue&quot; was revolutionary at the time ... Even by today&#x27;s standards, its rich and affectionate vision of urban Japan is inspiring.&quot; In his 2010 book &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;, David McCarthy wrote of &quot;Shenmue&#x27;s&quot; &quot;paradigmatic impact on the entire video game industry&quot;. According to McCarthy, while it appears &quot;crude and blocky&quot; compared to modern games, &quot;Shenmue&quot; &quot;recreated the real world with ... attention to detail that has never been rivaled&quot;. In a 2014 retrospective, &quot;Edge&quot; wrote that &quot;some were entranced by the game&#x27;s abounding atmosphere and visual detail. Others left frozen by clumpy interaction with an unthreatening, almost rustic world ... where they&#x27;d wander the districts of Yokosuka while asking unusual questions to pensioners and hairdressers.&quot; In the same year, &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote: &quot;[&quot;Shenmue&quot;″s] pacing might be glacial compared to the rollercoaster tempo of &quot;Uncharted&quot;, but slowing things down allows for a greater appreciation of everything that Suzuki and Sega&#x27;s AM2 department achieved here ... How everything is held together remains quite exquisite, under the closest scrutiny, even by 2014 standards.&quot;

Reviews of the HD ports of &quot;Shenmue&quot; in 2018 were less positive. &quot;Destructoid&quot;″s Peter Glagowski wrote that &quot;Shenmue&quot; had &quot;interesting concepts that are marred by poor execution&quot;, and criticized the combat and slow pacing. He concluded: &quot;This open-world design was truly original and fascinating in 1999, but there really wasn&#x27;t a need to include half of the features that &quot;Shenmue&quot; has.&quot; The &quot;Escapist&quot; critic Ben &quot;Yahtzee&quot; Croshaw disliked the &quot;relentless&quot; and &quot;frenetic&quot; combat, and felt that the open world lacked content between key story moments. The critic James Stephanie Sterling wrote that &quot;&quot;Shenmue&quot; is dreadful [...] Maybe at the turn of the millennium when this game was worth a shit it could get away with being bold, but boldness is no excuse for wasting the player&#x27;s time, having absolutely no respect for the audience or its patience, and generally expecting people to make their own fun in a game that doesn&#x27;t really give all that many tools to have fun with.&quot;

&quot;Shenmue&quot; attracted a cult following. Fans visit Dobuita Street in Yokosuka, where most of the game is set. It has been included in several lists of the greatest games of all time. In 2007, &quot;Edge&quot; named it the 50th-greatest game, and in 2008 it was voted the 25th-greatest in Game&#x27;s reader poll of more than 100,000 votes. In 2006 and 2008, &quot;IGN&quot; readers voted &quot;Shenmue&quot; the 81st-greatest game. In April 2011, &quot;Empire&quot; ranked it the 42nd-best game. In April 2013, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked &quot;Shenmue&quot; and &quot;Shenmue II&quot; the joint-best Dreamcast games. In September 2013, readers of the German games magazine &quot;M! Games&quot; voted &quot;Shenmue&quot; the best game of all time. In October 2013, MSN UK named it one of the 20 best games of all time. In 2014, &quot;Shenmue&quot; was named the 71st-best game ever by &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; and the seventh by &quot;Empire&quot;.

&quot;Shenmue&quot; is credited for pioneering several game technologies. In its list of &quot;top five underappreciated innovators&quot;, &quot;1UP.com&quot; credited &quot;Shenmue&quot; as the original &quot;open-world city game&quot; before the idea was popularized by games such as &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; (2001). Its large environments, wealth of options and level of detail have been compared to later sandbox games including &quot;Grand Theft Auto,&quot; &quot;Yakuza&quot;, &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, and &quot;Deadly Premonition&quot;. &quot;Shenmue&quot; is also credited for naming and popularizing the quick time event, which games including &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, &quot;God of War&quot;, and &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; would incorporate.

==Sequels==
Suzuki plans &quot;Shenmue&quot; to cover at least four games. &quot;Shenmue II&quot;, developed simultaneously with &quot;Shenmue&quot;, was released in 2001 in Japan and Europe and 2002 in North America. It was also a commercial failure, and &quot;Shenmue III&quot; entered a period of development hell lasting over a decade. In 2004, Sega announced a massively multiplayer online role-playing game for PC set in the &quot;Shenmue&quot; world, &quot;Shenmue Online&quot;, but it was never released. In 2010, Sega announced another spin-off, &quot;Shenmue City&quot;, a social game for the Yahoo Mobage mobile service; it was shut down in late 2011.

In September 2011, Suzuki left Sega to focus on his development studio Ys Net. At the E3 conference on June 15, 2015, he announced a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign to develop &quot;Shenmue III&quot; with Ys Net for PlayStation 4 and Windows having licensed the rights from Sega. The campaign reached its initial $2 million goal in just under nine hours. On July 17, 2015, &quot;Shenmue III&quot; became the fastest-funded and highest-funded video game project in Kickstarter history, raising $6.3 million in total. It was released on November 19, 2019.

== Ports ==
Sega created ports of &quot;Shenmue&quot; for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, but these went unreleased. The programmer Makoto Wada said this was due to problems with the product placement contract, which only covered the Dreamcast version. A remake of &quot;Shenmue&quot; and &quot;Shenmue II,&quot; featuring new models, textures and lighting, was canceled in 2017 due to technical problems. 

On August 21, 2018, Sega released high-definition ports of &quot;Shenmue&quot; and &quot;Shenmue II&quot; for PlayStation 4, Windows and Xbox One. The ports were developed by the British studio D3T, and include new graphics and control options, improved user interfaces, and Japanese and English voices. Some details, such as the product placement, were omitted, and cutscenes were presented in their original aspect ratio due to technical limitations. 

The ports were released in Japan on November 22, 2018, and debuted at number four on the Japanese charts with 37,529 retail sales on PlayStation 4. They remained among the top 20 bestselling games in Japan until December 2, 2018, having sold almost 45,000 copies. &quot;IGN&quot; reported numerous bugs affecting graphics, cutscenes, controls and saved games. Eigo Kasahara, the planning director of the original &quot;Shenmue&quot;, expressed frustration and said he had urged D3T to fix the problems. In 2021, a fan project to remake &quot;Shenmue&quot; based on the 2018 ports using Unreal Engine 4 was announced.

==Other media==
Sega released a soundtrack album, &quot;Shenmue Orchestra Version&quot;, on April 1, 1999, before the game&#x27;s release. A two-disc soundtrack album, &quot;Shenmue OST Chapter 1: Yokosuka,&quot; was released on March 23, 2000. A compilation film of &quot;Shenmue&quot;″s cutscenes, &quot;Shenmue: The Movie&quot;, was released theatrically in Japan in 2001 and packaged with the Xbox version of &quot;Shenmue II&quot;. An premiered on February 6, 2022.

<text>A pH indicator is a halochromic chemical compound added in small amounts to a solution so the pH (acidity or basicity) of the solution can be determined visually or spectroscopically by changes in absorption and/or emission properties. Hence, a pH indicator is a chemical detector for hydronium ions (H3O+) or hydrogen ions (H+) in the Arrhenius model.

Normally, the indicator causes the color of the solution to change depending on the pH. Indicators can also show change in other physical properties; for example, olfactory indicators show change in their odor. The pH value of a neutral solution is 7.0 at 25°C (standard laboratory conditions). Solutions with a pH value below 7.0 are considered acidic and solutions with pH value above 7.0 are basic. Since most naturally occurring organic compounds are weak electrolytes, such as carboxylic acids and amines, pH indicators find many applications in biology and analytical chemistry. Moreover, pH indicators form one of the three main types of indicator compounds used in chemical analysis. For the quantitative analysis of metal cations, the use of complexometric indicators is preferred, whereas the third compound class, the redox indicators, are used in redox titrations (titrations involving one or more redox reactions as the basis of chemical analysis).

==Theory==
In and of themselves, pH indicators are usually weak acids or weak bases. The general reaction scheme of acidic pH indicators in aqueous solutions can be formulated as:

:HInd(aq) + (l) (aq) + (aq)

where, &quot;HInd&quot; is the acidic form and &quot;Ind−&quot; is the conjugate base of the indicator.

Vice versa for basic pH indicators in aqueous solutions:

:IndOH(aq) + (l) (l) + (aq) + (aq)

where &quot;IndOH&quot; stands for the basic form and &quot;Ind+&quot; for the conjugate acid of the indicator.

The ratio of concentration of conjugate acid/base to concentration of the acidic/basic indicator determines the pH (or pOH) of the solution and connects the color to the pH (or pOH) value. For pH indicators that are weak electrolytes, the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation can be written as:

:pH = p&quot;K&quot;a + log10 

:pOH = p&quot;K&quot;b + log10 

The equations, derived from the acidity constant and basicity constant, states that when pH equals the p&quot;K&quot;a or p&quot;K&quot;b value of the indicator, both species are present in a 1:1 ratio. If pH is above the p&quot;K&quot;a or p&quot;K&quot;b value, the concentration of the conjugate base is greater than the concentration of the acid, and the color associated with the conjugate base dominates. If pH is below the p&quot;K&quot;a or p&quot;K&quot;b value, the converse is true.

Usually, the color change is not instantaneous at the p&quot;K&quot;a or p&quot;K&quot;b value, but a pH range exists where a mixture of colors is present. This pH range varies between indicators, but as a rule of thumb, it falls between the p&quot;K&quot;a or p&quot;K&quot;b value plus or minus one. This assumes that solutions retain their color as long as at least 10% of the other species persists. For example, if the concentration of the conjugate base is 10 times greater than the concentration of the acid, their ratio is 10:1, and consequently the pH is p&quot;K&quot;a + 1 or p&quot;K&quot;b + 1. Conversely, if a 10-fold excess of the acid occurs with respect to the base, the ratio is 1:10 and the pH is p&quot;K&quot;a − 1 or p&quot;K&quot;b − 1.

For optimal accuracy, the color difference between the two species should be as clear as possible, and the narrower the pH range of the color change the better. In some indicators, such as phenolphthalein, one of the species is colorless, whereas in other indicators, such as methyl red, both species confer a color. While pH indicators work efficiently at their designated pH range, they are usually destroyed at the extreme ends of the pH scale due to undesired side reactions.

==Application==
pH indicators are frequently employed in titrations in analytical chemistry and biology to determine the extent of a chemical reaction. Because of the subjective choice (determination) of color, pH indicators are susceptible to imprecise readings. For applications requiring precise measurement of pH, a pH meter is frequently used. Sometimes, a blend of different indicators is used to achieve several smooth color changes over a wide range of pH values. These commercial indicators (e.g., universal indicator and Hydrion papers) are used when only rough knowledge of pH is necessary. For a titration, the difference between the true endpoint and the indicated endpoint is called the indicator error.

Tabulated below are several common laboratory pH indicators. Indicators usually exhibit intermediate colors at pH values inside the listed transition range. For example, phenol red exhibits an orange color between pH 6.8 and pH 8.4. The transition range may shift slightly depending on the concentration of the indicator in the solution and on the temperature at which it is used. The figure on the right shows indicators with their operation range and color changes.

===Universal Indicator===

=== Precise pH measurement ===

An indicator may be used to obtain quite precise measurements of pH by measuring absorbance quantitatively at two or more wavelengths. The principle can be illustrated by taking the indicator to be a simple acid, HA, which dissociates into H+ and A−.
:HA H+ + A−
The value of the acid dissociation constant, p&quot;K&quot;a, must be known. The molar absorbances, &quot;ε&quot;HA and &quot;ε&quot;A− of the two species HA and A− at wavelengths &quot;λx&quot; and &quot;λy&quot; must also have been determined by previous experiment. Assuming Beer&#x27;s law to be obeyed, the measured absorbances &quot;Ax&quot; and &quot;Ay&quot; at the two wavelengths are simply the sum of the absorbances due to each species.
:formula_1

These are two equations in the two concentrations [HA] and [A−]. Once solved, the pH is obtained as
:formula_2
If measurements are made at more than two wavelengths, the concentrations [HA] and [A−] can be calculated by linear least squares. In fact, a whole spectrum may be used for this purpose. The process is illustrated for the indicator bromocresol green. The observed spectrum (green) is the sum of the spectra of HA (gold) and of A− (blue), weighted for the concentration of the two species.

When a single indicator is used, this method is limited to measurements in the pH range p&quot;K&quot;a ± 1, but this range can be extended by using mixtures of two or more indicators. Because indicators have intense absorption spectra, the indicator concentration is relatively low, and the indicator itself is assumed to have a negligible effect on pH.

== Equivalence point ==
In acid-base titrations, an unfitting pH indicator may induce a color change in the indicator-containing solution before or after the actual equivalence point. As a result, different equivalence points for a solution can be concluded based on the pH indicator used. This is because the slightest color change of the indicator-containing solution suggests the equivalence point has been reached. Therefore, the most suitable pH indicator has an effective pH range, where the change in color is apparent, that encompasses the pH of the equivalence point of the solution being titrated.

== Naturally occurring pH indicators ==
Many plants or plant parts contain chemicals from the naturally colored anthocyanin family of compounds. They are red in acidic solutions and blue in basic. Anthocyanins can be extracted with water or other solvents from a multitude of colored plants and plant parts, including from leaves (red cabbage); flowers (geranium, poppy, or rose petals); berries (blueberries, blackcurrant); and stems (rhubarb). Extracting anthocyanins from household plants, especially red cabbage, to form a crude pH indicator is a popular introductory chemistry demonstration.

Litmus, used by alchemists in the Middle Ages and still readily available, is a naturally occurring pH indicator made from a mixture of lichen species, particularly &quot;Roccella tinctoria&quot;. The word &quot;litmus&quot; is literally from &#x27;colored moss&#x27; in Old Norse (see Litr). The color changes between red in acid solutions and blue in alkalis. The term &#x27;litmus test&#x27; has become a widely used metaphor for any test that purports to distinguish authoritatively between alternatives.

&quot;Hydrangea macrophylla&quot; flowers can change color depending on soil acidity. In acid soils, chemical reactions occur in the soil that make aluminium available to these plants, turning the flowers blue. In alkaline soils, these reactions cannot occur and therefore aluminium is not taken up by the plant. As a result, the flowers remain pink.

Another natural pH indicator is the spice turmeric. It turns yellow when exposed to acids and reddish brown when in presence of an alkalis.

<text>In ancient Roman culture, liberalitas was the virtue of giving freely (from &quot;liber&quot;, &quot;free&quot;), hence generosity. On coins, a political leader of the Roman Republic or an emperor of the Imperial era might be depicted as displaying largess to the Roman people, with &quot;liberalitas&quot; embodied as a goddess at his side. The goddess Liberalitas appears on coinage issued under the emperors Gordian III Trajan, Antoninus Pius and Septimius Severus, sometimes designated as &quot;Augusta&quot; or &quot;Augusti&quot; in association with Imperial cult. On one example, a Roman holds out his toga to receive coins poured by Liberalitas, as Antoninus looks on from an elevated seat.

The divine Virtues are sometimes associated with a particular activity or function performed by the emperor—in the case of Liberalitas, the &quot;congiarium&quot; or giving of gifts by the emperor directly to individuals. The enacting of the particular virtue was considered an epiphany of the goddess or &quot;miraculum&quot;: Liberalitas was thought to have manifested herself when Trajan distributed cash gifts to the populace during his formal arrival ceremony &quot;(adventus)&quot; in 99 AD. Pliny names the quality of &quot;liberalitas&quot; in his &quot;Panegyric&quot; to Trajan.

Liberalitas was theologically linked to Providentia, &quot;providence&quot;, and Annona, the embodiment of the grain supply.

<text>Libertas (Latin for &#x27;liberty&#x27; or &#x27;freedom&#x27;, ) is the Roman goddess and personification of liberty. She became a politicised figure in the late republic. She sometimes also appeared on coins from the imperial period, such as Galba&#x27;s &quot;Freedom of the People&quot; coins during his short reign after the death of Nero. She is usually portrayed with two accoutrements: the spear; and a phrygian cap, which she holds out in her right hand, rather than wears on her head.

The Greek equivalent of the goddess Libertas is Eleutheria, the personification of liberty. There are many post-classical depictions of liberty as a person which often retain some of the iconography of the Roman goddess.

== Etymology ==
The noun &quot;lībertās&quot; &#x27;freedom&#x27;, on which the name of the deity is based, is a derivation from Latin &quot;līber&quot; &#x27;free&#x27;, stemming from Proto-Italic &quot;*leuþero-&quot;, and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*h₁leudʰero-&quot; &#x27;belonging to the people&#x27;, hence &#x27;free&#x27;.

==Attributes==
Libertas was associated with the pileus, a cap commonly worn by freed slaves:

Libertas was also recognized in ancient Rome by the rod (&quot;vindicta&quot; or &quot;festuca&quot;), used ceremonially in the act of &quot;Manumissio vindicta&quot;, Latin for &#x27;freedom by the rod&#x27; (emphasis added):

== Temples ==
The Roman Republic was established simultaneously with the creation of Libertas and is associated with the overthrow of the Tarquin kings. She was worshiped by the Junii, the family of Marcus Junius Brutus.
In 238 BC, before the Second Punic War, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus built a temple to Libertas on the Aventine Hill. Census tables were stored inside the temple&#x27;s atrium. A subsequent temple was built (58–57 BC) on Palatine Hill, another of the Seven hills of Rome, by Publius Clodius Pulcher. By building and consecrating the temple on the site of the former house of then-exiled Cicero, Clodius ensured that the land was legally uninhabitable. Upon his return, Cicero successfully argued that the consecration was invalid and thus managed to reclaim the land and destroy the temple. In 46 BC, the Roman Senate voted to build and dedicate a shrine to Libertas in recognition of Julius Caesar, but no temple was built; instead, a small statue of the goddess stood in the Roman Forum.

==Post-classical==

The goddess Libertas is also depicted on the Great Seal of France, created in 1848. This is the image which later influenced French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi in the creation of his statue of &quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;.

Libertas, along with other Roman goddesses, has served as the inspiration for many modern-day personifications, including the Statue of Liberty on Liberty Island in the United States. According to the National Park Service, the Statue&#x27;s Roman robe is the main feature that invokes Libertas and the symbol of Liberty from which the statue derives its name.

In addition, money throughout history has borne the name or image of Libertas. As &quot;Liberty&quot;, Libertas was depicted on the obverse (heads side) of most coinage in the U.S. into the twentieth century and the image is still used for the American Gold Eagle gold bullion coin. The University of North Carolina records two instances of private banks in its state depicting Libertas on their banknotes; Libertas is depicted on the 5, 10 and 20 Rappen denomination coins of Switzerland.

The symbolic characters Columbia who represents the United States and Marianne, who represents France, the Statue of Liberty (&quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;) in New York Harbor, and many other characters and concepts of the modern age were created, and are seen, as embodiments of Libertas.

<text>Libitina, also Libentina or Lubentina, is an ancient Roman goddess of funerals and burial. Her name was used as a metonymy for death, and undertakers were known as &quot;libitinarii&quot;. Libitina was associated with Venus, and the name appears in some authors as an epithet of Venus.

The grove &quot;(lucus)&quot; of Libitina was located on the Esquiline Hill, as were several religious sites indicating that the area had &quot;unhealthy and ill-omened&quot; associations. A public cemetery was located outside the Esquiline Gate, in the Campus Esquilinus. A temple of Venus in the grove of Libitina celebrated its founding anniversary August 19, the day of the Vinalia Rustica. When a person died, the treasury of the temple collected a coin as a &quot;death tax&quot; supposed to have been established by Servius Tullius. During a plague in 65 AD, 30,000 deaths were recorded at the temple. Livy notes two occasions when the death toll exceeded Libitina&#x27;s capacity. A panel &quot;(collegium)&quot; of funeral directors &quot;(dissignatores)&quot; was based in the grove of Libitina.

Libitina is sometimes regarded as Etruscan in origin. The name is perhaps derived from Etruscan &quot;lupu-&quot;, &quot;to die.&quot; Varro, however, offers a Latin etymology from &quot;lubere,&quot; &quot;to be pleasing,&quot; related to &quot;libido&quot;, that attempts to explain the goddess&#x27;s connection to Venus. &quot;Venus Lubentina&quot; or &quot;Libitina&quot; may result from an identification with the Etruscan Alpanu (also as Alpan or Alpnu) who had characteristics of both a love goddess and an underworld deity. The Etruscan formula &quot;alpan turce&quot; is equivalent to &quot;libens dedit,&quot; &quot;gave freely or willingly,&quot; in Latin.

The title &quot;lucina&quot; (from the Latin &quot;lux, lucis,&quot; &quot;light&quot;) links both Juno and Diana to the light of the Moon, the cycles of which were used to track female fertility as well as measure the duration of a pregnancy. Priests of Juno called her by the epithet &quot;Juno Covella&quot; on the new moon. The title might alternately have been derived from &quot;lucus&quot; (&quot;grove&quot;) after a sacred grove of lotus trees on the Esquiline Hill associated with Juno, later the site of her temple.

Juno Lucina was chief among a number of deities who influenced or guided every aspect of birth and child development, such as Vagitanus, who opened the newborn&#x27;s mouth to cry, and Fabulinus, who enabled the child&#x27;s first articulate speech. The collective &quot;di nixi&quot; were birth goddesses, and had an altar in the Campus Martius.

The asteroid 146 Lucina and the extinct species of ostracod Luprisca incuba are named after this aspect of the goddess.

<doc id="85423" wikidata="Q2868" url="?curid=85423" title="Lima">
<text>Lima ( ; ), founded in 1535 as the Ciudad de los Reyes (, Spanish for &quot;City of Kings&quot;), is the capital and largest city of Peru. It is located in the valleys of the Chillón, Rímac and Lurín Rivers, in the desert zone of the central coastal part of the country, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The city is considered the political, cultural, financial and commercial center of Peru. Due to its geostrategic importance, the Globalization and World Cities Research Network has categorized it as a &quot;beta&quot; tier city. Jurisdictionally, the metropolis extends mainly within the province of Lima and in a smaller portion, to the west, within the Constitutional Province of Callao, where the seaport and the Jorge Chávez Airport are located. Both provinces have regional autonomy since 2002.

The 2023 census projection indicates that the city of Lima has an estimated population of 10,092,000 inhabitants, making it the most populated city in the country. Together with the seaside city of Callao, it forms a contiguous urban area known as the Lima Metropolitan Area, which encompasses a total of 10,151,200 inhabitants. When considering the constitutional province of Callao, the total agglomeration reaches a population of 11,342,100 inhabitants, one of the thirty most populated urban agglomerations in the world. The city is marked by severe urban segregation between the poor &quot;pueblos jóvenes&quot;, populated in large part by immigrants from the Andean highlands, and wealthy neighbourhoods. From 1985 onwards, barriers known as &quot;walls of shame&quot; run across much of the city separating rich areas from the poor.

Lima was named by natives in the agricultural region known by native Peruvians as &quot;Limaq&quot;. It became the capital and most important city in the Viceroyalty of Peru. Following the Peruvian War of Independence, it became the capital of the Republic of Peru (República del Perú). Around one-third of the national population now lives in its metropolitan area.

In October 2013, Lima was chosen to host the 2019 Pan American Games; these games were held at venues in and around Lima, and were the largest sporting event ever hosted by the country. It also hosted the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Meetings of 2008 and 2016, the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group in October 2015, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in December 2014, and the Miss Universe 1982 contest. In November 2024, it hosted the APEC summit for the third time.

==Etymology==
According to early Spanish articles, the Lima area was once called &quot;Itchyma&quot;, after its original inhabitants. However, even before the Inca occupation of the area in the 15th century, a famous oracle in the Rímac Valley had come to be known by visitors as &quot;Limaq&quot; (Limaq, pronounced , which means &quot;talker&quot; or &quot;speaker&quot; in the coastal Quechua that was the area&#x27;s primary language before the Spanish arrival). This oracle was eventually destroyed by the Spanish and replaced with a church, but the name persisted: the chronicles show &quot;Límac&quot; replacing &quot;Ychma&quot; as the common name for the area.

Modern scholars speculate that the word &quot;Lima&quot; originated as the Spanish pronunciation of the native name Limaq. Linguistic evidence seems to support this theory, as spoken Spanish consistently rejects stop consonants in word-final position.

The city was founded in 1535 under the name City of Kings (), because its foundation was decided on January 
6, date of the feast of the Epiphany. This name quickly fell into disuse, and &quot;Lima&quot; became the city&#x27;s name of choice; on the oldest Spanish maps of Peru, both &quot;Lima&quot; and &quot;Ciudad de los Reyes&quot; can be seen together. After José de San Martín reached Lima in 1821 during the Peruvian War of Independence, the city was granted the title of &quot;Heroica y Esforzada Ciudad de los Libres&quot; (&quot;Heroic and Corageous City of the Free&quot;) in September of the same year.

The river that feeds Lima is called &quot;Rímac&quot;, and many people erroneously assume that this is because its original Inca name is &quot;Talking River&quot; (the Incas spoke a highland variety of Quechua, in which the word for &quot;talker&quot; was pronounced ). However, the original inhabitants of the valley were not Incas. This name is an innovation arising from an effort by the Cuzco nobility in colonial times to standardize the toponym so that it would conform to the phonology of Cuzco Quechua.

Later, as the original inhabitants died out and the local Quechua became extinct, the Cuzco pronunciation prevailed. Nowadays, Spanish-speaking locals do not see the connection between the name of their city and the name of the river that runs through it. They often assume that the valley is named after the river; however, Spanish documents from the colonial period show the opposite to be true.

==Symbols==
===Flag===

The Flag of Lima is historically known as &quot;Banner of the City of the Kings of Peru&quot;. It is formed by a golden-colored silk canvas and in the center is the embroidered coat of arms of the city.

===Coat of arms===

The coat of arms of Lima was granted by the Spanish Crown on 7 December 1537, through a &quot;real cédula&quot; signed in Valladolid by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and his mother, Queen Joanna of Castile. It is formed by a main field azure, with three gold crowns of kings placed in a triangle and above them a gold star that touches the three crowns with its points, and in the orle some gold letters that say: &quot;Hoc signum vere regum est (This is the true sign of the kings).&quot; Outside the shield are the initials I and K (Ioana and Karolus), which are the names of Queen Joanna and her son Charles V. A star is placed above the letters and two crowned sabre-faced eagles embracing them, which hold the coat of arms.

===Anthem===
The anthem of Lima was heard for the first time on 18 January 2008, in a solemn session that was attended by the then President of Peru Alan García, the mayor of the city Luis Castañeda Lossio and various authorities. Those in charge of creating the anthem were the councillors Luis Enrique Tord (author of the lyrics), Euding Maeshiro (composer of the melody) and the musical producer Ricardo Núñez (arranger).

==History==
===Pre-Columbian era===
Although the history of the city of Lima began with its Spanish foundation in 1535, the territory formed by the valleys of the Rímac, Chillón and Lurín rivers was occupied by pre-Inca settlements, which were grouped under the Lordship of Ichma. The Maranga culture and the Lima culture were the ones that established and forged an identity in these territories. During those times, the sanctuaries of Lati (current Puruchuco) and Pachacámac (the main pilgrimage sanctuary during the time of the Incas) were built, it was built from 3rd century to 15th century by several civilizations, and which was used even until the time the Spanish conquistadors arrived.

These cultures were conquered by the Wari Empire during the height of its imperial expansion. It is during this time that the ceremonial center of Cajamarquilla was built. As Wari importance declined, local cultures regained autonomy, highlighting the Chancay culture. Later, in the 15th century, these territories were incorporated into the Inca Empire. From this time we can find a great variety of huacas throughout the city, some of which are under investigation.

The most important or well-known huacas are those of Huallamarca, Pucllana, and Mateo Salado, all located in the middle of Lima districts with very high urban growth, so they are surrounded by business and residential buildings; however, that does not prevent its perfect state of conservation.

During the time of the Incas, the valley of Lima was highly populated and organized into an Inca province, or huamani (wamani), called Pachacamac. The colonial Spanish historian Bernabé Cobo mentions that the huamani of Pachacamac was subdivided into three hunu of tributary men, rather than the conventional four hunu. It has also been argued that a fourth hunu may have existed but was not recorded. The primary meaning of the word hunu in Quechua is 10,000, leading to the assumption that 30,000 families lived in the valley. This assumption has been criticized, including by the historian Åke Wedin, because hunu can also mean countless, and therefore could simply refer to a very large group of men. The scholar John Rowe suggested that the valley had a population of about 150,000 during Inca times.

Whatever the case, each recorded hunu of Pachacamac had a head town, corresponding to some of the most populated settlements in the valley: Caraguayllo (Carabayllo), Maranga, and Surco (or Sulco, also known as the archaeological site Armatambo)... this valley was divided, according to the government of the Inca kings, into three &#x27;unos&#x27; or governorships of ten thousand families each; the town of Caraguayllo was the head of the first; that of Maranga, which is situated in the middle of the valley, of the second, and the third, that of Surco; this last town was the largest of all ...The inhabitants of the pre-Columbian town of Surco were relocated to the modern district of Santiago de Surco early in the colonial period. In addition to Aymara and Quechua, the inhabitants of the northern part of the valley, specifically in the hunu of Carabayllo, spoke an additional language believed to be Quingnam.

Regarding the pre-Hispanic settlement of Lima, it is recorded that this part of the valley, near the Rimac river, was administered by a curaca, or local lord, named Taulichusco. He was a former yana, or servant, of Mama Vilo, one of the wives of Emperor Huayna Capac. Lima was awarded to Taulichusco in recognition of his services to the Inca royalty. Some of Peru&#x27;s most important buildings were erected on the sites of major constructions of the pre-Hispanic settlement. For example, the residential palace of Taulichusco was located where the modern Palacio de Gobierno of Peru stands today. A temple called Puma Inti once occupied the site where the Metropolitan Cathedral of Lima is now, and the Municipal Theatre of Lima is situated where a pre-Columbian structure, referred to as Huaca El Cabildo by the Spaniards, once stood. These buildings were centered around a plaza, which was later expanded to become the Plaza Mayor. The Huaca de Aliaga and Huaca Riquelme were other major buildings near the plaza. Other nearby constructions included the temple-oracle of Rímac, one of the main places of worship in the valley, also known as the so-called &quot;huaca grande&quot; that once stood in Barrios Altos.

===Spanish founding===
In 1532, the Spanish and their indigenous allies (from the ethnic groups subdued by the Incas) under the command of Francisco Pizarro took monarch Atahualpa prisoner in the city of Cajamarca. Although a ransom was paid, he was sentenced to death for political and strategic reasons. After some battles, the Spanish conquered their empire. The Spanish Crown named Francisco Pizarro governor of the lands he had conquered. Pizarro decided to found the capital in the Rímac river valley, after a failed attempt to establish it in Jauja.

He considered that Lima was strategically located, close to a favorable coast for the construction of a port but prudently far from it in order to prevent attacks by pirates and foreign powers, on fertile lands and with a suitable cool climate. Thus, on 6 January 1535, Lima was founded with the name &quot;City of the Kings&quot;, named in this way in honor of the epiphany, on territories that had been of the kuraka Taulichusco. The explanation of this name is due to the fact that &quot;around the same time in January, the Spaniards were looking for the place to lay the foundation for the new city, [...] not far from the Pachacámac sanctuary, near the Rímac river.

However, as had happened with the region, initially called New Castile and later Peru, the City of the Kings soon lost its name in favor of &quot;Lima&quot;. Pizarro, with the collaboration of Nicolás de Ribera, Diego de Agüero and Francisco Quintero personally traced the Plaza Mayor and the rest of the city grid, building the Viceroyalty Palace (today transformed into the Government Palace of Peru, which hence retains the traditional name of &quot;Casa de Pizarro&quot;) and the Cathedral, whose first stone Pizarro laid with his own hands. In August 1536, the flourishing city was besieged by the troops of the Inca general Quizu Yupanqui under orders from the monarch Manco Inca Yupanqui who was in Cusco, but the Spanish and their indigenous allies managed to defeat them. The Huaylas (Wayllas) army&#x27;s assistance was of special importance to the Spanish. The army arrived personally led by Contarhuancho (Kuntur-Wanchu), a secondary wife of the deceased Emperor Wayna Qhapaq and now a respected kuraka of half the province of Huaylas, the Hanan Huaylas or Upper Huaylas moiety. Contarhuancho came to Lima after receiving a plea for help in a quipu message from her daughter, the Huaylas-Inca princess Doña Inés Huaylas Yupanqui.

In the following years, Lima gained prestige by being designated the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru and the seat of a &quot;Real Audiencia&quot; in 1543. Since the location of the coastal city was conditioned by the ease of communications with Spain, a close bond with the port of Callao was soon established.

===Colonial time===
For the next century, it prospered as the center of an extensive trade network that integrated the viceroyalty with the Americas, Europe, and East Asia. But the city was not without its dangers; violent earthquakes destroyed a large part of it between 1586 and 1687, leading to a great deal of construction activity. It is then when aqueducts, starlings and retaining walls appear before the flooding of the rivers, the bridge over the Rímac is finished, the cathedral is built, and numerous hospitals, convents and monasteries are built. Then we can see that the city is articulated around its neighborhoods. Another threat was the presence of pirates and corsairs in the Pacific Ocean, which motivated the construction of the Walls of Lima between 1684 and 1687.

The 1687 earthquake marked a turning point in the history of Lima, since it coincided with a recession in trade due to economic competition with other cities such as Buenos Aires. With the creation of the Viceroyalty of New Granada in 1717, the political demarcations were reorganized, and Lima only lost some territories that actually already enjoyed their autonomy. In 1746 a strong earthquake severely damaged the city and destroyed Callao, forcing a massive reconstruction effort by Viceroy José Antonio Manso de Velasco.

In the second half of the 18th century, Enlightenment ideas about public health and social control influenced the development of the city. During this period, the Peruvian capital was affected by the Bourbon reforms as it lost its monopoly on foreign trade and its control over the important mining region of Upper Peru. This economic weakening led the elite of the city to depend on the positions granted by the viceregal government and the Church, which contributed to keeping them more linked to the Crown than to the cause of independence.

The greatest political-economic impact that the city experienced at that time occurred with the creation of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata in 1776, which changed the course and orientations imposed by the new mercantile traffic. Among the buildings built during this period there is the Coliseo de Gallos, the Acho Bullring and the General Cemetery. The first two were erected to regulate these popular activities, centralizing them in one place, while the cemetery put an end to the practice of burying the dead in churches, considered unhealthy by public authorities.
===Independence===

A combined expedition of Argentine and Chilean independence fighters led by General Don José de San Martín landed in southern Lima in 1820, but did not attack the city. Faced with a naval blockade and guerrilla action on the mainland, Viceroy José de la Serna was forced to evacuate the city in July 1821 to save the Royalist army. Fearing a popular uprising and lacking the means to impose the order, the City Council invited San Martín to enter the city, signing a Declaration of Independence at his request.

Proclaimed the independence of Peru in 1821 by General San Martín, Lima became the capital of the new Republic of Peru. Thus, it was the seat of the government of the liberator and also the seat of the first Constituent Congress that the country had. The war lasted for two more years, during which the city changed hands many times and suffered abuses from both sides. By the time the war was decided, on 9 December 1824, at the Battle of Ayacucho, Lima had been considerably impoverished.

===Republican era===
After the War of Independence, Lima became the capital of the Republic of Peru, but the country&#x27;s economic stagnation and political disorder paralyzed its urban development. This situation was reversed in the 1850s, when the growing public and private income derived from the export of guano allowed a rapid expansion of the city. In the following twenty years, the State financed the construction of large public buildings to replace the old viceregal establishments, among these are the Central Market, the General Slaughterhouse, the Mental Asylum, the Penitentiary and the Hospital Dos de Mayo. There were also improvements in communications; in 1850 a railway line between Lima and Callao was completed and in 1870 an iron bridge was inaugurated over the Rímac River, baptized as Puente Balta. In 1872 the colonial City Walls were demolished by the US engineer Henry Meiggs under contract with the Peruvian government, in anticipation of further urban growth in the future. However, this period of economic expansion also widened the gap between rich and poor, producing widespread social unrest.

During the War of the Pacific (1879–1883), the Chilean army occupied Lima after defeating Peruvian troops and reserves in the battles of San Juan and Miraflores. The city suffered from the invaders, who looted museums, public libraries and educational institutions. At the same time, angry mobs attacked wealthy citizens and the Asian colony, looting their properties and businesses.

===20th century===
At the beginning of the 20th century, the construction of avenues that would serve as a matrix for the development of the city began. The avenues Paseo de la República, Leguía (today called Arequipa), Brasil and the landscaping Salaverry that headed south and Venezuela and Colonial avenues to the west joining the port of Callao.

In the 1930s the great constructions began with the remodeling of the Government Palace of Peru and the Palacio Municipal. These constructions reached their peak in the 1950s, during the government of Manuel A. Odría, when the great buildings of the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Education were built (Javier Alzamora Valdez Building, currently the seat of the Superior Court of Justice of Lima), the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Labor and the Hospitals of the Workers&#x27; Insurance and of the Employee as well as the National Stadium and several large housing units.

Also in those years a phenomenon began that changed the configuration of the city, which was the massive immigration of inhabitants from the interior of the country, producing the exponential growth of the capital&#x27;s population and the consequent urban expansion. The new populations were settling on land near the center which was used as an agricultural area. The current districts of Lince, La Victoria to the south were populated; Breña and Pueblo Libre to the west; El Agustino, Ate and San Juan de Lurigancho to the east and San Martín de Porres and Comas to the north.

As an emblematic point of this expansion, in 1973 the self-managed community of Villa El Salvador (current district of Villa El Salvador) was created, located 30 km south of the city center and currently integrated into the metropolitan area. In the 1980s, terrorist violence added to the disorderly growth of the city the increase of settlers who arrived as internally displaced persons. In the 1940s, Lima started a period of rapid growth spurred by migration from the Andean region, as rural people sought opportunities for work and education. The population, estimated at 600,000 in 1940, reached 1.9 million by 1960 and 4.8 million by 1980. At the start of this period, the urban area was confined to a triangular area bounded by the city&#x27;s historic center, Callao and Chorrillos; in the following decades settlements spread to the north, beyond the Rímac River, to the east, along the Central Highway and to the south. The new migrants, at first confined to slums in downtown Lima, led this expansion through large-scale land invasions, which evolved into shanty towns, known as &quot;pueblos jóvenes&quot;.

==Geography==
The urban area covers about . It is located on mostly flat terrain in the Peruvian coastal plain, within the valleys of the Chillón, Rímac and Lurín rivers. The city slopes gently from the shores of the Pacific Ocean into valleys and mountain slopes located as high as above sea level. Within the city are isolated hills that are not connected to the surrounding hill chains, such as El Agustino, San Cosme, El Pino, La Milla, Muleria and Pro hills. The San Cristobal hill in the Rímac District, which lies directly north of the downtown area, is the local extreme of an Andean hill outgrowth.

Metropolitan Lima covers , of which (31%) comprise the actual city and (69%) the city outskirts. The urban area extends around from north to south and around from west to east. The city center is located inland at the shore of the Rímac River, a vital resource for the city, since it carries what will become drinking water for its inhabitants and fuels the hydroelectric dams that provide electricity to the area. While no official administrative definition for the city exists, it is usually considered to be composed of the central 30 of 43 districts of Lima Province, corresponding to an urban area centered around the historic Cercado de Lima district. The city is the core of the Lima Metro Area, one of the ten largest metro areas in the Americas. Lima is the world&#x27;s third largest desert city, after Karachi, Pakistan, and Cairo, Egypt.
===Climate===

Lima has a mild climate, despite its location in the tropics and in a desert. Lima&#x27;s proximity to the waters of the Pacific Ocean leads to intense maritime moderation of the temperatures, thereby making the climate much milder than those to be expected for a tropical desert, and thus Lima can be classified as a desert climate (Köppen: &quot;BWh&quot;) with subtropical temperature ranges. Temperatures rarely fall below or rise above . Two distinct seasons can be identified: summer, December through April, and winter from June through September/October. May and October/November are generally transition months, with a more dramatic warm-to-cool weather transition in later May or/and earlier June. Situated onshore from the cold ocean waters, rainfall is extremely rare in Lima.

The summers, December through April, are sunny, hot, and muggy. Daily temperatures oscillate between lows of and highs of . Coastal fogs occur in some mornings and high clouds in some afternoons and evenings. Summer sunsets are colorful, known by locals as &quot;cielo de brujas&quot; (Spanish for &quot;sky of witches&quot;), since the sky commonly turns shades of orange, pink, and red around 7 pm.

During winter, June through October, the weather is dramatically different. Grey skies, breezy conditions, higher humidity, and cooler temperatures prevail. Long 10 to 15-day stretches of dark overcast skies are not uncommon. Persistent morning drizzle (garúa) frequently occurs from June through September, coating the streets with a thin layer of water that generally dries up by early afternoon. Winter temperatures vary little between day and night. They range from lows of and highs of , rarely exceeding except in the easternmost districts.

Relative humidity is always very high, particularly in the mornings. High humidity produces brief morning fog in the early summer and a usually persistent low cloud deck during the winter (generally develops in late May and persists until mid-November or even early December). The predominantly onshore flow makes the Lima area one of the cloudiest among the entire Peruvian coast. Lima has only 1284 hours of sunshine a year, 27.9 hours in August and 183 hours in April, which is exceptionally little for its latitude. By comparison, London has an average of 1653 hours, and Moscow 1731. Winter cloudiness prompts locals to seek sunshine in Andean valleys above above sea level.

While relative humidity is high, rainfall is very low due to strong atmospheric stability. The severely low rainfall impacts the city&#x27;s water supply, which originates from wells and from rivers that flow from the Andes. Inland districts receive anywhere between of rainfall per year, which accumulates mainly during the winter. Coastal districts receive only . As previously mentioned, winter precipitation occurs as persistent morning drizzle. These are locally called &#x27;garúa&#x27;, &#x27;llovizna&#x27; or &#x27;camanchacas&#x27;. On the other hand, summer rain is infrequent and occurs in the form of isolated light and brief showers. These generally occur during afternoons and evenings when leftovers from Andean storms arrive from the east. The lack of heavy rainfall arises from high atmospheric stability caused, in turn, by the combination of cool waters from semi-permanent coastal upwelling and the presence of the cold Humboldt Current and warm air aloft associated with the South Pacific anticyclone.

Lima&#x27;s climate (like most of coastal Peru) gets severely disrupted in El Niño events. Coastal waters usually average around , but get much warmer (as in 1998 when the water reached ). Air temperatures rise accordingly.

==Government==
===National===
Lima is the capital city of the Republic of Peru and Lima Province. As such, it is home to the three branches of the Government of Peru.

The executive branch is headquartered in the Government Palace, located in the Plaza Mayor. All ministries are located in the city.

The legislative branch is headquartered in the Legislative Palace and is home to the Congress of the Republic of Peru.

The Judicial branch is headquartered in the Palace of Justice and is home to the Supreme Court of Peru. The Palace of Justice in Lima is seat of the Supreme Court of Justice the highest judicial court in Peru with jurisdiction over the entire territory of Peru.

Lima is seat of two of the 28-second highest or Superior Courts of Justice. The first and oldest Superior Court in Lima is the &quot;Superior Court of Justice,&quot; belonging to the Judicial District and. Due to the judicial organization of Peru, the highest concentration of courts is located in Lima despite the fact that its judicial district has jurisdiction over only 35 of the 43 districts. The &quot;Superior Court of the Cono Norte&quot; is the second Superior Court located in Lima and is part of the Judicial District of North Lima. This judicial district has jurisdiction over the remaining eight districts, all located in northern Lima.

===Local===

The city is roughly equivalent to the Province of Lima, which is subdivided into 43 districts. The Metropolitan Municipality has authority over the entire city, while each district has its own local government. Unlike the rest of the country, the Metropolitan Municipality, although a provincial municipality, acts as and has functions similar to a regional government, as it does not belong to any of the 25 regions of Peru. Each of the 43 districts has their own district municipality that is in charge of its own district and coordinate with the metropolitan municipality.
===Political system===

==Demographics==
With a municipal population of 9,162,322 and 10,135,009 for the metropolitan area and a population density of , Lima ranks as the 30th most populous agglomeration in the world, , and the second biggest city in South America in terms of population within city limits, after São Paulo. Its population features a complex mix of racial and ethnic groups. Mestizos of mixed Amerindian and European (mostly Spanish and Italians) ancestry are the largest ethnic group, making up 69.9% of the population in 2018. Quechua are the second largest ethnic group, making up 16.8% of the population. European Peruvians are the third largest group, making up 7.4% of the population. Many are of Spanish, Italian or German descent; many others are of French, British, or Croatian descent. The minorities in Lima include the Afro-Peruvians, who make up 2.9% of the population, whose African ancestors were initially brought to the region as slaves, and the Aymara, who make up 0.7% of the population. Communities of Jews of European descent and Middle Easterners are also found in Lima. 2.3% of Lima&#x27;s population identify with other ethnic groups, including Asians. Lima&#x27;s Asian community is made up primarily of Chinese (Cantonese) and Japanese descendants, whose ancestors came mostly in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The city has, by far, the largest Chinese diaspora in Latin America.
The first settlement in what would become Lima was made up of 117 housing blocks. In 1562, another district was built across the Rímac River and in 1610, the first stone bridge was built. Lima then had a population of around 26,000; blacks made up around 40% and whites made up around 38%. By 1748, the white population totaled 16,000–18,000. In 1861, the number of inhabitants surpassed 100,000 and by 1927, had doubled.

During the early 20th century, thousands of immigrants came to the city, including people of European descent. They organized social clubs and built their own schools. Examples are The American-Peruvian school, the Alianza Francesa de Lima, the Lycée Franco-Péruvien and the hospital Maison de Sante; Markham College, the British-Peruvian school in Monterrico, Antonio Raymondi District Italian School, the Pestalozzi Swiss School and also, several German-Peruvian schools.

Chinese and a lesser number of Japanese came to Lima and established themselves in the Barrios Altos neighborhood in downtown Lima. Lima residents refer to their Chinatown as &quot;Barrio chino&quot; or &quot;Calle Capon&quot; and the city&#x27;s ubiquitous Chifa restaurantssmall, sit-down, usually Chinese-run restaurants serving the Peruvian spin on Chinese cuisinecan be found by the dozens in this enclave.

In 2014, the National Institute for Statistics and Information (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica e Informatica) reported that the population in Lima&#x27;s 49 districts was 9,752,000 people, including the Constitutional Province of Callao. The city and (metropolitan area) represents around 29% of the national population. Of the city&#x27;s population 48.7% are men and 51.3% are women. The 49 districts in Metropolitan Lima are divided into 5 areas: Cono Norte (North Lima), Lima Este (East Lima), Constitutional Province of Callao, Lima Centro (Central Lima) and Lima Sur (South Lima). The largest areas are Lima Norte with 2,475,432 people and Lima Este with 2,619,814 people, including the largest single district San Juan de Lurigancho, which hosts 1 million people.

Lima is considered a &quot;young&quot; city. According to INEI, by mid 2014 the age distribution in Lima was: 24.3% between 0 and 14, 27.2% between 15 and 29, 22.5% between 30 and 44, 15.4% between 45 and 59 and 10.6% above 60.

Migration to Lima from the rest of Peru is substantial. In 2013, 3,480,000 people reported arriving from other regions. This represents almost 36% of the entire population of Metropolitan Lima. The three regions that supply most of the migrants are Junin, Ancash and Ayacucho. By contrast only 390,000 emigrated from Lima to other regions.

The annual population growth rate is 1.57%. Some of the 43 metropolitan districts are considerably more populous than others. For example, San Juan de Lurigancho, San Martin de Porres, Ate, Comas, Villa El Salvador and Villa Maria del Triunfo host more than 400,000, while San Luis, San Isidro, Magdalena del Mar, Lince and Barranco have less than 60,000 residents.

A 2005 household survey study shows a socio-economic distribution for households in Lima. It used a monthly family income of 6,000 soles (around US$1,840) or more for socioeconomic level A; between 2,000 soles (US$612) and 6,000 soles (US$1,840) for level B; from 840 soles (US$257) to 2,000 soles (US$612) for level C; from 420 soles (US$128) to 1200 soles (US$368) for level D; and up to 840 soles (US$257) for level E. In Lima, 18% were in level E; 32.3% in level D; 31.7% in level C; 14.6% in level B; and 3.4% in level A. In this sense, 82% of the population lives in households that earn less than 2000 soles (or US$612) monthly. Other salient differences between socioeconomic levels include levels of higher education, car ownership and home size.

In Metropolitan Lima in 2013, the percentage of the population living in households in poverty was 12.8%. The level of poverty is measured by households that are unable to access a basic food and other household goods and services, such as clothing, housing, education, transportation and health. The level of poverty has decreased from 2011 (15.6%) and 2012 (14.5%). Lima Sur is the area in Lima with the highest proportion of poverty (17.7%), followed by Lima Este (14.5%), Lima Norte (14.1%) and Lima Centro (6.2%). In addition 0.2% of the population lives in extreme poverty, meaning that they are unable to access a basic food basket.

The metropolitan area, with around 7,000 factories, is the main location of industry. Products include textiles, clothing and food. Chemicals, fish, leather and oil derivatives are manufactured and processed. The financial district is in San Isidro, while much of the industrial activity takes place in the west of the city, extending to the airport in Callao. Lima has the largest export industry in South America and is a regional center for the cargo industry. Industrialization began in the 1930s and by 1950, through import substitution policies, manufacturing made up 14% of GNP. In the late 1950s, up to 70% of consumer goods were manufactured in factories located in Lima.
The Callao seaport is one of the main fishing and commerce ports in South America, covering over and shipping 20.7 million metric tons of cargo in 2007. The main export goods are commodities: oil, steel, silver, zinc, cotton, sugar and coffee.

=== Tourism ===

As the main entry point to the country, Lima has developed an important tourism industry, among which its Historic Center, its archaeological centers, its nightlife, museums, art galleries, festivities and popular traditions stand out. According to Mastercard&#x27;s Global Destination Cities Index, in 2014, Lima was the most visited city of Latin America and was the 20th city globally, with 5.11 million visitors. In 2019, Lima is the top destination in South America, with 2.63 million international visitors in 2018 and a growth forecast of 10.00% percent for 2019.
The Historic Centre of Lima, which includes part of the districts of Lima and Rímac, was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988 due to the importance that the city had during the Viceroyalty of Peru, leaving as testimony a large number of architectural legacies. Highlights include the Basilica and Convent of San Francisco, the Plaza Mayor, the Cathedral, the Basilica and Convent of Santo Domingo, the Palacio de Torre Tagle, among others. The tour of the churches of the city is very popular among tourists. In a short walk through the city center we can find many, several of which date from the 16th and 17th centuries.
Among them, the Metropolitan Cathedral and the Basilica of San Francisco stand out, which are said to be linked by the underground passageways of their catacombs. The Sanctuary and Monastery of Las Nazarenas also stands out, a place of pilgrimage to the &quot;Señor de los Milagros&quot; (Lord of the Miracles), whose festivities in the month of October constitute the most important religious manifestation of Lima and of all Peruvians. Some sections of the Colonial Walls of Lima can still be seen: such is the case of the Bastion Santa Lucía, remains of the old Spanish fortification built by Viceroy Melchor de Navarra y Rocafull around the city center, whose location adjoins the limit of Barrios Altos and El Agustino.

Likewise, having Lima the privilege of being the only capital in South America with immediate access to the sea, it has wide tourist piers that in recent years have become a great attraction for thousands of tourists, especially in the districts of Miraflores and Barranco, where there is also a wide development in terms of entertainment in these areas, turning the capital into a place with several places of tourism and entertainment.

Until the 1970s, the hotel offer was characterized by having the best hotels in the city in the center of Lima, however, since the early 1990s to date, these establishments have positioned themselves in other areas such as the central-southern area of the capital as in Miraflores, Barranco, Santiago de Surco, Surquillo and San Borja; in addition to the San Isidro district that has the largest hotel building in Peru, the 30-story Westin Libertador.

These fine examples of medieval Spanish fortifications were used to defend the city from attacks by pirates and corsairs. For this, part of the Walls corresponding to the rear area of the Basilica of San Francisco, very close to the Government Palace, was recovered, in which a park was built (called Parque de la Muralla) and in which you can see remains of it. Half an hour from the historic center, in the district of Miraflores you can visit the tourist and entertainment center Larcomar which is located on the cliffs facing the sea.

The city has two traditional zoological parks: the main and oldest is the Parque de las Leyendas, located in the San Miguel district, and the other is the Parque Zoológico Huachipa located east of the city in the Lurigancho-Chosica district. On the other hand, the offer of cinemas is wide and has numerous state-of-the-art rooms (4D) that program international film premieres.

Exclusive beaches are visited during the summer months, which are located on the Pan-American Highway, to the north are the resorts of Santa Rosa and Ancón; Until the 1980s, the latter was the most exclusive in Lima and Peru. Currently, although it maintains its architectural beauty, it is visited by people from all over Lima North and the Center. And to the south of the city, the resorts of Punta Hermosa, Punta Negra, San Bartolo and Pucusana. Numerous restaurants, nightclubs, lounges, bars, clubs and hotels have been opened in such places to cater to bathers.

The suburban district of Cieneguilla, the district of Pachacámac and the district of Chosica provide important tourist attractions among locals. Due to its elevation (over 500 masl), the sun shines in Chosica during the winter, being very visited by the residents of Lima to escape the urban fog.

==Society and culture==
Strongly influenced by European, Andean, African and Asian culture, Lima is a melting pot, due to colonization, immigration and indigenous influences. The Historic Centre was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988.

The city is known as the &quot;Gastronomical Capital of the Americas,&quot; mixing Spanish, Andean and Asian culinary traditions.

Lima&#x27;s beaches, located along the northern and southern ends of the city, are heavily visited during the summer. Restaurants, clubs and hotels serve the beachgoers. Lima has a vibrant and active theater scene, including classic theater, cultural presentations, modern theater, experimental theater, dramas, dance performances and theater for children. Lima is home to the Municipal Theater, Segura Theater, Japanese-Peruvian Theater, Marsano Theater, British theater, Theater of the PUCP Cultural Center and the Yuyachkani Theater.

===Architecture===

The architecture of the capital is characterized by a mixture of styles as reflected in the changes between trends throughout various periods of the city&#x27;s history. Examples of colonial architecture include structures such as the Basilica and Convent of San Francisco, the Metropolitan Cathedral, and the Palacio de Torre Tagle. These constructions were generally influenced by the styles of Spanish Neoclassicism, Spanish Baroque, and the Spanish Colonial styles.

In the buildings of the historic center you can see over 1,600 balconies dating from the Viceroyalty and Republican times. The types of balconies that the city presents are open balconies, flat, box, continuous, among others. After the Independence of Peru, a gradual shift towards Neoclassical and Art Nouveau styles took place. Many of these constructions were influenced by the French architectural style.
In 1940, the census results reflected the city&#x27;s major urban problems such as sanitation, housing, work, recreation and transportation. During the following years, the Society of Architects, the Institute of Urbanism, the Grupo Espacio, the magazine &quot;El Arquitecto Peruano&quot; and the Department of Architecture at the National School of Engineers were created. These entities tried to promote the improvement of urban conditions based on modern principles. Meanwhile, the State promoted the development of collective housing through organizations such as the National Housing Commission (CNV) and the National Office of Planning and Urban Development (ONPU). With the architect Fernando Belaunde as deputy, in 1945 the Housing Plan based on Neighborhood Units was made official.

Some government buildings as well as major cultural institutions were built in this architectural time period. During the 1950s and 1960s, several Brutalist style buildings were built on behalf of the military government of Juan Velasco Alvarado. Examples of this architecture are the Museo de la Nación and the Peruvian Ministry of Defense. The 20th century saw the appearance of glass skyscrapers, particularly around the city&#x27;s financial district. There are also several new architectural projects and real estate.

===Language===
Known as Peruvian Coast Spanish, Lima&#x27;s Spanish is characterized by the lack of strong intonations as found in many other Spanish-speaking regions. It is heavily influenced by Castilian Spanish. Throughout the Viceroyalty era, most of the Spanish nobility based in Lima were originally from Castile. Limean Castillian is also characterized by the lack of &quot;voseo&quot;, unlike many other Hispanic American countries. This is because &quot;voseo&quot; was primarily used by Spain&#x27;s lower socioeconomic classes, a social group that did not begin to appear in Lima until the late colonial era.

Limean Spanish is distinguished by its clarity in comparison to other Latin American accents and has been influenced by immigrant groups including Italians, Andalusians, West Africans, Chinese and Japanese. It also has been influenced by anglicisms as a result of globalization, as well as by Andean Spanish and Quechua, due to migration from the Andean highlands.

===Museums===

Lima is home to the country&#x27;s highest concentration of museums, most notably the Museo Nacional de Arqueología, Antropología e Historia del Perú, Museum of Art, the Museo Pedro de Osma, the Museum of Natural History, the Museum of the Nation, The Sala Museo Oro del Perú Larcomar, the Museum of Italian Art, the Museum of Gold and the Larco Museum.

=== Food ===

Lima is known as the &quot;Gastronomical Capital of the Americas&quot;. A center of immigration and the center of the Spanish Viceroyalty, chefs incorporated dishes brought by the conquistadors and waves of immigrants: African, European, Chinese and Japanese. Since the second half of the 20th century, international immigrants were joined by internal migrants from rural areas. Lima cuisines include Creole food, Chifas, Cebicherias and Pollerias. The city is home to Central Restaurante, which holds the title as Best restaurant in the world, be voted for the title in 2023.

In the 21st century, its restaurants became recognized internationally.

In 2007, the Peruvian Society for Gastronomy was born with the objective of uniting Peruvian gastronomy to put together activities that would promote Peruvian food and reinforce the Peruvian national identity. The society, called APEGA, gathered chefs, nutritionists, institutes for gastronomical training, restaurant owners, chefs and cooks, researchers and journalists. They worked with universities, food producers, artisanal fishermen and sellers in food markets. One of their first projects (2008) was to create the largest food festival in Latin America, called Mistura (&quot;mixture&quot; in Portuguese). The fair takes place in September every year. The number of attendees has grown from 30,000 to 600,000 in 2014.

ceviche, crab and lobster ceviche. In the Andes one can also find trout ceviche and chicken ceviche.

About 1.7 million residents are not connected to the drinking water system and are forced to buy water from tankers, even though it is not always safe to drink. The problem of access to water continues to worsen due to drought, pollution, poor infrastructure, overexploitation by large companies and intensive agriculture.

===Religion===

The arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in Peru meant the introduction of the Catholic religion in this area populated by aborigines of various ethnic groups, who followed animist and polytheistic religions, which produced a religious syncretism. Through a long process of indoctrination and practices among the pre-Columbian settlers, the Spanish friars made faith their most important task. The city of Lima, capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru, became in the 17th century a city of monastic life where saints such as Rose of Lima (patron saint of Catholics in Lima, of National Police of Peru, of the Republic of Peru, of the American continent and of the Philippines) and Martín de Porres.

The Peruvian capital is the seat of the Archdiocese of Lima, which was established in 1541 as a diocese and in 1547 as an archdiocese. It is one of the oldest Ecclesiastical Provinces in the Americas. Currently the Archdiocese of Lima is in charge of Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani. The city also has two mosques of the Muslim religion, three synagogues of the Jewish religion, a temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints located in La Molina, a church of the Eastern Orthodox religion located in the district of Pueblo Libre, five Buddhist temples and six prayer rooms of the Church of God Ministry of Jesus Christ International

One of the most prominent Catholic religious manifestations in the capital is the procession of the Señor de Los Milagros (Lord of Miracles), whose image dating from the colonial era goes out in procession through the streets of the city in the month of October of each year. The &quot;Señor de Los Milagros&quot; was named Patron of the city by the Cabildo of Lima in 1715 and Patron of Peru in 2010.

Lima possesses five other airports: the Las Palmas Air Force Base, Collique Airport and runways in Santa María del Mar, San Bartolo and Chilca.

Jorge Chávez International Airport is currently undergoing an expansion, with a new terminal being constructed along with an additional runway and multiple commercial areas. These new expansions will consist of the Lima Airport City. The airport will be the first airport city of Latin America and will increase the current airport capacity of 30 million to 40 million passengers. The expansion project will be complete on 30 March 2025.

===Road===
Lima is a major stop on the Pan-American Highway. Because of its location on the country&#x27;s central coast, Lima is an important junction in Peru&#x27;s highway system. Three major highways originate in Lima.
*The Northern Panamerican Highway extends more than to the border with Ecuador connecting the northern districts with many major cities along the northern Peruvian coast.
*The Central Highway () connects the eastern districts with cities in central Peru. The highway extends with its terminus at Pucallpa near Brazil.
*The Southern Panamerican Highway connects the southern districts to the southern coast. The highway extends to the border with Chile.

The city has a single major bus terminal next to the mall Plaza Norte. This bus station connects to national and international destinations. Other bus stations serve private bus companies around the city. In addition, informal bus stations are located in the south, center and north of the city.

===Maritime===

Lima&#x27;s proximity to the port of Callao allows Callao to act as the metropolitan area&#x27;s major port and one of Latin America&#x27;s largest. Callao hosts nearly all maritime transport for the metropolitan area. A small port in Lurín serves oil tankers due to a nearby refinery. Maritime transport inside Lima city limits is relatively insignificant compared to that of Callao.

The Port of Chancay is currently the largest in South America with it commencing operations on 14 November 2024.

===Rail===

Lima is connected to the Central Andean region by the Ferrocarril Central Andino which runs from Lima through the departments of Junín, Huancavelica, Pasco and Huánuco. Major cities along this line include Huancayo, La Oroya, Huancavelica and Cerro de Pasco. Another inactive line runs from Lima northwards to the city of Huacho. Commuter rail services for Lima are planned as part of the larger Tren de la Costa project. Lima&#x27;s main railway station is the Desamparados station.

===Public===

Lima&#x27;s road network is based mostly on large divided avenues rather than freeways. Lima operates a network of nine freeways – the Via Expresa Paseo de la Republica, Via Expresa Javier Prado, Via Expresa Grau, Panamericana Norte, Panamericana Sur, Carretera Central, Via Expresa Callao, Autopista Chillon Trapiche and the Autopista Ramiro Priale.

According to a 2012 survey, the majority of the population uses public or collective transportation (75.6%), while 12.3% uses a car, taxi or motorcycle.

The urban transport system is composed of over 300 transit routes that are served by buses, microbuses and combis.

Taxis are mostly informal and unmetered; they are cheap but feature poor driving habits. Fares are agreed upon before the passenger enters the taxi. Taxis vary in size from small four-door compacts to large vans. They account for a large part of the car stock. In many cases they are just a private car with a taxi sticker on the windshield. Additionally, several companies provide on-call taxi service.

=== Corredores Complementarios Bus System ===
The Integrated Transport System (SIT), is a bus system developed by the local government to reorganize the current system of routes that has become chaotic. One of the main goals of the SIT is to reduce the number of urban routes, renew the bus fleet currently operating by many private companies and to reduce (and eventually replace) most &quot;combis&quot; from the city.

As of July 2020, SIT currently operates 16 routes: San Martin de Porres – Surco (107) Ate – San Miguel (201, 202,204,206 and 209), Rimac – Surco (301,302,303 and 306), San Juan de Lurigancho – Magdalena (404,405,409,412), and Downtown Lima – San Miguel(508)

===Colectivos===
Colectivos render express service on some major roads. The colectivos signal their specific destination with a sign on their windshield. Their routes are not generally publicitized but are understood by frequent users. The cost is generally higher than public transport; however, they cover greater distances at greater speeds due to the lack of stops. This service is informal and is illegal. Some people in the periphery use so-called &quot;mototaxis&quot; for short distances.

====Metropolitan Transport System====

The Metropolitan Transport System or El Metropolitano is a new, integrated system, consisting of a network of buses that run in exclusive corridors under the Bus Rapid Transit system (BRT). The goal is to reduce passengers&#x27; commute times, protect the environment, provide improved security and overall quality of service. Metropolitano was executed with funds from the City of Lima and financing from the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank. Metropolitana is the first BRT system to operate with natural gas, seeking to reduce air pollution. This system links the principal points of the Lima Metropolitan Area. The first phase of this project has of line (north) to Chorrillos (south). It began commercial operations on 28 July 2010. Since 2014, Lima Council operates the &quot;Sistema Integrado de Transporte Urbano&quot; (Urban integrated transport system), which comprises buses over Avenida Arequipa. By the end of 2012, the Metropolitano system counted 244 buses in its central routes and 179 buses in its feeding routes. Weekday use averages 437,148 passengers. Usage increased since 2011 by 28.2% for weekdays, 29.1% for Saturdays and 33.3% for Sundays.
====Metro====
The Lima Metro is expected to have six lines. As of 2024, there are two lines running and a third under construction. The other lines are in the ministry of transportation investments portfolio for the next 5 years.

Line 1 has twenty six passenger stations, with an average separation of . It begins in the Industrial Park of Villa El Salvador, south of the city, continuing on to Av. Pachacútec in Villa María del Triunfo and then to Av. Los Héroes in San Juan de Miraflores. Afterwards, it continues through Av. Tomás Marsano in Surco to reach Ov. Los Cabitos, to Av. Aviación and then cross the river Rimac to finish, after almost , in the east of the capital in San Juan de Lurigancho. The system operates 24 trains, each with six wagons. Each wagon has the capacity to transport 233 people. The metro system began operating in December 2012 and transported 78,224 people on average on a daily basis.

Line 2 of the metro has a first stage already working, the expansion of the line it&#x27;s being delivered in 2026, along with a portion of line 4 that will be connecting the airport to the metro system. Line 3 and expansion of line 4 are now in the pre bid stage to be done in 2025.

===Other transportation issues===

Lima has high traffic congestion, especially at peak hours. 1.397 million vehicles were in use by the end of 2012. The region operates 65.3% of the cars in the country.

The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) offered economic incentives for municipalities to implement bicycle routes in their districts. Recreational bike lanes can be found in 39 districts. The Proyecto Especial Metropolitano de Transporte No Motorizado (PEMTNM) estimates that more than a million and a half people used the bike lanes in 2012. The bike lanes ran for . They estimate that the use of the bike lanes prevented the emission of 526 tons of carbon dioxide in 2012.

San Borja district was the first to implement a bike-share program called San Borja en Bici. It supplied 200 bicycles and six stations across the district (two of them connecting with the Metro). By December 2012, the program had 2,776 subscribers.

==Challenges==
===Environment===
====Air====
Lima suffers the most from air pollution. The microscopic sediment contained within engine exhaust and industrial emissions floats in the air for extended periods of time, either continuing as air pollution or eventually coming to settle as dust upon different urban surfaces. The fine particles are the most dangerous, as if inhaled, are able to damage the human respiratory system. The recommended limit of these particles by the World Health Organization is 5 tons/km2/month. In February 2014, Lima recorded an average of 15.2 tons/km2. The two districts with the highest concentration of sedimentary dust are El Agustino (46.1 tons/km2) and Independencia (25.5 tons/km2) in February 2014.

Lima has built billboards which serve as air purifiers.
====Water====
The permissible limit of lead in the water supply is 0.05 milligrams per liter, according to the Norm ITINTEC. In January 2014, the concentration of minerals in water treatment facilities of SEDAPAL was 0.051 iron, 0.005 lead, 0.0012 cadmium and 0.0810 aluminum. These values increased 15.9% and 33.3% in iron and cadmium with respect to January 2013 and a decrease of 16.7% and 12.4% in lead and aluminum. The values are within the recommended limits.

====Solid waste====
The amount of solid waste produced per capita in Lima is about per day. In 2012, each resident produced of solid waste. The district municipalities only collect about 67% of the solid waste they generate. The rest ends up in informal landfills, rivers, or the ocean. Three municipalities recycle 20% or more of their waste.

COVID-19

Lima has a population of about 10 million people. This equates to one-third of the overall population of the nation. Lima was subjected to a lengthy period of confinement or quarantine that lasted more than four months. However, in May 2020, the process of restoring activities began as part of the national government&#x27;s economic reactivation strategy.

Lima&#x27;s green recovery is centred on bringing services closer to the most vulnerable people, with the goal of creating a green, wealthy, and equitable city for all. The municipality has an aim of implementing sustainable infrastructure to limit the development of COVID-19 through the execution of 46 km of rising bike routes.

Lima is one of over 10,000 cities from all around the world that make up the Global Covenant of Mayors.

===Access to basic services===
In Lima, 93% of households have access to water supply in their homes. In addition, 92% of homes connect with sewage systems. 99.6% of homes have grid electric service. Although most households have water and sewage systems, some are available for only a few hours a day.

One and a half million inhabitants have no access to drinking water. The water problem mainly affects the outlying areas of the capital. The story of water in Lima is one of inequality. In the most affluent districts, per capita water consumption stands at 350 liters per day. In the poorest neighborhoods, it&#x27;s between 20 and 70 liters a day.

===Security===

The perception of security varies by district. For example, San Isidro has the lowest perception of insecurity (21.4%), while Rimac has the highest perception of insecurity (85%), according to a 2012 survey. The five districts with the lowest perception of insecurity are San Isidro, San Borja, Miraflores, La Molina and Jesus Maria. The districts with the highest perception of insecurity are Rimac, San Juan de Miraflores, La Victoria, Comas and Ate.

Overall, 40% of the population in Lima above 15 years old has been a crime victim. The younger population (ages 15 to 29 years old) has the highest victimization rate (47.9%). In 2012, citizens reported thefts (47.9%): in homes or establishments (19.4%), robbery or attack (14.9%), gang aggression (5.7%), among others in lesser frequency. The districts with the highest level of victimization are Rimac, El Agustino, Villa El Salvador, San Juan de Lurigancho and Los Olivos. The safest districts by level of victimization are Lurin, Lurigancho-Chosica, San Borja, Magdalena and Surquillo. These districts do not necessarily correspond to the districts with highest or lowest perception of insecurity.

While the police force is nationally controlled and funded, each district in Lima has a community policing structure called Serenazgo. The quantity of Serenazgos officials and resources varies by district. For example, Villa Maria del Triunfo has 5,785 citizens per official. Twenty-two districts in Lima have a ratio above 1000 citizens per Serenazgo official, while 14 districts have ratios below 200 citizens per official, including Miraflores with 119 and San Isidro with 57.

The satisfaction with the Serenazgos also varies greatly by district. The highest satisfaction rates can be found in San Isidro (88.3%), Miraflores (81.6%), San Borja (77%) and Surco (75%). The lowest satisfaction rates can be found in Villa Maria del Triunfo (11%), San Juan de Miraflores (14.8%), Rimac (16.3%) and La Victoria (20%).

====Wall of Shame====
The mid-20th century saw the rural population (between 600,000 and 1 million people) taking refuge in Lima, especially during the Peruvian conflict. The new arrivals, often very poor, erected hastily built shacks. Some residents of these shantytown neighborhoods have acquired property titles, but urban planning remains largely non-existent. In response, a number of wealthy neighbourhoods built their own security barriers starting in 1985, citing security concerns. By 2019, some segments were up to 3 metres high and included barbed wire, having a total length of .

Critics have used the term wall of shame () to refer to the barriers, which are the subject of tension, especially as many inhabitants of the poorer area cross the wall everyday to work in the neighbouring affluent areas, usually as gardeners or domestic workers. The wall was partially demolished in 2023 in a number of places.

<text>IA-64 (Intel Itanium architecture) is the instruction set architecture (ISA) of the discontinued Itanium family of 64-bit Intel microprocessors. The basic ISA specification originated at Hewlett-Packard (HP), and was subsequently implemented by Intel in collaboration with HP. The first Itanium processor, codenamed &quot;Merced&quot;, was released in 2001.

The Itanium architecture is based on explicit instruction-level parallelism, in which the compiler decides which instructions to execute in parallel. This contrasts with superscalar architectures, which depend on the processor to manage instruction dependencies at runtime. In all Itanium models, up to and including &quot;Tukwila&quot;, cores execute up to six instructions per cycle.

In 2008, Itanium was the fourth-most deployed microprocessor architecture for enterprise-class systems, behind x86-64, Power ISA, and SPARC.

In 2019, Intel announced the discontinuation of the last of the CPUs supporting the IA-64 architecture.

== History ==
=== Development ===

In 1989, HP began to become concerned that reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architectures were approaching a processing limit at one instruction per cycle. Both Intel and HP researchers had been exploring computer architecture options for future designs and separately began investigating a new concept known as very long instruction word (VLIW) which came out of research by Yale University in the early 1980s.

VLIW is a computer architecture concept (like RISC and CISC) where a single instruction word contains multiple instructions encoded in one very long instruction word to facilitate the processor executing multiple instructions in each clock cycle. Typical VLIW implementations rely heavily on sophisticated compilers to determine at compile time which instructions can be executed at the same time and the proper scheduling of these instructions for execution and also to help predict the direction of branch operations. The value of this approach is to do more useful work in fewer clock cycles and to simplify processor instruction scheduling and branch prediction hardware requirements, with a penalty in increased processor complexity, cost, and energy consumption in exchange for faster execution.

=== Production ===

During this time, HP had begun to believe that it was no longer cost-effective for individual enterprise systems companies such as itself to develop proprietary microprocessors. Intel had also been researching several architectural options for going beyond the x86 ISA to address high-end enterprise server and high-performance computing (HPC) requirements.

Intel and HP partnered in 1994 to develop the IA-64 ISA, using a variation of VLIW design concepts which Intel named explicitly parallel instruction computing (EPIC). Intel&#x27;s goal was to leverage the expertise HP had developed in their early VLIW work along with their own to develop a volume product line targeted at the aforementioned high-end systems that could be sold to all original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), while HP wished to be able to purchase off-the-shelf processors built using Intel&#x27;s volume manufacturing and contemporary process technology that were better than their PA-RISC processors.

Intel took the lead on the design and commercialization process, while HP contributed to the ISA definition, the Merced/Itanium microarchitecture, and Itanium 2. The original goal year for delivering the first Itanium family product, Merced, was 1998.

=== Marketing ===

Intel&#x27;s product marketing and industry engagement efforts were substantial and achieved design wins with the majority of enterprise server OEMs, including those based on RISC processors at the time. Industry analysts predicted that IA-64 would dominate in servers, workstations, and high-end desktops, and eventually supplant both RISC and CISC architectures for all general-purpose applications. Compaq and Silicon Graphics decided to abandon further development of the Alpha and MIPS architectures respectively in favor of migrating to IA-64.

By 1997, it was apparent that the IA-64 architecture and the compiler were much more difficult to implement than originally thought, and the delivery of Itanium began slipping. Since Itanium was the first ever EPIC processor, the development effort encountered more unanticipated problems than the team was accustomed to. In addition, the EPIC concept depended on compiler capabilities that had never been implemented before, so more research was needed.

Several groups developed operating systems for the architecture, including Microsoft Windows, Unix and Unix-like systems such as Linux, HP-UX, FreeBSD, Solaris, Tru64 UNIX, and Monterey/64 (the last three were canceled before reaching the market). In 1999, Intel led the formation of an open-source industry consortium to port Linux to IA-64 they named &quot;Trillium&quot; (and later renamed &quot;Trillian&quot; due to a trademark issue), which was led by Intel and included Caldera Systems, CERN, Cygnus Solutions, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Red Hat, SGI, SuSE, TurboLinux and VA Linux Systems. As a result, a working IA-64 Linux was delivered ahead of schedule and was the first OS to run on the new Itanium processors.

Intel announced the official name of the processor, &quot;Itanium&quot;, on October 4, 1999. Within hours, the name &quot;Itanic&quot; had been coined on a Usenet newsgroup as a pun on the name &quot;Titanic&quot;, the &quot;unsinkable&quot; ocean liner that sank on its maiden voyage in 1912.

The very next day on 5th October 1999, AMD announced their plans to extend Intel&#x27;s x86 instruction set to include a fully downward compatible 64-bit mode, additionally revealing AMD&#x27;s newly coming x86 64-bit architecture, which the company had already worked on, to be incorporated into AMD&#x27;s upcoming eighth-generation microprocessor, code-named &quot;SledgeHammer&quot;. AMD also signaled a full disclosure of the architecture&#x27;s specifications and further details to be available in August 2000.

As AMD was never invited to be a contributing party for the IA-64 architecture and any kind of licensing seemed unlikely, AMD&#x27;s AMD64 architecture-extension was positioned from the beginning as an evolutionary way to add 64-bit computing capabilities to the existing x86 architecture, while still supporting legacy 32-bit x86 code, as opposed to Intel&#x27;s approach of creating an entirely new, completely x86-incompatible 64-bit architecture with IA-64.

=== End of life ===

In January 2019, Intel announced that Kittson would be discontinued, with a last order date of January 2020, and a last ship date of July 2021. In November 2023, IA-64 support was removed from the Linux kernel and is since then maintained .

== Architecture ==

Intel has extensively documented the Itanium instruction set and the technical press has provided overviews.

The architecture has been renamed several times during its history. HP originally called it &quot;PA-WideWord&quot;. Intel later called it &quot;IA-64&quot;, then &quot;Itanium Processor Architecture&quot; (IPA), before settling on &quot;Intel Itanium Architecture&quot;, but it is still widely referred to as &quot;IA-64&quot;.

It is a 64-bit register-rich explicitly parallel architecture. The base data word is 64 bits, byte-addressable. The logical address space is 264 bytes. The architecture implements predication, speculation, and branch prediction. It uses variable-sized register windowing for parameter passing. The same mechanism is also used to permit parallel execution of loops. Speculation, prediction, predication, and renaming are under control of the compiler: each instruction word includes extra bits for this. This approach is the distinguishing characteristic of the architecture.

The architecture implements a large number of registers:
* 128 general integer registers, which are 64-bit plus one trap bit (&quot;NaT&quot;, which stands for &quot;not a thing&quot;) used for speculative execution. 32 of these are static, the other 96 are stacked using variably-sized register windows, or rotating for pipelined loops. codice_1 always reads 0.
* 128 floating-point registers. The floating-point registers are 82 bits long to preserve precision for intermediate results. Instead of a dedicated &quot;NaT&quot; trap bit like the integer registers, floating-point registers have a trap value called &quot;NaTVal&quot; (&quot;Not a Thing Value&quot;), similar to (but distinct from) NaN. These also have 32 static registers and 96 windowed or rotating registers. codice_2 always reads +0.0, and codice_3 always reads +1.0.
* 64 one-bit predicate registers. These have 16 static registers and 48 windowed or rotating registers. codice_4 always reads 1 (true).
* 8 branch registers, for the addresses of indirect jumps. codice_5 is set to the return address when a function is called with codice_6.
* 128 special purpose (or &quot;application&quot;) registers, which are mostly of interest to the kernel and not ordinary applications. For example, one register called codice_7 points to the second stack, which is where the hardware will automatically spill registers when the register window wraps around.

Each 128-bit instruction word is called a &quot;bundle&quot;, and contains three &quot;slots&quot; each holding a 41-bit instruction, plus a 5-bit &quot;template&quot; indicating which type of instruction is in each slot. Those types are M-unit (memory instructions), I-unit (integer ALU, non-ALU integer, or long immediate extended instructions), F-unit (floating-point instructions), or B-unit (branch or long branch extended instructions). The template also encodes &quot;stops&quot; which indicate that a data dependency exists between data before and after the stop. All instructions between a pair of stops constitute an &quot;instruction group&quot;, regardless of their bundling, and must be free of many types of data dependencies; this knowledge allows the processor to execute instructions in parallel without having to perform its own complicated data analysis, since that analysis was already done when the instructions were written.

Within each slot, all but a few instructions are predicated, specifying a predicate register, the value of which (true or false) will determine whether the instruction is executed. Predicated instructions which should always execute are predicated on codice_4, which always reads as true.

The IA-64 assembly language and instruction format was deliberately designed to be written mainly by compilers, not by humans. Instructions must be grouped into bundles of three, ensuring that the three instructions match an allowed template. Instructions must issue stops between certain types of data dependencies, and stops can also only be used in limited places according to the allowed templates.

=== Instruction execution ===

The fetch mechanism can read up to two bundles per clock from the L1 cache into the pipeline. When the compiler can take maximum advantage of this, the processor can execute six instructions per clock cycle. The processor has thirty functional execution units in eleven groups. Each unit can execute a particular subset of the instruction set, and each unit executes at a rate of one instruction per cycle unless execution stalls waiting for data. While not all units in a group execute identical subsets of the instruction set, common instructions can be executed in multiple units.

The execution unit groups include:
* Six general-purpose ALUs, two integer units, one shift unit
* Four data cache units
* Six multimedia units, two parallel shift units, one parallel multiply, one population count
* Two 82-bit floating-point multiply–accumulate units, two SIMD floating-point multiply–accumulate units (two 32-bit operations each)
* Three branch units

Ideally, the compiler can often group instructions into sets of six that can execute at the same time. Since the floating-point units implement a multiply–accumulate operation, a single floating-point instruction can perform the work of two instructions when the application requires a multiply followed by an add: this is very common in scientific processing. When it occurs, the processor can execute four FLOPs per cycle. For example, the 800 MHz Itanium had a theoretical rating of 3.2 GFLOPS and the fastest Itanium 2, at 1.67 GHz, was rated at 6.67 GFLOPS.

In practice, the processor may often be underutilized, with not all slots filled with useful instructions due to e.g. data dependencies or limitations in the available bundle templates. The densest possible code requires 42.6 bits per instruction, compared to 32 bits per instruction on traditional RISC processors of the time, and no-ops due to wasted slots further decrease the density of code. Additional instructions for speculative loads and hints for branches and cache are impractical to generate optimally, because a compiler cannot predict the contents of the different cache levels on a system running multiple processes and taking interrupts.

=== Memory architecture ===

From 2002 to 2006, Itanium 2 processors shared a common cache hierarchy. They had 16 KB of Level 1 instruction cache and 16 KB of Level 1 data cache. The L2 cache was unified (both instruction and data) and is 256 KB. The Level 3 cache was also unified and varied in size from 1.5 MB to 24 MB. The 256 KB L2 cache contains sufficient logic to handle semaphore operations without disturbing the main arithmetic logic unit (ALU).

Main memory is accessed through a bus to an off-chip chipset. The Itanium 2 bus was initially called the McKinley bus, but is now usually referred to as the Itanium bus. The speed of the bus has increased steadily with new processor releases. The bus transfers 2×128 bits per clock cycle, so the 200 MHz McKinley bus transferred 6.4 GB/s, and the 533 MHz Montecito bus transfers 17.056 GB/s

=== Architectural changes ===
Itanium processors released prior to 2006 had hardware support for the IA-32 architecture to permit support for legacy server applications, but performance for IA-32 code was much worse than for native code and also worse than the performance of contemporaneous x86 processors. In 2005, Intel developed the IA-32 Execution Layer (IA-32 EL), a software emulator that provides better performance. With Montecito, Intel therefore eliminated hardware support for IA-32 code.

In 2006, with the release of Montecito, Intel made a number of enhancements to the basic processor architecture including:
* Hardware multithreading: Each processor core maintains context for two threads of execution. When one thread stalls during memory access, the other thread can execute. Intel calls this &quot;coarse multithreading&quot; to distinguish it from the &quot;hyper-threading technology&quot; Intel integrated into some x86 and x86-64 microprocessors.
* Hardware support for virtualization: Intel added Intel Virtualization Technology (Intel VT-i), which provides hardware assists for core virtualization functions. Virtualization allows a software &quot;hypervisor&quot; to run multiple operating system instances on the processor concurrently.
* Cache enhancements: Montecito added a split L2 cache, which included a dedicated 1 MB L2 cache for instructions. The original 256 KB L2 cache was converted to a dedicated data cache. Montecito also included up to 12 MB of on-die L3 cache.

<doc id="85425" wikidata="Q19596" url="?curid=85425" title="Metalloid">
<text>A metalloid is a chemical element which has a preponderance of properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals. The word metalloid comes from the Latin &quot;metallum&quot; (&quot;metal&quot;) and the Greek &quot;oeides&quot; (&quot;resembling in form or appearance&quot;). There is no standard definition of a metalloid and no complete agreement on which elements are metalloids. Despite the lack of specificity, the term remains in use in the literature.

The six commonly recognised metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium. Five elements are less frequently so classified: carbon, aluminium, selenium, polonium and astatine. On a standard periodic table, all eleven elements are in a diagonal region of the p-block extending from boron at the upper left to astatine at lower right. Some periodic tables include a dividing line between metals and nonmetals, and the metalloids may be found close to this line.

Typical metalloids have a metallic appearance, may be brittle and are only fair conductors of electricity. They can form alloys with metals, and many of their other physical properties and chemical properties are intermediate between those of metallic and nonmetallic elements. They and their compounds are used in alloys, biological agents, catalysts, flame retardants, glasses, optical storage and optoelectronics, pyrotechnics, semiconductors, and electronics.

The term &quot;metalloid&quot; originally referred to nonmetals. Its more recent meaning, as a category of elements with intermediate or hybrid properties, became widespread in 1940–1960. Metalloids are sometimes called semimetals, a practice that has been discouraged, as the term &quot;semimetal&quot; has a more common usage as a specific kind of electronic band structure of a substance. In this context, only arsenic and antimony are semimetals, and commonly recognised as metalloids.

==Definitions==
===Judgment-based===
A metalloid is an element that possesses a preponderance of properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements at or near the margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.

Boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium are commonly recognised as metalloids. Depending on the author, one or more from selenium, polonium, or astatine are sometimes added to the list. Boron sometimes is excluded, by itself, or with silicon. Sometimes tellurium is not regarded as a metalloid. The inclusion of antimony, polonium, and astatine as metalloids has been questioned.

Other elements are occasionally classified as metalloids. These elements include hydrogen, beryllium, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, zinc, gallium, tin, iodine, lead, bismuth, and radon. The term metalloid has also been used for elements that exhibit metallic lustre and electrical conductivity, and that are amphoteric, such as arsenic, antimony, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, tin, lead, and aluminium. The p-block metals, and nonmetals (such as carbon or nitrogen) that can form alloys with metals or modify their properties have also occasionally been considered as metalloids.

===Criteria-based===

No widely accepted definition of a metalloid exists, nor any division of the periodic table into metals, metalloids, and nonmetals; Hawkes questioned the feasibility of establishing a specific definition, noting that anomalies can be found in several attempted constructs. Classifying an element as a metalloid has been described by Sharp as &quot;arbitrary&quot;.

The number and identities of metalloids depend on what classification criteria are used. Emsley recognised four metalloids (germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium); James et al. listed twelve (Emsley&#x27;s plus boron, carbon, silicon, selenium, bismuth, polonium, moscovium, and livermorium). On average, seven elements are included in such lists; individual classification arrangements tend to share common ground and vary in the ill-defined margins.

A single quantitative criterion such as electronegativity is commonly used, metalloids having electronegativity values from 1.8 or 1.9 to 2.2. Further examples include packing efficiency (the fraction of volume in a crystal structure occupied by atoms) and the Goldhammer–Herzfeld criterion ratio. The commonly recognised metalloids have packing efficiencies of between 34% and 41%. The Goldhammer–Herzfeld ratio, roughly equal to the cube of the atomic radius divided by the molar volume, is a simple measure of how metallic an element is, the recognised metalloids having ratios from around 0.85 to 1.1 and averaging 1.0.
Other authors have relied on, for example, atomic conductance or bulk coordination number.

Jones, writing on the role of classification in science, observed that &quot;[classes] are usually defined by more than two attributes&quot;. Masterton and Slowinski used three criteria to describe the six elements commonly recognised as metalloids: metalloids have ionization energies around 200 kcal/mol (837 kJ/mol) and electronegativity values close to 2.0. They also said that metalloids are typically semiconductors, though antimony and arsenic (semimetals from a physics perspective) have electrical conductivities approaching those of metals. Selenium and polonium are suspected as not in this scheme, while astatine&#x27;s status is uncertain.

In this context, Vernon proposed that a metalloid is a chemical element that, in its standard state, has (a) the electronic band structure of a semiconductor or a semimetal; and (b) an intermediate first ionization potential &quot;(say 750−1,000 kJ/mol)&quot;; and (c) an intermediate electronegativity (1.9–2.2).
==Periodic table territory==
===Location===
Metalloids lie on either side of the dividing line between metals and nonmetals. This can be found, in varying configurations, on some periodic tables. Elements to the lower left of the line generally display increasing metallic behaviour; elements to the upper right display increasing nonmetallic behaviour. When presented as a regular stairstep, elements with the highest critical temperature for their groups (Li, Be, Al, Ge, Sb, Po) lie just below the line.

The diagonal positioning of the metalloids represents an exception to the observation that elements with similar properties tend to occur in vertical groups. A related effect can be seen in other diagonal similarities between some elements and their lower right neighbours, specifically lithium-magnesium, beryllium-aluminium, and boron-silicon. Rayner-Canham has argued that these similarities extend to carbon-phosphorus, nitrogen-sulfur, and into three d-block series.

This exception arises due to competing horizontal and vertical trends in the nuclear charge. Going along a period, the nuclear charge increases with atomic number as do the number of electrons. The additional pull on outer electrons as nuclear charge increases generally outweighs the screening effect of having more electrons. With some irregularities, atoms therefore become smaller, ionization energy increases, and there is a gradual change in character, across a period, from strongly metallic, to weakly metallic, to weakly nonmetallic, to strongly nonmetallic elements. Going down a main group, the effect of increasing nuclear charge is generally outweighed by the effect of additional electrons being further away from the nucleus. Atoms generally become larger, ionization energy falls, and metallic character increases. The net effect is that the location of the metal–nonmetal transition zone shifts to the right in going down a group, and analogous diagonal similarities are seen elsewhere in the periodic table, as noted.

===Alternative treatments===
Elements bordering the metal–nonmetal dividing line are not always classified as metalloids, noting a binary classification can facilitate the establishment of rules for determining bond types between metals and nonmetals. In such cases, the authors concerned focus on one or more attributes of interest to make their classification decisions, rather than being concerned about the marginal nature of the elements in question. Their considerations may or not be made explicit and may, at times, seem arbitrary. Metalloids may be grouped with metals; or regarded as nonmetals; or treated as a sub-category of nonmetals. Other authors have suggested classifying some elements as metalloids &quot;emphasizes that properties change gradually rather than abruptly as one moves across or down the periodic table&quot;. Some periodic tables distinguish elements that are metalloids and display no formal dividing line between metals and nonmetals. Metalloids are instead shown as occurring in a diagonal band or diffuse region. The key consideration is to explain the context for the taxonomy in use.

==Properties==
Metalloids usually look like metals but behave largely like nonmetals. Physically, they are shiny, brittle solids with intermediate to relatively good electrical conductivity and the electronic band structure of a semimetal or semiconductor. Chemically, they mostly behave as (weak) nonmetals, have intermediate ionization energies and electronegativity values, and amphoteric or weakly acidic oxides. Most of their other physical and chemical properties are intermediate in nature.

===Compared to metals and nonmetals===

Characteristic properties of metals, metalloids, and nonmetals are summarized in the table. Physical properties are listed in order of ease of determination; chemical properties run from general to specific, and then to descriptive.
The above table reflects the hybrid nature of metalloids. The properties of &quot;form, appearance&quot;, and &quot;behaviour when mixed with metals&quot; are more like metals. &quot;Elasticity&quot; and &quot;general chemical behaviour&quot; are more like nonmetals. &quot;Electrical conductivity, band structure, ionization energy, electronegativity,&quot; and &quot;oxides&quot; are intermediate between the two.

==Common applications==
:&quot;The focus of this section is on the recognised metalloids. Elements less often recognised as metalloids are ordinarily classified as either metals or nonmetals; some of these are included here for comparative purposes.&quot;
Metalloids are too brittle to have any structural uses in their pure forms. They and their compounds are used in alloys, biological agents (toxicological, nutritional, and medicinal), catalysts, flame retardants, glasses (oxide and metallic), optical storage media and optoelectronics, pyrotechnics, semiconductors, and electronics.

===Alloys===

Writing early in the history of intermetallic compounds, the British metallurgist Cecil Desch observed that &quot;certain non-metallic elements are capable of forming compounds of distinctly metallic character with metals, and these elements may therefore enter into the composition of alloys&quot;. He associated silicon, arsenic, and tellurium, in particular, with the alloy-forming elements. Phillips and Williams suggested that compounds of silicon, germanium, arsenic, and antimony with B metals, &quot;are probably best classed as alloys&quot;.

Among the lighter metalloids, alloys with transition metals are well-represented. Boron can form intermetallic compounds and alloys with such metals of the composition M&quot;n&quot;B, if &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2. Ferroboron (15% boron) is used to introduce boron into steel; nickel-boron alloys are ingredients in welding alloys and case hardening compositions for the engineering industry. Alloys of silicon with iron and with aluminium are widely used by the steel and automotive industries, respectively. Germanium forms many alloys, most importantly with the coinage metals.

The heavier metalloids continue the theme. Arsenic can form alloys with metals, including platinum and copper; it is also added to copper and its alloys to improve corrosion resistance and appears to confer the same benefit when added to magnesium. Antimony is well known as an alloy-former, including with the coinage metals. Its alloys include pewter (a tin alloy with up to 20% antimony) and type metal (a lead alloy with up to 25% antimony). Tellurium readily alloys with iron, as ferrotellurium (50–58% tellurium), and with copper, in the form of copper tellurium (40–50% tellurium). Ferrotellurium is used as a stabilizer for carbon in steel casting. Of the non-metallic elements less often recognised as metalloids, selenium – in the form of ferroselenium (50–58% selenium) – is used to improve the machinability of stainless steels.

===Biological agents===
 All six of the elements commonly recognised as metalloids have toxic, dietary or medicinal properties. Arsenic and antimony compounds are especially toxic; boron, silicon, and possibly arsenic, are essential trace elements. Boron, silicon, arsenic, and antimony have medical applications, and germanium and tellurium are thought to have potential.

Boron is used in insecticides and herbicides. It is an essential trace element. As boric acid, it has antiseptic, antifungal, and antiviral properties.

Silicon is present in silatrane, a highly toxic rodenticide. Long-term inhalation of silica dust causes silicosis, a fatal disease of the lungs. Silicon is an essential trace element. Silicone gel can be applied to badly burned patients to reduce scarring.

Salts of germanium are potentially harmful to humans and animals if ingested on a prolonged basis. There is interest in the pharmacological actions of germanium compounds but no licensed medicine as yet.

Arsenic is notoriously poisonous and may also be an essential element in ultratrace amounts. During World War I, both sides used &quot;arsenic-based sneezing and vomiting agents…to force enemy soldiers to remove their gas masks before firing mustard or phosgene at them in a second salvo.&quot; It has been used as a pharmaceutical agent since antiquity, including for the treatment of syphilis before the development of antibiotics. Arsenic is also a component of melarsoprol, a medicinal drug used in the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness. In 2003, arsenic trioxide (under the trade name Trisenox) was re-introduced for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Arsenic in drinking water, which causes lung and bladder cancer, has been associated with a reduction in breast cancer mortality rates.

Metallic antimony is relatively non-toxic, but most antimony compounds are poisonous.
Two antimony compounds, sodium stibogluconate and stibophen, are used as antiparasitical drugs.

Elemental tellurium is not considered particularly toxic; two grams of sodium tellurate, if administered, can be lethal. People exposed to small amounts of airborne tellurium exude a foul and persistent garlic-like odour. Tellurium dioxide has been used to treat seborrhoeic dermatitis; other tellurium compounds were used as antimicrobial agents before the development of antibiotics. In the future, such compounds may need to be substituted for antibiotics that have become ineffective due to bacterial resistance.

Of the elements less often recognised as metalloids, beryllium and lead are noted for their toxicity; lead arsenate has been extensively used as an insecticide. Sulfur is one of the oldest of the fungicides and pesticides. Phosphorus, sulfur, zinc, selenium, and iodine are essential nutrients, and aluminium, tin, and lead may be. Sulfur, gallium, selenium, iodine, and bismuth have medicinal applications. Sulfur is a constituent of sulfonamide drugs, still widely used for conditions such as acne and urinary tract infections. Gallium nitrate is used to treat the side effects of cancer; gallium citrate, a radiopharmaceutical, facilitates imaging of inflamed body areas. Selenium sulfide is used in medicinal shampoos and to treat skin infections such as tinea versicolor. Iodine is used as a disinfectant in various forms. Bismuth is an ingredient in some antibacterials.

===Catalysts===
Boron trifluoride and trichloride are used as homogeneous catalysts in organic synthesis and electronics; the tribromide is used in the manufacture of diborane. Non-toxic boron ligands could replace toxic phosphorus ligands in some transition metal catalysts. Silica sulfuric acid (SiO2OSO3H) is used in organic reactions. Germanium dioxide is sometimes used as a catalyst in the production of PET plastic for containers; cheaper antimony compounds, such as the trioxide or triacetate, are more commonly employed for the same purpose despite concerns about antimony contamination of food and drinks. Arsenic trioxide has been used in the production of natural gas, to boost the removal of carbon dioxide, as have selenous acid and tellurous acid. Selenium acts as a catalyst in some microorganisms. Tellurium, its dioxide, and its tetrachloride are strong catalysts for air oxidation of carbon above 500 °C. Graphite oxide can be used as a catalyst in the synthesis of imines and their derivatives. Activated carbon and alumina have been used as catalysts for the removal of sulfur contaminants from natural gas. Titanium doped aluminium has been suggested as a substitute for noble metal catalysts used in the production of industrial chemicals.

===Flame retardants===
Compounds of boron, silicon, arsenic, and antimony have been used as flame retardants. Boron, in the form of borax, has been used as a textile flame retardant since at least the 18th century. Silicon compounds such as silicones, silanes, silsesquioxane, silica, and silicates, some of which were developed as alternatives to more toxic halogenated products, can considerably improve the flame retardancy of plastic materials.
Arsenic compounds such as sodium arsenite or sodium arsenate are effective flame retardants for wood but have been less frequently used due to their toxicity. Antimony trioxide is a flame retardant. Aluminium hydroxide has been used as a wood-fibre, rubber, plastic, and textile flame retardant since the 1890s. Apart from aluminium hydroxide, use of phosphorus based flame-retardants – in the form of, for example, organophosphates – now exceeds that of any of the other main retardant types. These employ boron, antimony, or halogenated hydrocarbon compounds.

===Glass formation===

The oxides B2O3, SiO2, GeO2, As2O3, and Sb2O3 readily form glasses. TeO2 forms a glass but this requires a &quot;heroic quench rate&quot; or the addition of an impurity; otherwise the crystalline form results. These compounds are used in chemical, domestic, and industrial glassware and optics. Boron trioxide is used as a glass fibre additive, and is also a component of borosilicate glass, widely used for laboratory glassware and domestic ovenware for its low thermal expansion. Most ordinary glassware is made from silicon dioxide. Germanium dioxide is used as a glass fibre additive, as well as in infrared optical systems. Arsenic trioxide is used in the glass industry as a decolourizing and fining agent (for the removal of bubbles), as is antimony trioxide. Tellurium dioxide finds application in laser and nonlinear optics.

Amorphous metallic glasses are generally most easily prepared if one of the components is a metalloid or &quot;near metalloid&quot; such as boron, carbon, silicon, phosphorus or germanium. Aside from thin films deposited at very low temperatures, the first known metallic glass was an alloy of composition Au75Si25 reported in 1960. A metallic glass having a strength and toughness not previously seen, of composition Pd82.5P6Si9.5Ge2, was reported in 2011.

Phosphorus, selenium, and lead, which are less often recognised as metalloids, are also used in glasses. Phosphate glass has a substrate of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), rather than the silica (SiO2) of conventional silicate glasses. It is used, for example, to make sodium lamps. Selenium compounds can be used both as decolourising agents and to add a red colour to glass. Decorative glassware made of traditional lead glass contains at least 30% lead(II) oxide (PbO); lead glass used for radiation shielding may have up to 65% PbO. Lead-based glasses have also been extensively used in electronic components, enamelling, sealing and glazing materials, and solar cells. Bismuth based oxide glasses have emerged as a less toxic replacement for lead in many of these applications.

===Optical storage and optoelectronics===
Varying compositions of GeSbTe (&quot;GST alloys&quot;) and Ag- and In- doped Sb2Te (&quot;AIST alloys&quot;), being examples of phase-change materials, are widely used in rewritable optical discs and phase-change memory devices. By applying heat, they can be switched between amorphous (glassy) and crystalline states. The change in optical and electrical properties can be used for information storage purposes. Future applications for GeSbTe may include, &quot;ultrafast, entirely solid-state displays with nanometre-scale pixels, semi-transparent &#x27;smart&#x27; glasses, &#x27;smart&#x27; contact lenses, and artificial retina devices.&quot;

===Pyrotechnics===

The recognised metalloids have either pyrotechnic applications or associated properties. Boron and silicon are commonly encountered; they act somewhat like metal fuels. Boron is used in pyrotechnic initiator compositions (for igniting other hard-to-start compositions), and in delay compositions that burn at a constant rate. Boron carbide has been identified as a possible replacement for more toxic barium or hexachloroethane mixtures in smoke munitions, signal flares, and fireworks. Silicon, like boron, is a component of initiator and delay mixtures. Doped germanium can act as a variable speed thermite fuel. Arsenic trisulfide As2S3 was used in old naval signal lights; in fireworks to make white stars; in yellow smoke screen mixtures; and in initiator compositions. Antimony trisulfide Sb2S3 is found in white-light fireworks and in flash and sound mixtures. Tellurium has been used in delay mixtures and in blasting cap initiator compositions.

Carbon, aluminium, phosphorus, and selenium continue the theme. Carbon, in black powder, is a constituent of fireworks rocket propellants, bursting charges, and effects mixtures, and military delay fuses and igniters. Aluminium is a common pyrotechnic ingredient, and is widely employed for its capacity to generate light and heat, including in thermite mixtures. Phosphorus can be found in smoke and incendiary munitions, paper caps used in toy guns, and party poppers. Selenium has been used in the same way as tellurium.

===Semiconductors and electronics===
All the elements commonly recognised as metalloids (or their compounds) have been used in the semiconductor or solid-state electronic industries.

Some properties of boron have limited its use as a semiconductor. It has a high melting point, single crystals are relatively hard to obtain, and introducing and retaining controlled impurities is difficult.

Silicon is the leading commercial semiconductor; it forms the basis of modern electronics (including standard solar cells) and information and communication technologies. This was despite the study of semiconductors, early in the 20th century, having been regarded as the &quot;physics of dirt&quot; and not deserving of close attention.

Germanium has largely been replaced by silicon in semiconducting devices, being cheaper, more resilient at higher operating temperatures, and easier to work during the microelectronic fabrication process. Germanium is still a constituent of semiconducting silicon-germanium &quot;alloys&quot; and these have been growing in use, particularly for wireless communication devices; such alloys exploit the higher carrier mobility of germanium. The synthesis of gram-scale quantities of semiconducting germanane was reported in 2013. This consists of one-atom thick sheets of hydrogen-terminated germanium atoms, analogous to graphane. It conducts electrons more than ten times faster than silicon and five times faster than germanium, and is thought to have potential for optoelectronic and sensing applications. The development of a germanium-wire based anode that more than doubles the capacity of lithium-ion batteries was reported in 2014. In the same year, Lee et al. reported that defect-free crystals of graphene large enough to have electronic uses could be grown on, and removed from, a germanium substrate.

Arsenic and antimony are not semiconductors in their standard states. Both form type III-V semiconductors (such as GaAs, AlSb or GaInAsSb) in which the average number of valence electrons per atom is the same as that of Group 14 elements, but they have direct band gaps. These compounds are preferred for optical applications. Antimony nanocrystals may enable lithium-ion batteries to be replaced by more powerful sodium ion batteries.

Tellurium, which is a semiconductor in its standard state, is used mainly as a component in type II/VI semiconducting-chalcogenides; these have applications in electro-optics and electronics. Cadmium telluride (CdTe) is used in solar modules for its high conversion efficiency, low manufacturing costs, and large band gap of 1.44 eV, letting it absorb a wide range of wavelengths. Bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3), alloyed with selenium and antimony, is a component of thermoelectric devices used for refrigeration or portable power generation.

Five metalloids – boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, and antimony – can be found in cell phones (along with at least 39 other metals and nonmetals). Tellurium is expected to find such use. Of the less often recognised metalloids, phosphorus, gallium (in particular) and selenium have semiconductor applications. Phosphorus is used in trace amounts as a dopant for n-type semiconductors. The commercial use of gallium compounds is dominated by semiconductor applications – in integrated circuits, cell phones, laser diodes, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and solar cells. Selenium is used in the production of solar cells and in high-energy surge protectors.

Boron, silicon, germanium, antimony, and tellurium, as well as heavier metals and metalloids such as Sm, Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi, and Se, can be found in topological insulators. These are alloys or compounds which, at ultracold temperatures or room temperature (depending on their composition), are metallic conductors on their surfaces but insulators through their interiors. Cadmium arsenide Cd3As2, at about 1 K, is a Dirac-semimetal – a bulk electronic analogue of graphene – in which electrons travel effectively as massless particles. These two classes of material are thought to have potential quantum computing applications.
==Nomenclature and history==

===Derivation and other names===
Several names are sometimes used synonymously although some of these have other meanings that are not necessarily interchangeable: &quot;amphoteric element,&quot; &quot;boundary element,&quot; &quot;half-way element,&quot; &quot;near metal,&quot; &quot;meta-metal,&quot; &quot;semiconductor,&quot; &quot;semimetal&quot; and &quot;submetal&quot;. &quot;Amphoteric element&quot; is sometimes used more broadly to include transition metals capable of forming oxyanions, such as chromium and manganese. &quot;Meta-metal&quot; is sometimes used instead to refer to certain metals (Be, Zn, Cd, Hg, In, Tl, β-Sn, Pb) located just to the left of the metalloids on standard periodic tables. These metals tend to have distorted crystalline structures, electrical conductivity values at the lower end of those of metals, and amphoteric (weakly basic) oxides. The names &quot;amphoteric element&quot; and &quot;semiconductor&quot; are problematic as some elements referred to as metalloids do not show marked amphoteric behaviour (bismuth, for example) or semiconductivity (polonium) in their most stable forms.

===Origin and usage===

The origin and usage of the term &quot;metalloid&quot; is convoluted. The &quot;Manual of Metalloids&quot; published in 1864 divided all elements into either metals or metalloids. Earlier usage in mineralogy, to describe a mineral having a metallic appearance, can be sourced to as early as 1800. Since the mid-20th century it has been used to refer to intermediate or borderline chemical elements. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) previously recommended abandoning the term metalloid, and suggested using the term &quot;semimetal&quot; instead. Use of this latter term has more recently been discouraged by Atkins et al. as it has a more common meaning that refers to the electronic band structure of a substance rather than the overall classification of an element. The most recent IUPAC publications on nomenclature and terminology do not include any recommendations on the usage of the terms metalloid or semimetal.

==Elements commonly recognised as metalloids==
:&quot;Properties noted in this section refer to the elements in their most thermodynamically stable forms under ambient conditions.&quot;

===Boron===

 Pure boron is a shiny, silver-grey crystalline solid. It is less dense than aluminium (2.34 vs. 2.70 g/cm3), and is hard and brittle. It is barely reactive under normal conditions, except for attack by fluorine, and has a melting point of 2076 °C (cf. steel ~1370 °C). Boron is a semiconductor; its room temperature electrical conductivity is 1.5 × 10−6 S•cm−1 (about 200 times less than that of tap water) and it has a band gap of about 1.56 eV. Mendeleev commented that, &quot;Boron appears in a free state in several forms which are intermediate between the metals and the nonmmetals.&quot;
The structural chemistry of boron is dominated by its small atomic size, and relatively high ionization energy. With only three valence electrons per boron atom, simple covalent bonding cannot fulfil the octet rule. Metallic bonding is the usual result among the heavier congenors of boron but this generally requires low ionization energies. Instead, because of its small size and high ionization energies, the basic structural unit of boron (and nearly all of its allotropes) is the icosahedral B12 cluster. Of the 36 electrons associated with 12 boron atoms, 26 reside in 13 delocalized molecular orbitals; the other 10 electrons are used to form two- and three-centre covalent bonds between icosahedra. The same motif can be seen, as are deltahedral variants or fragments, in metal borides and hydride derivatives, and in some halides.

The bonding in boron has been described as being characteristic of behaviour intermediate between metals and nonmetallic covalent network solids (such as diamond). The energy required to transform B, C, N, Si, and P from nonmetallic to metallic states has been estimated as 30, 100, 240, 33, and 50 kJ/mol, respectively. This indicates the proximity of boron to the metal-nonmetal borderline.

Most of the chemistry of boron is nonmetallic in nature. Unlike its heavier congeners, it is not known to form a simple B3+ or hydrated [B(H2O)4]3+ cation. The small size of the boron atom enables the preparation of many interstitial alloy-type borides. Analogies between boron and transition metals have been noted in the formation of complexes, and adducts (for example, BH3 + CO →BH3CO and, similarly, Fe(CO)4 + CO →Fe(CO)5), as well as in the geometric and electronic structures of cluster species such as [B6H6]2− and [Ru6(CO)18]2−. The aqueous chemistry of boron is characterised by the formation of many different polyborate anions. Given its high charge-to-size ratio, boron bonds covalently in nearly all of its compounds; the exceptions are the borides as these include, depending on their composition, covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding components. Simple binary compounds, such as boron trichloride are Lewis acids as the formation of three covalent bonds leaves a hole in the octet which can be filled by an electron-pair donated by a Lewis base. Boron has a strong affinity for oxygen and a duly extensive borate chemistry. The oxide B2O3 is polymeric in structure, weakly acidic, and a glass former. Organometallic compounds of boron have been known since the 19th century (see organoboron chemistry).

===Silicon===
Silicon is a crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic lustre. Like boron, it is less dense (at 2.33 g/cm3) than aluminium, and is hard and brittle. It is a relatively unreactive element. According to Rochow, the massive crystalline form (especially if pure) is &quot;remarkably inert to all acids, including hydrofluoric&quot;. Less pure silicon, and the powdered form, are variously susceptible to attack by strong or heated acids, as well as by steam and fluorine. Silicon dissolves in hot aqueous alkalis with the evolution of hydrogen, as do metals such as beryllium, aluminium, zinc, gallium or indium. It melts at 1414 °C. Silicon is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of 10−4 S•cm−1 and a band gap of about 1.11 eV. When it melts, silicon becomes a reasonable metal with an electrical conductivity of 1.0–1.3 × 104 S•cm−1, similar to that of liquid mercury.

The chemistry of silicon is generally nonmetallic (covalent) in nature. It is not known to form a cation. Silicon can form alloys with metals such as iron and copper. It shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. The high strength of the silicon–oxygen bond dominates the chemical behaviour of silicon. Polymeric silicates, built up by tetrahedral SiO4 units sharing their oxygen atoms, are the most abundant and important compounds of silicon. The polymeric borates, comprising linked trigonal and tetrahedral BO3 or BO4 units, are built on similar structural principles. The oxide SiO2 is polymeric in structure, weakly acidic, and a glass former. Traditional organometallic chemistry includes the carbon compounds of silicon (see organosilicon).

===Germanium===
Germanium is a shiny grey-white solid. It has a density of 5.323 g/cm3 and is hard and brittle. It is mostly unreactive at room temperature but is slowly attacked by hot concentrated sulfuric or nitric acid. Germanium also reacts with molten caustic soda to yield sodium germanate Na2GeO3 and hydrogen gas. It melts at 938 °C. Germanium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 2 × 10−2 S•cm−1 and a band gap of 0.67 eV. Liquid germanium is a metallic conductor, with an electrical conductivity similar to that of liquid mercury.

Most of the chemistry of germanium is characteristic of a nonmetal. Whether or not germanium forms a cation is unclear, aside from the reported existence of the Ge2+ ion in a few esoteric compounds. It can form alloys with metals such as aluminium and gold. It shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. Germanium generally forms tetravalent (IV) compounds, and it can also form less stable divalent (II) compounds, in which it behaves more like a metal. Germanium analogues of all of the major types of silicates have been prepared. The metallic character of germanium is also suggested by the formation of various oxoacid salts. A phosphate [(HPO4)2Ge·H2O] and highly stable trifluoroacetate Ge(OCOCF3)4 have been described, as have Ge2(SO4)2, Ge(ClO4)4 and GeH2(C2O4)3. The oxide GeO2 is polymeric, amphoteric, and a glass former. The dioxide is soluble in acidic solutions (the monoxide GeO, is even more so), and this is sometimes used to classify germanium as a metal. Up to the 1930s germanium was considered to be a poorly conducting metal; it has occasionally been classified as a metal by later writers. As with all the elements commonly recognised as metalloids, germanium has an established organometallic chemistry (see Organogermanium chemistry).

===Arsenic===
Arsenic is a grey, metallic looking solid. It has a density of 5.727 g/cm3 and is brittle, and moderately hard (more than aluminium; less than iron). It is stable in dry air but develops a golden bronze patina in moist air, which blackens on further exposure. Arsenic is attacked by nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid. It reacts with fused caustic soda to give the arsenate Na3AsO3 and hydrogen gas. Arsenic sublimes at 615 °C. The vapour is lemon-yellow and smells like garlic. Arsenic only melts under a pressure of 38.6 atm, at 817 °C. It is a semimetal with an electrical conductivity of around 3.9 × 104 S•cm−1 and a band overlap of 0.5 eV. Liquid arsenic is a semiconductor with a band gap of 0.15 eV.

The chemistry of arsenic is predominately nonmetallic. Whether or not arsenic forms a cation is unclear. Its many metal alloys are mostly brittle. It shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. Arsenic generally forms compounds in which it has an oxidation state of +3 or +5. The halides, and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples. In the trivalent state, arsenic shows some incipient metallic properties. The halides are hydrolysed by water but these reactions, particularly those of the chloride, are reversible with the addition of a hydrohalic acid. The oxide is acidic but, as noted below, (weakly) amphoteric. The higher, less stable, pentavalent state has strongly acidic (nonmetallic) properties. Compared to phosphorus, the stronger metallic character of arsenic is indicated by the formation of oxoacid salts such as AsPO4, As2(SO4)3 and arsenic acetate As(CH3COO)3. The oxide As2O3 is polymeric, amphoteric, and a glass former. Arsenic has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see Organoarsenic chemistry).

===Antimony===
Antimony is a silver-white solid with a blue tint and a brilliant lustre. It has a density of 6.697 g/cm3 and is brittle, and moderately hard (more so than arsenic; less so than iron; about the same as copper). It is stable in air and moisture at room temperature. It is attacked by concentrated nitric acid, yielding the hydrated pentoxide Sb2O5. Aqua regia gives the pentachloride SbCl5 and hot concentrated sulfuric acid results in the sulfate Sb2(SO4)3. It is not affected by molten alkali. Antimony is capable of displacing hydrogen from water, when heated: 2 Sb + 3 H2O → Sb2O3 + 3 H2. It melts at 631 °C. Antimony is a semimetal with an electrical conductivity of around 3.1 × 104 S•cm−1 and a band overlap of 0.16 eV. Liquid antimony is a metallic conductor with an electrical conductivity of around 5.3 × 104 S•cm−1.

Most of the chemistry of antimony is characteristic of a nonmetal. Antimony has some definite cationic chemistry, SbO+ and Sb(OH)2+ being present in acidic aqueous solution; the compound Sb8(GaCl4)2, which contains the homopolycation, Sb82+, was prepared in 2004. It can form alloys with one or more metals such as aluminium, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, tin, lead, and bismuth. Antimony has fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. Like arsenic, antimony generally forms compounds in which it has an oxidation state of +3 or +5. The halides, and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples. The +5 state is less stable than the +3, but relatively easier to attain than with arsenic. This is explained by the poor shielding afforded the arsenic nucleus by its 3d10 electrons. In comparison, the tendency of antimony (being a heavier atom) to oxidize more easily partially offsets the effect of its 4d10 shell. Tripositive antimony is amphoteric; pentapositive antimony is (predominately) acidic. Consistent with an increase in metallic character down group 15, antimony forms salts including an acetate Sb(CH3CO2)3, phosphate SbPO4, sulfate Sb2(SO4)3 and perchlorate Sb(ClO4)3. The otherwise acidic pentoxide Sb2O5 shows some basic (metallic) behaviour in that it can be dissolved in very acidic solutions, with the formation of the oxycation SbO. The oxide Sb2O3 is polymeric, amphoteric, and a glass former. Antimony has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see Organoantimony chemistry).

===Tellurium===
Tellurium is a silvery-white shiny solid. It has a density of 6.24 g/cm3, is brittle, and is the softest of the commonly recognised metalloids, being marginally harder than sulfur. Large pieces of tellurium are stable in air. The finely powdered form is oxidized by air in the presence of moisture. Tellurium reacts with boiling water, or when freshly precipitated even at 50 °C, to give the dioxide and hydrogen: Te + 2 H2O → TeO2 + 2 H2. It reacts (to varying degrees) with nitric, sulfuric, and hydrochloric acids to give compounds such as the sulfoxide TeSO3 or tellurous acid H2TeO3, the basic nitrate (Te2O4H)+(NO3)−, or the oxide sulfate Te2O3(SO4). It dissolves in boiling alkalis, to give the tellurite and telluride: 3 Te + 6 KOH = K2TeO3 + 2 K2Te + 3 H2O, a reaction that proceeds or is reversible with increasing or decreasing temperature.

At higher temperatures tellurium is sufficiently plastic to extrude. It melts at 449.51 °C. Crystalline tellurium has a structure consisting of parallel infinite spiral chains. The bonding between adjacent atoms in a chain is covalent, but there is evidence of a weak metallic interaction between the neighbouring atoms of different chains. Tellurium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 1.0 S•cm−1 and a band gap of 0.32 to 0.38 eV. Liquid tellurium is a semiconductor, with an electrical conductivity, on melting, of around 1.9 × 103 S•cm−1. Superheated liquid tellurium is a metallic conductor.

Most of the chemistry of tellurium is characteristic of a nonmetal.
It shows some cationic behaviour. The dioxide dissolves in acid to yield the trihydroxotellurium(IV) Te(OH)3+ ion; the red Te42+ and yellow-orange Te62+ ions form when tellurium is oxidized in fluorosulfuric acid (HSO3F), or liquid sulfur dioxide (SO2), respectively. It can form alloys with aluminium, silver, and tin. Tellurium shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. Tellurium generally forms compounds in which it has an oxidation state of −2, +4 or +6. The +4 state is the most stable. Tellurides of composition X&quot;x&quot;Te&quot;y&quot; are easily formed with most other elements and represent the most common tellurium minerals. Nonstoichiometry is pervasive, especially with transition metals. Many tellurides can be regarded as metallic alloys. The increase in metallic character evident in tellurium, as compared to the lighter chalcogens, is further reflected in the reported formation of various other oxyacid salts, such as a basic selenate 2TeO2·SeO3 and an analogous perchlorate and periodate 2TeO2·HXO4. Tellurium forms a polymeric, amphoteric, glass-forming oxide TeO2. It is a &quot;conditional&quot; glass-forming oxide – it forms a glass with a very small amount of additive. Tellurium has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see Organotellurium chemistry).

==Elements less commonly recognised as metalloids==

===Carbon===
Carbon is ordinarily classified as a nonmetal but has some metallic properties and is occasionally classified as a metalloid. Hexagonal graphitic carbon (graphite) is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of carbon under ambient conditions. It has a lustrous appearance and is a fairly good electrical conductor. Graphite has a layered structure. Each layer consists of carbon atoms bonded to three other carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice arrangement. The layers are stacked together and held loosely by van der Waals forces and delocalized valence electrons.

Like a metal, the conductivity of graphite in the direction of its planes decreases as the temperature is raised; it has the electronic band structure of a semimetal. The allotropes of carbon, including graphite, can accept foreign atoms or compounds into their structures via substitution, intercalation, or doping. The resulting materials are sometimes referred to as &quot;carbon alloys&quot;. Carbon can form ionic salts, including a hydrogen sulfate, perchlorate, and nitrate (CX−.2HX, where X = HSO4, ClO4; and CNO.3HNO3). In organic chemistry, carbon can form complex cationstermed &quot;carbocations&quot;in which the positive charge is on the carbon atom; examples are  and , and their derivatives.

Graphite is an established solid lubricant and behaves as a semiconductor in a direction perpendicular to its planes. Most of its chemistry is nonmetallic; it has a relatively high ionization energy and, compared to most metals, a relatively high electronegativity. Carbon can form anions such as C4− (methanide), C (acetylide), and C (sesquicarbide or allylenide), in compounds with metals of main groups 1–3, and with the lanthanides and actinides. Its oxide CO2 forms carbonic acid H2CO3.

===Aluminium===
Aluminium is ordinarily classified as a metal. It is lustrous, malleable and ductile, and has high electrical and thermal conductivity. Like most metals it has a close-packed crystalline structure, and forms a cation in aqueous solution.

It has some properties that are unusual for a metal; taken together, these are sometimes used as a basis to classify aluminium as a metalloid. Its crystalline structure shows some evidence of directional bonding. Aluminium bonds covalently in most compounds. The oxide Al2O3 is amphoteric and a conditional glass-former. Aluminium can form anionic aluminates, such behaviour being considered nonmetallic in character.

Classifying aluminium as a metalloid has been disputed given its many metallic properties. It is therefore, arguably, an exception to the mnemonic that elements adjacent to the metal–nonmetal dividing line are metalloids.

Stott labels aluminium as a weak metal. It has the physical properties of a metal but some of the chemical properties of a nonmetal. Steele notes the paradoxical chemical behaviour of aluminium: &quot;It resembles a weak metal in its amphoteric oxide and in the covalent character of many of its compounds ... Yet it is a highly electropositive metal ... [with] a high negative electrode potential&quot;. Moody says that, &quot;aluminium is on the &#x27;diagonal borderland&#x27; between metals and non-metals in the chemical sense.&quot;

===Selenium===
Selenium shows borderline metalloid or nonmetal behaviour.

Its most stable form, the grey trigonal allotrope, is sometimes called &quot;metallic&quot; selenium because its electrical conductivity is several orders of magnitude greater than that of the red monoclinic form. The metallic character of selenium is further shown by its lustre, and its crystalline structure, which is thought to include weakly &quot;metallic&quot; interchain bonding. Selenium can be drawn into thin threads when molten and viscous. It shows reluctance to acquire &quot;the high positive oxidation numbers characteristic of nonmetals&quot;. It can form cyclic polycations (such as Se) when dissolved in oleums (an attribute it shares with sulfur and tellurium), and a hydrolysed cationic salt in the form of trihydroxoselenium(IV) perchlorate [Se(OH)3]+·ClO.

The nonmetallic character of selenium is shown by its brittleness and the low electrical conductivity (~10−9 to 10−12 S•cm−1) of its highly purified form. This is comparable to or less than that of bromine (7.95 S•cm−1), a nonmetal. Selenium has the electronic band structure of a semiconductor and retains its semiconducting properties in liquid form. It has a relatively high electronegativity (2.55 revised Pauling scale). Its reaction chemistry is mainly that of its nonmetallic anionic forms Se2−, SeO and SeO.

Selenium is commonly described as a metalloid in the environmental chemistry literature. It moves through the aquatic environment similarly to arsenic and antimony; its water-soluble salts, in higher concentrations, have a similar toxicological profile to that of arsenic.

===Polonium===

Polonium is &quot;distinctly metallic&quot; in some ways. Both of its allotropic forms are metallic conductors. It is soluble in acids, forming the rose-coloured Po2+ cation and displacing hydrogen: Po + 2 H+ → Po2+ + H2. Many polonium salts are known. The oxide PoO2 is predominantly basic in nature. Polonium is a reluctant oxidizing agent, unlike its lightest congener oxygen: highly reducing conditions are required for the formation of the Po2− anion in aqueous solution.

Whether polonium is ductile or brittle is unclear. It is predicted to be ductile based on its calculated elastic constants. It has a simple cubic crystalline structure. Such a structure has few slip systems and &quot;leads to very low ductility and hence low fracture resistance&quot;.

Polonium shows nonmetallic character in its halides, and by the existence of polonides. The halides have properties generally characteristic of nonmetal halides (being volatile, easily hydrolyzed, and soluble in organic solvents). Many metal polonides, obtained by heating the elements together at 500–1,000 °C, and containing the Po2− anion, are also known.

===Astatine===

As a halogen, astatine tends to be classified as a nonmetal. It has some marked metallic properties and is sometimes instead classified as either a metalloid or (less often) as a metal. Immediately following its production in 1940, early investigators considered it a metal. In 1949 it was called the most noble (difficult to reduce) nonmetal as well as being a relatively noble (difficult to oxidize) metal. In 1950 astatine was described as a halogen and (therefore) a reactive nonmetal. In 2013, on the basis of relativistic modelling, astatine was predicted to be a monatomic metal, with a face-centred cubic crystalline structure.

Several authors have commented on the metallic nature of some of the properties of astatine. Since iodine is a semiconductor in the direction of its planes, and since the halogens become more metallic with increasing atomic number, it has been presumed that astatine would be a metal if it could form a condensed phase. Astatine may be metallic in the liquid state on the basis that elements with an enthalpy of vaporization (∆Hvap) greater than ~42 kJ/mol are metallic when liquid. Such elements include boron, silicon, germanium, antimony, selenium, and tellurium. Estimated values for ∆Hvap of diatomic astatine are 50 kJ/mol or higher; diatomic iodine, with a ∆Hvap of 41.71, falls just short of the threshold figure.

&quot;Like typical metals, it [astatine] is precipitated by hydrogen sulfide even from strongly acid solutions and is displaced in a free form from sulfate solutions; it is deposited on the cathode on electrolysis.&quot; Further indications of a tendency for astatine to behave like a (heavy) metal are: &quot;... the formation of pseudohalide compounds ... complexes of astatine cations ... complex anions of trivalent astatine ... as well as complexes with a variety of organic solvents&quot;. It has also been argued that astatine demonstrates cationic behaviour, by way of stable At+ and AtO+ forms, in strongly acidic aqueous solutions.

Some of astatine&#x27;s reported properties are nonmetallic. It has been extrapolated to have the narrow liquid range ordinarily associated with nonmetals (mp 302 °C; bp 337 °C), although experimental indications suggest a lower boiling point of about 230±3 °C. Batsanov gives a calculated band gap energy for astatine of 0.7 eV; this is consistent with nonmetals (in physics) having separated valence and conduction bands and thereby being either semiconductors or insulators. The chemistry of astatine in aqueous solution is mainly characterised by the formation of various anionic species. Most of its known compounds resemble those of iodine, which is a halogen and a nonmetal. Such compounds include astatides (XAt), astatates (XAtO3), and monovalent interhalogen compounds.

Restrepo et al. reported that astatine appeared to be more polonium-like than halogen-like. They did so on the basis of detailed comparative studies of the known and interpolated properties of 72 elements.

===Near metalloids===

In the periodic table, some of the elements adjacent to the commonly recognised metalloids, although usually classified as either metals or nonmetals, are occasionally referred to as &quot;near-metalloids&quot; or noted for their metalloidal character. To the left of the metal–nonmetal dividing line, such elements include gallium, tin and bismuth. They show unusual packing structures, marked covalent chemistry (molecular or polymeric), and amphoterism. To the right of the dividing line are carbon, phosphorus, selenium and iodine. They exhibit metallic lustre, semiconducting properties and bonding or valence bands with delocalized character. This applies to their most thermodynamically stable forms under ambient conditions: carbon as graphite; phosphorus as black phosphorus; and selenium as grey selenium.

===Allotropes===

Different crystalline forms of an element are called allotropes. Some allotropes, particularly those of elements located (in periodic table terms) alongside or near the notional dividing line between metals and nonmetals, exhibit more pronounced metallic, metalloidal or nonmetallic behaviour than others. The existence of such allotropes can complicate the classification of the elements involved.

Tin, for example, has two allotropes: tetragonal &quot;white&quot; β-tin and cubic &quot;grey&quot; α-tin. White tin is a very shiny, ductile and malleable metal. It is the stable form at or above room temperature and has an electrical conductivity of 9.17 × 104 S·cm−1 (~1/6th that of copper). Grey tin usually has the appearance of a grey micro-crystalline powder, and can also be prepared in brittle semi-lustrous crystalline or polycrystalline forms. It is the stable form below 13.2 °C and has an electrical conductivity of between (2–5) × 102 S·cm−1 (~1/250th that of white tin). Grey tin has the same crystalline structure as that of diamond. It behaves as a semiconductor (as if it had a band gap of 0.08 eV), but has the electronic band structure of a semimetal. It has been referred to as either a very poor metal, a metalloid, a nonmetal or a near metalloid.

The diamond allotrope of carbon is clearly nonmetallic, being translucent and having a low electrical conductivity of 10−14 to 10−16 S·cm−1. Graphite has an electrical conductivity of 3 × 104 S·cm−1, a figure more characteristic of a metal. Phosphorus, sulfur, arsenic, selenium, antimony, and bismuth also have less stable allotropes that display different behaviours.

==Abundance, extraction, and cost==
===Abundance===
The table gives crustal abundances of the elements commonly to rarely recognised as metalloids. Some other elements are included for comparison: oxygen and xenon (the most and least abundant elements with stable isotopes); iron and the coinage metals copper, silver, and gold; and rhenium, the least abundant stable metal (aluminium is normally the most abundant metal). Various abundance estimates have been published; these often disagree to some extent.

===Extraction===
The recognised metalloids can be obtained by chemical reduction of either their oxides or their sulfides. Simpler or more complex extraction methods may be employed depending on the starting form and economic factors. Boron is routinely obtained by reducing the trioxide with magnesium: B2O3 + 3 Mg → 2 B + 3MgO; after secondary processing the resulting brown powder has a purity of up to 97%. Boron of higher purity (&gt; 99%) is prepared by heating volatile boron compounds, such as BCl3 or BBr3, either in a hydrogen atmosphere (2 BX3 + 3 H2 → 2 B + 6 HX) or to the point of thermal decomposition. Silicon and germanium are obtained from their oxides by heating the oxide with carbon or hydrogen: SiO2 + C → Si + CO2; GeO2 + 2 H2 → Ge + 2 H2O. Arsenic is isolated from its pyrite (FeAsS) or arsenical pyrite (FeAs2) by heating; alternatively, it can be obtained from its oxide by reduction with carbon: 2 As2O3 + 3 C → 2 As + 3 CO2. Antimony is derived from its sulfide by reduction with iron: Sb2S3 → 2 Sb + 3 FeS. Tellurium is prepared from its oxide by dissolving it in aqueous NaOH, yielding tellurite, then by electrolytic reduction: TeO2 + 2 NaOH → Na2TeO3 + H2O; Na2TeO3 + H2O → Te + 2 NaOH + O2. Another option is reduction of the oxide by roasting with carbon: TeO2 + C → Te + CO2.

Production methods for the elements less frequently recognised as metalloids involve natural processing, electrolytic or chemical reduction, or irradiation. Carbon (as graphite) occurs naturally and is extracted by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite to the surface. Aluminium is extracted by dissolving its oxide Al2O3 in molten cryolite Na3AlF6 and then by high temperature electrolytic reduction. Selenium is produced by roasting the coinage metal selenides X2Se (X = Cu, Ag, Au) with soda ash to give the selenite: X2Se + O2 + Na2CO3 → Na2SeO3 + 2 X + CO2; the selenide is neutralized by sulfuric acid H2SO4 to give selenous acid H2SeO3; this is reduced by bubbling with SO2 to yield elemental selenium. Polonium and astatine are produced in minute quantities by irradiating bismuth.

===Cost===
The recognised metalloids and their closer neighbours mostly cost less than silver; only polonium and astatine are more expensive than gold, on account of their significant radioactivity. As of 5 April 2014, prices for small samples (up to 100 g) of silicon, antimony and tellurium, and graphite, aluminium and selenium, average around one third the cost of silver (US$1.5 per gram or about $45 an ounce). Boron, germanium, and arsenic samples average about three-and-a-half times the cost of silver. Polonium is available for about $100 per microgram. Zalutsky and Pruszynski estimate a similar cost for producing astatine. Prices for the applicable elements traded as commodities tend to range from two to three times cheaper than the sample price (Ge), to nearly three thousand times cheaper (As).
