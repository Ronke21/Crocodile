<text>SEAT S.A. (; ; from Spanish , ) is a Spanish car manufacturer that sells its vehicles under the SEAT and [[Cupra (marque)|Cupra]] brands. Founded on May 9, 1950, it was created as a joint venture between Spain&#x27;s government-owned Instituto Nacional de Industria (INI), which held a majority stake, Spanish private banks, and Fiat. After being listed as an independent automaker for 36 years, the Spanish government sold SEAT to the Volkswagen Group in 1986, and it remains a fully owned subsidiary of the Group.

The headquarters of SEAT S.A. is located in Martorell, near Barcelona, at the company’s industrial complex. Over 468,000 units were produced in 2020 with more than 427,000 cars exported to over 75 countries worldwide.

== History ==
=== Establishment ===
Spain is the world&#x27;s eighth-largest manufacturer of automobiles. Its car market stands among the largest in Europe. This, however, has not always been the case; in the first half of the 20th century, Spain&#x27;s economy was relatively underdeveloped compared to most other Western European countries and had a limited automobile market. In this period, car production was limited, with only a few low-volume local manufacturers catering mainly to the luxury end of the market, of which Hispano-Suiza was the most successful. Spain&#x27;s limited market for mass-produced vehicles was taken over by foreign companies operating through subsidiaries that either imported cars or assembled cars from imported parts, depriving the country of the technological know-how and large investments needed for mass production. The situation greatly deteriorated with the Spanish Civil War from 1936 to 1939. Car demand collapsed not only due to the greatly reduced purchasing power of Spaniards caused by war devastation but also because the multinational subsidiaries either ceased operations or were severely stricken by the war and its aftermath.
The lack of interest shown by the foreign firms in the weakened post-civil war Spanish market opened an opportunity for local interests. SEAT dates its origins back to June 22, 1940, when the Spanish bank &#x27;Banco Urquijo&#x27;, with the support of a group of industrial companies, (Hispano-Suiza, Basconia, Duro-Felguera, S.E. de Construcción Naval, Euskalduna, S.E. de Construcciones Metálicas, Fundiciones
Bolueta, Echevarría, etc.) founded the &#x27;Sociedad Ibérica de Automóviles de Turismo&#x27; (S.I.A.T.) to establish Spain&#x27;s own mass production car maker. The initial Banco Urquijo&#x27;s project aimed at running the S.I.A.T. motor company as a fully private enterprise, but soon after 1941, the interventionist state holding company Instituto Nacional de Industria followed a decision taken by the Franco government on January 3, 1942. The goal for the new national car brand was not to be only another licensee car maker assembling foreign designs and parts in Spain, but of developing the whole manufacturing process from design to assembly within Spain. Because of the country&#x27;s lack of expertise in automotive mass-production development, finding a foreign partner that would contribute technically and with its models in the early years in exchange for cash, shares, bonds, and royalties became the course of action. With the rest of Europe having entered World War II, and Spain itself in ruins from its civil war, the project was delayed but not abandoned due to its strategic importance.
SEAT under its current name was founded on May 9, 1950, under the denomination &#x27;Sociedad Española de Automóviles de Turismo, S.A.&#x27; (S.E.A.T.) by the Instituto Nacional de Industria (INI) with a starting capital of 600 million pesetas – equivalent today of almost 3.6 million euros – in the form of 600,000 shares of 1000 pesetas each, and in a time when the country needed remodeling the fundamental structures in its national economy, just after the end of World War II. The birth of SEAT came almost a year and a half after the Spanish government and six Spanish banks (&#x27;Banco Urquijo&#x27;, &#x27;Banco Español de Crédito (Banesto)&#x27;, &#x27;Banco de Bilbao&#x27;, &#x27;Banco de Vizcaya&#x27;, &#x27;Banco Hispano-Americano&#x27;, and &#x27;Banco Central&#x27;) had signed on October 26, 1948, an alliance contract with the Italian car manufacturer Fiat to form a partnership with a foreign ally to bring to life Spain&#x27;s major car manufacturer. The favoured bidders were Germany&#x27;s Volkswagen and Italy&#x27;s Fiat. Fiat&#x27;s bid won for several reasons, including Fiat&#x27;s prominence in Spain and the fact that the company established the short-lived &#x27;Fiat Hispania&#x27; plant in Guadalajara, which was destroyed in the Spanish Civil War. Fiat&#x27;s collaboration with the French company Simca proved Fiat&#x27;s ability to manage complex international projects. Fiat&#x27;s experience in the semiprotected car market in Italy was seen as the most easily transferable to the one in Spain, both of which had, at the time, customers of low incomes and limited markets for cars, as well as similar road conditions. In Italy, Fiat dominated the market for vehicles under 12 horsepower, which would initially be the main market segment in Spain. The relative economic isolation of World War II damaged Italy and made Fiat interested in opportunities outside Italy, meaning that the negotiations with the Italian manufacturer could prosper more easily in favour of Spanish interests than those from other countries. In 1947, the Banco Urquijo group revived the S.I.A.T. project. In the next year, the talks ended successfully with the signing of a three-part contract, with the understanding that the INI would hold a 51% controlling interest, as well as a ruling act in the new company preserving a focused approach of the enterprise in the &#x27;national interest&#x27;. The Banco Urquijo group, although a minority shareholder, looked forward to assuming a leading role in the future as soon as the company was privatized. Partner carmaker Fiat was offered a 7% share in exchange for its technical assistance. This way, SEAT would not only be able to reinitiate the country&#x27;s economic recovery as the largest employer in the 1960s and &#x27;70s but would also contribute to the industrialisation of a largely rural economy.
Though initial thoughts were of locating in less-developed inland cities such as Valladolid and Burgos, the company decided the plant would be constructed in the duty-free zone area of the Port of Barcelona (Barcelona Zona Franca), which would offer better access to the Mediterranean shipping and the rest of Europe through rail and road connections across the nearby French border. Barcelona was, after all, a city with an industrial history that had built up expertise in complex industrial enterprises since the latter part of the 19th century; it was also the host location of many early historical Spanish carmakers, such as Hispano-Suiza and Elizalde, and subsidiaries of foreign carmakers, such as Ford Motor Ibérica and General Motors Peninsular. Being an enterprise of vital interest for the national economy and an investment opportunity for Fiat&#x27;s expansion plans through the Iberian peninsula, SEAT benefitted from state tariff and tax exemptions and technical assistance from its foreign partner Fiat. The company&#x27;s first president was the industrial and aeronautical engineer, pilot, and photographer José Ortiz-Echagüe Puertas, who came from the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA, where he had held the position of CEO, and who in 1976 was named the Honorary lifetime president of SEAT.

=== Partnership with Fiat ===

The construction works for SEAT&#x27;s Zona Franca plant began in 1950, and the opening day came three years later on June 5, 1953, while in the meantime since 1951, the Spanish marque was starting preparations for setting up almost from scratch an entire supplier industry background. The first car in the marque&#x27;s history to be produced was a SEAT 1400 model that came off the production line on November 13, 1953, with license plate B-87.223. In the following few months, the plant&#x27;s production output and workforce significantly increased together with the implementation of locally made components in the production process to limit imports from one part and from another part to push the development of the almost nonexistent Spanish supplier industry and meet SEAT&#x27;s assigned key role as the national carmaker in restoring the Spanish economy of post–World War II Spain. By 1954, the use of Spanish-made parts had risen to 93% of the total, and the factory was officially opened the next year on May 5, 1955. Nevertheless, the impact on Spanish society could not be seen immediately since the first model launched by SEAT was considered a luxury car, so it was highly priced and still not affordable to the average Spanish consumer. Consequently, SEAT needed a second, more economical model to compete against simpler, inexpensive designs that appeared in the local market, like the Biscúter, which seemed to suit better the unwealthy customers looking for a personal means of transport in a suffering economy.

Until the time SEAT had the technical maturity and expertise to present its first self-developed model, the SEAT 1200 Sport in 1975, in its beginnings, the company had to manufacture either rebadged or restyled models borrowed from the range of its Italian partner Fiat Automobiles or even redeveloped them according to the needs of its range. However, the first example of a SEAT-exclusive derivative would arrive in September 1963 with the launch of the SEAT 800, a car developed in-house by SEAT with no equivalent model in Fiat&#x27;s range based on the SEAT 600 as a stretched version with four doors.
In 1957 SEAT founded the SEAT Training Centre in the greater Zona Franca plant area, an institution covering the training of qualified personnel and serving the needs of the automobile industry in specialized technical human resources. In that same year, the historical SEAT 600 was launched, which proved to be the crucial car that literally motorized Spain, being the first car for many Spanish families and becoming a symbol of the Spanish miracle.

As the annual production growth was hitting one record after another due to the heavy demand, the economies of scale permitted cutting costs and prices, subsequently renewing demand and boosting sales together with profits for SEAT. On June 29, 1964, the brand opened its new headquarters in Madrid, which hosted the firm&#x27;s sole – up to 1972 – general administration offices. SEAT&#x27;s plant manager was only in Barcelona until 1973 when SEAT settled another general director in Catalonia.
In 1967, 14 years after producing cars for the domestic market, SEAT&#x27;s success was signalled by its dominant position in Spain, ahead of its major competitors, i.e. &#x27;FASA-Renault&#x27;, &#x27;Citroën-Hispania&#x27;, Authi, and Barreiros, making SEAT Spain&#x27;s largest automaker in sales numbers and a wholly localized production. In that year, an agreement between Fiat and the Spanish Ministry of Industry was reached to end the restrictions over exporting SEAT cars from Spain, a term of the original licensee contract agreed with Fiat in 1948. In exchange for that, Fiat would increase its holding in the company from 7% to 36%. At the same time, the share held by the government holding agency would be reduced from a controlling 51% to 32%. The six major Spanish banks took the remaining 32%, which decreased from their previous 42% share split equally into 7% parts owned by every single one. Although not a majority owner, Fiat now was seen to control the business: the deal also included various undertakings by Fiat to help in the growth of SEAT, and with the development of a new model (possibly the SEAT 133). On December 6, 1967, SEAT also founded its own customer financing company &#x27;Financiera SEAT, S.A.&#x27; (Fiseat).

To produce its own research projects independently, on November 16, 1970, SEAT came in accordance with Fiat to start building separate infrastructures aimed at developing new technologies. In 1972, the brand arranged some provisional facilities for the site of the future technical centre in Martorell, and in 1973, it began construction work; this goal would come only until 1975 to be reached with the completion of the first phase in the construction of a facility designed by the Catalan architect Josep Antoni Coderch.

During the same period, the manufacturer continued to dominate the Spanish auto market, producing 282,698 cars – more than 58% of the Spanish production total – in 1971, despite the disruption that year caused by strikes and a serious flood at the coastally sited Barcelona plant. However, with just 81 cars per 1000 people, Spanish car sales were seen as ripe for further growth, and SEAT faced the prospect of increased competition with other major manufacturers contemplating the establishment or expansion of local production facilities in the still heavily protected Spanish car market.

In 1973, SEAT and Citroën-Hispania jointly contributed equal shares in founding the Vigo-located factory of Industrias Mecánicas de Galicia, SA (Indugasa) producing constant-velocity joints, essential components used in front-wheel drive cars, &quot;i.e.&quot; in a transmission layout the use of which was becoming more and more common at the time. This plant, which in the next years would supply parts not only to SEAT and Citroën-Hispania but also to Ford España, was meant to be transferred later in 1986 to the multinational company GKN.

In May 1975, after a request from the Spanish state authorities to ensure the rescue of the jobs for the workers in the Authi-owned factories, SEAT moved on talks with the parent company British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC) of the bankrupt Authi to take over the brand&#x27;s operations in Spain, leaving aside GM&#x27;s interest in it, which would otherwise open the path for the American automaker to enter the Spanish market, thus jeopardizing the relationship with Fiat. The talks ended in July 1975, when an agreement was announced between the two parties under which SEAT would acquire from BLMC the Authi brand along with its assets for 1,250 million pesetas. The imposed acquisition of the Landaben plant would also give up SEAT&#x27;s plans to build a new facility in Saragossa. Although the Authi supplier factory in Manresa was transferred to a company called Cometsa for 150 million pesetas, the Landaben plant in Pamplona remained under SEAT&#x27;s ownership to continue production in February 1976 only of SEAT cars this time.

The 1970s were a decade of rising prosperity in Spain, which is reflected in the announcement in August 1976 that SEAT would commence local production of the Lancia Beta. Three years later, Beta production by SEAT indeed commenced at the company&#x27;s recently acquired Pamplona plant, though only the coupe and HPE lift-back versions were included. The Spanish cars were fitted with a simplified suspension system and smaller engines than their Italian counterparts to qualify for a lower car tax rate.

In 1977, SEAT&#x27;s leasing company Liseat was founded. In 1979, the Gearbox del Prat facility was set up as a specialised plant for producing gearboxes, gear mechanisms, and differentials in El Prat del Llobregat near Barcelona.

=== Dispute with Fiat ===

In the early 1980s, extensive discussions concerning funding and control took place between SEAT&#x27;s major shareholder, the Spanish government, and Fiat Automobiles; SEAT needed major capital investment, which Fiat was not prepared to contribute, partially due to the oil crisis of the 1970s and also due to the uncertainty for Fiat&#x27;s interests following the end of a protectionist policy against GM in Spain. The outcome, in 1982, was an end to the relationship with Fiat after nearly 30 years, a rather surprising decision despite the favourable perspectives for the Spanish economy, with Spain being in the anteroom of the European Economic Community since 1977.
The end of the cooperation with the Italian firm was marked by a change in SEAT&#x27;s logo in 1982, and the first car under the new SEAT logo without Fiat&#x27;s involvement appeared in the same year, the SEAT Ronda, styled by Rayton Fissore in collaboration with the technical centre in Martorell. The launch of this model sparked a lawsuit from Fiat against SEAT, as the former claimed the car was too similar to a car in Fiat&#x27;s range, the Ritmo. In defence of SEAT, the then-president of SEAT, Juan Miguel Antoñanzas, showed a Ronda to the press with all the parts different from the Fiat Ritmo painted in bright yellow to highlight the differences. The case was eventually taken to the Arbitration Chamber of Paris, which in 1983 declared that differences between both cars were important enough not to consider the Ronda as a rebadged Ritmo, ending the dispute in favour of SEAT. Rumour at the time had it that Fiat was angry because the Ronda restyling was, in fact, too close to their own planned restyling for the Fiat Ritmo, which they had to scrap.

=== Volkswagen Group subsidiary ===

In 1982, Dr. Carl Horst Hahn, who had just assumed responsibility as the chairman of the Volkswagenwerk AG (Volkswagen Group), examined the opportunity of approaching SEAT after Fiat&#x27;s withdrawal in his plan to expand the Volkswagen Group&#x27;s operations out of Germany and turning the German group into a global force. It also followed the precedent set by other global manufacturers (such as Ford in Valencia and General Motors in Zaragoza) in setting up manufacturing operations in Spain. However, the Spanish authorities had already started talks with other foreign firms, such as Toyota, Nissan and Mitsubishi to choose a strong partner for SEAT. Hahn&#x27;s interest soon resulted in industrial and commercial cooperation, as well as a license agreement with SEAT on September 30, 1982, for the production in Spain of the Volkswagen Passat-Santana and Polo-Derby models in SEAT&#x27;s Zona Franca and Landaben factories, respectively – having thus as an effect on April 29, 1983, the ending of the SEAT Panda&#x27;s production at the Landaben assembly lines due to the need of adapting this plant to the production of the VW Polo – and eventually a partnership agreement was signed on June 16, 1983, between the two parties being represented by the president of SEAT Juan Miguel Antoñanzas and Carl Hahn on behalf of the Volkswagenwerk AG. SEAT also gained the rights to distribute Volkswagens in Spain.

SEAT launched its new Ibiza, a Giugiaro-styled hatchback, which made use of System Porsche engines and also featured underpinnings from the Fiat Ritmo/Strada, in 1984. It also formed the basis of the Málaga, a four-door family saloon. SEAT began expanding into markets beyond Spain&#x27;s borders, including the United Kingdom, where it began selling cars in the autumn of 1985.

On June 18, 1986, after purchasing the 51% majority stake of SEAT and its share increased to 75% on December 23 of the same year, the Volkswagen Group became the major shareholder of SEAT. On December 18, 1990, the Volkswagen Group bought the remaining 25% of the company, thus making SEAT the first non-German wholly-owned subsidiary of the group. Fulfilling Hahn&#x27;s expectations, SEAT not only made a profit two years after Volkswagen bought a majority of its stock but also provided a low-cost manufacturing outlet for other VW models, contributing up to 15.2% of the VW group&#x27;s total output in 1989, as well as an opportunity to enter the relatively unexploited (at that time) Spanish market under the SEAT, VW, and Audi names.

The gathering of the brand&#x27;s main infrastructures in the greater Martorell plant area has taken place in a long process beginning back in 1975 with the opening of the SEAT technical centre, but only in 1989 was a decision made to start building a new main assembly facility next to the technical centre in Martorell, replacing the old one in Zona Franca. In that same year, the translocation of SEAT&#x27;s Madrid administration offices to Barcelona began with the sale of two of the brand&#x27;s assets in La Castellana to be completed in 1991 with the definitive installation of SEAT&#x27;s headquarters in the Catalonia region.
The centralisation of the management, design, research and production facilities localized around the plant site was meant to serve the aim of optimising the development of new models. On February 22, 1993, King Juan Carlos of Spain and the newly elected chairman of the Volkswagen Group Dr. Ferdinand Piëch inaugurated the Martorell plant, one of the most modern and efficient car plants in Europe, using the just-in-time process with its suppliers&#x27; site located only 2.5 km away. The first cars that rolled out of the Martorell plant lines were the SEAT Ibiza Mk2 and its saloon version, the SEAT Córdoba Mk1. The new Ibiza was a huge success for SEAT, greatly expanding its market share, particularly in export markets.

The original planning in October 1993 to close the emblematic Zona Franca assembly plant as soon as the production of vehicles could be transferred to the more efficient Martorell plant was overturned after an arrangement between the Spanish authorities and the Volkswagen Group, according to which the Zona Franca site would continue its operations, but would be gradually turned into a site with an auxiliary role in the production process (foundry, press shop, etc.). Meanwhile, on December 23, 1993, the &#x27;Fábrica Navarra de Automóviles, S.A. was founded as a new company to hold the management of the Landaben factory, separating any ties to SEAT in production matters, with its shares being transferred to Volkswagen in June 1994 over which, however, SEAT would regain ownership four years later in 1998.

In 1994, the design centre in Sitges – the Spanish coastal town south of Barcelona – and the suppliers&#x27; park in Zona Franca were also inaugurated, and in the winter of the same year, SEAT&#x27;s financing and leasing companies – Fiseat and Liseat – were sold to Volkswagen Financial Services AG. In 1994, SEAT, in collaboration with Suzuki, manufactured a five-door prototype model of a city car, internally named Rosé, aiming to replace with it the Marbella in its range, but this model never made it through to production.
The first time a SEAT model was manufactured out of Spain was in 1996, with the production of the SEAT Alhambra Mk1 in the Palmela AutoEuropa plant in Portugal. Also, in January 1997, a non-Spanish descendant, the Belgian Pierre-Alain de Smedt, was appointed SEAT&#x27;s chairman for the first time. The SEAT Arosa, a three-door city hatchback, was launched in 1997, effectively replacing the Marbella, SEAT&#x27;s version of the Fiat Panda, which had been in production since the early 1980s.

On April 7, 1998, the Zona Franca plant marked the end of the production lifecycle of the Marbella model, signalling a historical moment for SEAT with the end of vehicle production in SEAT&#x27;s oldest factory, which opened in 1953; ever since the Zona Franca plant has produced components and parts to be assembled in other locations. It also signalled the demise of SEAT&#x27;s last Fiat-based model.

In March 1999, at the Geneva Motor Show, SEAT presented a modern, stylised logo, more rounded than the last one and using the silver colour on a red background, instead of the previous blue, symbolising respectively the rational and the emotional. This came shortly after the launch of the second-generation Toledo which used it as a badge and shortly before the launch of the Toledo-based Leon hatchback.

The &quot;auto emoción&quot; slogan was presented in September 2000, reflecting the brand&#x27;s new youthful and sporty corporate identity, while SEAT Sport, apart from its motorsport activities, would undertake the responsibility of developing SEAT&#x27;s high-performance vehicles.

On July 1, 2000, Dr. Bernd Peter Pischetsrieder, the former CEO of BMW, was appointed to head SEAT. In the spring of 2002, as Pischetsrieder was commissioned to chair the entire Volkswagen Group, he gave way to his German compatriot Andreas Schleef on March 7, 2002.
From 2002 to 2007, SEAT formed part of the Audi Brand Group, the Volkswagen Group&#x27;s automotive subdivision, consisting of Audi, SEAT and Lamborghini, which was focused on more sporty values, with the marque&#x27;s product vehicles and performance being under the responsibility of the Audi brand.

In 2006, the new SEAT corporate head office was opened in Martorell and the Martorell SEAT Design Centre superseded the Volkswagen Group Design Centre Europe at Sitges, which previously hosted the design facility jointly owned by SEAT, Volkswagen, and Audi, as on February 23 of the same year, an agreement over the transfer of the installations of the latter to the City of Sitges was closed, with the Martorell&#x27;s Design Centre official opening eventually taking place on December 30, 2007.

On January 12, 2007, the inauguration of the building of the SEAT Service Centre next to the southern entrance of the Martorell factory was held, the department focused on technical support, after-sales and marketing purposes, and covering the feedback and the relationship of the brand with the customers and its worldwide network. In January 2007, the operation of the SEAT Prototypes Centre of Development located in the heart of the Martorell industrial complex began, a facility inaugurated on July 16 of the same year, bringing together activities related to the virtual and physical preproduction processes of new models (prototyping, modelling, pilot product development, and series analysis), thus shortening development times for prototypes and preproduction vehicles, as well as saving costs with the use of modern technologies such as virtual simulation.

SEAT entered a clemency program revealing to the Spanish National Commission on Markets and Competition the anti-competitive sharing of sales and repair information among car builders and sellers in Spain controlling 91% of the market between 2006 and 2013.
Thus SEAT and the companies in its group avoided the 2015 sanctions.

In September 2023, it was announced that the SEAT brand would be eliminated on passenger cars by 2030 once the current models reach the end of their respective lifespans as a result of poor sales, with resources shifted to the stronger selling Cupra brand. However, Volkswagen did not completely rule out using the SEAT brand for another automotive role.

== Facilities ==

=== Martorell ===

The headquarters and main manufacturing facilities of the company are located in Martorell, an industrial town approximately 30 km northwest of Barcelona, with an annual production capacity of around 500,000 units. On 22 February 1993, King Juan Carlos of Spain inaugurated this plant, which became the main plant of SEAT and was accompanied by its assembly plant at the coast in Barcelona&#x27;s free port zone (Zona Franca). There is a rail link connecting SEAT&#x27;s Martorell and Zona Franca facilities, which facilitates the transportation of vehicles and parts between the two locations.

The Martorell industrial complex houses numerous facilities, including Cupra Racing (formerly SEAT Sport), SEAT&#x27;s Technical Center, Research and Development Center (R&amp;D), Design Center, Prototypes Centre of Development, SEAT Service Center, which includes the After-Sales Service and Customer Services divisions, as well as the Catalunya Motor dealership, and the Genuine Parts Centre for SEAT, Volkswagen, Audi, and Škoda brands. The factory in Martorell can sometimes assist the former SEAT plant in Pamplona, which is now owned by Volkswagen-Audi-Espana, S.A.

The models produced at Martorell includes: Arona, Formentor, Ibiza, Leon, Leon Sportstourer and Audi A1.

* SEAT Technical Centre, located in Martorell, is focused on R&amp;D. More than 1,294 people work there. In that centre, SEAT fully develops new vehicles. The centre covers a surface area of 200,000m2. They use virtual reality technologies in order to design the “new SEAT” cars.
* SEAT Design Center: it officially opened in 2007 and is located within the SEAT Technical Center. This facility brings the entire design process together. As of 2020, 100 people work there.
* Prototype Development Centre (PDC) was inaugurated in 2007 and is one of SEAT&#x27;s main projects. It consolidates the activities related to the initial phases of the design and development of a new model. It brings together the knowledge, personnel and resources of the Prototype departments of the SEAT Technical Centre and the Pilot Workshop of Process Engineering in Martorell under one roof.
* Spare Parts Centre is an area with 75,000m2 that distributes parts and components to SEAT, Volkswagen, Audi and Škoda dealers in Spain, to SEAT dealers in Portugal and also to SEAT importers all over the world.
* SEAT Service: The After-Sales Service, SEAT Technical Training Centre and Catalunya Motor dealership. This facility covers a surface area of 8,000m2. As of 2020, the workforce is 170 employees.
* Cupra Racing (former SEAT Sport): this facility covers a surface area of 16,000m2 and is close to the manufacturing plant and the SEAT Technical Centre in Martorell. This centre is where SEAT adds sporty finishes to the SEAT range and prepares different competition models, such as the Cupra León Competition or the Cupra e-Racer.

=== Zona Franca ===

SEAT&#x27;s factory in Barcelona&#x27;s Zona Franca started its activities in 1953 and was the production facility where the first SEAT models such as the SEAT 1400 and the 600 were built. In 1993, the car production began to get transferred to the new Martorell plant, and since then, the Barcelona factory has been producing parts such as doors, roofs, fenders and chassis.

80% of the production of the parts for the MQB A0, the compact modular platform of the Volkswagen Group on which the Ibiza and Arona are based, is carried out in these facilities, as well as most of the stamped parts for all other SEAT models. The development and assembly facilities are some of the newest within the Volkswagen Group, with the ability to produce cars not only for its own brand but also for other Volkswagen Group brands, such as Volkswagen and Audi. For example, the development and design of several Audi models (e.g. the Audi A1, the Audi A3 Sportback, the Audi Q5, etc.) and also several Audi development projects took place there.

This plant is an industry benchmark, as it features elements such as the virtual simulation of the PXL press, 3D printing in the maintenance workshop, the automatic shifting between sealing tips of the robots in the body shop, and the automation of the logistics flow through automated guided vehicles.

The Barcelona Zona Franca site includes the SEAT Training Centre, the Zona Franca Press Shop factory, producing stamped body parts, and the Barcelona Gearbox del Prat plant, producing gearboxes not only for SEAT but also for other Volkswagen Group marques (Volkswagen, Audi, and Škoda); the latter plant was awarded the Volkswagen Excellence Award in 2009 by the Volkswagen Group for high-quality production process and product.

=== Other manufacturing plants ===
Another plant owned directly by SEAT from 1975 was the Landaben plant in Pamplona, but in December 1993 its ownership was transferred to the Volkswagen Group subsidiary &quot;Volkswagen-Audi-Espana, S.A.&quot;, and the site today is producing Volkswagen cars in Spain. However, SEAT&#x27;s Martorell site still provides support to Volkswagen&#x27;s operations in the Pamplona plant when necessary, as it did after a serious fire in the paint shop in the Landaben VW plant in April 2007.

Factories of the Volkswagen Group currently producing SEAT models also include the Bratislava site in Slovakia, the Volkswagen Zwickau-Mosel Plant in Zwickau, Germany (where the Cupra Born EV model is produced alongside the Volkswagen ID.3 Electric vehicle); the AutoEuropa factory in Palmela, Portugal, and Wolfsburg in Germany. Since 2016, SEAT also holds a museum in the Zona Franca&#x27;s &#x27;Nave A122&#x27; site, which hosts all production and prototype models ever presented by SEAT together with some special or limited edition vehicles with historical value for the brand and the automotive history of Spain.

Among SEAT&#x27;s subsidiaries, the SEAT Deutschland GmbH subsidiary company is based in Mörfelden-Walldorf, Germany, and apart from its commercial activities, has the further responsibility of operating SEAT&#x27;s electronic platform, the SEAT IT Services Network. In Wolfsburg, Germany, in the middle of a lake inside the Autostadt, the Volkswagen Group&#x27;s corporate theme park, is SEAT&#x27;s thematic pavilion, one of the largest pavilions in the park.

=== Other company facilities ===

* Casa SEAT: is a benchmark urban mobility promotional lab and was inaugurated in June 2020. It is located in Passeig de Gràcia in Barcelona and is SEAT MÓ&#x27;s headquarters.
* SEAT: CODE (Center of Digital Excellence) is the software development centre. Since its establishment in 2019, it has led the company&#x27;s digital transformation and created digital solutions to boost SEAT, Cupra and SEAT MÓ. In July 2020, this centre inaugurated its headquarters in Barcelona.
* SEAT&#x27;s dealers: Besides selling SEAT and Cupra, some also offer second-hand vehicles or KM0 under the company DasWeltAuto, belonging to the Volkswagen Group. Many dealers also offer maintenance, parts, supplies and repair of the models. Outside Spain, SEAT has distributors in more than 70 countries.   
* SEAT Componentes produces gearboxes for SEAT, Volkswagen, Audi and Škoda in its factory in El Prat de Llobregat (Barcelona). It was founded in 1979; the facilities cover more than 150,000 square meters and have a manufacturing capacity of up to 3,500 gearboxes daily, in a complete process that goes from the foundry to assembling and quality control. In 2020 this facility had more than 1,000 employees and produced two different gearbox models: the MQ200 and the new MQ281. Their combined maximum capacity is 800 thousand gearboxes per year.

== Presence in different markets ==

In its more-than-70 year history, it was only during the period from 1953 to 1965 that the firm produced cars exclusively for the domestic Spanish market. In 1965, in a rather symbolic move, the company exported some 150 units of its SEAT 600 model (licensed version of the Fiat 600) destined for Colombia by air freight for the first time, until two years later, in 1967, SEAT reached a deal over the renegotiation of its license contract with Fiat that allowed the Spanish firm to form an international distribution network for its cars and thereafter start its export operations to more than 12 countries, entering the export market in 1969. Until the early 1980s, however, most SEAT exports were sold with Fiat badging. As a response to SEAT&#x27;s bid for independence, Fiat committed themselves to sell 200,000 SEAT-built cars a year from 1981, compared to 120,000 the year before. At the end of 1983, just after SEAT had won its legal battle with Fiat, a quarter of the production went to Egypt and Latin America. In Europe, they were represented in West Germany, Belgium, France, Italy, Austria, and Greece. The UK, Ireland, and various Scandinavian markets were planned to be added in 1984. This was despite the company only being able to export the Ronda, with the Fura to follow. The exponential growth in exports in the &#x27;70s happened under the leadership of Juan Sánchez Cortés and the export director José María García-Courel.

To date, the company has launched its models in more than 70 countries worldwide in accordance with the development policies of the Volkswagen Group, with almost three-quarters of its annual production representing exports for the markets out of Spain. Its core market remains Europe, while the most successful market outside of Europe in sales for SEAT is currently Mexico, where the company has a dealer presence in 27 Mexican states.

In Europe, the brand has been launched in almost 40 countries across the continent. SEAT today also sells its cars in 11 countries in Asia, mostly in the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula, in 16 countries in the Americas, including North America, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America, and finally Africa, mainly in North Africa. Some of its cars have been sold outside Europe, branded as Volkswagens, such as the SEAT Ibiza hatchback, known in South Africa as the Volkswagen Polo Playa, the SEAT Inca panel van as the Volkswagen Caddy, or the SEAT Córdoba, also known as the Volkswagen Polo Classic.

As of 2012, SEAT was planning to expand into the Chinese market, first with Spanish-produced models, followed later in a second phase by the local assembly of SEAT models in China.

SEAT&#x27;s further expansion plans in more markets outside of Europe have yet to be realised. The company was considering a possible launch in the United States in the past, although this move has never been carried out. Rumours also of a SEAT model being sold as a Volkswagen in Canada and the United States to supplement Volkswagen&#x27;s brand lineup there have occasionally circulated, but have always been unsubstantiated, and ultimately proven to be false.
In the past, other market areas where the brand was also present for a short time were Australia and New Zealand (from 1995 to 1999) and South Africa (from June 2006 to the end of 2008). Still, the brand was withdrawn from those markets due to Volkswagen&#x27;s decision citing that current and expected circumstances made the ongoing importation of a niche brand unviable.
SEAT sold cars in the Russian Federation from 2007 to 2015. SEAT was reintroduced to the New Zealand market in 2017. SEAT re-entered the Australian market in 2022, selling vehicles under their performance marque Cupra. SEAT plans to re-launch in the United States and Canada from mid-2024 to early-2027, selling vehicles under their performance marque Cupra.

== Cupra brand ==
In 2018, the previous range-topping Cupra trim was launched as a stand-alone brand, alongside SEAT, and at the same time, SEAT Sport became Cupra Racing. Cupra describes itself as &#x27;an unconventional challenger brand, based on stimulating style and contemporary performance that inspires the world from Barcelona with progressive cars and experiences. Cupra has its corporate headquarters in Martorell, Spain, and a network of specialised points of sale around the world.

== Motorsport ==
SEAT&#x27;s involvement in motorsports began in the 1970s with the brand&#x27;s contribution to the national formula races in Spain, and by the end of the same decade, the start of its involvement in rallies. In 1971, the Special Vehicles department was formed with the mission to enforce the brand&#x27;s participation in rally championships, resulting in 11 titles between 1979 and 1983. The year 1985 was when SEAT Sport was founded as a separate motorsport division, and especially since the Volkswagen Group takeover in 1986, SEAT has been increasing, even more, its presence in the motorsport world, mainly down to VW&#x27;s plan on focusing the SEAT brand as sporty to appeal particularly to the younger generation of drivers. The results of this effort have been SEAT&#x27;s most prestigious titles in FIA championships, three conquests with the SEAT Ibiza Kit-Car in the FIA 2-Litre World Rally Cup (1996, 1997, 1998), and two times with the SEAT León in the FIA World Touring Car Championship (2008, 2009).

=== Rallying ===

SEAT&#x27;s first serious attempt at a World Rally Championship (WRC) was in the 1977 season when SEAT took part with its SEAT 1430/124D Especial 1800 race car, and in its debut rallying event at the Montecarlo Rally, the SEAT team finished in the third and fourth places with the official 1430-1800 cars being driven by Antonio Zanini and Salvador Cañellas. In recent years, the consignment was placed on the small SEAT Ibiza, a 1.6-L, normally aspirated, front-wheel drive car with its roots in the Volkswagen Polo. The Ibiza allowed the company to evolve its rallying experience further and was officially engaged in some European national championships. The years went by until a 2-L version of the Ibiza was homologated as a kit car, and extra wide tracks, larger wheels, brakes, etc., were fitted to it as the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) kit-car regulations allow. With these attributes, the car won the 2-Litre World Rally Cup three times (1996, 1997, 1998), proving its maker had accumulated enough experience, and budget, to move to the top category, the World Rally Car class of rallying cars.
SEAT&#x27;s three conquests of the FIA 2L WRC title, and the sport&#x27;s popularity in Spain, probably convinced Volkswagen Group management to go further and allow the SEAT Sport department a chance to reach its goal in the top-class WRC category. This situation ended in September 2000, when the company&#x27;s German upper management revoked its decision forcing SEAT Sport to retire from the World Rally Championship.

SEAT&#x27;s project to build a WRC-spec car was officially announced during the 1997 San Remo rally. It was in 1998 that the first evolution of the SEAT Córdoba WRC car was presented at the Porto Motor Show and then first enrolled by the company to compete at the highest level of WRC racing. The Córdoba was based on the family saloon of the same name but was, naturally, a WRC class car equipped with an inline-four turbocharged petrol engine, permanent four-wheel drive, and active differentials involved in its transmission. The Córdoba WRC made its debut at the 1998 Rally of Finland, while a further race car development was incarnated on the SEAT Córdoba WRC E2 which was presented at the Barcelona Motor Show in 1999. However, the short wheelbase and high-mounted engine (compared to its rivals) worked against the Córdoba and results were not competitive. Despite hiring ex-WRC champion Didier Auriol, and a new evolution of the car, the SEAT Córdoba WRC E3, SEAT pulled out of international rallying at the end of 2000.

=== Touring cars ===

In 2002, SEAT announced a one-make championship for the new SEAT León Cupra R, the SEAT León Supercopa.

In 2004, SEAT with Ray Mallock Ltd. (RML) entered the British Touring Car Championship, running two SEAT Toledo Cupra for former-BTCC Champion Jason Plato, and 2003 León UK Champion, Rob Huff. In 2005, Huff left to join Chevrolet (run by RML in the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC)), and he was replaced by 2004 Leon Champion James Pickford, and Luke Hines as SEAT expanded to three cars, now run by Northern South. 2006 saw the Toledo replaced by the new León, and Darren Turner joined the team with James Thompson when his WTCC commitments allowed. 2007 was SEAT&#x27;s best year in BTCC, as Plato was locked in a season-long battle with Fabrizio Giovanardi, which came down to the final race of the season, but just missed out on the title.

Since 2005, SEAT has also competed in the World Touring Car Championship, with its first best season being 2007 when a failed water pump robbed Yvan Muller of a certain victory at the final meeting in Macau. SEAT became the first team to run a TDI in the WTCC, and this gave them a dominant 2008 World Touring Car Championship season, with Yvan Muller winning the driver&#x27;s championship. French racing team Oreca cooperates with the WTCC team. SEAT&#x27;s UK team followed suit in the 2008 BTCC. The BTCC team was sponsored by Holiday Inn.

In 2007, SEAT – with the León Mk2 TDI at the Motorsport Arena Oschersleben in Germany – became the first manufacturer to win a round of the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) series in a diesel car, only a month after announcing it will enter the FIA World Touring Car Championship with the León TDI. SEAT&#x27;s success with the León TDI continued and resulted in winning consecutively the 2008 World Touring Car Championship and 2009 World Touring Car Championship both titles (for drivers as well as for manufacturers&#x27;).

In September 2008, SEAT UK announced that it would withdraw from all motor sport activity in the UK at the end of the season. The SEAT Cupra Championship and the SEAT BTCC campaign ended at Brands Hatch on 21 September. BTCC drivers Jason Plato and Darren Turner have been left without drives for 2009. But Plato will drive for Silverline Chevrolet.

At the opening of the 2009 WTCC, SEAT placed 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th in both races in Brazil. At the second meeting of the WTCC (in Mexico), the SEAT team placed 1st, 4th, 6th, 7th and 11th in the first race. In the second race, they placed 1st, 3rd, 7th, and 8th. While SEAT may have withdrawn from the BTCC, they are showing impressive results in the WTCC.
=== Grand tourer cars ===
In 2003, the SEAT Sport division presented at the Barcelona Motor Show first as a concept car and later the final version of the SEAT Cupra GT race car, which was produced in limited series on customer demand addressed to expertised individuals and racing teams willing to take part in race events.

The Cupra GT was chosen as a GT race car from racing teams, like the Sunred Engineering (SunRED) team, making its debut in 2004 in the Spanish GT Championship, and took part in several Grand tourer circuits not only in Spain but also run in tracks abroad like those of Monza and Magny-Cours.

=== Formula ===

In 2002, SEAT announced a one-make championship for the new SEAT León Cupra R, the SEAT León Supercopa.
In 1970 SEAT set up the &#x27;Fórmula Nacional&#x27; series in Spain, a year later to be known as Formula 1430. The single-seater formula cars, which took part driven by young Spanish drivers, were equipped under support from SEAT with engines of the 1430 model and 6700 gearboxes. The first race of the &#x27;Fórmula Nacional&#x27; series took place at the Jarama circuit in Madrid.

== Model range ==
=== SEAT models ===
=== Cupra models ===
== Nomenclature ==
SEAT&#x27;s corporate tradition, as a Volkswagen Group subsidiary, dictates that the nomenclature of its model range be inspired by Spanish culture. Thus, a large number of SEAT&#x27;s production models have been named after places in Spain (e.g. Arosa, Ibiza, Córdoba, León, Toledo, Altea, Alhambra, Málaga, Marbella, Ronda etc.). However, there have been several exceptions: for example, the name for the SEAT Exeo – added to the brand&#x27;s range in 2008 – was influenced by the Latin word &quot;exire&quot; which means &quot;to go beyond&quot;.

Following the marque&#x27;s naming trend with production models, many of SEAT&#x27;s concept cars adopted names inspired by either Hispanic dances (e.g. tango, bolero, salsa), abbreviations related to existing production models (e.g. IBZ for Ibiza, IBE for &quot;Ibiza Eléctrico&quot;, TL for Toledo etc.), or names reminiscent of SEAT&#x27;s historic sporting roots (e.g. Fórmula, Cupra GT).

Moreover, in recent years, special versions of the production models&#x27; specific ranges have been added, such as the &quot;SC&quot; (for SportCoupé edition,) or &quot;ST&quot; (for SportTourer) differentiating the three-door and the estate versions from the standard four- and five-door ones, while the Cupra (for &quot;Cup Racing&quot; edition) and &quot;FR&quot; (for &quot;Fórmula Racing&quot;) has been used for the high-performance models in the range, signalising SEAT&#x27;s positioning as a sport-oriented brand involved in racing.

Historic references can be found with the iconic &quot;Bocanegra&quot; name, meaning &quot;black mouth&quot; in Spanish, which accompanies the Ibiza model and has its origins in the SEAT 1200 Sport, which was the original SEAT Bocanegra due to its black-painted fascia in the front.

== Sub-ranges ==
;&#x27;Ecomotive&#x27; range
Almost every model in SEAT&#x27;s range has an &#x27;Ecomotive&#x27; derivative version, which in comparison to the standard version has a more eco-friendly tuning. Reduction of weight, low-resistance tyres, new aerodynamics, tweaks in the suspension, as well as changes made to the engine&#x27;s electronic management software with an additional implementation of a maintenance-free Diesel Particle Filter (DPF) for the diesel engines, also updates in the gearbox and the gear ratios with a gearshift indicator in the dash panel reminding when it is the proper time to change gears, combined with an engine &#x27;Start/Stop system&#x27; and an &#x27;Energy Recuperation system&#x27; are some of the modifications adopted in the Ecomotive range in order to cut down both fuel consumption and emissions. The result is a range with some of the cleanest models featuring an improvement not only in gas and particles emissions but also in fuel economy, without big compromise in the vehicle&#x27;s dynamic performance or practicality; for example the SEAT Ibiza Ecomotive 1.4 TDI has CO2 emissions coming up at 98 g/km and still it comes even faster from 0 to 100 km/h than the standard version featuring a 5-door body and air-conditioning, while the SEAT León Ecomotive&#x27;s CO2 emissions are among the lowest in its segment too and raise up to 99 g/km.
Up to the present, the Ecomotive range has been renowned on many occasions.
In 2008, the Ibiza Ecomotive has been declared on top of the Verkehrs-Club Deutschland&#x27;s 2008/2009 list in the &quot;environmentally beneficial vehicle&quot; category and in the 10th Eco Tour not only it has won in the small diesel class but also proved to be the overall winner of all categories. In that specific year the SEAT Ibiza Ecomotive was also awarded the &#x27;Ecobest 2008&#x27; award by the Autobest organisation and the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag named it the &#x27;most economic car of its class in the world.
The year 2009 has been the one when once more the Ibiza Ecomotive was nominated for the &#x27;Green Steering wheel&#x27; award in Switzerland, and set two consecutive times a new world record on fuel saving with a single tank, certified by the IPMC (International Police Motor Corporation) : the first when the Austrian Gerhard Plattner drove from Martorell (Spain) to Göttingen (Germany) with an average fuel consumption of 2.9 L/100 km and the second time in his route from Cieszyn (Poland) to Frankfurt (Germany) having achieved the world record in fuel consumption of 2.34 L/100 km (or 100 mpg U.S.) covering a distance of 1,910 km on a single tank.

;&#x27;MultiFuel&#x27; range
The MultiFuel range consists of the introduction of the flexible-fuel vehicle bio-ethanol technology in selected SEAT models – i.e., the SEAT León MultiFuel, the SEAT Altea MultiFuel and the SEAT Altea XL MultiFuel – with the implementation of the 1.6 MPI MultiFuel E85 motor, capable of producing exactly the same horsepower (102 bhp) just like the relevant pure petrol version of the engine.

== Sales ==
Since its beginnings in 1953, more than 16 million SEAT cars have been produced, with the most successful product in the range being the SEAT Ibiza. This model has sold over 4 million units in its four generations up to the present.

In the year 2009, the total annual retail sales number of SEAT cars was 336,683 vehicles, while the annual production of vehicles under the SEAT brand came up to 307,502 units (301,287 made in SEAT&#x27;s Martorell plant and 6,215 in other Volkswagen group&#x27;s factories).

The total production per year of SEAT and Cupra cars manufactured in SEAT/Cupra and other Volkswagen group plants is shown below. not comprising cars of other Volkswagen group brands, produced in SEAT-owned facilities:

== Rebadges ==

Under Volkswagen Group&#x27;s ownership, numerous SEAT models have been rebadged under other brands, either inside the Volkswagen Group&#x27;s portfolio or out of it.

In particular, some examples concerning the rebadges deriving from SEAT models and being carried out under other Volkswagen Group&#x27;s brands, are the SEAT Ibiza Mk2 which has been rebadged under the VW brand as the VW Polo Playa, the SEAT Córdoba Mk1 rebadged as the VW Polo Classic – FAW-VW City-Golf – VW Derby, the SEAT Arosa as the VW Lupo, and the SEAT Inca as the VW Caddy.

Further rebadges have come under non-Volkswagen Group brand ranges. Some notable examples are the SEAT Ibiza Mk1, which has been rebadged as the Nanjing Yuejin Eagle NJ6400-Unique NJ6400-Soyat NJ7150-Soyat Unique NJ1020, and the SEAT Toledo Mk1 as the Chery A11-Fulwin-Fengyun-Windcloud – Chery A15-A168-Amulet-Cowin-Qiyun-Flagcloud – Vortex Corda.

On the other hand, several SEAT models have derived as rebadges coming from other Volkswagen Group&#x27;s brands such as the SEAT Alhambra Mk1 and Mk2 respectively from the VW Sharan Mk1 and Mk2 (the first generation resulting after a joint venture of the Volkswagen Group together with Ford) and the SEAT Exeo from the Audi A4 B7.

== Tuning companies ==

Several tuning companies have produced modified or high-performance versions of various SEAT models,
some significant examples among those being Abt Sportsline, Je Design, APR, MTM, Abarth, Emelba, Podadera Design, etc.

===Slogans===

SEAT currently does not use a slogan. Here are most of the slogans used by SEAT before:
*SEAT, Grupo Volkswagen (19??–????; not quite a slogan but rather signifying Volkswagen Group ownership)
*SEAT, auto emoción (2000–2011)
*SEAT, Enjoyneering (2011–2014)
*SEAT, Technology to Enjoy (2014–2017)
=== Environmental policy ===
;Electric and hybrid technology development
Since the early 1990s, SEAT has developed and presented several prototypes with either full electric or hybrid powertrain, including the SEAT Toledo Mk1 electric model (1992), the SEAT Ibiza Mk2 electric car (1993), the SEAT Inca electric van (1995), the SEAT León Mk2 Twin drive (2009), the SEAT IBE concept (2010) and the SEAT IBX concept SUV (2011) hybrid cars.

;&#x27;SEAT al Sol&#x27; project
The &#x27;SEAT al Sol&#x27; project consists in the integration of use of solar power through a system of photovoltaic panels generating electricity in SEAT&#x27;s factory in Martorell. The project will be carried through in collaboration with GA-Solar from the beginning of 2010, covering a factory area of 320,000m2 with a system of more than 10MW of photovoltaic panels. This installation is expected to produce more than 13millionkWh of electricity annually, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by over 6,200 tonnes of CO2 per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;media.seat.com/en&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

;&#x27;Cenit verde&#x27; project
The Cenit VERDE initiative is a research project backed by the CENIT (the National Strategic Consortia for Technical Research) programme and supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, in which SEAT plays a key role. Aiming at developing technologies, components and infrastructure for hybrid and electrically powered cars in Spain, this programme brings together 16 technology companies (including Siemens, Endesa, Iberdrola, REE, Cegasa, Ficosa, Circuitor, Cobra or Lear) and 16 universities and research establishments under the CTM coordination (Centre Tecnològic in Manresa) and the support of the CDTI (Centre for Industrial Technological Development, an organization pertaining to the Ministry of Science and Innovation).

In January 2010, the Cenit Verde association made its opening meeting at SEAT&#x27;s Technical Centre in Martorell.

As part of its contribution SEAT comes in with its own &#x27;Verde&#x27; pre-project, including the technology implemented in the plug-in hybrid SEAT León Twin drive as well as in the SEAT IBE concept zero-emissions electric vehicle presented in the 2010 Geneva motor show.

;SEAT Autometro project

The &#x27;SEAT Autometro&#x27; project comprises the construction and management of a rail link service between SEAT&#x27;s Martorell complex and the Port of Barcelona, in the aim of transport of vehicles and components. Autometro is the joint-venture company which operates the rail, having Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) local rail company, COMSA Rail Transport and Pecovasa as its shareholders. The company was founded in November 2005, almost five months after an initial agreement was signed between the Catalan government (Generalitat), the Barcelona Port Authority and SEAT. Due to this project, a branch connecting the Martorell plant with the FGC &#x27;Llobregat-Anoia&#x27; main rail line had to be constructed, as well as further adaptations to the transport network and the host infrastructures in the Port of Barcelona, had to be made. The budget for the project comes up to 6.8 million euros, while SEAT, on its part, also assumes the operational transport costs.
The use of this rail link since January 18, 2008, instead of road transport, has helped not only in terms of cost-effectiveness and road safety but also in the reduction of both road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions.Over the whole &#x27;Autometro&#x27; project awards have been given for the best logistics idea at the 2007 International Logistics Fair (SIL) and specifically to SEAT as the 2008 Distinguished loader by the Loaders&#x27; Association of the Port of Barcelona.

<text>Drupal () is a free and open-source web content management system (CMS) written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License. Drupal provides an open-source back-end framework for at least 14% of the top 10,000 websites worldwide and 1.2% of the top 10 million websites—ranging from personal blogs to corporate, political, and government sites. Drupal can also be used for knowledge management and for business collaboration.

, the Drupal community had more than 1.39 million members, including 124,000 users actively contributing, resulting in more than 50,000 free modules that extend and customize Drupal functionality, over 3,000 free themes that change the look and feel of Drupal, and at least 1,400 free distributions that allow users to quickly and easily set up a complex, use-specific Drupal in fewer steps.

The standard release of Drupal, known as Drupal core, contains basic features common to content-management systems. These include user account registration and maintenance, menu management, RSS feeds, taxonomy, page layout customization, and system administration. The Drupal core installation can serve as a simple website, a single- or multi-user blog, an Internet forum, or a community website providing for user-generated content.

Drupal also describes itself as a web application framework. When compared with notable frameworks, Drupal meets most of the generally accepted feature requirements for such web frameworks.

Although Drupal offers a sophisticated API for developers, basic Web-site installation and administration of the framework require no programming skills.

Drupal runs on any computing platform that supports both a web server capable of running PHP and a database to store content and configuration.

In 2023/2024, Drupal received over 250,000 Euros from Germany&#x27;s Sovereign Tech Fund.

==History==

Drupal was originally written by Dries Buytaert as a message board for his friends to communicate in their dorms while working on his Master&#x27;s degree at the University of Antwerp. After graduation, Buytaert moved the site to the public internet and named it Drop.org. Between 2003 and 2008 Dries Buytaert worked towards a PhD degree at Ghent University. 

The name &quot;Drupal&quot; represents an English rendering of the Dutch word &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;drop&quot; (as in a water droplet). The name came from the now-defunct Drop.org, whose code slowly evolved into Drupal. Buytaert wanted to call the site &quot;dorp&quot; (Dutch for &quot;village&quot;) for its community aspects, but mistyped it when checking the domain name and thought the error sounded better.

Drupal became an open source project in 2001. Interest in Drupal got a significant boost in 2003 when it helped build &quot;DeanSpace&quot; for Howard Dean, one of the candidates in the U.S. Democratic Party&#x27;s primary campaign for the 2004 U.S. presidential election. DeanSpace used open-source sharing of Drupal to support a decentralized network of approximately 50 disparate, unofficial pro-Dean websites that allowed users to communicate directly with one another as well as with the campaign. After Dean ended his campaign, members of his Web team continued to pursue their interest in developing a Web platform that could aid political activism by launching CivicSpace Labs in July 2004, &quot;...the first company with full-time employees that was developing and distributing Drupal technology.&quot; Other companies also began to specialize in Drupal development.

By 2013, the Drupal website listed hundreds of vendors that offered Drupal-related services.

, Drupal is developed by a community. From July 2007 to June 2008, the Drupal.org site provided more than 1.4 million downloads of Drupal software, an increase of approximately 125% from the previous year.

 more than 1,180,000 sites use Drupal. These include hundreds of well-known organizations, including corporations, media and publishing companies, governments, non-profits, schools, and individuals. Drupal has won several Packt Open Source CMS Awards and won the Webware 100 three times in a row.

Drupal 6 was released on February 13, 2008, on March 5, 2009, Buytaert announced a code freeze for Drupal 7 for September 1, 2009. Drupal 7 was released on January 5, 2011, with release parties in several countries. After that, maintenance on Drupal 5 stopped, with only Drupal 7 and Drupal 6 maintained.

Drupal 7&#x27;s end-of-life was scheduled for November 2021, but given the impact of COVID-19, and the continuing wide usage, the end of life has been pushed back until November 1, 2023, to be reviewed annually. Drupal 7 end-of-life has been extended once more as of June 2023 and was finally set for January 5, 2025. This was the final extension for Drupal 7.

In October 2022, Drupal released an open source headless CMS accelerator, allowing the front end to be managed outside of the core system.

==Core==
In the Drupal community, &quot;core&quot; refers to the collaboratively built codebase that can be extended through contributory modules and—for versions prior to Drupal 8—is kept outside of the &quot;sites&quot; folder of a Drupal installation. (Starting with version 8, the core is kept in its own &#x27;core&#x27; sub-directory.) Drupal core is the stock element of Drupal. Common Drupal-specific libraries, as well as the bootstrap process, are defined as Drupal core; all other functionality is defined as Drupal modules including the system module itself.

In a Drupal website&#x27;s default configuration, authors can contribute content as either registered or anonymous users (at the discretion of the administrator). This content is accessible to web visitors through a variety of selectable criteria. As of Drupal 8, Drupal has adopted some Symfony libraries into Drupal core.

Core modules also include a hierarchical taxonomy system, which lets developers categorize content or tag with keywords for easier access.

Drupal core includes modules that can be enabled by the administrator to extend the functionality of the core website.

The core Drupal distribution provides a number of features, including:
===Core themes===
Drupal includes core themes, which customize the &quot;look and feel&quot; of Drupal sites, for example, Garland and Bartik.

The Color Module, introduced in Drupal core 5.0, allows administrators to change the color scheme of certain themes via a browser interface.

===Localization===
As of September 2022, Drupal is available in 100 languages including English (the default). Support is included for right-to-left languages such as Arabic, Persian, and Hebrew.

Drupal localization is built on top of gettext, the GNU internationalization and localization (i18n) library.

===Auto-update notification===
Drupal can automatically notify the administrator about new versions of modules, themes, or the Drupal core. It&#x27;s important to update quickly after security updates are released.

Before updating it is highly recommended to take backup of core, modules, theme, files and database. If there is any error shown after update or if the new update is not compatible with a module, then it can be quickly replaced by a backup. There are several backup modules available in Drupal.

On 15 October 2014, an SQL injection vulnerability was announced and update was released. Two weeks later the Drupal security team released an advisory explaining that everyone should act under the assumption that any site not updated within 7 hours of the announcement was compromised by automated attacks. Thus, it can be extremely important to apply these updates quickly and usage of a tool like drush to make this process easier is highly recommended.

===Database abstraction===
Prior to version 7, Drupal had functions that performed tasks related to databases, such as SQL query cleansing, multi-site table name prefixing, and generating proper SQL queries. In particular, Drupal 6 introduced an abstraction layer that allowed programmers to create SQL queries without writing SQL.

Drupal 9 extends the data abstraction layer so that a programmer no longer needs to write SQL queries as text strings. It uses PHP Data Objects to abstract the database. Microsoft has written a database driver for their SQL Server. Drupal 7 supports the file-based SQLite database engine, which is part of the standard PHP distribution.

===Windows development===
With Drupal 9&#x27;s new database abstraction layer, and ability to run on the Windows web server IIS, it is now easier for Windows developers to participate in the Drupal community.

A group on Drupal.org is dedicated to Windows issues.

===Accessibility===
Since the release of Drupal 7, Web accessibility has been constantly improving in the Drupal community. Drupal is a good framework for building sites accessible to people with disabilities, because many of the best practices have been incorporated into Drupal Core.

Drupal 8 saw many improvements from the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 guidelines which support both an accessible authoring environment as well as support for authors to produce more accessible content.

The accessibility team is carrying on the work of identifying and resolving accessibility barriers and raising awareness within the community.

Drupal 8 has good semantic support for rich web applications through WAI-ARIA. There have been many improvements to both the visitor and administrator sides of Drupal, especially:
* Drag and drop functionality
* Improved color contrast and intensity
* Adding skip navigation to core themes
* Adding labels by default for input forms
* Fixing CSS display:none with consistent methods for hiding and exposing text on focus
* Adding support for ARIA Live Regions with Drupal.announce
* Adding a TabbingManager to support better keyboard navigation

The community also added an accessibility gate for core issues in Drupal 8.

==Extending the core==
Drupal core is modular, defining a system of hooks and callbacks, which are accessed internally via an API. This design allows third-party contributed modules and themes to extend or override Drupal&#x27;s default behaviors without changing Drupal core&#x27;s code.

Drupal isolates core files from contributed modules and themes. This increases flexibility and security and allows administrators to cleanly upgrade to new releases without overwriting their site&#x27;s customizations. The Drupal community has the saying, &quot;Never hack core,&quot; a strong recommendation that site developers do not change core files.

===Modules===
Contributed modules offer such additional or alternate features as image galleries, custom content types and content listings, WYSIWYG editors, private messaging, third-party integration tools, integrating with BPM portals, and more. the Drupal website lists more than 44,000 free modules.

Some of the most commonly used contributed modules include:
* Content Construction Kit (CCK): Allows site administrators to dynamically create content types by extending the database schema. &quot;Content type&quot; describes the kind of information. Content types include, but are not limited to, events, invitations, reviews, articles, and products. The CCK Fields API is in Drupal core in Drupal 7.
* Views: Facilitates the retrieval and presentation, through a database abstraction system, of content to site visitors. Basic views functionality has been added to core of Drupal 8.
* Panels: Drag and drop layout manager that allows site administrators to visually design their site.
* Rules: Conditionally executed actions based on recurring events.
* Features: Enables the capture and management of features (entities, views, fields, configuration, etc.) into custom modules.
* Context: Allows the definition of sections of site where Drupal features can be conditionally activated
* Media: Makes photo uploading and media management easier
* Services: Provides an API for Drupal.

===Themes===
, there are more than 2,800 free community-contributed themes. Themes adapt or replace a Drupal site&#x27;s default look and feel.

Drupal themes use standardized formats that may be generated by common third-party theme design engines. Many are written in the PHPTemplate engine or, to a lesser extent, the XTemplate engine. Some templates use hard-coded PHP. Drupal 8 and future versions of Drupal integrate the Twig templating engine.

The inclusion of the PHPTemplate and XTemplate engines in Drupal addressed user concerns about flexibility and complexity. The Drupal theming system utilizes a template engine to further separate HTML/CSS from PHP. A popular Drupal contributed module called &#x27;Devel&#x27; provides GUI information to developers and themers about the page build.

Community-contributed themes on the Drupal website are released under a free GPL license.

===Distributions===
In the past, those wanting a fully customized installation of Drupal had to download a pre-tailored version separately from the official Drupal core. Today, however, a distribution defines a packaged version of Drupal that upon installation, provides a website or application built for a specific purpose.

The distributions offer the benefit of a new Drupal site without having to manually seek out and install third-party contributed modules or adjust configuration settings. They are collections of modules, themes, and associated configuration settings that prepare Drupal for custom operation. For example, a distribution could configure Drupal as a &quot;brochure&quot; site rather than a news site or online store.

==Architecture==
Drupal is based on the Presentation Abstraction Control architecture, or PAC.

The menu system acts as the Controller. It accepts input via a single source (HTTP GET and POST), routes requests to the appropriate helper functions, pulls data out of the Abstraction (nodes and, from Drupal 5 onwards, forms), and then pushes it through a filter to get a Presentation of it (the theme system).

It even has multiple, parallel PAC agents in the form of blocks that push data out to a common canvas (page.tpl.php).

==Community==
Drupal.org has a large community of users and developers who provide active community support by coming up with new updates to help improve the functionality of Drupal. more than 105,400 users are actively contributing. The semiannual DrupalCon conference alternates between North America, Europe and Asia. Attendance at DrupalCon grew from 500 at Szeged in August 2008, to over 3,700 people at Austin, Texas, in June 2014.

Smaller events, known as &quot;Drupal Camps&quot; or DrupalCamp, occur throughout the year all over the world. The annual Florida DrupalCamp brings users together for Coding for a Cause that benefits a local nonprofit organization, as does the annual GLADCamp (Greater Los Angeles Drupal Camp) event, Coders with a Cause.

The Drupal community also organizes professional and semi-professional gatherings called meetups at numerous venues around the world.

There are over 30 national communities around drupal.org offering language-specific support.

===Media===

There are several Drupal specific forms of Media. The most popular is podcasts. DrupalEasy, TalkingDrupal and the Lullabot Podcast all have hundreds of episodes and thousands of regular listeners. 

Recently, The Drop Times has become a Drupal focused media outlet, highlighting stories of relevance to the Drupal community.

==Security==
Drupal&#x27;s policy is to announce the nature of each security vulnerability once the fix is released.

Administrators of Drupal sites can be automatically notified of these new releases via the Update Status module (Drupal 6) or via the Update Manager (Drupal 7).

Drupal maintains a security announcement mailing list, a history of all security advisories, a security team home page, and an RSS feed with the most recent security advisories.

In mid-October 2014, Drupal issued a &quot;highly critical&quot; security advisory regarding an SQL injection bug in Drupal 7, also known as Drupageddon. Downloading and installing an upgrade to Drupal 7.32 fixes the vulnerability, but does not remove any backdoor installed by hackers if the site has already been compromised. Attacks began soon after the vulnerability was announced. According to the Drupal security team, where a site was not patched within hours of the announcement, it should be considered compromised and taken offline by being replaced with a static HTML page while the administrator of its server must be told that other sites on the same server may also have been compromised. To solve the problem, the site must be restored using backups from before October 15, be patched and manually updated, and anything merged from the site must be audited.

In late March 2018, a patch for vulnerability CVE-2018-7600, also dubbed &quot;Drupalgeddon2&quot;, was released. The underlying bug allows remote attackers without special roles or permissions to take complete control of Drupal 6, 7, and 8 sites. Drupal 6 reached end-of-life on February 24, 2016, and does not get official security updates (extended support is available from two paid Long Term Services Vendors). Starting early April, large scale automated attacks against vulnerable sites were observed, and on April 20, a high level of penetration of unpatched sites was reported.

On December 23, 2019, Drupal patched an arbitrary file upload flaw. The file-upload flaw affects Drupal 8.8.x before 8.8.1 and 8.7.x before 8.7.11, and the vulnerability is listed as moderately critical by Drupal.

In September 2022, Drupal announced two security advisories for a severe vulnerability in Twig for users of Drupal 9.3 and 9.4. That week, Drupal also announced a patch for the S3 File System to fix an access bypass issue.

In January 2023, Drupal announced software updates to resolve four vulnerabilities in Drupal core and three plugins.

<doc id="166008" wikidata="Q322666" url="?curid=166008" title="Cramer's rule">
<text>In linear algebra, Cramer&#x27;s rule is an explicit formula for the solution of a system of linear equations with as many equations as unknowns, valid whenever the system has a unique solution. It expresses the solution in terms of the determinants of the (square) coefficient matrix and of matrices obtained from it by replacing one column by the column vector of right-sides of the equations. It is named after Gabriel Cramer, who published the rule for an arbitrary number of unknowns in 1750, although Colin Maclaurin also published special cases of the rule in 1748, and possibly knew of it as early as 1729.

Cramer&#x27;s rule, implemented in a naive way, is computationally inefficient for systems of more than two or three equations. In the case of equations in unknowns, it requires computation of determinants, while Gaussian elimination produces the result with the same (up to a constant factor independent of ) computational complexity as the computation of a single determinant.

==General case==
Consider a system of linear equations for unknowns, represented in matrix multiplication form as follows:

:formula_1

where the matrix has a nonzero determinant, and the vector formula_2 is the column vector of the variables. Then the theorem states that in this case the system has a unique solution, whose individual values for the unknowns are given by:

:formula_3

where formula_4 is the matrix formed by replacing the -th column of by the column vector .

A more general version of Cramer&#x27;s rule considers the matrix equation

:formula_5

where the matrix has a nonzero determinant, and , are matrices. Given sequences formula_6 and formula_7, let formula_8 be the submatrix of with rows in formula_9 and columns in formula_10. Let formula_11 be the matrix formed by replacing the formula_12 column of by the formula_13 column of , for all formula_14. Then

:formula_15

In the case formula_16, this reduces to the normal Cramer&#x27;s rule.

The rule holds for systems of equations with coefficients and unknowns in any field, not just in the real numbers.

==Proof==
The proof for Cramer&#x27;s rule uses the following properties of the determinants: linearity with respect to any given column and the fact that the determinant is zero whenever two columns are equal, which is implied by the property that the sign of the determinant flips if you switch two columns.

Fix the index of a column, and consider that the entries of the other columns have fixed values. This makes the determinant a function of the entries of the th column. Linearity with respect to this column means that this function has the form 
:formula_17
where the formula_18 are coefficients that depend on the entries of that are not in column . So, one has 
:formula_19
(Laplace expansion provides a formula for computing the formula_18 but their expression is not important here.) 

If the function formula_21 is applied to any &quot;other&quot; column of , then the result is the determinant of the matrix obtained from by replacing column by a copy of column , so the resulting determinant is 0 (the case of two equal columns).

Now consider a system of linear equations in unknowns formula_22, whose coefficient matrix is , with det(&quot;A&quot;) assumed to be nonzero:

:formula_23

If one combines these equations by taking times the first equation, plus times the second, and so forth until times the last, then for every the resulting coefficient of becomes
:formula_24
So, all coefficients become zero, except the coefficient of formula_25 that becomes formula_26 Similarly, the constant coefficient becomes formula_27 and the resulting equation is thus
:formula_28
which gives the value of formula_25 as
:formula_30

As, by construction, the numerator is the determinant of the matrix obtained from by replacing column by , we get the expression of Cramer&#x27;s rule as a necessary condition for a solution. 

It remains to prove that these values for the unknowns form a solution. Let be the matrix that has the coefficients of formula_21 as th row, for formula_32 (this is the adjugate matrix for ). Expressed in matrix terms, we have thus to prove that 
:formula_33
is a solution; that is, that 
:formula_34
For that, it suffices to prove that 
:formula_35
where formula_36 is the identity matrix.

The above properties of the functions formula_21 show that one has , and therefore,
:formula_38
This completes the proof, since a left inverse of a square matrix is also a right-inverse (see Invertible matrix theorem).

For other proofs, see below.

==Finding inverse matrix==

Let be an matrix with entries in a field . Then

:formula_39

where denotes the adjugate matrix, is the determinant, and is the identity matrix. If is nonzero, then the inverse matrix of is

:formula_40

This gives a formula for the inverse of , provided . In fact, this formula works whenever is a commutative ring, provided that is a unit. If is not a unit, then is not invertible over the ring (it may be invertible over a larger ring in which some non-unit elements of may be invertible).

==Applications==

===Explicit formulas for small systems===
Consider the linear system

:formula_41

which in matrix format is

:formula_42

Assume is nonzero. Then, with the help of determinants, and can be found with Cramer&#x27;s rule as

:formula_43

The rules for matrices are similar. Given

:formula_44

which in matrix format is

:formula_45

Then the values of and can be found as follows:

:formula_46

===Differential geometry===

====Ricci calculus====
Cramer&#x27;s rule is used in the Ricci calculus in various calculations involving the Christoffel symbols of the first and second kind.

In particular, Cramer&#x27;s rule can be used to prove that the divergence operator on a Riemannian manifold is invariant with respect to change of coordinates. We give a direct proof, suppressing the role of the Christoffel symbols.
Let formula_47 be a Riemannian manifold equipped with local coordinates formula_48. Let formula_49 be a vector field. We use the summation convention throughout.

:Theorem.
:&quot;The &quot;divergence&quot; of formula_50,&quot;
::formula_51
:&quot;is invariant under change of coordinates.&quot;
Let formula_52 be a coordinate transformation with non-singular Jacobian. Then the classical transformation laws imply that formula_53 where formula_54. Similarly, if formula_55, then formula_56. 
Writing this transformation law in terms of matrices yields formula_57, which implies formula_58.

Now one computes
:formula_59
In order to show that this equals 
formula_60,
it is necessary and sufficient to show that 
:formula_61
which is equivalent to
:formula_62
Carrying out the differentiation on the left-hand side, we get:
:formula_63
where formula_64 denotes the matrix obtained from formula_65 by deleting the formula_66th row and formula_67th column.
But Cramer&#x27;s Rule says that 
:formula_68
is the formula_69th entry of the matrix formula_70.
Thus
:formula_71
completing the proof.

====Computing derivatives implicitly====
Consider the two equations formula_72 and formula_73. When &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are independent variables, we can define formula_74 and formula_75

An equation for formula_76 can be found by applying Cramer&#x27;s rule.
First, calculate the first derivatives of &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, and &quot;y&quot;:

:formula_77

Substituting &quot;dx&quot;, &quot;dy&quot; into &quot;dF&quot; and &quot;dG&quot;, we have:

:formula_78

Since &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot; are both independent, the coefficients of &quot;du&quot;, &quot;dv&quot; must be zero. So we can write out equations for the coefficients:

:formula_79

Now, by Cramer&#x27;s rule, we see that:

:formula_80

This is now a formula in terms of two Jacobians:

:formula_81

Similar formulas can be derived for formula_82
===Integer programming===
Cramer&#x27;s rule can be used to prove that an integer programming problem whose constraint matrix is totally unimodular and whose right-hand side is integer, has integer basic solutions. This makes the integer program substantially easier to solve.

===Ordinary differential equations===
Cramer&#x27;s rule is used to derive the general solution to an inhomogeneous linear differential equation by the method of variation of parameters.

==Geometric interpretation==

Cramer&#x27;s rule has a geometric interpretation that can be considered also a proof or simply giving insight about its geometric nature. These geometric arguments work in general and not only in the case of two equations with two unknowns presented here.

Given the system of equations

:formula_83

it can be considered as an equation between vectors

:formula_84

The area of the parallelogram determined by formula_85 and formula_86 is given by the determinant of the system of equations:

:formula_87

In general, when there are more variables and equations, the determinant of vectors of length will give the &quot;volume&quot; of the &quot;parallelepiped&quot; determined by those vectors in the -th dimensional Euclidean space.

Therefore, the area of the parallelogram determined by formula_88 and formula_86 has to be formula_90 times the area of the first one since one of the sides has been multiplied by this factor. Now, this last parallelogram, by Cavalieri&#x27;s principle, has the same area as the parallelogram determined by formula_91 and formula_92

Equating the areas of this last and the second parallelogram gives the equation

:formula_93

from which Cramer&#x27;s rule follows.

==Other proofs==

===A proof by abstract linear algebra ===

This is a restatement of the proof above in abstract language.

Consider the map formula_94 where formula_95 is the matrix formula_50 with formula_97 substituted in the formula_66th column, as in Cramer&#x27;s rule. Because of linearity of determinant in every column, this map is linear. Observe that it sends the formula_66th column of formula_50 to the formula_66th basis vector formula_102 (with 1 in the formula_66th place), because determinant of a matrix with a repeated column is 0. So we have a linear map which agrees with the inverse of formula_50 on the column space; hence it agrees with formula_105 on the span of the column space. Since formula_50 is invertible, the column vectors span all of formula_107, so our map really is the inverse of formula_50. Cramer&#x27;s rule follows.

===A short proof===
A short proof of Cramer&#x27;s rule can be given by noticing that formula_90 is the determinant of the matrix

:formula_110

On the other hand, assuming that our original matrix is invertible, this matrix formula_111 has columns formula_112, where formula_113 is the &quot;n&quot;-th column of the matrix . Recall that the matrix formula_114 has columns formula_115, and therefore formula_116. Hence, by using that the determinant of the product of two matrices is the product of the determinants, we have

:formula_117

The proof for other formula_25 is similar.

===Using Geometric Algebra===
==Inconsistent and indeterminate cases==
A system of equations is said to be inconsistent when there are no solutions and it is called indeterminate when there is more than one solution. For linear equations, an indeterminate system will have infinitely many solutions (if it is over an infinite field), since the solutions can be expressed in terms of one or more parameters that can take arbitrary values.

Cramer&#x27;s rule applies to the case where the coefficient determinant is nonzero. In the 2×2 case, if the coefficient determinant is zero, then the system is inconsistent if the numerator determinants are nonzero, or indeterminate if the numerator determinants are zero.

For 3×3 or higher systems, the only thing one can say when the coefficient determinant equals zero is that if any of the numerator determinants are nonzero, then the system must be inconsistent. However, having all determinants zero does not imply that the system is indeterminate. A simple example where all determinants vanish (equal zero) but the system is still inconsistent is the 3×3 system &quot;x&quot;+&quot;y&quot;+&quot;z&quot;=1, &quot;x&quot;+&quot;y&quot;+&quot;z&quot;=2, &quot;x&quot;+&quot;y&quot;+&quot;z&quot;=3.

<text>The former Borgward car manufacturing company, based in Bremen, Germany, was founded by Carl F. W. Borgward (1890–1963). It produced cars of four brands, which were sold to a diversified international customer base: Borgward, Hansa, Goliath and Lloyd. Borgward&#x27;s Isabella was one of the most popular German premium models in the 1950s, while Lloyd&#x27;s Alexander / Lloyd 600 model offered affordable mobility to many working-class motorists. The group ceased operations in 1961, following controversial insolvency proceedings.

The brand was revived in the 21st century, with the Stuttgart-based Borgward Group AG designing and marketing cars manufactured in China. After struggling to remain solvent, it also filed for bankruptcy in 2022.

==History==
===Origins of the component companies===
The origins of the company go back to 1905 with the establishment in Varel (near Bremen) of Hansa Automobilgesellschaft and the foundation in Bremen itself of NAMAG, maker of the Lloyd car. These two businesses merged in 1914 to form the &quot;Hansa-Lloyd-Werke A.G.&quot; After the war, in the troubled economic situation then confronting Germany, the business failed to prosper and by the late 1920s faced bankruptcy. For Carl Borgward, already the successful creator of the Goliath-Blitzkarren business, the misfortunes of Hansa-Lloyd presented an opportunity to greatly expand the scope of his auto business, and he took control of it.

===Blitzkarren===
The first vehicle Carl Borgward designed was the 1924 &quot;Blitzkarren&quot; (&quot;lightning cart&quot;), a tiny three-wheeled van with , which was successful in the market gap it filled. Traders with a small budget bought it for delivery. The Reichspost ordered many of them for postal service.

===Hansa-Lloyd===
In 1929, Borgward became the director of Hansa-Lloyd AG having been able to merge his Goliath-Werke Borgward &amp; Co. with Hansa-Lloyd. The small Goliath-Blitzkarren had by now evolved into the three-wheeled timber-framed synthetic-leather-bodied 5 or 7 hp Goliath Pionier. Borgward turned his attention to the other businesses and led the development of the Hansa Konsul. In February 1937, there came the new Hansa Borgward 2000 and in 1939 its name was shortened to Borgward 2000. The 2000 model was followed by the Borgward 2300 which remained in production until 1942.

After World War II, in 1946 Carl Borgward used some of the brand names from businesses he had acquired over the years to found three separate companies: Borgward, Goliath and Lloyd. This was intended to increase the quantity of steel allocated to his business at a time of austerity and rationing. For many purposes the companies would be run as a single entity; but in a business operated by a man to whom delegation did not come naturally, the proliferation of legal entities nevertheless added unhelpful layers of complexity through the 1950s and encouraged a broadening of the range which in the end proved financially unsustainable with the sales volumes achievable. In 1949 the company presented the Borgward Hansa 1500.

One of the top engineers at Borgward from 1938 to 1952 was Dipl. Ing. Hubert M. Meingast.

===Isabella and P100===
Production of the Borgward Isabella began in 1954. The Isabella would become Borgward&#x27;s most popular model and remained in production for the life of the company. In 1959 the Borgward P100 was introduced, equipped with pneumatic suspension.

===Sports racers===
Borgward introduced a line of 1500 cc sports racers in the 1950s, with the 16-valve engine from these becoming a successful Formula Two power unit (which was also used by some F1 privateers in 1961).

===Controversial company bankruptcy===
In 1961, the company was forced into liquidation by creditors. Carl Borgward died in July 1963, still insisting the company had been technically solvent. This proved to be true in the sense that after the creditors were paid in full, there was still 4.5 million Marks left over from the business.

Reports of difficulties at Borgward surfaced in an article that appeared in Germany&#x27;s news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; on 14 December 1960. A &quot;Spiegel&quot; article was highlighted by means of a picture of Borgward, cigar in mouth, on the magazine&#x27;s front cover. It was strongly critical of his business approach, and included many of the arguments later advanced to explain or justify the company&#x27;s demise. The widest range of cars from any manufacturer in Germany, produced by three till recently operationally autonomous companies (Borgward, Goliath and Lloyd) was supporting a turnover of only 650 million Marks, placing the overall sales value from the combined Borgward auto businesses only in fifth position among Germany&#x27;s auto-makers. The 70-year-old Carl Borgward&#x27;s &quot;hands-on&quot; insistence on an increasingly manic proliferation of new and modified models featuring adventurous, but under-developed technological innovations (&quot;fast manisch[e] Konstruierwut&quot;) gave rise to components which too often did not work, broke down or fell apart, resulting in massive bills for pre-delivery remediation and/or post delivery warranty work that found their way back to the company.

The December 1960 &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; article was not the only serious public criticism targeting Borgward at this time: suddenly stridently negative (if more succinct) comments also turned up in the mass-market &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper and in television reports. Critical media commentaries also appeared concerning large loans to the Borgward Group provided by the local Landesbank.

It is apparent that the business was confronting cash-flow difficulties at the end of 1960. Capital intensive businesses such as auto manufacturing use their expensive machines and tools most efficiently if they use them constantly at full capacity, but the car market in Europe in the 1950s/60s was more seasonal than today, with sales diminishing in Winter, then peaking in the early summer months: Borgward&#x27;s inventory of unsold cars at the end of 1960 was higher than usual, reflecting ambitious growth plans, most obviously in respect of the United States market The December 1960 &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; article speculated that of the 15,000 Borgward cars ordered by the North American dealers in 1960 (and of the 12,000 delivered to them) 6,000 might have to be taken back following a slump in North American demand. (Borgward was not the only European auto maker hit by a North American slump in demand for imported cars during 1960. In the same year two ships carrying Renault Dauphines were turned back in mid-Atlantic because the docks in New York were overcrowded with unsold Dauphines.)

At the end of December 1960 Borgward approached the bank for a further one million Marks of credit, the loan to be backed by a guarantee from the Bremen regional government which initially the Bremen senators agreed to provide. However, following the flood of critical press comment the senators withdrew their guarantee. They now required Carl Borgward to pledge the company itself to the state in return for the guarantee. After a tense 13-hour meeting widely reported in a still hostile media, Borgward agreed to the senate&#x27;s terms on 4 February 1961, thereby averting the bankruptcy of the business.

The Bremen Senate also insisted on appointing its own nominee as chairman of the company&#x27;s supervisory board. The man they chose was Johannes Semler whom reports generally describe as a &quot;Wirtschaftsprüfer&quot; (public auditor), though this designation, especially once translated into English, does less than full justice to the breadth of Semler&#x27;s career. He had studied law at university and worked initially as a lawyer. The scion of a leading Hamburg political family, in 1945 he had himself been a founding member of the centre-right CSU party, and was a member of the Bundestag between 1950 and 1953. Despite his Hamburg origins, Semler was by this time based in Munich, with a network of contacts in the Bavarian establishment that probably included fellow CSU politician and the future German chancellor, Ludwig Erhard, who in 1948 had succeeded Semler in a top administrative position within the Bizone. The appointment of Johannes Semler as the representative of the Bremen senators to chair the Borgward supervisory board would, in retrospect, contribute to the controversy that followed the Borgward bankruptcy.

On 28 July 1961, Semler, as chairman of the supervisory board, joined the directors of the three companies Borgward, Goliath and Lloyd to instigate proceedings for the establishment of a &quot;Vergleichsverfahren&quot;, which would have provided for a court sanctioned scheme of arrangement enabling the business to continue to trade while at the same time protecting the interests of creditors. Two months later, however, in September 1961, the Borgward and Goliath businesses were declared bankrupt, followed in November by the Lloyd business. Subsequent &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; have suggested that Semler, for reasons of his own, never had any intention of allowing the Borgward auto-businesses to survive.

===Post mortem===
The German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; published a thoughtful piece in 1966, implying that with a little more support, and if the proprietor had been more willing to take advice from his own directors, the Borgward company could have easily overcome its financial problems of 1961. But Carl Borgward was financially naive and reluctant to accept advice: his preferred source of credit had always involved shunning the banks and simply taking extra time to pay his creditors, rejecting advice on the financing of his business from his own finance director. By autumn 1960 he was holding on to unpaid creditor invoices worth more than 100 Million Marks for sheet metal and tyres alone. Given that all the company&#x27;s creditors were eventually paid in full, the liquidation decision appeared nevertheless to have been taken prematurely.

===Production in Argentina===
Borgward Argentina was founded in 1954 as a joint venture of Carl F. Borgward HMBH and IAME (Aeronautics and Mechanical Industries) intended to equip the Rastrojero, a small pickup truck. The engine was manufactured at the plant that Borgward had in the town of Isidro Casanova, Buenos Aires province, at a production rate of 20 units per day with almost 800 employees. The production of Borgward Isabella was carried out in Cordoba city, by using Argentine engines, local components (glass, batteries, tires) and other pieces from Germany. This model production started in 1960 at the booming of Argentina automotive industry development, with a production plan of 500 units for that year.

When the German parent company closed its doors in 1961, the operation happened to have local control, and continued for a short time to complete the total manufacture of 1,050 cars during its short life in Argentine territory.

===Production in Mexico===
As part of the bankruptcy process, in 1963, all manufacturing equipment for the Borgward Isabella and P100 was sold to a buyer in Monterrey, Mexico. Production in Mexico was delayed, but was started in August 1967 by entrepreneur and trucking magnate Gregorio Ramirez Gonzalez. Production in Mexico ceased in 1970.

==Revival==
In 2008, the Borgward Group AG was formed in Lucerne by Christian Borgward (grandson of Carl F. W. Borgward) and Karlheinz L. Knöss. The new company later moved to Stuttgart. With both investment and manufacture by Beiqi Foton Motor (a subsidiary of BAIC, a major Chinese automotive group), the Borgward group had started to sell SUVs by January 2017.

It filed for bankruptcy in Beijing on April 8, 2022.

<text>In continuum mechanics, vorticity is a pseudovector (or axial vector) field that describes the local spinning motion of a continuum near some point (the tendency of something to rotate), as would be seen by an observer located at that point and traveling along with the flow. It is an important quantity in the dynamical theory of fluids and provides a convenient framework for understanding a variety of complex flow phenomena, such as the formation and motion of vortex rings.

Mathematically, the vorticity formula_1 is the curl of the flow velocity formula_2:

:formula_3

where formula_4 is the nabla operator. Conceptually, formula_1 could be determined by marking parts of a continuum in a small neighborhood of the point in question, and watching their &quot;relative&quot; displacements as they move along the flow. The vorticity formula_1 would be twice the mean angular velocity vector of those particles relative to their center of mass, oriented according to the right-hand rule. By its own definition, the vorticity vector is a solenoidal field since formula_7

In a two-dimensional flow, formula_1 is always perpendicular to the plane of the flow, and can therefore be considered a scalar field.

==Mathematical definition and properties==
Mathematically, the vorticity of a three-dimensional flow is a pseudovector field, usually denoted by formula_1, defined as the curl of the velocity field formula_2 describing the continuum motion. In Cartesian coordinates:

:formula_11

We may also express this in index notation as formula_12. In words, the vorticity tells how the velocity vector changes when one moves by an infinitesimal distance in a direction perpendicular to it.

In a two-dimensional flow where the velocity is independent of the formula_13-coordinate and has no formula_13-component, the vorticity vector is always parallel to the formula_13-axis, and therefore can be expressed as a scalar field multiplied by a constant unit vector formula_16:
:formula_17

The vorticity is also related to the flow&#x27;s circulation (line integral of the velocity) along a closed path by the (classical) Stokes&#x27; theorem. Namely, for any infinitesimal surface element with normal direction formula_18 and area formula_19, the circulation formula_20 along the perimeter of formula_21 is the dot product formula_22 where formula_1 is the vorticity at the center of formula_21.

Since vorticity is an axial vector, it can be associated with a second-order antisymmetric tensor formula_25 (the so-called vorticity or rotation tensor), which is said to be the dual of formula_26. The relation between the two quantities, in index notation, are given by

:formula_27

where formula_28 is the three-dimensional Levi-Civita tensor. The vorticity tensor is simply the antisymmetric part of the tensor formula_29, i.e.,

:formula_30

==Examples==
In a mass of continuum that is rotating like a rigid body, the vorticity is twice the angular velocity vector of that rotation. This is the case, for example, in the central core of a Rankine vortex.

The vorticity may be nonzero even when all particles are flowing along straight and parallel pathlines, if there is shear (that is, if the flow speed varies across streamlines). For example, in the laminar flow within a pipe with constant cross section, all particles travel parallel to the axis of the pipe; but faster near that axis, and practically stationary next to the walls. The vorticity will be zero on the axis, and maximum near the walls, where the shear is largest.

Conversely, a flow may have zero vorticity even though its particles travel along curved trajectories. An example is the ideal irrotational vortex, where most particles rotate about some straight axis, with speed inversely proportional to their distances to that axis. A small parcel of continuum that does not straddle the axis will be rotated in one sense but sheared in the opposite sense, in such a way that their mean angular velocity &quot;about their center of mass&quot; is zero.

Another way to visualize vorticity is to imagine that, instantaneously, a tiny part of the continuum becomes solid and the rest of the flow disappears. If that tiny new solid particle is rotating, rather than just moving with the flow, then there is vorticity in the flow. In the figure below, the left subfigure demonstrates no vorticity, and the right subfigure demonstrates existence of vorticity.

== Evolution ==
The evolution of the vorticity field in time is described by the vorticity equation, which can be derived from the Navier–Stokes equations.

In many real flows where the viscosity can be neglected (more precisely, in flows with high Reynolds number), the vorticity field can be modeled by a collection of discrete vortices, the vorticity being negligible everywhere except in small regions of space surrounding the axes of the vortices. This is true in the case of two-dimensional potential flow (i.e. two-dimensional zero viscosity flow), in which case the flowfield can be modeled as a complex-valued field on the complex plane.

Vorticity is useful for understanding how ideal potential flow solutions can be perturbed to model real flows. In general, the presence of viscosity causes a diffusion of vorticity away from the vortex cores into the general flow field; this flow is accounted for by a diffusion term in the vorticity transport equation.

==Vortex lines and vortex tubes==
A vortex line or vorticity line is a line which is everywhere tangent to the local vorticity vector. Vortex lines are defined by the relation

:formula_31

where formula_32 is the vorticity vector in Cartesian coordinates.

A vortex tube is the surface in the continuum formed by all vortex lines passing through a given (reducible) closed curve in the continuum. The &#x27;strength&#x27; of a vortex tube (also called vortex flux) is the integral of the vorticity across a cross-section of the tube, and is the same everywhere along the tube (because vorticity has zero divergence). It is a consequence of Helmholtz&#x27;s theorems (or equivalently, of Kelvin&#x27;s circulation theorem) that in an inviscid fluid the &#x27;strength&#x27; of the vortex tube is also constant with time. Viscous effects introduce frictional losses and time dependence.

In a three-dimensional flow, vorticity (as measured by the volume integral of the square of its magnitude) can be intensified when a vortex line is extended — a phenomenon known as vortex stretching. This phenomenon occurs in the formation of a bathtub vortex in outflowing water, and the build-up of a tornado by rising air currents.

== Vorticity meters ==

=== Rotating-vane vorticity meter ===
A rotating-vane vorticity meter was invented by Russian hydraulic engineer A. Ya. Milovich (1874–1958). In 1913 he proposed a cork with four blades attached as a device qualitatively showing the magnitude of the vertical projection of the vorticity and demonstrated a motion-picture photography of the float&#x27;s motion on the water surface in a model of a river bend.

Rotating-vane vorticity meters are commonly shown in educational films on continuum mechanics (famous examples include the NCFMF&#x27;s &quot;Vorticity&quot; and &quot;Fundamental Principles of Flow&quot; by Iowa Institute of Hydraulic Research).

==Specific sciences==

===Aeronautics===
In aerodynamics, the lift distribution over a finite wing may be approximated by assuming that each spanwise segment of the wing has a semi-infinite trailing vortex behind it. It is then possible to solve for the strength of the vortices using the criterion that there be no flow induced through the surface of the wing. This procedure is called the vortex panel method of computational fluid dynamics. The strengths of the vortices are then summed to find the total approximate circulation about the wing. According to the Kutta–Joukowski theorem, lift per unit of span is the product of circulation, airspeed, and air density.

===Atmospheric sciences===
The relative vorticity is the vorticity relative to the Earth induced by the air velocity field. This air velocity field is often modeled as a two-dimensional flow parallel to the ground, so that the relative vorticity vector is generally scalar rotation quantity perpendicular to the ground. Vorticity is positive when – looking down onto the Earth&#x27;s surface – the wind turns counterclockwise. In the northern hemisphere, positive vorticity is called cyclonic rotation, and negative vorticity is anticyclonic rotation; the nomenclature is reversed in the Southern Hemisphere.

The absolute vorticity is computed from the air velocity relative to an inertial frame, and therefore includes a term due to the Earth&#x27;s rotation, the Coriolis parameter.

The potential vorticity is absolute vorticity divided by the vertical spacing between levels of constant (potential) temperature (or entropy). The absolute vorticity of an air mass will change if the air mass is stretched (or compressed) in the vertical direction, but the potential vorticity is conserved in an adiabatic flow. As adiabatic flow predominates in the atmosphere, the potential vorticity is useful as an approximate tracer of air masses in the atmosphere over the timescale of a few days, particularly when viewed on levels of constant entropy.

The barotropic vorticity equation is the simplest way for forecasting the movement of Rossby waves (that is, the troughs and ridges of 500 hPa geopotential height) over a limited amount of time (a few days). In the 1950s, the first successful programs for numerical weather forecasting utilized that equation.

In modern numerical weather forecasting models and general circulation models (GCMs), vorticity may be one of the predicted variables, in which case the corresponding time-dependent equation is a prognostic equation.

Related to the concept of vorticity is the helicity formula_33, defined as

:formula_34
where the integral is over a given volume formula_35. In atmospheric science, helicity of the air motion is important in forecasting supercells and the potential for tornadic activity.

<text>The 1st Armored Division, nicknamed &quot;Old Ironsides&quot;, is a combined arms division of the United States Army. The division is part of III Armored Corps and operates out of Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. It was the first armored division of the United States Army to see battle in World War II. Since World War II, the division has been involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis, Persian Gulf War, Iraq, Afghanistan, and several other operations. The division has also received numerous awards and recognition.

==Insignia==

The division was nicknamed &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; by its first commander, Major General Bruce Magruder, after he saw a picture of the frigate , also nicknamed &quot;Old Ironsides&quot;. The large &quot;1&quot; at the top represents the numerical designation of the division and the insignia is used as a basis for most of the other sub-unit insignias.

In January 1918, the Tank Corps of the United States Army was established under Colonel Samuel Rockenbach. At his direction, First Lieutenant J. P. Wharton designed the original coat of arms: a triangle on a shield surrounded by a wreath and a silver dragon. The triangle itself is an old heraldic element of armorial design known as a pile, representing the head of a spear. There was no shoulder patch in 1918.

The 7th Cavalry Brigade (mechanized) contributed the other part of the present-day Armor shoulder patch. The brigade formed out of the 1st Cavalry Regiment in Marfa Texas, on 16 January 1933 under General Daniel Van Voorhis, then Colonel of the Cavalry. The 7th Cavalry Brigade included the 13th Cavalry and had been organized specifically to develop the new armored force concept while training in the emerging modern war-fighting tactics.

Colonel George F. Linthwaite (then a newly enlisted Private) joined the 13th Cavalry regiment in 1933. Major General Robert W. Grow (then a Major and brigade adjutant) was instructed to develop a shoulder patch for the new armored force. Grow announced to the brigade that a contest would be held to design the new Armored force patch. A three-day weekend pass was awarded to the designer of the winning entry.

Linthwaite won the contest: he designed a circular patch, four inches in diameters, with a solid yellow-gold background to symbolize the Cavalry heritage. On the face of the patch, he drew a stylized black tank track with a drive and idler sprockets to symbolize mobility. In the center of the track at a slight diagonal, he placed a single cannon barrel, also in black, to symbolize firepower. Finally, to symbolize the striking power of the new armored force, he added a diagonal lightning bolt in red, extending across the total design and full diameter of the patch.

In 1940, Major General Adna R. Chaffee Jr. was promoted to lead the newly created Armor Forces which had evolved from the old 7th Cavalry Brigade and were preparing for the looming war in Europe. Chaffee wanted a patch for this new Armored Force. He chose to combine the 7th Brigade patch with the triangle from the World War I crest. The tri-colors, with blue for infantry, red for artillery, and yellow for cavalry – represented the three basic components of the mechanized armed force. In 1940 the War Department officially designated the now-familiar patch worn by soldiers of all United States Army Armored Divisions.

== World War II ==
On 15 July 1940, the 1st Armored Division, largely an expanded and reorganized version of the 7th Cavalry Brigade, was activated at Fort Knox under the command of Major General Bruce Magruder. The 1st Cavalry Regiment was re-designated as the 1st Armored Regiment and the 13th Cavalry Regiment was re-designated as the 13th Armored Regiment under the 1st Armored Brigade, 1st Armored Division. For more than two years after its activation, the 1st Armored Division trained at Fort Knox and the division pioneered and developed tank gunnery and strategic armored offensives while increasing from 66 medium-sized tanks to over 600 medium and light armored vehicles.

=== Training ===

On 15 July 1940 the division was established at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The U.S. Army had never had an armored division before and the troops necessary for this kind of force were drawn from a variety of army posts.

When the organization was completed, the division had tanks, artillery, and infantry as combat forces. In direct support were tank destroyer, maintenance, medical, supply and engineer battalions, but bringing the division up to its full quota of equipment and vehicles was difficult. Although new equipment was received almost daily, the division had only nine outdated medium tanks primarily armed with guns until March 1941. 
Most of the division attended the Armored Force School at Knox to train in using their newly acquired tanks, half-tracks, and guns.

At Fort Knox, the division participated in the Technicolor short movie &quot;The Tanks Are Coming&quot; (as the &quot;First Armored Force&quot;). It deployed to participate in the VII Corps Maneuvers on 18 August 1941. Once the maneuvers concluded, the 1st Armored Division then moved on 28 August 1941 and arrived at Camp Polk for the Second Army Louisiana Maneuvers on 1 September 1941. They then moved to Fort Jackson on 30 October 1941 to participate in the First Army Carolina Maneuvers.

The division returned to Fort Knox on 7 December 1941 but started to prepare for deployment overseas instead of returning to garrison. Training took on a new intensity. The division was reorganized, and all tanks, both medium and light were put into two armored regiments, the 1st and 13th. A third armored field artillery battalion, the 91st, was formed, and the 701st Tank Destroyer Battalion was organized and attached to the division.

The 1st Armored Division was ordered to Fort Dix on 11 April 1942 to await their deployment overseas. The division&#x27;s port call required them to board the at the New York Port of Embarkation at the Brooklyn Army Terminal on 11 May 1942. They arrived in Northern Ireland on 16 May 1942 and trained on the moors until they moved on to England on 29 October 1942. The division was now commanded by Major General Orlando Ward.

=== Combat operations ===

A volunteer troop of three M3 Lee crews from the 1st Armored Division commanded by Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. fought in the Battle of Gazala under British command in June 1942, becoming the first Americans to engage the Germans on land in the war.

Alerted for the invasion were the 1st Battalion of the 1st Armored Regiment, the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 13th Armored Regiment, nearly all the 6th Armored Infantry Regiment, the 27th Armored Field Artillery Battalion, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; Companies of the 701st Tank Destroyer Battalion, and detachments of the 16th Armored Engineer Battalion, the Supply Battalion, the Maintenance Battalion, 47th Armored Medical Battalion, and the 141st Signal Company.

The unit&#x27;s proper first contact with an enemy was as part of the Allied invasion of Northwest Africa, Operation Torch, on 8 November 1942. Elements of the division became part of the Northern Task Force and became the first American armored division to see combat in World War II. Combat Command B (CCB) of the division landed east and west of Oran under the command of Brigadier General Lunsford E. Oliver and entered the city on 10 November 1942. On 24 November 1942, CCB moved from Tafraoui, Algeria to Bedja, Tunisia, and raided the Djedeida airfield the next day and conquered the city on 28 November 1942. CCB moved southwest of Tebourba on 1 December 1942, engaged with German forces on El Guessa Heights on 3 December 1942, but its lines were pierced on 6 December 1942. CCB withdrew to Bedja with heavy equipment losses between 10 and 11 December 1942 and was placed in reserve. CCB next attacked in the Ousseltia Valley on 21 January 1943, and cleared that area until 29 January 1943 when sent to Bou Chebka, and arrived at Maktar on 14 February 1943.

Combat Command A (CCA) fought at Faïd Pass commencing on 30 January 1943, and advanced to Sidi Bou Zid, where it was pushed back with heavy tank losses on 14 February 1943, and had elements isolated on Djebel Lessouda, Djebel Kasaira, and Garet Hadid. Combat Command C (CCC), which was formed on 23 January 1943 to raid Sened Station on 24 January, advanced towards Sbeita and counterattacked to support CCA in the Sidi Bou Zid area on 15 February 1943, but was forced to retreat with heavy losses. The division withdrew from Sbeita on 16 February 1943, but by 21 February 1943 CCB contained the German attack toward Tébessa. The German withdrawal allowed the division to recover Kasserine Pass on 26 February 1943 and assemble in reserve. The division moved northeast of Gafsa on 13 March 1943 and attacked in heavy rains on 17 March 1943 as CCA took Zannouch, but became immobilized by rain the next day. The division drove on Maknassy on 20 March 1943, and fought the Battle of Djebel Naemia on 22–25 March 1943, and then fought to break through positions barring the road to Gabès between 29 March and 1 April 1943. It followed up on the withdrawing German forces on 6 April 1943 and attacked towards Mateur with CCA on 27 April 1943, which fell after fighting on Hill 315 and Hill 299 on 3 May 1943. The division, now commanded by Major General Ernest N. Harmon, fought the Battle for Djebel Achtel between 5 and 11 May 1943 and entered Ferryville on 7 May 1943. 
With the British forces taking Tunis and Americans in Bizerte, the Axis forces in Tunisia surrendered between 9 and 13 May 1943. The division was reorganized in French Morocco and began arriving in Naples, Italy on 28 October 1943.

After the Allied invasion of Sicily, the 1st Armored Division, which was part of the American Fifth Army, invaded mainland Italy. It participated in the attack on the Winter Line in November 1943, flanked the Axis armies in the landings at Anzio, and passed through the city of Rome and pursued the retreating enemy northward until mid-July 1944. At that point, Harmon was replaced by Major General Vernon Prichard, who led the 1st Armored for the rest of the war. Three days after Prichard took command, the division was reorganized based on experiences in the North Africa Campaign. The change was drastic: it eliminated the armored and infantry regiments in favor of three separate tank and infantry battalions, disbanded the Supply Battalion, and cut the strength of the division from 14,000 to 10,000. The result of the reorganization was a more flexible and balanced division, with roughly equivalent infantry and tank battalions. These forces could be combined or custom-tailored by the command to meet any situation. The additional infantry strength would prove particularly useful in future campaigns in the largely mountainous combat of the Italian campaign. The division continued in combat to the Po Valley until the German forces in Italy surrendered on 2 May 1945. In June, the division moved to Germany as part of the occupation forces.

=== Casualties ===

*Total battle casualties: 7,096
*Killed in action: 1,194
*Wounded in action: 5,168
*Missing in action: 216
*Prisoner of war: 518

During the war, the Old Ironsides division captured 41 towns and cities and 108,740 prisoners. 722 division soldiers were awarded the Silver Star and another 908 received the Bronze Star Medal. The division received 5,478 Purple Hearts. Two division soldiers were awarded the Medal of Honor during World War II: Private Nicholas Minue and Second Lieutenant Thomas Weldon Fowler.

The 1st Armored Division flag returned to the New York Port of Embarkation on 24 April 1946 and was deactivated at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey on 25 April 1946. The component headquarters and units which remained in Germany were retasked and renamed as a component of the United States Constabulary.

== Cold War ==

As part of the Korean War buildup of American forces, the 1st Armored Division was reactivated at Fort Hood, Texas on 7 March 1951. The division became one of the first divisions in the Army to integrate black soldiers throughout the ranks, and was also the only combat-ready armored division in the continental United States and the first to receive the M48 Patton tank.
Training for nuclear war became a major theme in the mid-1950s. The 1st Armored Division participated in tests of the &quot;Atomic Field Army&quot; at Fort Hood and in Operation Sagebrush, the largest joint maneuver conducted since World War II. The 1st Armored Division moved to its new base of operations at Fork Polk, Louisiana after completing the exercise in February 1956.

=== Cuba ===

At the end of the 1950s, the Army&#x27;s focus on a nuclear battlefield waned and it experienced years of reduced budgets. The 1st Armored Division reverted into a training cadre for new inductees after being reduced in size and moved back to Fort Hood.

In 1962, the 1st Armored Division was brought back to full strength and reorganized. Brigades replaced combat commands and the division&#x27;s aviation assets doubled. Intense training followed the reorganization. In October 1962 the 1st Armored Division was declared combat-ready just before the Cuban Missile Crisis. The division deployed from Fort Hood, Texas to Fort Stewart in response to the Soviet stationing of missiles in Cuba. The entire operation took 18 days.

In the following six weeks, the 1st Armored Division conducted live-fire training and amphibious exercises on the Georgia and Florida coasts. One highlight was a visit from President John F. Kennedy on 26 November 1962. Shortly thereafter, tensions eased and the division returned to Ft. Hood.

=== Vietnam ===
Although the 1st Armored Division did not participate as a division in the Vietnam War, there were two units, Company A, 501st Aviation and 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry, that served in Vietnam. Both earned Presidential Unit Citations, and 1-1 Cavalry received two Valorous Unit Awards and three Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry. Neither unit was officially detached from the 1st Armored Division thus veterans of both units may wear the division&#x27;s patch as a combat patch. In 1967 the 198th Infantry Brigade was formed from three of the division&#x27;s infantry battalions and deployed from Fort Hood to Vietnam. After the war, two of the three battalions, 1-6 Infantry and 1-52 Infantry, returned to the 1st Armored Division.

In early April 1968, when rioting broke out in many American cities following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., the 3rd Brigade was deployed on 6 April to assist in restoring order during rioting in Chicago.

=== West Germany ===


In the early 1970s, American forces withdrew from Vietnam and the Army was heavily restructured. the 1st Armored Division was rumored to be on the list of units to be deactivated. Veterans of the division organized a letter-writing campaign to &quot;save&quot; the 1st Armored Division.

As part of the Army&#x27;s post-Vietnam reorganization, the 1st Armored Division was moved to West Germany in 1971 and replaced the 4th Armored Division in the Bavarian city of Ansbach. The Division headquarters remained in Ansbach, with brigade units in the neighboring towns of Bamberg, Illesheim, Fürth (Nuremberg), Schwabach, Katterbach, Crailsheim, Erlangen and Zirndorf for the next twenty years, as part of VII Corps, itself part of NATO&#x27;s Central Army Group.

1st Battalion, 51st Infantry (Mech), at Crailsheim, part of the 1st Brigade, was deactivated on 16 June 1984 as a result of the division&#x27;s conversion to the Division 86 force structure. Under the Division 86 structure, each heavy division decreased by one infantry battalion, while remaining infantry battalions gained one additional rifle company.

On 16 April 1986, the Aviation Brigade, 1st Armored Division, was activated in Germany.

In April 1987, 6th Battalion, 43rd Air Defense Artillery (Patriot) moved to a newly built Urlas Kaserne (located near Bismarck &amp; Katterbach Kaserne) assigned to the 1st Armored Division.

On 16 November 1987, the 501st Combat Aviation Battalion was deactivated and re-flagged as 2nd Battalion, 1st Aviation Regiment at Katterbach Kaserne, Federal Republic of Germany, under the 1st Armored Division.

== Persian Gulf War ==

In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. On 8 November 1990, the 1st Armored Division was alerted for deployment to the Middle East to provide an offensive option should Saddam refuse to withdraw from Kuwait. This alert changed the division&#x27;s focus, from &quot;building down&quot; in Europe to &quot;building up&quot; in Southwest Asia.

Division leaders and soldiers began focusing on planning, training and unit deployment. Planning focused on the challenge of logistics, as the division had to be shipped to Saudi Arabia in a logical order to support the buildup for combat operations.

Commanders and their staff rapidly integrated new equipment into their units to be deployed to the Persian Gulf region. The division also prepared to receive new units: 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division replaced 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division. Round-out units such as the 312th Support Center Rear Area Operations Center (RAOC) composed of Reservists from throughout Germany, also joined the division. Other units, such as the 19th and 54th Engineer Battalions, the 218th Military Police Company, and the 7th Support Group, joined the 1st Armored Division in Kuwait.

Units concentrated on preparing vehicles for overseas movement while undergoing individual and unit training, including gunnery, in the few weeks available before deployment. The division qualified 355 tanks and 300 Bradley crews on Tables VII and VIII, conducted division artillery howitzer section gunnery, fired modified Vulcan Table VIII and qualified Stinger and Chaparral crews. Battle drill rehearsals and wargaming seminars were also part of the rigorous training agenda.

The division transported equipment by rail, wheeled convoy, and rotary-wing self-deployment. These movements unavoidably occurred on short notice or in bad weather, and posed challenges to coordination and logistics. The first trains departed for port the last week of November 1990 and continued to so until the second week of December 1990. Within two months 17,400 soldiers and 7,050 pieces of equipment were moved to Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield/Storm.

=== Battle damage assessment ===

Four division soldiers were killed in action and 52 wounded in action during the Gulf War

== The Balkans ==
On 18 December 1995, under the command of Major General William L. Nash, the division deployed to northeastern Bosnia as the command and major troop contributing element of Task Force Eagle, a peace enforcement, multinational unit. The 1st Armored Division returned in late 1996 to Germany.

In 1999, the unit deployed to Kosovo for Operation Allied Force and Operation Joint Guardian. The unit trained heavily afterwards in the Hohenfels and Grafenwöhr Training Areas in Germany, with realistic OPFOR (Opposition Forces) exercises.

In 2000, the 1st Armored Division&#x27;s 1st Brigade Combat Team trained at the Grafenwoehr Training Area (GTA). In February 2000, 1st Armored Division Headquarters announced the closure of military facilities in Bad Kreuznach and its subsequent move to Wiesbaden scheduled for June 2001. The 1st Armored Division trained at HTA and GTA in three separate exercises in March 2001. Ready First participated in Mountain Guardian III at Hohenfels as a mission rehearsal exercise for Kosovo.

The 1st Armored Division&#x27;s command and control elements conducted a warfighter exercise in the GTA between 21 March and 17 April 2001. The 1st Armored Division took command of Task Force Falcon in Kosovo as Brigadier General Randal Tieszen accepted the colors from 1st Infantry Division&#x27;s Brigadier General Ricardo Sanchez. The 1st Armored Division celebrated its 60th birthday at home and abroad in Kosovo on 15 July 2001. Major General George W. Casey, Jr. traveled to Boston Harbor in August 2001, where he connected with Commander Bill Foster of the historic warship .

== Global War on Terrorism ==
=== Iraq ===

In the months building up to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, two battalions of the 1st Armored Division&#x27;s 3rd Brigade were deployed to support Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 2–70 Armor and 1–41 Infantry battalion task forces augmented the 82nd Airborne Division, the 3rd Infantry Division, and the 101st Airborne Division throughout the campaign to oust Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. These units spearheaded the U.S. assaults in As Samawah and Karbala and later occupied the southern area of Baghdad. The 1st Battalion, 13th Armor followed shortly behind towards the end of March 2003.

In May 2003, the division deployed to Iraq and assumed responsibility for Baghdad, under command of Major General Ricardo Sanchez, relieving the 3d Infantry Division. The 1st Brigade, under Colonel Michael S. Tucker and after July 2003 under Colonel Peter Mansoor, assumed responsibility for the Rusafa and Adhamiya districts of central Baghdad. The division was scheduled to return to Germany in April 2004 but was extended in country an additional 3 months in order to oppose an uprising of Shia militia led by Moqtada Al Sadr. During the extension Task Force 1–37 Armor (&quot;Bandits&quot;) fought Sadr&#x27;s forces in Karbala while Task Force 2–37 AR (&quot;Dukes&quot;) along with elements of 2–3 FA (&quot;Gunners&quot;) fought in Diwaniya, Sadr City, Al-Kut, and Najaf. Task Force 1–36 IN (&quot;Spartans&quot;) became the Combined Joint Task Force 7 Operational Reserve and conducted operations along Route Irish from Baghdad International Airport to the Green Zone in support of the 1st Cavalry Division. Forces from the 2d Brigade fought in Kut. During its 15-month deployment, the division lost 133 soldiers.

==== Ready First ====
The division&#x27;s 1st Brigade deployed again to Iraq in January 2006 under the command of Colonel Sean B. MacFarland after months of intensive training in Grafenwöhr and Hohenfels, Germany. Many of the soldiers who fought with units like 1–36 Infantry (&quot;Spartans&quot;), 2–37 Armor (&quot;Iron Dukes&quot;), and 1–37 (&quot;Bandits&quot;) during the invasion of Iraq returned for a second tour. Most of the 1st BCT was initially deployed to Northern Iraq in Nineveh province concentrating on the city of Tal&#x27; Afar. In May 2006, the main force of the 1st Brigade received orders to move south to the city of Ramadi in volatile Al Anbar Province.

Since 2003, Al Anbar served as a base of operations for the Sunni insurgency and al Qaeda. Ramadi, its capital, had neither a government nor a police force when the brigade arrived. Most military strategists inside and outside of the Bush administration believed that the war in Anbar had already concluded unsuccessfully. Al Qaeda in Iraq publicly announced Ramadi as the capital of their new caliphate and the city alone averaged more than twenty attacks per day; the province was statistically the most dangerous location in the country, and the insurgency enjoyed free rein throughout much of the province.

==== Ramadi ====
When the 1st Brigade arrived in Ramadi in June 2006 with more than 70 M1 Abrams tanks and 84 Bradley fighting vehicles, many locals believed the brigade was preparing for a Fallujah-style block-by-block clearing assault on the city and many insurgents fled the city. Following Colonel H.R. McMaster&#x27;s &quot;Clear, Hold, Build&quot; strategy, the brigade developed a plan to isolate the insurgents, deny them sanctuary, and build Iraqi security forces.

The 1st Brigade moved into some of Ramadi&#x27;s dangerous neighborhoods and built four of what would eventually become eighteen combat outposts starting in July 2006. The soldiers brought the territory under control and inflicted many casualties on the insurgents. On 24 July, the Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) launched a counterattack, initiating 24 assaults, each with about 100 fighters, on American positions. The insurgents failed in all of their attacks and lost about 30 men.

==== Independence Day ====
Simultaneous with combat operations, the brigade worked on the &quot;hold&quot; portion of clear, hold, build. Lieutenant Colonel Tony Deane, commander of Task Force 1-35 Armor, approached Sheik Abdul Sattar Bezia al-Rishawi of the Abu Risha tribe in an attempt to recruit his tribesmen to the police force.

In his book &quot;A Chance in Hell&quot; that focuses on the operation in Al Anbar, Jim Michaels wrote that the US had a flawed view on civil government which ignored the tribal history of Iraq. &quot;The tribal system embraced elements of democracy. The sheik may not be elected,&quot; wrote Michaels,&quot; but nor is he born into his job. Sheiks are generally selected by a group of elders[...] Throughout history, ignoring the tribes [in Iraq] has never been a smart move. Sheiks have wielded power for thousands of years and survived countless efforts to blunt their influence in the name of modernity.&quot;

To facilitate Sheik Sittar, Colonel MacFarland&#x27;s deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Jim Lechner, and his police implementation officer, Marine Major Teddy Gates, changed the location for Iraqi Police recruiting. They wanted a more secure location close to Sattar&#x27;s house, as this would enable them to build a police station north of the Euphrates River in an area where many potential recruits lived. 
Having already had his father and three brothers killed by AQI, Sattar appreciated the idea. The residents&#x27; response was overwhelming by standing in line to serve as IP&#x27;s at the next recruiting drive.

In August, the new Jazeera police station north of the river, manned mostly by Abu Ali Jassim tribe members, was attacked and the sheikh of the tribe was killed. AQI hid the sheikh&#x27;s body so it was not found for several days, a violation of Islam&#x27;s strict burial rules that call for interment within 24 hours.

The attack on the station killed several Iraqi police and created many burn casualties. MacFarland offered to evacuate the police to Camp Blue Diamond, an American Army camp outside of Ramadi, while they repaired the station. But the Iraqis refused to abandon their post and instead put their flag back up and resumed patrolling that same day.

==== Awakening ====
With the locals outraged by AQI&#x27;s disregard of Islamic funeral laws, the charismatic Sattar stepped forward to continue the push toward working with the Americans. On 9 September 2006, he organized a tribal council, attended by more than 50 sheiks as well as MacFarland, where he officially declared an &quot;Anbar Awakening&quot;. It would convene an Awakening Council dedicated to driving the AQI out of Ramadi and establish rule of law and local governance. The Anbar Awakening was realized with Sittar as its leader. McFarland, speaking later about the meeting, said, &quot;I told them that I now knew what it was like to be in Independence Hall on 4 July 1776 when the Declaration of Independence was signed.&quot; 
While attacks remained high through October 2006, the Awakening and Sittar&#x27;s influence began to spread. The AQI, realized it was losing its influence over the citizens and launched a counterattack on the Sufia tribal area on 25 November. The attack was intended to terrorize and insult the Sufia tribe, though with the 1st BCT&#x27;s M1A1 tanks reinforcing tribal defenders, the AQI was repelled and the relationship between the Sufia tribe and the 1st Armored Division improved.

By early 2007, the combination of tribal engagement and combat outposts was defeating AQI&#x27;s in Ramadi and throughout the province. President George W. Bush, in his 23 January 2007 State of the Union speech referred to Al Anbar as a place &quot;where al Qaeda terrorists have gathered and local forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them.&quot;

==== &quot;The Gettysburg of this war&quot; ====
By February 2007, contact with insurgents dropped almost 70 percent in number since June 2006 as well as decreasing in complexity and effect. By the summer of 2007, fighting in Al Anbar was mostly over. Frederick Kagan, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, called Al Anbar &quot;the Gettysburg of this war, to the extent that counterinsurgencies can have such turning points,&quot; writing &quot;Progress in Anbar and throughout the Sunni community has depended heavily on a skillful balance between military force and political efforts at the local level.&quot;

The tactics, techniques, and procedures used by 1st BCT were groundbreaking at the time but came to serve as the philosophical basis for the surge in Iraq. In nine months, 85 soldiers, sailors, and Marines were killed, and over 500 were wounded.

==== Division Headquarters redeploys ====
In September 2007, amid a national debate about troop levels in Iraq and, more broadly, about the US strategy in Iraq, the 1st Armored Division Headquarters was re-deployed to Iraq. General David Petraeus&#x27; surge strategy was in effect, with major counterinsurgency operations across the country. &quot;This is a pivotal and historic time for the 1st AD, for the forces in Iraq and for the nation,&quot; said Brig. Gen. James C. Boozer, a deputy commanding general for 1st AD at the time of the division&#x27;s deployment. The division began its deployment the same day Petraeus delivered his Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq, concluding that &quot;the military objectives of the surge are, in large measure, being met.&quot;

The division, commanded by then-Major General Mark Hertling, conducted a relief in place with the 25th Infantry Division and assumed command of Multi-National Division North, headquartered in Tikrit, Iraq, on 28 October 2007, just as MacFarland&#x27;s Anbar Awakening was pushing AQI out of Anbar. At the time in northern Iraq, enemy attacks averaged 1,800 a month, the Iraqis had little trust in their central government, and the unemployment rate was high.

Hertling assumed responsibility for all Coalition forces in Northern Iraq. Multi-National Division North was composed of five maneuver brigade combat teams, a combat aviation brigade, a fires brigade, and an engineer brigade. The division had responsibility includes the Iraqi provinces of Ninawa, Kirkuk (formerly at Tamin), Salah ad Din, and Diyala along with Dahuk, and As Sulaymaniyah. The area included the critical cities of Tal Afar, Mosul, Bayji, Tikrit, Kirkuk, Samarra, Balad, Baqubah, Dahuk, and Sulaymaniah. Arbil province remained aligned as a separate Multi-National Division, North-East. The division area of operations included ethnic fault lines between Arabs and Kurds, religious fault lines between Sunni and Shia Muslims, numerous tribal regions, and the complexities involving significant former regime elements.

The 1st Armored Division immediately applied a mix of lethal and non-lethal counterinsurgency tactics, as maneuver battalions partnered with State Department officials and provincial reconstruction teams. Commanders applied a focused lethality, protecting the Iraqi population while killing insurgents in large volumes.

The division transferred responsibility to Headquarters 25th Infantry Division on 8 December 2008 and returned to Wiesbaden Army Airfield (later renamed Lucius D. Clay Kaserne) in Germany.

On 17 April 2013, US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced the deployment of elements of the 1st Armored Division headquarters to Jordan in response to the crisis in Syria. The elements from the 1st Armored Division joined forces in Jordan and provided command and control in cooperation with Jordan forces, which was used to establish a joint task force headquarters that provided command and control for chemical weapons response, humanitarian assistance efforts, and stability operations. The 1st Armored Division planners in Jordan are facilitating the exchange of information with the Jordanian Armed Forces.

=== Move to Fort Bliss ===
In 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) commission decided to move the 1st Armored Division to Fort Bliss, Texas no later than 2012. As part of then Army-wide transformation, several division units were deactivated or converted to other units. The 1st Armored Division officially uncased its colors at Fort Bliss on 13 May 2011.

* 1st Brigade: The 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division cased its colors at Friedberg, Germany on 20 April 2007, ending 62 years of military presence in Germany. 1st Brigade reactivated and uncased its colors on 27 October 2008. and began reconfiguring as a Stryker brigade combat team (SBCT) after redeployment from Iraq in November 2010. Denoted 1-1AD &quot;Ready First&quot;, the 1st BCT, 1st Armored Division deployed to Afghanistan in December 2012. The first female engagement team to deploy from Fort Bliss was trained in 2012 before Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta&#x27;s order rescinding restrictions on women in combat roles. &quot;Ready First&quot; Brigade converted from a Stryker BCT to an ABCT 20 June 2019.
* 2nd Brigade: 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division in Baumholder, Germany, remained assigned to USAREUR until 15 July 2009, when it was reflagged as the separate 170th Infantry Brigade. As part of the Grow the Army Plan announced on 19 December 2007, the 170th was one of two infantry brigades to be activated and retained in Germany until 2012 and 2013. (The other brigade is the 172nd Infantry Brigade in Schweinfurt, Germany, which reflagged from 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division on 16 March 2008.) In 2010, the U.S. Army attached the 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division to the Brigade Modernization Command, assigning it the evaluation mission previously held by the 5th Brigade, 1st Armored Division, AETF. In 2016, 2nd Brigade moved to the Ready pool for deployment.
* 3rd Brigade: On 28 March 2008, the 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division (HBCT) deactivated at Fort Riley and reflagged as 2d (Dagger) Brigade, 1st Infantry Division (HBCT). The 3rd Brigade was reactivated as an infantry brigade combat team on 2 July 2009 at Fort Bliss.
* 4th Brigade: On 4 March 2008, 4th Brigade, 1st Armored Division activated at Fort Bliss as a HBCT and reflagged from the 4th Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division.
* 5th Brigade: In 2007, a new unit, 5th Brigade, 1st Armored Division, activated at Fort Bliss as an Army evaluation task force. 5th BCT tested the Future Force Warrior system. It evaluated multiple types of spin out equipment and prepared them for fielding to the rest of the Army. 5th Brigade was deactivated in 2010. 
* Aviation Brigade: The Aviation Brigade, 1st Armored Division deactivated on 7 June 2006 at Fliegerhorst Kaserne, Hanau, Germany and moved to Fort Riley, Kansas to reflag as the modular Combat Aviation Brigade, 1st Infantry Division. The Combat Aviation Brigade, 4th ID was reflagged to CAB, 1st Armored Division. 4–501st Aviation (4th Battalion &quot;Pistoleros&quot;, 501st Regiment, Combat Aviation Brigade, 1st Armored Division) deployed to Kuwait in November 2012.
* Engineer Brigade: The Engineer Brigade, 1st Armored Division, the last of its kind in the Army, cased its colors and inactivated at Giessen, Germany on 26 April 2007.
* Division Artillery: Division Artillery, 1st Armored Division cased its colors and was deactivated at Baumholder, Germany on 1 May 2007. The 1st AD DIVARTY was the last standing division artillery unit in the Army. The DIVARTY reactivated in 2014 at Fort Bliss.

The division&#x27;s colors were officially moved from Germany to Fort Bliss on 13 May 2011. On 25 June 2013, Army force restructuring plans were announced. As part of the plan, the division deactivated its 3rd Brigade Combat Team following its 2014 deployment to Afghanistan. The 4th BCT was reflagged as the 3rd Brigade Combat team in April 2015.

The 1st Armored Division&#x27;s Sustainment Brigade deployed 200 of its soldiers to Afghanistan on 11 May 2015.

=== Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel ===
In late December 2016, about 1,500 soldiers from the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel. In March 2017, 200 soldiers from the 1st Sustainment Brigade deployed throughout Afghanistan to lead logistical operations in support of the US counter-terrorism mission and Afghan-led operations against the Taliban.

=== Operation Inherent Resolve ===
400 soldiers from the division&#x27;s headquarters element deployed to Iraq in summer 2017, where it led the coalition&#x27;s ground efforts as part of Operation Inherent Resolve.

== Organization ==


The division&#x27;s 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team was inactivated after leaving Afghanistan in spring 2015, and its maneuver battalions were reassigned to the remaining three brigade combat teams; subsequently the division&#x27;s 4th Armored Brigade Combat Team was re-flagged as 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team. The 1st Stryker “Ready First” Brigade converted to an armored BCT in summer of 2019, exchanging its 300+ Strykers for Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles. 

Today it is truly an all armored division, true to its namesake. The division consists of a division headquarters battalion, three armored brigade combat teams, a division artillery, a combat aviation brigade, and a sustainment brigade.

<text>In 1908, the International Ice Hockey Federation, an international organization that still runs most of the international hockey tournaments today, was established. In Slovakia (as a part of former Czechoslovakia), Canadian-styled ice hockey was popularized during the European Championships in High Tatras in 1925.

In 1929 the first official tournament took place in Slovakia. The Tatra Cup is the second-oldest ice hockey tournament in Europe, after the Spengler Cup in Switzerland. The first organization of Slovak ice hockey was established under the name of Slovenská župa kanadského ľadového hokeja as a part of the Slovak Ice Hockey Federation in what was then Czechoslovakia.

The first organized competition was held in 1930.

Throughout the course of ice hockey history in Czechoslovakia, many Slovak players became eligible to play for the Czechoslovak national team. Among those who were able to achieve this was Ladislav Troják; A native of Košice who left for Prague in 1934 to play for the LTC Praha, which was at those times considered to be the best ice hockey team in the country. From there, he was only a step away from playing for the national team.

Czechoslovakia and its successor states are rated as being among the leading nations on the international scene, thanks to their triumphs in the Winter Olympic Games and the World Championships.

However, the Slovak national team had to face a difficult challenge in 1993 after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. According to the IIHF regulations, it had to compete with countries with little or no ice hockey tradition at all to prove being worthy to compete at the highest level. Within only a few years of independent existence as a young nation, it would mark its biggest triumph ever by winning the world championships in Sweden in 2002.

As of July 2017, a total of 76 outfield players and four goaltenders with Slovak citizenship have played at least one game in the National Hockey League. The players in the following list have the most scorer points in the NHL.

<doc id="166017" wikidata="Q37153" url="?curid=166017" title="Avocado">
<text>The avocado, alligator pear or avocado pear (Persea americana) is an evergreen tree in the laurel family (Lauraceae). It is native to the Americas and was first domesticated in Mesoamerica more than 5,000 years ago. It was prized for its large and unusually oily fruit. The tree likely originated in the highlands bridging south-central Mexico and Guatemala. Avocado trees have a native growth range from Mexico to Costa Rica. 

Its fruit, sometimes also referred to as an alligator pear or avocado pear, is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed. Sequencing of its genome showed that the evolution of avocados was shaped by polyploidy events and that commercial varieties have a hybrid origin. Avocado trees are partly self-pollinating, and are often propagated through grafting to maintain consistent fruit output. Avocados are presently cultivated in the tropical and Mediterranean climates of many countries. , Mexico is the world&#x27;s leading producer of avocados, supplying 29% of the global harvest of 10.5 million tonnes.

The fruit of domestic varieties have smooth, buttery, golden-green flesh when ripe. Depending on the cultivar, avocados have green, brown, purplish, or black skin, and may be pear-shaped, egg-shaped, or spherical. For commercial purposes, the fruits are picked while unripe and ripened after harvesting. The nutrient density and high fat content of avocado flesh are advantages for various cuisines, including vegetarian diets.

In major production regions like Chile, Mexico and California, the water demands of avocado farms place strain on local resources. Avocado production is implicated in other externalities, including deforestation and human rights concerns associated with the partial control of their production in Mexico by organized crime. Global warming is expected to result in significant changes to the suitable growing zones for avocados, and place additional pressures on the locales in which they are produced due to heat waves and drought.

== Description ==
&quot;Persea americana&quot; is a tree that grows to with a trunk diameter between . The leaves are long and alternately arranged.

=== Flower ===
Panicles of flowers with deciduous bracts arise from new growth or the axils of leaves. The tree flowers thousands of blossoms every year. Avocado blossoms sprout from racemes near the leaf axils; they are small and inconspicuous wide. They have no petals but instead two whorls of three pale-green or greenish-yellow downy perianth lobes, each blossom has 9 stamens with 2 basal orange nectar glands.


=== Fruit ===
The avocado fruit is a climacteric, single-seeded berry, due to the imperceptible endocarp covering the seed, rather than a drupe. The pear-shaped fruit is usually long, weighs between , and has a large central seed, long. Early wild avocados prior to domestication had much smaller seeds around in diameter, likely corresponding to smaller fruit size.

The species produces various cultivars with larger, fleshier fruits with a thinner exocarp because of selective breeding by humans.

== Taxonomy and evolution ==
The species was scientifically named by the British botanist Philip Miller in 1768. The genus &quot;Persea&quot; to which the avocado belongs is considered to have a North American origin, with &quot;Persea&quot; suggested to have diversified in Central America during the Pleistocene epoch. The modern avocado is thought to have speciated from other &quot;Persea&quot; during the Pleistocene, estimated at around either 1.3 million or 430,000 years ago. A number of authors, including Connie Barlow in her 2001 book &quot;The Ghosts of Evolution&quot;, have speculated that the avocado is an &quot;evolutionary anachronism&quot; with megafaunal dispersal syndrome (a concept originally proposed in the 1980s by Paul S. Martin and Daniel H. Janzen), arguing that the avocado likely coevolved dispersal of its large seed by now-extinct megafauna. Barlow proposed that the dispersers included the gomphothere (elephant relative) &quot;Cuvieronius&quot;, as well as ground sloths, toxodontids, and glyptodonts. The concept of evolutionary anachronisms/megafaunal dispersal syndrome has been criticised by some authors, who note that many large fruit are readily dispersed by non-megafaunal animals, with it being noted that living agoutis disperse avocado seeds, with spectacled bears have also having been observed eating domestic avocados.

== History ==
The earliest known written account of the avocado in Europe is that of Martín Fernández de Enciso (1528) in 1519 in his book, &quot;Suma De Geographia Que Trata De Todas Las Partidas Y Provincias Del Mundo&quot;, while describing the native settlement of Yaharo (present-day Dibulla, Colombia). The first detailed account that unequivocally describes the avocado was given by Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés in his work &quot;Sumario de la natural historia de las Indias&quot; in 1526, while holding administrative Spanish colonial duties in Santo Domingo and visiting Castilla de Oro. The first written record in English of the use of the word &#x27;avocado&#x27; was by Hans Sloane, who coined the term, in a 1696 index of Jamaican plants. 

=== Etymology ===
The word &quot;avocado&quot; comes from the Spanish , which derives from the Nahuatl (Mexican) word , which goes back to the proto-Aztecan . In Molina&#x27;s Nahuatl dictionary &quot;auacatl&quot; is given also as the translation for &quot;compañón&quot; &quot;testicle&quot;, and this has been taken up in popular culture where a frequent claim is that testicle was the word&#x27;s original meaning. This is not the case, as the original meaning can be reconstructed as &quot;avocado&quot; – rather the word seems to have been used in Nahuatl as a euphemism for &quot;testicle&quot;.

The modern English name comes from a rendering of the Spanish as . The earliest known written use in English is attested from 1697 as &quot;avogato pear&quot;, later &quot;avocado pear&quot; (due to its shape), a term sometimes corrupted to &quot;alligator pear&quot;.

==== Regional names ====
In Central American, Caribbean Spanish-speaking countries, and Spain it is known by the Mexican Spanish name , while South American Spanish-speaking countries Argentina, Chile, Perú and Uruguay use a Quechua-derived word, . In Portuguese, it is . The Nahuatl can be compounded with other words, as in , meaning avocado soup or sauce, from which the Spanish word derives.

In the United Kingdom the term &quot;avocado pear&quot;, applied when avocados first became commonly available in the 1960s, is sometimes used.

Originating as a diminutive in Australian English, a clipped form, &quot;&quot;, has since become a common colloquialism in South Africa and the United Kingdom.

It is known as &quot;butter fruit&quot; in parts of India and Hong Kong.

== Cultivation ==

=== History ===
Domestication, leading to genetically distinct cultivars, possibly originated in the Tehuacan Valley in the state of Puebla, Mexico. There is evidence for three possible separate domestications of the avocado, resulting in the currently recognized Guatemalan (&quot;quilaoacatl&quot;), Mexican (&quot;aoacatl&quot;) and West Indian (&quot;tlacacolaocatl&quot;) landraces. The Guatemalan and Mexican and landraces originated in the highlands of those countries, while the West Indian landrace is a lowland variety that ranges from Guatemala, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador to Peru, achieving a wide range through human agency before the arrival of the Europeans. The three separate landraces were most likely to have already intermingled in pre-Columbian America and were described in the Florentine Codex. As a result of artificial selection, the fruit and correspondingly the seeds of cultivated avocados became considerably larger relative to their earlier wild forebears millennia before the Columbian exchange.

The earliest residents of northern coastal Peru were living in temporary camps in an ancient wetland and eating avocados, along with chilies, mollusks, sharks, birds, and sea lions. The oldest discovery of an avocado pit comes from Coxcatlan Cave, dating from around 9,000 to 10,000 years ago. Other caves in the Tehuacan Valley from around the same time period also show early evidence for the presence and consumption of avocado. There is evidence for avocado use at Norte Chico civilization sites in Peru by at least 3,200 years ago and at Caballo Muerto in Peru from around 3,800 to 4,500 years ago.
The avocado tree also has a long history of cultivation in Central and South America, likely beginning as early as 5,000 BC. A water jar shaped like an avocado, dating to AD 900, was discovered in the pre-Inca city of Chan Chan.

The plant was introduced to Spain in 1601, Indonesia around 1750, Mauritius in 1780, Brazil in 1809, the United States mainland in 1825, South Africa and Australia in the late 19th century, and the Ottoman Empire in 1908. In the United States, the avocado was introduced to Florida and Hawaii in 1833 and in California in 1856.

The name &quot;avocado&quot; has been used in English since at least 1764, with minor spelling variants such as &quot;avogato&quot; attested even earlier. The avocado was commonly referred to in California as &quot;ahuacate&quot; and in Florida as &quot;alligator pear&quot; until 1915, when the California Avocado Association popularized the term &quot;avocado.&quot;

=== Requirements ===
As a subtropical species, avocados need a climate without frost and with little wind. High winds reduce the humidity, dehydrate the flowers, and affect pollination. When even a mild frost occurs, premature fruit drop may occur; although the &#x27;Hass&#x27; cultivar can tolerate temperatures down to −1 °C. Several cold-hardy varieties are planted in the region of Gainesville, Florida, which survive temperatures as low as with only minor leaf damage. The trees also need well-aerated soils, ideally more than 1 m deep. However, Guatemalan varieties such as &quot;MacArthur&quot;, &quot;Rincon&quot;, or &quot;Nabal&quot; can withstand temperatures down to .

According to information published by the Water Footprint Network, it takes an average of approximately of applied fresh ground or surface water, not including rainfall or natural moisture in the soil, to grow one avocado (). However, the amount of water needed depends on where it is grown; for example, in the main avocado-growing region of Chile, about of applied water are needed to grow one avocado ().

Increasing demand and production of avocados may cause water shortages in some avocado production areas, such as the Mexican state of Michoacán. Avocados may also cause environmental and socioeconomic impacts in major production areas, illegal deforestation, and water disputes. Water requirements for growing avocados are three times higher than for apples, and 18 times higher than for tomatoes.

=== Harvest and postharvest ===
Commercial orchards produce an average of seven tonnes per hectare each year, with some orchards achieving 20 tonnes per hectare. Biennial bearing can be a problem, with heavy crops in one year being followed by poor yields the next.

Like the banana, the avocado is a climacteric fruit, which matures on the tree, but ripens off the tree. Avocados used in commerce are picked hard and green and kept in coolers at until they reach their final destination. Avocados must be mature to ripen properly. Avocados that fall off the tree ripen on the ground. Generally, the fruit is picked once it reaches maturity; Mexican growers pick &#x27;Hass&#x27; avocados when they have more than 23% dry matter, and other producing countries have similar standards. Once picked, avocados ripen in one to two weeks (depending on the cultivar) at room temperature (faster if stored with other fruits such as apples or bananas, because of the influence of ethylene gas). Some supermarkets sell ripened avocados which have been treated with synthetic ethylene to hasten ripening. The use of an ethylene gas &quot;ripening room&quot;, which is now an industry standard, was pioneered in the 1980s by farmer Gil Henry of Escondido, California, in response to footage from a hidden supermarket camera which showed shoppers repeatedly squeezing hard, unripe avocados, putting them &quot;back in the bin&quot;, and moving on without making a purchase. In some cases, avocados can be left on the tree for several months, which is an advantage to commercial growers who seek the greatest return for their crop, but if the fruit remains unpicked for too long, it falls to the ground.

===Breeding===
The species is only partially able to self-pollinate because of dichogamy in its flowering. This limitation, added to the long juvenile period, makes the species difficult to breed. Most cultivars are propagated by grafting, having originated from random seedling plants or minor mutations derived from cultivars. Modern breeding programs tend to use isolation plots where the chances of cross-pollination are reduced. That is the case for programs at the University of California, Riverside, as well as the Volcani Centre and the Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias in Chile.

The avocado is unusual in that the timing of the male and female flower phases differs among cultivars. The two flowering types are A and B. A-cultivar flowers open as female on the morning of the first day and close in late morning or early afternoon. Then they open as male in the afternoon of the second day. B varieties open as female on the afternoon of the first day, close in late afternoon and reopen as male the following morning.
* A cultivars: &#x27;Hass&#x27;, &#x27;Gwen&#x27;, &#x27;Lamb Hass&#x27;, &#x27;Pinkerton&#x27;, &#x27;Reed&#x27;
* B cultivars: &#x27;Fuerte&#x27;, &#x27;Sharwil&#x27;, &#x27;Zutano&#x27;, &#x27;Bacon&#x27;, &#x27;Ettinger&#x27;, &#x27;Sir Prize&#x27;, &#x27;Walter Hole&#x27;

Certain cultivars, such as the &#x27;Hass&#x27;, have a tendency to bear well only in alternate years. After a season with a low yield, due to factors such as cold (which the avocado does not tolerate well), the trees tend to produce abundantly the next season. In addition, due to environmental circumstances during some years, seedless avocados may appear on the trees. Known in the avocado industry as &quot;cukes&quot;, they are usually discarded commercially due to their small size.

===Propagation and rootstocks===

Avocados can be propagated by seed, taking roughly four to six years to bear fruit, although in some cases seedlings can take 10 years to come into bearing. The offspring is unlikely to be identical to the parent cultivar in fruit quality. Prime quality varieties are therefore propagated by grafting to rootstocks that are propagated by seed (seedling rootstocks) or by layering (clonal rootstocks). After about a year of growing in a greenhouse, the young rootstocks are ready to be grafted. Terminal and lateral grafting is normally used. The scion cultivar grows for another 6–12 months before the tree is ready to be sold. Clonal rootstocks are selected for tolerance of specific soil and disease conditions, such as poor soil aeration or resistance to the soil-borne disease (root rot) caused by &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot;. Advances in cloning techniques that can produce up to 500 new plants from a single millimetre of tree cutting have the potential to increase the availability of rootstocks.

Commercial avocado production is limited to a small fraction of the vast genetic diversity in the species. Conservation of this genetic diversity has relied largely on field collection, as avocado seeds often do not survive storage in seed banks. This is problematic, as field preservation of living cultivars is expensive, and habitat loss threatens wild cultivars. More recently, an alternate method of conservation has been developed based on cryopreservation of avocado somatic embryos with reliable methods for somatic embryogenesis and reconstitution into living trees.

===As a houseplant===
The avocado tree can be grown domestically and used as a decorative houseplant. The pit germinates in normal soil conditions or partially submerged in a small glass (or container) of water. In the latter method, the pit sprouts in four to six weeks, at which time it is planted in standard houseplant potting soil. The plant normally grows large enough to be prunable; it does not bear fruit unless it has ample sunlight. Home gardeners can graft a branch from a fruit-bearing plant to speed maturity, which typically takes four to six years to bear fruit.

===Pests and diseases===

Avocado trees are vulnerable to bacterial, viral, fungal, and nutritional diseases (excesses and deficiencies of key minerals). Disease can affect all parts of the plant, causing spotting, rotting, cankers, pitting, and discoloration. The pyriform scale insect (&quot;Protopulvinaria pyriformis&quot;) is known from Australia, South Africa, Israel, Italy, France, Spain, Cuba, Florida, and Peru. It is normally found on avocado, and in Peru it is said to be the worst insect pest of the fruit. Certain cultivars of avocado seem more susceptible to attack by the scale than others.

===Cultivation by location===
====Cultivation in Mexico====

Mexico is by far the world&#x27;s largest avocado growing country, producing several times more than the second largest producer. In 2013, the total area dedicated to avocado production was , and the harvest was 2.03 million tonnes in 2017. The states that produce the most are México, Morelos, Nayarit, Puebla, and Michoacan, accounting for 86% of the total. In Michoacán, the cultivation is complicated by the existence of drug cartels that extort protection fees from cultivators. They are reported to exact 2,000 Mexican pesos per hectare from avocado farmers and 1 to 3 pesos/kg of harvested fruit. It is such a problem that the phrase &quot;blood guacamole&quot; has been adopted to describe the social effects in Mexico of the vast worldwide demand for its fruits.

====Cultivation in California====
Avocados were introduced to California from Nicaragua in the early 1850s, when avocado trees imported from the Central American country were observed and reported growing near San Gabriel. The avocado has since become a successful cash crop. About – as of 2015, some 80% of United States avocado production – is located in Southern California. 

Avocado is the official fruit of the state of California. Fallbrook, California, claims, without official recognition, the title of &quot;Avocado Capital of the World&quot; (also claimed by the town of Uruapan in Mexico), and both it and Carpinteria, California, host annual avocado festivals.

The California Avocado Commission and the California Avocado Society are the two major grower organizations and Calavo Growers is a major distributor.

====Cultivation in Peru====
&#x27;Hass&#x27; avocado production in Peru encompasses thousands of hectares in central and western Peru. Peru has now become the largest supplier of avocados imported to the European Union and the second largest supplier to Asia and the United States. The country&#x27;s location near the equator and along the Pacific Ocean creates consistently mild temperatures all year.

&#x27;Hass&#x27; avocados from Peru are seasonally available to consumers from May through September and are promoted under the auspices of the Peruvian Avocado Commission, headquartered in Washington, D.C.

====Cultivation in Chile====

Chile has produced avocados for over 100 years with production increasing dramatically in the early 1980s due to global demand. &quot;New York&quot; magazine reported in 2015 that &quot;Large avocado growers are draining the country&#x27;s groundwater and rivers faster than they can replenish themselves.&quot; 88% of total production and 99% of exported avocados from Chile are Hass avocados. Avocados are a staple fruit in Chile with 30% of production destined for the domestic market. No import tariffs are imposed on Chilean avocados by China, the United States, or the European Union due to free trade agreements.

===Cultivars===
====A cultivars====

* &#x27;Choquette&#x27;: A seedling from Miami, Florida. &#x27;Choquette&#x27; bore large fruit of good eating quality in large quantities and had good disease resistance, and thus became a major cultivar. Today &#x27;Choquette&#x27; is widely propagated in south Florida both for commercial growing and for home growing.
* &#x27;Gwen&#x27;: A seedling bred from &#x27;Hass&#x27; x &#x27;Thille&#x27; in 1982, &#x27;Gwen&#x27; is higher yielding and more dwarfing than &#x27;Hass&#x27; in California. The fruit has an oval shape, slightly smaller than &#x27;Hass&#x27; (), with a rich, nutty flavor. The skin texture is more finely pebbled than &#x27;Hass&#x27;, and is dull green when ripe. It is frost-hardy down to .
* &#x27;Hass&#x27;: The &#x27;Hass&#x27; is the most common cultivar of avocado. It produces fruit year-round and accounts for 80% of cultivated avocados in the world. All &#x27;Hass&#x27; trees are descended from a single &quot;mother tree&quot; raised by a mail carrier named Rudolph Hass, of La Habra Heights, California. Hass patented the productive tree in 1935. The &quot;mother tree&quot;, of uncertain subspecies, died of root rot and was cut down in September 2002. 
* &#x27;Lula&#x27;: A seedling reportedly grown from a &#x27;Taft&#x27; avocado planted in Miami on the property of George Cellon, it is named after Cellon&#x27;s wife, Lula. It was likely a cross between Guatemalan and Mexican types. &#x27;Lula&#x27; was recognized for its flavor and high oil content and propagated commercially in Florida.
* &#x27;Maluma&#x27;: A relatively new cultivar, it was discovered in South Africa in the early 1990s by Mr. A.G. (Dries) Joubert. It is a chance seedling of unknown parentage.
* &#x27;Pinkerton&#x27;: First grown on the Pinkerton Ranch in Saticoy, California, in the early 1970s, &#x27;Pinkerton&#x27; is a seedling of &#x27;Hass&#x27; x &#x27;Rincon&#x27;. The large fruit has a small seed, and its green skin deepens in color as it ripens. The thick flesh has a smooth, creamy texture, pale green color, good flavor, and high oil content. It shows some cold tolerance, to and bears consistently heavy crops. A hybrid Guatemalan type, it has excellent peeling characteristics.
* &#x27;Reed&#x27;: Developed from a chance seedling found in 1948 by James S. Reed in California, this cultivar has large, round, green fruit with a smooth texture and dark, thick, glossy skin. Smooth and delicate, the flesh has a slightly nutty flavor. The skin ripens green. A Guatemalan type, it is hardy to . Tree size is about .

====B cultivars====

* &#x27;Fuerte&#x27;: Commercialized in the U.S. from budwood imported from Atlixco, Mexico in 1911, Fuerte was the dominant commercial variety in the U.S. for the first half of the 20th century.
* &#x27;Sharwil&#x27;: Developed by James Cockburn Wilson (died 1990) with Frank Victor Sharpe in Tamborine Mountain, Queensland, Australia, in the 1950s, a portmanteau of Sharpe and Wilson. Wilson also developed the Willard variety (Wilson and Hazzard), imported the Reed variety into Australia, and developed the Shepard variety. Sharpe was later awarded a CMG in 1972 for services to the avocado industry. The variety originated in Guatemala.

====Other cultivars====
Other avocado cultivars include &#x27;Spinks&#x27;. Historically attested varieties (which may or may not survive among horticulturists) include the &#x27;Challenge&#x27;, &#x27;Dickinson&#x27;, &#x27;Kist&#x27;, &#x27;Queen&#x27;, &#x27;Rey&#x27;, &#x27;Royal&#x27;, &#x27;Sharpless&#x27;, and &#x27;Taft&#x27;.

====Stoneless avocado====
A stoneless avocado, marketed as a &quot;cocktail avocado&quot;, which does not contain a pit, is available on a limited basis. They are five to eight centimetres long; the whole fruit may be eaten, including the skin. It is produced from an unpollinated blossom in which the seed does not develop. Seedless avocados regularly appear on trees. Known in the avocado industry as &quot;cukes&quot;, they are usually discarded commercially due to their small size.

=== Production ===

In 2023, world production of avocados was 10.5 million tonnes, led by Mexico with 29% (3 million tonnes) of the total (table). Other major producers were Colombia, Dominican Republic, Peru, and Indonesia.

===International market===
A 2024 market analysis indicated that avocado exports will increase over the next five years with as many as 30 countries producing avocados, possibly becoming the world&#x27;s most traded fruit by 2030.

==Toxicity==
===Allergies===
Some people have allergic reactions to avocado. There are two main forms of allergy: those with a tree-pollen allergy develop local symptoms in the mouth and throat shortly after eating avocado; the second, known as latex-fruit syndrome, is related to latex allergy and symptoms include generalised urticaria, abdominal pain, and vomiting and can sometimes be life-threatening.

===Toxicity to animals===
Avocado leaves, bark, skin, or pit are documented to be harmful to animals; cats, dogs, cattle, goats, rabbits, rats, guinea pigs, birds, fish, and horses can be severely harmed or even killed when they consume them. The avocado fruit is poisonous to some birds, and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) lists it as toxic to horses.

Avocado leaves contain a toxic fatty acid derivative, persin, which in sufficient quantity can cause colic in horses and without veterinary treatment, death. The symptoms include gastrointestinal irritation, vomiting, diarrhea, respiratory distress, congestion, fluid accumulation around the tissues of the heart, and even death. Birds also seem to be particularly sensitive to this toxic compound.

The leaves of the Guatemalan variety of &quot;P. americana&quot; are toxic to goats, sheep, and horses.

==Uses==
=== Nutrition ===
Raw avocado flesh is 73% water, 15% fat, 9% carbohydrates, and 2% protein (table). In a 100-gram reference amount, avocado supplies , and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of several B vitamins (such as 28% DV in pantothenic acid) and vitamin K (20% DV), with moderate contents (10–19% DV) of vitamin C, vitamin E, and potassium. Avocados also contain phytosterols and carotenoids, such as lutein and zeaxanthin.

====Fat composition====
Avocados have diverse fats. For a typical one:

* About 75% of an avocado&#x27;s energy comes from fat, most of which (67% of total fat) is monounsaturated fat as oleic acid (table).
* Other predominant fats include palmitic acid and linoleic acid.
* The saturated fat content amounts to 14% of the total fat. 
* Typical total fat composition is roughly: 1% ω-3, 14% ω-6, 71% ω-9 (65% oleic and 6% palmitoleic), and 14% saturated fat (palmitic acid).

Although costly to produce, nutrient-rich avocado oil has a multitude of uses for salads or cooking and in cosmetics and soap products.

====Research====
In 2022, a prospective cohort study following 110,487 people for 30 years found that eating two servings of avocado per week reduced the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases by 16–22%. The study involved replacing half a daily serving of saturated fat sources, including margarine, butter, egg, yogurt, cheese, or processed meats, with an equivalent amount of avocado.

=== Culinary ===
The fruit of horticultural cultivars has a markedly higher fat content than most other fruit, mostly monounsaturated fat, and as such serves as an important staple in the diet of consumers who have limited access to other fatty foods (high-fat meats and fish, dairy products). Having a high smoke point, avocado oil is expensive compared to common salad and cooking oils, and is mostly used for salads or dips.

A ripe avocado yields to gentle pressure when held in the palm of the hand and squeezed. The flesh is prone to enzymatic browning, quickly turning brown after exposure to air. To prevent this, lime or lemon juice can be added to avocados after peeling.

The fruit is not sweet, but distinctly and subtly flavored, with smooth texture. It is used in both savory and sweet dishes, though in many countries not for both. The avocado is common in vegetarian cuisine as a substitute for meats in sandwiches and salads because of its high fat content.

Generally, avocado is served raw, though some cultivars, including the common &#x27;Hass&#x27;, can be cooked for a short time without becoming bitter. The flesh of some avocados may be rendered inedible by heat. Prolonged cooking induces this chemical reaction in all cultivars.

It is used as the base for the Mexican dip known as guacamole, as well as a spread on corn tortillas or toast, served with spices. Avocado is a primary ingredient in avocado soup. Avocado slices are frequently added to hamburgers and &quot;tortas&quot; and is a key ingredient in California rolls and other &quot;makizushi&quot; (&quot;maki&quot;, or rolled sushi).

===International===
In Mexico and Central America, avocados are served mixed with white rice, in soups, salads, or on the side of chicken and meat. They are also commonly added to &quot;pozole&quot;. In Peru, they are consumed with &quot;tequeños&quot; as mayonnaise, served as a side dish with &quot;parrillas&quot;, used in salads and sandwiches, or as a whole dish when filled with tuna, shrimp, or chicken. In Chile, it is used as a puree-like sauce with chicken, hamburgers, and hot dogs; and in slices for celery or lettuce salads. The Chilean version of Caesar salad contains large slices of mature avocado.

Avocados in savory dishes, often seen as exotic, are a relative novelty in Portuguese-speaking countries, such as Brazil, where the traditional preparation is mashed with sugar and lime, and eaten as a dessert or snack. This contrasts with Spanish-speaking countries such as Chile, Mexico, or Argentina, where the opposite is true and sweet preparations are rare. With the exception of the Philippines, a former Spanish colony where avocados are traditionally used in sweet preparations and savory uses are seen as exotic.

In the Philippines (where avocados were introduced from Mexico since before the 1700s), Brazil, Indonesia, Vietnam, and southern India (especially the coastal Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka region), avocados are frequently used for milkshakes and occasionally added to ice cream and other desserts. In Brazil, the Philippines Vietnam, and Indonesia, a dessert drink is made with sugar, milk or water, and pureed avocado. Chocolate syrup is sometimes added. In Morocco, a similar chilled avocado and milk drink is sweetened with confectioner&#x27;s sugar and flavored with a touch of orange flower water.

In Ethiopia, avocados are made into juice by mixing them with sugar and milk or water, usually served with Vimto and a slice of lemon. It is also common to serve layered multiple fruit juices in a glass (locally called &quot;Spris&quot;) made of avocados, mangoes, bananas, guavas, and papayas. Avocados are also used to make salads. In Kenya and Nigeria, the avocado is often eaten as a fruit alone or mixed with other fruits in a fruit salad, or as part of a vegetable salad. In Ghana, they are often eaten alone on sliced bread as a sandwich. In Sri Lanka, their well-ripened flesh, thoroughly mashed or pureed with milk and &quot;kitul&quot; treacle (a liquid jaggery made from the sap of the inflorescence of jaggery palms), is a common dessert. In Haiti, they are often consumed with cassava or regular bread for breakfast.

In the United Kingdom, the avocado became available during the 1960s when introduced by Sainsbury&#x27;s under the name &#x27;avocado pear&#x27;. Much of the success of avocados in the UK is attributed to a long-running promotional campaign initiated by South African growers in 1995. In Australia and New Zealand, avocados are commonly served on sandwiches, sushi, toast, or with chicken.

===Leaves===

In addition to the fruit, the leaves of Mexican avocados (&quot;Persea americana&quot; var. &quot;drymifolia&quot;) are used in some cuisines as a spice, with a flavor somewhat reminiscent of anise. They are sold both dried and fresh, toasted before use, and either crumbled or used whole, commonly in bean dishes.

<text>Sheridan College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning, formerly Sheridan College of Applied Arts and Technology, is a public polytechnic institute partnered with private Canadian College of Technology and Trades operating campuses across the Greater Toronto Area of Ontario, Canada.

Founded in 1967, it is known for academic programs in creative writing and publishing, animation and illustration, film and design, business, applied computing, and engineering technology, among others. Sheridan operates the Davis Campus in Brampton, the Trafalgar Road Campus in Oakville, and the Hazel McCallion Campus in Mississauga.

In 2024 Sheridan College&#x27;s investment in International student enrollment was blamed for the cancellation of 40 programs and major layoffs.

==History==
===Founding===
Sheridan College was established in 1967. The School of Graphic Design was located in Brampton, Ontario until 1970, when it moved to the new campus in Oakville, Ontario. The Brampton campus was a converted public high school that had previously been in condemned status until re-fitted for use by Sheridan College. The school and area were subsequently replaced by residential homes. The new Oakville location was still under construction when classes began in the fall of 1970. The classes were held in a large open area under triangular skylights which allowed excellent lighting for the students. The photography department used a well equipped photo studio area and darkrooms for processing film and prints. That building has become merged with many other structures as extensive expansion of the campus has occurred on an ongoing basis. The main courses taught that year were graphic design, fashion design, photography and animation.

===Contributions to animation===
In the 1960s and early 1970s, the Canadian animation industry was little formed and virtually non-existent, excepting animation pioneers of the National Film Board. and such Canadian studios as Crawley Films in Ottawa and The Guest Group in Toronto, a group of creative companies owned and run by Al Guest.

The Canadian animation landscape began to change in the late 1960s with Rocket Robin Hood, a Canadian animated series produced by Al Guest and his partner Jean Mathieson. In 1968 President Porter organized the school&#x27;s first course in classical animation, even though at the time there was little evidence of demand for graduates. The school took advantage of the closing of Al Guest&#x27;s studio following the production of Rocket Robin Hood and were able to buy up the cameras, animation and editing equipment. Subsequently, Guest and Mathieson served as creative advisors to Sheridan and hired a number of Sheridan graduates as key personnel for their new studio Rainbow Animation.

In 1984, Sheridan student Jon Minnis created the short animation piece &quot;Charade.&quot; The five-minute film was animated by Minnis with Pantone markers on paper during a single three-month summer term at Sheridan College. The film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 57th Academy Awards. As Sheridan&#x27;s animation department continued to grow, it produced hundreds of animators into Canadian and international studios, at one point in 1996 being called &quot;the Harvard of animation schools&quot; on &quot;a worldwide basis&quot; by animator Michael Hirsh. A significant number of graduates have held key positions at Walt Disney Animation Studios, Don Bluth Productions, Pixar Animation Studios, and DreamWorks Animation, both for traditional and CGI animation. Sheridan graduates include seven Academy Award nominees and two winners, including Domee Shi, the first woman to direct a Pixar animated short.

Animation faculty and alumni have also been recognized at the Emmy awards, including animation professor Kaj Pindal and alumni Jim Bryson, Bobby Chiu and Adam Jeffcoat.

In June 2018, animation alumnus Jon Klassen was named to the Order of Canada in recognition of his contributions to children&#x27;s literature. Klassen is the author and illustrator of the award-winning book, &quot;This is Not My Hat.&quot;

In 2018, Sheridan&#x27;s animation program celebrated the 50th anniversary of its founding. Today, the program aims to foster the same innovative and creative spirit in its current students as it did 50 years ago. Students now earn a four-year Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in Animation, and post-graduate programs in Computer Animation, Visual Effects and Character Animation are also available.

In 2019, Sheridan was ranked as the top animation school in the world outside the United States by Animation Career Review.

===Unsuccessful bid for university status===
Former President Dr. Jeff Zabudsky announced in 2012 that Sheridan College would seek to become a university by 2020. The college began implementing several changes to meet the non-binding criteria of a university as set by Universities Canada including: the establishment of an academic senate to set policy, increasing the number of degree-level courses, and increasing the number of instructors with master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees. The college appointed former Mayor of Mississauga Hazel McCallion as its first chancellor in 2016.

In 2018, it was announced that Sheridan will open a new campus in Brampton in partnership with Ryerson University. The campus will be located on south-east corner of Church Street West and Mill Street North in Brampton. The new campus will focus on delivering programs in science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM). However, this plan was cancelled in 2019.

In 2019, under the leadership of President Dr. Janet Morrison, the college unveiled a new five-year strategic plan that sets out a new vision for Sheridan: to bring together key elements of colleges, polytechnics and universities to create a new, standard-setting model of higher education.

===Focus on International Students===

In the late 2000&#x27;s Sheridan began focusing on increasing international enrolment. By 2010 roughly 10% of college enrolment were foreign students. Over the next six years Sheridan added over 4,500 more, raising the percentage of international students to nearly 30% in 2016-17. The increase led to community concerns regarding housing, access to healthcare and food insecurity. In the following six years the college enrolled an additional 5,591, the eighth highest number for Canadian post-secondary institutions in 2022-23.

The rise in human trafficking in Brampton, particularly targeting international students, led Sheridan to raise the issue with students as early 2019. In 2021, it was reported &quot;the top brass at Sheridan College&quot; refused to acknowledge the risk of human trafficking to international students. In 2022, the college produced a webinar to educate faculty and staff that Sheridan campuses are located in human trafficking &quot;hot spots&quot;, created a human trafficking resource handout for their students and worked with community services on human trafficking initiatives. In 2024, Brampton City Council passed a resolution aimed at tackling human trafficking of international students in their City, with reporting naming Sheridan as a popular destination. Mayor Patrick Brown, in October first acknowledged the issue publicly, noting that Brampton has the highest number of international students in the country, while asking for federal and provincial help. Months later Indian authorities alleged widespread human trafficking of international students.

The Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Design Technologies (CAMDT), located at the Brampton campus, is a 40,000 sq. ft. facility housing highly specialized manufacturing and design equipment. CAMDT allows Sheridan and its industry partners to collaborate on addressing challenges in the manufacturing sector, while developing graduates with the skills and practical knowledge to make an immediate and positive impact in the workplace.

=== Centre for Elder Research ===
The stated mission of Sheridan&#x27;s Centre for Elder Research is to enhance quality of life for older individuals, by developing, testing, and implementing new and realistic solutions to improve the day-to-day experiences of elders and their families. In 2018, the Centre was awarded $178,856 from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to further explore how emerging technologies, such as virtual reality tools, can be leveraged to enhance the health and well-being of older adults residing in congregate living facilities such as long-term care homes.

=== Screen Industries Research and Training Center (SIRT) ===
Opened at Pinewood Toronto Studios in 2010, Screen Industries Research and Training Center (SIRT) is a digital media sound stage and post-production facility that focuses on 2D and 3D stereoscopic production processes. SIRT was conceived and launched by Sheridan College to operate in connection to the creative industries and three levels of the Canadian government. The Center&#x27;s stated mission is to conduct high-level research on film, digital cinema, and high-definition technologies in all levels of production and display. The University of Waterloo announced in July 2010 that funding was awarded for joint research between their film department and SIRT.

In 2013, SIRT was designated as the first digital media Technology Access Centre in Ontario, supported through funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada&#x27;s (NSERC) College-Community Innovation program. In 2018, this funding was renewed for an additional five years to support further applied research and industry collaboration at SIRT.

The Canadian Music Theatre Project (CMTP) was established by Michael Rubinoff, and was an incubator for new musical theatre works by Canadian and international composers, lyricists and book-writers. CMTP connects creative teams with talented students who help bring new characters to life, creating an environment for material to be tested and rewritten. Three or four projects are selected each year, with a five-week workshop period culminating in staged readings in front of a 200-person audience of industry professionals and theatre enthusiasts. Since its inception in 2011, 225 students, 34 writers and composers and 25 guest directors and music directors have participated in the creation of 19 new musicals.

==== Connection to Come From Away ====
&quot;Come From Away&quot; began its life and development at the Canadian Music Theatre Project in 2012. Over two seasons, the CMTP provided the creative team 12 weeks of development time and support, with exceptional student performers, crew, and creative teams. Access to onsite recording facilities to create demo recordings aided in the continuing development of the musical. The workshops culminated in test performance with a full band and live audiences at Sheridan and the Panasonic Theatre in Toronto. The full, two-act musical was produced by Theatre Sheridan the following year. &quot;Come From Away&quot; was part of the National Alliance for Musical Theatre and Goodspeed Festivals of New Musicals. It was optioned by Tony-Award winning producers Junkyard Dog Productions.

As a credited producer on the musical, Sheridan became the first postsecondary institution to be nominated for Tony Award when Come From Away was recognized with a nomination for Best New Musical Tony in 2017.

<text>A picture book combines visual and verbal narratives in a book format, most often aimed at young children. With the narrative told primarily through text, they are distinct from comics, which do so primarily through sequential images. 

The images in picture books can be produced in a range of media, such as oil paints, acrylics, watercolor, and pencil. Picture books often serve as educational resources, aiding with children&#x27;s language development or understanding of the world. 

Three of the earliest works in the format of modern picture books are Heinrich Hoffmann&#x27;s &quot;Struwwelpeter&quot; from 1845, Benjamin Rabier&#x27;s &quot;Tintin-Lutin&quot; from 1898 and Beatrix Potter&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot; from 1902. Some of the best-known picture books are Robert McCloskey&#x27;s &quot;Make Way for Ducklings&quot;, Dr. Seuss&#x27;s &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;, and Maurice Sendak&#x27;s &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;. The Caldecott Medal (established 1938) is awarded annually for the best American picture book. Since the mid-1960s, several children&#x27;s literature awards have included a category for picture books.

==Target audiences==
Picture books are aimed at young children. Many are written with vocabulary a child can understand but not necessarily read. For this reason, picture books tend to have two functions in the lives of children: they are first read to young children by adults, and then children read them themselves once they begin learning to read.

==Categories==
The majority of picture books are constructed in the same way as books for older children and adults, but there are a number of special types. 

* Board books are picture books printed on sturdy cardboard—called paperboard—for young children who tend to be less careful with books. Paperboard is used for both the cover and the interior pages. The pages are specially folded and bound together.
* Soft books, also aimed at very young children, are made of cloth or soft plastic.
* Pop-up books employ paper engineering to make parts of the page pop up or stand up when pages are opened. &quot;The Wheels on the Bus&quot;, by Paul O. Zelinsky, is an example of a best-selling pop-up book.
* Touch and feel books included textured surfaces in the pictures. &quot;Pat the Bunny,&quot; by Dorothy Kunhardt, is a popular touch and feel book.
* Concept books teach children about specific themes such as the alphabet or shapes. A famous example is &quot;A Is for Apple&quot; by Georgie Birkett.
* Easy reader books are for children who are beginning to learn how to read and include simple text and descriptive illustrations.
* Non-fiction children&#x27;s books are used to teach children in a simple and accessible way.
* Wordless picture books tell a story only through images. They encourage creativity and can be appreciated by children who cannot yet read. A famous example of a wordless picture book is &quot;The Snowman&quot; by Raymond Briggs.

== Genre ==
The genre of picture books is unique because of the complementary relationship between text and art. Picture books have existed since 1658, when the first picture book specifically for children, Orbis Sensualium Pictus, was printed. The genre continues to be popular today. While some picture books are written and illustrated by the same person, others are collaborations between an author and an illustrator. These collaborations give equal power to both and allow each to bring their own creativity to the book. Children&#x27;s book illustrations can drive the plot or bring the plot to life. Editors of picture books often look carefully for an illustrator that matches the style of the text, while still adding their own artistic value to the book. There must be mutual respect between an author and an illustrator in the creation of a successful picture book.

== Pedagogy ==
Picture books can serve as important learning tools for young children. They are often used both in the classroom and at home to help children develop language and creativity skills. A psychology study showed that picture-less picture books have been shown to improve children&#x27;s storytelling skills and boost their engagement in books. Additionally, children&#x27;s picture books can help children tackle philosophical questions and life concepts. For example, Mac Barnett and Carson Ellis&#x27; picture book What is Love? serves not only as entertainment for children, but as an introduction to important life questions about love and empathy. A study in Australia found that reading postmodern picture books led to better text analysis skills for students. Picture books can also improve young children&#x27;s descriptive vocabulary and reading and drawing behaviors at home. The art element of picture books aids with creativity development and engagement with books. Not only can picture books help children develop literacy and creative skills, but they can also help children develop logical thinking and mathematical skills. Math-based stories can help children conceptualize mathematical concepts and develop language skills to discuss math.

== History ==

=== Early illustrated books ===

The production of illustrated books dates back to the earliest days of bookbinding. Medieval illuminated manuscripts were commissioned by the rich, and drawn by religious scribes. Perhaps the most important tradition of medieval art in regard to the development of picture books is the Poor Man&#x27;s Bible, which sought to make illustrations of important Biblical events so that they could be understood by the illiterate. These illustrations were generally found either on stained glass windows, or as illuminations in Paupers&#x27; Bibles.

&quot;Orbis Pictus&quot; from 1658 by John Amos Comenius was the earliest illustrated book specifically for children. It is something of a children&#x27;s encyclopedia and is illustrated by woodcuts. &quot;A Little Pretty Pocket-Book&quot; from 1744 by John Newbery was the earliest illustrated storybook marketed as pleasure reading in English. In Japan, &quot;kibyoshi&quot; were picture books from the 18th century, and are seen as a precursor to manga. Examples of 18th-century Japanese picture books include works such as Santō Kyōden&#x27;s &quot;Shiji no yukikai&quot; (1798).

The German children&#x27;s books &quot;Struwwelpeter&quot; (literally &quot;Shaggy-Peter&quot;) from 1845 by Heinrich Hoffmann, and &quot;Max and Moritz&quot; from 1865 by Wilhelm Busch, were among the earliest examples of modern picturebook design. Collections of Fairy tales from the early nineteenth century, like those by the Brothers Grimm or Hans Christian Andersen were sparsely illustrated, but beginning in the middle of the century, collections were published with images by illustrators like Gustave Doré, Fedor Flinzer, George Cruikshank, Vilhelm Pedersen, Ivan Bilibin and John Bauer. Andrew Lang&#x27;s twelve Fairy Books published between 1889 and 1910 were illustrated by among others Henry J. Ford and Lancelot Speed. Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, illustrated by John Tenniel in 1866 was one of the first highly successful entertainment books for children.
Toy books were introduced in the latter half of the 19th century, small paper-bound books with art dominating the text. These had a larger proportion of pictures to words than earlier books, and many of their pictures were in color. The best of these were illustrated by the triumvirate of English illustrators Randolph Caldecott, Walter Crane, and Kate Greenaway whose association with colour printer and wood engraver Edmund Evans produced books of great quality. In the late 19th and early 20th century a small number of American and British artists made their living illustrating children&#x27;s books, like Rose O&#x27;Neill, Arthur Rackham, Cicely Mary Barker, Willy Pogany, Edmund Dulac, W. Heath Robinson, Howard Pyle, or Charles Robinson. 

Beatrix Potter&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot; was published in 1902 to immediate success. &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot; was Potter&#x27;s first of many &quot;The Tale of...,&quot; including &quot;The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin&quot;, &quot;The Tale of Benjamin Bunny&quot;, &quot;The Tale of Tom Kitten&quot;, and &quot;The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck&quot;, to name but a few which were published in the years leading up to 1910. Swedish author Elsa Beskow wrote and illustrated some forty children&#x27;s stories and picture books between 1897–1952. Lang&#x27;s twelve Fairy Books published between 1889 and 1910 were illustrated by among others Henry J. Ford and Lancelot Speed.
In the US, illustrated stories for children appeared in magazines like &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot;, &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, and &quot;Woman&#x27;s Home Companion&quot;, intended for mothers to read to their children. Some cheap periodicals appealing to the juvenile reader started to appear in the early twentieth century, often with uncredited illustrations.

Helen Bannerman&#x27;s &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot; was published in 1899, and went through numerous printings and versions during the first decade of the twentieth century. It was part of a series of small-format books called The Dumpy Books for Children, published by British publisher Grant Richards between 1897 and 1904.

=== Early to mid-20th century ===
In 1913, Cupples &amp; Leon published a series of 15 &quot;All About&quot; books, emulating the form and size of the Beatrix Potter books, &quot;All About Peter Rabbit&quot;, &quot;All About the Three Bears&quot;, &quot;All About Mother Goose&quot;, and &quot;All About Little Red Hen&quot;. The latter, along with several others, was illustrated by Johnny Gruelle. Wanda Gág&#x27;s &quot;Millions of Cats&quot; was published in 1928 and became the first picture book to receive a Newbery Medal runner-up award. Wanda Gág followed with &quot;The Funny Thing&quot; in 1929, &quot;Snippy and Snappy&quot; in 1931, and then &quot;The ABC Bunny&quot; in 1933, which garnered her a second Newbery runner-up award.

In 1931, Jean de Brunhoff&#x27;s first Babar book, &quot;The Story of Babar&quot; was published in France, followed by &quot;The Travels of Babar&quot; then &quot;Babar the King&quot;. In 1930, Marjorie Flack authored and illustrated &quot;Angus and the Ducks&quot;, followed in 1931 by &quot;Angus and The Cats&quot;, then in 1932, &quot;Angus Lost&quot;. Flack authored another book in 1933, &quot;The Story About Ping&quot;, illustrated by Kurt Wiese. The &quot;Elson Basic Reader&quot; was published in 1930 and introduced the public to &quot;Dick and Jane&quot;. In 1930 &quot;The Little Engine That Could&quot; was published, illustrated by Lois Lenski. In 1954 it was illustrated anew by George and Doris Hauman. It spawned an entire line of books and related paraphernalia and coined the refrain &quot;I think I can! I think I can!&quot;. In 1936, Munro Leaf&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Ferdinand&quot; was published, illustrated by Robert Lawson. &quot;Ferdinand&quot; was the first picture book to cross over into pop culture. Walt Disney produced an animated feature film along with corresponding merchandising materials. In 1938 to Dorothy Lathrop was awarded the first Caldecott Medal for her illustrations in &quot;Animals of the Bible&quot;, written by Helen Dean Fish. Thomas Handforth won the second Caldecott Medal in 1939, for &quot;Mei Li&quot;, which he also wrote. Ludwig Bemelmans&#x27; &quot;Madeline&quot; was published in 1939 and was selected as a Caldecott Medal runner-up, today known as a Caldecott Honor book.

In 1942, Simon &amp; Schuster began publishing the Little Golden Books, a series of inexpensive, well illustrated, high quality children&#x27;s books. The eighth book in the series, &quot;The Poky Little Puppy&quot;, is the top selling children&#x27;s book of all time. Many of the books were bestsellers, including &quot;The Poky Little Puppy&quot;, &quot;Tootle&quot;, &quot;Scuffy the Tugboat&quot;, and &quot;The Little Red Hen&quot;. Several illustrators for the Little Golden Books later became staples within the picture book industry. Corinne Malvern, Tibor Gergely, Gustaf Tenggren, Feodor Rojankovsky, Richard Scarry, Eloise Wilkin, and Garth Williams. In 1947 &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot;, written by Margaret Wise Brown and illustrated by Clement Hurd, was published. By 1955, such picture book classics as &quot;Make Way for Ducklings&quot;, &quot;The Little House&quot;, &quot;Curious George&quot;, and &quot;Eloise&quot;, had all been published. In 1955 the first book was published in the &quot;Miffy&quot; series by Dutch author and illustrator Dick Bruna.

In 1937, Dr. Seuss (Theodor Seuss Geisel), at the time a successful graphic artist and humorist, published his first book for children, &quot;And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street&quot;. It was immediately successful, and Seuss followed up with &quot;The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins&quot; in 1938, followed by &quot;The King&#x27;s Stilts&quot; in 1939, and &quot;Horton Hatches the Egg&quot; in 1940, all published by Random House. From 1947 to 1956 Seuss had twelve children&#x27;s picture books published. Dr. Seuss created &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; in reaction to a Life magazine article by John Hersey in lamenting the unrealistic children in school primers books. Seuss rigidly limited himself to a small set of words from an elementary school vocabulary list, then crafted a story based upon two randomly selected words—cat and hat. Up until the mid-1950s, there was a degree of separation between illustrated educational books and illustrated picture books. That changed with &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; in 1957.

Because of the success of &quot;The Cat in The Hat&quot; an independent publishing company was formed, called Beginner Books. The second book in the series was nearly as popular, &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot;, published in 1958. Other books in the series were &quot;Sam and the Firefly&quot; (1958), &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; (1960), &quot;Are You My Mother?&quot; (1960), &quot;Go, Dog. Go!&quot; (1961), &quot;Hop on Pop&quot; (1963), and &quot;Fox in Socks&quot; (1965). Creators in the Beginner Book series were Stan and Jan Berenstain, P. D. Eastman, Roy McKie, and Helen Palmer Geisel (Seuss&#x27;s wife). The Beginner Books dominated the children&#x27;s picture book market of the 1960s.

Between 1957 and 1960 Harper &amp; Brothers published a series of sixteen &quot;I Can Read&quot; books. &quot;Little Bear&quot; was the first of the series. Written by Else Holmelund Minarik and illustrated by a then relatively unknown Maurice Sendak, the two collaborated on three other &quot;I Can Read&quot; books over the next three years. From 1958 to 1960, Syd Hoff wrote and illustrated four &quot;I Can Read&quot; books: &quot;Danny and the Dinosaur&quot;, &quot;Sammy the Seal&quot;, &quot;Julius&quot;, and &quot;Oliver&quot;.

=== Mid- to late 20th century ===
In 1949 American writer and illustrator Richard Scarry began his career working on the Little Golden Books series. His &quot;Best Word Book Ever&quot; from 1963 has sold 4 million copies. In total Scarry wrote and illustrated more than 250 books, and more than 100 million of his books have been sold worldwide. In 1963, &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; by American writer and illustrator Maurice Sendak was published. It has been adapted into other media several times, including an animated short in 1973, a 1980 opera, and, in 2009, a live-action feature film adaptation directed by Spike Jonze. By 2008 it had sold over 19 million copies worldwide. American illustrator and author Gyo Fujikawa created more than 50 books between 1963 and 1990. Her work has been translated into 17 languages and published in 22 countries. Her most popular books, &quot;Babies&quot; and &quot;Baby Animals&quot;, have sold over 1.7 million copies in the U.S. Fujikawa is recognized for being the earliest mainstream illustrator of picture books to include children of many races in her work.

Most of the Moomin books by Finnish author Tove Jansson were novels, but several Moomin picture books were also published between 1952 and 1980, like &quot;Who Will Comfort Toffle?&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Dangerous Journey&quot; (1977). The Barbapapa series of books by Annette Tison and Talus Taylor was published in France in the 1970s. They feature the shapeshifting pink blob Barbapapa and his numerous colorful children. The &quot;Mr. Men&quot; series of 40-some books by English author and illustrated Roger Hargreaves started in 1971. &quot;The Snowman&quot; by Raymond Briggs was published in Britain in 1978 and was entirely wordless. It was made into an Oscar nominated animated cartoon that has been shown every year since on British television.

Japanese author and illustrator Mitsumasa Anno has published a number of picture books, beginning in 1968 with &quot;Mysterious Pictures&quot;. In his &quot;Journey&quot; books a tiny character travels through depictions of the culture of various countries. &quot;Everyone Poops&quot; was first published in Japan in 1977, written and illustrated by the prolific children&#x27;s author Tarō Gomi. It has been translated into several languages. Published in 1978, Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;The Enormous Crocodile&quot; is in the style of a picture book in contrast to his other children&#x27;s books. Australian author Margaret Wild has written more than 40 books since 1984 and won several awards. In 1987 the first book was published in the &quot;Where&#x27;s Wally?&quot; (known as &quot;Where&#x27;s Waldo?&quot; in the United States and Canada) series by the British illustrator Martin Handford. The books were translated into many languages and the franchise also spawned a TV series, a comic strip and a series of video games. Since 1989 over 20 books have been created in the &quot;Elmer the Patchwork Elephant&quot; series by the British author David McKee. They have been translated in 40 languages and adapted into a children&#x27;s TV series.

==Technology and children&#x27;s books==

With the rapid technological changes, children have more options in the reading format. Print books are no longer the only choice; many are now available in digital versions. The usage of digital devices is increasing in the home and the school setting. Comparing digital and traditional printed books has become a popular topic. The University of California has conducted a study and revealed the differences in book format and how they impact children&#x27;s learning. 

Children who participated in this study were randomly assigned to read the same book in different formats: eBook or Print book. Reading experiences and outcomes were then accessed. The study found that children are more visually sustained with eBooks but less likely to recall the story sequence. However, there were no differences in behavioural engagement. There is a slight difference in remembering the story. Children remember the story a lot more when a person reads it than on a tablet. In conclusion of this study, children have equally attentive, vocal, and emotional engagement on both platforms. They remember more about the story sequence when reading a print book. Comparably, children talk about the device more when reading on a tablet, regardless of previous experience with digital reading. 

This study shows some differences when children read on a different platforms. However, the format differences do not heavily impact children&#x27;s reading experience when the contents are the same. 

==Picture book design==
===Interactive design in print picture books===
There are many ways to design interactive elements in picture books; it could involve how children flip the pages, how the information is revealed, and the placement of sensory elements like touch and smell. The study conducted by Liying Wang from Tongji University analyzed preschool children on book interaction design. It collects participants&#x27; emotional responses when interacting with six interactive elements: regular page flipping, open/close, rotates, touch and smell, pull/push, and puzzle. The study found that preschool children were quickly experiencing positive emotions when interacting with exciting forms. The most popular interaction forms are &quot;touch &amp; pull,&quot; &quot;puzzle,&quot; and &quot;pull/push.&quot; Moreover, there are no significant gender differences in the interest in interaction forms. Based on their findings, this study made the following recommendations for children&#x27;s book interaction design: First the study recommended creating suitable interaction elements to stimulate children&#x27;s positive emotions in reading. It will enhance engagement and positively affect the reading experience. Secondly, designers must pay attention to sensory experience in interactive design because it would mobilize reading initiative and increase concentration. Lastly, the interaction form should match the children&#x27;s cognitive characteristics, in which the elements should help narrative and reasoning. 

===Interactive design in digital picture books===
With the popularity of digital devices, children have more access to digital reading. Many studies analyze the impacts of digital books compared to traditional books, and the finding turns positive and negative depending on the variables. One of the studies shows that digital books could benefit children&#x27;s reading outcomes if the design of digital enhancement aligns with the story content. However, if the digital enhancement is unrelated to the narrative, like games, it will negatively impact children&#x27;s attention from reading, leading to poor comprehension. 

Recent research from the University of Stavanger presents many useful findings for designers regarding digital children&#x27;s book design. Rather than weigh the advantages and disadvantages of digital children&#x27;s books, it was focused on book design enhancements that could be optimized to increase children&#x27;s learning. The most significant finding from this research supports previous studies on book design enhancement. Children benefit in meaning-making when the enhancement is designed to align with the story, like providing background knowledge of the story event. In contrast, children will be distracted if the design enhancement does not support the storyline, as with the pop-up dictionary emended in the story.

==Awards==
In 1938, the American Library Association (ALA) began presenting the Caldecott Medal for the most distinguished American picture book published in the year, awarded to the book&#x27;s illustrator. The Caldecott Medal was established as a sister award to the ALA&#x27;s Newbery Medal, which since 1922 has been awarded to the most distinguished American children&#x27;s book published in the year. During the mid-forties to early fifties, Caldecott honorees included Marcia Brown, Barbara Cooney, Roger Duvoisin, Berta and Elmer Hader, Robert Lawson, Robert McCloskey, Dr. Seuss, Maurice Sendak, Ingri and Edgar Parin d&#x27;Aulaire, Leo Politi, Tasha Tudor, and Leonard Weisgard.

The Kate Greenaway Medal was established in the United Kingdom in 1955 in honour of the children&#x27;s illustrator, Kate Greenaway. The medal is given annually to an outstanding work of illustration in children&#x27;s literature (not necessarily in a picture book). It is awarded by Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP). The Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis (German Youth literature prize) has included a category for picture books since 1965. The IBBY Hans Christian Andersen Award for Illustration has been awarded since 1966. The Boston Globe-Horn Book Award, first presented in 1967, includes a category for picture books. 

In 2006, the ALA started awarding the Geisel Award, named after Dr. Seuss, to the most distinguished beginning reader book. The award is presented to both the author and illustrator, in &quot;literary and artistic achievements to engage children in reading.&quot; The Golden Pinwheel Young Illustrators Award was established in China in 2015. It includes an award for Chinese works and an international award.

<text>In mathematics, a square matrix is a matrix with the same number of rows and columns. An &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix is known as a square matrix of order Any two square matrices of the same order can be added and multiplied. 

Square matrices are often used to represent simple linear transformations, such as shearing or rotation. For example, if formula_1 is a square matrix representing a rotation (rotation matrix) and formula_2 is a column vector describing the position of a point in space, the product formula_3 yields another column vector describing the position of that point after that rotation. If formula_2 is a row vector, the same transformation can be obtained using where formula_5 is the transpose of 

==Main diagonal==

The entries formula_6 () form the main diagonal of a square matrix. They lie on the imaginary line which runs from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the matrix. For instance, the main diagonal of the 4×4 matrix above contains the elements , , , . 

The diagonal of a square matrix from the top right to the bottom left corner is called &quot;antidiagonal&quot; or &quot;counterdiagonal&quot;.

== Special kinds ==

=== Diagonal or triangular matrix ===
If all entries outside the main diagonal are zero, formula_7 is called a diagonal matrix. If all entries below (resp. above) the main diagonal are zero, formula_7 is called an upper (resp. lower) triangular matrix.

=== Identity matrix ===
The identity matrix formula_9 of size formula_10 is the formula_11 matrix in which all the elements on the main diagonal are equal to 1 and all other elements are equal to 0, e.g.
formula_12
It is a square matrix of order and also a special kind of diagonal matrix. The term &quot;identity matrix&quot; refers to the property of matrix multiplication that
formula_13 for any formula_14 matrix 

===Invertible matrix and its inverse===
A square matrix formula_7 is called &quot;invertible&quot; or &quot;non-singular&quot; if there exists a matrix formula_16 such that
formula_17
If formula_16 exists, it is unique and is called the &quot;inverse matrix&quot; of denoted 

===Symmetric or skew-symmetric matrix===
A square matrix formula_7 that is equal to its transpose, i.e., is a symmetric matrix. If instead then formula_7 is called a skew-symmetric matrix. 

For a complex square matrix often the appropriate analogue of the transpose is the conjugate transpose defined as the transpose of the complex conjugate of A complex square matrix formula_7 satisfying formula_22 is called a Hermitian matrix. If instead then formula_7 is called a skew-Hermitian matrix.

By the spectral theorem, real symmetric (or complex Hermitian) matrices have an orthogonal (or unitary) eigenbasis; i.e., every vector is expressible as a linear combination of eigenvectors. In both cases, all eigenvalues are real.

===Definite matrix===

A symmetric -matrix is called &quot;positive-definite&quot; (respectively negative-definite; indefinite), if for all nonzero vectors formula_24 the associated quadratic form given by
formula_25
takes only positive values (respectively only negative values; both some negative and some positive values). If the quadratic form takes only non-negative (respectively only non-positive) values, the symmetric matrix is called positive-semidefinite (respectively negative-semidefinite); hence the matrix is indefinite precisely when it is neither positive-semidefinite nor negative-semidefinite.

A symmetric matrix is positive-definite if and only if all its eigenvalues are positive. The table at the right shows two possibilities for 2×2 matrices.

Allowing as input two different vectors instead yields the bilinear form associated to :
formula_26

=== Orthogonal matrix ===
An &quot;orthogonal matrix&quot; is a square matrix with real entries whose columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors (i.e., orthonormal vectors). Equivalently, a matrix &quot;A&quot; is orthogonal if its transpose is equal to its inverse:
formula_27
which entails
formula_28
where &quot;I&quot; is the identity matrix. 

An orthogonal matrix is necessarily invertible (with inverse ), unitary (), and normal (). The determinant of any orthogonal matrix is either +1 or −1. The special orthogonal group formula_29 consists of the orthogonal matrices with determinant +1. 

The complex analogue of an orthogonal matrix is a unitary matrix.

===Normal matrix===
A real or complex square matrix formula_7 is called &quot;normal&quot; if If a real square matrix is symmetric, skew-symmetric, or orthogonal, then it is normal. If a complex square matrix is Hermitian, skew-Hermitian, or unitary, then it is normal. Normal matrices are of interest mainly because they include the types of matrices just listed and form the broadest class of matrices for which the spectral theorem holds.

==Operations==
===Trace===
The trace, tr(&quot;A&quot;) of a square matrix &quot;A&quot; is the sum of its diagonal entries. While matrix multiplication is not commutative, the trace of the product of two matrices is independent of the order of the factors: 
formula_31
This is immediate from the definition of matrix multiplication:
formula_32
Also, the trace of a matrix is equal to that of its transpose, i.e.,
formula_33

===Determinant===

The &quot;determinant&quot; formula_34 or formula_35 of a square matrix formula_7 is a number encoding certain properties of the matrix. A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is nonzero. Its absolute value equals the area (in formula_37) or volume (in formula_38) of the image of the unit square (or cube), while its sign corresponds to the orientation of the corresponding linear map: the determinant is positive if and only if the orientation is preserved.

The determinant of 2×2 matrices is given by
formula_39
The determinant of 3×3 matrices involves 6 terms (rule of Sarrus). The more lengthy Leibniz formula generalizes these two formulae to all dimensions.

The determinant of a product of square matrices equals the product of their determinants:
formula_40
Adding a multiple of any row to another row, or a multiple of any column to another column, does not change the determinant. Interchanging two rows or two columns affects the determinant by multiplying it by −1. Using these operations, any matrix can be transformed to a lower (or upper) triangular matrix, and for such matrices the determinant equals the product of the entries on the main diagonal; this provides a method to calculate the determinant of any matrix. Finally, the Laplace expansion expresses the determinant in terms of minors, i.e., determinants of smaller matrices. This expansion can be used for a recursive definition of determinants (taking as starting case the determinant of a 1×1 matrix, which is its unique entry, or even the determinant of a 0×0 matrix, which is 1), that can be seen to be equivalent to the Leibniz formula. Determinants can be used to solve linear systems using Cramer&#x27;s rule, where the division of the determinants of two related square matrices equates to the value of each of the system&#x27;s variables.

===Eigenvalues and eigenvectors===

A number and a non-zero vector formula_2 satisfying
formula_42
are called an &quot;eigenvalue&quot; and an &quot;eigenvector&quot; of respectively. The number is an eigenvalue of an -matrix if and only if is not invertible, which is equivalent to
formula_43
The polynomial in an indeterminate given by evaluation of the determinant is called the characteristic polynomial of . It is a monic polynomial of degree &quot;n&quot;. Therefore the polynomial equation has at most &quot;n&quot; different solutions, i.e., eigenvalues of the matrix. They may be complex even if the entries of are real. According to the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, , that is, the result of substituting the matrix itself into its own characteristic polynomial yields the zero matrix.

<text>Bokmål () (, ; ) is one of the official written standards for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is by far the most used written form of Norwegian today, as it is adopted by 85% to 90% of the population in Norway. There is no countrywide standard or agreement on the pronunciation of Bokmål and the spoken dialects vary greatly.

Bokmål is regulated by the governmental Language Council of Norway. A related, more conservative orthographic standard, commonly known as &quot;Riksmål&quot;, is regulated by the non-governmental Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature. The written standard is a Norwegianised variety of the Danish language.

The first Bokmål orthography was officially adopted in 1907 under the name &quot;Riksmål&quot; after being under development since 1879. The architects behind the reform were Marius Nygaard and Jacob Jonathan Aars. It was an adaptation of written Danish- commonly used since the past union with Denmark- to Dano-Norwegian, the koiné spoken by the Norwegian urban elite, especially in the capital. When the large conservative newspaper adopted the 1907 orthography in 1923, Danish writing was practically out of use in Norway. The name &quot;Bokmål&quot; was officially adopted in 1929 after a proposition to call the written language &quot;Dano-Norwegian&quot; lost by a single vote in the Lagting.

The government does not regulate &quot;spoken&quot; Bokmål and recommends that normalised pronunciation should follow the phonology of the speaker&#x27;s local dialect. Nevertheless, there is a spoken variety of Norwegian that, in the region of South-Eastern Norway, is commonly seen as the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for spoken Bokmål. In &quot;The Phonology of Norwegian&quot;, Gjert Kristoffersen writes that

Standard Østnorsk () or sometimes described as &quot;Urban East Norwegian&quot; is the pronunciation most commonly given in dictionaries. However, Standard Østnorsk as a spoken language is not used (and does not have prestige) outside South-Eastern Norway. All spoken variations of the Norwegian language are used in the Storting (parliament) and in Norwegian national broadcasters such as NRK and TV 2, even in cases where the conventions of Bokmål are used. The spoken variation typically reflects a speaker&#x27;s native region.

== History ==
Up until about 1300, the written language of Norway, Old Norwegian, was essentially the same as the other Old Norse dialects. The speech, however, was gradually differentiated into local and regional dialects. As long as Norway remained an independent kingdom, the written language remained essentially constant.

In 1380, Norway entered into a personal union with Denmark. By the early 16th century, Norway had lost its separate political institutions, and together with Denmark formed the political unit known as Denmark–Norway until 1814, progressively becoming the weaker member of the union. During this period, the modern Danish and Norwegian languages emerged. Norwegian went through a Middle Norwegian transition, and a Danish written language more heavily influenced by Low German was gradually standardised. This process was aided by the Reformation, which prompted Christiern Pedersen&#x27;s translation of the Bible into Danish. Remnants of written Old Norse and Norwegian were thus displaced by the Danish standard, which became used for virtually all administrative documents.

Norwegians used Danish primarily in writing, but it gradually came to be spoken by urban elites on formal or official occasions. Although Danish never became the spoken language of the vast majority of the population, by the time Norway&#x27;s ties with Denmark were severed in 1814, a Dano-Norwegian vernacular often called the &quot;educated daily speech&quot; had become the mother tongue of elites in most Norwegian cities, such as Bergen, Kristiania and Trondheim. This Dano-Norwegian &quot;koiné&quot; could be described as Danish with regional Norwegian pronunciation (see Norwegian dialects), some Norwegian vocabulary, and simplified grammar.

With the gradual subsequent process of Norwegianisation of the written language used in the cities of Norway, from Danish to Bokmål and Riksmål, the upper-class sociolects in the cities changed accordingly. In 1814, when Norway was ceded from Denmark to Sweden, Norway defied Sweden and its allies, declared independence and adopted a democratic constitution. Although compelled to submit to a dynastic union with Sweden, this spark of independence continued to burn, influencing the evolution of language in Norway. Old language traditions were revived by the patriotic poet Henrik Wergeland (1808–1845), who championed an independent non-Danish written language. Haugen indicates that:
&quot;Within the first generation of liberty, two solutions emerged and won adherents, one based on the speech of the upper class and one on that of the common people. The former called for Norwegianisation of the Danish writing, the latter for a brand new start.&quot;

The more conservative of the two language transitions was advanced by the work of writers like Peter Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe, schoolmaster and agitator for language reform Knud Knudsen, and Knudsen&#x27;s famous disciple, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, as well as a more cautious Norwegianisation by Henrik Ibsen. In particular, Knudsen&#x27;s work on language reform in the mid-19th century was important for the 1907 orthography and a subsequent reform in 1917, so much so that he is now often called the &quot;father of Bokmål&quot;.

== Controversy ==
===Riksmål versus Bokmål===
Since the creation of Landsmål, the Danish written in Norway was referred to as &quot;(det almindelige) Bogmaal&quot;, etc. (&quot;(The ordinary) book language&quot;), e.g. in &quot;Den norske Literatur fra 1814 indtil vore Dage&quot; (Hans Olaf Hansen, 1862), or the synonym &quot;Bogsprog&quot;, e.g. in the 1885 decision that adopted Landsmål as a co-official language.

The term &quot;Riksmål&quot; (&quot;Rigsmaal&quot;), meaning &quot;National Language&quot;, was first proposed by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson in 1899 as a name for the Norwegian variety of written Danish as well as spoken Dano-Norwegian. It was borrowed from Denmark where it denoted standard written and spoken Danish. The same year the Riksmål movement became organised under his leadership in order to fight against the growing influence of Nynorsk, eventually leading to the foundation of the non-governmental organisation Riksmålsforbundet in 1907, which he led until his death in 1910.

The 1907 reform documents do not mention the language by name, but the term &quot;Riksmål&quot; eventually caught on and was adopted by the Ministry of Church and Education in the years leading up to the 1917 spelling reform, appearing in its 1908 publication &quot;Utredning av spørsmaalet om et mulig samarbeide mellem landsmaal og riksmaal i retskrivningen&quot; (&quot;Investigation of the question of a possible cooperation between Landmål and Riksmål with regards to orthography&quot;). Through this work an official policy to merge the standards (to a common &quot;Samnorsk&quot;) through spelling reforms came to be.

In line with these plans, the 1917 reform introduced some elements from Norwegian dialects and Nynorsk as optional alternatives to traditional Dano-Norwegian forms. The reform met some resistance from the Riksmål movement, and &quot;Riksmålsvernet&quot; (The Society for the Protection of Riksmål) was founded in 1919.

In 1929, the parliament voted to rename the written standards. &quot;Bokmål&quot; was re-introduced as the official name for the Dano-Norwegian standard, replacing &quot;Riksmål&quot;, while &quot;Landsmål&quot; was renamed &quot;Nynorsk&quot;.

In 1938 both written standards were heavily reformed and many common spellings and grammatical endings were made mandatory. This meant the removal of many traditional Dano-Norwegian forms in Bokmål, a decision that was harshly criticised by the Riksmål movement for being too radical and premature. While it criticised the adoption of Nynorsk spellings, it initially also expressed support for making the orthography more phonemic, for instance by removing silent h&#x27;s in interrogative pronouns (which was done in Swedish a few years earlier).

The resistance culminated in the 1950s under the leadership of Arnulf Øverland. Riksmålsforbundet organised a parents&#x27; campaign against Samnorsk in 1951, and the Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature was founded in 1953. Because of this resistance, the 1959 reform was relatively modest, and some of the common traditional Danish spellings and inflections were admitted back into the standard through the reforms in 1981 and 2005.

Currently, Riksmål denotes a language form regulated by the non-governmental organisation The Norwegian Academy of Language and Literature. It is based on pre-1938 Bokmål and has been regulated by The Academy as a private alternative to the official Bokmål spelling standard since the 1950s. Over time it has accepted widespread &quot;radical&quot; spellings into the Riksmål standard. Since the official Samnorsk policy was abolished, Riksmål and Bokmål have converged, and The Academy currently edits an online dictionary that covers both. The differences have diminished (now being comparable to American and British English differences), but The Academy still upholds its own standard.

Norway&#x27;s most popular daily newspaper, , is notable for its use of Riksmål as its standard language. Use of Riksmål is rigorously pursued, even with regard to readers&#x27; letters, which are &quot;translated&quot; into the standard. gave up its most markedly conservative &quot;signal words&quot; in 1990.

While the specifics of the debate are unique to Norway, some parallels can be found in Austrian German and the One Standard German Axiom, which revolves over the kind of standard to be used in a non-dominant country.

===Terminology===

In the Norwegian discourse, the term &quot;Dano-Norwegian&quot; is seldom used with reference to contemporary Bokmål and its spoken varieties. The nationality of the language has been a hotly debated topic, and its users and proponents have generally not been fond of the implied association with Danish (hence the neutral names &quot;Riksmål&quot; and &quot;Bokmål&quot;, meaning &quot;state language&quot; and &quot;book language&quot; respectively). The debate intensified with the advent of Nynorsk in the 19th century, a written language based on rural Modern Norwegian dialects and puristic opposition to the Danish and Dano-Norwegian spoken in Norwegian cities.

== Characteristics ==

===Differences from Danish===
The following table shows a few central differences between Bokmål and Danish.

===Differences from the traditional Oslo dialect===
Most natives of Oslo today speak a dialect that is an amalgamation of &quot;vikværsk&quot; (which is the technical term for the traditional dialects in the Oslofjord area) and written Danish; and subsequently Riksmål and Bokmål, which primarily inherited their non-Oslo elements from Danish. The present-day Oslo dialect is also influenced by other Eastern Norwegian dialects.

The following table shows some important cases where traditional Bokmål and Standard Østnorsk followed Danish rather than the traditional Oslo dialect as it is commonly portrayed in literature about Norwegian dialects. In many of these cases, radical Bokmål follows the traditional Oslo dialect and Nynorsk, and these forms are also given.
1 Closest match to the traditional Oslo dialect.

2 However, Bokmål uses &quot;ku&quot; &quot;cow&quot; and (now archaic) &quot;su&quot; &quot;sow&quot; exclusively.

<doc id="166029" wikidata="Q1996993" url="?curid=166029" title="Police brutality">
<text>Police brutality is the excessive and unwarranted use of force by law enforcement against an individual or a group. It is an extreme form of police misconduct and is a civil rights violation. Police brutality includes, but is not limited to, asphyxiation, beatings, shootings, improper takedowns, racially-motivated violence and unwarranted use of tasers.
== History ==
The first modern police force is widely regarded to be the Metropolitan Police Service in London, established in 1829. However, some scholars argue that early forms of policing began in the Americas as early as the 1500s on plantation colonies in the Caribbean. These slave patrols quickly spread across other regions and contributed to the development of the earliest examples of modern police forces. Early records suggest that labor strikes were the first large-scale incidents of police brutality in the United States, including events like the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, the Pullman Strike of 1894, the 1912 Lawrence textile strike, the Ludlow massacre of 1914, the Great Steel Strike of 1919, and the Hanapepe massacre of 1924.

The term &quot;police brutality&quot; was first used in Britain in the mid-19th century, by &quot;The Puppet-Show&quot; magazine (a short-lived rival to &quot;Punch&quot;) in September 1848, when they wrote:

The first use of the term in the American press was in 1872 when the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported the beating of a civilian who was under arrest at the Harrison Street Police Station.

In the United States, it is common for marginalized groups to perceive the police as oppressors, rather than protectors or enforcers of the law, due to the statistically disproportionate number of minority incarcerations.

Hubert G. Locke wrote:

Sometimes riots, e.g. the 1992 Los Angeles riots, are a reaction to police brutality.

== Causes ==


=== Hard on drugs campaigns ===

In nations with a reputation for having a high number of drug-related issues, including gang violence, drug trafficking, and overdose deaths, one common solution that government will enact is a collective campaign against drugs that spans the entirety of the state&#x27;s establishment. Changes to address these issues encompass education, bureaucracy, and, most notably, law enforcement policy and tactics. Law enforcement agencies expand and receive more funding to attack drug problems in communities. Acceptance of harsher policing tactics grows as well, as an philosophy develops within the law enforcement community and the militarization of local police forces. However, many studies have concluded that these efforts are in vain, as the drug market has grown in such nations despite anti-drug policies. For example, in the United States, critics of the War on Drugs waged by the government have been very vocal about the ineffectiveness of the policy, citing an increase in drug-related crimes and overdoses since President Nixon first introduced this policy.

=== Legal system ===

A type of government failure that can result in the normalization of police brutality is a lack of accountability and repercussions for officers mistreating civilians. While it is currently commonplace for civilians to hold officers accountable by recording them, the actual responsibility of police oversight rests heavily on the criminal justice system of a given nation, as police represent the enforcement of the law. One method of increasing police accountability that has become more common is the employment of body cameras as a part of police uniforms. However, the effectiveness of body cameras has been called into question due to the lack of transparency shown in police brutality cases where the footage is withheld from the public. In many cases of police brutality, the criminal justice system has no policy in place to condemn or prohibit police brutality. Certain nations have laws that permit lawful, violent treatment of civilians, like qualified immunity, which protects officers from being sued for their use of violence if their actions can be justified under the law.

Police officers are legally permitted to use force. Jerome Herbert Skolnick writes in regards to dealing largely with disorderly elements of the society, &quot;some people working in law enforcement may gradually develop an attitude or sense of authority over society, particularly under traditional reaction-based policing models; in some cases, the police believe that they are above the law.&quot;

There are many reasons why police officers can sometimes be excessively aggressive. It is thought that psychopathy makes some officers more inclined to use excessive force than others. In one study, police psychologists surveyed officers who had used excessive force. The information obtained allowed the researchers to develop five unique types of officers, only one of which was similar to the bad apples stereotype. These include personality disorders; previous traumatic job-related experience; young, inexperienced, or authoritarian officers; officers who learn inappropriate patrol styles; and officers with personal problems. Schrivers categorized these groups and separated the group that was the most likely to use excessive force. However, this &quot;bad apple paradigm&quot; is considered by some to be an &quot;easy way out&quot;. A broad report commissioned by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) on the causes of misconduct in policing calls it &quot;a simplistic explanation that permits the organization and senior management to blame corruption on individuals and individual faultsbehavioural, psychological, background factors, and so on, rather than addressing systemic factors.&quot; The report continues to discuss the systemic factors, which include:

* Pressures to conform to certain aspects of &quot;police culture&quot;, such as the Blue Code of Silence, which can &quot;sustain an oppositional criminal subculture protecting the interests of police who violate the law&quot; and a &quot;″we-they&#x27; perspective in which outsiders are viewed with suspicion or distrust&quot;
* Command and control structures with a rigid hierarchical foundation (&quot;results indicate that the more rigid the authoritarian hierarchy, the lower the scores on a measure of ethical decision-making&quot; concludes one study reviewed in the report); and
* Deficiencies in internal accountability mechanisms (including internal investigation processes).

The use of force by police officers is not kept in check in many jurisdictions by the issuance of a use of force continuum, which describes levels of force considered appropriate in direct response to a suspect&#x27;s behavior. This power is granted by the government, with few if any limits set out in statutory law as well as common law.

Violence used by police can be excessive despite being lawful, especially in the context of political repression. Police brutality is often used to refer to violence used by the police to achieve politically desirable ends (terrorism) and, therefore, when none should be used at all according to widely held values and cultural norms in the society (rather than to refer to excessive violence used where at least some may be considered justifiable).

Studies show that there are officers who believe the legal system they serve is failing and that they must pick up the slack. This is known as &quot;vigilantism&quot;, where the officer-involved may think the suspect deserves more punishment than what they may have to serve under the court system.

During high-speed pursuits of suspects, officers can become angry and filled with adrenaline, which can affect their judgment when they finally apprehend the suspect. The resulting loss of judgment and heightened emotional state can result in inappropriate use of force. The effect is colloquially known as &quot;high-speed pursuit syndrome&quot;.

== Global prevalence ==

* The Amnesty International 2007 report on human rights also documented widespread police misconduct in many other countries, especially countries with authoritarian regimes
* In the UK, the reports into the death of New Zealand teacher and anti-racism campaigner Blair Peach in 1979 was published on the Metropolitan Police website on 27 April 2010. They concluded that Peach was killed by a police officer, but that the other police officers in the same unit had refused to cooperate with the inquiry by lying to investigators, making it impossible to identify the actual killer.
* In the UK, Ian Tomlinson was filmed by an American tourist being hit with a baton and pushed to the floor as he was walking home from work during the 2009 G-20 London summit protests. Tomlinson then collapsed and died. Although he was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, the officer who allegedly assaulted Tomlinson was released without charge. He was later dismissed for gross misconduct.
* In the UK, in 2005, a young Brazilian man was arrested and shot by Metropolitan Police in Central London. The man, Jean Charles Menezes, died later.
* In Serbia, police brutality occurred in numerous cases during protests against Slobodan Milošević, and has also been recorded at protests against governments since Milošević lost power. The most recent case was recorded in July 2010, when five people, including two girls, were arrested, handcuffed, beaten with clubs, and mistreated for one hour. Security camera recordings of the beating were obtained by the media and public outrage when released. Police officials, including Ivica Dačić, the Serbian minister of internal affairs, denied this sequence of events and accused the victims &quot;to have attacked the police officers first&quot;. He also publicly stated that &quot;police [aren&#x27;t] here to beat up citizens&quot;, but that it is known &quot;what one is going to get when attacking the police&quot;.
* Episodes of police brutality in India include the Rajan case, the death of Udayakumar, and of Sampath.
* Police violence episodes against peaceful demonstrators appeared during the 2011 Spanish protests Furthermore, on 4 August 2011, Gorka Ramos, a journalist of &quot;Lainformacion&quot; was beaten by police and arrested while covering 15-M protests near the Interior Ministry in Madrid. A freelance photographer, Daniel Nuevo, was beaten by police while covering demonstrations against the Pope&#x27;s visit in August 2011.
* In Brazil, incidents of police violence have been very well-reported and Brazil has one of the highest prevalences of police brutality in the world today
* South Africa from apartheid to today has had incidents of police brutality, though police violence is not as prevalent as during the apartheid years

== Investigation ==
In England and Wales, an independent organization known as the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigates reports of police misconduct. They automatically investigate any deaths caused by or thought to be caused by, police action.

A similar body known as the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) operates in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland has a similar role to that of the IPCC and PIRC.

In Africa, there exist two such bodies: one in South Africa and another one in Kenya known as the Independent Policing Oversight Authority.

In the United States, more police are wearing body cameras after the shooting of Michael Brown. The US Department of Justice has made a call to action for police departments across the nation to implement body cameras in their departments so that further investigation will be possible.

== Measurement ==

Police brutality is measured based on the accounts of people who have experienced or seen it, as well as the juries who are present for trials involving police brutality cases, as there is no objective method to quantify the use of excessive force for any particular situation.

In addition to this, police brutality may also be filmed by police body cameras, worn by police officers. Whereas body cams could be a tool against police brutality (by prevention, and by increasing accountability). However according to Harlan Yu, executive director from Upturn, for this to occur, it needs to be embedded in a broader change in culture and legal framework. In particular, the public&#x27;s ability to access the body camera footage can be an issue.

In 1985, only one out of five people thought that police brutality was a serious problem. Police brutality is relative to a situation: it depends on if the suspect is resisting. Out of the people who were surveyed about their account of police brutality in 2008, only about 12 percent felt as if they had been resisting. Although the police force itself cannot be quantified, the opinion of brutality among various races, genders, and ages can. African Americans, women, and younger people are more likely to have negative opinions about the police than Caucasians, men, and middle-aged to elderly individuals.

== Independent oversight ==
Various community groups have criticized police brutality. These groups often stress the need for oversight by independent civilian review boards and other methods of ensuring accountability for police action.

Umbrella organizations and justice committees usually support those affected. Amnesty International is a non-governmental organization focused on human rights with over threemillion members and supporters around the world. The stated objective of the organization is &quot;to conduct research and generate action to prevent and end grave abuses of human rights, and to demand justice for those whose rights have been violated&quot;.

Tools used by these groups include video recordings, which are sometimes broadcast using websites such as YouTube.

Civilians have begun independent projects to monitor police activity to try to reduce violence and misconduct. These are often called &quot;Cop Watch&quot; programs.

<doc id="166033" wikidata="Q3027805" url="?curid=166033" title="Old Faithful Inn">
<text>The Old Faithful Inn is a hotel in the western United States with a view of the Old Faithful Geyser, located in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. The Inn has a multi-story log lobby, flanked by long frame wings containing guest rooms. In the western portion of the park, it sits at an approximate elevation of above sea level.

With its log and limb lobby and massive (, ) stone fireplace, the inn is an example of the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of rustic resort architecture, a style which is also known as National Park Service Rustic. It is one of the few log hotels still standing in the United States, and was the first of the great park lodges of the American west.

Initial construction was carried out over the winter of 1903–1904, largely using locally obtained materials including lodgepole pine and rhyolite stone. When the Old Faithful Inn first opened in the spring of 1904, it boasted electric lights and steam heat.

The structure is the largest log hotel in the world; possibly even the largest log building in the world. In 2007 the American Institute of Architects conducted a survey to determine the 150 favorite buildings in America; the Old Faithful Inn ranked 36. The Inn, which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987, is itself part of the Old Faithful Historic District. Old Faithful Inn is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

==Design==
The inn&#x27;s architect was 29-year-old Robert Reamer, an architect for the Yellowstone Park Company, which was affiliated with the Northern Pacific Railway. Reamer was hired by Harry W. Child, the president of the Yellowstone Park Company, who had met Reamer in San Diego through mutual acquaintances. Reamer designed the lobby and the initial phase of guest rooms, known as the Old House, which was built in 1903–1904, much of it in the long winter. The east wing was extended in 1913–14, and the west wing in 1927, creating a single structure almost long. The Old House is rotated 90 degrees with respect to Old Faithful so that a view of the geyser is framed by the entrance porch for arriving visitors. The porch roof provides a viewing platform for viewing eruptions of Old Faithful and other geysers, while the main facade faces Geyser Hill across the Firehole River, where the old Circuit Road once ran through the geyser basin.

The central feature of the Old House is a tall gabled log structure housing the lobby, dominated by a deep, steeply-pitching shingled roof. The Old House uses load-bearing log lower exterior walls with a log pole interior framework supporting seven stories, six of which are the roof structure. The upper gable walls are of milled lumber framing with shingle sheathing. The front slope of the shingled roof is accented by shed and gabled dormers, some of which are purely decorative. Both interior and exterior framing is supported by twisted or curved branches, giving the entire structure a strongly rustic air. There are two levels of balconies, the lower encircling the lobby and the upper on two sides. Stairs climb from the second balcony to a platform in the framing known as the &quot;Crow&#x27;s Nest&quot; which once was used by musicians to entertain guests, then on to the crown of the gable above the lobby floor. The entire structure is crowned by a roof walk that once held searchlights to illuminate Old Faithful Geyser at night. The original guest wings are stories tall on either side of the lobby. It is anchored to the ground by a rhyolite foundation that extends to the first floor window sills.

Offset to the southeast corner, the stone fireplace measures square at the base. It features four main hearths, one on each face, with smaller hearths, each with a flue, at the corners. The stone extends to the roof, and until it was damaged by earthquake, a brick flue extended above the roof, covered in log cribbing. An ironwork clock decorates the north face of the upper chimney in the lobby. The fireplace is centered in a shallow depression in the lobby floor that sets the area around its hearths apart from the rest of the lobby. Custom ironwork, most notable in the main entrance door and the clock, was forged at the site by an ironmonger named Colpitts.

The dining room extends to the south of the lobby, with log scissors trusses supporting a more shallowly-pitched roof at right angles to the lobby roof. The dining room has its own stone fireplace, less massive than the lobby&#x27;s, but still large. The Old House guest rooms retain much of their original character.

The east and west wings were purposely designed by Reamer to be less prominent than the central house. The wings are three to four stories in height with a mansarded top floor and a flat roof. The east wing is straight, originally with 100 rooms. The west wing is Y-shaped, with 150 guest rooms as built. The interiors of the wings are unremarkable compared with the Old House.

==History==
The Old Faithful Inn replaced the Upper Geyser Basin Hotel, also known as the &quot;Shack Hotel&quot;, which had burned down. The Northern Pacific Railroad, in the form of the Yellowstone Park Association operating company, was required by the terms of its concession to build a new hotel no closer than 1/8 mile of Old Faithful, a stipulation the Yellowstone Park Association observed to the letter. An initial design was prepared by architect A.W. Spalding in 1898, producing a design typical of the time, a turreted Queen Anne style hotel. The design was approved by the Park Service, but construction never started. Child instead hired Reamer to design a much more radical building with antecedents in the rustic camps of the Adirondacks. Design work took place in 1902, and construction started in 1903, with work continuing through the winter to open in 1904. The original cost of the Inn was about $140,000, using materials gathered from within the park. The hotel was furnished for another $25,000. Most of the logs came from a location about south of Old Faithful, where a temporary sawmill produced boards as needed. Stone came from the Black Sand Basin and from a site along the road to Craig Pass about to the east. The unusually-shaped log brackets were collected from the surrounding forests.
The Inn has been expanded and modified several times. In 1913 the East Wing was added to the 120-room original structure, and in 1922 the dining room was enlarged. In 1927–1928, the West Wing was built, and the front of the main building extended. All of these modifications were carried out under the supervision of the original architect, Robert Reamer. A 1927 addition to the dining room has since become home to the Bear Pit Lounge. Installed in 1936 just off the lobby, the first Bear Pit featured carved and inlaid wood panels with humorous scenes involving bears, created at Reamer&#x27;s suggestion. When the lounge was converted to a coffee shop, the lounge was relocated to the dining room extension and the panels were replicated in etched glass in 1988. Some of the original panels remain in the snack bar. In 1940 the interior logs were peeled, revealing patterns created by bark beetles, and in 1966 the logs were cleaned and varnished. An automatic fire sprinkler system was added in 1948, together with fire doors in the wings.

Some of the original furnishings remain, while care has been taken with newer pieces to remain compatible with the rustic design. Some furniture at the Old Faithful Inn was salvaged from the Canyon Hotel before it was demolished, particularly the Limbert chairs in the dining room extension and some of the reading desks on the balcony.

The facility was closed for the duration of the Second World War (along with all other hotels in the park) and the park was unprepared for the huge number of visitors in 1946.

Late on August 17, 1959, the Old Faithful Inn was shaken by the Hebgen Lake earthquake, which collapsed the dining room fireplace chimney and damaged the huge lobby fireplace, reducing the number of usable hearths from eight to two. The building was partially shaken loose from its foundations, and access to some of the upper levels had to be restricted due to safety concerns. There were no deaths or serious injuries at the Inn as a result of the earthquake. The dining room fireplace was finally rebuilt in 1985, but the outside portion of the lobby fireplace chimney was replaced with a single steel pipe, visible in many exterior photos.
In 1988, the inn was threatened by the North Fork Fire, in which approximately 36 percent of the park was affected. It was saved by the actions of firefighters, volunteers, and a rooftop sprinkler system installed the previous year.

The high-range rooms in the East and West wing additions were renovated in 1993 and 1994. In celebration of the Inn&#x27;s centennial in 2004, a major renovation project of the original &quot;Old House&quot; started construction, with completion in 2008. The project brought the Inn to current building codes and installed new electrical, plumbing, and heating systems, as well as structural upgrades. Finishes were cleaned and restored, maintaining as much of the historic material as possible. Wood and wool floor finishes, bathroom tile and fixtures, new replica historic hardware, and an interpretation of the original lavatory stands and basins by Charles Limbert were installed. Original elements including the recessing of the floor and hearth of the large fireplace in the main lobby and reconstruction of log walls removed in the lobby corrected modifications and changes over the years and brought the Inn back to match more closely Reamer&#x27;s original design.

===Presidential visitors===
Its notable visitors are numerous, even preceding its construction. Chester A. Arthur camped outside the East Wing area in 1883, Theodore Roosevelt visited the site in 1903, Warren Harding stayed in 1923, Calvin Coolidge in 1927, and Franklin Roosevelt in the fall of 1937.

===Christmas in August===
According to park lore, a freak blizzard struck the Old Faithful Inn on August 25 sometime in the early twentieth century. Rather than lament the fact that they were isolated, the guests were said to have taken the opportunity to celebrate Christmas in August.

==In popular culture==
* The Old Faithful Inn was featured in the 1936 film &quot;Yellowstone&quot;.

==Influences==
The Old Faithful Inn had a pronounced effect on the built environment in North American national parks, influencing the development of the National Park Service Rustic style that became widespread during the 1920s. Although it was not the first hotel with a multi-story lobby, the concept became widespread in the mid-20th century in urban hotels. In 2007 the Old Faithful Inn was selected as number 36 on a list of the 150 favorite buildings in the United States in a poll by the American Institute of Architects.

==Historic designations==
The Old Faithful Inn was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 23, 1973. It was designated a National Historic Landmark on May 28, 1987. It is the central element in the Old Faithful Historic District, which includes the Old Faithful Lodge on the other side of Old Faithful. The Lodge, which was designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood to provide dining and guest services to a community of tent cabins, is lower and more understated in nature, but compatibly rustic.

<text>Shame is an unpleasant self-conscious emotion often associated with negative self-evaluation; motivation to quit; and feelings of pain, exposure, distrust, powerlessness, and worthlessness.

== Definition ==

Shame is a discrete, basic emotion, described as a moral or social emotion that drives people to hide or deny their wrongdoings.
Moral emotions are emotions that have an influence on a person&#x27;s decision-making skills and monitors different social behaviors. The focus of shame is on the self or the individual with respect to a perceived audience. It can bring about profound feelings of deficiency, defeat, inferiority, unworthiness, or self-loathing. Our attention turns inward; we isolate from our surroundings and withdraw into closed-off self-absorption. Not only do we feel alienated from others but also from the healthy parts of ourselves. The alienation from the world leads to painful emotions and self-deprecating thoughts and inner anguish.
Empirical research demonstrates that it is dysfunctional for the individual and group level. Shame can also be described as an unpleasant self-conscious emotion that involves negative evaluation of the self. Shame can be a painful emotion that is seen as a &quot;...comparison of the self&#x27;s action with the self&#x27;s standards...&quot; but may equally stem from comparison of the self&#x27;s state of being with the ideal social context&#x27;s standard. According to Neda Sedighimornani, shame is relevant in several psychological disorders such as depression, phobia of social interactions, and even some eating disorders.
Some scales of shame measure it to assess emotional states, whereas other shame scales are used to assess emotional traits or dispositions- shame proneness. &quot;To shame&quot; generally means to actively assign or communicate a state of shame to another person. Behaviors designed to &quot;uncover&quot; or &quot;expose&quot; others are sometimes used to place shame on the other person. Whereas, having shame means to maintain a sense of restraint against offending others (as with modesty, humility, and deference). In contrast to having shame is to have no shame; behaving without restraint, offending others, similar to other emotions like pride or hubris.

== Identification and self-evaluation ==
Nineteenth-century scientist Charles Darwin described shame affect in the physical form of blushing, confusion of mind, downward cast eyes, slack posture, and lowered head; Darwin noted these observations of shame affect in human populations worldwide, as mentioned in his book &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot;. Darwin also mentions how the sense of warmth or heat, associated with the vasodilation of the face and skin, can result in an even greater sense of shame. More commonly, the act of crying can be associated with shame.

When people feel shame, the focus of their evaluation is on the self or identity. Shame is a self-punishing acknowledgment of something gone wrong. It is associated with &quot;mental undoing&quot;. Studies of shame showed that when ashamed people feel that their entire self is worthless, powerless, and small, they also feel exposed to an audience—real or imagined—that exists purely for the purpose of confirming that the self is worthless. Shame and the sense of self is stigmatized, or treated unfairly, like being overtly rejected by parents in favor of siblings&#x27; needs, and is assigned externally by others regardless of one&#x27;s own experience or awareness. An individual who is in a state of shame will assign the shame internally from being a victim of the environment, and the same is assigned externally, or assigned by others regardless of one&#x27;s own experience or awareness.

A &quot;sense of shame&quot; is the feeling known as guilt but &quot;consciousness&quot; or awareness of &quot;shame as a state&quot; or condition defines core/toxic shame (Lewis, 1971; Tangney, 1998). The person experiencing shame might not be able to, or perhaps simply will not, identify their emotional state as shame, and there is an intrinsic connection between shame and the mechanism of denial. &quot; The key emotion in all forms of shame is contempt (Miller, 1984; Tomkins, 1967). Two realms in which shame is expressed are the &quot;consciousness of self as bad&quot; and &quot;self as inadequate&quot;. People employ negative coping responses to counter deep rooted, associated sense of &quot;shameworthiness&quot;. The shame cognition may occur as a result of the experience of shame affect or, more generally, in any situation of embarrassment, dishonor, disgrace, inadequacy, humiliation, or .

The dynamics of shame and devaluation appear to be consistent across cultures. This has led some researchers to propose the existence of a universal human psychology related to how we assign value and worth. This applies both to us and to others. 

=== Behavioural expression ===
Physiological symptoms caused by the autonomic nervous system include blushing, perspiration, dizziness, or nausea. A feeling of paralysis, numbness, or loss of muscle tone might set in making it difficult to think, act, or talk. Children often visibly slump and hang their head. In an effort to hide this reaction, adults are more likely to laugh, stare, avoid eye contact, freeze their face, tighten their jaw, or show a look of contempt. In another&#x27;s presence, there&#x27;s a feeling of being strange, naked, transparent, or exposed, as if wanting to disappear or hide.
The Shame Code was developed to capture behavior as it unfolds in real time during the socially stressful and potentially shaming spontaneous speech task and was coded into the following categories: (1) Body Tension, (2) Facial Tension, (3) Stillness, (4) Fidgeting, (5) Nervous Positive Affect, (6) Hiding and Avoiding, (7) Verbal Flow and Uncertainty, and (8) Silence. Shame tendencies were associated with more fidgeting and less freezing, but both stillness and fidgeting were social cues that convey distress to the observer and may elicit less harsh responses. Thus, both may be an attempt to diminish further shaming experiences. Shame involves global, self-focused negative attributions based on the anticipated, imagined, or real negative evaluations of others and is accompanied by a powerful urge to hide, withdraw, or escape from the source of these evaluations. These negative evaluations arise from transgressions of standards, rules, or goals and cause the individual to feel separate from the group for which these standards, rules, or goals exist, resulting in one of the most powerful, painful, and potentially destructive experiences known to humans.

== Comparison with other emotions ==
Distinguishing between shame, guilt, and embarrassment can be challenging. They are all similar reactions or emotions in the fact that they are self-conscious, &quot;implying self-reflection and self-evaluation.&quot;

=== Comparison with guilt ===
According to cultural anthropologist Ruth Benedict, shame arises from a violation of cultural or social values while guilt feelings arise from violations of one&#x27;s internal values. Thus shame arises when one&#x27;s &#x27;defects&#x27; are exposed to others, and results from the negative evaluation (whether real or imagined) of others; guilt, on the other hand, comes from one&#x27;s own negative evaluation of oneself, for instance, when one acts contrary to one&#x27;s values or idea of one&#x27;s self. Shame is more attributed to internal characteristics and guilt is more attributed to behavioral characteristics. Thus, it might be possible to feel ashamed of thought or behavior that no one actually knows about (because one is afraid of what they find), and conversely, feeling guilty about the act of gaining approval from others.

Psychoanalyst Helen B. Lewis argued that, &quot;The experience of shame is directly about the self, which is the focus of evaluation. In guilt, the self is not the central object of negative evaluation, but rather the thing done is the focus.&quot; Similarly, Fossum and Mason say in their book &quot;Facing Shame&quot; that &quot;While guilt is a painful feeling of regret and responsibility for one&#x27;s actions, shame is a painful feeling about oneself as a person.&quot;

Following this line of reasoning, Psychiatrist Judith Lewis Herman concludes that &quot;Shame is an acutely self-conscious state in which the self is &#x27;split,&#x27; imagining the self in the eyes of the other; by contrast, in guilt the self is unified.&quot;

Clinical psychologist Gershen Kaufman&#x27;s view of shame is derived from that of affect theory, namely that shame is one of a set of instinctual, short-duration physiological reactions to stimulation. In this view, guilt is seen as a learned behavior consisting primarily of self-directed blame or contempt, and the shame that results from this behavior, making up a part of the overall experience of guilt. Here, self-blame and self-contempt mean the application, towards (a part of) one&#x27;s self, of exactly the same dynamic that blaming of, and contempt for, others represents when it is applied interpersonally.

Kaufman saw that mechanisms such as blame or contempt may be used as a defending strategy against the experience of shame and that someone who has a pattern of applying them to himself may well attempt to defend against a shame experience by applying self-blame or self-contempt. This, however, can lead to an internalized, self-reinforcing sequence of shame events for which Kaufman coined the term &quot;shame spiral&quot;. Shame can also be used as a strategy when feeling guilty, especially when the hope is to avoid punishment by inspiring compassion.

=== Comparison with embarrassment ===

One view of difference between shame and embarrassment says that shame does not necessarily involve public humiliation while embarrassment does; that is, one can feel shame for an act known only to oneself but to be embarrassed one&#x27;s actions must be revealed to others. In the field of ethics (moral psychology, in particular), however, there is debate as to whether or not shame is a heteronomous emotion, i.e., whether or not shame does involve recognition on the part of the ashamed that they have been judged negatively by others.

Another view of the dividing line between shame and embarrassment holds that the difference is one of intensity. In this view embarrassment is simply a less intense experience of shame. It is adaptive and functional. Extreme or toxic shame is a much more intense experience and one that is not functional. In fact, according to this view, toxic shame can be debilitating. The dividing line then is between functional and dysfunctional shame. This includes the idea that shame has a function or benefit for the organism.

Immanuel Kant and his followers held that shame is heteronomous (comes from others); Bernard Williams and others have argued that shame can be autonomous (comes from oneself). Shame may carry the connotation of a response to something that is morally wrong whereas embarrassment is the response to something that is morally neutral but socially unacceptable. Another view of shame and guilt is that shame is a focus on self, while guilt is a focus on behavior. Simply put: A person who feels guilt is saying &quot;I did something bad.&quot;, while someone who feels shame is saying &quot;I am bad&quot;.

Embarrassment has occasionally been viewed as a less severe or intense form of shame, which usually varies on different aspects such as intensity, the physical reaction of the person, or the size of the present social audience, but it is distinct from shame in that it involves a focus on the self-presented to an audience rather than the entire self. It is experienced as a sense of fluster and slight mortification resulting from a social awkwardness that leads to a loss of esteem in the eyes of others. Embarrassment has been characterized as a sudden-onset sense of fluster and mortification that results when the self is evaluated negatively because one has committed, or anticipates committing, a gaffe or awkward performance before an audience. So, because shame is focused on the entire self, those who become embarrassed apologize for their mistake, and then begin to repair things and this repair involves redressing harm done to the presented self.

One view of difference between shame and embarrassment says that shame does not necessarily involve public humiliation while embarrassment does; that is, one can feel shame for an act known only to oneself but to be embarrassed one&#x27;s actions must be revealed to others. Therefore shame can only be experienced in private and embarrassment can never be experienced in private. In the field of ethics (moral psychology, in particular), however, there is debate as to whether or not shame is a heteronomous emotion, i.e. whether or not shame does involve recognition on the part of the ashamed that they have been judged negatively by others. This is a mature heteronomous type of shame where the agent does not judge herself negatively, but, due to the negative judgments of others, suspects that she may deserve negative judgment, and feel shame on this basis. Therefore, shame may carry the connotation of a response to something that is morally wrong whereas embarrassment is the response to something that is morally neutral but socially unacceptable.

== Subtypes of shame ==
=== Robert Karen&#x27;s types of shame ===
Psychologist Robert Karen identified four categories of shame: existential, situational, class, and narcissistic. Existential shame occurs when we become self-aware of an objective, unpleasant truth about
ourselves or our situation. Situational shame is the feeling we have when violating an ethical principle, interpersonal boundary, or cultural norm. Class shame relates to social power and pertains to skin color, social class, ethnic background, and gender and occurs in societies that have rigid caste stratifications or disparate classes. Narcissistic shame occurs when our self-image and pride are wounded, affecting how we feel and think about ourselves as an individual, in contrast as a member of a group.

=== Joseph Burgo&#x27;s shame paradigms ===
There are many different reasons that people might feel shame. According to Joseph Burgo, there are four different aspects of shame. He calls these aspects of shame paradigms.
* Unrequited love: &quot;Unreciprocated love that causes yearning for more complete love.&quot;
* Unwanted exposure: Something personal that we would like to keep private is unexpectedly revealed, or when we make a mistake in [a] public [setting].&quot;
* Disappointed expectation: &quot;The feeling of dissatisfaction that follows the failure of expectations or hopes to manifest.&quot;
* Exclusion: Being left out of connection or involvement with others or groups that we would like to belong to.

In his first subdivision of shame he looks into is unrequited love; which is when you love someone but your partner does not reciprocate, or one is rejected by somebody that they like; this can be mortifying and shaming. Unrequited love can be shown in other ways as well. For example, the way a mother treats her new born baby. An experiment called &quot;The Still Face Experiment&quot; was done where a mother showed her baby love and talked to the baby for a set period of time. She then went a few minutes without talking to the baby. This resulted with the baby making different expressions to get the mother&#x27;s attention. When the mother stopped giving the baby attention, the baby felt shame. According to research on unrequited love, people tend to date others who are similar in attractiveness, leaving those less attractive to feel an initial disappointment that creates a type of unrequited love in the person. The second type of shame is unwanted exposure. This would take place if you were called out in front of a whole class for doing something wrong or if someone saw you doing something you did not want them to see. This is what you would normally think of when you hear the word shame. Disappointed expectation would be your third type of shame according to Burgo. This could be not passing a class, having a friendship go wrong, or not getting a big promotion in a job that you thought you would get. The fourth and final type of shame according to Burgo is exclusion which also means being left out. Many people will do anything to just fit in or want to belong in society, e.g., at school, work, friendships, relationships, everywhere.

=== Other subtypes ===
* Addiction shaming
* Age shaming
* Bottom shaming
* Genuine shame: is associated with genuine dishonor, disgrace, or condemnation.
* False shame: is associated with false condemnation as in the double bind form of false shaming; &quot;he brought what we did to him upon himself&quot;. Author and TV personality John Bradshaw calls shame the &quot;emotion that lets us know we are finite&quot;.
* Fat shaming
* Femme shaming&#x27;
* Food shaming
* Secret shame: describes the idea of being ashamed to be ashamed, so causing ashamed people to keep their shame a secret. Psychiatrist James Gilligan discovered, while working as a prison psychiatrist, that violence is primarily caused by secret shame. Gilligan stated, &quot;...so intense and so painful that it threatens to overwhelm him and bring about the death of the self, cause him to lose his mind, his soul, or his sacred honor&quot;
* Internalized shame: Internalization of shame was first coined by Gershen Kaufman. In contrast to an acute short-lived experience of shame, internalized shame reflects deep-seated beliefs of inadequacy that feel permanent and irreversible and are accompanied by words, voices, and images. Internalized shame stems from chronic or less frequent severe experiences of shame occurring with prior trauma or in childhood. It can take over a child&#x27;s emotions and identity and continue into adulthood or may gradually increase over time. Once internalized, the original shaming event(s) and beliefs need not be recalled nor be conscious. Later experiences of shame are intensified and last longer. They do not require an external event or another person to trigger associated feelings and thoughts and can cause depression and feelings of hopelessness and despair. It also causes &quot;shame anxiety,&quot; which makes people apprehensive about experiencing shame.
* Identity Shaming
* Kink shaming
* Online shaming
* Social media shaming
* Slut-shaming
* Tech shame: describes the shame that employees, particularly younger workers, feel when they have challenges utilizing technology at work.
* Toxic shame: describes false, pathological shame. It was coined by Sylvan Tomkins in the early 60s. John Bradshaw states that toxic shame is induced, inside children, by all forms of child abuse. Incest and other forms of child sexual abuse can cause particularly severe toxic shame. Toxic shame often induces what is known as &quot;complex&quot; trauma in children who cannot cope with toxic shaming as it occurs and who dissociate the shame until it is possible to cope with.
* Vicarious shame: refers to the experience of shame on behalf of another person. Individuals vary in their tendency to experience vicarious shame, which is related to neuroticism and to the tendency to experience personal shame. Extremely shame-prone people might even experience vicarious shame even to an increased degree, in other words: shame on behalf of another person who is already feeling shame on behalf of a third party (or possibly on behalf of the individual proper).
* Victim shaming

== Shame and mental illness ==

=== Narcissism ===
It has been suggested that narcissism in adults is related to defenses against shame and that narcissistic personality disorder is connected to shame as well. According to psychiatrist Glen Gabbard, NPD can be broken down into two subtypes, a grandiose, arrogant, thick-skinned &quot;oblivious&quot; subtype and an easily hurt, oversensitive, ashamed &quot;hypervigilant&quot; subtype. The oblivious subtype presents for admiration, envy, and appreciation a grandiose self that is the antithesis of a weak internalized self which hides in shame, while the hypervigilant subtype neutralizes devaluation by seeing others as unjust abusers.

=== Depression ===
Another form of mental illness where shame is one of the most notable symptoms is depression. In a meta-analytic review performed in 2011, it was found that there were stronger associations with shame and depression than with guilt and depression. External shame, or a negative view of the self, seen through other people, had larger effect sizes correlated with depression than did internal shame. There are different degrees or levels of symptoms of shame in depression depending on different cultures. Those who show greater symptoms of shame in depression usually live in more socio-economic cultures.

== Social aspects ==

According to the anthropologist Ruth Benedict, cultures may be classified by their emphasis on the use of either shame (a shame society) or guilt to regulate the social activities of individuals.

Shame may be used by those people who commit relational aggression and may occur in the workplace as a form of overt social control or aggression. Shaming is used in some societies as a type of punishment, shunning, or ostracism. In this sense, &quot;the real purpose of shaming is not to punish crimes but to create the kind of people who don&#x27;t commit them&quot;.

=== Stigma ===

In 1963, Erving Goffman published &quot;&quot;. For Goffman, the condition when a particular person is excluded from full societal reception is greatly discrediting. This negative evaluation may be &quot;felt&quot; or &quot;enacted&quot;. Thus, stigma can occur when society labels someone as tainted, less desirable, or handicapped. When felt, it refers to the shame associated with having a condition and the fear of being discriminated against... when enacted it refers to actual discrimination of this kind. Shame in relation to stigma studies have most often come from the sense and mental consequences that young adolescents find themselves trapped in when they are deciding to use a condom in STD or HIV protection. The other use of stigma and shame is when someone has a disease, such as cancer, where people look to blame something for their feelings of shame and circumstance of sickness. Jessica M. Sales et al. researched young adolescents ages 15–21 on whether they had used protection in the 14 days prior to coming in for the study. The answers showed implications of shame and stigma, which received an accommodating score. The scores, prior history of STDs, demographics, and psychosocial variables were put into a hierarchical regression model to determine probability of an adolescents chances of using protected sex in the future. The study found that the higher sense of shame and stigma the higher chance the adolescent would use protection in the future. This means that if a person is more aware of consequences, is more in-tune with themselves and the stigma (stereotypes, disgrace, etc.), they will be more likely to protect themselves. The study shows that placing more shame and stigma in the mind of people can be more prone to protecting themselves from the consequences that follow the action of unprotected sex.

HIV-related stigma from those who are born with HIV due to their maternal genetics have a proneness to shame and avoidant coping. David S. Bennett et al. studied the ages 12–24 of self-reported measures of potential risk factors and three domains of internalizing factors: depression, anxiety, and PTSD. The findings suggested that those who had more shame-proneness and more awareness of HIV-stigma had a greater amount of depressive and PTSD symptoms. This means that those who have high HIV-stigma and shame do not seek help from interventions. Rather, they avoid the situation that could cause them to find themselves in a predicament of other mental health issues. Older age was related to greater HIV-related stigma and the female gender was more related to stigma and internalizing symptoms (depression, anxiety, PTSD). Stigma was also associated with greater shame-proneness.

Chapple et al. researched people with lung cancer in regards to the shame and stigma that comes from the disease. The stigma that accompanies lung cancer is most commonly caused by smoking. However, there are many ways to contract lung cancer, therefore those who did not receive lung cancer from smoking often feel shame; blaming themselves for something they did not do. The stigma effects their opinions of themselves, while shame is found to blame other cancer causing factors (tobacco products/anti-tobacco products) or ignoring the disease in avoidant coping altogether. The stigma associated with lung cancer effected relationships of patients with their family members, peers, and physicians who were attempting to provide comfort because the patients felt shame and victimized themselves.

=== Shame campaign ===
A shame campaign is a tactic in which particular individuals are singled out because of their behavior or suspected crimes, often by marking them publicly, such as Hester Prynne in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;. In the Philippines, Alfredo Lim popularized such tactics during his term as mayor of Manila. On July 1, 1997, he began a controversial &quot;spray paint shame campaign&quot; in an effort to stop drug use. He and his team sprayed bright red paint on two hundred squatter houses whose residents had been charged, but not yet convicted, of selling prohibited substances. Officials of other municipalities followed suit. Former Senator Rene A. Saguisag condemned Lim&#x27;s policy. Communists in the 20th century used struggle sessions to handle corruption and other problems.

Public humiliation, historically expressed by confinement in stocks and in other public punishments may occur in social media through viral phenomena.

== Research ==
Psychologists and other researchers who study shame use validated psychometric testing instruments to determine whether or how much a person feels shame. Some of these tools include the Guilt and Shame Proneness (GASP) Scale, the Shame and Stigma Scale (SSS), the Experience of Shame Scale, and the Internalized Shame Scale. Some scales are specific to the person&#x27;s situation, such as the Weight- and Body-Related Shame and Guilt scale (WEB-SG), the HIV Stigma Scale for people living with HIV and the Cataldo Lung Cancer Stigma Scale (CLCSS) for people with lung cancer. Others are more general, such as the Emotional Reactions and Thoughts Scale, which deals with anxiety, depression, and guilt as well as shame.

=== Treatments ===
There has been little research performed on treatment options concerning shame and people who experience this negative, despairing emotion. Different scientific approaches concerning a treatment have been put forward, using components of psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral precepts. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these approaches is not known because the studies have not been run or looked at in depth. An example of treatment for shame consists of group-based CBT and Compassion Focused Therapy, which patients report have helped them feel connectedness and encouraged to overcome difficult challenges related to shame. 

==== Empathy ====
Brene Brown explains that shame (using a metaphor of a petri-dish) only needs three things to grow: secrecy, silence, and judgement. Shame cannot grow or thrive, in the context (or supportive environment) of empathy. It is important, that when reaching out for a supportive or empathetic person (i.e. when reaching out to share a story or experience): that we choose the people who have &quot;earned the right&quot; to hear our story (i.e. someone trustworthy); share with people with whom we have a relationship that can bear the weight of the story.

<text>Live with Kelly and Mark (or simply Live) is an American syndicated morning talk show hosted by Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos. Executive produced by Michael Gelman, the &quot;Live with...&quot; show formula has aired under various hosts since 1983 locally on WABC-TV in New York City and 1988 nationwide. , it is produced by WABC.

With roots in &quot;A.M. Los Angeles&quot; and &quot;A.M. New York&quot;, &quot;Live&quot; began as &quot;The Morning Show&quot;, hosted by Regis Philbin and Cyndy Garvey; the show rose to national prominence as &quot;Live with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot; when Philbin was joined by Kathie Lee Gifford. The franchise has had longstanding success and has won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show and Outstanding Talk Show Hosts. Since April 2023, the show has been hosted by Ripa and her husband, Mark Consuelos. Prior to Consuelos, Ripa previously co-hosted the show with Philbin, Michael Strahan, and Ryan Seacrest.

==Production==
===Concept===
Executive producer Michael Gelman said in 1993, &quot;The real concept of the show, in a symbolic sense, is that they are husband and wife. They have their coffee mugs and they&#x27;re chit-chatting about what&#x27;s going on.&quot; It is the basis of the show&#x27;s signature &quot;Host Chat&quot;, an unscripted on-air conversation between the co-hosts that opens each show. Following Host Chat is a trivia segment in which the show telephones a home viewer, who must answer a question (usually about a guest on a recent show) to win a vacation for themselves and a for a member of the studio audience. Shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic, the hosts started playing a new game with the contestant before the trivia question, wherein the caller gives the host two statements, one true and one false. If the hosts are stumped, the caller wins a &quot;Live with Kelly and Mark&quot; mug. The show then continues with interviews with celebrity guests, musical performances, and other recurring segments, including regular features showcasing fashion, food, health, and lifestyle topics.

The husband and wife breakfast chat program was popular in old time radio, beginning with Ed and Pegeen Fitzgerald, and later Dick Kollmar and Dorothy Kilgallen and Tex McCrary and Jinx Falkenburg. Parodied by Woody Allen in his film &quot;Radio Days&quot;, these programs were popular locally in New York, and Philbin would have heard them in his youth.

The format of &quot;Live!&quot; has been emulated by other successful talk shows such as the British programmes &quot;This Morning&quot; and &quot;Today with Des and Mel&quot;. However, it has also proven to be resilient against similarly formatted talk shows from other syndicators or networks, seeing programs such as &quot;George &amp; Alana&quot;, &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot;, &quot;Living It Up! with Ali &amp; Jack&quot;, &quot;The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet&quot;, and &quot;Anderson Live&quot; all launch and end in short periods of time throughout its entire run, and fail to make any headway in the traditional 9 a.m. local time slot &quot;Live!&quot; has been traditionally slotted in for most markets.

The show is broadcast live from New York City, on weekdays at 9 a.m. for stations in the Eastern Time Zone, and is tape-delayed for the rest of the country. Most affiliates also rebroadcast &quot;Live&quot; during the overnight hours. Although the program is generally associated with the ABC network and airs on all ABC owned-and-operated stations, in many markets the program is syndicated to stations affiliated with other networks. &quot;Live&quot; did not air in a morning timeslot on all ABC-owned stations until September 2013, as WLS-TV in Chicago programmed the 9 a.m. timeslot with &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;---WLS-TV was the originating station for Oprah in the 1980s---and then with &quot;Windy City Live&quot; after &quot;Oprah&quot; concluded its run in 2011. Although WLS-TV had carried the New York-based &quot;Live&quot; in an overnight timeslot earlier in its run, the show aired on other Chicago stations, including WGN-TV from 2002 through 2013.

===Recurring segments===
Guinness World Record Breaker Week, New York Auto Show Week, Broadway Week, and Top Teacher Week are examples of features frequently visited on the show, highlighting a different aspect of the theme everyday that week. &quot;Live&quot; will also invite &quot;whiz kids&quot; to oppose the co-hosts at spelling, athletics, mathematics, sport stacking, and technology, among other tasks. A recurring gag with Philbin as co-host was him challenging seniors—preferably over the age of 100—at tennis, basketball, ping-pong, and bowling, for example. Regular contributors to the show include toy enthusiast Chris Byrne, style maven Lawrence Zarian, animal expert Peter Gros, automotive expert Alan Taylor, pediatrician Greg Yapalater, home and gardening show host Katie Brown, technology specialist Leo Laporte, entrepreneur Carley Roney, Science Bob, veterinarian Jennifer Jellison, and nutrition expert Wendy Bazilian.

===Specials===
The show has hosted a number of specials over the years since it began. Specials have included a Halloween celebration in which the co-hosts wore dozens of costumes and portrayed some of the most famous and infamous names in pop culture.

In February 2011, &quot;Live&quot; threw a wedding for a couple who wrote in with reasons why they should be married on the show. Viewer submissions have also been accepted for their &quot;Moms Dream Come True Special&quot;, where the co-hosts pay tribute to a select group of mothers. The show has aired a Post-Oscar special the day after the awards ceremony live from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.

===On location===
&quot;Live&quot; has been to eight countries and nearly 25 states, logging . The list of remotes includes Tampa, Hawaii, Monaco, Banff, San Antonio, Aspen, Walt Disney World, New Orleans, Disneyland, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Paris, Detroit, Chicago, The Bronx, Los Angeles, the USS &quot;Intrepid&quot;, Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Maui, Prince Edward Island, London, Scottsdale, the White House, Charlotte, Churchill Downs, Niagara Falls, Puerto Rico, Marina del Rey, Philadelphia, Branson, Mount Rushmore, The Bahamas, and the Dolby Theatre&#x27;s set for the 85th Academy Awards.

==History==
===Co-host timeline===


===1983–1988: &quot;The Morning Show&quot;===
&quot;The Morning Show&quot;, co-hosted by Regis Philbin and Cyndy Garvey, premiered locally on WABC-TV in New York on April 4, 1983. In 1984, Garvey left the show and Philbin hired Ann Abernathy, whom he remembered from his time at KABC for her engaging personality, to assume the co-host duties. After Abernathy got married and decided to return to Los Angeles, Kathie Lee Johnson (later Gifford) joined Philbin officially on June 24, 1985. Their chemistry proved to be successful as &quot;The Morning Show&quot; soon became number 1 in the market and went on to debut in national syndication on September 5, 1988, when the title was changed to &quot;Live with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot;.
===1988–2000: &quot;Live with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot;===
Early on, &quot;Live&quot; matched its local success with impressive national ratings and established itself as a dominant fixture in American television. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford as &quot;an agreeable mismatch&quot; and their famous banter as &quot;playful, edgy, and amusing.&quot; Gifford&#x27;s positivity throughout public scandals such as the 1996 accusation that her clothing line was being run under sweatshop conditions and her husband Frank Gifford&#x27;s 1997 affair with a flight attendant resonated with the female demographic of the show, but ultimately made her a media target prompting her emotional departure on July 28, 2000. &quot;Over a third of my life has been [at &quot;Live&quot;],&quot; she said. &quot;This is family. It is been an amazing journey.&quot; Gifford appeared on &quot;Live! with Regis and Kelly&quot; on three occasions, for the show&#x27;s 20th Anniversary special on September 14, 2007, to promote her book &quot;Just When I Thought I&#x27;d Dropped My Last Egg: Life and Other Calamities&quot; on April 14, 2009, and again as a guest to bid farewell to Philbin on his second to last show, November 17, 2011. Gifford went on to host the fourth hour of &quot;Today&quot; with Hoda Kotb; that show mainly airs an hour after &quot;Live!&quot; in most markets, though a few markets where both shows air at 10:00 a.m. against each other do exist.

===2000–2001: &quot;Live with Regis&quot;===
When looking for Gifford&#x27;s replacement, Philbin and executive producer Michael Gelman teamed Philbin with a handful of potential co-hosts, including Joy Philbin, Kathleen Murphy, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, Jann Carl, Whoopi Goldberg, Kathy Fountain, Gloria Estefan, Jillian Reynolds, Lisa Rinna, Caroline Rhea, and Suzanne Sena. This met with positive fan response and a 26 percent ratings increase. Philbin won his first Daytime Emmy Award for &quot;Live&quot; during this period. Ripa auditioned four months into the search, on November 1, 2000. Three months later, on the morning of February 5, 2001, Philbin officially announced that Ripa would replace Gifford as his new permanent co-host.

===2001–2011: &quot;Live! with Regis and Kelly&quot;===
Ripa&#x27;s co-hosting duties began the following week, on February 12, 2001. The young-audience demographic of &quot;Live! with Regis and Kelly&quot; increased by 80 percent, with Ripa credited by major outlets such as the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; for bringing a new life to the show (dubbed &quot;the Ripa effect&quot;). Seven months into Philbin&#x27;s and Ripa&#x27;s run, the September 11 attacks on the United States occurred, with coverage beginning twelve minutes before that day&#x27;s episode would have started. The show was pre-empted for a week following the attacks and returned September 18, 2001.

Together they hosted the annual Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade during this era. In 2009, when Philbin underwent hip surgery, Nick Cannon replaced him as the host for that year&#x27;s Christmas special. Ryan Seacrest also took Philbin&#x27;s place on occasion. Ripa later had a stress fracture, which made it necessary for her to host the show on crutches. At times Maria Menounos filled in for Ripa, who was elsewhere on assignment for the show.

Shortly after celebrating his and Ripa&#x27;s 10th anniversary together, Philbin announced on January 18, 2011, that he would leave &quot;Live!&quot;. The show then held a &quot;Regis Farewell Celebration Season&quot;, showcasing Philbin&#x27;s top moments from his 28 years on the program, 1983–2011. His final show aired November 18, 2011.

&quot;Live! with Regis and Kelly&quot; won two Daytime Emmy Awards during its run.

===2011–2012: &quot;Live! with Kelly&quot; (first era)===
After Philbin&#x27;s departure, the show was renamed &quot;Live! with Kelly&quot;. Joining Ripa were various co-hosts from broadcasting and entertainment. On November 21, 2011, Jerry Seinfeld was the first of 60 men and women to join Ripa at the co-host desk: Reggie Bush, Kyle MacLachlan, Russell Brand, Howie Mandel, Carl Edwards, Chris Harrison, Daniel Radcliffe, Michael Buckley, Michael Catherwood, Rob Lowe, Martin Short, Neil Patrick Harris, Peter Facinelli, Boomer Esiason, Ben Mulroney, Dan Abrams, Rob Thomas, David Duchovny, Pat Kiernan, Derek Hough, D. L.

In April 2012, &quot;Live!&quot; debuted a new set described as a &quot;contemporary downtown-style loft, spacious and yet maintaining the studio&#x27;s warmth and intimacy.&quot; It was the first major set re-design since the start of the show&#x27;s 10th season in national syndication (1997–98).

In July 2012, &quot;People&quot; magazine reported that Meyers, Groban, and Strahan were the top three contenders to replace Philbin.

===2012–2016: &quot;Live with Kelly and Michael&quot;===
On the September 4, 2012, episode, Michael Strahan made his 16th appearance on the show and was introduced as Ripa&#x27;s permanent co-host. The former New York Giants defensive end had begun his TV career on &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot;, a job he said he would keep even though it shoots in Los Angeles. The Ripa-Strahan chemistry proved to be successful. &quot;Live With Kelly &amp; Michael&quot; had been the No. 2 syndicated talk show averaging a 2.8 national rating over Strahan&#x27;s entire tenure while &quot;Live With Regis &amp; Kelly&quot; averaged a 2.6. &quot;Live With Kelly &amp; Michael&quot; brought in 268,000 more audience members daily, on average, than the show attracted during the end of the Philbin run. On January 19, 2016, the show was renewed through at least the 2019–2020 season.

On April 19, 2016, it was announced that Strahan would leave &quot;Live&quot; to join &quot;Good Morning America&quot; full-time. The decision was revealed to the program&#x27;s production staff just after that day&#x27;s broadcast of &quot;Live&quot;, and officially announced on the program by Strahan the following day. Ripa, however, was absent from that day&#x27;s episode, and ABC announced later in the day that &quot;Live&quot; would have guest co-hosts through April 25, 2016. Although speculated to have been a reaction to Strahan&#x27;s abrupt exit, an ABC staff member stated to &quot;Variety&quot; that Ripa&#x27;s sudden absence was a &quot;pre-scheduled vacation&quot;.

Ripa returned on April 26, 2016, using the opening of the episode to address the reception to Strahan&#x27;s exit, and ABC&#x27;s continued commitment to &quot;Live&quot; as a series. She said she was annoyed that ABC had not given her advance notice of negotiations to move Strahan to &quot;GMA&quot;. Strahan&#x27;s final episode on &quot;Live&quot; occurred on May 13, 2016, and featured several flashback moments from the four years that he co-hosted the show.

===2016–2017: &quot;Live with Kelly&quot; (second era)===
On May 16, 2016, Ripa began the second era of her &quot;Live&quot; career as a single host. Jimmy Kimmel joined her as her first guest co-host.

=== 2017–2023: &quot;Live with Kelly and Ryan&quot; ===
On May 1, 2017, it was announced that Ryan Seacrest would succeed Strahan as the new permanent co-host, after a yearlong syndicated co-host search. Seacrest also joined as an executive producer to the show.

On September 5, 2017, &quot;Live&quot; updated the show&#x27;s look with a new, modern logo, modifications to the studio, and a brand-new show opener.

In March 2020, the show began broadcasting remotely from the hosts&#x27; homes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During this period, Philbin died on July 25. On August 26, 2020, it was announced that the 33rd season would premiere on September 7, with the show returning to its New York City studio the next day. The premiere did not have a studio audience and the hosts were seated six feet apart. Beginning with the 2020–21 season, Disney Media Distribution began to authorize the show&#x27;s ABC affiliates to run the show a second time daily in an overnight timeslot, allowing late night viewers to watch the show or record it, even if it were pre-empted by breaking news.

=== 2023–present: &quot;Live with Kelly and Mark&quot; ===
On February 16, 2023, Seacrest announced that he would be leaving &quot;Live&quot; in spring 2023, primarily due to the travel, as his primary residence is in Los Angeles, while the show tapes in New York City. Mark Consuelos, husband of Ripa, was announced as Seacrest&#x27;s replacement. The final episode of &quot;Live with Kelly and Ryan&quot; aired on April 14, 2023. On April 17, the first episode of &quot;Live with Kelly and Mark&quot; premiered.

==Critical reception==
The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; gave the program a positive review: &quot;…When it comes to the amount and playfulness of morning talk, nothing beats &quot;Live&quot;.&quot; In 2001, 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2016 the show won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Hosts and in its 24th year, after 21 nominations, it won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show. In addition, its co-hosts have received two TV Guide Award nominations for Favorite Daytime Talk Show and multiple People&#x27;s Choice nominations for Favorite Talk Show Host.

According to daytime television ratings, viewership averages 5 million per episode, ranking #1 in all big markets, such as New York City, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Francisco, and Miami. Dominating its time periods, &quot;Live&quot; is the top-rated morning show and regularly the #1 syndicated talk show.

<text>The squonk is a mythical creature that is reputed to live in the hemlock forests of northern Pennsylvania in the United States.

Johnstown, Pennsylvania celebrates the Squonk at the Squonkapalooza in August.

==Origins==

The first written account of the squonk was from the 1910 book &quot;Fearsome Creatures of the Lumberwoods&quot;. His provenance was attested in the next written iteration, in the 1939 book &quot;Fearsome Critters.&quot; This book suggested that the creatures had migrated from deserts to swamps to finally settle in Pennsylvania. As logging camps were continuously moving in the early 20th century, this could explain their migration to Pennsylvania.

==Appearance and behavior==
Unlike many mythological creatures, the supposed physical characteristics of the squonk remain unchanged from the original written account, which states:
Later retellings included that squonks were slowest on moonlit nights as they try to avoid seeing their ugly appearance in any illuminated bodies of water. In addition to warts and moles, the creatures were given webbed toes on their left feet.

The given &quot;species&quot; taxonomy of the creature, &quot;Lacrimacorpus dissolvens&quot;, is made up of the Latin &quot;tear&quot;, &quot;body&quot;, and &quot;dissolve&quot;. These refer to its supposed ability to dissolve when captured.

==In scientific literature==
Some substances are stable in solution or some other &quot;wild&quot; form but cannot be isolated or captured without actually catalyzing their own polymerization or decomposition (&quot;dissolving in their own tears&quot;). For example, a molecule containing a carboxylic acid moiety and an acid labile moiety might be stable when initially prepared as the salt (e.g., barium prephenate) but unstable as the free acid (prephenic acid). These have been named &quot;chemical squonks&quot;.

==Recent Squonkings==
In 2025, squonk became a new sensation, becoming a meme phenomenon on social media platforms. It has become very popular with the Cryptocurrency crowd on the Solana blockchain. This recent surge in popularity seeks to immortalise squonk and bring attention to this little known mythical creature of the past.

<text>Osmania University is a collegiate public state university located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Mir Osman Ali Khan, the 7th Nizam of Hyderabad, issued a &quot;firman&quot; calling for its creation on 29 August 1917. It is the third oldest university in southern India, and the first to be established in the erstwhile Kingdom of Hyderabad. It was the first Indian university to use Urdu as a language of instruction, although with English as a compulsory subject. As of 2012, the university hosts 3,700 international students from more than 80 nations.

Osmania is one of the largest university systems in the world with over 300,000 students on its campuses and affiliated colleges. The Osmania Medical College was once a part of the Osmania University System. However, it is now under the supervision of Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences.

== History ==
In 1917, Sir Akbar Hydari, in a memorandum to the Education Minister, emphasized the need to establish a university in Hyderabad with Urdu as the medium of instruction, &quot;as it is the language of the widest currency in the state&quot;. On 26 April 1917, the Nizam of Hyderabad Mir Osman Ali Khan issued a firman to establish the Osmania University.

The university began functioning in 1918 in a building adjacent to the Nizam College at Basheerbagh. Arts and theology were the only two faculties offered, and the first batch consisted of 225 students and 25 faculty members.

The government invited Patrick Geddes and Edwin Jasper to set up a permanent campus of the university. Geddes surveyed prospective locations and presented his report in 1923. Jasper drew up the building plans and the Nizam laid the foundation stone for the campus on 5 July 1934. After Jasper left Hyderabad, the state architect Zain Yar Jung supervised the construction of the campus.

=== Post-Independence (1947-present) ===
After independence and the accession of Hyderabad State in 1948, the university fell under the purview of the state government. After the election of the first state government, the central government announced plans to convert Osmania University into a central university with Hindi as the medium of instructions. However, this led to protests and with pressure from the Mulki agitation, the plan was dropped. Eventually, English replaced Urdu as the medium of instruction, and the Nizam&#x27;s crown was also removed from the university seal.
== Seal ==
The original seal featured the Nizam&#x27;s crown as the crest, along with the phrase &quot;Noorun Ala Noor&quot;. It also contained the hadith, &quot;I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate&quot;.

The present emblem contains inscriptions in Telugu and Sanskrit. The new logo has the Urdu letter Ain in between.

==Campus==

The Main campus is a chief intellectual centre in Hyderabad, and its alumni and faculty members include many distinguished individuals, including former Prime Minister of India P. V. Narasimha Rao.

<text>James Edward Yancey (February 20, c. 1895 – September 17, 1951) was an American boogie-woogie pianist, composer, and lyricist. One reviewer described him as &quot;one of the pioneers of this raucous, rapid-fire, eight-to-the-bar piano style&quot;.

==Biography==
Jimmy Yancey was born in Chicago, Illinois, most likely in 1895. However, at different times he stated 1900 and 1903, and other sources give 1894 or 1898. Researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc suggest 1901.

His brother, Alonzo Yancey (1897–1944), was also a pianist, and their father was a vaudeville guitarist and singer. By age ten, Yancey had toured across the United States as a tap dancer and singer, and by twenty he had toured throughout Europe. He began teaching himself to play the piano at the age of 15, and by 1915 had gained a sufficient profile to influence younger musicians, including Meade Lux Lewis and Albert Ammons.

Yancey played in a boogie-woogie style, with a strong-repeated figure in the left hand and melodic decoration in the right, but his playing was delicate and subtle rather than hard driving. He popularized the left-hand figure that became known as the &quot;Yancey bass&quot;, later used in Pee Wee Crayton&#x27;s &quot;Blues After Hours&quot;, Guitar Slim&#x27;s &quot;The Things That I Used to Do&quot;, and many other songs. Yancey favored keys—such as E-flat and A-flat—that were atypical for barrelhouse blues. Distinctively, he ended many pieces in the key of E-flat, even if he had played in a different key until the ending.

Although influential from an early age, Yancey did not record at all in his early career, performing only at house parties and clubs. His first recordings, in 1939, created a considerable stir in blues and jazz circles. He made most of his recordings solo, but later in his career he recorded with his wife, Estelle Yancey, singing, as Jimmy and Mama Yancey. They appeared in concert at Carnegie Hall in 1948, and recorded their first album in 1951, released by Atlantic Records the following year. During World War I, Yancey played baseball for the Chicago All-Americans, a Negro league baseball team. From 1925 to 1950, he worked as a groundskeeper for the Chicago White Sox.

==Death==

Jimmy Yancey died of a diabetes-induced stroke in his native Chicago on September 17, 1951, and was buried at Lincoln Cemetery in Blue Island, Illinois. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.

==Legacy and influence==
In 1973, the Dutch composer Louis Andriessen premiered &quot;On Jimmy Yancey&quot;, a two-movement work scored for nine wind instruments, piano and double bass. Andriessen observed that Yancey was not merely one of the pioneers of the boogie-woogie piano style. &quot;The leaping left hand of Ragtime changed into a monotonous repeating train-like figure, which in fact was more melodious than the Ragtime bass. In the first movement, three Yancey themes are quoted; the second is a kind of In Memoriam. Both movements end with a typical boogie-woogie lick, with which Yancey unexpectedly ends all his recordings. He probably did this at a sign from the producer, when the three minutes which a 78 side could hold were up, because boogie-woogie pianists habitually played for hours on end in the bars to entertain the white bourgeoisie.&quot;

<text>Louis Thomas Jordan (July 8, 1908 – February 4, 1975) was an American saxophonist, multi-instrumentalist, songwriter and bandleader who was popular from the late 1930s to the early 1950s. Known as &quot;the King of the Jukebox&quot;, he earned his highest profile towards the end of the swing era.

Specializing in the alto sax, Jordan played all forms of the saxophone, as well as piano and clarinet. He also was a talented singer with great comedic flair, and fronted his own band for more than twenty years. He duetted with some of the biggest solo singing stars of his time, including Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong. 

Jordan began his career in big-band swing jazz in the 1930s coming to the public&#x27;s attention as part of Chick Webb&#x27;s hard swinging band though he became better known as an innovative popularizer of jump blues, a swinging, up-tempo, dance-oriented hybrid of jazz, blues and boogie-woogie. Typically performed by smaller bands consisting of five or six players, jump music featured shouted, highly syncopated vocals and earthy, comedic lyrics on contemporary urban themes. It strongly emphasized the rhythm section of piano, bass and drums; after the mid-1940s, this mix was often augmented by electric guitar. Jordan&#x27;s band also pioneered the use of the electronic organ.

With his dynamic bands that he called The Tympany Five no matter how many musicians were in it, Jordan mapped out the main parameters of the classic R&amp;B, urban blues and early rock-and-roll genres with a series of highly influential 78-rpm discs released by Decca Records. These recordings presaged many of the styles of black popular music of the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s and exerted a strong influence on many leading performers in these genres. Many of his records were produced by Milt Gabler who, in his later production work, played Jordan&#x27;s music for Bill Haley as Haley wanted to transition from country &amp; western to rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll resulting in Haley&#x27;s huge hit, &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;.

Jordan was also an actor and a film personality. He appeared in 14 three-minute Soundies filmed for &quot;movie jukeboxes&quot; of the 1940s. He also worked as a specialty act in the Hollywood theatrical features &quot;Follow the Boys&quot; and &quot;Swing Parade of 1946&quot;. His very successful musical short &quot;Caldonia&quot; (1945) prompted three more feature films, all starring Jordan and his band: &quot;Beware&quot;; &quot;Reet, Petite and Gone&quot;; and &quot;Look-Out Sister&quot;.

Jordan ranks fifth in the list of the most successful African-American recording artists according to Joel Whitburn&#x27;s analysis of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s R&amp;B chart, and was the most popular rhythm and blues artist with his jump blues recordings of the pre-rock n&#x27; roll era. Though comprehensive sales figures are not available, Jordan had at least four million-selling hits during his career and regularly topped the R&amp;B &quot;race&quot; charts, reaching Number 1 a total of 18 times, with 113 weeks in that spot over the years. He was also one of the first black recording artists to achieve significant crossover in popularity with the predominantly white mainstream American audience, having simultaneous Top Ten hits on the pop charts several times.

==Life and career==
Jordan was born on July 8, 1908, in Brinkley, Arkansas. His father, James Aaron Jordan, was a music teacher and bandleader for the Brinkley Brass Band and the Rabbit Foot Minstrels. His mother, Adell, died when Louis was young and his grandmother, Maggie Jordan and his aunt, Lizzie Reid raised him. Under the tutelage of his father, Jordan began studying clarinet at age seven, then saxophone. In his teens, he joined the Rabbit Foot Minstrels and was playing professionally in the late 1920s. In the early 1930s, he played in Philadelphia and New York City with Charlie Gaines, as well as recording with Clarence Williams and his Blue Rhythm Boys and was briefly a member of the Stuff Smith orchestra. With Chick Webb&#x27;s orchestra, he sang and played alto saxophone. In 1938, he started a band that recorded a year later as the Tympany Five. 
Jordan&#x27;s first band, drawn mainly from members of the Jesse Stone band, was a nine-piece group that he reduced to a sextet after being hired for a residency at the Elks Rendezvous club at 464 Lenox Avenue in Harlem. The band consisted of Jordan (saxes, vocals), Courtney Williams (trumpet), Lem Johnson (tenor sax), Clarence Johnson (piano), Charlie Drayton (bass), and Walter Martin (drums). In his first billing as the Elks Rendez-vous Band, his name was spelled &quot;Louie&quot; so people could avoid pronouncing it &quot;Lewis&quot;.
In 1942, Jordan and his band moved to Los Angeles where he began making soundies, the precursors of music videos. He appeared on many Jubilee radio shows and a series of programs for the Armed Forces Radio that were distributed to American troops overseas. Jordan&#x27;s career was uninterrupted by the draft except for a four-week Army camp tour. Because of a &quot;hernia condition&quot; he was classified &quot;4F&quot;.

During the 1940s, Jordan and the band became popular with such hits as &quot;Choo Choo Ch&#x27;Boogie&quot;, &quot;Knock Me a Kiss&quot;, &quot;Is You Is or Is You Ain&#x27;t My Baby&quot;, and &quot;Five Guys Named Moe&quot;. He recorded with Ella Fitzgerald both during and after their time with Chick Webb, also Bing Crosby and Louis Armstrong and appeared in films. Within a year of his breakthrough, the Tympany Five&#x27;s appearance fee rose from $350 to $2,000 per night. But the breadth of Jordan&#x27;s success and the size of his combo had larger implications for the music industry. The blues singer Gatemouth Moore said, &quot;He was playing ... with five pieces. That ruined the big bands ... He could play just as good and just as loud with five as 17. And it was cheaper.&quot;

Jordan&#x27;s raucous recordings were notable for using contemporary narratives. This is perhaps best exemplified on &quot;Saturday Night Fish Fry&quot;, a two-part 1950 hit that was split across both sides of a 78-rpm record. It was one of the first popular songs to use the word &quot;rocking&quot; in the chorus and to feature a distorted electric guitar. Many sources describe this recording, and some others by Jordan, as &quot;jump blues&quot;, because &quot;it literally made its listeners jump to its pulsing beat&quot;, according to NPR. One source states that &quot;Saturday Night Fish Fry&quot; had a &quot;lively jump rhythm, call-and-response chorus and double-string electric guitar riffs that Chuck Berry would later admit to copying&quot;.

He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 as an &quot;early influence&quot;. He is described by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as &quot;The Father of Rhythm &amp; Blues&quot; and &quot;The Grandfather of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. The Hall also states that &quot;Saturday Night Fish Fry&quot; is &quot;an early example of rap and possibly the first rock and roll recording&quot;. Not all critics agree with the importance of his work as a rock and roll influence. For example, Rolling Stone offers this take on Jordan&#x27;s recordings from the late 1940s: &quot;... the early idol of both Berry and Bill Haley, came closest, but his jump &#x27;n&#x27; jive story songs were aimed as much at adults as teens, and any hillbilly flavor in his records was strictly a comedic device&quot;. The article agrees with Sam Phillips that rock and roll &quot;specifically addressed and was tailored to teenagers&quot;.

Another source describes Jordan&#x27;s jump blues style as combining &quot;good-natured novelty lyrics (some with suggestive double meanings); [pushing] the tempo; [strengthening] the beat and [layering] the sound with his bluesy saxophone and playful melodies.&quot;

During this period, Jordan crossed over on the popular music charts placing more than a dozen songs nationally though his greatest success was with the Tympany Five dominating the 1940s R&amp;B charts, or (as they were known at the time) the &quot;race&quot; charts. In this period, Jordan had eighteen Number 1 singles and fifty four in the Top Ten. According to Joel Whitburn&#x27;s analysis of the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine charts, Jordan ranks fifth among the most successful musicians of the period 1942–1995. From July 1946 through May 1947, Jordan had five consecutive number one songs, holding the top slot for 44 consecutive weeks.

Jordan&#x27;s popularity was boosted not only by his hit Decca records but also by his prolific recordings for Armed Forces Radio and the V-Disc transcription program along with starring in short musical films and making &quot;soundies&quot; of his hit songs all of which helped make him popular with whites and blacks alike.

Jordan was certainly a significant figure in the development of rhythm and blues. According to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, he and Big Joe Turner laid the foundation for R&amp;B in the 1940s, &quot;cutting one swinging rhythm &amp; blues masterpiece after another&quot;. Stepping away from his rhythm and blues style, Jordan started a big band in the early 1950s that was unsuccessful. Throughout the 1950s, illness kept him near his home in Arizona.

On June 1, 1952, Jordan performed at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles for the eighth Cavalcade of Jazz concert which Leon Hefflin, Sr. produced. On June 20, 1954, he and his Tympany Five returned for the tenth Cavalcade of Jazz concert.

Jordan signed with Aladdin for which he recorded 21 songs in early 1954. They released nine singles from these sessions; three of the songs were not released. In 1955, he recorded with &quot;X&quot; Records, a subsidiary of RCA, which had changed its name to Vik Records while Jordan was with them. Three singles were by released by &quot;X&quot; and one by Vik; four tracks were not released. For these sessions, Jordan changed and simplified his sound, wanting to be part of the rock and roll wave. In 1956, Mercury signed Jordan and released two albums and a handful of singles. His first album for Mercury, &quot;Somebody Up There Digs Me&quot; (1956), showcased updated rock-and-roll versions of previous hits such as &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody Here but Us Chickens&quot;, &quot;Caldonia&quot;, &quot;Choo Choo Ch&#x27;Boogie&quot;, &quot;Salt Pork, West Virginia&quot;, and &quot;Beware!&quot; Mercury intended this to be a comeback for Jordan, but it was commercially unsuccessful, and the label let him go in 1958. Jordan later expressed disliking rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and commented &quot;A lot of companies have asked me to record, but they insisted that I go into rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, and I didn&#x27;t want to change my style&quot;. He recorded sporadically in the 1960s for Warwick (1960), Black Lion (1962), Tangerine (1962–1965), and Pzazz (1968) and in the early 1970s for Black &amp; Blue (1973), Blues Spectrum (1973), and JSP (1974).

In the early 1960s, he toured in England with Chris Barber. Speaking in 2012, Barber recalled seeing Jordan at the Apollo Theater in New York:
Jordan remade some of his top hits for a 1973 LP, &quot;I Believe in Music&quot;: &quot;Caldonia&quot;, &quot;Is You Is or Is You Ain&#x27;t My Baby&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Fish Fry&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town&quot;. He also added new material.

According to a Billboard book cited by the Blues Hall of Fame, Jordan had &quot;18 No. 1 hits on the race and R&amp;B charts spent a total of 113 weeks in the top slot, almost twice as many weeks as any other artist in the history of rhythm &amp; blues&quot;.

One publication of the Smithsonian Institution provided this summary of Jordan&#x27;s music.One important stylistic prototype in the development of R&amp;B was jump blues, pioneered by Louis Jordan, with his group Louis Jordan and His Tympany Five. Jordan&#x27;s group ... consisted of three horns and a rhythm section, while stylistically his music melded elements of swing and blues, incorporating the shuffle rhythm, boogie-woogie bass lines, and short horn patterns or riffs. The songs featured the use of African American vernacular language, humor, and vocal call-and-response sections between Jordan and the band. Jordan&#x27;s music appealed to both African American and white audiences, and he had broad success with hit songs like &quot;Is You Is or Is You Ain&#x27;t My Baby&quot; (1944).

=== Films ===
Jordan and the Tympany Five perform &quot;Deacon Jones&quot; in the 1944 film &quot;Meet Miss Bobby Socks&quot;.

The release of the 1945 musical short film &quot;Caldonia&quot; boosted Jordan&#x27;s career due to roadshow screenings in support of his live performance. In addition to his performances in other mainstream films, such as &quot;Follow the Boys&quot; (1944), Jordan&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Caldonia&quot; (1945) and that film&#x27;s success led to roles for him in other race films, including those made by Astor Pictures: &quot;Beware!&quot; (1946), &quot;Reet, Petite, and Gone&quot; (1947), and &quot;Look-Out Sister&quot; (1947).

His prolific use of film as a promotional vehicle broke new ground, garnering praise from &quot;Billboard&quot; which wrote, &quot;The movies have helped the one-nighters, which have also been helped by recordings, which have also helped the movies, which in turn have become more profitable. It&#x27;s a delicious circle, and other bands are now exploring the possibilities.&quot;

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages ===
Jordan was married five times. His first wife, Julia (also called Julie) was from Arkadelphia, Arkansas. Soon after their wedding, Julia gave birth to a daughter, Patty, who turned out to be another man&#x27;s child.

In 1932, Jordan met Ida Fields, a Texas-born singer and dancer, in Hot Springs. They married that year. Ida was six years his senior and a member of a traveling dance troupe called the Florida Orange Blossoms. Ida sued Jordan for bigamy in 1943. He claimed she was aware that he was still married. Ida was awarded a $70,000 judgment, later reduced to $30,000. She began billing herself as &quot;Mrs. Louis Jordan, Queen of the Blues, and her Orchestra&quot; before Jordan stopped it by stalling payments. In another court case, Ida was awarded a settlement of $50,000.

In 1942, Jordan married his childhood sweetheart, Fleecie Moore. They later divorced. In 1947, Fleecie discovered Jordan was having an affair with dancer Florence &quot;Vicky&quot; Hayes and attacked him with a knife. She was arrested and charged with assault. Jordan married Vicky on November 14, 1951, in Providence, Rhode Island. They separated in 1960. 

He married Martha Weaver, a singer and dancer from St. Louis, in 1966. Weaver being a Catholic, Jordan sometimes attended Mass with her on Sundays, though he was raised a Baptist.

=== Financial problems ===
Jordan&#x27;s popularity and success had waned by 1953. By that time, &quot;rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll had captured the world&#x27;s attention, and Jordan&#x27;s jumping R&amp;B became a thing of the past&quot;. While he continued performing, this did not generate the level of income that million-selling recordings had provided.

In 1961, the Internal Revenue Service filed an income tax lien against Jordan. As a result, he sold property well below its worth to pay off debts. Musician Ike Turner stated in his autobiography, &quot;Takin&#x27; Back My Name&quot;, that he heard about his tax problems and contacted Jordan&#x27;s booking agency in Chicago. Turner convinced the president of the company to send Jordan a check for $20,000. Jordan was unaware of this deed.

Jordan wrote or co-wrote many of the songs he performed, but he did not benefit financially from them. Many of the hit songs he wrote, including &quot;Caldonia&quot;, he credited to Fleecie Moore to avoid an existing publishing arrangement. Their marriage was acrimonious and short-lived. After their divorce, she retained ownership of the songs. However, Jordan may have taken credit for some songs written by others, he is credited as the co-writer of &quot;Saturday Night Fish Fry&quot;, but Tympany Five pianist Bill Doggett claimed he wrote it.

== Death ==
Jordan died of a heart attack on February 4, 1975, in Los Angeles. He is buried at Mt. Olive Catholic Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri, the hometown of his wife Martha.

==Awards and legacy==
On June 23, 2008, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution introduced by Arkansas Representative Vic Snyder honoring Jordan on the centenary of his birth.

The United States Postal Service featured Jordan and his film for &quot;Caldonia&quot; in 2008 as part of its tribute to Vintage Black Cinema. &quot;Vivid reminders of a bygone era will be celebrated in June through Vintage Black Cinema stamps based on five vintage movie posters. Whether spotlighting the talents of entertainment icons or documenting changing social attitudes and expectations, these posters now serve a greater purpose than publicity and promotion. They are invaluable pieces of history, preserving memories of cultural phenomena that otherwise might have been forgotten. The stamp pane was designed by Carl Herrman of Carlsbad, California.&quot;

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame states that two of the most important originators of rhythm and blues were Joe Turner and Louis Jordan with his Tympany Five. The two artists helped to lay &quot;the foundation for R&amp;B in the 1940s, cutting one swinging rhythm &amp; blues masterpiece after another&quot;. The Hall also describes Jordan as &quot;the Father of Rhythm &amp; Blues&quot;, &quot;the Grandfather of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; and &quot;King of the Juke Boxes&quot;. Another source states that with &quot;Caldonia&quot; (1945), Jordan was &quot;already crafting the classic rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll sound&quot;. The Hall of Fame considers &quot;his classic &#x27;Saturday Night Fish Fry&#x27; (1949) as an early example of rap and possibly the first rock and roll recording&quot;.

The Blues Foundation hints that Jordan was a precursor to R&amp;B: &quot;Louis Jordan was the biggest African-American star of his era&quot; and that his &quot;Caldonia&quot; reached &quot;the top of the Race Records chart, as it was known prior to being called Rhythm &amp; Blues in 1949&quot;.

Chuck Berry said that he modeled his musical approach on Jordan&#x27;s. Berry changed the lyric content from black life to teenage life, and substituted cars and girls for Jordan&#x27;s primary motifs of food, drink, money and girls. Berry&#x27;s iconic opening riff on &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; bears a striking similarity to the intro played by the guitarist Carl Hogan on the 1946 hit &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Just Like a Woman&quot;; Berry has acknowledged the debt in interviews. Other sources also indicate that Little Richard was influenced by Jordan. In fact, the artist said &quot;Caldonia&quot; was the first non-gospel song he learned; and the shriek (or &quot;whoop&quot;) on the Jordan record &quot;sounds eerily like the vocal tone Little Richard would adopt&quot;, in addition to the &quot;Jordan-style pencil-thin moustache&quot;. James Brown and Ray Charles also said that Jordan&#x27;s style had an influence on their work.

B.B. King cites Jordan as an influence and recorded an album of his tunes called &quot;Let the Good Times Roll: The Music of Louis Jordan&quot;. The band included Earl Palmer, drums, Dr. John, piano, Hank Crawford, alto sax, David &quot;Fathead&quot; Newman, tenor sax, and Marcus Belgrave, trumpet.

Jordan was inducted into both the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame and the Blues Hall of Fame; and in 2018, he posthumously received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. The Academy believes that he &quot;led the way for rock and roll in the 50s. His recordings in the GRAMMY Hall Of Fame include: &#x27;Ain&#x27;t Nobody Here But Us Chickens&#x27;, &#x27;Caldonia Boogie&#x27;, &#x27;Choo Choo Ch&#x27;Boogie&#x27;, and &#x27;Let The Good Times Roll&#x27;&quot;.

According to Cleveland.com, &quot;Louis Jordan had a profound impact on several African-American music genres that evolved during the first half of the 20th century ... He helped make jump blues, jazz and boogie-woogie mainstream forces. Jordan&#x27;s legendary work would serve as a precursor to modern blues, rock and roll and R&amp;B music&quot;.

In 1990, &quot;Five Guys Named Moe,&quot; a musical built around the songs of Louis Jordan, opened in London&#x27;s West End and ran for over four years, winning a Laurence Olivier Award. It opened on Broadway in 1992 and received two Tony Award nominations. Tours and revivals continued into the 2020s.

<doc id="166072" wikidata="Q1031651" url="?curid=166072" title="Sound barrier">
<text>The sound barrier or sonic barrier is the large increase in aerodynamic drag and other undesirable effects experienced by an aircraft or other object when it approaches the speed of sound. When aircraft first approached the speed of sound, these effects were seen as constituting a barrier, making faster speeds very difficult or impossible. The term &quot;sound barrier&quot; is still sometimes used today to refer to aircraft approaching supersonic flight in this high drag regime. Flying faster than sound produces a sonic boom.

In dry air at 20 °C (68 °F), the speed of sound is 343 metres per second (about 767 mph, 1234 km/h or 1,125 ft/s). The term came into use during World War II when pilots of high-speed fighter aircraft experienced the effects of compressibility, a number of adverse aerodynamic effects that deterred further acceleration, seemingly impeding flight at speeds close to the speed of sound. These difficulties represented a barrier to flying at faster speeds. In 1947, American test pilot Chuck Yeager demonstrated that safe flight at the speed of sound was achievable in purpose-designed aircraft, thereby breaking the barrier. By the 1950s, new designs of fighter aircraft routinely reached the speed of sound, and faster.

==History==
Some common whips such as the bullwhip or stockwhip are able to move faster than sound: the tip of the whip exceeds this speed and causes a sharp crack—literally a sonic boom. Firearms made after the 19th century generally have a supersonic muzzle velocity.

The sound barrier may have been first breached by living beings about 150 million years ago. Some paleobiologists report that computer models of their biomechanical capabilities suggest that certain long-tailed dinosaurs such as &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;, &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Diplodocus&quot; could flick their tails at supersonic speeds, creating a cracking sound. This finding is theoretical and disputed by others in the field. Meteorites in the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere usually travel at higher than Earth&#x27;s escape velocity, which is much faster than sound.

===Early problems===
The existence of the sound barrier was evident to aerodynamicists before any direct in-aircraft evidence was available. In particular, the very simple theory of thin airfoils at supersonic speeds produced a curve that went to infinite drag at Mach 1, dropping with increasing speed. This could be seen in tests using projectiles fired from guns, a common method for checking the stability of various projective shapes. As the projectile slowed from its initial speed and began to approach the speed of sound, it would undergo a rapid increase in drag and slow much more rapidly. It was understood that the drag did not go infinite, or it would be impossible for the projectile to get above Mach 1 in the first place, but there was no better theory, and data was matching theory to some degree. At the same time, ever-increasing wind tunnel speeds were showing a similar effect as one approached Mach 1 from below. In this case, however, there was no theoretical development that suggested why this might be. What was noticed was that the increase in drag was not smooth, it had a distinct &quot;corner&quot; where it began to suddenly rise. This speed was different for different wing planforms and cross sections, and became known as the &quot;critical Mach&quot;.

According to British aerodynamicist W. F. Hilton, of Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft, the term itself was created accidentally. He was giving demonstrations at the annual show day at the National Physical Laboratory in 1935 where he demonstrated a chart of wind tunnel measurements comparing the drag of a wing to the velocity of the air. During these explanations he would state &quot;See how the resistance of a wing shoots up like a barrier against higher speed, as we approach the speed of sound.&quot; The next day, the London newspapers were filled with statements about a &quot;sound barrier.&quot; Whether or not this is the first use of the term is debatable, but by the 1940s use within the industry was already common.

By the late 1930s, one practical outcome of this was becoming clear. Although aircraft were still operating well below Mach 1, generally half that at best, their engines were rapidly pushing past 1,000 hp. At these power levels, the traditional two-bladed propellers were clearly showing rapid increases in drag. The tip speed of a propeller blade is a function of the rotational speed and the length of the blade. As the engine power increased, longer blades were needed to apply this power to the air while operating at the most efficient RPM of the engine. The velocity of the air is also a function of the forward speed of the aircraft. When the aircraft speed is high enough, the tips reach transonic speeds. Shock waves form at the blade tips and sap the shaft power driving the propeller. To maintain thrust, the engine power must replace this loss, and must also match the aircraft drag as it increases with speed. The required power is so great that the size and weight of the engine becomes prohibitive. This speed limitation led to research into jet engines, notably by Frank Whittle in England and Hans von Ohain in Germany. This also led to propellers with ever-increasing numbers of blades, three, four and then five were seen during the war. As the problem became better understood, it also led to &quot;paddle bladed&quot; propellers with increased chord, as seen (for example) on late-war models of the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt.

Nevertheless, propeller aircraft &quot;were&quot; able to approach their critical Mach number, different for each aircraft, in a dive. Doing so led to numerous crashes for a variety of reasons. Flying the Mitsubishi Zero, pilots sometimes flew at full power into terrain because the rapidly increasing forces acting on the control surfaces of their aircraft overpowered them. In this case, several attempts to fix it only made the problem worse. Likewise, the flexing caused by the low torsional stiffness of the Supermarine Spitfire&#x27;s wings caused them, in turn, to counteract aileron control inputs, leading to a condition known as &quot;control reversal&quot;. This was solved in later models with changes to the wing. Worse still, a particularly dangerous interaction of the airflow between the wings and tail surfaces of diving Lockheed P-38 Lightnings made &quot;pulling out&quot; of dives difficult; in one 1941 test flight test pilot Ralph Virde was killed when the plane flew into the ground at high speed. The problem was later solved by the addition of a &quot;dive flap&quot; that upset the airflow under these circumstances. Flutter due to the formation of shock waves on curved surfaces was another major problem, which led most famously to the breakup of a de Havilland Swallow and death of its pilot Geoffrey de Havilland, Jr. on 27 September 1946. A similar problem is thought to have been the cause of the 1943 crash of the BI-1 rocket aircraft in the Soviet Union.

All of these effects, although unrelated in most ways, led to the concept of a &quot;barrier&quot; making it difficult for an aircraft to exceed the speed of sound. Erroneous news reports caused most people to envision the sound barrier as a physical &quot;wall,&quot; which supersonic aircraft needed to &quot;break&quot; with a sharp needle nose on the front of the fuselage. Rocketry and artillery experts&#x27; products routinely exceeded Mach 1, but aircraft designers and aerodynamicists during and after World War II discussed Mach 0.7 as a limit dangerous to exceed.

===Early claims===
During WWII and immediately thereafter, a number of claims were made that the sound barrier had been broken in a dive. The majority of these purported events can be dismissed as instrumentation errors. The typical airspeed indicator (ASI) uses air pressure differences between two or more points on the aircraft, typically near the nose and at the side of the fuselage, to produce a speed figure. At high speed, the various compression effects that lead to the sound barrier also cause the ASI to go non-linear and produce inaccurately high or low readings, depending on the specifics of the installation. This effect became known as &quot;Mach jump&quot;. Before the introduction of Mach meters, accurate measurements of supersonic speeds could only be made remotely, normally using ground-based instruments. Many claims of supersonic speeds were found to be far below this speed when measured in this fashion.

In 1942, Republic Aviation issued a press release stating that Lts. Harold E. Comstock and Roger Dyar had exceeded the speed of sound during test dives in a Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. It is widely agreed that this was due to inaccurate ASI readings. In similar tests, the North American P-51 Mustang demonstrated limits at Mach 0.85, with every flight over Mach 0.84 causing the aircraft to be damaged by vibration.

One of the highest recorded instrumented Mach numbers attained for a propeller aircraft is the Mach 0.891 for a Spitfire PR XI, flown during dive tests at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough in April 1944. The Spitfire, a photo-reconnaissance variant, the Mark XI, fitted with an extended &quot;rake type&quot; multiple pitot system, was flown by Squadron Leader J. R. Tobin to this speed, corresponding to a corrected true airspeed (TAS) of 606 mph. In a subsequent flight, Squadron Leader Anthony Martindale achieved Mach 0.92, but it ended in a forced landing after over-revving damaged the engine.

Hans Guido Mutke claimed to have broken the sound barrier on 9 April 1945 in the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet aircraft. He states that his ASI pegged itself at . Mutke reported not just transonic buffeting, but the resumption of normal control once a certain speed was exceeded, then a resumption of severe buffeting once the Me 262 slowed again. He also reported engine flame-out.

This claim is widely disputed, even by pilots in his unit. All of the effects he reported are known to occur on the Me 262 at much lower speeds, and the ASI reading is simply not reliable in the transonic. Further, a series of tests made by Karl Doetsch at the behest of Willy Messerschmitt found that the plane became uncontrollable above Mach 0.86, and at Mach 0.9 would nose over into a dive that could not be recovered from. Post-war tests by the RAF confirmed these results, with the slight modification that the maximum speed using new instruments was found to be Mach 0.84, rather than Mach 0.86.

In 1999, Mutke enlisted the help of Professor Otto Wagner of the Munich Technical University to run computational tests to determine whether the aircraft could break the sound barrier. These tests do not rule out the possibility, but are lacking accurate data on the coefficient of drag that would be needed to make accurate simulations. Wagner stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to exclude the possibility, but I can imagine he may also have been just below the speed of sound and felt the buffeting, but did not go above Mach-1.&quot;

One bit of evidence presented by Mutke is on page 13 of the &quot;Me 262 A-1 Pilot&#x27;s Handbook&quot; issued by Headquarters Air Materiel Command, Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio as Report No. F-SU-1111-ND on January 10, 1946:

The comments about restoration of flight control and cessation of buffeting above Mach 1 are very significant in a 1946 document. However, it is not clear where these terms came from, as it does not appear the US pilots carried out such tests.

In his 1990 book &quot;Me-163&quot;, former Messerschmitt Me 163 &quot;Komet&quot; pilot Mano Ziegler claims that his friend, test pilot Heini Dittmar, broke the sound barrier while diving the rocket plane, and that several people on the ground heard the sonic booms. He claims that on 6 July 1944, Dittmar, flying Me 163B V18, bearing the alphabetic code VA+SP, was measured traveling at a speed of 1,130 km/h (702 mph). However, no evidence of such a flight exists in any of the materials from that period, which were captured by Allied forces and extensively studied. Dittmar had been officially recorded at 1,004.5 km/h (623.8 mph) in level flight on 2 October 1941 in the prototype Me 163A V4. He reached this speed at less than full throttle, as he was concerned by the transonic buffeting. Dittmar himself does not make a claim that he broke the sound barrier on that flight and notes that the speed was recorded only on the AIS. He does, however, take credit for being the first pilot to &quot;knock on the sound barrier&quot;.

There are a number of uncrewed vehicles that flew at supersonic speeds during this period. In 1933, Soviet designers working on ramjet concepts fired phosphorus-powered engines out of artillery guns to get them to operational speeds. It is possible that this produced supersonic performance as high as Mach 2, but this was not due solely to the engine itself. In contrast, the German V-2 ballistic missile routinely broke the sound barrier in flight, for the first time on 3 October 1942. By September 1944, V-2s routinely achieved Mach 4 (1,200 m/s, or 3044 mph) during terminal descent.

===Breaking the sound barrier===

In 1942, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Ministry of Aviation began a top-secret project with Miles Aircraft to develop the world&#x27;s first aircraft capable of breaking the sound barrier. The project resulted in the development of the prototype Miles M.52 turbojet-powered aircraft, which was designed to reach 1,000 mph (417 m/s; 1,600 km/h) (over twice the existing speed record) in level flight, and to climb to an altitude of 36,000 ft (11 km) in 1 minute 30 seconds.

A number of advanced features were incorporated into the resulting M.52 design, which resulted from consulting experts in government establishments with a current knowledge of supersonic aerodynamics. In particular, the design featured a conical nose, for low supersonic drag, and sharp wing leading edges. The design used very thin wings of biconvex section proposed by Jakob Ackeret for low drag. The wing tips were &quot;clipped&quot; to keep them clear of the conical shock wave generated by the nose of the aircraft. The fuselage had a 5-foot diameter with an annular fuel tank around the engine.
Another critical addition was the use of a power-operated stabilator, also known as the all-moving tail or flying tail, a key to transonic and supersonic flight control, which contrasted with traditional hinged tailplanes (horizontal stabilizers) connected mechanically to the pilots control column. Conventional control surfaces became ineffective at the high subsonic speeds then being achieved by fighters in dives, due to the aerodynamic forces caused by the formation of shockwaves at the hinge and the rearward movement of the centre of pressure, which together could override the control forces that could be applied mechanically by the pilot, hindering recovery from the dive. A major impediment to early transonic flight was control reversal, the phenomenon which caused flight inputs (stick, rudder) to switch direction at high speed; it was the cause of many accidents and near-accidents. An all-flying tail is required for an aircraft to pass through the transonic speed range safely, without losing pilot control. The Miles M.52 was the first instance of this solution, which has since been universally applied.

Initially, the aircraft was to use Frank Whittle&#x27;s latest engine, the Power Jets W.2/700, with which it would only reach supersonic speed in a shallow dive. To develop a fully supersonic version of the aircraft, extra thrust would be provided with the addition of the No.4 augmentor which gave extra airflow from a ducted fan and reheat behind the fan.

Although the project was eventually cancelled, the research was used to construct an uncrewed 30% scale model of the M.52 that went on to achieve a speed of Mach 1.38 in a successful, controlled transonic and supersonic level test flight in October 1948; this was a unique achievement at that time which provided &quot;some validation of the aerodynamics of the M.52 upon which the model was based&quot;.

Meanwhile, test pilots achieved high speeds in the tailless, swept-wing de Havilland DH 108. One of them was Geoffrey de Havilland, Jr., who was killed on 27 September 1946 when his DH 108 broke up at about Mach 0.9. John Derry has been called &quot;Britain&#x27;s first supersonic pilot&quot; because of a dive he made in a DH 108 on 6 September 1948.

===The first aircraft to officially break the sound barrier ===
The British Air Ministry signed an agreement with the United States to exchange all its high-speed research data and designs, including that for the M.52, with equivalent US research but the U.S. reneged on the agreement, and nothing was forthcoming in return.
The Bell X-1, the first US crewed aircraft built to break the sound barrier, was visually similar to the Miles M.52 but with a high-mounted horizontal tail to keep it clear of the wing wake. Compared to the all-moving tail on the M.52 the X-1 used a conventional tail with elevators but with a movable stabilizer to maintain control passing through the sound barrier. It was in the X-1 that Chuck Yeager became the first person to break the sound barrier in level flight on 14 October 1947, flying at an altitude of 45,000 ft (13.7 km). George Welch made a plausible but officially unverified claim to have broken the sound barrier on 1 October 1947, while flying an XP-86 Sabre. He also claimed to have repeated his supersonic flight on 14 October 1947, 30 minutes before Yeager broke the sound barrier in the Bell X-1. Although evidence from witnesses and instruments strongly imply that Welch achieved supersonic speed, the flights were not properly monitored and are not officially recognized. The XP-86 officially achieved supersonic speed on 26 April 1948.

On 14 October 1947, just under a month after the United States Air Force had been created as a separate service, the tests culminated in the first crewed supersonic flight, piloted by Air Force Captain Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Yeager in aircraft #46-062, which he had christened &quot;Glamorous Glennis&quot;. The rocket-powered aircraft was launched from the bomb bay of a specially modified B-29 and glided to a landing on a runway. XS-1 flight number 50 is the first one where the X-1 recorded supersonic flight, with a maximum speed of Mach 1.06 (361 m/s, 1,299 km/h, 807.2 mph).

As a result of the X-1&#x27;s initial supersonic flight, the National Aeronautics Association voted its 1947 Collier Trophy to be shared by the three main participants in the program. Honored at the White House by President Harry S. Truman were Larry Bell for Bell Aircraft, Captain Yeager for piloting the flights, and John Stack for the NACA contributions.

Jackie Cochran was the first woman to break the sound barrier, which she did on 18 May 1953, piloting a plane borrowed from the Royal Canadian Air Force, with Yeager accompanying her.

On December 3, 1957, Margaret Chase Smith became the first woman in Congress to break the sound barrier, which she did as a passenger in an F-100 Super Sabre piloted by Air Force Major Clyde Good.

In the late 1950s, Allen Rowley, a British journalist, was able to fly in a Super Sabre at 1000 mph, one of the few non-American civilians to exceed the speed of sound and one of the few civilians anywhere to make such a trip.

On 21 August 1961, a Douglas DC-8-43 (registration N9604Z) unofficially exceeded Mach 1 in a controlled dive during a test flight at Edwards Air Force Base, as observed and reported by the flight crew; the crew were William Magruder (pilot), Paul Patten (co-pilot), Joseph Tomich (flight engineer), and Richard H. Edwards (flight test engineer). This was the first supersonic flight by a civilian airliner, achieved before the Concorde or the Tu-144 flew.

===The sound barrier understood===
As the science of high-speed flight became more widely understood, a number of changes led to the eventual understanding that the &quot;sound barrier&quot; is easily penetrated, with the right conditions. Among these changes were the introduction of thin swept wings, the area rule, and engines of ever-increasing performance. By the 1950s, many combat aircraft could routinely break the sound barrier in level flight, although they often suffered from control problems when doing so, such as Mach tuck. Modern aircraft can transit the &quot;barrier&quot; without control problems.

By the late 1950s, the issue was so well understood that many companies started investing in the development of supersonic airliners, or SSTs, believing that to be the next &quot;natural&quot; step in airliner evolution. However, this has not yet happened. Although the Concorde and the Tupolev Tu-144 entered service in the 1970s, both were later retired without being replaced by similar designs. The last flight of a Concorde in service was in 2003. Despite a resurgence of interest in the 2010s, as of 2024 there are no commercial supersonic airliners in service.

Although Concorde and the Tu-144 were the first aircraft to carry commercial passengers at supersonic speeds, they were not the first or only commercial airliners to break the sound barrier. On 21 August 1961, a Douglas DC-8 broke the sound barrier at Mach 1.012, or 1,240 km/h (776.2 mph), while in a controlled dive through 41,088 feet (12,510 m). The purpose of the flight was to collect data on a new design of leading edge for the wing.

===Breaking the sound barrier in a land vehicle===
On 12 January 1948, a Northrop uncrewed rocket sled became the first land vehicle to break the sound barrier. At a military test facility at Muroc Air Force Base (now Edwards AFB), California, it reached a peak speed of 1,019 mph (1,640 km/h) before jumping the rails.

On 15 October 1997, in a vehicle designed and built by a team led by Richard Noble, Royal Air Force pilot Andy Green became the first person to break the sound barrier in a land vehicle in compliance with Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile rules. The vehicle, called the ThrustSSC (&quot;Super Sonic Car&quot;), captured the record 50 years and one day after Yeager&#x27;s first supersonic flight.

===Breaking the sound barrier as a human projectile===

====Felix Baumgartner====
In October 2012 Felix Baumgartner, with a team of scientists and sponsor Red Bull, attempted the highest sky-dive on record. The project would see Baumgartner attempt to jump 120,000 ft (36,580 m) from a helium balloon and become the first parachutist to break the sound barrier. The launch was scheduled for 9 October 2012, but was aborted due to adverse weather; subsequently the capsule was launched instead on 14 October. Baumgartner&#x27;s feat also marked the 65th anniversary of U.S. test pilot Chuck Yeager&#x27;s successful attempt to break the sound barrier in an aircraft.

Baumgartner landed in eastern New Mexico after jumping from a world record 128,100 feet (39,045 m), or 24.26 miles, and broke the sound barrier as he traveled at speeds up to 833.9 mph (1342 km/h, or Mach 1.26). In the press conference after his jump, it was announced that he was in freefall for 4 minutes 18 seconds, the second longest freefall after the 1960 jump of Joseph Kittinger for 4 minutes 36 seconds.

====Alan Eustace====
In October 2014, Alan Eustace, a senior vice president at Google, broke Baumgartner&#x27;s record for highest sky-dive and also broke the sound barrier in the process. However, because Eustace&#x27;s jump involved a drogue parachute, while Baumgartner&#x27;s did not, their vertical speed and free-fall distance records remain in different categories.

<text>Aaron Thibeaux &quot;T-Bone&quot; Walker (May 28, 1910 – March 16, 1975) was an American blues musician, composer, songwriter and bandleader, who was a pioneer and innovator of the jump blues, West Coast blues, and electric blues sounds. In 2018 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked him number 67 on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;.

==Biography==

===1910–1941: early years===
Aaron Thibeaux Walker was born in Linden, Texas. His parents, Movelia Jimerson and Rance Walker, were both musicians. His stepfather, Marco Washington (a member of the Dallas String Band), taught him to play the guitar, ukulele, banjo, violin, mandolin, and piano.

Walker began his career as a teenager in Dallas in the 1920s. His mother and stepfather were musicians, and Blind Lemon Jefferson, a family friend, sometimes came over for dinner. Walker left school at the age of 10, and by 15, he was a professional performer on the blues circuit. Initially, he was Jefferson&#x27;s protégé and would guide him around Deep Ellum, Dallas for his gigs. In 1929, Walker made his recording debut with Columbia Records, billed as Oak Cliff T-Bone, releasing the single &quot;Wichita Falls Blues&quot; backed with &quot;Trinity River Blues&quot;. Oak Cliff is the community in which he lived at the time, and T-Bone is a corruption of his middle name. The pianist Douglas Fernell played accompaniment on the record.

Walker married Vida Lee in 1935; the couple had three children.

By the age of 25, Walker was working in clubs on Central Avenue, in Los Angeles, sometimes as the featured singer and as guitarist with Les Hite&#x27;s orchestra. In 1940 he recorded with Hite for the Varsity label, but he was featured only as a singer. He started playing electric guitar in about 1940.

===1942–1975: later years===
In 1942, Charlie Glenn, the owner of the Rhumboogie Café, brought T-Bone Walker to Chicago for long stints in his club. In 1944 and 1945, Walker recorded for the Rhumboogie label, which was tied to the club, backed up by Marl Young&#x27;s orchestra.

T-Bone Walker performed at the second famed Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. on October 12, 1946. Jack McVea, Slim Gaillard, The Honeydrippers, Lionel Hampton and his Orchestra, and Louis Armstrong were also on the program. He performed for the third Cavalcade of Jazz concert held in the same location on September 7, 1947, along with Woody Herman as Emcee, The Valdez Orchestra, The Blenders, The Honeydrippers, Slim Gaillard, Johnny Otis and his Orchestra, Toni Harper, The Three Blazers, and Sarah Vaughan.

Much of his output was recorded from 1946 to 1948 for Black &amp; White Records, including his most famous song, &quot;Call It Stormy Monday (But Tuesday Is Just as Bad)&quot; (1947). Other notable songs he recorded during this period were &quot;Bobby Sox Blues&quot; (a number 3 R&amp;B hit in 1947) and &quot;West Side Baby&quot; (number 8 on the R&amp;B singles chart in 1948).

Throughout his career Walker worked with top-notch musicians, including the trumpeter Teddy Buckner (e.g. on &quot;Call It Stormy Monday (But Tuesday Is Just as Bad)&quot;), the pianist Lloyd Glenn, the bassist Billy Hadnott (on the LP &quot;Hot Leftovers&quot; (1985) and the 78 &quot;Long Skirt Baby Blues&quot;//&quot;Good-Bye Blues&quot; (1947)), and the tenor saxophonist Jack McVea (on the songs &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me Baby&quot; and &quot;No Worry Blues&quot;).

He recorded from 1950 to 1954 for Imperial Records (backed by Dave Bartholomew). Walker&#x27;s only record in the next five years was &quot;T-Bone Blues&quot;, recorded during three widely separated sessions in 1955, 1956 and 1957 and released by Atlantic Records in 1959.

By the early 1960s, Walker&#x27;s career had slowed down, in spite of an energetic performance at the American Folk Blues Festival in 1962 with the pianist Memphis Slim and the prolific writer and musician Willie Dixon, among others. However, several critically acclaimed albums followed, such as &quot;I Want a Little Girl&quot; (recorded for Delmark Records in 1968). Walker recorded in his last years, from 1968 to 1975, for Robin Hemingway&#x27;s music publishing company, Jitney Jane Songs. He won a Grammy Award for Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording in 1970 for &quot;Good Feelin&quot;&#x27;, while signed with Polydor Records, produced by Hemingway, followed by another album produced by Hemingway, &quot;Fly Walker Airlines&quot;, released in 1972.

==Death==

Walker&#x27;s career began to wind down after he suffered a stroke in 1974. He died at his home in Los Angeles of bronchial pneumonia following another stroke in March 1975, at the age of 64. He influenced generations of musicians.

==Legacy==
Walker was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.

Chuck Berry named Walker and Louis Jordan as his main influences. B.B. King cited hearing Walker&#x27;s recording of &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; as his inspiration for getting an electric guitar. In his 1996 autobiography, King commented that when he first heard Walker, he thought &quot;Jesus Himself had returned to earth playing electric guitar. T-Bone&#x27;s blues filled my insides with joy and good feeling. I became his disciple. And remain so today. My biggest musical debt is to T-Bone.&quot; Blues-rock soloing pioneer Lonnie Mack named Walker his principal blues guitar influence. Walker was admired by Jimi Hendrix, who imitated Walker&#x27;s trick of playing the guitar with his teeth. Steve Miller stated that in 1952, when he was eight, Walker taught him how to play his guitar behind his back and also with his teeth. He was a family friend and a frequent visitor to Miller&#x27;s family home and Miller considers him a major influence on his career. &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; was a favorite live number of the Allman Brothers Band. The British rock band Jethro Tull covered Walker&#x27;s &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; in 1968 for John Peel&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot;. Eva Cassidy performed &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; on her 1996 &quot;Live at Blues Alley&quot; recording.

According to Cleveland.com, Walker may have been the best R&amp;B guitarist. He &quot;pioneered electric blues by becoming the first artist to make the electric guitar a solo instrument and a true centerpiece of his stunning live shows&quot;.

<doc id="166078" wikidata="Q392556" url="?curid=166078" title="List of heads of state of Kenya">
<text>This is a list of the heads of state of Kenya, from the independence of Kenya in 1963 to the present day.

From 1963 to 1964 the head of state under the Constitution of 1963 was the queen of Kenya, Elizabeth II, who was also the queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms. The monarch was represented in Kenya by a governor-general. Kenya became a republic within the Commonwealth under a 1964 constitutional amendment and the monarch, governor-general and prime minister were replaced by an executive president.

==Monarch (1963–1964)==
The succession to the throne was the same as the succession to the British throne.
===Governor-general===
The governor-general was the representative of the monarch in Kenya and exercised most of the powers of the monarch. The governor-general was appointed for an indefinite term, serving at the pleasure of the monarch. Since Kenya was granted independence by the Kenya Independence Act 1963, rather than being first established as a semi-autonomous dominion and later promoted to independence as defined by the Statute of Westminster 1931, the governor-general was to be always appointed solely on the advice of the Cabinet of Kenya without the involvement of the British government. As Kenya became a republic before Malcolm MacDonald, the former colonial governor, was replaced, this has never happened. In the event of a vacancy the chief justice would have served as the officer administering the government.

;Status

==Republic (1964–current)==
Under the 1964 Constitutional Amendment establishing the Republic of Kenya, the president replaced the monarch as head of state and the prime minister as chief executive. The president was initially elected by the House of Representatives of Kenya, and, after the merger of the House of Representatives and Senate into a unicameral National Assembly, by the National Assembly, for a five-year term. In the event of a vacancy the vice-president would have served as acting president for 90 days until new elections were held.

Following the enactment of the 1969 Constitution of Kenya, the system of election by the National Assembly was replaced by direct elections under a first-past-the-post system, yet true separation of powers was still not established; the president had to also be elected as an MP and he had to appoint ministers from among MPs, the president was still able to dissolve the National Assembly, and the Assembly was still able to declare no confidence in the ministers. Additionally, until the first multiparty elections in 1992, only one candidate - that of the Kenya African National Union - was nominated and automatically declared winner of the elections without voting actually being held.

With the enactment of the 2010 Constitution, Kenya&#x27;s current, the first-past-the-post system was replaced in presidential elections in favor of a two-round system, the post of vice-president was renamed deputy president and was made to automatically succeed to the presidency in case of a vacancy for the remainder of the term in a full, not merely acting, capacity, and the requirement of the president, DP, and ministers to also be MPs was abolished, finally establishing separation of powers between the executive and legislature.

<doc id="166079" wikidata="Q326434" url="?curid=166079" title="Thomas Couture">
<text>Thomas Couture (; 21 December 1815 – 30 March 1879) was a French history painter and teacher. He taught such later luminaries of the art world as Édouard Manet, Henri Fantin-Latour, John La Farge, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, John Ward Dunsmore, Karel Javůrek, William Morris Hunt, and Joseph-Noël Sylvestre.

==Life==
===Early life and education===
Couture was born at Senlis, Oise, France. When he was 11 his family moved to Paris, where he would study at the industrial arts school (École des Arts et Métiers) and later at the École des Beaux-Arts.

===Art and teaching career===
He failed the prestigious Prix de Rome competition at the École six times, but he felt the problem was with the École, not himself. Couture finally did win the prize in 1837.

In 1840 he began exhibiting historical and genre pictures at the Paris Salon, earning several medals for his works, in particular for his masterpiece, &quot;Romans During the Decadence&quot; (1847). Shortly after this success, Couture opened an independent atelier meant to challenge the École des Beaux-Arts by turning out the best new history painters.

Couture&#x27;s innovative technique gained much attention, and he received Government and Church commissions for murals during the late 1840s through the 1850s. He never completed the first two commissions, and the third met with mixed criticism. Upset by the unfavorable reception of his murals, in 1860 he left Paris, for a time returning to his hometown of Senlis, where he continued to teach young artists who came to him. In 1867 he thumbed his nose at the academic establishment by publishing a book on his own ideas and working methods called &quot;Méthode et entretiens d&#x27;atelier&quot; (&quot;Method and Workshop Interviews&quot;). It was also translated to &quot;Conversations on Art Methods&quot; in 1879, the year he died.

Asked by a publisher to write an autobiography, Couture responded: &quot;Biography is the exaltation of personality—and personality is the scourge of our time.&quot;

===Death===
In 1879 he died at Villiers-le-Bel, Val-d&#x27;Oise, and was interred in Père Lachaise Cemetery, Paris.

==Selected paintings==
== Nazi-looted art in the Gurlitt collection ==
Couture’s &quot;Portrait of a Seated Woman&quot;, (c.1850-1855), discovered in the Gurlitt trove, was identified as having belonged to Georges Mandel from a small hole in the canvas. It was restituted to Mandel&#x27;s heirs in 2019.

<doc id="166080" wikidata="Q3310276" url="?curid=166080" title="Historicity of the Bible">
<text>The historicity of the Bible is the question of the Bible&#x27;s relationship to history—covering not just the Bible&#x27;s acceptability as history but also the ability to understand the literary forms of biblical narrative. Questions on biblical historicity are typically separated into evaluations of whether the Old Testament and Hebrew Bible accurately record the history of ancient Israel and Judah and the second Temple period, and whether the Christian New Testament is an accurate record of the historical Jesus and of the Apostolic Age. This tends to vary depending upon the opinion of the scholar.

When studying the books of the Bible, scholars examine the historical context of passages, the importance ascribed to events by the authors, and the contrast between the descriptions of these events and other historical evidence. Being a collaborative work composed and redacted over the course of several centuries, the historicity of the Bible is not consistent throughout the entirety of its contents.

According to theologian Thomas L. Thompson, a representative of the Copenhagen School, also known as &quot;biblical minimalism&quot;, the archaeological record lends sparse and indirect evidence for the Old Testament&#x27;s narratives as history. Others, like archaeologist William G. Dever, felt that biblical archaeology has both confirmed and challenged the Old Testament stories. While Dever has criticized the Copenhagen School for its more radical approach, he is far from being a biblical literalist, and thinks that the purpose of biblical archaeology is not to simply support or discredit the biblical narrative, but to be a field of study in its own right.

Some scholars argue that the Bible is national history, with an &quot;imaginative entertainment factor that proceeds from artistic expression&quot; or a &quot;midrash&quot; on history.

==Materials and methods==

===Manuscripts and canons===
The Bible exists in multiple manuscripts, none of them an autograph, and multiple biblical canons, which do not completely agree on which books have sufficient authority to be included or their order. The early discussions about the exclusion or integration of various apocrypha involve an early idea about the historicity of the core. The Ionian Enlightenment influenced early patrons like Justin Martyr and Tertullian—both saw the biblical texts as being different from (and having more historicity than) the myths of other religions. Augustine was aware of the difference between science and scripture and defended the historicity of the biblical texts, e.g., against claims of Faustus of Mileve.

Historians hold that the Bible should not be treated differently from other historical (or literary) sources from the ancient world. One may compare doubts about the historicity of, for example, Herodotus; the consequence of these discussions is not that historians shall have to stop using ancient sources for historical reconstruction, but need to be aware of the problems involved when doing so.

Very few texts survive directly from antiquity: most have been copied—some, many times. To determine the accuracy of a copied manuscript, textual critics examine the way the transcripts have passed through history to their forms. The higher the consistency of the earliest texts, the greater their textual reliability, and the less chance that the content has been changed over the years. Multiple copies may also be grouped into text types, with some types judged closer to the hypothetical original than others.

===Writing and reading history===

The meaning of the term &quot;history&quot; is itself dependent on social and historical context. Paula McNutt, for instance, notes that the Old Testament narratives, 
Even from the earliest times, students of religious texts had an awareness that parts of the scriptures could not be interpreted as a strictly consistent sequence of events. The Talmud cites a dictum ascribed to the third-century teacher Abba Arika that &quot;there is no chronological order in the Torah&quot;. Examples were often presented and discussed in later Jewish exegesis with, according to Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907–1972), an ongoing discourse between those who would follow the views of Rabbi Ishmael (born 90 CE) that &quot;the Torah speaks in human language&quot;, compared to the more mystical approach of Rabbi Akiva ( 50–135) that any such deviations should signpost some deeper order or purpose, to be divined.

During the modern era, the focus of biblical history has also diversified. The project of biblical archaeology associated with W.F. Albright (1891–1971), which sought to validate the historicity of the events narrated in the Bible through the ancient texts and material remains of the Near East, has a more specific focus compared to the more expansive view of history described by archaeologist William Dever (b. 1933). In discussing the role of his discipline in interpreting the biblical record, Dever has pointed to multiple histories within the Bible, including the history of theology (the relationship between God and believers), political history (usually the account of &quot;Great Men&quot;), narrative history (the chronology of events), intellectual history (treating ideas and their development, context and evolution), socio-cultural history (institutions, including their social underpinnings in family, clan, tribe and social class and the state), cultural history (overall cultural evolution, demography, socio-economic and political structure and ethnicity), technological history (the techniques by which humans adapt to, exploit and make use of the resources of their environment), natural history (how humans discover and adapt to the ecological facts of their natural environment), and material history (artifacts as correlates of changes in human behaviour).

Sharply differing perspectives on the relationship between narrative history and theological meaning present a special challenge for assessing the historicity of the Bible. Supporters of biblical literalism &quot;deny that Biblical infallibility and inerrancy are limited to spiritual, religious, or redemptive themes, exclusive of assertions in the fields of history and science. We further deny that scientific hypotheses about earth history may properly be used to overturn the teaching of Scripture on creation and the flood.&quot; &quot;History&quot;, or specifically biblical history, in this context appears to mean a definitive and finalized framework of events and actions—comfortingly familiar shared facts—like an omniscient medieval chronicle, shorn of alternative accounts, psychological interpretations, or literary pretensions. But prominent scholars have expressed diametrically opposing views: 

[T]he stories about the promise given to the patriarchs in Genesis are not historical, nor do they intend to be historical; they are rather historically determined expressions about Israel and Israel&#x27;s relationship to its God, given in forms legitimate to their time, and their truth lies not in their facticity, nor in the historicity, but their ability to express the reality that Israel experienced.

Modern professional historians, familiar with the phenomenon of on-going historical revisionism, allow new findings and ideas into their interpretations of &quot;what happened&quot;, and scholars versed in the study of texts (however sacred) see all narrators as potentially unreliable and all accounts—especially edited accounts—as potentially historically incomplete, biased by times and circumstances.

==Hebrew Bible/Old Testament==

===Authorship===
A central pillar of the Bible&#x27;s historical authority was the tradition that it had been composed by the principal actors or eyewitnesses to the events described—the Pentateuch was the work of Moses, the Book of Joshua was by Joshua, and so on. As early as the Middle Ages, scholars such as Abraham ibn Ezra noted internal contradictions that suggested the Pentateuch was not authored by Moses. For example, Moses could not have written an account of his own death in Deuteronomy 34.

These ideas became more common during the Protestant Reformation. The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes in his major work &quot;Leviathan&quot; (1651) argued that the biblical texts themselves provide significant evidence for when they were written. Readers, he notes, should be guided by what the text itself says rather than relying on later tradition: &quot;The light therefore that must guide us in this question, must be that which is held out unto us from the books themselves: and this light, though it shew us not the author of every book, yet it is not unuseful to give us knowledge of the time wherein they were written.&quot; Using such textual clues, Hobbes found it was impossible for Moses to have authored the Pentateuch. He also believed Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles were written long after the events they describe.

The Jewish philosopher and pantheist Baruch Spinoza echoed Hobbes&#x27;s doubts about the provenance of the historical books in his &quot;Tractatus Theologico-Politicus&quot; (published in 1670), and elaborated on the suggestion that the final redaction of these texts was post-exilic under the auspices of Ezra (Chapter IX). He had earlier been effectively excommunicated by the rabbinical council of Amsterdam for his perceived heresies. The French priest Richard Simon brought these critical perspectives to the Catholic tradition in 1678, observing &quot;the most part of the Holy Scriptures that are come to us, are but Abridgments and as Summaries of ancient Acts which were kept in the Registries of the Hebrews,&quot; in what was probably the first work of biblical textual criticism in the modern sense.

In response Jean Astruc, applying to the Pentateuch source criticism methods common in the analysis of classical secular texts, believed he could detect four different manuscript traditions, which he claimed Moses himself had redacted (p. 62–64). His 1753 book initiated the school known as higher criticism that culminated in Julius Wellhausen formalising the documentary hypothesis in the 1870s, which identifies these narratives as the Jahwist, Elohist, Deuteronomist, and the Priestly source. While versions of the documentary hypothesis vary in the order in which they were composed, the circumstances of their composition, and the date of their redaction(s), their shared terminology continues to provide the framework for modern theories on the composite nature and origins of the Torah.

By the end of the 19th century, the scholarly consensus was that the Pentateuch was the work of many authors writing from 1000 BCE (the time of David) to 500 BCE (the time of Ezra) and redacted , and as a consequence whatever history it contained was more often polemical than strictly factual—a conclusion reinforced by the then-fresh scientific refutations of what were at the time widely classed as biblical mythologies.

===Torah (Pentateuch)===

====Genesis creation narrative====
There is a Christian tradition of criticism of the creation narratives in Genesis dating back to at least St Augustine of Hippo (354–430), and Jewish tradition has also maintained a critical thread in its approach to biblical primeval history. The influential medieval philosopher Maimonides maintained a skeptical ambiguity toward creation &quot;ex nihilo&quot; and considered the stories about Adam more as &quot;philosophical anthropology, rather than as historical stories whose protagonist is the &#x27;first man&#x27;.&quot; Greek philosophers Aristotle, Critolaus and Proclus held that the world was eternal. Such interpretations are inconsistent with what was after the Protestant Reformation to be &quot;commonly perceived in evangelicalism as traditional views of Genesis&quot;.

The publication of James Hutton&#x27;s &quot;Theory of the Earth&quot; in 1788 was an important development in the scientific revolution that would dethrone Genesis as the ultimate authority on primeval earth and prehistory. The first casualty was the Creation story itself, and by the early 19th century &quot;no responsible scientist contended for the literal credibility of the Mosaic account of creation.&quot; The battle between uniformitarianism and catastrophism kept the flood alive in the emerging discipline, until Adam Sedgwick, the president of the Geological Society, publicly recanted his previous support in his 1831 presidential address:
We ought indeed to have paused before we first adopted the diluvian theory, and referred all our old superficial gravel to the action of the Mosaic Flood. For of man, and the works of his hands, we have not yet found a single trace among the remnants of the former world entombed in those deposits.

All of which left the &quot;first man&quot; and his putative descendants in the awkward position of being stripped of all historical context, until Charles Darwin naturalized the Garden of Eden with the publication of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; in 1859. Public acceptance of this scientific revolution was, at the time, uneven, but has since grown significantly. The mainstream scholarly community soon arrived at a consensus, which holds today, that Genesis 1–11 is a highly schematic literary work representing theology/symbolic mythology rather than actual history or science.

====The Patriarchs====

In the following decades Hermann Gunkel drew attention to the mythic aspects of the Pentateuch, and Albrecht Alt, Martin Noth and the tradition history school argued that although its core traditions had genuinely ancient roots, the narratives were fictional framing devices and were not intended as history in the modern sense. Though doubts have been cast on the historiographic reconstructions of this school (particularly the notion of oral traditions as a primary ancient source), much of its critique of biblical historicity found wide acceptance. Gunkel&#x27;s position is that

 This has in various forms become a commonplace of contemporary criticism.

In the United States the biblical archaeology movement, under the influence of Albright, counterattacked, arguing that the broad outline within the framing narratives was also true, so that while scholars could not realistically expect to prove or disprove individual episodes from the life of Abraham and the other patriarchs, these were real individuals who could be placed in a context proven from the archaeological record. But as more discoveries were made, and anticipated finds failed to materialise, it became apparent that archaeology did not in fact support the claims made by Albright and his followers.

Following Albright&#x27;s death, his interpretation of the patriarchal age came under increasing criticism: such dissatisfaction marked its culmination with the publication of &quot;The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives&quot; by Thomas L. Thompson and &quot;Abraham in History and Tradition&quot; by John Van Seters. Thompson, a literary scholar, argued on the lack of compelling evidence that the patriarchs lived in the 2nd millennium BCE, and noted how certain biblical texts reflected first millennium conditions and concerns, while Van Seters examined the patriarchal stories and argued that their names, social milieu, and messages strongly suggested that they were Iron Age creations. Van Seter and Thompson&#x27;s works were a paradigm shift in biblical scholarship and archaeology, which gradually led scholars to no longer consider the patriarchal narratives as historical. Some conservative scholars attempted to defend the patriarchal narratives in the following years, but this position has not found acceptance among scholars.

Nevertheless, some biblical scholars argue that the names of Patriarchs correspond to Amorite personal names typical of the Middle Bronze Age (2000 BCE – 1550 BCE) rather than to other names from later periods, which suggests that the Patriarchal narratives were based on traditions originating in the second millennium BCE. Other scholars argue that the narratives fit better the historical reality of the late Judahite monarchy. The narratives refer to camel-based traders carrying gum, balm, and myrrh, which they hold it is unlikely prior to the first millennium, as such activity only became common in the 8th–7th centuries BCE when Assyrian hegemony enabled this Arabian trade to flourish into a major industry. In 2013, excavations in the Timna Valley discovered what may be the earliest bones of domesticated camels found in Israel or even outside the Arabian peninsula, dating to around 930 BCE. This is seen as evidence that the stories of Abraham, Joseph, Jacob and Esau were written after this time. In 2021, Martin Heide and Joris Peters argued that camels were already domesticated in the early second millennium BCE and that their presence in the Patriarchal narratives was not anachronistic.

Today, although there continues to be some debate on the historical background of the narratives, many scholars (possibly most) reject the existence of the Patriarchal age. William Dever stated in 1993 that

=== The Exodus ===

Most mainstream scholars do not accept the biblical Exodus account as history for a number of reasons. It is generally agreed that the Exodus stories reached the current form centuries after the apparent setting of the stories. The Book of Exodus itself attempts to ground the event firmly in history, dating the exodus to the 2666th year after creation (Exodus 12:40–41), the construction of the tabernacle to year 2667 (Exodus 40:1–2, 17), stating that the Israelites dwelled in Egypt for 430 years (Exodus 12:40–41), and including place names such as Goshen (Gen. 46:28), Pithom and Ramesses (Exod. 1:11), as well as stating that 600,000 Israelite men were involved (Exodus 12:37). The Book of Numbers further states that the number of Israelites in the desert during the wandering were 603,550, including 22,273 first-borns, which modern estimates put at 2.5–3 million total Israelites, a clearly fanciful number that could never have been supported by the Sinai Desert. The geography is vague with regions such as Goshen unidentified, and there are internal problems with dating in the Pentateuch. No modern attempt to identify a historical Egyptian prototype for Moses has found wide acceptance, and no period in Egyptian history matches the biblical accounts of the Exodus. Some elements of the story are miraculous and defy rational explanation, such as the Plagues of Egypt and the Crossing of the Red Sea. The Bible also fails to mention the names of any of the pharaohs involved in the Exodus narrative.

While ancient Egyptian texts from the New Kingdom mention &quot;Asiatics&quot; living in Egypt as slaves and workers, these people cannot be securely connected to the Israelites, and no contemporary Egyptian text mentions a large-scale exodus of slaves like that described in the Bible. The earliest surviving historical mention of the Israelites, the Egyptian Merneptah Stele (), appears to place them in or around Canaan and gives no indication of any exodus.

Despite the absence of any archaeological evidence, a majority of scholars agree that the Exodus probably has some historical basis, with Kenton Sparks referring to it as &quot;mythologized history.&quot; Scholars posit that small groups of people of Egyptian origin may have joined the early Israelites, and then contributed their own Egyptian Exodus story to all of Israel. William G. Dever cautiously identifies this group with the Tribe of Joseph, while Richard Elliott Friedman identifies it with the Tribe of Levi. Most scholars who accept a historical core of the exodus date this possible exodus group to the thirteenth century BCE at the time of Ramses II, with some instead dating it to the twelfth century BCE at the time of Ramses III. Evidence in favor of historical traditions forming a background to the Exodus narrative include the documented movements of small groups of Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples into and out of Egypt during the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties, some elements of Egyptian folklore and culture in the Exodus narrative, and the names Moses, Aaron and Phinehas, which seem to have an Egyptian origin. 

Scholarly estimates for how many people could have been involved in such an exodus range from a few hundred to a few thousand people.

Donald Redford held that the Exodus narrative is a Canaanite memory of the Hyksos&#x27; descent and occupation of Egypt.

===Deuteronomistic history===
Many scholars believe that the Deuteronomistic history preserved elements of ancient texts and oral tradition, including geo-political and socio-economic realities and certain information about historical figures and events. However, large portions of it are legendary and it contains many anachronisms.

====The &quot;conquest narrative&quot; in Joshua and Judges====
A major issue in the historicity debate was the narrative of the Israelite conquest of Canaan, described in Joshua and Judges. The American Albright school asserted that the biblical narrative of conquest would be affirmed by archaeological record; and indeed for much of the 20th century archaeology appeared to support the biblical narrative, including excavations at Beitin (identified as Bethel), Tel ed-Duweir, (identified as Lachish), Hazor, and Jericho.

However, flaws in the conquest narrative appeared. The most high-profile example was the &quot;fall of Jericho&quot;, excavated by John Garstang in the 1930s. Garstang originally announced that he had found fallen walls dating to the time of the biblical Battle of Jericho, but later revised the destruction to a much earlier period. Kathleen Kenyon dated the destruction of the walled city to the middle of the 16th century ( 1550 BCE), too early to match the usual dating of the Exodus to Pharaoh Ramses, on the basis of her excavations in the early 1950s. The same conclusion, based on an analysis of all the excavation findings, was reached by Piotr Bienkowski. By the 1960s it had become clear that the archaeological record did not, in fact, support the account of the conquest given in Joshua: the cities which the Bible records as having been destroyed by the Israelites were either uninhabited at the time, or, if destroyed, were destroyed at widely different times, not in one brief period.

The consensus for the conquest narrative was eventually abandoned in the late 20th century.

&quot;Peake&#x27;s Commentary on the Bible&quot; argues that the Book of Joshua conflates several independent battles between disparate groups over the centuries, and artificially attributes them to a single leader, Joshua. However, there are a few cases where the biblical record is not contradicted by the archaeological record. For example, stratum in Tel Hazor, found in a destruction layer from around 1200 BCE, shows signs of catastrophic fire, and cuneiform tablets found at the site refer to monarchs named &quot;Ibni Addi&quot;, where &quot;Ibni&quot; may be the etymological origin of &quot;Yavin&quot; (&quot;Jabin&quot;), the Canaanite leader referred to in the Hebrew Bible. The city also shows signs of having been a magnificent Canaanite city prior to its destruction, with great temples and opulent palaces, split into an upper acropolis and lower city; the town evidently had been a major Canaanite city. Israel Finkelstein theorized that the destruction of Hazor was the result of civil strife, attacks by the Sea Peoples or a result of the general collapse of civilization across the whole eastern Mediterranean in the Late Bronze Age, rather than being caused by the Israelites.

Amnon Ben-Tor (Hebrew University of Jerusalem) believes that recently unearthed evidence of violent destruction by burning verifies the biblical account. In 2012, a team led by Ben-Tor and Sharon Zuckerman discovered a scorched palace from the 13th century BC in whose storerooms they found 3,400-year-old ewers holding burned crops; however, Sharon Zuckerman did not agree with Ben-Tor&#x27;s theory, and claimed that the burning was the result of the city&#x27;s numerous factions opposing each other with excessive force. Biblical scholar Richard Elliot Friedman (University of Georgia) argues that the Israelites did destroy Hazor, but that such destruction fits better with the account of the Book of Judges, in which the prophetess Deborah defeats the king of Hazor.

====Books of Samuel====
The Books of Samuel are considered to be based on both historical and legendary sources, primarily serving to fill the gap in Israelite history after the events described in Deuteronomy. According to Donald Redford, the Books of Samuel exhibit too many anachronisms to have been compiled in the 11th century BCE. For example, there is mention of later armor (), use of camels (), and cavalry (as distinct from chariotry; , ), iron picks and axes (as though they were common; ), and sophisticated siege techniques (). There is a gargantuan troop called up (), a battle with 20,000 casualties (), and a reference to Kushite paramilitary and servants, clearly giving evidence of a date in which Kushites were common, after the 26th Dynasty of Egypt, the period of the last quarter of the 8th century BCE. Alan Millard argues that those elements of the Biblical narrative are not anachronistic.

====United Monarchy====

Much of the focus of modern criticism has been the historicity of the United Monarchy of Israel, which according to the Hebrew Bible ruled over both Judea and Samaria around the 10th century BCE.

The minimalist Thomas L. Thompson has written:

In Iron Age IIa (corresponding to the Monarchal period) Judah seems to have been limited to small, mostly rural and unfortified settlements in the Judean hills. This contrasts to the upper Samaria which was becoming urbanized. This archaeological evidence as well as textual criticism has led many modern historians to treat Israel as arising separately from Judah and as distinct albeit related entities centered at Shechem and Jerusalem, respectively, and not as a united kingdom with a capital in Jerusalem.

Excavations at Khirbet Qeiyafa, an Iron Age site located in Judah, support the biblical account of a United Monarchy. The Israel Antiquities Authority stated: &quot;The excavations at Khirbat Qeiyafa clearly reveal an urban society that existed in Judah already in the late eleventh century BCE. It can no longer be argued that the Kingdom of Judah developed only in the late eighth century BCE or at some other later date.&quot;

The status of Jerusalem in the 10th century BCE is a major subject of debate. The oldest part of Jerusalem and its original urban core is the City of David, which does show evidence of significant Judean residential activity around the 10th century. Some unique administrative structures such as the Stepped Stone Structure and the Large Stone Structure, which originally formed one structure, contain material culture dated to Iron I. On account of the alleged lack of settlement activity in the 10th century BCE, Israel Finkelstein argues that Jerusalem in the century was a small country village in the Judean hills, not a national capital, and Ussishkin argues that the city was entirely uninhabited. Amihai Mazar contends that if the Iron I/Iron IIa dating of administrative structures in the City of David are correct (as he believes), &quot;Jerusalem was a rather small town with a mighty citadel, which could have been a center of a substantial regional polity.&quot;

It has been argued that recent archaeological discoveries at the City of David and the Ophel seem to indicate that Jerusalem was sufficiently developed as a city to be the capital of the United Monarchy in the 10th century BCE.

Since the discovery of the Tel Dan Stele dated to the 9th or 8th century BCE containing &quot;bytdwd&quot;, interpreted by many as a reference to the &quot;House of David&quot; as a monarchic dynasty in Judah (another possible reference occurs in the Mesha Stele), the majority of scholars accept the existence of a polity ruled by David and Solomon, albeit on a more modest scale than described in the Bible. Most scholars believe that David and Solomon reigned over large sections of Cisjordan and probably parts of Transjordan. William G. Dever argues that David only reigned over the current territories of Israel and West Bank and that he did defeat the invading Philistines, but that the other conquests are fictitious.

==New Testament==

===Historicity of Jesus===

The majority of modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, and that he was crucified by order of Roman prefect Pontius Pilate. The &quot;quest for the historical Jesus&quot; began as early as the 18th century, and has continued to this day. The most notable recent scholarship came in the 1980s and 1990s, with the work of J. D. Crossan, James D. G. Dunn, John P. Meier, E. P. Sanders and N. T. Wright being the most widely read and discussed. Other works on the matter were published by Dale Allison, Bart D. Ehrman, Richard Bauckham and Maurice Casey.

The earliest New Testament texts which refer to Jesus, the Pauline epistles, are usually dated in the 50s CE. Since Paul records very little of Jesus&#x27; life and activities, these are of little help in determining facts about the life of Jesus, although they may contain references to information given to Paul from the eyewitnesses of Jesus.

The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls has shed light into the context of 1st century Judea, noting the diversity of Jewish belief as well as shared expectations and teachings. For example, the expectation of the coming messiah, the beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount and much else of the early Christian movement are found to have existed within apocalyptic Judaism of the period. This has had the effect of centering Early Christianity much more within its Jewish roots than was previously the case. It is now recognised that Rabbinic Judaism and Early Christianity are only two of the many strands which survived until the Jewish revolt of 66 to 70 CE.

Most historical critics agree that a historical figure named Jesus taught in the Galilean countryside , was believed by his followers to have performed supernatural acts, and was sentenced to death by the Romans, possibly for insurrection.

====Miracles of Jesus====
Scholars are divided on the matter of miracles with no consensus on their historicity; some ruling them out a priori, others defending the possibility of miracles, and others defending them outright. New Testament scholar Bart Ehrman argues that though some historians believe that miracles have happened and others do not, due to the limitations of the sources, it is not possible for historians to affirm or deny them. He states &quot;This is not a problem for only one kind of historian—for atheists or agnostics or Buddhists or Roman Catholics or Baptists or Jews or Muslims; it is a problem for all historians of every stripe. According to Mike Licona, among general historians there are some postmodern views of historiography that are open to the investigation of miracles.

====Burial====
In the gospel accounts, the resurrection tradition appears in Mark 16, Matthew 28, Luke 24, and John 20 to 21 where the risen Jesus appears to different people after his tomb was found empty by women. A topic of debate among scholars is whether Jesus was ever buried in a tomb, and if such a tomb was indeed found empty. An argument in favor of a decent burial before sunset is the Jewish custom, based on the Torah, that the body of an executed person should not remain on the tree where the corpse was hung for public display, but be buried before sunrise. This is based on , but also attested in the Temple Scroll of the Essenes, and in Josephus&#x27; &quot;Jewish War&quot; 4.5.2§317, describing the burial of crucified Jewish insurgents before sunset.

Scholars such as Bart Ehrman and John Dominic Crossan doubt that Jesus had a decent burial, or that the disciples even knew what had happened to his body. Ehrman argues that crucifixion was meant &quot;to torture and humiliate a person as fully as possible&quot;, and the body was normally left on the stake to be eaten by animals. Ehrman further argues that criminals were usually buried in common graves, and Pilate had no concern for Jewish sensitivities, which makes it unlikely that he would have allowed for Jesus to be buried.

In contrast, James Dunn argues that the burial tradition is &quot;one of the oldest pieces of tradition we have&quot;, referring to 1 Cor. 15.4; burial was in line with Jewish custom as prescribed by Deut. 21.22-23 and confirmed by Josephus War; cases of burial of crucified persons are known, as attested by the Jehohanan burial; Joseph of Arimathea &quot;is a very plausible historical character&quot;; and &quot;the presence of the women at the cross and their involvement in Jesus&#x27; burial can be attributed more plausibly to early oral memory than to creative story-telling&quot;. Similarly, Dale Allison, reviewing the arguments of Crossan and Ehrman, considers their assertions strong but &quot;find[s] it likely that a man named Joseph, probably a Sanhedrist, from the obscure Arimathea, sought and obtained permission from the Roman authorities to make arrangements for Jesus’ hurried burial.&quot;

According to religion professor John Granger Cook, there are historical texts that mention mass graves, but they contain no indication of those bodies being dug up by animals. There is no mention of an open pit or shallow graves in any Roman text. There are a number of historical texts outside the gospels showing the bodies of the crucified dead were buried by family or friends. Cook writes that &quot;those texts show that the narrative of Joseph of Arimethaea&#x27;s burial of Jesus would be perfectly comprehensible to a Greco-Roman reader of the gospels and historically credible.&quot;

====Empty tomb and resurrection appearances====
Scholars have tackled the question of establishing what contents of the resurrection tradition are historically probable. For example, it is widely accepted among New Testament scholars that Jesus&#x27; followers soon came to believe they had seen him resurrected shortly after his death. Robert Funk writes that &quot;the disciples thought that they had witnessed Jesus’ appearances, which, however they are explained, “is a fact upon which both believer and unbeliever may agree.&quot;

Most scholars believe that John wrote independently of Mark and that the Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John contain two independent attestations of an empty tomb, which in turn suggests that both used already-existing sources and appealed to a commonly held tradition, though Mark may have added to and adapted that tradition to fit his narrative. Other scholars have argued that the Apostle Paul is aware of an empty tomb in his earlier creed in 1 Cor. 15 and thereby corroborating the gospel accounts.

Scholars have identified legendary or unoriginal details within the resurrection tradition. For example, the story of the guards at the tomb in Matthew 27 is &quot;widely regarded as an apologetic legend&quot; meant to refute Jewish critics. Quoting a published dissertation on the empty tomb tradition in Mark, Mike Licona writes that “not a few, but rather a majority, of contemporary scholars believe that there is some historical kernel in the empty tomb tradition.&quot;

According to Geza Vermes, &quot;had the accounts been the products of wholesale manufacturing, it is highly unlikely that they would have provided female witnesses who “had no standing in a male-dominated Jewish society.” Moreover, they would have gotten the number of women in the various narratives correct. In short, had the narratives been the result of complete invention, they would have been more uniform and they would have included credible witnesses. In contrast, Bart D. Ehrman rejects the story of the empty tomb, and argues that &quot;an empty tomb had nothing to do with [belief in the resurrection] [...] an empty tomb would not produce faith&quot;. Ehrman argues that the empty tomb was needed to underscore the physical resurrection of Jesus.

As with miracles, there is no single approach by scholars to the question of the resurrection of Jesus and if it really happened or not. &quot;Historical Jesus&quot; scholars in general tend to avoid the topic since many believe the matter to be about faith, or lack thereof. Nevertheless, scholars have sought to make their own cases for and against the historicity of the resurrection. Skeptical scholars generally argue that the resurrection appearances were caused by hallucinations. For example, Gerd Lüdemann argues that Peter had a vision of Jesus, induced by his feelings of guilt for betraying Jesus. The vision elevated this feeling of guilt, and Peter experienced it as a real appearance of Jesus, raised from dead. However, scholars such as N.T. Wright and Dale Allison, among others, argue that hallucinations would not lead or correspond to a belief in resurrection. In contrast to the skeptical view, Christian biblical scholars typically argue for a historical, physical resurrection of Jesus based on biblical evidence. For example, scholars such as Mike Licona argue that the diversity of different witnesses, such as skeptics Paul and James, are of important value to historians and, writing further, that attempts to downplay such value don&#x27;t work. According to Wright, there is substantial unanimity among the early Christian writers (first and second century) that Jesus had been bodily raised from the dead.

===Historicity of the Gospels===

Most modern scholars hold that the canonical gospel accounts were written between 70 and 100, four to eight decades after the crucifixion, although based on earlier traditions and texts, such as &quot;Q&quot;, Logia or &quot;sayings gospels&quot;, the passion account or other earlier literature (See List of Gospels). Some scholars argue that these accounts were compiled by witnesses although this view is disputed by other scholars.

Some scholars believe that the Gospel of Mark shows signs of a lack of knowledge of geographical, political and religious matters in Judea in the time of Jesus. Thus, today the most common opinion is that the author is unknown and both geographically and historically at a distance from the narrated events; however, opinion varies, and scholars such as Craig Blomberg accept the more traditional view. J. A. Lloyd argues that recent archaeological research in the Galilee region shows that Jesus&#x27; itinerary as depicted by Mark is historically and geographically plausible. The use of expressions that may be described as awkward and rustic cause the Gospel of Mark to appear somewhat unlettered or even crude. This may be attributed to the influence that Saint Peter, a fisherman, is suggested to have on the writing of Mark. It is commonly thought that the writers of the Gospel of Matthew and Gospel of Luke used Mark as a source, with changes and improvement to peculiarities and crudities in Mark.

===Historicity of Acts===

Archaeological inscriptions and other independent sources show that Acts contains some accurate details of 1st century society with regard to titles of officials, administrative divisions, town assemblies, and rules of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem. However, the historicity of the depiction of Paul the Apostle in Acts is contested. Acts describes Paul differently from how Paul describes himself, both factually and theologically. Acts differs from Paul&#x27;s letters on important issues, such as the Law, Paul&#x27;s own apostleship, and his relation to the Jerusalem church. Scholars generally prefer Paul&#x27;s account over that in Acts.

==Schools of archaeological and historical thought==

===Overview of academic views===

According to Spencer Mizen of &quot;BBC History Magazine&quot;, &quot;The origins of the Bible are still cloaked in mystery. When was it written? Who wrote it? And how reliable is it as an historical record?&quot;

An educated reading of the biblical text requires knowledge of when it was written, by whom, and for what purpose. For example, many academics would agree that the Pentateuch was in existence some time shortly after the 6th century BCE, but they disagree about when it was written. Proposed dates vary from the 15th century BCE to the 6th century BCE. One popular hypothesis points to the reign of Josiah (7th century BCE). In this hypothesis, the events of, for example, Exodus would have happened centuries before they were finally edited.

The documentary hypothesis claims, using the biblical evidence itself, to demonstrate that the current version of the Bible is based on older written sources that are lost. It has been modified heavily over the years, and some scholars accept some form of this hypothesis. There have also been and are a number of scholars who reject it, for example Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen and Old Testament scholar Walter Kaiser, Jr., as well as R. N. Whybray, Umberto Cassuto, O. T. Allis, Gleason Archer, John Sailhamer, Bruce Waltke, and Joshua Berman.

===Maximalist–minimalist dichotomy===
There is great scholarly controversy on the historicity of events recounted in the biblical narratives prior to the Babylonian captivity in the 6th century BCE. There is a split between scholars who reject the biblical account of Ancient Israel as fundamentally ahistorical, and those who accept it as a largely reliable source of history—termed biblical minimalists and biblical maximalists, respectively. The major split of biblical scholarship into two opposing schools is strongly disapproved by non-fundamentalist biblical scholars, as being an attempt by conservative Christians to portray the field as a bipolar argument, of which only one side is correct. &quot;The Quest for the Historical Israel&quot; by Israel Finkelstein et al attempted to be more balanced.

===Biblical minimalism===

The viewpoint sometimes called biblical minimalism generally holds that the Bible is principally a theological and apologetic work. The early stories are held to have a historical basis that was reconstructed centuries later, which are supported by archaeological discoveries. In this view, the stories about the biblical patriarchs are believed to be fictional. Furthermore, biblical minimalists hold that the twelve tribes of Israel were a later construction, the stories of King David and King Saul were modeled upon later Irano-Hellenistic examples, believing that the united Kingdom of Israel—where the Bible says that David and Solomon ruled over an empire from the Euphrates to Eilath— never existed.

It is hard to pinpoint when the movement started but 1968 seems to be a reasonable date. During this year, two prize-winning essays were written in Copenhagen; one by Niels Peter Lemche, the other by Heike Friis, which advocated a complete rethinking of the way we approach the Bible and attempt to draw historical conclusions from it.

In published books, one of the early advocates of the current school of thought known as biblical minimalism is Giovanni Garbini, (1986), translated into English as &quot;History and Ideology in Ancient Israel&quot; (1988). In his footsteps followed Thomas L. Thompson with his lengthy &quot;Early History of the Israelite People: From the Written &amp; Archaeological Sources&quot; (1992) and, building explicitly on Thompson&#x27;s book, P. R. Davies&#x27; shorter work, &quot;In Search of &#x27;Ancient Israel&quot;&#x27; (1992). In the latter, Davies finds historical Israel only in archaeological remains, biblical Israel only in scripture, and recent reconstructions of &quot;ancient Israel&quot; to be an unacceptable amalgam of the two. Thompson and Davies see the entire Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) as the imaginative creation of a small community of Jews at Jerusalem during the period which the Bible assigns to after the return from the Babylonian exile, from 539 BCE onward. Niels Peter Lemche, Thompson&#x27;s fellow faculty member at the University of Copenhagen, also followed with several titles that show Thompson&#x27;s influence, including &quot;The Israelites in history and tradition&quot; (1998). The presence of both Thompson and Lemche at the same institution has led to the use of the term &quot;Copenhagen school&quot;. The effect of biblical minimalism from 1992 onward was debate with more than two points of view.

===Biblical maximalism===

There is great scholarly controversy on the historicity particularly of those events recounted in the biblical narratives prior to the Babylonian captivity in the 6th century BCE. Regarding the debate over the historicity of ancient Israel, the maximalist position holds that the accounts of the United Monarchy and the early kings of Israel, David and Saul, are to be taken as largely historical.

===Decreasing conflict===
In 2001, Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman published &quot;The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology&#x27;s New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts&quot; which advocated a view midway toward biblical minimalism and caused an uproar among many conservatives. In the 25th anniversary issue of &quot;Biblical Archaeology Review&quot; (March/April 2001 edition), editor Hershel Shanks quoted several biblical scholars who insisted that minimalism was dying, although leading minimalists deny this and a claim has been made &quot;We are all minimalists now&quot; (an allusion to &quot;We are all Keynesians now&quot;).

However, other more mainstream scholars have rejected these claims:

In 2003, Kenneth Kitchen, a scholar who adopts a more maximalist point of view, authored the book &quot;On the Reliability of the Old Testament&quot;. Kitchen advocated the reliability of many (although not all) parts of the Torah and in no uncertain terms criticizes the work of Finkelstein and Silberman.

Jennifer Wallace describes archaeologist Israel Finkelstein&#x27;s view in her article &quot;Shifting Ground in the Holy Land&quot;, appearing in &quot;Smithsonian Magazine&quot;, May 2006:

However, despite problems with the archaeological record, some maximalists place Joshua in the mid-second millennium, at about the time the Egyptian Empire came to rule over Canaan, and not the 13th century as Finkelstein or Kitchen claim, and view the destruction layers of the period as corroboration of the biblical account. The destruction of Hazor in the mid-13th century is seen as corroboration of the biblical account of the later destruction carried out by Deborah and Barak as recorded in the Book of Judges. The location that Finkelstein refers to as &quot;Ai&quot; is generally dismissed as the location of the biblical Ai, since it was destroyed and buried in the 3rd millennium. The prominent site has been known by that name since at least Hellenistic times, if not before. Minimalists all hold that dating these events as contemporary are etiological explanations written centuries after the events they claim to report.

Both Finkelstein and Silberman do accept that David and Solomon were really existing persons (not kings but bandit leaders or hill country chieftains) from Judah about the 10th century BCE, but they do not assume that there was such a thing as United Monarchy with a capital in Jerusalem.

Others, such as David Ussishkin, argue that those who follow the biblical depiction of a United Monarchy do so on the basis of limited evidence while hoping to uncover real archaeological proof in the future. Gunnar Lehmann suggests that there is still a possibility that David and Solomon were able to become local chieftains of some importance and claims that Jerusalem at the time was at best a small town in a sparsely populated area in which alliances of tribal kinship groups formed the basis of society. He goes on further to claim that it was at best a small regional centre, one of three to four in the territory of Judah and neither David nor Solomon had the manpower or the requisite social/political/administrative structure to rule the kind of empire described in the Bible.

These views are strongly criticized by William G. Dever, Helga Weippert, Amihai Mazar and Amnon Ben-Tor. Dever stated that in the 10th century BCE Judah was an &quot;early inchoate state&quot; that would later be fully consolidated in the 9th century BCE, while following the split of the United Monarchy northern Israel had a separate development in the 9th century BCE.

André Lemaire states in &quot;Ancient Israel: From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple&quot; that the principal points of the biblical tradition with Solomon are generally trustworthy. Kenneth Kitchen shares this view, arguing that Solomon ruled over a comparatively wealthy &quot;mini-empire&quot;, rather than a small city-state. Avraham Faust and Zev Farber have also argued that archaeological evidence supports the idea that David and Solomon ruled over a mini-empire.

Recently, Finkelstein has joined with the more conservative Amihai Mazar to explore the areas of agreement and disagreement and there are signs the intensity of the debate between the so-called minimalist and maximalist scholars is diminishing. This view is also taken by Richard S. Hess, which shows there is in fact a plurality of views between maximalists and minimalists. Jack Cargill has shown that popular textbooks not only fail to give readers up-to-date archaeological evidence, but that they also fail to correctly represent the diversity of views present on the subject. Megan Bishop Moore and Brad E. Kelle provide an overview of the respective evolving approaches and attendant controversies, especially during the period from the mid-1980s through 2011, in their book &quot;Biblical History and Israel&#x27;s Past&quot;.

<text>The Ink Spots were an American vocal pop group who gained international fame in the 1930s and 1940s. Their unique musical style predated the rhythm and blues and rock and roll musical genres, and the subgenre doo-wop. The Ink Spots were widely accepted in both the white and black communities, largely due to the ballad style introduced to the group by lead singer Bill Kenny.

In 1989, the Ink Spots (Bill Kenny, Charlie Fuqua, Deek Watson, Jerry Daniels, and Orville Jones) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 1999 they were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. Since the Ink Spots disbanded in 1954, there have been well over a hundred vocal groups calling themselves &quot;The Ink Spots&quot;, with and without any original members of the group. It has often been the case that these groups claimed to be &quot;second generation&quot; or &quot;third generation&quot; Ink Spots.

==1930s==
===Early background of founding members===
Daniels and Fuqua formed a vocal duo called &quot;Jerry and Charlie&quot;, and performed in the Indianapolis area around 1931. About the same time, Jones and Watson were part of a quartet, &quot;The Four Riff Brothers&quot;, who appeared regularly on radio station WLW in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1933, that group disbanded, and Watson, Daniels and Fuqua got together to form a new vocal, instrumental and comedy group, initially called &quot;King, Jack, and Jester&quot;. They continued to appear regularly on radio in Ohio, and became a quartet when Jones joined the following year.

In July 1934, they accepted a booking at the Apollo Theater, New York, supporting jazz bandleader Tiny Bradshaw. At this point they had changed their name to &quot;The 4 Ink Spots&quot;. Later that year, the Ink Spots achieved international success touring the UK with Jack Hylton&#x27;s Orchestra, one review in the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; stating:
They first recorded for Victor Records in 1935. Their early recordings included such songs as &quot;Swingin&#x27; On The Strings&quot;, &quot;Your Feet&#x27;s Too Big&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t &#x27;Low No Swingin&#x27; In Here&quot; and &quot;Swing, Gate, Swing&quot;. Despite their rising popularity as performers, their early records were not commercially successful.

===Bill Kenny joins===
In 1936, Daniels was replaced by a 21-year-old singer from Baltimore, Bill Kenny, who signed on with the Ink Spots after winning first place in an amateur contest at Harlem&#x27;s Savoy Ballroom. Three years later, Kenny was credited for bringing the group to global success with his unusual high tenor ballad singing.

In 1938, after being in the group for two years, Kenny started to introduce the group to a new format that he called &quot;Top &amp; Bottom&quot;. This format was used primarily for ballads rather than the uptempo &quot;jive&quot; songs the group was used to performing. This format called for the tenor (Kenny or Watson) to sing the lead for one chorus followed by a chorus performed by bass singer Jones reciting the lyrics rather than singing them. After a chorus of the &quot;talking bass&quot; the lead tenor sang the rest of the song until the end. The earliest example of their &quot;Top &amp; Bottom&quot; format is from a radio broadcast from 1938. The song, titled &quot;Tune In on My Heart&quot;, features Kenny taking the lead and Jones performing the talking bass.

Also in 1938, Kenny took his first feature solo in Decca studios. His feature was on a song titled &quot;I Wish You the Best of Everything&quot;. Although not in the &quot;Top &amp; Bottom&quot; format, it was a ballad and used the signature Ink Spots guitar intro. Even though it got a good response, it was not very successful in terms of record sales and did not reach the pop chart.

===&quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Care&quot; and the late 1930s===

On January 12, 1939, the Ink Spots entered Decca studios to record a ballad written by a young songwriter named Jack Lawrence. This ballad, &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Care&quot;, was to be one of their biggest hits, selling over 19 million copies and becoming the 8th-best-selling single of all time. This is the first studio recorded example of the Ink Spots &quot;Top &amp; Bottom&quot; format with Kenny singing lead and Jones performing the &quot;talking bass&quot;. For this recording, each member was paid $37.50; after the record sold 200,000 copies, however, Decca destroyed the original contract and the group was paid an additional $3,750. This was the recording that brought the group to global fame and established the &quot;Top &amp; Bottom&quot; format as the Ink Spots &quot;trademark&quot;. From 1939 until the group&#x27;s disbanding in 1954, many of their songs employed this format.
The year 1939 also saw the Ink Spots enjoy commercial success with five other recordings that featured Kenny in the &quot;Top &amp; Bottom&quot; format. Their most successful hit of 1939 was the Lombardo, Marks &amp; Hill ballad, &quot;Address Unknown&quot;. Other successful hits from 1939 and early 1940 included &quot;My Prayer&quot;, &quot;Bless You&quot;, &quot;Memories of You&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Gettin&#x27; Sentimental Over You&quot;.

==1940s==
===Recordings===
Between the years 1940 and 1949 the Ink Spots landed well over 30 hits on the US Pop Charts with 18 of them on the top 10. The group’s first Billboard #1 hit came in 1944, when they teamed up with Ella Fitzgerald to record &quot;I&#x27;m Making Believe&quot;. This recording featured Bill Kenny. In 1946, the Ink Spots earned another #1 spot on the US Pop Charts with &quot;To Each His Own&quot;. The Billy Reid composition &quot;The Gypsy&quot; was the Ink Spots&#x27; biggest chart success, staying at the #1 position on the Billboard Best Sellers chart for 10 straight weeks in 1946.

Other hits for the Ink Spots in the 1940s included &quot;When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano&quot;, &quot;Maybe&quot;, &quot;We Three&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Set the World on Fire&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Around Much Anymore&quot;, &quot;A Lovely Way to Spend an Evening&quot;, &quot;Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Beginning to See the Light&quot;.

===Films===
In 1941, the Ink Spots were featured in &quot;The Great American Broadcast&quot; starring John Payne and Alice Faye. In the film, the Ink Spots play Pullman porters who sing during their breaks and ultimately &quot;make it big time&quot; and sing live on the radio during a national broadcast. The group sings a short segment of &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Care&quot;, &quot;Alabamy Bound&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Bone to Pick with You&quot;. They also provide background vocals to Faye and Payne on a ballad entitled &quot;Where You Are&quot;.

The following year, the Ink Spots were featured in an Abbott and Costello film, &quot;Pardon My Sarong&quot;. In this film, the Ink Spots play singing waiters in a nightclub. They sing the ballad &quot;Do I Worry?&quot; and the swing song &quot;Shout Brother Shout&quot;.

===Line-up changes===

In 1943, Ink Spots baritone singer and guitarist Fuqua was drafted into the US Army. He chose his friend Bernie Mackey to be his temporary replacement until he returned to the group. After being with the group for two years, Mackey was replaced by Huey Long in March 1945. Long completed the role as a &quot;fill in&quot; until Fuqua finally returned in October 1945.

Jones died in October 1944, after collapsing on stage at the Cafe Zanzibar in New York City, near the height of the Ink Spots&#x27; popularity. He had been having cerebral hemorrhages for a year, and had fallen ill from the condition in June 1944. Jones was temporarily replaced by Cliff Givens, who filled in from October 1944 to March 1945, before a permanent replacement was found in Bill Kenny&#x27;s brother (and fraternal twin) Herb Kenny. Herb Kenny sang with the group from 1945 to 1951, when he began a career as a solo artist. The last bass singer in the Ink Spots was Adriel McDonald, who was with the group from 1951 to 1954. McDonald was previously the Ink Spots&#x27; personal valet, a job given to him by Herb Kenny, with whom he had sung in a group called &quot;The Cabineers&quot; in the early 1940s.

Due to personality clashes between Bill Kenny and Watson after Jones&#x27; death, Kenny decided he would rather carry on as the leader of the group and bought Watson&#x27;s share of the group for $10,000, which gave him the power to kick Watson out of the group. Watson went on to form a group similar in style to the Ink Spots called the Brown Dots (which later became the Four Tunes), and his place was filled by Billy &quot;Butterball&quot; Bowen, who sang with the Ink Spots from 1944 to 1952.

==1950s==
===Final years===
In 1952, Fuqua left the group to form his own vocal group using the name &quot;Ink Spots&quot;. At this time, Kenny and Fuqua each owned 50% of the Ink Spots, and it was decided by court ruling that Kenny&#x27;s group was to continue on as the original &quot;Ink Spots&quot;, while Fuqua&#x27;s group was to use the name &quot;Charlie Fuqua&#x27;s New Ink Spots&quot;. Defying the court ruling, Fuqua instead called his group the &quot;Original&quot; Ink Spots.

Fuqua was replaced in the Ink Spots by popular jazz and R&amp;B guitarist Everett Barksdale, so the group now consisted of Bill Kenny (lead tenor), Teddy Williams (second tenor), who had replaced Bowen, Everett Barksdale (baritone and guitar), and McDonald (bass). After being with the group for only a few months, Williams was replaced by Ernie Brown. Barksdale stayed with the group for about a year before being replaced by baritone vocalist and guitar player named Jimmy Cannady. This line-up of Kenny (lead tenor), Brown (second tenor), Cannady (baritone and guitar), and McDonald (bass) lasted until 1954, when the final change of lineup was made.

In April 1954, Brown was replaced by Henry Braswell, who sang with the Ink Spots for their final three months. Kenny officially disbanded the Ink Spots in July 1954, after an appearance at the Bolero Bar in Wildwood, New Jersey.

===Timeline===
====1931–1954====

==Non-original Ink Spots groups==
Disputes over the rights to use the Ink Spots name began in the late 1940s, resulting in many court cases. Starting in 1954, groups calling themselves &quot;The Ink Spots&quot; sprang up all around the United States. Some groups contained original members Fuqua, McDonald, Bowen, or Watson, but most had no ties to the original group whatsoever. Many groups claimed to have the rights to the name, but no one did. Still, lawsuits were filed between various groups and there was great confusion as to who owned the naming rights. Some groups avoided lawsuits by naming themselves &quot;The Fabulous Ink Spots&quot;, &quot;The Famous Ink Spots&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Ink Spots&quot;, &quot;The Sensational Ink Spots&quot;, &quot;The Dynamic Ink Spots&quot;, and more.

According to writer Marv Goldberg: &quot;The original group was a partnership, not a corporation, and that influenced judge Isidor Wasservogel to say, in 1955, that when Hoppy Jones died in 1944, it effectively served to terminate the partnership and that no one could truthfully use the name after that.&quot; From 1954 to the present, more than 100 groups have used the name &quot;The Ink Spots&quot;. In 1967 US federal judge Emmet C. Choate ruled that since so many groups had been using the name &quot;Ink Spots&quot; it had become &quot;public domain&quot; and was free for anyone to use.

===Charlie Fuqua&#x27;s Ink Spots===
In 1952, Fuqua left the original Ink Spots led by Kenny to form his own Ink Spots group. Fuqua recorded dozens of singles with his group for King Records as well as releasing two LP (long play) albums for Verve Records. In 1963 Fuqua&#x27;s group also recorded one 45 RPM record for Ford Records. Fuqua led and was a member of various vocal groups calling themselves &quot;The Ink Spots&quot; until his death in 1971.

===Deek Watson&#x27;s Ink Spots===
Watson, who had been forced out of the original Ink Spots in 1944 and briefly sang with Charlie Fuqua&#x27;s Ink Spots in 1952–1953, started his own vocal group using the name &quot;The Ink Spots&quot; in 1954. Watson made numerous recordings with his &quot;Ink Spots&quot; groups in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of the recordings Watson made with his groups were released and re-released on various low budget labels. Watson led various groups until his death in 1969.

==Legitimate members of the Ink Spots==
Legitimate members of the Ink Spots included Bill Kenny, Jerry Daniels, Deek Watson, Charlie Fuqua, Hoppy Jones, Bernie Mackey, Huey Long, Cliff Givens, Billy Bowen, Herb Kenny, Adriel McDonald, Jimmy Cannady, Ernie Brown, Henry Braswell, Teddy Williams and Everett Barksdale. Pianists and arrangers included Bob Benson, Asa &quot;Ace&quot; Harris, Ken Bryan, Mort Howard (arranger), Bill Doggett, Ray Tunia, Harold Francis and Fletcher Smith. Some singers have tenuous ties to Deek Watson&#x27;s or Charlie Fuqua&#x27;s offshoot groups; many, with no credentials whatsoever, claim to be original members.

==The Ink Spots in popular culture==
===Television appearances===
The Ink Spots are television pioneers when, on November 6, 1936 they were the first musical group to perform live on television, during an NBC test broadcast held at the NBC/RCA Building for the press. In 1948, they were the first black performers to appear on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. The Ink Spots made guest appearances on Milton Berle&#x27;s &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; on three separate occasions in 1949, on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; three times (1948, 1950, and 1952), on Steve Allen&#x27;s &quot;Songs For Sale&quot; twice in 1952, and on &quot;Star of the Family&quot; once in 1952.

===Music videos and live footage===
In 1946, a short documentary about nightlife in New York City called &quot;March of Time&quot; featured a clip of the Ink Spots singing &quot;I&#x27;d Climb The Highest Mountain&quot; live at the Cafe Zanzibar; the clip and outtakes can be found for viewing on various websites. In 1947, cameras captured segments of the Ink Spots in live performance at the Daily Express Film Ball in London England; this footage can be obtained by British Pathe.

In 1951, Snader Telescriptions produced five &quot;soundies&quot; (also known as music videos) of the Ink Spots. These clips feature the group lip-syncing to the songs &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Care&quot;, &quot;You May Be the Sweetheart of Somebody Else&quot;, &quot;The Gypsy&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Heading Back to Paradise&quot;, and &quot;It Is No Secret&quot;. Bill Kenny&#x27;s wife Audrey portrays &quot;the gypsy&quot; in the video for &quot;The Gypsy&quot; and can also be seen serving food to the Ink Spots in &quot;You May Be the Sweetheart of Somebody Else&quot;. Billy Bowen&#x27;s wife Ruth Bowen is seen walking through the set carrying a dog (Bill Kenny&#x27;s actual pet) and serving drinks in &quot;You May Be the Sweetheart of Somebody Else&quot;.

===Ink Spots music used in television and film===
The Ink Spots&#x27; music has been used in the films &quot;Get Low&quot;, &quot;Radio Days&quot;, &quot;Raging Bull&quot;, &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot;, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, &quot;The Aviator&quot;, &quot;Iris&quot;, &quot;Sphere&quot;, &quot;Tree&#x27;s Lounge&quot;, &quot;Malcolm X&quot;, &quot;Maria&#x27;s Lovers&quot;, &quot;How to Make an American Quilt&quot;, &quot;Men Don&#x27;t Leave&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot;, &quot;Spontaneous Combustion&quot;, &quot;Carmen Miranda: Bananas is My Business&quot;, &quot;Australia&quot;, &quot;Mr. Nobody&quot;, &quot;Hyde Park on Hudson&quot;, &quot;The Rover&quot;, &quot;Twenty Bucks&quot;, &quot;Manchester by the Sea&quot;, &quot;Logorama&quot;, and &quot;Forbidden Love: The Unashamed Stories of Lesbian Lives&quot;.

===The Ink Spots in video games===
Recordings by the Ink Spots have been featured in the popular &quot;Fallout&quot; video game franchise. Their recording of &quot;Maybe&quot; was used as the opening theme of &quot;Fallout&quot; (1997), as well as in the epilogue. It was also played on the in-game radio station Galaxy News Radio in &quot;Fallout 3&quot; (2008), alongside their recordings of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Set the World on Fire&quot; and &quot;Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall&quot;. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Set the World on Fire&quot; also features in both the game&#x27;s trailer and its opening cinematic. The song &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin to Tell a Lie&quot; (Bill Kenny&#x27;s solo, not original recording from 1941) is played on the in-game radio station Radio New Vegas in the 2010 video game &quot;&quot;. In 2015, the group was once again featured in the &quot;Fallout&quot; franchise, when their recording of the Russ Morgan and Seger Ellis ballad &quot;It&#x27;s All Over but the Crying&quot; was used in the trailer for &quot;Fallout 4&quot;; that song is also played on the in-game radio station Diamond City Radio, alongside &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Set the World on Fire&quot;, &quot;Maybe&quot;, and &quot;Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall&quot;. The former two songs appear once more in &quot;Fallout 76&quot;, alongside &quot;We Three (My Echo, My Shadow and Me)&quot;.

&quot;BioShock&quot; and &quot;BioShock 2&quot; have also made use of the group&#x27;s recordings: &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Care&quot; and &quot;The Best Things in Life Are Free&quot; in the former, and &quot;We Three (My Echo, My Shadow and Me)&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Making Believe&quot;, and &quot;Memories of You&quot; in the latter. Still others were included in &quot;Mafia II&quot; and on the in-game radio stations in &quot;L.A. Noire&quot;.

===Miscellaneous===
*The song &quot;Jukebox Saturday Night&quot;, made famous by the Glenn Miller Orchestra, references the Ink Spots, imitating the iconic Ink Spots guitar intro and the group&#x27;s style of singing during much of the second half of the recording.
*Spike Jones&#x27;s 1945 version of &quot;You Always Hurt The One You Love&quot; featured vocalists Carl Grayson and Red Ingle imitating the Ink Spots&#x27; &#x27;top and bottom&#x27; vocal gimmick during the first half of the recording.
*The Ink Spots appeared as a guest quartet on the April 4, 1948, episode of &quot;The Jack Benny Program,&quot; singing a version of &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Care&quot; as the advertisement for Lucky Strike cigarettes.

*In 1960, The Quarry Men (composed of Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, and Stuart Sutcliffe, later to form The Beatles) recorded &quot;You&#x27;ll Be Mine&quot;, an Ink Spots parody.
*Ian Fleming mentioned the group twice in his 1962 James Bond novel &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, when the leading female, Vivienne Michel, recalls a love affair from her past. She recalls hearing &quot;Someone&#x27;s Rocking My Dreamboat&quot;, and mistakenly credits the group with singing &quot;Only a Paper Doll to Call My Own&quot; (an apparent reference to The Mills Brothers&#x27; song &quot;Paper Doll&quot;). Bond himself overhears the group singing &quot;Java Jive&quot; aboard the &quot;US Manta&quot; submarine in &quot;Thunderball&quot;.
*The Ink Spots were mentioned in several episodes of the 1970s NBC sitcom &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, as one of Fred Sanford&#x27;s favorite groups, with series star Redd Foxx crooning their song, &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Care&quot;. Reportedly, Foxx had royalties for singing their music taken out of his salary out of love for the group and because NBC would not pay for the rights.
*In the 1980s, a commercial for Chanel No. 5 included a version of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Set the World on Fire&quot; sung solo by Bill Kenny, the former lead tenor of the group, with an unknown studio vocal group for a 1977 CBS Records LP entitled &quot;The Ink Spots – If I Didn&#x27;t Care&quot;. The recording was used in the ad without permission from Kenny&#x27;s executrix and widow Audrey Kenny. In 1982, Mrs. Kenny took legal action and, according to Bill Kenny&#x27;s former pianist Bev Gore-Langton, was successful. The commercial depicted the Transamerica Pyramid building in San Francisco with the shadow of a plane flying overhead.
*In the 1980s, &quot;Java Jive&quot; was used in commercials for Sanka coffee, prominently featuring the likes of Lena Horne and Gregory Hines.
*&quot;Someone&#x27;s Rocking my Dreamboat&quot; was sung by Bugs Bunny in the Looney Tunes short &quot;The Big Snooze&quot;.
*The original 1982 theatrical trailer for the movie &quot;Blade Runner&quot; prominently featured a short clip of &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Care&quot;, and the song is used in the early &quot;workprint&quot; version of the film, but it was replaced in the theatrical and all subsequent releases with &quot;One More Kiss, Dear&quot;, an original composition in a similar vocal and melodic style.
*Heavy metal group Megadeth used a 1955 recording of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want To Set The World On Fire&quot; recorded by a later &quot;imposter&quot; Ink Spots group on their 1988 album &quot;So Far, So Good... So What!&quot; as an introduction to the song &quot;Set the World Afire&quot;.
*The Ink Spots were the subject of a 1998 book by Marv Goldberg, &quot;More Than Words Can Say: The Ink Spots and Their Music&quot;.
*Several of the Ink Spots&#x27; original recordings are used in the off-Broadway production &quot;Sleep No More&quot;, which first opened in 2011.
*The recording &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Set the World on Fire&quot; has been featured in multiple television shows and short films, being played at the end of the 2009 short film &quot;Logorama&quot;, as well as at the end of a special seasonal episode, &quot;Treehouse of Horror XVII&quot;, on &quot;The Simpsons.&quot;
* The Ink Spots&#x27; version of &quot;I&#x27;m Beginning to See the Light&quot; with Ella Fitzgerald is featured in the 2016 film &quot;Manchester by the Sea&quot;.
* The Ink Spots&#x27; song &quot;Address Unknown&quot; plays during the opening of the first episode of &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;. Additionally, the group&#x27;s rendition of &quot;We Three (My Echo, My Shadow and Me)&quot; plays over the opening scene of the episode &quot;Smoke&quot;.
* The Ink Spots songs feature throughout Fallout Season 1; &quot;We Three (My Echo, My Shadow and Me)&quot; closes episode 8.
* The Ink Spots are the subject in one of the comic letters that form the Going’ Places chapter in the book Letters From A Nut by Ted L. Nancy. In that letter, the author asks information for “The Ink Spots Day” fictional festival that, according to L. Nancy, will be take place in West Hollywood. The mayor of West Hollywood answers the petition saying that event won’t be in his city but: “The Ink Spots” are a favorite of mine.”

<doc id="166084" wikidata="Q8067817" url="?curid=166084" title="Compressibility">
<text>In thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, the compressibility (also known as the coefficient of compressibility or, if the temperature is held constant, the isothermal compressibility) is a measure of the instantaneous relative volume change of a fluid or solid as a response to a pressure (or mean stress) change. In its simple form, the compressibility formula_1 (denoted in some fields) may be expressed as

:formula_2,

where is volume and is pressure. The choice to define compressibility as the negative of the fraction makes compressibility positive in the (usual) case that an increase in pressure induces a reduction in volume. The reciprocal of compressibility at fixed temperature is called the isothermal bulk modulus.

==Definition==
The specification above is incomplete, because for any object or system the magnitude of the compressibility depends strongly on whether the process is isentropic or isothermal. Accordingly, isothermal compressibility is defined:

:formula_3
where the subscript indicates that the partial differential is to be taken at constant temperature.

Isentropic compressibility is defined:

:formula_4

where is entropy. For a solid, the distinction between the two is usually negligible.

Since the density of a material is inversely proportional to its volume, it can be shown that in both cases
:formula_5
For instance, for an ideal gas, 
:formula_6. Hence formula_7. 
Consequently, the isothermal
compressibility of an ideal gas is 
:formula_8.
The ideal gas (where the particles do not interact with each other) is an abstraction. The particles in real materials interact with each other. Then, the relation between the pressure, density and temperature is known as the equation of state denoted by some function formula_9. The Van der Waals equation is an example of an equation of state for a realistic gas.
:formula_10.
Knowing the equation of state, the compressibility can be determined for any substance.

===Relation to speed of sound===

The speed of sound is defined in classical mechanics as:

:formula_11

It follows, by replacing partial derivatives, that the isentropic compressibility can be expressed as:

:formula_12

===Relation to bulk modulus===

The inverse of the compressibility is called the bulk modulus, often denoted (sometimes or formula_13).).
The compressibility equation relates the isothermal compressibility (and indirectly the pressure) to the structure of the liquid.

==Thermodynamics==
The isothermal compressibility is generally related to the isentropic (or adiabatic) compressibility by a few relations:

: formula_14
: formula_15
: formula_16

where is the heat capacity ratio, is the volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion, is the particle density, and formula_17 is the thermal pressure coefficient.

In an extensive thermodynamic system, the application of statistical mechanics shows that the isothermal compressibility is also related to the relative size of fluctuations in particle density:
: formula_18
where is the chemical potential.

The term &quot;compressibility&quot; is also used in thermodynamics to describe deviations of the thermodynamic properties of a real gas from those expected from an ideal gas.

The compressibility factor is defined as

: formula_19
where is the pressure of the gas, is its temperature, and formula_20 is its molar volume, all measured independently of one another. In the case of an ideal gas, the compressibility factor is equal to unity, and the familiar ideal gas law is recovered:

: formula_21

 can, in general, be either greater or less than unity for a real gas.

The deviation from ideal gas behavior tends to become particularly significant (or, equivalently, the compressibility factor strays far from unity) near the critical point, or in the case of high pressure or low temperature. In these cases, a generalized compressibility chart or an alternative equation of state better suited to the problem must be utilized to produce accurate results.

==Earth science==

The Earth sciences use &quot;compressibility&quot; to quantify the ability of a soil or rock to reduce in volume under applied pressure. This concept is important for specific storage, when estimating groundwater reserves in confined aquifers. Geologic materials are made up of two portions: solids and voids (or same as porosity). The void space can be full of liquid or gas. Geologic materials reduce in volume only when the void spaces are reduced, which expel the liquid or gas from the voids. This can happen over a period of time, resulting in settlement.

It is an important concept in geotechnical engineering in the design of certain structural foundations. For example, the construction of high-rise structures over underlying layers of highly compressible bay mud poses a considerable design constraint, and often leads to use of driven piles or other innovative techniques.

==Fluid dynamics==
The degree of compressibility of a fluid has strong implications for its dynamics. Most notably, the propagation of sound is dependent on the compressibility of the medium.

==Aerodynamics==

Compressibility is an important factor in aerodynamics. At low speeds, the compressibility of air is not significant in relation to aircraft design, but as the airflow nears and exceeds the speed of sound, a host of new aerodynamic effects become important in the design of aircraft. These effects, often several of them at a time, made it very difficult for World War II era aircraft to reach speeds much beyond .

Many effects are often mentioned in conjunction with the term &quot;compressibility&quot;, but regularly have little to do with the compressible nature of air. From a strictly aerodynamic point of view, the term should refer only to those side-effects arising as a result of the changes in airflow from an incompressible fluid (similar in effect to water) to a compressible fluid (acting as a gas) as the speed of sound is approached. There are two effects in particular, wave drag and critical mach.
One complication occurs in hypersonic aerodynamics, where dissociation causes an increase in the &quot;notional&quot; molar volume because a mole of oxygen, as O2, becomes 2 moles of monatomic oxygen and N2 similarly dissociates to 2 N. Since this occurs dynamically as air flows over the aerospace object, it is convenient to alter the compressibility factor , defined for an initial 30 gram moles of air, rather than track the varying mean molecular weight, millisecond by millisecond. This pressure dependent transition occurs for atmospheric oxygen in the 2,500–4,000 K temperature range, and in the 5,000–10,000 K range for nitrogen.

In transition regions, where this pressure dependent dissociation is incomplete, both beta (the volume/pressure differential ratio) and the differential, constant pressure heat capacity greatly increases. For moderate pressures, above 10,000 K the gas further dissociates into free electrons and ions. for the resulting plasma can similarly be computed for a mole of initial air, producing values between 2 and 4 for partially or singly ionized gas. Each dissociation absorbs a great deal of energy in a reversible process and this greatly reduces the thermodynamic temperature of hypersonic gas decelerated near the aerospace object. Ions or free radicals transported to the object surface by diffusion may release this extra (nonthermal) energy if the surface catalyzes the slower recombination process.

==Negative compressibility==
For ordinary materials, the bulk compressibility (sum of the linear compressibilities on the three axes) is positive, that is, an increase in pressure squeezes the material to a smaller volume. This condition is required for mechanical stability. However, under very specific conditions, materials can exhibit a compressibility that can be negative.

<text>Gisborough Priory is a ruined Augustinian priory in Guisborough in the borough of Redcar and Cleveland, North Yorkshire, England. It was founded in 1119 as the Priory of St Mary by the Norman feudal magnate Robert de Brus, also an ancestor of the Scottish king, Robert the Bruce. It became one of the richest monastic foundations in England with grants from the crown and bequests from de Brus, other nobles and gentry and local people of more modest means. Much of the Romanesque Norman priory was destroyed in a fire in 1289. It was rebuilt in the Gothic style on a grander scale over the following century. Its remains are regarded as among the finest surviving examples of early Gothic architecture in England.

The priory prospered until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540, when it was abolished along with England&#x27;s other monastic communities. The priory buildings were demolished and the stone re-used in other buildings in Guisborough. The east end of the priory church was left standing with its great window forming a distinctive arch, a well-known landmark used as a symbol for Guisborough. It became part of the estate of the Chaloner family, who acquired it in 1550. The east window was preserved by them as part of a Romantic vista adjoining their seat, Gisborough Hall, from which the priory takes its idiosyncratically spelled name. It is owned by the Chaloners but is in the care of English Heritage as a scheduled monument.

Since the 19th century archaeological excavations have taken place in the priory grounds, though a substantial part of the site has not yet been investigated. In addition to the east window, surviving visible fragments of the complex include the lower courses of the west range, a vaulted undercroft, a gateway and a 14th-century dovecote still in use today. The adjoining Priory Gardens, laid out by the Chaloners in the 18th century, are under restoration by a volunteer group. The priory ruins and gardens are open to the public throughout the year.

==History==

===Establishment===

Guisborough was well-established at the time of the priory&#x27;s founding; the town&#x27;s name refers to the fortified place of a Scandinavian called Gigr, who may have taken over a site established by the Anglo-Saxons or Romans who lived in the vicinity before the arrival of Vikings in the 8th and 9th centuries. A priest, church and mill were recorded in 1086 in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; which refers to the town as &quot;Ghigesburg&quot;. Following the Norman Conquest, William the Conqueror gave lands in the area to the Count of Mortain. He passed them to his friend Robert de Brus, Lord of Skelton, one of the largest landowners in the north, owning more than in Yorkshire alone. William&#x27;s Harrying of the North left the region in a severely depressed and depopulated state. There were few monasteries north of the River Humber and opportunities existed for new agricultural and religious developments. The Augustinian order came to England at the start of the 12th century and established houses in England, including major ones at Bridlington, Nostell and Kirkham. They were communities of canons living under the rule of St. Augustine, wearing dark robes that earned them the name the &quot;Black Canons&quot;.

According to the priory&#x27;s founding charter, Robert de Brus &quot;founded a certain Monastery of a religious order in Gysburne , to the honour of God, and the holy Virgin Mary&quot;. He gave &quot;to the same Church and the service of God in it, all Gysburne, with all things pertaining thereto it&quot;. The gift included lands amounting to twenty carucates and two oxgangs (roughly equivalent to about ), churches, mills and other possessions, and grants from others. The charter started that the endowment was to provide &quot;material for ever for their buildings, and all other necessities of their house&quot;. The foundation was authorised by Pope Calixtus II and Thurstan, Archbishop of York. De Brus may have been emulating his peers in Yorkshire, who had founded monastic institutions for their religious obligations. The date of the foundation is unclear. The 14th-century canon and historian Walter of Guisborough gives it as 1129, but a charter of confirmation from Pope Calixtus dates to the period of his pontificate between 1119–24. The priory may have had two foundation charters, a shorter one dating possibly to 1119 and a detailed one dating to 1129 that may have been the definitive document. Robert de Brus appointed his younger brother, William de Brus, to be the first Prior of Gisborough and the Brus family continued to be the primary patrons of the priory and have a strong influence there.
The rights and privileges of the prior and canons grew over the centuries added to by royal grants. Henry III granted the rights of soc and sac, thol and theam and infangtheof. He established a Monday market at Guisborough and the right to hold an annual three-day fair to mark the feast of the Assumption (15 August). The proceeds and fees from these events supported the priory. The prior and canons were granted free warren in the lands around Guisborough and several nearby villages which was extended to more demesnes by Edward III, who permitted them to convert of land into a deer park (now Park Wood). Henry IV gave them the twice-yearly right of frankpledge, the right of waif and stray and the return of briefs and writs which gave the priory a steady income from rents, fines, licences and other fees. The canons of Guisborough owned 4,000 sheep, mostly in Eskdale, in the 13th and 14th century.

The priory became known for its strict observance of the Augustinian rule and religious precepts. Its reputation for &quot;ducentes canonicam vitam&quot; (&quot;living a canonical life&quot;) attracted Saint Malachy from Ireland who, as Saint Bernard of Clairvaux had a long and close involvement with Gisborough. The canons were closely associated with the Cistercians who, like the Augustianians, had a reformist outlook. One Gisborough canon, William of Newminster, moved to the Cistercian Fountains Abbey to become its abbot. The priory was supported by the local people and records survive of numerous small grants, related to the almonry (the place or chamber where alms were distributed to the poor) and to support building work. The canons leased, bought and sold land and loaned money using property grants as collateral to benefit the priory&#x27;s building fund. As the priory became more wealthy, discipline among its canons slipped and the Archbishops of York found it necessary to take corrective action in the late 13th century. A number of canons were sent to Kirkham and Bridlington for correction and Gisborough in turn took in disobedient canons from other places. The priory also became embroiled in a dispute with a local landowner, Robert de Thweng, who raided its properties and tithe barns in 1232 under the alias of &quot;Will Wither&quot;, in the course of a dispute with the priory over the advowson of Kirkleatham parish church.

On 16 May 1289, the priory suffered a catastrophic fire. According to an account by Walter of Guisborough, a plumber soldering the lead roof forgot to put out his fire, causing the roof timbers to catch fire and molten lead ran down into the church below. Much of the building was destroyed and many effects, costly books, chalices and vestments were lost. The canons sought to raise funds for rebuilding. They petitioned the king to grant them the advowsons of the parish churches of Barnham, Easington and Heslerton, and in 1309 and 1311 the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of Durham rewarded the priory&#x27;s donors with indulgences granting remission of temporal punishment for sins. Most of the nave and chancel was rebuilt with the support of the de Brus family, whose coat of arms was displayed on its buildings.

Rebuilding probably took around a century to complete. Work was slowed by high costs and civil unrest in the early 14th century, when Scottish raiders repeatedly plundered the north of England. The priory&#x27;s lands were reduced in value by the raids, diminishing its income. Its wealth was tapped by Archbishop Melton of York to make good his own losses in 1319, and in 1320 it had to take in refugees from monastic houses that had been forced to disperse to escape the raiders. Probably as a consequence of the troubles, in 1328 the priory petitioned the king to be exempted from the &quot;clerical tenth&quot; (a 10% tax on clerical property) and in 1344 it was granted permission to fortify its buildings. By 1380 its staff had diminished to 26 canons and two lay brothers.

The Yorkshire line of the de Brus family died out with the death of the childless Peter IV de Brus in 1272 but the priory was still patronised by the local nobility. The Fauconberg and Thweng families, who married Peter&#x27;s sisters Agnes and Lucia, took over the patronage which continued for several centuries. Many prominent local nobles were buried there, as was the Scottish Robert V de Brus, grandfather of King Robert the Bruce. At least nine patrons and their families were buried in the priory between 1295 and 1411. The priory received substantial financial support from its patrons; in 1381 William, Lord Latimer provided funds to complete the north nave and donated £333 6s 8d (roughly equivalent to £1.6 million today) for a new belfry. He left the priory cattle from his manor at Ugthorpe, bequeathed a range of religious items, and made arrangements for his body to be interred there on his death.

===Dissolution and after===

In 1533 Henry VIII of England was excommunicated for divorcing Catherine of Aragon. The Act of Supremacy passed in 1534 declared Henry Supreme Head of the Church of England and the church&#x27;s estate in England became part of the king&#x27;s estate. In 1535 Henry ordered a comprehensive survey of the church&#x27;s property, the &quot;Valor Ecclesiasticus&quot;. It found that Gisborough Priory had an annual net value of £628.6s.8d., which made it the fourth wealthiest monastic house in Yorkshire. In 1536 monasteries with less than £200 of annual income were suppressed, exempting the priory from the first wave of suppression.

A second survey carried out by the king&#x27;s commissioners, Thomas Legh and Richard Leyton, provided for the final suppression on charges of a lack of quality of religious life. Prior James Cockerell of Guisborough was forced to resign and was replaced by Robert Pursglove, who was loyal to the king. The priory&#x27;s dissolution was not welcomed by locals, who derived economic benefit from its presence – in 1536, around 500 families depended on it for their livelihood. The strength of feeling was recorded in a letter from Lord Conyers and Sir John Bulmer to Thomas Cromwell: &quot;On Sunday, 11th  July [1539], at Gysburn in Yorkshire, when the parish priest was declaring the articles [of dissolution] directed by the King to the Archbishop of York, one John Atkeynson &quot;alias&quot; Brotton came violently and took book forth of the priest&#x27;s hands, and pulled it in pieces.&quot; Popular discontent sparked the Pilgrimage of Grace, in which Prior Cockerell was implicated. When the revolt failed, he was hanged at Tyburn in London with the Prior of Bridlington, the Abbot of Jervaulx and the former Abbot of Fountains.

The priory was formally dissolved on 8 April 1540 and surrendered to the king&#x27;s men on 22 December 1540, making it one of the last monastic houses in England to be suppressed. A proposal to found a secular college there came to nothing and the priory buildings – with the exception of the gatehouses and the great east window – were demolished. On 21 November 1541 Thomas Legh was granted a lease &quot;of the buildings with the site and precincts of the Priory to be then demolished and carried away.&quot; Demolition was carried out by collapsing its central tower into the body of the church, crushing it in its fall and reducing it to rubble.

The site and lands were re-let in 1550 to Sir Thomas Chaloner, who later purchased the property outright. The Chaloners occupied the former priors&#x27; quarters in the west range before moving to their new mansion, Old Gisborough Hall, on Bow Street in the late-17th century. The priory remains were cleared and the fallen stonework looted or sold. The grounds were redeveloped as formal gardens within the grounds of Old Gisborough Hall. John Walker Ord, a local historian in the mid-19th century, described how the priory&#x27;s stonework could be seen in many buildings around Guisborough. He deplored the profane uses to which it had been put:

Some fragments of the priory travelled further afield. At Hardwick Hall near Sedgefield, a mock ruin was built incorporating sculptured stones brought from the priory. The priory&#x27;s wealth became the stuff of local legends, one of which claimed an underground passage led from the priory to a cave under the hills in which a raven stood guard over a chest of gold.

The priory&#x27;s lands around Guisborough were a source of wealth for the Chaloners. Around 1595, Sir Thomas Chaloner&#x27;s son, also called Thomas, established England&#x27;s first alum works at Belman Bank south of the town. Alum was an important product with a variety of industrial uses. It was especially important to the cloth industry as a mordant (a substance used to fix dyes on cloth). The supply of alum was controlled by a cartel controlled by the Papal States and Spain which were in conflict with England and exercised a virtual monopoly on the provision of alum to Christian Europe, as the import of cheaper Turkish alum was banned by Pope Paul II in the mid-15th century. Chaloner visited the Pope&#x27;s alum works at Tolfa near Rome and noticed the soil and vegetation around them resembled those of his estate at Guisborough. On his return he established alum works at Belman Bank with the aid of workmen smuggled from Rome, earning him a papal excommunication. John Walker Ord casts doubt on the story, noting an account published a few decades afterwards stated that the workmen came from France and does not mention Chaloner&#x27;s travels in Italy.
The only substantial part of the priory to survive was the eastern gable of the presbytery with its great east window. Its survival owed much to the rise of Romanticism in the 18th century. The portrayal of ruined buildings in idealised landscapes by and his contemporaries inspired a fashion for the nobility and gentry to produce paintings of monasteries providing an incentive for landowners to preserve them as romantic ruins, rather than using them as quarries. Gisborough Priory&#x27;s east window was one of the first examples of a monastic ruin to be retained for its visual qualities. It was incorporated into the grounds of Old Gisborough Hall as a romantic ruin and the sill of the great window removed to ensure an uninterrupted view. Fittingly, given his role in inspiring the east window&#x27;s preservation, Turner himself sketched it in 1801 during a visit to Yorkshire.

East Lawn was laid out in front of the east window and was used for grand bazaars and fêtes until the early 20th century. A ha-ha was installed behind to keep cattle out of the grounds. To the south of the priory buildings the Long Terrace ran almost the full length of the grounds. It afforded access to the ruins via a flight of steps flanked by two carved demi-sea wolves, reflecting the coat of arms of the Chaloners. They were thought to be dragons by local people and the steps were referred to as the Dragon Steps.

Old Gisborough Hall was demolished around 1825 and the Chaloners built a mansion house, Gisborough Hall, about half a mile to the east in 1857. In 1932, Thomas Chaloner, 2nd Baron Gisborough transferred control of the priory to the Office of Works. which became the responsibility of the Ministry of Works, then the Department of the Environment and from 1984, English Heritage. It remains the property of Lord Gisborough; English Heritage is responsible for maintaining the ruins, while day-to-day running is managed by Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council.

According to folklore, the priory is haunted by the ghost of a monk in a black habit who returns annually to check that its buried treasure has not been disturbed. He is said to arrive at midnight on the year&#x27;s first new moon to lower a ghostly drawbridge spanning a vanished moat. In 1966 and 1967 a hundred people turned out to watch and allegedly managed to spot a cowled figure, but in 1968 the few spectators who turned up saw nothing.

==Description of the priory buildings==

Gisborough Priory is characterised by a few highly visible remains. The priory church survives in a fragmentary state, dominated by the east wall of the presbytery that stands to its full height. Several of the priory church&#x27;s column bases can also be seen, as can a number of excavated graves within the presbytery. Elsewhere on the site, the outline of the cloister is visible but is largely unexcavated, while the ruins of the west (or cellarer&#x27;s) range constitutes the largest area of other remains above ground. A ruined gatehouse and a still-intact dovecote (the latter off-limits to visitors) stand on the western edges of the site.

===Priory church===

The remains of the priory church are dominated by the eastern gable wall of the presbytery that still stands to its full height. Its great east window is regarded as one of the finest examples of late-13th-century church architecture. The design is so close to that of the eastern arm of Ripon Cathedral, which was built around the same time, that it is thought to have been modelled on Ripon&#x27;s design. The window&#x27;s tracery has disappeared, as has its sill, but from the stubs and surviving fragments it can be deduced that it had seven major lights (the glazed openings in the window). At its centre was a great circle of tracery filled with trefoiled lights. The main gable of the east wall is flanked by massive buttresses capped with gables and octagonal pinnacles. A similar pair of pinnacles top the main gable, flanking a window of unusual design; a bracket projects from the lower lobe to support a statue (no longer present), possibly of the Virgin Mary, to whom the priory was dedicated.

Little remains above ground of the rest of the priory, but much can be deduced from the surviving stonework. In its final form the priory church had a nave of eight bays and a quire and presbytery of nine bays, with a total length of . The survival of the east wall allows us to deduce that the ridge line of the roof stood above ground. The presbytery&#x27;s arcades were supported by eight clustered shafts, the bases of which are still visible, with capitals carved with naturalistic foliage. The clerestory and triforium were combined into a single arch with the main arcade below. The presbytery&#x27;s high vault was executed in stone with bosses decorated in red and white paint and gold leaf, traces of which were still visible when several of the bosses were found in the 19th century. The eastern bay of the presbytery was divided into several chapels and the remnants of parclose screens are visible on the main aisle&#x27;s north and south responds. The main altar would have stood a short distance to the west, behind a tall screen.

At the angle of each aisle, a spiral staircase – still visible on each side of the surviving east wall – gave access to a passage inside the walls and to secondary stairs within the angles of the main gable enabling access to all parts of the building for maintenance and cleaning without requiring scaffolding. Nothing remains of the north or south transepts, which extended on the north side beyond the present boundary wall into the graveyard of St Nicholas&#x27;s Church.

Several burials (presumably of high-ranking benefactors and clergy) were made within the priory and 19th-century archaeologists found stone coffins during excavations. They are visible against the east wall, but their original location was not recorded. Two centrally placed grave slabs are visible below the east window. The priory once housed the Brus cenotaph, a memorial to its founders erected in 1521. It was removed in 1540 and dismantled. Most of its parts were recovered and reassembled in the 19th century, and the reconstructed cenotaph is displayed in Saint Nicholas&#x27; Church next to the ruins.

The priory church housed a shrine to the Virgin Mary which one of the most significant Marian shrines in the north, along with others at Walsingham, Lincoln, Scarborough, Jesmond and Carlisle. Although it was destroyed during the Reformation along with the priory, it was revived in 1949 by Father Arthur Mercer, Guisborough&#x27;s first Roman Catholic parish priest for 400 years, and is housed in the town&#x27;s St Paulinus Church.

Fragments of other buildings associated with the priory can be seen on the site. There was a cloister measuring square to the south of the priory church surrounded by domestic buildings or ranges. They replaced an earlier cloister and ranges destroyed in the fire of 1289 rebuilt to a new, larger, design. Processional doors on the cloister&#x27;s north wall gave access to the nave of the church. In 1854, surviving arches and columns from the cloister were taken to London for display in the Crystal Palace where they provided the basis for a reconstruction of a medieval cloister in the &quot;English National Art Court&quot; section of the exhibition.

Fragments of the west range – the cellarer&#x27;s range – are extant. It was entered from the west by an outer parlour, projecting from the north end of the range, where members of the community received visitors. The prior lived on the upper floor which comprised a hall, chamber and chapel dedicated to Saint Hilda. The prior&#x27;s rooms were probably located above the outer parlour, as was the pattern at other monasteries, accessing the cloister and the outside world. The largest surviving fragment of the range comprises a &quot;cellarium&quot; or storehouse where supplies were kept. It is a vaulted undercroft of nine bays constructed from stone ashlar with its floor level below that of the cloister. It is relatively well-preserved and believed to have been divided by timber partitions which were later replaced in stone.

Most of the refectory (dining hall) range to the south of the cloister and the dorter range to the east, which contained the chapter house and dormitory, have yet to be excavated. Only the western end of the refectory range has been excavated; it presents a vaulted undercroft, three bays of which survive, above which the refectory was located on the first floor. A service passage survives between the kitchen and the refectory. The western part of the undercroft was used as a buttery in the late Middle Ages but would have had severely restricted headroom due to its raised floor.

===Outer buildings===

The priory buildings stood at the centre of a walled precinct arranged in two courts, inner and outer with gatehouses at the entrances to both; the remains of the great gate of the inner court are extant but the outer gatehouse no longer survives. The gate comprised an outer porch, an inner gatehall and a porter&#x27;s lodge on the ground floor with chambers above the arch. It survived intact into the early 18th century but only the outer porch remains. The structure consists of a single large round-headed archway on the outer side with two smaller arches of different sizes, both deeply rebated to accommodate doors, a few metres to the south. The larger arch was for wagons while pedestrians entered through the smaller arch. Little remains of the gatehall or the porter&#x27;s lodge; the only remnants visible are the stub of its north wall and a latrine shaft.

The canons built an octagonal dovecote a short distance to the west of the west range. The dovecote is extant, though it cannot be visited and is not part of the priory grounds. Built in the 14th century, it was modified in the mid-18th century with the addition of a pyramidal roof tiled with Welsh slate and capped with an open-sided timber cupola. The original nesting boxes have been removed and the dovecote is used as a garden store.

===Older buildings on the site===

Gisborough Priory was rebuilt three times; the ruins visible today are principally those of the third rebuild. The site was occupied in Anglo-Saxon times by at least one structure, possibly a timber-framed church or boundary wall, indicated by a number of postholes. It is believed there was a Saxon settlement in the vicinity as late-Saxon potsherds and an 8th-century coin have been found buried under the remains of the priory&#x27;s west nave. The site was abandoned at some point and by the time the priory was built the land on which it stood was mostly under cultivation. Part of it was used as a graveyard in the early 12th century and an early Norman building was erected in the vicinity, possibly a temporary church.

The Norman priory, completed around 1180, was relatively short and narrow. It was constructed in the Romanesque style with twin aisles either side of the nave and a single tower at the west end, aligned with the main axis of the church. It could be entered from the north, via an external door, and the south via the cloister. The existence of the northward door suggests it was used by a secular congregation, possibly the local nobility and patrons. A number of graves associated with the first priory have been found in the south aisle&#x27;s floor and against the north wall.

The priory was rebuilt around 1200 on a larger scale with the Romanesque church demolished to its first course of ashlar. The construction of the new church continued through much of the 13th century. The enlarged priory had twin towers at the west end flanking a large double doorway above which was a central rose window; piped water was provided using lead pipes from the cloister, under the church to buildings or standpipes to the north or west of the priory. The main body of the church comprised a nave with two aisles, transepts and a choir. The aisles were laid with geometric coloured tiles adjoining the sandstone columns of the nave. The north aisle was divided into alcoves or private chapels where a number of people – probably local nobles and gentry – were buried. An unusual feature of the church was a well, sunk into the nave, possibly built in an effort to safeguard its water supplies.

The effects of the fire that destroyed the priory in 1289 can be seen in scorched paving between the surviving pillars. It was thought the church had been completely rebuilt, but excavations in the 1980s show that a substantial amount of the less damaged west end was reused which resulted in a distinct inconsistency between the two ends, which were constructed in different architectural styles. Rebuilding was a major task that took several generations and was probably not completed until the end of the 14th century. It is unclear how much of the second priory survived the fire. Where the priory was rebuilt, its builders reused as much as possible; the core of the surviving eastern gable wall is full of fragments from the destroyed second priory.

===Priory Gardens and Monks&#x27; Pond===

Land immediately south of the priory was used by the Chaloners for formal gardens attached to Old Gisborough Hall. In the early 18th century they planted an oval-shaped double avenue of trees, the Monks&#x27; Walk, where stonework recovered from mid-19th century excavations was deposited. In between the trees was a manicured lawn used to hold musical and theatrical productions. The Monks&#x27; Walk fell into disuse and became overgrown, but it was restored by the Gisborough Priory Project between 2007 and 2009.

In the late 19th century, Margaret Chaloner, wife of the first Lord Gisborough, laid out formal gardens of a typical late-Victorian and Edwardian design with elaborate bedding schemes and gravelled paths. There was a rose garden and a sunken Italian garden with an ornamental pool at its centre. They were open to the public for a small fee and could be entered through a gateway on Bow Street. The gardens are now freely accessible.

Further east, off the Whitby Road, is the Monks&#x27; Pond, the canons&#x27; fish pond. It presents a dramatic vista in which the priory arch is reflected and has often been photographed and painted. In 1908, the pond was the scene of an elaborate water tableau organised by Lady Gisborough to raise funds for the restoration of St Nicholas&#x27; Church. The pond was home to a number of exceptionally large fish, but pollution in 2000 caused by a sewage leak led to the death of more than 5,000 fish.

===Other properties owned by the priory===

The priory was responsible for St Leonard&#x27;s leper hospital at Hutton Lowcross to the south-west of Guisborough. The hospital was probably founded in the 12th century and became a dependency of the priory in 1275. It was last documented in 1339. Its fate is unclear but it probably survived until the Dissolution in 1540. Archaeological excavations in a field near Hutton Village in the 1960s did not find definite evidence of the leper hospital.

The priory may also have owned a cell at Scarth Wood at Whorlton. A grant issued by Stephen de Meynell in the reign of Henry I records the donation of the hamlet of Scarth to enable the priory to establish a cell for habitation by a single monk or canon. It is unclear whether the cell was built as Scarth is not mentioned in the priory&#x27;s deeds or in Henry VIII&#x27;s commissioners&#x27; valuation of its property. Fragmentary building remains at Scarth are recorded as existing in the mid-18th century. They were cleared by the start of the 19th century so there is no trace of whatever might once have stood there or indication of what it might have been used for.

==Excavations==

In 1865–1867 Captain Thomas Chaloner and William Downing Bruce carried out the first major excavation by cutting a trench across the site. A number of features were discovered, including a stone coffin containing the skeleton of a tall man thought to be Robert de Brus, the remnants of a monumental shrine and painted roof bosses. Evidence of the 1289 fire was discovered in the form of pieces of fused metal – an amalgam of lead, silver and iron that had melted and penetrated the floor in the heat of the fire. The Office of Works carried out excavations in 1932 in conjunction with work to consolidate the walls and grounds so they could be opened to the public. Further work was carried out by Roy Gilyard Beer between 1947–54 for the Ministry of Works, which exposed more of the site and cleared material from the 19th century.

In 1985–86 Cleveland County Archaeology Section carried out a major excavation of the west end of the nave to consolidate an area of subsidence. Its cause was the collapse of an unrecorded burial vault. The excavations found more evidence of the fire of 1289 including scorched masonry, a shattered bell and broken grave-slabs. The remains of 47 people – 21 men, 17 women, 6 children and 3 of undetermined gender – were discovered, some of whom had been buried with grave goods including a gold finger ring and jet crosses. Two chalices and patens were found alongside the remains of two priests. The skeletons were cremated and the ashes scattered in the Monks&#x27; Walk in the Priory Gardens. A geophysical survey carried out to the west and east of the west range indicated the existence of the remains of other monastic buildings which have yet to be excavated.

<text>Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines are field lines in a fluid flow.
They differ only when the flow changes with time, that is, when the flow is not steady.

Considering a velocity vector field in three-dimensional space in the framework of continuum mechanics: 
* Streamlines are a family of curves whose tangent vectors constitute the velocity vector field of the flow. These show the direction in which a massless fluid element will travel at any point in time.
* Streaklines are the loci of points of all the fluid particles that have passed continuously through a particular spatial point in the past. Dye steadily injected into the fluid at a fixed point (as in dye tracing) extends along a streakline.
* Pathlines are the trajectories that individual fluid particles follow. These can be thought of as &quot;recording&quot; the path of a fluid element in the flow over a certain period. The direction the path takes will be determined by the streamlines of the fluid at each moment in time.

By definition, different streamlines at the same instant in a flow do not intersect, because a fluid particle cannot have two different velocities at the same point. Pathlines are allowed to intersect themselves or other pathlines (except the starting and end points of the different pathlines, which need to be distinct). Streaklines can also intersect themselves and other streaklines.

Streamlines provide a snapshot of some flowfield characteristics, whereas streaklines and pathlines depend on the -history of the flow. Often, sequences of streamlines or streaklines at different instants, presented either in a single image or with a videostream, may provide insight to the flow and its history.

If a line, curve or closed curve is used as start point for a continuous set of streamlines, the result is a stream surface. In the case of a closed curve in a steady flow, fluid that is inside a stream surface must remain forever within that same stream surface, because the streamlines are tangent to the flow velocity. A scalar function whose contour lines define the streamlines is known as the [[stream function]].

== Mathematical description ==

=== Streamlines ===

Streamlines are defined by
formula_1
where &quot;formula_2&quot; denotes the vector cross product and formula_3 is the parametric representation of &quot;just one&quot; streamline at one moment in time.

If the components of the velocity are written formula_4 and those of the streamline as formula_5 then
formula_6
which shows that the curves are parallel to the velocity vector. Here formula_7 is a variable which parametrizes the curve formula_8 Streamlines are calculated instantaneously, meaning that at one instance of time they are calculated throughout the fluid from the instantaneous flow velocity field.

A streamtube consists of a bundle of streamlines, much like communication cable.

The equation of motion of a fluid on a streamline for a flow in a vertical plane is:
formula_9

The flow velocity in the direction formula_7 of the streamline is denoted by formula_11. formula_12 is the radius of curvature of the streamline. The density of the fluid is denoted by formula_13 and the kinematic viscosity by formula_14. formula_15 is the pressure gradient and formula_16 the velocity gradient along the streamline. For a steady flow, the time derivative of the velocity is zero: formula_17. formula_18 denotes the gravitational acceleration.

=== Pathlines ===

Pathlines are defined by
formula_19

The subscript formula_20 indicates a following of the motion of a fluid particle. 
Note that at point formula_21 the curve is parallel to the flow velocity vector formula_22, where the velocity vector is evaluated at the position of the particle formula_21 at that time formula_24.

=== Streaklines ===

Streaklines can be expressed as,
formula_25
where, formula_26 is the velocity of a particle formula_20 at location formula_28 and time formula_24. The parameter formula_30, parametrizes the streakline formula_31 and formula_32, where formula_24 is a time of interest.

== Steady flows ==

In steady flow (when the velocity vector-field does not change with time), the streamlines, pathlines, and streaklines coincide. This is because when a particle on a streamline reaches a point, formula_34, further on that streamline the equations governing the flow will send it in a certain direction formula_35. As the equations that govern the flow remain the same when another particle reaches formula_34 it will also go in the direction formula_35. If the flow is not steady then when the next particle reaches position formula_34 the flow would have changed and the particle will go in a different direction.

This is useful, because it is usually very difficult to look at streamlines in an experiment. If the flow is steady, one can use streaklines to describe the streamline pattern.

== Frame dependence ==

Streamlines are frame-dependent. That is, the streamlines observed in one inertial reference frame are different from those observed in another inertial reference frame. For instance, the streamlines in the air around an aircraft wing are defined differently for the passengers in the aircraft than for an observer on the ground. In the aircraft example, the observer on the ground will observe unsteady flow, and the observers in the aircraft will observe steady flow, with constant streamlines. When possible, fluid dynamicists try to find a reference frame in which the flow is steady, so that they can use experimental methods of creating streaklines to identify the streamlines.

== Application ==

Knowledge of the streamlines can be useful in fluid dynamics. The curvature of a streamline is related to the pressure gradient acting perpendicular to the streamline. The center of curvature of the streamline lies in the direction of decreasing radial pressure. The magnitude of the radial pressure gradient can be calculated directly from the density of the fluid, the curvature of the streamline and the local velocity.

Dye can be used in water, or smoke in air, in order to see streaklines, from which pathlines can be calculated. Streaklines are identical to streamlines for steady flow. Further, dye can be used to create timelines. The patterns guide design modifications, aiming to reduce the drag. This task is known as &quot;streamlining&quot;, and the resulting design is referred to as being &quot;streamlined&quot;. Streamlined objects and organisms, like airfoils, streamliners, cars and dolphins are often aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The Streamline Moderne style, a 1930s and 1940s offshoot of Art Deco, brought flowing lines to architecture and design of the era. The canonical example of a streamlined shape is a chicken egg with the blunt end facing forwards. This shows clearly that the curvature of the front surface can be much steeper than the back of the object. Most drag is caused by eddies in the fluid behind the moving object, and the objective should be to allow the fluid to slow down after passing around the object, and regain pressure, without forming eddies.

The same terms have since become common vernacular to describe any process that smooths an operation. For instance, it is common to hear references to streamlining a business practice, or operation.

<text>A software development kit (SDK) is a collection of software development tools in one installable package. They facilitate the creation of applications by having a compiler, debugger and sometimes a software framework. They are normally specific to a hardware platform and operating system combination. To create applications with advanced functionalities such as advertisements, push notifications, etc; most application software developers use specific software development kits.

Some SDKs are required for developing a platform-specific app. For example, the development of an Android app on the Java platform requires a Java Development Kit. For iOS applications (apps) the iOS SDK is required. For Universal Windows Platform the .NET Framework SDK might be used. There are also SDKs that add additional features and can be installed in apps to provide analytics, data about application activity, and monetization options. Some prominent creators of these types of SDKs include Google, Smaato, InMobi, and Facebook.

==Details==
An SDK can take the form of application programming interfaces in the form of on-device libraries of reusable functions used to interface to a particular programming language, or it may be as complex as hardware-specific tools that can communicate with a particular embedded system. Common tools include debugging facilities and other utilities, often presented in an integrated development environment. SDKs may include sample software and/or technical notes along with documentation, and tutorials to help clarify points made by the primary reference material.

SDKs often include licenses that make them unsuitable for building software intended to be developed under an incompatible license. For example, a proprietary SDK is generally incompatible with free software development, while a GNU General Public License&#x27;d SDK could be incompatible with proprietary software development, for legal reasons. However, SDKs built under the GNU Lesser General Public License are typically usable for proprietary development. In cases where the underlying technology is new, SDKs may include hardware. For example, AirTag&#x27;s 2012 near-field communication SDK included both the paying and the reading halves of the necessary hardware stack. 

The average Android mobile app implements 15.6 separate SDKs, with gaming apps implementing on average 17.5 different SDKs. The most popular SDK categories for Android mobile apps are analytics and advertising.

SDKs can be unsafe (because they are implemented within apps yet run separate code). Malicious SDKs (with honest intentions or not) can violate users&#x27; data privacy, damage app performance, or even cause apps to be banned from Google Play or the App Store. New technologies allow app developers to control and monitor client SDKs in real time.

Providers of SDKs for specific systems or subsystems sometimes substitute a more specific term instead of &quot;software&quot;. For instance, both Microsoft and Citrix provide a driver development kit for developing device drivers.

== Examples==
Examples of software development kits for various platforms include:
*AmigaOS NDK
*Android NDK
*iOS SDK
*Java Development Kit
*Java Web Services Development Pack
*Microsoft Windows SDK
*VaxTele SIP Server SDK
*Visage SDK
*Vuforia Augmented Reality SDK
*Windows App SDK
*Xbox Development Kit

<text>Peter Rosegger (original &quot;Roßegger&quot;) (31 July 1843 – 26 June 1918) was an Austrian writer and poet from Krieglach in the province of Styria. He was a son of a mountain farmer and grew up in the woodlands and mountains of Alpl. Rosegger (or Rossegger) went on to become a most prolific poet and author as well as an insightful teacher and visionary.

In his later years, he was honoured by officials from various Austrian universities and the city of Graz (the capital of Styria). He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature three times. He was nearly awarded the Nobel Prize in 1913 and is (at least among the people of Styria) something like a national treasure to this day.

==Early life==

Rosegger was born as the first of seven children of a peasant couple in the village of Alpl, in the mountains above Krieglach, Styria. The family lived in a simple 18th-century Alpine farmhouse, called &quot;Kluppeneggerhof&quot;. Living conditions were modest, the central room was used for eating, sleeping and working. Food was prepared over a hearth in the scullery. The farmhouse is now part of the Universalmuseum Joanneum, but even today the building ensemble can only be reached by foot.

Since this little village, consisting only of a handful of farms, had neither a church nor a school, Rosegger and the other children would have had to walk down the mountain to the larger village, St. Kathrein, in order to attend either. The way there takes two hours and as a result, Peter had very limited education, largely provided by a wandering teacher who taught him and other children from the region for a year and a half. His physical constitution was not sufficient for him to become a farmer like his father, as he was often sick and rather frail in general. So, he became understudy of a traveling at the age of seventeen.

==Success as a writer==
His interest in literature prevailed, although he earned little money. He spent what he could afford on books and soon began to write himself. Eventually, he was discovered by the publisher of the Graz-based newspaper, &quot;Tagespost&quot;, published by Dr. Svoboda. He realized Rosegger&#x27;s talent as an author and enabled him to attend the Akademie für Handel und Industrie (Academy for Trade and Industries) in Graz.

There, Peter von Reininghaus became his mentor. Von Reininghaus was a wealthy and influential industrialist, and Rosegger had a personal friendship with him for the rest of his life. However, he had a hard time studying, as he was not used to attending school regularly, and had little, and fragmentary, knowledge in many disciplines. He left the academy in 1869 at the age of twenty-six.

Soon after that, he was offered a chance to publish his literary works, namely by Gustav Heckenast, who had worked with Adalbert Stifter before. Peter Rosegger accepted, and his first book, &quot;Geschichten aus der Steiermark&quot; (&quot;Tales from Styria&quot;), was released in 1871.

Rosegger changed to a new publisher twice after Heckenast&#x27;s death, eventually ending up with Ludwig Staackmann, who made him a most generous offer. He had always been very faithful towards his publishers, and the relationship between them was one of friendship and familiarity. Rosegger started to publish &quot;Heimgarten&quot; in 1876, a monthly journal with articles and stories for the people of the country, whose main representative and interpreter he was.

==Character and private life==
In 1873, Rosegger married Anna Pichler. They had two children, but the marriage was short - Anna died giving birth in 1875. This affected Peter to a great degree, as is obvious from various letters he wrote to friends in that time. In 1879, Rosegger married again: Anna Knaur, with whom he had three more children and a very harmonious house life. She also cared for him during his many times of sickness.

He developed many brilliant and extraordinary ideas from the context of his time, and kept contact with unconventional personalities. Rudolf Falb, the creator of the popular &quot;lunisolar flood theory,&quot; was not only his school teacher but remained a lifelong friend. Although feeling strongly connected to his rural homelands, he was a liberal thinker with conservative roots. Fascinated by machines and technology, and being a faithful Christian, he showed a sharp eye for the potentials and advantages, as well as for the dangers and downsides of both the church and the economic development of the late 19th century. As an author he aimed to entertain, to teach and also to help. He called for donations publicly at various occasions or used his influence in academic circles, thus contributing to the founding of one school (in Alpl, his home village), the building of two churches (one in Mürzzuschlag and one in St. Kathrein, rebuilt after it burned down) and other benevolent actions.

==Honors==

In 1903, at his 60th birthday, he was honoured by receiving the &quot;Ehrendoktorwürde&quot; (&quot;Doctor honoris causa&quot;) of the University of Heidelberg. The University of Vienna and the University of Graz also awarded him with similar decorations, and the German emperor Wilhelm II, as well as the Austrian emperor Franz Josef I of Austria gave Rosegger medals of honour (namely, the &quot;Kronenorden 2. Klasse&quot; and the &quot;Ehrenabzeichen für Kunst und Wissenschaft&quot;). He became citizen of honour in Graz and Vienna, and Franz Josef&#x27;s successor Karl presented the ex-farmer-boy-now-national-poet with the Franz-Joseph-medal, a high-ranking accolade for an author.

==Late life and death==
Rosegger, who had been ill frequently and seriously, travelled back to his home in Krieglach in May 1918 in order to die where &quot;the beautiful legend of the forest-farmer boy&quot; had once begun, in the woodlands of the Styrian Alps.

His birth house, the former &quot;Forest School&quot; (Waldschule) he helped to found in Alpl in 1902 and his house in Krieglach, where he lived until his death in 1918, are museums today. The region where he came from (the mountains of the Fischbacher Alps south of Krieglach and Mürzzuschlag) are now unofficially named &quot;Waldheimat&quot; (&quot;Home in the Forest&quot;) after the name he gave it himself. The tourism industry in the region still profits from Rosegger&#x27;s enduring popularity among readers.

<doc id="166093" wikidata="Q151729" url="?curid=166093" title="Süleyman Demirel">
<text>Sami Süleyman Gündoğdu Demirel (; 1 November 1924 – 17 June 2015) was a Turkish politician, engineer, and statesman who served as the 9th President of Turkey from 1993 to 2000. He previously served as the Prime Minister of Turkey seven times between the years 1965 and 1993. He was the leader of the Justice Party (AP) from 1964 to 1980 and the leader of the True Path Party (DYP) from 1987 to 1993.

Having been identified as a potential future prime minister by Adnan Menderes, Demirel was elected leader of the Justice Party in 1964 and managed to bring down the government of İsmet İnönü in 1965 despite not being a Member of Parliament. He supported the government of Suat Hayri Ürgüplü until his party won a parliamentary majority in 1965. He became the first prime minister born in the Republic of Turkey. Claiming that his Justice Party was the successor of the banned Democrat Party, he was re-elected as premier in 1969 by winning a parliamentary majority for a second time. Despite his economic reforms which stabilised inflation, he resigned after his budget was blocked by parliament, but formed his third government shortly after. His premiership came to an end following the 1971 Turkish coup d&#x27;état.

Demirel was the leader of the opposition from 1971 to 1975 before forming a right-wing government known as the First Nationalist Front, which collapsed in 1977. He formed the Second Nationalist Front cabinet in 1977, which collapsed in 1978. Demirel&#x27;s minority government in 1979 was unable to elect a president in 1980, leading to the 1980 Turkish coup d&#x27;état which banned Demirel from politics. Returning to politics in 1987, he assumed the leadership of the True Path Party. He won the 1991 general election and formed a coalition with the Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP), assuming his fifth and final term as prime minister. Following the sudden death of serving President Turgut Özal, Demirel contested the 1993 presidential election and subsequently became the ninth President of Turkey until 2000. With 10 years and 5 months, his tenure as premier is the third longest in Turkish history, after İsmet İnönü and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

==Family==
Süleyman Demirel was born on 1 November 1924, İslamköy, Atabey, a town in Isparta Province to Hacı Yahya Demirel (1894–1972) and Hacı Ümmühan Demirel (1902–1979). 

He was a shepherd in his childhood, which set him apart from the traditional political elite of the country, usually from the military-bureaucratic or the landowning elite, something Demirel used for his public image: because of his rise from a humble background, the rural masses in particular admired him. These conservative masses further identified with him when he projected the image of a proud Muslim, reminding the public that his father did the Hajj, that in his home, the Qur&#x27;an was read on a daily basis when he was a child, or that the name of his village, &quot;İslamköy&quot;, means &quot;village of Islam&quot;.

Upon completing elementary school in his hometown, he attended middle and high schools in Isparta, Muğla, and Afyon. In 1948, he married Nazmiye Şener, his second cousin.

==Engineering career==
After graduating from the school of civil engineering at the Istanbul Technical University in 1949, Süleyman Demirel worked in the State Department for electrical power planning. He undertook postgraduate studies on irrigation, electrical technologies, and dam construction in the United States, first in 1949–1950, then in 1954–1955. During the construction of the Seyhan Dam, Demirel worked as a project engineer and in 1954 was appointed director of the Department of Dams. In 1955, he served as director general of the State Hydraulic Works (DSİ). As such, Demirel supervised the construction of a various power plants, dams and irrigation facilities. Eisenhower Fellowships selected Süleyman Demirel in 1954 to represent Turkey.

After the coup d&#x27;état in 1960, he was drafted to the Turkish Army for compulsory military service. Upon completion of his military service, he worked as a freelance engineer and a representative of the Morrison Construction Company, a U.S. company. During this period, he also worked as a part-time lecturer of hydraulic engineering at the Middle East Technical University (ODTÜ) in Ankara.

==Entry to politics==
His political career started with his election to the executive board of the Justice Party, founded by the former general Ragıp Gümüşpala as a replacement of the Democrat Party that was banned after the military coup of 27 May 1960. Journalist and MP Cihat Baban claims in &quot;The Gallery of Politics (Politika Galerisi)&quot;, that President Cemal Gürsel told him:

Demirel&#x27;s rural, central Anatolian accent and the fact that he came from a village from the countryside made him very appealing to rural voters.

On 22 March 1963, the imprisoned former president Celal Bayar was released on parole, causing protests in front of Justice Party headquarters. Demirel resigned from his position during the ordeal, and claimed that &quot;There wouldn&#x27;t be democracy in this country for another 50 years&quot;. He remained politically inactive until the death of Ragıp Gümüşpala in June 1964 when he re-entered politics as a candidate for chairman of the party. However, Demirel faced strong opposition. His biggest rival was Sadettin Bilgiç, nicknamed &quot;koca reis&quot; (Turkish: &quot;big captain&quot;). Bilgiç supporters accused Demirel of being a freemason; While this was true, Demirel averted the crisis with a lie. Instead of writing to his own lodge, he petitioned a separate freemason&#x27;s lodge asking whether he was a member or not. As expected, the lodge chairman answered negatively. This turned the tide in Demirel&#x27;s favor, and he received enough votes to become the chairman of the Justice Party, receiving 1,072 votes to Bilgiç&#x27;s 552, and Tekin Arıburun&#x27;s 39.

Demirel was elected chairman at the second grand party convention on 28 November 1964. He facilitated the formation of a caretaker government that ruled between February and October 1965 under the premiership of Suat Hayri Ürgüplü in which he served as Deputy Prime Minister. Under his leadership, the Justice Party won an unprecedented majority of the votes in the 1965 general election and formed a majority government. Demirel thus became the youngest-ever Prime Minister in Turkish history at the age of 40.

== First premiership ==
Demirel was one of the first of a new generation born in the 1920s that were now entering politics known as the &quot;Republican Generation&quot;, during which heroes of the Turkish War of Independence such as İsmet İnönü, Celâl Bayar and Ragıp Gümüşpala were gradually withdrawing from politics.

Shortly after coming to power he faced was the &quot;Presidential crisis&quot; when Cemal Gürsel, who assumed the presidency after the adoption of the 1961 Constitution, stated that his poor health prevented him from continuing his duty. Demirel nominated the Chief of the General Staff, Cevdet Sunay for the presidency in order to soften the army&#x27;s attitude towards the Justice Party, who became president in 1966.

In the next elections on 10 October 1969, his party was the sole winner by a landslide once again. Demirel presided over the laying the foundations of the Keban Dam, the Bosphorus Bridge and an oil pipeline between Batman and İskenderun. Economic reforms stabilized inflation, and Turkey became one of the fastest growing economies. However boycotts and strikes by university students in 1968 began political instability which especially concerned the Turkish military. Pressure was also mounting from the United States, as the Nixon Administration wished for Turkey to ban the cultivation of opium, which would have been politically costly for Demirel to implement. Demirel also had trouble brewing inside his own party, as while he attempted to issue an amnesty to ex-Democrats, he was effectively vetoed by the armed forces. As a result, in 1970, several ex-DP deputies left the Justice Party to found the Democratic Party, while the Islamists also left to found the National Order Party under Necmettin Erbakan.

==The chaotic seventies==
=== 1971 memorandum===

A worsening economy, the 15–16 June events, one of the biggest workers&#x27; protests in the history of Turkey; disagreements between the government and military over the Cyprus dispute, escalations of tensions with Greece, and conflict between leftists and rightists served to define the last years of Demirel&#x27;s first premiership as politically unstable. He blamed the liberal constitution for the crisis. He resigned as prime minister after his budget was blocked by parliament but formed his third government shortly after. A military coup attempt by National Democratic Revolutionaries on 9 March 1971 finally resulted in a direct military intervention on 12 March, and Demirel resigned for a military-supported government under Nihat Erim.

The constitutional amendments that Demirel wished for were implemented during technocratic military governance which relied on support from parliament. In the spring of 1973, with the presidential election on the agenda, to counter the army&#x27;s influence over national politics, he reached an agreement with the new leader of the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP), Bülent Ecevit, to support Fahri Korutürk as president instead of former chief of staff of Turkish Military Faruk Gürler. During the election process, tanks were positioned near Grand National Assembly of Turkey to indicate to MPs that the armed forces might intervene.

===Nationalist Front governments===
With the Justice Party emerging second in the general election in 1973, a grand CHP-AP coalition was expected. However, Demirel announced that &quot;We can only come together in war.&quot; CHP instead formed a coalition with Erbakan&#x27;s new Islamist party, the National Salvation Party (MSP). Ecevit&#x27;s government carried out the Invasion of Cyprus, but ideological conflicts in the government prompted Ecevit to resign on 18 September 1974 and hold early elections. However early elections never happened, and instead Sadi Irmak had to head a caretaker government that lasted for 194 days from 18 September until 31 March, when, under the leadership of Demirel, a right-wing coalition government, the &quot;First Nationalist Front&quot;, was established consisting of the Justice Party, MSP, the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), and the Republican Reliance Party. In order for the coalition to survive, Islamist MSP supporters and ultranationalist MHP members were recruited within state institutions, intensifying the renewed political violence of the 1970s; 42 people were killed in a 1977 May Day rally at Taksim Square. The country entered an economic depression caused by a rise in global petrol prices, deficit in foreign payments and rapid inflation. Süleyman Demirel&#x27;s nephew, Yahya Kemal Demirel, was arrested for corruption after an investigation by the journalist Uğur Mumcu during this period.

Despite gaining support in the 1977 elections the Justice Party again lost to CHP, which received 41.4 percent of the vote. However, Ecevit was not able to form a government, so Demirel became prime minister again, forming the Second Nationalist Front with only MSP and MHP. This government fell in a no-confidence vote on 31 December 1977, in what was known as the Güneş Motel Incident, where 13 Justice Party MPs defected from their party to support a CHP government where they received cabinet positions. Demirel refused to establish a dialogue with the CHP-dominated government and conducted a vicious opposition to Ecevit by referring to him as &quot;head of government&quot; instead of &quot;prime minister&quot;. Referring to Ecevit&#x27;s government, Demirel said &quot;In no country in the world, could such a government [Ecevit&#x27;s] with 1200 deaths, 70% inflation, disrepute, cruelty, torture, unjust and merciless partisanship stand for even one day. A cadre that has exceeded its ambition has usurped the administration.&quot; On 21 February 1979, he announced to President Korutürk that they were against the extension of martial law.

The troubles brought by American embargo, inflation, and escalating political violence meant Ecevit lost the 1979 by-elections, prompting his resignation. Demirel returned as prime minister, and established a minority government due to the negative atmosphere created by the Nationalist Front governments (MSP and MHP still provided confidence). His last premiership before the 1980 coup saw the implementation of the 24 January decisions which proved to be a turning point in Turkey&#x27;s transition to a neoliberal economy. With political violence and assassinations at an all-time high, top military generals delivered a memorandum to President Korutürk, urging for politicians to put aside their differences to solve the country&#x27;s problems, but this memorandum did nothing to get Demirel and Ecevit to cooperate. As Fahri Korutürk&#x27;s presidential term was ending, a crisis brewed as to who would succeed him, with Demirel and Ecevit failing 115 times to elect a new president. Demirel&#x27;s government lasted until the coup of 12 September 1980, which banned him from politics.

Demirel opened 268 İmam Hatip schools in his premierships between 1965 and 1980, becoming one of the politicians who opened the most İmam Hatip schools.

==Ban from politics==

With the military coup on 12 September 1980, Demirel&#x27;s prime ministry ended and he was kept under surveillance in Hamzaköy, Gelibolu for a month. He did not resign as chairman of the Justice Party until it was dissolved in 1981. With a provisional article in the new Constitution, he and most politicians were banned from politics for 10 years. However, he maintained ties with his party&#x27;s former leaders. After political parties were allowed to be established in May 1983, Demirel declared, &quot;I do not build shanty houses on my land with a title deed.&quot; He did not support the party that the military administration tried to have Bülend Ulusu founded, the Nationalist Democracy Party, nor the Motherland Party (ANAP) led by his protégé Turgut Özal. On 20 May 1983, the Great Turkey Party (BTP) was established by former Justice Party members, but it was swiftly banned by the National Security Council on the grounds that it was a continuation of the Justice Party. Demirel, along with former CHP and Justice Party members was forced to stay for four months in Zincirbozan, Çanakkale, on the grounds that he violated the political ban.

== Last premiership ==
In 1986, Demirel launched a successful campaign for the lifting of pre-1980 politicians&#x27; political bans and initiated a referendum on the issue. Only 18 days after his political ban was rescinded, he was elected chairman at the extraordinary convention of the True Path Party (DYP), a new successor party to the Justice Party. He was re-elected Deputy of Isparta in the 1987 general election.

Following the 1991 election, Süleyman Demirel became prime minister once again in a coalition government with the Social Democratic Populist Party. Demirel acknowledged the distinction of Kurds being a different ethnicity from Turks, reformed criminal procedure law, removed the ban on all party names and abbreviations accumulated from military coups, and ratified international conventions on trade union freedoms. The &quot;Green Card&quot; social security program was also established and the age requirement for retirement was abolished. While the government had success combating far-left terrorist groups, the assassinations of journalist Uğur Mumcu and Gendarme commander Eşref Bitlis shocked the country. Though both coalition partners advocated for ending the OHAL zone and the village guard system in southeast Anatolia, Operation Provide Comfort meant the policies had to continue in the unstable region.

During this period, he carried out a strong opposition to his protégé and soon president, Turgut Özal, with whom he prepared the 24 January Decisions.

==Presidency==
After the sudden death of Özal, Demirel was elected the ninth President of Turkey in 1993 by the Grand National Assembly. Resigning his party chairmanship, his successor for leadership of DYP became Turkey&#x27;s first female prime minister, Tansu Çiller.

President Demirel drew backlash from statements he made in the aftermath of the Sivas Massacre in which 35 intellectuals –most of whom were Alevi– lost their lives when they were trapped in a burning hotel by a mob, which took place just one and a half months after he became president. He said, &quot;The incident is an isolated incident. There was heavy provocation. As a result of this provocation, the people were agitated... The security forces did their best... There was no conflict between the groups. There was [only] loss of life due to the burning of the hotel.&quot;

Demirel gave Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev advanced notice of an upcoming coup attempt against his government backed by various factions of the Turkish army and intelligence services. President Demirel survived an assassination attempt in 1996 in a ribbon-cutting ceremony to open a shopping mall in İzmit. The would be assassin, İbrahim Gümrükçüoğlu said in his defence that he did not intend to kill the president, but that he intended to shoot into the air with his pistol to protest Turkey&#x27;s military cooperation agreement with Israel. Doctors later diagnosed Gümrükçüoğlu with paranoia.

Demirel&#x27;s role in the 1997 &quot;Postmodern Coup&quot; is controversial, with some accusing him of leading the effort to bring down Necmittin Erbakan&#x27;s REFAHYOL government while others claimed that he prevented a complete military takeover by easing the tension. He did not appoint his once protegé Tansu Çiller prime minister after the ordeal, but instead ANAP chairman Mesut Yılmaz. Erbakan&#x27;s Welfare Party, Ciller&#x27;s DYP and the BBP opposed the move.

In 1997, Demirel participated in a conference organized by the Journalists and Writers Foundation, of which Fethullah Gülen was its honorary chairman, and received the &quot;Statesman National Reconciliation Award&quot; from him.

Though there was an attempt to extend his presidential term by another five years, Demirel stepped down from the presidency on 5 April. He handed over his duty to Ahmet Necdet Sezer on 16 May 2000. With his retirement from politics, his overall tenure as prime minister was shorter than only İsmet İnönü&#x27;s and Recep Tayyip Erdogan&#x27;s.

==Later life and death==
Following his retirement from politics, Demirel was a frequent panelist and speaker at several events, mostly in universities, within Turkey.

Demirel was a member of the committee that drafted the Mitchell Report in 2001, which investigated the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the midst of the Second Intifada and offered recommendations to reduce tensions. 

His wife Nazmiye died on 27 May 2013, in the hospital where she was treated for Alzheimer&#x27;s.

Süleyman Demirel died on 17 June 2015 at the Güven hospital in Ankara where he had been undergoing treatment for a respiratory tract infection. After the state ceremony in the Turkish Grand National Assembly and a religious ceremony at Kocatepe Mosque on 19 June 2015, Demirel&#x27;s body was taken to a mausoleum in his hometown of Atabey, Isparta. In 2019, the Süleyman Demirel Mausoleum was completed and opened to visitors.

==Legacy==
Demirel achieved many firsts throughout his political career. He formed the most governments, was longest serving prime minister in Turkish political history following İsmet İnönü and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and was the youngest prime minister at the age of 41. He also broke the records for the youngest politician to become a party leader at the age of 40, and the youngest general manager appointed to a public institution at the age of 30.

The Süleyman Demirel Airport and Süleyman Demirel University, both of which are in Isparta are named after him. So are the Süleyman Demirel Stadium in Antalya, the Süleyman Demirel Medical Centre of the Atatürk University in Erzurum and Suleyman Demirel University in Kazakhstan. There are also two important main streets named after him: one in Istanbul and the other in Muğla. In 2014 Süleyman Demirel Democracy and Development Museum was opened in Isparta.

==In popular culture==
Süleyman Demirel was often nicknamed &quot;Baba&quot; (&quot;The Father&quot;) or &quot;Çoban Sülü&quot; (&quot;Sülü the Shepherd&quot;) and humorously &quot;Spartacus&quot;, after his native city of Isparta. His fedora hat was a famous part of his image.

With the song &quot;Demirbaş&quot; on the album &quot;Yadigâr&quot; (1995), Fikret Kızılok humorously described Demirel&#x27;s inability to stay away from the political scene. &quot;Süleyman&quot;, one of the hit songs of Barış Manço&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Mega Manço&quot;, was another satire of Demirel. He was portrayed by Haldun Boysan in the 2007 movie &quot;Zincirbozan&quot;. There are also references to Demirel in Cem Karaca&#x27;s &quot;Raptiye&quot;. Demirel appeared as a guest actor in the film &quot;The President in the Other Turkey&quot;. Nejmi Aykar portrayed Demirel in the TV series &quot;Once Upon a Time in Cyprus&quot;, which was broadcast on TRT 1.

Although Demirel had retired, whenever there was political distress, Turkish media or his followers (humorously or otherwise) called on him with the words &quot;Kurtar bizi baba&quot; (&quot;Father, save us&quot;). 

=== Quotes ===
Demirel was a skillful orator and is known for producing many memorable quotes and quips with journalists.

His most famous quote is &quot;Dün dündür, bugün bugündür&quot; (&quot;Yesterday is yesterday, today is today&quot;), which he said in response to those questioning his pragmatism. However he would also say: &quot;Not everybody can wriggle out of the issue by saying &#x27;Yesterday was yesterday, today is today&#x27; like I did.&quot; 

&quot;Benzin vardı da biz mi içtik?&quot; (&quot;Did we drink the gasoline, as if there were any?&quot;), he said when defending his actions during the 1970s energy crisis.

When speaking to a reporter when tensions were heightened with Greece due to the Aegean dispute he said: &quot;Ege bir Yunan gölü değildir. Ege bir Türk gölü de değildir. Binaenaleyh Ege bir göl değildir.&quot; (&quot;The Aegean is not a Greek lake. The Aegean is not a Turkish lake. Therefore, the Aegean is not even a lake.&quot;)
