<doc id="158546" wikidata="Q4817576" url="?curid=158546" title="Mass media in the United States">
<text>There are several types of mass media in the United States: television, radio, cinema, newspapers, magazines, and websites. The U.S. also has a strong music industry. New York City, Manhattan in particular, and to a lesser extent Los Angeles, are considered the epicenters of U.S. media.

Many media entities are controlled by large for-profit corporations who reap revenue from advertising, subscriptions, and sale of copyrighted material.
American media conglomerates tend to be leading global players, generating large revenues as well as large opposition in many parts of the world. With the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, further deregulation and convergence are under way, leading to mega-mergers, further concentration of media ownership, and the emergence of multinational media conglomerates. These mergers enable tighter control of information. Currently, a handful of corporations control the vast majority of both digital and legacy media. Critics allege that localism, local news and other content at the community level, media spending and coverage of news, and diversity of ownership and views have suffered as a result of these processes of media concentration.

Theories to explain the success of such companies include reliance on certain policies of the American federal government or a tendency to natural monopolies in the industry, with a corporate media bias.

The organization Reporters Without Borders compiles and publishes an annual ranking of countries based upon the organization&#x27;s assessment of their press freedom records. In 2023–24, United States was ranked 55th out of 180 countries (a drop of ten places from the previous year) and was given a &quot;problematic&quot; rating. A 2022 Gallup poll showed that only 11% of Americans trust television news and 16% trust newspapers. On the future of Spanish-language media in the U.S., Alberto Avendaño, ex-director of El Tiempo Latino/Washington Post, claimed that &quot;Hispanic-American&quot; news coverage in the English-language media is &quot;absolutely pathetic,&quot; but he was optimistic, arguing that demographic shifts would inevitably render the Latino media a significant presence in the context of American media.

According to a May 2023 AP-NORC poll, 74% of respondents said the media is to blame for increased political polarization in the United States.

==Newspapers==


After being widely successful in the 20th century, newspapers have declined in their influence and penetration into American households over the years. The U.S. does not have a national paper. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and &quot;USA Today&quot; are the most circulated newspapers in the United States and are sold in most U.S. cities.

Although the primary audience for &quot;The New York Times&quot; (NYT) had initially been the residents of New York City and its surrounding metropolitan region, the NYT, nicknamed &quot;the Grey Lady&quot; and which has won the most Pulitzer Prizes of any publication, has gradually become the dominant &quot;newspaper of record&quot; for the U.S. media. Apart from its daily nationwide distribution, the term means that back issues are archived on microfilm by every decent-sized public library in the nation, and the Times&#x27; articles are often cited by both historians and judges as evidence that a major historical event occurred on a certain date. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; are also newspapers of record, to a lesser extent. Although &quot;USA Today&quot; has tried to establish itself as a national paper, it has been widely derided by the academic world as the &quot;McPaper&quot; and is not subscribed to or archived by most libraries.

Apart from the aforementioned newspapers, all major metropolitan areas have their own local newspapers. Most metropolitan areas will generally support one or two major newspapers, with many smaller publications targeted towards particular audiences. Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major news agency wire service, such as the Associated Press, Bloomberg, and Reuters for their national and world coverage.

With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families.

Most general-purpose newspapers are either being printed one time a week, usually on Thursday or Friday, or are printed daily. Weekly newspapers tend to have much smaller circulation and are more prevalent in rural communities or small towns. Major cities often have &quot;alternative weeklies&quot; to complement the mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City&#x27;s &quot;Village Voice&quot; or Los Angeles&#x27; &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot;, to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups.

As competition from other media has evolved, the number of daily newspapers in the U.S. has declined over the past half-century, according to &quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot;, the trade journal of American newspapers. In particular, the number of evening newspapers has fallen by almost one-half since 1970, while the number of morning editions and Sunday editions has grown.

For comparison, in 1950, there were 1,772 daily papers (and 1,450 – or about 70 percent – of them were evening papers) while in 2000, there were 1,480 daily papers (and 766—or about half—of them were evening papers.)

Daily newspaper circulation is also slowly declining in America, partly due to the near-demise of two-newspaper towns, as the weaker newspapers in most cities have folded:
The primary source of newspaper income is advertising – in the form of &quot;classifieds&quot; or inserted advertising circulars – rather than circulation income. However, since the late 1990s, this revenue source has been directly challenged by Web sites like eBay (for sales of secondhand items), Monster.com (jobs), and Craigslist (everything).

Additionally, as investigative journalism declined at major daily newspapers in the 2000s, many reporters formed their own non-profit investigative newsrooms. Examples include ProPublica on the national level, Texas Tribune at the state level and Voice of OC at the local level.

The largest newspapers (by circulation) in the United States are &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

In August 2019, it was announced that New Media Investment Group had agreed to buy Gannett, and operations would continue under the Gannett rather than GateHouse name, at the Gannett headquarters but under New Media&#x27;s CEO. The acquisition of Gannett by New Media Investment Group was completed on November 19, 2019, making the combined company the largest newspaper publisher in the United States. Immediately after the merger was finalized, all GateHouse Media URLs began redirecting to Gannett.com.

La Opinión is the most read newspaper website in the United States, reaching more than 6 million readers each month. It is the largest Spanish-language newspaper in the United States and the second-most read newspaper in Los Angeles (after The Los Angeles Times).

==Magazines==
Thanks to the huge size of the English-speaking North American media market, the United States has a large magazine industry with hundreds of magazines serving almost every interest, as can be determined by glancing at any newsstand in any large American city. Most magazines are owned by one of the large media conglomerates or by one of their smaller regional brethren. The American Society of Magazine Editors sponsors the annual National Magazine Awards recognizing excellence.

The U.S. has three leading weekly news magazines: &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; are center-left while &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; tends to be center-right. &quot;Time&quot; is well known for naming a &quot;Person of the Year&quot; each year, while &quot;U.S. News&quot; publishes annual ratings of American colleges and universities.

The U.S. also has over a dozen major political magazines, including &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; among others. In entertainment the magazines Variety, The Hollywood Reporter, Rolling Stone, L.A. Record and Billboard are very popular. In arts Smithsonian and Art in America magazines are major magazines.

Finally, besides the hundreds of specialized magazines that serve the diverse interests like Vanity Fair, People, Maxim, Consumer Reports, Sports Illustrated, and fashion magazines, like Vogue, Glamour, GQ, InStyle, Cosmopolitan and hobbies of the American people, like Motor Trend, Health, AARP the Magazine, Good Housekeeping, Bon Appétit, and Saveur there are also dozens of magazines published by professional organizations for their members, such as &quot;Scientific American for scientists, &quot;Communications of the ACM&quot; (for computer science specialists), &quot;IEEE Spectrum&quot; (for engineers), the &quot;ABA Journal&quot; (for lawyers), Businessweek and Forbes for business, Architectural Digest and Architectural Record for architects.

El Nuevo Cojo (Los Angeles), and Two Mundos Magazine (Miami) are two bilingual (English/Spanish) lifestyle and entertainment magazines. It&#x27;s not a coordinated exodus for magazines in the United States but the transition from print&#x27;s primacy to digital&#x27;s that has started at the turn of the century.

==Radio==
American radio broadcasts in two bands: FM and AM. Some stations are only talk radio – featuring interviews and discussions – while music radio stations broadcast one particular type of music: Top 40, hip-hop, country, etc. Radio broadcast companies have become increasingly consolidated in recent years. National Public Radio is the nation&#x27;s primary public radio network, but most radio stations are commercial and profit-oriented.

Talk radio as a political medium has also exploded in popularity during the 1990s, due to the 1987 repeal of the Fairness Doctrine, which meant that stations no longer had to &quot;balance&quot; their day by programming alternative points of view.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1970 had limited the number of radio station one person or company could own to 1 am and 1 FM locally, and 7 am and 7 FM stations nationally. But due to extensive concentration of media ownership stemming from the Telecommunications Act of 1996, radio companies could own not more than 8 local stations per area market. Most stations are now owned by major radio companies such as iHeartMedia (formerly Clear Channel Communications), Cumulus Media, Townsquare Media and Audacy (Formerly Entercom). See IBOC and HD Radio.

A new form of radio that is gaining popularity is satellite radio. The two biggest subscriptions based radio services are Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio, which have recently merged to form Sirius XM Radio. Unlike terrestrial radio music channels are commercial free and other channels feature minimal commercials. Satellite radio also is not regulated by the FCC.

During the advent of the internet in the 21st century, internet radio and digital streaming services have been emerged. Among popular brands are Pandora, Spotify and iHeartRadio. Although, the recording industry also sees Internet radio as a threat and has attempted to impose high royalty rates for the use of recorded music to discourage independent stations from playing popular songs. Spotify listeners can choose the songs they want to play, when they want to play them. ... Pandora is a way for users to discover new music that matches their tastes, while Spotify—even though it offers radio stations, too—is better suited to stream and share music that users already know and love.

Nielsen Audio, formerly known as Arbitron, is consumer research company that provides ratings (similar to the Nielsen ratings) for national and local radio stations in the United States.

Digital Audio Broadcasting goal is to replace FM broadcasting and become the future of radio. Some industry experts are wary of this new transmission method. ... However, this method of transmission could benefit internet radio stations that want to develop local coverage and keep up to speed with FM radio stations.

==Television==

Ninety-nine percent of American households have at least one television and the majority of households have more than one. The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), CBS (formerly the Columbia Broadcasting System), the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox). On August 13, 2019, CBS and Viacom officially announced their intention to merge, with the combined company to be named ViacomCBS. The merger was completed on December 4, 2019. The company will have 50% interest in The CW.
Several Spanish language broadcast (as well as cable) networks exist, which are the most common form of non-English television broadcasts. These networks are not as widely distributed over-the-air as their English counterparts, available mostly in markets with sizable Latino and Hispanic populations; several of these over-the-air networks are alternatively fed directly to cable, satellite and IPTV providers in markets without either the availability or the demand for a locally based owned-and-operated or affiliate station.

The largest of these networks, Univision, launched in 1986 as a successor to the Spanish International Network. Its major competition is Telemundo (est. 1986), a sister network of NBC (which acquired Telemundo in 2001). Founded: 2009 Estrella TV is another Spanish-language broadcast television network.

Public television has a far smaller role than in most other countries. However, a number of states, including West Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, and South Carolina, among others, do have state-owned public broadcasting authorities which operate and fund all public television stations in their respective states. The income received from the government is insufficient to cover expenses and stations also rely on corporate sponsorships and viewer contributions.

DirecTV and Dish Network are the major satellite television providers, with 20 and 14 million customers respectively as of February 2014. Meanwhile, the major cable television providers are Comcast with 22 million customers, Charter Communications with 17 million, and Cox Communications, AT&amp;T U-verse and Verizon Fios with 5–6 million each.

==Motion pictures==
In the 20th century, the motion picture industry rose to become one of the most successful and powerful industries in the U.S. Along with other intellectual property industries, its relative importance to the American economy has strengthened as the importance of manufacturing and agriculture have decreased (due to globalization).

===Rise of the home video market (1980s–1990s)===
The 1980s and 1990s saw another significant development. The full acceptance of home video by studios opened a vast new business to exploit. Films such as &quot;Showgirls&quot;, &quot;The Secret of NIMH,&quot; and &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, which may have performed poorly in their theatrical run, were now able to find success in the video market. It also saw the first generation of filmmakers with access to videotapes emerge. Directors such as Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson had been able to view thousands of films and produced films with vast numbers of references and connections to previous works. Tarantino has had a number of collaborations with director Robert Rodriguez. Rodriguez directed the 1992 action film &quot;El Mariachi&quot;, which was a commercial success after grossing $2 million against an initial before-production budget of $7,000. In 2011, &quot;El Mariachi&quot; was inducted into the Library of Congress to be preserved as part of its National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film is further immortalized by Guinness World Records as the lowest-budgeted film ever to gross $1 million at the box office. This was possible thanks to the explosion of independent film enabled by ever-decreasing costs for filmmaking. With the rise of the DVD in the 21st century, DVDs have quickly become even more profitable to studios and have led to an explosion of packaging extra scenes, extended versions, and commentary tracks with the films.

===Rise of digital distribution===
DVD and high-definition Blu-ray sales have substantially declined with the rise of video on demand, especially over-the-top streaming services. The range of viewing devices went through another mass expansion with the popularization of tablet computers and smartphones.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, drive-in theaters reported an unexpected surge in attendance in several U.S. states as, unlike with indoor theaters unable to operate because of bans on mass gatherings, these were allowed to operate.

==Video games==
The United States has the largest video games presence in the world in terms of total industry employees. In 2017, the U.S. game industry as a whole was worth US$18.4 billion and consisted of roughly 2457 companies that had a rough total of 220,000 people employed. U.S. video game revenue is forecast to reach $230 billion by 2022, making it the largest video game market in the world. Over 150 million Americans play video games, with an average age of 35 and a gender breakdown of 59 percent male and 41 percent female.

In 2011, the average American gamer spent an average of 13 hours per week playing video games.

==Internet==

The Internet has provided a means for newspapers and other media organizations to deliver news and keep archives public. Revenue is generated through advertising or subscription payments. Aside from web portals and search engines like Google, the number one visited website in the United States, popular websites include Instagram, TikTok, Apple, Netflix, Hulu, Microsoft, YouTube, Wikipedia, Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter), Amazon, Yelp, IMDb, Reddit, Pinterest, eBay, TripAdvisor, Indeed, Spotify, Merriam-Webster, Quora, Fandom and Twitch.

===Online streaming===
Online streaming now makes it possible to watch everything from live news and sports to classic movies to modern TV favorites in their own time, on any device. With the popularity of online streaming rising cable companies are having to extend offers to compete in this 655 billion dollar digital market.

The Amazon Unbox and Crackle over-the-top video on demand streaming services launched in 2006, then Netflix and Hulu followed in 2007. CBS All Access and Tubi were unveiled in 2014, and YouTube Red in 2015. Disney+ and Apple TV+, launched in 2019. HBO Max and Peacock launched in 2020.

Virtual MVPDs are over-the-top live video streaming services that mirrored cable and TV Everywhere bundled services, priced at lower monthly rates than packages offered by traditional pay television system operators. Sling TV, PlayStation Vue and fuboTV were launched in 2015. DirecTV Now followed in 2016. and Philo in 2017. New York magazine has a Vulture&#x27;s streaming guide to the TV Shows and movies available for streaming on Netflix, Amazon, HBO, and Hulu. The term &quot;streaming wars&quot; was coined to discuss the new era of competition between video streaming services such as Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, Funimation, Crunchyroll, etc.

==Broadcast and entertainment cross-ownership==

Most of the current major film studios have become part of corporate conglomerates that also include major television broadcast networks and some of the most popular news and entertainment cable television channels. Sony Pictures has been an exception, and Fox sold its film properties to Disney in 2019, retaining its television and radio broadcast operations. All of the major entertainment companies have launched streaming services as they face competition from new media companies. Amazon purchased Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, one of the &quot;big five&quot; studios in the Golden Age of Hollywood, in 2022. Comcast is also a major Internet service provider, representing a high degree of vertical integration.

This conglomeration gives owners the ability to reuse the same content between theaters, broadcast, and streaming, and to use intellectual property from media franchises they own, across businesses without worrying about licensing. Some owners have extended their franchises into in-person theme parks and video games. Constantly looking for fresh source material, the major entertainment companies often compete to buy the rights to adapt books and independent films; Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery own the country&#x27;s top two comic book publishers. Some media franchises are also cross-licensed, especially for streaming and theme parks.

<text>Nathan Freudenthal Leopold Jr. (November 19, 1904 – August 29, 1971) and Richard Albert Loeb (; June 11, 1905 – January 28, 1936), usually referred to collectively as Leopold and Loeb, were two American students at the University of Chicago who kidnapped and murdered 14-year-old Bobby Franks in Chicago, Illinois, United States, on May 21, 1924. They committed the murder – characterized at the time as &quot;the crime of the century&quot; – hoping to demonstrate superior intellect, which they believed enabled and entitled them to carry out a &quot;perfect crime&quot; without consequences.

After the two men were arrested, Leopold and Loeb&#x27;s families retained Clarence Darrow as lead counsel for their defense. Darrow&#x27;s eight-hour summation at their sentencing hearing is noted for its influential criticism of capital punishment as retributive rather than transformative justice. Both men were sentenced to life imprisonment plus 99 years. Loeb was murdered by a fellow prisoner in 1936. Leopold was released on parole in 1958. The case has since served as the inspiration for several dramatic works.

== Early lives ==
=== Nathan Leopold ===
Nathan Freudenthal Leopold Jr. was born on November 19, 1904, in Chicago, Illinois, the third son of Florence (née Foreman) and Nathan Leopold Sr., a wealthy German-Jewish immigrant family. A child prodigy, Leopold was recorded in his baby book as having spoken his first words at the age of four months and three weeks old. Leopold began his college studies at the University of Chicago, transferred to the University of Michigan, but returned after a year to study at the University of Chicago. At the time of the murder, he had completed an undergraduate degree at the University of Chicago with Phi Beta Kappa honors and planned to begin studies at Harvard Law School after a trip to Europe.

By many accounts, Leopold was sensitive about his appearance. He threw himself into intellectual pursuits where he met with remarkable success. Leopold had studied 15 languages and claimed to speak five fluently. He had achieved a measure of national recognition as an ornithologist. Leopold and several other ornithologists identified nesting sites of Kirtland&#x27;s warblers and made astute observations about the parasitic nesting behavior of brown-headed cowbirds, which threatened the warblers. He maintained his interest in birds after his crime, raising birds in prison and working to help with the struggling Puerto Rican Parrot population after his release on parole.

=== Richard Loeb ===
Richard Albert Loeb was born on June 11, 1905, in Chicago, the third of four sons of Anna Henrietta (née Bohnen) and Albert Henry Loeb, a wealthy lawyer and retired vice president of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company. His father was Jewish and his mother was Catholic. Like Leopold, Loeb was exceptionally intelligent. He was an avid reader, with a passion for history and crime stories. At age 12, he entered the innovative University of Chicago High School. With the encouragement of his governess, he completed his high school education in two years. In 1923, at the age of 17, he would reportedly become the University of Michigan&#x27;s youngest graduate. Following graduation from Michigan, Loeb enrolled in a few history classes at the University of Chicago.

== Adolescence and early crimes ==
The two young men grew up with their families in the affluent Kenwood neighborhood on Chicago&#x27;s South Side. The Loebs owned a summer estate (the farm part of which is now called Castle Farms and is a popular wedding venue) in Charlevoix, Michigan, as well as a mansion in Kenwood, two blocks from the Leopold home.

Though Leopold and Loeb knew each other casually while growing up, they began to see more of each other in the spring of 1920; their relationship flourished at the University of Chicago, as part of a mutual friend group. Their sexual relationship began in February 1921 and continued until the pair was arrested. 

Since childhood Loeb had been stealing small things from friends, family and stores. He would sometimes show off his pick-pocketing skills to friends in high school in an attempt to impress them. When Loeb met Leopold the pair began to steal things together, and worked out a system to cheat their friends and family during games of bridge, though it was largely unsuccessful. They also upgraded to larger crimes, including breaking into people&#x27;s homes to steal things like wine, piano benches and vacuum cleaners. The pair would also drive around throwing bricks through car and store windows and committed several acts of arson, enjoying setting a building on fire, driving away, changing clothes, and then chatting with others who came out to watch the firefighters attempt to put out their blaze.

While Loeb seems to have been content to do these things for fun, Leopold felt the need to justify them philosophically. He was an individual hedonist, as he explained it, he would weigh all of the pleasure or pain he would receive from an action, and do what would give him the most pleasure. This extended to every arena of his life, including his eventual decision to commit murder. As he explained to a psychiatrist: “Making up my mind to commit murder was practically the same as making up my mind whether or not I should eat pie for supper, whether it would give me pleasure or not.” 

Leopold was also interested in Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s concept of &quot;supermen&quot; (&quot;Übermenschen&quot;), interpreting them as transcendent individuals possessing extraordinary and unusual capabilities, whose superior intellects allowed them to rise above the laws and rules that bound the unimportant, average populace. Leopold believed it was possible that he and Loeb could become such individuals, and as such, by his interpretation of Nietzsche&#x27;s doctrines, they were not bound by any of society&#x27;s normal ethics or rules. In a letter to Loeb, he wrote, &quot;A superman ... is, on account of certain superior qualities inherent in him, exempted from the ordinary laws which govern men. He is not liable for anything he may do.&quot;

After robbing Loeb&#x27;s old fraternity house at the University of Michigan, where they stole penknives, a camera, and a typewriter that they later used to type the ransom note for their murder victim, Bobby Franks, Loeb proposed they should commit a &quot;perfect crime&quot; that would garner public attention and confirm their superiority to others.

== Murder of Bobby Franks ==

Leopold and Loeb, who were 19 and 18, respectively, at the time, settled on kidnapping and murdering a younger adolescent as their perfect crime. They spent seven months planning everything, from the method of abduction to the disposal of the body. To obfuscate the actual nature of their crime and their motive for it, they decided to make a ransom demand, and they also devised an intricate plan for collecting the ransom, which involved a long series of complex instructions that would be communicated, one instruction at a time.

After a lengthy search for a suitable victim, mostly on the grounds of the Harvard School for Boys in the Kenwood area, the pair decided upon Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Franks, the 14-year-old son of wealthy Chicago watch manufacturer Jacob Franks. Bobby Franks was an across-the-street neighbor of Loeb&#x27;s who had played tennis at the Loeb residence several times.

On the afternoon of May 21, 1924, using an automobile that Leopold rented under the name Morton D. Ballard, they offered Franks a ride as he walked home from school. The boy initially refused, because his destination was less than two blocks away, but Loeb persuaded him to enter the car to discuss a tennis racket that he had been using. The precise sequence of the events that followed remains in dispute, but a preponderance of opinion placed Leopold behind the wheel of the car while Loeb sat in the back seat. Loeb struck Franks, who was sitting in front of him in the passenger seat, several times in the head with the handle-end of a chisel, then dragged him into the back seat and gagged him, where he died.

With the body on the floor of the back seat, out of view, the men drove to their predetermined dumping spot near Wolf Lake, in the extreme south side of Chicago. After nightfall, they removed Franks&#x27; clothes, then concealed the body in a culvert along the Pennsylvania Railroad tracks north of the lake. To obscure the body&#x27;s identity, they poured hydrochloric acid on the face and genitals to disguise the fact that he had been circumcised, as circumcision was unusual among non-Jews in the United States at the time.
By the time the two men returned to Chicago, word had already spread that Franks was missing. Leopold called Franks&#x27; mother, identifying himself as &quot;George Johnson,&quot; and told her that Franks had been kidnapped; instructions for delivering the ransom would follow. After mailing the typed ransom note and burning Franks&#x27; clothes, then cleaning the blood stains from the rented vehicle&#x27;s upholstery, they spent the remainder of the evening playing cards.

Once the Franks family received the ransom note on the following morning, Leopold called a second time and dictated the first set of instructions for the delivery of the ransom payment. The intricate plan was stalled almost immediately when Franks&#x27; father forgot the address of the store where he was supposed to receive the next set of directions, and it was abandoned entirely when word came the same day that Franks&#x27; body had been found by workmen along the railroad track. Leopold and Loeb destroyed the typewriter and they also burned a car robe (lap blanket) which they had used to move the body. They then went about their lives as usual.

Chicago police launched a thorough investigation; rewards were offered in exchange for information. Leopold and Loeb both enjoyed chatting about the murder with their friends and relatives. Leopold discussed the case with his professor and a female friend, joking that he would confess and give her the reward money. Loeb helped a couple of reporter friends of his find the drugstore he and Leopold had tried to send Mr. Franks to, and when asked to describe Bobby he replied: &quot;If I were to murder anybody, it would be just such a cocky little son of a bitch as Bobby Franks.&quot;

Police found a pair of eyeglasses near Franks&#x27; body. Although the prescription and the frame were common, they were fitted with an unusual hinge, which was only purchased by three customers in Chicago, one of whom was Leopold. When questioned, Leopold offered the possibility that his glasses might have dropped out of his pocket during a bird-watching trip the previous weekend. 

Leopold and Loeb were summoned for formal questioning on May 29. They asserted that on the night of the murder, they had picked up two women in Chicago using Leopold&#x27;s car, then dropped them off some time later near a golf course without learning their last names. Their alibi was exposed as a fabrication when Leopold&#x27;s chauffeur told police that he was repairing Leopold&#x27;s car while the men claimed to be using it. The chauffeur&#x27;s wife confirmed that the car was parked in the Leopold garage on the afternoon of the murder. The destroyed typewriter was recovered from the Jackson Park Lagoon on June 7.

=== Confession ===
Loeb was the first to confess. He asserted that Leopold had planned everything and had killed Franks in the backseat of the car while he (Loeb) drove. Leopold&#x27;s confession followed swiftly thereafter. He insisted that he was the driver and Loeb the murderer. Their confessions otherwise corroborated most of the evidence in the case. Both confessions were announced by the state&#x27;s attorney on May 31. 

Leopold later claimed, long after Loeb was dead, that he pleaded in vain with Loeb to admit to killing Franks. &quot;Mompsie feels less terrible than she might, thinking you did it,&quot; he quotes Loeb as saying, &quot;and I&#x27;m not going to take that shred of comfort away from her.&quot; Most observers believed that Loeb did strike the fatal blows. Some circumstantial evidence, including testimony from eyewitness Carl Ulvigh, who claimed that he saw Loeb driving and Leopold in the back seat minutes before the kidnapping, suggested that Leopold could have been the killer.

Both Leopold and Loeb admitted that they were driven by their thrill-seeking, &quot;Übermenschen&quot; (supermen) delusions, and their aspiration to commit a &quot;perfect crime&quot;. Neither claimed to have looked forward to the killing, but Leopold admitted interest in learning what it would feel like to be a murderer. He was disappointed to note that he felt the same as ever.

== Trial ==

The trial of Leopold and Loeb at Chicago&#x27;s Cook County Criminal Court became a media spectacle and the third to be labeled &quot;the trial of the century,&quot; after those of Harry Thaw and Sacco and Vanzetti. The Leopold and Loeb families hired the renowned criminal defense attorney Clarence Darrow to lead the defense team. It was rumored that Darrow was paid $1 million for his services, but he was actually paid $65,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Darrow took the case because he was a staunch opponent of capital punishment.

While it was generally assumed that the men&#x27;s defense would be based on a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, Darrow concluded that a jury trial would almost certainly end in conviction and the death penalty. Thus, he elected to enter a plea of guilty, hoping to convince Cook County Circuit Court Judge John R. Caverly to impose sentences of life imprisonment.

The trial, technically an extended sentencing hearing, as their guilty pleas had already been accepted, ran for 32 days. The state&#x27;s attorney, Robert E. Crowe, presented 88 witnesses, documenting details of the crime. The defense presented extensive psychiatric testimony in an effort to establish mitigating circumstances, including physical abnormalities, an over-abundance of money and, in Leopold&#x27;s case, sexual abuse by a governess. 

One piece of evidence was a letter written by Leopold claiming that he and Loeb were having a homosexual affair. Both the prosecution and the defense interpreted this information as supportive of their own position. Darrow called a series of expert witnesses, who offered a catalog of Leopold&#x27;s and Loeb&#x27;s abnormalities. One witness testified to their dysfunctional endocrine glands, another to the delusions that had led to their crime.

=== Darrow&#x27;s speech ===
Darrow&#x27;s impassioned, eight-hour-long &quot;masterful plea&quot; at the conclusion of the hearing has been called the finest speech of his career. Its principal arguments were that the methods and punishments of the American justice system were inhumane, and the youth and immaturity of the accused:
The judge was persuaded, but he explained in his ruling that his decision was based primarily on precedent and the youth of the accused. On September 10, 1924, he sentenced both Leopold and Loeb to life imprisonment for the murder, and an additional 99 years for the kidnapping. A little over a month later, Loeb&#x27;s father died of heart failure.

Darrow&#x27;s handling of the law as defense counsel has been criticized for hiding psychiatric expert testimony that conflicted with his polemical goals and for relying on an absolute denial of free will, one of the principles legitimizing all criminal punishment.

== Imprisonment ==

Leopold and Loeb were initially held in Joliet Prison and did menial labor, Leopold working in the prison&#x27;s rattan factory and Loeb in the chair factory. Although they were kept apart as much as possible, the two of them managed to maintain their friendship. Leopold was transferred to Stateville Penitentiary in 1925 for an appendectomy, where he worked in the shoe factory and then in the library as a clerk for the prison&#x27;s Protestant chaplain. He was caught violating prison rules and sent to solitary confinement many times, at one point possibly being involved in the escape of seven prisoners. In Joliet, Loeb worked in the yard delivering messages before being promoted to clerk for the deputy warden. He was transferred to Stateville in 1930, where he began to work in the prison&#x27;s greenhouse and landscaping the prison yard. Once Leopold and Loeb were in the same prison, the pair began to spend much of their time together. They did sociological research together and expanded the prison&#x27;s school system, adding a high school and junior college curriculum.

=== Loeb&#x27;s death ===
On January 28, 1936, Loeb was attacked with a straight razor in a shower room by his fellow inmate James Day; he died in the prison hospital soon afterward. Day claimed that Loeb had attempted to sexually assault him, but he was unharmed while Loeb sustained more than fifty wounds, including defensive wounds on his arms and hands. His throat had been slashed from behind. News accounts suggested that Loeb had propositioned Day; some praised Day for his actions. 

Though several prison officials including the Warden believed that Loeb had been murdered, Day was found not guilty by a jury after a short trial in June 1936. There is no evidence that Loeb was a sexual predator while in prison, but Day was later caught at least once in a sexual act with a fellow inmate. In his autobiography, &quot;Life Plus 99 Years&quot;, Leopold ridiculed Day&#x27;s claim that Loeb had attempted to sexually assault him. This was echoed by the prison&#x27;s Catholic chaplain, a confidant of Loeb&#x27;s, who said that it was more likely that Day attacked Loeb after Loeb rebuffed his advances.

Several weeks after the killing, Mark Hellinger wrote in his syndicated column, &quot;I must tell you of the line that came to me from an unknown correspondent in Chicago. This anonymous contributor said he had the absolute low-down on the recent slaying of Dickie Loeb. Seems that Loeb made a slight mistake in grammar. He ended a sentence in a proposition...&quot; While some sources state Ed Lahey had previously written in the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;, &quot;Richard Loeb, despite his erudition, today ended his sentence with a proposition&quot;, no evidence has been found that this was ever published, and actual copy from that date reads otherwise.

=== Leopold&#x27;s years in prison ===

Leopold continued his work expanding the school and teaching after Loeb&#x27;s death. In 1944, Leopold volunteered for the Stateville Penitentiary Malaria Study. He was deliberately inoculated with malaria pathogens and subjected to several experimental malaria treatments. He later wrote that all his good work in prison and after his release was an effort to compensate for his crime.

In the early 1950s, author Meyer Levin, a graduate of the University of Chicago, requested Leopold&#x27;s cooperation in the writing of a novel that was based on the murder of Franks. Leopold responded to Meyer Levin&#x27;s request by stating that he did not want his story to be told in a fictionalized form, but offered Levin a chance to contribute to his own memoir, which was in progress. Though the pair met to discuss the possibility, Leopold rejected Levin&#x27;s help and Levin went ahead with his book alone, despite Leopold&#x27;s express objections. The novel, titled &quot;Compulsion&quot;, was published in 1956. 

Levin portrayed Leopold, under the pseudonym Judd Steiner, as a brilliant but a deeply disturbed teenager, psychologically driven to kill because of his abnormal sexuality, troubled childhood and an obsession with Loeb. Leopold later wrote that reading Levin&#x27;s book made him &quot;physically sick... More than once I had to lay the book down and wait for the nausea to subside. I felt as I suppose a man would feel if he were exposed stark-naked under a strong spotlight before a large audience.&quot;

Leopold&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Life Plus 99 Years&quot;, was published in 1958 as part of his campaign to win parole. His book was on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for 14 weeks. While the book received generally positive reviews, some accused him of writing the book solely as a means of rehabilitating his public image by ignoring the dark side of his past.

== Leopold&#x27;s post-prison years ==

After 33 years and numerous unsuccessful petitions, Leopold was released on parole on March 13, 1958. The Brethren Service Commission, a Church of the Brethren-affiliated program, accepted him as a medical technician at its hospital in Puerto Rico. He expressed his appreciation in an article: &quot;To me the Brethren Service Commission offered the job, the home, and the sponsorship without which a man cannot be paroled. But it gave me so much more than thatthe companionship, the acceptance, the love which would have rendered a violation of parole almost impossible.&quot; He was known as &quot;Nate&quot; to neighbors and co-workers at Castañer General Hospital in Adjuntas, where he worked as a laboratory and X-ray assistant.

Later in 1958, Leopold attempted to set up the Leopold Foundation, to be funded by royalties from &quot;Life Plus 99 Years&quot;, &quot;to aid emotionally disturbed, retarded, or delinquent youths.&quot; The State of Illinois voided his charter on grounds that it violated the terms of his parole.

In 1959, Leopold sought to block production of the film version of &quot;Compulsion&quot; on the grounds that Levin&#x27;s book had invaded his privacy, defamed him, profited from his life story and &quot;intermingled fact and fiction to such an extent that they were indistinguishable.&quot; After 11 years and many appeals, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled against him, holding that Leopold, as the confessed perpetrator of the &quot;crime of the century,&quot; could not reasonably argue that any book had injured his reputation.

Leopold moved to Santurce and married a widowed florist, Gertrude (Feldman) García de Quevedo, on February 5, 1961. Judge Ángel M. Umpierre presided over the wedding at a civil ceremony, which was held at the Brethren Service Project in Castañer, Puerto Rico. Despite his marriage, Leopold had many gay relationships in Puerto Rico, some continuing from those which he started in prison, and he enjoyed frequenting gay bars and male prostitutes. He also continued to commit crimes, though he was never caught or prosecuted, including offenses of statutory rape and charity fraud.

Leopold earned a master&#x27;s degree at the University of Puerto Rico. He became a researcher in the Social Service Program of Puerto Rico&#x27;s Department of Health. He also worked for an urban renewal and housing agency, and he conducted studies on leprosy at the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine. 

Leopold was an active member of the Natural History Society of Puerto Rico, he traveled throughout the island to observe its birdlife. In 1963, he published &quot;Checklist of Birds of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands&quot;. While he spoke about his intention to write a book about his life since his release from prison, which he titled &quot;Reach for a Halo&quot;, he never completed it.

Leopold died of a diabetes-related heart attack on August 29, 1971, at the age of 66.

== In popular culture ==
The Franks murder has inspired works of film, theatre and fiction, including the 1929 play &quot;Rope&quot; by Patrick Hamilton and Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film of the same name in 1948. A fictionalized version of the events formed the basis of Meyer Levin&#x27;s 1956 novel &quot;Compulsion&quot; and its 1959 film adaptation. In 1957, two more fictionalizations were published: &quot;Nothing but the Night&quot; by James Yaffe and &quot;Little Brother Fate&quot; by Mary-Carter Roberts. &quot;Never the Sinner&quot;, John Logan&#x27;s 1985 play, was based on contemporary newspaper accounts of the case, and included an overt portrayal of Leopold and Loeb&#x27;s sexual relationship.

In his book &quot;Murder Most Queer&quot; (2014), theater scholar Jordan Schildcrout examines changing attitudes toward homosexuality in various theatrical and cinematic representations of the Leopold and Loeb case.

Other works said to be influenced by the case include Richard Wright&#x27;s 1940 novel &quot;Native Son&quot;, the &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;Columbo Goes to College&quot; (1990), Tom Kalin&#x27;s 1992 film &quot;Swoon&quot;, Michael Haneke&#x27;s 1997 Austrian film &quot;Funny Games&quot; and the 2008 International remake, Barbet Schroeder&#x27;s &quot;Murder by Numbers&quot; (2002), Daniel Clowes&#x27;s 2005 graphic novel &quot;Ice Haven&quot;, the &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; episode &quot;Big Murderer on Campus&quot;, Stephen Dolginoff&#x27;s 2005 off-Broadway musical &quot;Thrill Me: The Leopold and Loeb Story&quot;, Micah Nemerever&#x27;s &quot;These Violent Delights&quot; (2020)
and the Ghostface killers in &quot;Scream&quot; (1996).

In the WB series &quot;Riverdale&quot;, Archie is incarcerated in the &quot;Leopold &amp; Loeb Institute for Delinquent Youth.&quot;

Prior to becoming the Chief Creative Officer of Archie Comics, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa wrote an unauthorized play in which the fictional teenager Archie Andrews had a homosexual relationship with Nathan Leopold. Before it could open, Aguirre-Sacasa was forced to stop the production after being served a cease and desist from Archie comics. The production eventually opened under the name &quot;Weird Comic Book Fantasy&quot;.

In the season six episode titled &quot;Plan and Execution&quot; from American crime drama series &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;, Howard Hamlin accuses Saul Goodman and Kim Wexler of being like Leopold and Loeb due to them framing him as a drug addict for the sole purpose of their own enjoyment.

Leopold and Loeb are also referenced in the season four episode of Seinfeld titled ”The Junior Mint”. Jerry Seinfeld and Cosmo Kramer bickered over a Junior Mint while observing a surgery. The ensuing quarrel led to Seinfeld pushing a mint out of Kramer&#x27;s hands which landed in the person being operated on. The surgeons were oblivious to what had happened. The patient&#x27;s condition deteriorated after surgery. Fearing that the mint would kill the patient, Seinfeld wanted to come clean to the doctor. As Kramer resisted the idea, Seinfeld implied they&#x27;re both complicit by saying they&#x27;re like Leopold and Loeb.

<text>Earth Day is an annual event on April 22 to demonstrate support for environmental protection. First held on April 22, 1970, it now includes a wide range of events coordinated globally by EARTHDAY.ORG (formerly Earth Day Network) including 1 billion people in more than 193 countries.

In 1969 at a UNESCO Conference in San Francisco, peace activist John McConnell proposed a day to honor the Earth and the concept of peace, to first be observed on March 21, 1970, the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere. This day of nature&#x27;s equipoise was later sanctioned in a proclamation written by McConnell and signed by Secretary General U Thant at the United Nations. A month later, United States Senator Gaylord Nelson proposed the idea to hold a nationwide environmental teach-in on April 22, 1970. He hired a young activist, Denis Hayes, to be the National Coordinator. Nelson and Hayes renamed the event &quot;Earth Day&quot;. Denis and his staff grew the event beyond the original idea for a teach-in to include the entire United States. Key non-environmentally focused partners played major roles. Under the leadership of labor leader Walter Reuther, for example, the United Auto Workers (UAW) was the most instrumental outside financial and operational supporter of the first Earth Day. According to Hayes: &quot;Without the UAW, the first Earth Day would have likely flopped!&quot; Nelson was later awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom award in recognition of his work. 
The first Earth Day was focused on the United States. In 1990, Denis Hayes, the original national coordinator in 1970, took it international and organized events in 141 nations. On Earth Day 2016, the landmark Paris Agreement was signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and 120 other countries. This signing satisfied a key requirement for the entry into force of the historic draft climate protection treaty adopted by consensus of the 195 nations present at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. Numerous communities engaged in Earth Day Week actions, an entire week of activities focused on the environmental issues that the world faces. On Earth Day 2020, over 100 million people around the world observed the 50th anniversary in what is being referred to as the largest online mass mobilization in history.

==1969 Santa Barbara Oil Spill==
On January 28, 1969, a well called Platform A, drilled by Union Oil off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, blew out. More than of oil spilled, killing more than 10,000 seabirds, dolphins, seals, and sea lions. As a reaction to this disaster, activists were mobilized to create environmental regulation, environmental education, and Earth Day. Among the proponents of Earth Day were the people in the front lines of fighting this disaster, Selma Rubin, Marc McGinnes, and Bud Bottoms, founder of Get Oil Out. Denis Hayes, organizer of the first Earth Day, said that Senator Gaylord Nelson from Wisconsin was inspired to create Earth Day upon seeing an oil slick from an airplane in the Santa Barbara Channel.

==Santa Barbara&#x27;s Environmental Rights Day 1970==
On the first anniversary of the oil blowout, January 28, 1970, Environmental Rights Day was created, and the Declaration of Environmental Rights was read. It had been written by Rod Nash during a boat trip across the Santa Barbara Channel while carrying a copy of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Declaration of Independence. The organizers of Environmental Rights Day, led by Marc McGinnes, had been working closely over a period of several months with Congressman Pete McCloskey (R-CA) to consult on the creation of the National Environmental Policy Act, the first of many new environmental protection laws sparked by the national outcry about the blowout/oil spill and on the Declaration of Environmental Rights. Both McCloskey (Earth Day co-chair with Senator Gaylord Nelson) and Earth Day organizer Denis Hayes, along with Senator Alan Cranston, Paul Ehrlich, David Brower and other prominent leaders, endorsed the Declaration and spoke about it at the Environmental Rights Day conference. According to Francis Sarguis, &quot;the conference was sort of like the baptism for the movement.&quot; According to Hayes, this was the first giant crowd he spoke to that &quot;felt passionately, I mean really passionately, about environmental issues.&quot; Hayes also thought the conference might be the beginning of a real movement. Nash, Garrett Hardin, McGinnes and others went on to develop the first undergraduate Environmental Studies program of its kind at the University of California at Santa Barbara.

==Earth Day 1970==
The seeds that grew into the first Earth Day were planted by Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson. An ardent conservationist and former two-term governor of Wisconsin, Nelson had long sought ways to increase the potency of the environment as a political issue. The extraordinary attention garnered by Rachel Carson&#x27;s 1962 book, &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, the famous 1968 &quot;Earthrise&quot; NASA photograph of the Earth from the Moon, the saturation news coverage given to the Santa Barbara oil spill and the Cuyahoga River catching fire in early 1969 led Nelson to think the time was ripe for an environmental initiative. As a result of interactions with his staff and with Fred Dutton, a prominent Democratic operative who had been Robert Kennedy&#x27;s presidential campaign manager, Nelson became convinced that environmental teach-ins on college campuses could serve as such a vehicle.

Teach-ins had been held on hundreds of college campuses to debate the war in Vietnam. They generally reflected the divide between those who thought of Vietnam as a bulwark to stop additional countries falling to communism like dominos, versus those who believed that the war was the latest stage of a nationalist, anti-colonialist campaign by Vietnamese who had fought against China, then France, Japan, France again, and now the United States. These debates elevated arguments over the war in the public consciousness and enlisted a generation of student activists.

Nelson asked public interest lawyer Anthony Roisman to establish a non-profit, Environmental Teach-In, Inc., to manage the campaign, and recruited a small board of directors. He asked Republican Congressman Pete McCloskey to co-chair the board to ensure it was bipartisan and bicameral.

On September 20, 1969, Senator Nelson first announced his plans for an &quot;environmental teach-In&quot; in a little-publicized talk at the University of Washington. &quot;I am convinced that the same concern the youth of this nation took in changing this nation&#x27;s priorities on the war in Vietnam and on civil rights can be shown for the problem of the environment. That is why I plan to see to it that a national teach-in is held.&quot;

Senator Nelson went on to encourage teach-ins at many more speeches. A November talk at Airlie House had a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter in the audience. The resulting front-page article was a turning point. Letters of inquiry from across the country began to pour into Nelson&#x27;s Senate office. The article piqued the interest of Denis Hayes, then a graduate student at Harvard. Hayes traveled to Washington, D.C., and arranged a 10-minute visit with Senator Nelson (which stretched into two hours). Hayes returned to Harvard with the charter to organize Boston. After a few days of reference checks, he was asked to drop out of Harvard to become executive director of the national campaign.

Because of the non-hierarchical tenor of the times, Hayes suggested that people be designated coordinators rather than directors. He became the national coordinator, and he quickly hired various regional coordinators, a press coordinator, a K–12 coordinator, a volunteer coordinator, etc. At its peak, the national office had a few dozen paid staff, each earning a flat $375/month (), plus more than 100 regular volunteers.

As the talented regional coordinators fanned out across the country, however, they immediately encountered two problems. First, by 1970, the concept of &quot;teach-ins&quot; had become passé. Moreover, teach-ins generally involved debates, and no one was pro-pollution. Second, and more troubling, leading activists on college campuses were deeply involved in the anti-war and civil rights movements. They tended to view the environment as a distraction.

=== The &quot;Earth Day&quot; name ===
The solution to the first problem came from an unexpected direction. Shortly after the turn of the year, Julien Koenig stopped by the national offices and volunteered to help. Koenig was a Madison Avenue giant. His campaign for Volkswagen, &quot;Think Small,&quot; was later cited by Advertising Age as the &quot;greatest advertising campaign of the 20th century.&quot;

Over coffee, Hayes confided that the &quot;teach-in&quot; moniker was not working and asked whether Koenig had any ideas. Koenig asked for a few days. A week later, he returned with an assortment of mock-ups for ads, laid out around the announcement of &quot;Ecology Day,&quot; &quot;Environment Day,&quot; &quot;Earth Day,&quot; and &quot;E Day.&quot; Koenig said that his personal favorite was Earth Day – in part because April 22 happened to be his birthday, and &quot;birthday&quot; rhymes with &quot;Earth Day.&quot; Hayes immediately agreed. Koenig offered to prepare a fully refined ad. Hayes insisted that it include a small coupon soliciting funds for the threadbare operation. Koenig&#x27;s ad was visually arresting, and perfectly summed up the issues and values, the feisty-but-welcoming tone that the campaign had adopted. Hayes loved it and decided to bet the farm. He committed about half of all the money in the campaign&#x27;s bank account to buy a full page in the &quot;Sunday New York Times&quot; opinion section.

The ad was a huge success. Overnight, &quot;Earth Day&quot; became the almost-universally-used name for the upcoming event. The ad generated more than enough revenue to repay its cost, and thousands of potential organizers sent in their names and addresses along with their checks. In future months, magazines and alternative newspapers ran the ad for free, generating still more names and more financial support. The national office started using Environmental Action, rather than Environmental Teach-in, on its letterhead and publications to promote Earth Day.
At this point, Hayes made a far-reaching decision. In those early days, it would have been easy to obtain trademark protection for Earth Day and force compliance with a set of standards by anyone using it. Hayes decided, however, that he wanted the name to be broadly used by anyone who planned to focus on environmental issues that spring.

Although &quot;Earth Day&quot; swiftly replaced Environmental Teach-in, the second problem proved more complicated. College activists, for the most part, viewed anything other than ending the war as a distraction. A majority of the Earth Day staff had cut their teeth as organizers against the war and saw no conflict. The war appeared to be winding down, and they felt it was prudent to start paying attention to the far more profound changes needed to produce a healthy, sustainable America. But time was short, and college activists were not responding.

Hayes spent a day reviewing the letters Senator Nelson had received, and discovered that very few were from college students. Most were from women who appeared to be college-educated homemakers who wanted to do something to improve the world for their children. Another large share was from K–12 teachers.

Hayes decided to shift the campaign&#x27;s focus from colleges and universities to community organizing. Building off the successful strategies of the anti-war movement and the civil rights movement, he decided to promote large urban rallies, focused on major environmental issues, while also encouraging environmental education at the K–12 level.

Bryce Hamilton, who had been Midwest coordinator, was shifted to K–12 coordinator, and it proved to be a great choice. Hamilton reached out to the National Education Association, American Federation of Teachers, and the National Science Teachers Association to enlist their members; he provided materials to thousands of educators who wrote to the group directly; and he distributed the most creative ideas he received from anyone to everyone else. In April, more than 10,000 primary and secondary schools engaged in Earth Day activities, mostly education and service actions like beach clean-ups, tree planting, and recycling.

Walt Kelly created an anti-pollution poster featuring his comic strip character Pogo with the quotation &quot;We have met the enemy and he is us&quot; to promote the 1970 Earth Day. Environmental groups have sought to make Earth Day into a day of action to change human behavior and provoke policy changes.

On the first Earth Day an estimated 20 million Americans took part in rallies, marches, and teach-ins calling for environmental reform. Earth Day is now observed in 192 countries, and coordinated by the nonprofit Earthday.org (formerly Earth Day Network). According to Denis Hayes, the first Earth Day 1970 organizer and current Board Chair Emeritus of Earthday.org, Earth Day is now &quot;the largest secular day of protest in the world, and more than a billion people participate in Earth Day actions every year.&quot;

By far the largest source of funding for the first Earth Day was organized labor. Walter Reuther had led the United Auto Workers (UAW) since 1946, and he was a progressive supporter of civil rights, opposed the war, and championed the environment. He was a founding member of the Coalition for Clean Air, which successfully lobbied for the Clean Air Act of 1970. Walter Reuther, president of the United Auto Workers, made the first donation to support the first Earth Day in the amount of $2,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Under his leadership, the UAW also funded telephone capabilities so that the organizers could communicate and coordinate with each other from all across the United States. The UAW also financed, printed, and mailed all of the literature and other materials for the first Earth Day and mobilized its members to participate in the public demonstrations across the country. According to Denis Hayes, &quot;The UAW was by far the largest contributor to the first Earth Day&quot; and &quot;Without the UAW, the first Earth Day would have likely flopped!&quot; Hayes further said, &quot;Walter&#x27;s presence at our first press conference utterly changed the dynamics of the coverage—we had instant credibility.&quot;

At a meeting of the Environmental Teach-In board of directors, the finance committee chair arrived with a check for $20,000 (equivalent to $ in ) from Standard Oil of New Jersey (now ExxonMobil). That would have provided an effective measure of financial relief for the financially strapped group. But Hayes declined the check, convincing the board that it would destroy the credibility of the nascent organization. He said that he would be delighted to accept money from clean sources, but no other corporate money was ever raised for the national organization.

Individual donations were a significant source of funding, generally accompanied by a contribution slip from the Earth Day Ad providing the donor&#x27;s name and address. Larry Rockefeller persuaded Robert Rauschenberg to create and donate a batch of Earth Day lithographs, but the Earth Day staff lacked contacts in the art world who were able to sell them for their $2,000 market value, so they were provided to donors for much less.

The sale of standard posters and especially pins brought in additional revenue. The staff refused to sell bumper strips because they would be attached to cars.

=== The Dirty Dozen ===
The staff of Environmental Teach-In resigned immediately after Earth Day, and most moved directly to a new organization, Environmental Action, with a tax status that permitted lobbying and a more activist stance. EA immediately confronted a problem that had been looming in the background throughout the campaign. Some of the staff had been drawn to the movement through science and culture and felt that politics was inherently dirty and government was irredeemably compromised. This group believed that by living lives of voluntary simplicity, employing tools like those that filled the resolutely-nonpolitical &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot;, they could force the world to adapt to them. Their theory of change was modeled loosely on the southern African Americans who sat at segregated lunch counters, drank from segregated lunch counters, and sat in the front of the bus, it ignored the role of strategic litigation federal legislation, and electoral politics in cementing lasting change.

Other staff members had worked in the Robert Kennedy, Gene McCarthy, and various congressional campaigns before Earth Day. They believed that lasting progress could only come through institutional change. The year 1970 was a congressional election year. They had just organized the largest demonstration in the nation&#x27;s history to support environmental values. Former Lindsay organizer, Steve Haft, summed up this faction&#x27;s attitude at an Environmental Action staff meeting, &quot;We had 20 million people in the streets in an election year, and you plan to sit out the election? Are you nuts?&quot;

To square the circle, Hayes proposed that the group not endorse any candidates but that it try to defeat 12 of the worst. If having a terrible environmental record became a political liability, it would inevitably lead to better environmental legislation. Haft was selected to coordinate the Dirty Dozen campaign. With just $50,000 to defeat 12 incumbent members of the House, the odds were long.

To improve the odds, the group selected candidates who not only had lousy environmental records—which were plentiful—but who also had won their most recent race by a narrow margin; who were on the wrong side of an important environmental issue in their districts; and who lived in areas where talented Earth Day organizers resided. In the end, seven of the original Dirty Dozen were defeated—five Republicans and two Democrats. And the first to fall was George Fallon, chairman of the hugely powerful House Public Works Committee.

Representative Pete McCloskey, Earth Day co-chair, credits the Dirty Dozen&#x27;s defeat of key congressional leaders with the unstoppable wave of environmental legislation that immediately followed: the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, and others.

=== The University of Michigan teach-in ===
As the tone of major planned Earth Day activities shifted to become less academic and more confrontational, and the Environmental Action newsletter emphasized the need for broad structural change, interest in the event began to mount among college student activists.

One place where the interest in a teach-in was robust from the beginning was the University of Michigan. The first teach-in on the Vietnam War had been held at the University of Michigan in March 1965, and a group of students, led by Doug Scott, decided to mark the five-year anniversary with an environmental teach-in on March 11–14, 1970. The Michigan teach-in presented a series of speeches dealing with various environmental problems, along with some debate over the best tactics and solutions. No one, including the president of Dow Chemical, argued for more environmental destruction.

After the University of Michigan teach-in, there was an explosion of interest on other college campuses. Upwards of 2,000 universities, colleges, and junior colleges ultimately put on events. By the end, the national staff had a hard time merely keeping up with the colleges that called to register events.

=== The focus on pollution ===
The delicate line straddled by organizers was to attract seasoned activists who would demand far-reaching change without alienating the middle class whose active participation and political support were seen as essential. The greatest environmental insults were visited on the poor. Factories and power plants were located in the poorest neighborhoods. Freeways were plowed through the poorest neighborhoods. Toxic waste dumps were situated in the poorest neighborhoods. But these problems tended not to affect the middle class.

The solution was to promote an overarching concern with air and water pollution, which affected everyone, while encouraging each community to pay attention to whatever other issues were of most concern to it. Earth Day included events that focused on fighting freeways, protecting the ozone layer, organic food, whales and endangered species, oil spills, the military use of Agent Orange in Vietnam, overpopulation, peeling lead paint in ghetto housing, opposition to the supersonic transport, and myriad other topics. At one event, college students would pound an automobile apart with sledgehammers, or, wearing gas masks, would block traffic on a freeway. At other events, grade-school students would plant trees, pick up litter in city parks, or identify birds. Earth Day welcomed them all.

Regional coordinators focused heavily on finding and enlisting the best local leadership in major metropolitan areas. For instance, Hayes flew to Chicago to help organize a subtle coup, replacing a pro-business Earth Day organization with a Saul Alinsky affiliated group called Campaign Against Pollution. CAP abruptly shifted the focus away from recycling to focus on two issues: opposition to a massive proposed freeway program, the Crosstown Expressway, and protesting the uncontrolled air pollution Commonwealth Edison was pouring into Chicago&#x27;s air—more sulfur pollution than all other companies combined. Although mailings went out to thousands of communities of all sizes, the campaign focused especially hard on large cities.

===New York City===
In the winter of 1969–1970, a group of students met at Columbia University to hear Denis Hayes talk about his plans for Earth Day. Among the group were Fred Kent, Pete Grannis, and Kristin and William Hubbard. This group agreed to head up the New York City activities within the national movement. Fred Kent took the lead in renting an office and recruiting volunteers. The liberal Republican mayor of New York, John Lindsay, saw the environment as an issue that could help unite his then-troubled city. Moreover, he viewed the environment as a progressive wedge issue that would position him as clearly distinct from President Nixon&#x27;s ultra-conservative &quot;Southern Strategy,&quot; in a struggle for the soul of the Republican Party. He became fully engaged in supporting the event, and he delegated many of the talented young staff who had been drawn to his administration to help as well. 
&quot;The big break came when Mayor Lindsay agreed to shut down Fifth Avenue for the event. A giant cheer went up in the office on that day,&quot; according to Kristin Hubbard (now Kristin Alexandre). &quot;From that time on we used Mayor Lindsay&#x27;s offices and even his staff. I was Speaker Coordinator but had tremendous help from Lindsay staffer Judith Crichton.&quot; Mayor Lindsay completely closed down Fifth Avenue to traffic from E. 14th Street to West 59th Street (Central Park)—more than 2 miles—and 14th Street between 3rd and 7th Avenues. An estimated one million participants took part—right in the nerve center of the nation&#x27;s communications complex.

In addition to shutting down Fifth Avenue, Mayor John Lindsay made Central Park available for Earth Day. In Union Square, the &quot;New York Times&quot; estimated crowds of up to 20,000 people at any given time and, perhaps, more than 100,000 over the course of the day. Since Manhattan was also the home of NBC, CBS, ABC, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;Newsweek&quot;, it provided the best possible anchor for national coverage from their reporters throughout the country.

===Philadelphia===
U.S. Senator Edmund Muskie was the keynote speaker on Earth Day in Fairmount Park in Philadelphia. Other notable attendees included consumer protection activist and presidential candidate Ralph Nader, landscape architect Ian McHarg, Nobel prize-winning Harvard biochemist George Wald, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott, and poet Allen Ginsberg.

== Earth Day 1980 ==
The 1970s were a period of substantial environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, Superfund, Toxics Substances Control Act, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. It had seen the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency and the banning of DDT and of lead in gasoline. Jimmy Carter was president.

The 1980 Earth Day effort was led by Mike McCabe and Byron Kennard, and the general mood was festive and celebratory. The principal Washington, D.C., event was a festival held in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House.

== Earth Day 1990 to 1999 ==
Mobilizing 200 million people in 141 countries and lifting the status of environmental issues onto the world stage, Earth Day activities in 1990 gave a huge boost to recycling efforts worldwide and helped pave the way for the 1992 United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Unlike the first Earth Day in 1970, this 20th Anniversary was waged with stronger marketing tools, greater access to television and radio, and multimillion-dollar budgets.
Two separate groups formed to sponsor Earth Day events in 1990: The Earth Day 20 Foundation, assembled by Edward Furia (Project Director of Earth Week in 1970), and Earth Day 1990, assembled by Denis Hayes (National Coordinator for Earth Day 1970). Senator Gaylord Nelson, the original founder of Earth Day, was honorary chairman for both groups. The two did not combine forces over disagreements about leadership of combined organization and incompatible structures and strategies. Among the disagreements, key Earth Day 20 Foundation organizers were critical of Earth Day 1990 for including on their board Hewlett-Packard, a company that at the time was the second-biggest emitter of chlorofluorocarbons in Silicon Valley and refused to switch to alternative solvents. In terms of marketing, Earth Day 20 had a grassroots approach to organizing and relied largely on locally based groups like the National Toxics Campaign, a Boston-based coalition of 1,000 local groups concerned with industrial pollution. Earth Day 1990 employed strategies including focus group testing, direct mail fundraising, and email marketing.

The Earth Day 20 Foundation highlighted its April 22 activities in George, Washington, near the Columbia River with a live satellite phone call with members of the historic Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb who called from their base camp on Mount Everest to pledge their support for world peace and attention to environmental issues. The Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb was led by Jim Whittaker, the first American to summit Mt. Everest (many years earlier), and marked the first time in history that mountaineers from the United States, Soviet Union, and China had roped together to climb a mountain, let alone Mt. Everest. The group also collected more than two tons of trash (transported down the mountain by support groups along the way) that was left behind on Mount Everest from previous climbing expeditions. The master of ceremonies for the Columbia Gorge event was the TV star, John Ratzenberger, from &quot;Cheers&quot;, and the headlining musician was the &quot;Father of Rock and Roll&quot;, Chuck Berry.

Warner Bros. Records released an Earth Day-themed single in 1990 entitled &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;, written by Kix Brooks (who would later become one-half of Brooks &amp; Dunn) and Pam Tillis. The song featured vocals from Lynn Anderson, Butch Baker, Shane Barmby, Billy Hill, Suzy Bogguss, Kix Brooks, T. Graham Brown, The Burch Sisters, Holly Dunn, Foster &amp; Lloyd, Vince Gill, William Lee Golden, Highway 101, Shelby Lynne, Johnny Rodriguez, Dan Seals, Les Taylor, Pam Tillis, Mac Wiseman, and Kevin Welch. It charted at number 74 on the Hot Country Songs chart dated May 5, 1990.

== Earth Day 2000–2019 ==
=== Earth Day 2000 ===
As the millennium approached, Hayes agreed to spearhead another campaign, this time focusing on global warming and pushing for clean energy. The April 22 Earth Day in 2000 combined the big-picture feistiness of the first Earth Day with the international grassroots activism of Earth Day 1990. For 2000, Earth Day had the internet to help link activists around the world. By the time April 22 came around, 5,000 environmental groups worldwide were on board, reaching out to hundreds of millions of people in a record 184 countries. Events varied: A talking drum chain traveled from village to village in Gabon, Africa, for example, while hundreds of thousands of people gathered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., US.

=== Earth Day 2001 ===
Google&#x27;s first Earth Day doodle was in 2001.

=== Earth Day 2003 ===
The theme for Earth Day 2003 was the Water for Life Campaign. This year, Earth Day Network developed a water quality project called &quot;What&#x27;s in Your Water?&quot; Water-related events were held on every continent, including water workshops, exhibitions, concerts, and more in Togo, Egypt, the Cook Islands, Jordan, Palestine, Japan, Venezuela, Slovenia, Nigeria, and Canada. Educational curricula, teacher&#x27;s guides, water testing kits, and posters focused on water.

Campaign for Communities, an initiative led by NAACP, Latino organizations including Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project, and other organizations focused on environmental justice, created events focused on low-income communities around the U.S. These events were also focused on building support among low-income communities through clean-ups, park revitalization, and town halls focused on integrating the environmental movement with community and social justice causes.

=== Earth Day 2004 ===
In the U.S. in 2004, Earth Day Network and its partners focused on voter registration for Earth Day, registering hundreds of thousands of voters. Major tree planting events also took place. Other prominent U.S. Earth Day events included an annual cleanup in Dayton, Ohio and the &quot;3rd Annual Community Based Solutions to Environmental Health &amp; Justice Conference&quot; in Seattle, Washington.

=== Earth Day 2005 ===
The theme for Earth Day 2005 was Healthy Environments for Children.

=== Earth Day 2006 ===
Earth Day 2006 focused on science and faith. Earth Day expanded into Europe for Earth Day 2006, and events and speeches were held in most of the EU countries. Key events included the &quot;Festival on Climate Change&quot; in Utrecht, the Netherlands, which was focused on &quot;How to break away from the oil dependence,&quot; and included Earth Day founder Denis Hayes and members of the Dutch and E.U. parliament, NGOs, local authorities, and media representatives. In the first of two years of Earth Day events in Ukraine, Denis Hayes also attended and spoke at the &quot;Chernobyl 20 Remembrance for the Future&quot; conference in Kyiv, Ukraine. 2006 also saw events in China organized between Earth Day Network and Global Village Beijing educating communities about energy savings, the first-ever coordinated Earth Day events in Moscow, Russia, a scientific panel and a religious response panel on climate change throughout the U.S., and a &quot;Conserve Your Energy&quot; event in Philadelphia.

=== Earth Day 2007 ===
Thousands of Earth Day projects were held across the globe that ranged from energy efficiency events, protests, letter writing campaigns, civic and environmental K–12 education trainings, urban and rural cleanups, and water projects with a particular focus on building a broader and more diverse environmental movement. Major events took place in Kyiv, Ukraine; Caracas, Venezuela; Tuvalu; Philippines; Togo; and Madrid, Spain.

In the US, civil rights, religious, and social justice leaders joined Earth Day Network the week of April 16 through April 20 to demand Congress on behalf of their communities and their constituencies that there be no &quot;grandfathering&quot; of pollution permits, that an immediate reduction in carbon emissions be imposed through legislation and that all revenues generated from a carbon tax or a government auction of carbon permits be used for public benefit. Earth Day Network partnered with Green Apple Music &amp; Arts Festival to mark Earth Day with weekend-long events featuring music and entertainment in New York, San Francisco, and Chicago. More than 200,000 people attended the events and millions of people were reached through the media.

The &quot;Global Warming in the Pulpit Pledge campaign&quot; which mobilized priests, ministers, rabbis, and other faith leaders across the U.S. and Canada to make a commitment to preach on global climate change as a moral issue was launched. Later in 2007, Live Earth, a global music event, was held across the world.

=== Earth Day 2008 ===
Earth Day 2008 galvanized millions of people around the world in a Call For Climate. In the U.S., the campaign challenged the public to make one million calls to Congress about pushing for climate change legislation. 2008 also included large climate rallies in eight major U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., New York, Miami, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, to which around 350,000 people attended. Washington, D.C., hosted actor Edward Norton, Thomas Friedman of the New York Times, and James Hansen of NASA to deliver a strong global warming message and call for tough and fair climate action by Congress. O.A.R., Umphrey&#x27;s McGee, Warren Haynes, Mambo Sauce, and Blake Lewis of American Idol entertained enthusiastic crowds, and the event was covered live by CNN and The Weather Channel, plus scores of other media that carried the Call for Climate message. Many Earth Day events were held around the world from the Earth Day on Campus campaign.

=== Earth Day 2009 ===
The 2009 National Teach-In on Global Warming Solutions reached college campuses, civic organizations, and faith groups across the U.S. As part of this event, members of Congress addressed college and high school campuses in their districts via video conference.

=== Earth Day 2010 (40th anniversary) ===
An estimated one billion people around the world took action for the 40th anniversary of Earth Day. An estimated 20,000 partners took action on climate change and other environmental issues through climate rallies, Billion Acts of Green™, and by engaging civil leaders in plans to build a green economy, connected through the online action center at Earthday.org. Through the Global Day of Conversation, more than 200 elected officials in more than 39 countries took part in active dialogues with their constituents about their efforts to create sustainable green economies and reduce their carbon footprints. Students around the world participated in school greenings, featuring community clean-ups, solar energy systems, school gardens, and environmental curriculum. Earth Day Network announced a partnership with Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment&#x27;s Avatar Home Tree Initiative to plant one million trees in 15 countries by the end of 2010.

The Climate Rally on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., drew in more than 150,000 activists to demand that U.S. Congress pass comprehensive climate legislation in 2010. The nine-hour event featured more than 70 high-profile speakers, including leadership from the faith, labor, civil rights, environmental communities, the private sector, leading climate scientists, celebrities, Cabinet Secretaries, international political leaders, and local government officials.

In partnership with the Peace Corps, Earth Day Network worked with local volunteers to implement environmental and civic education programs, tree plantings, village clean-ups, and recycling seminars in rural areas in Ukraine, the Philippines, Georgia, Albania, and Kolkata, India. In 2010, Earth Day Network also established a satellite office in Kolkata, India.

As part of a nationwide commemoration of the 40th anniversary in Morocco, the government announced a unique National Charter for the Environment and Sustainable Development, the first commitment of its kind in Africa and the Arab world, which will inform new environmental laws for the country. The Kingdom of Morocco also pledged to plant one million trees.

Internationally, a new episode from season 7 of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; aired, by the name of &quot;SpongeBob&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;.

=== Earth Day 2011 ===
2011 Earth Day events included an environmental forum for local political leaders and the first-ever Earth Day celebration in Tunis City and primary school events throughout Iraq. In 17 of the world&#x27;s most severely deforested countries, Earth Day Network completed a project to plant over 1.1 million trees. Across the globe, more than 100 million Billion Acts of Green were registered. In September 2011, at the Clinton Global Initiative, President Clinton recognized this project as an exemplary approach to addressing global challenges.

=== Earth Day 2012 ===
A Billion Acts of Green were achieved on Earth Day 2012, with Earth Day Network announcing the accomplishment at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio. A Billion Acts of Green is billed as the world&#x27;s largest environmental service campaign, inspiring and rewarding both simple individual acts and larger organizational initiatives that further the goal of measurably reducing carbon emissions and supporting sustainability.
 The Campaign for Communities engaged elected officials in finding solutions to local environmental challenges. Faith programs saw Catholic parishes and churches across the U.S. take action on Earth Day through sermons and other activities, including four events at the National Cathedral and a conference at the St. Sophia Cathedral and National Religious Coalition on Creation Care (NRCC). Mobilize the Earth™ events throughout all of India&#x27;s states and geographic regions, coordinated by Earth Day Network India, included rallies, concerts, competitions, seminars, art shows, plantation drives, signature campaigns, and workshops.

=== Earth Day 2013 ===
The goal of Earth Day 2013 was to personalize the massive challenge that climate change presents while uniting people around the globe into a powerful call to action with the theme: The Face of Climate Change. To illustrate that climate change is not a remote problem for our leaders but is impacting real people, animals, and places everywhere, EDN collected images sent into #faceofclimate and displayed them in a collage at thousands of events around the world from schools to parks to government buildings. High level organizations and individuals participated in the campaign, including the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, US Secretary of State, and many more.

Meanwhile, stories of hope inspired communities to take action and MobilizeU, a program to educate and activate college students around Earth Day and environmental issues, expanded in 2013 to 296 universities in 51 countries on six continents and in 46 US states.

In Washington, D.C., EDN presented Earth Month at Union Station, a four-week series of events that featured an environmental film festival, renewable energy demonstrations, farmers markets, NASA educational exhibits, and public talks by scientists and astronauts. In partnership with Washington, D.C. Public Schools, EDN also presented a STEM Fair at Union Station.

=== Earth Day 2014 ===
The goal of Earth Day 2014 was to dramatically personalize the massive challenges surrounding global climate change and weave that into both Earth Day 2014 and the five-year countdown to Earth Day 2020, the 50th anniversary. It was an opportunity to unite people worldwide into a common cause and call for action.

The theme of Earth Day 2014 was Green Cities. Earth Day Network launched the Green Cities campaign in the fall of 2013 to help cities worldwide become more sustainable and reduce their carbon footprint. Focused on three key elements – buildings, energy, and transportation – the campaign aims to help cities accelerate their transition to a cleaner, healthier, and more economically viable future through improvements in efficiency, investments in renewable technology, and regulation reform.

=== Earth Day 2015 ===
To recognize the 45th anniversary of Earth Day, the 2015 global theme was termed &quot;It&#x27;s Our Turn to Lead.&quot;

That year, Earth Day was a part of the steady drumbeat towards Paris for the UNFCCC COP 21 climate talks that December. With a binding treaty on climate change expected from this conference, this is a pivotal year for the environmental movement. Earth Day Network&#x27;s (EDN) campaigns focused on instigating environmental advocacy, as well as strengthening climate communication and education.
EDN designed and executed four campaigns for its major constituencies: Green Cities, MobilizeU, Climate Education Week, and Faith Mobilization, all of which concentrated on the organization&#x27;s theme: &quot;It&#x27;s Our Turn to Lead&quot;.
In addition, EDN hosted Global Citizen 2015 Earth Day, in partnership with Global Poverty Project (GPP) on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. This venue allowed EDN and GPP to inspire and activate a new generation of global activists. The event worked to establish the intersection between eradicating global poverty and stopping climate change. Earth Day Network worked directly with major partners to garner large-scale commitments to stop climate change.

=== Earth Day 2016 ===
The theme for Earth Day 2016 was Trees for Earth. India, the Caribbean, Vietnam, and Morocco made substantial government commitments. The Black Lives Matter organization, which was created in 2013, also engaged with EarthDay.org in community panels. Close to 700 million community members, organizations, and school children took part in Earth Day 2016. Over 36 million trees were planted in India. &quot;Earth Day Network&quot; (now EarthDay.org) was accepted as an entry on Baidu Baike, a major online cyclopedia in China.

Hundreds of mayors across the world participated in Earth Day 2016 primarily focused on urban planning and reforestation.

=== Signing of the Paris Agreement at the UN ===
It was no accident that the United Nations selected Earth Day to sign the most significant climate accord in the history of the climate movement. On Earth Day 2016, world leaders from 175 nations broke a record by doing exactly that.

=== Earth Day 2017 ===
For Earth Day 2017, Earth Day Network launched the goal of global environmental and climate literacy by 2020. EDN envisioned a world that is fluent in the concepts of climate change and aware of its unprecedented threat to our planet. Environmental and climate literacy is the engine not only for creating green voters and advancing environmental and climate laws and policies but also for accelerating green technologies and jobs.

To that end, the 2017 Earth Day theme is environmental and climate education. EDN knows that education is the foundation for progress. Before we can solve the dire environmental threats facing us in the 21st century, we must build a global citizenry knowledgeable in environmental science and fluent in local and global ecological issues. A world with a more educated populace internalizes values – such as environmental protection – and is empowered to act in defense of these values.

To support this Earth Day theme, EDN promoted teach-ins as an activity to educate communities on global environmental issues and how global environmental issues impact local communities. EDN teach-ins strove to empower attendees with real, tangible actions they could take for the environment.

EDN developed an extensive global outreach strategy to promote Earth Day and assist organizations with producing a variety of actions, including teach-ins, in their own communities. Staff sent thousands of emails and made hundreds of phone calls, and revamped the organization&#x27;s social media. Additionally, EDN created five teach-in toolkits, with accompanying translations in four languages, to help constituencies organize and mobilize their communities.

Finally, EDN hosted the flagship March for Science march, rally, and teach-ins on Earth Day on the Washington Monument Grounds in Washington D.C. This event rallied and empowered attendees to support science and evidence-based policy. Approximately 100,000 people attended.

=== Earth Day 2018 ===
Earth Day 2018&#x27;s theme, End plastic pollution, was dedicated to building a world of educated citizens who understand the environmental, climate, and health consequences of using plastic. Through an online Plastics Pollution Calculator, consumers calculated how much disposable plastic they used in a year and planned how to reduce this amount of waste. A Plastic Pollution Primer and Action Toolkit also educated consumers about actions to reduce their plastic footprint. Events worldwide in The Gambia, Italy, Thailand, Japan, India, the U.S., among others, included plastic cleanups, teach-ins, and festivals in which 10,000 partners participated. In April 2018, the Google search for &quot;Plastic Pollution&quot; saw the highest trends in the previous five years, 5.5 million pages in 17 languages were created on the internet about &quot;Earth Day 2018&quot; and &quot;plastics,&quot; and global media outlets with a combined audience of 450+ million people covered the campaign. The phrase &quot;plastic pollution&quot; on social media in the U.S. alone reached more than 155 million people. As a result, over 23,0000+ plastic cleanups were registered on Google, 60 countries introduced single-use plastic bans and legislation, and companies such as Coca-Cola and Starbucks announced steps to eliminate and significantly reduce plastic pollution.

=== Earth Day 2019 ===
Earth Day 2019&#x27;s theme was Protect Our Species. For this campaign, events and programs spread information about the causes and consequences of growing species extinctions.

== Earth Day 2020–2030 ==
=== Earth Day 2020 ===
Earth Day 2020 is the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day. Celebrations included activities such as the Great Global CleanUp, Citizen Science, Advocacy, Education, and art. The theme for Earth Day 2020 was &quot;climate action&quot;. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the planned activities were moved online. Notably, a coalition of youth activist organized by the Future Coalition hosted Earth Day Live, a three-day livestream commemorating the 50th anniversary of Earth Day in the United States. Celebratory activities centered around five components: citizen science, volunteering, community engagement, education, and the role of art in furthering the cause.

=== Earth Day 2021 ===

The Earth Day 2021 theme is Restore Our Earth and features five primary programs: The Canopy Project, Food and Environment, Climate Literacy, the Global Earth Challenge, and The Great Global CleanUp. During the week of Earth Day, earthday.org and lead organizers, Education International, Hip Hop Caucus, and Earth Uprising organized three separate parallel climate action summits on climate literacy, environmental justice, and youth-led climate-focused issues. Earthday.org also organized the second-annual Earth Day Live livestream event (April 22, 2021) featuring global activists, international leaders, and influencers.

The Biden administration organized a 2021 Leaders&#x27; Climate Summit. This virtual Zoom-like meeting featured 40 world leaders and dozens of speakers, including Pope Francis, Xiye Bastida, Danielle Merfeld, Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, GE Renewable Energy, Anna Borg, President and CEO, Vattenfall, and Abdullah Subai, Minister of Municipality and Environment, Qatar.
=== Earth Day 2022 ===
The Earth Day 2022 theme is Invest in Our Planet and features five primary programs: The Great Global Cleanup, Sustainable Fashion, Climate and Environmental Literacy, Canopy Project, Food and Environment, and the Global Earth Challenge. Earthday.org announced the continuation of the &quot;Invest in our Planet&quot; theme for 2023 and that more than one billion citizens participated in Earth Day 2022.

=== Earth Day 2023 ===
The official theme for 2023 was &quot;Invest In Our Planet&quot; On Earth Day 2023, a collection of images of Earth taken from various deep space distances in the Solar System was published.

=== Earth Day 2024 ===
The theme for Earthday.org 2024 is Planet vs. Plastics and to mark that Earthday.org has called for a 60% global reduction in plastic production by 2040.

In November 2023, to bring public attention to the health threat that microplastics pose, earthday.org released its report Babies vs. Plastics, which collated some of the latest science on the subject. The Guardian newspaper carried an Op Ed about the report highlighting that it is the children of the Global South who are being the most impacted by exposure to microplastics.

==Earth Day Canada==

The first Canadian Earth Day () was held on Thursday, September 11, 1980, and was organized by Paul D. Tinari, then a graduate student in Engineering Physics/Solar Engineering at Queen&#x27;s University. Flora MacDonald, then MP for Kingston and the Islands and former Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, officially opened Earth Day Week on September 6, 1980, with a ceremonial tree planting and encouraged MPs and MPPs across the country to declare a cross-Canada annual Earth Day. The principal activities taking place on the first Earth Day included educational lectures given by experts in various environmental fields, garbage and litter pick-up by students along city roads and highways, and tree plantings to replace the trees killed by Dutch elm disease.

==History of the Equinox Earth Day (March 20)==

The equinoctial Earth Day is celebrated on the March equinox (around March 20) to mark the arrival of astronomical spring in the Northern Hemisphere, and of astronomical autumn in the Southern Hemisphere. An equinox in astronomy is that point in time (not a whole day) when the Sun is directly above the Earth&#x27;s equator, occurring around March 20 and September 23 each year. In most cultures, the equinoxes and solstices are considered to start or separate the seasons, although weather patterns evolve earlier.

John McConnell first introduced the idea of a global holiday called &quot;Earth Day&quot; at the 1969 UNESCO Conference on the Environment. The first Earth Day proclamation was issued by San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General U Thant supported McConnell&#x27;s global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:
May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful Spaceship Earth as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.

United Nations secretary-general Kurt Waldheim observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). Margaret Mead added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:

At the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the Japanese Peace Bell, which Japan donated to the United Nations. Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration. On March 20, 2008, in addition to the ceremony at the United Nations, ceremonies were held in New Zealand, and bells were sounded in California, Vienna, Paris, Lithuania, Tokyo, and many other locations. The equinox Earth Day at the UN is organized by the Earth Society Foundation.

Earth Day ringing the peace bell is celebrated around the world in many towns, ringing the Peace Bell in Vienna, Berlin, and elsewhere. A memorable event took place at the UN in Geneva, celebrating a Minute for Peace ringing the Japanese Shinagawa Peace Bell with the help of the Geneva Friendship Association and the Global Youth Foundation, directly after in deep mourning about the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant catastrophe ten days before.

Besides the Spring Equinox for the Northern Hemisphere, the observance of the Spring Equinox for the Southern Hemisphere in September is of equal importance. The International Day of Peace is celebrated on September 21, and can thus be considered to accord with the original intentions of John McConnell, U Thant and others.

==April 22 observances==

===Growing eco-activism before Earth Day 1970===
In 1968, Morton Hilbert and the U.S. Public Health Service organized the Human Ecology Symposium, an environmental conference for students to hear from scientists about the effects of environmental degradation on human health. This was the beginning of Earth Day. For the next two years, Hilbert and students worked to plan the first Earth Day. In April 1970along with a federal proclamation from U.S. Sen. Gaylord Nelsonthe first Earth Day was held.

Project Survival, an early environmentalism-awareness education event, was held at Northwestern University on January 23, 1970. This was the first of several events held at university campuses across the United States in the lead-up to the first Earth Day. Also, Ralph Nader began talking about the importance of ecology in 1970.

The 1960s had been a very dynamic period for ecology in the US. Pre-1960 grassroots activism against DDT in Nassau County, New York, and widespread opposition to open-air nuclear weapons tests with their global nuclear fallout, had inspired Rachel Carson to write her influential bestseller, &quot;Silent Spring&quot; (1962).

===Significance of April 22===

Nelson chose the date to maximize participation on college campuses for what he conceived as an &quot;environmental teach-in&quot;. He determined the week of April 19–25 was the best bet as it did not fall during exams or spring breaks. Moreover, it did not conflict with religious holidays such as Easter or Passover, and was late enough in spring to have decent weather. More students were likely to be in class, and there would be less competition with other mid-week eventsso he chose Wednesday, April 22. The day also fell after the anniversary of the birth of noted conservationist John Muir. The National Park Service, John Muir National Historic Site, has a celebration every year on or around Earth Day (April 21, 22 or 23), called Birthday–Earth Day, in recognition of Earth Day and John Muir&#x27;s contribution to the collective consciousness of environmentalism and conservation.

Unbeknownst to Nelson, April 22, 1970, was coincidentally the 100th anniversary of the birth of Vladimir Lenin, when translated to the Gregorian calendar (which the Soviets adopted in 1918). &quot;Time&quot; reported that some suspected the date was not a coincidence, but a clue that the event was &quot;a Communist trick&quot;, and quoted a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution as saying, &quot;subversive elements plan to make American children live in an environment that is good for them.&quot; J. Edgar Hoover, director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, may have found the Lenin connection intriguing; it was alleged the FBI conducted surveillance at the 1970 demonstrations. The idea that the date was chosen to celebrate Lenin&#x27;s centenary still persists in some quarters, an idea borne out by the similarity with the subbotnik instituted by Lenin in 1920 as days on which people would have to do community service, which typically consisted in removing rubbish from public property and collecting recyclable material. Subbotniks were also imposed on other countries within the compass of Soviet power, including Eastern Europe, and at the height of its power the Soviet Union established a nationwide subbotnik to be celebrated on Lenin&#x27;s birthday, April 22, which had been proclaimed a national holiday celebrating communism by Nikita Khrushchev in 1955.

== Criticisms ==
&quot;Critics of Earth Day claim that the environmental movement is a middle class, anti-business movement that deals in mainstream conservation politics. It allegedly overlooks the needs of minorities and the poor who are victims of environmental racism and classism.&quot;

Another criticism of Earth Day is that after so many years, its continued, repetitious existence promotes the illusion that current human efforts are enough to eliminate future environmental disaster.

<doc id="158549" wikidata="Q543634" url="?curid=158549" title="Rhonda Shear">
<text>Rhonda Honey Shear (born November 12, 1954) is an American television personality, comedienne, actress, and entrepreneur. She is known for her role as a host in the 1990s USA Network&#x27;s weekend B movie show, &quot;USA Up All Night&quot;. In 2001, she started an intimate apparel business that was marketed on Home Shopping Network (HSN), with one of her most successful products being the Ahh Bra in 2010. She is a regular participant in Tampa Bay&#x27;s annual Fashion Week events.

==Early life==
Shear was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. She attended Loyola University, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications. After graduating from Loyola in 1977, she moved to Los Angeles, California, to pursue a career in Hollywood.

==Career==
===Modeling, hosting, and acting===
Shear earned titles in several beauty contests, including holding the titles of Miss Louisiana USA 1975 for Miss USA and that of Miss Louisiana for both the Miss World and the Miss International pageants. She appeared as a contestant in &quot;The Gong Show&quot; in 1979. She also appeared as grown up Kimmy Gibbler in the 1987 sitcom, &quot;Full House&quot;.

Shear is best known for her role as a host of the USA Network&#x27;s 1980s and &#x27;90s weekend B-movie show, &quot;USA Up All Night&quot;. From 1991 to 1998, she hosted in-studio and on-location segments that typically aired on Friday nights, replacing comedian Caroline Schlitt (the Friday night host for the show&#x27;s first few years). She also occasionally hosted the show with her Saturday counterpart, Gilbert Gottfried, in addition to making cameos on his edition. Her trademark manner of speaking the show&#x27;s title, by raising her voice an octave when saying the word &quot;Up&quot;, became a catch phrase. Shear also briefly hosted a comedy program called &quot;Spotlight Cafe&quot; on WWOR-TV in Secaucus, New Jersey, hosted previously by comic Judy Tenuta.

Shear made two subsequent nude appearances in &quot;Playboy&quot;: First, in their &quot;Funny Girls&quot; pictorial in June 1991, then in her own pictorial titled &quot;Rhonda Is Up All Night&quot; in October 1993.

Shear also co-starred in numerous sitcoms from playing the Fonz&#x27;s girlfriend on &quot;Happy Days&quot; to the sexy neighbor on &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, before making her mark as a comedian. She then made her way into stand-up comedy, headlining as a successful comedian in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and New York, and eventually touring across the country with &quot;Comedy PJ Party&quot;, an on-stage slumber party featuring a number of comedians.

===Entrepreneur career===
In 2001, Shear, with her husband Van Fagan, started Shear Enterprises. She began designing from her home office in 2003 with three employees, and launched the Rhonda Shear Intimates line at Home Shopping Network. Her products were picked up on shopping networks around the world, including The Shopping Channel (Canada) and Ideal World Shopping (U.K.). Rhonda Shear Intimates has continued to grow and is now represented in over 40 countries with over 25 employees in her St. Petersburg, Florida offices.

In 2010, Shear designed the Ahh Bra, and the product was an overnight success. The Ahh Bra was the number-one selling bra worldwide with over 25 million sold internationally. In 2011, the company had $72 million in sales. As of 2013, she has added cosmetics, swim wear, fragrances, and Boomer Hottie.

In 2014, a line of &quot;intimates, athleisure, and loungewear&quot; was announced that was co-designed with Crystal Hefner, 2009 &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate and wife of Hugh Hefner, to be sold through Hefner&#x27;s website.

Shear has written a book titled &quot;Up All Night: From Hollywood Bombshell to Lingerie Mogul, Life Lessons from an Accidental Feminist&quot;, released in October 2017.

==Charity work==
In 2011, Shear was the event chair and a sponsor for American Cancer Society&#x27;s Making Strides: Put on Your Pink Bra Event. Between speaking engagements, creating a giant flying bra for the RedBull Flugtag, and helping with fundraising events, Shear got the chance to meet with women struggling in treatment or following surgery who needed bras that were affordable, feminine, and comfortable. She was struck by their stories, strength, and sense of community. Shear stays connected by donating product every month to women&#x27;s shelters around the country and continuing her work nationwide with various charitable organizations that fund research and empower women.

==Personal life==
Shear married her childhood sweetheart Van Fagen, who works as her business partner in Shear Enterprises. They live in St. Petersburg, Florida.

<doc id="158550" wikidata="Q3821752" url="?curid=158550" title="Types of rural communities">
<text>Rural Sociologists have identified a number of different types of rural communities, which have arisen as a result of changing economic trends within rural regions of industrial nations.

The basic trend seems to be one in which communities are required to become entrepreneurial. Those that lack the sort of characteristics mentioned below, are forced to either seek out their niche or accept eventual economic defeat. These towns focus on marketing and public relations whilst bidding for business and government operations, such as factories or off-site data processing.

For instance, International Falls, Minnesota markets itself as a site for sub-zero temperature experiments, Ottawa, Illinois has attracted three Japanese firms, Freeport, Maine has become a center for mail-order companies such as L. L. Bean, and Mobile, Arizona has become the home of a number of solid-waste landfills.

==Academic communities==
The primary employers in an academic community are boarding schools, colleges, universities, research laboratories, or corporate training facilities. These academic institutions attract people from other regions, bringing new capital into the area.

Academic institutions in rural areas are very much like factories in that the economic success of the community depends upon the success of the institution. However, academic institutions primarily offer medium-skilled or professional jobs, while factories tend toward low-skilled work.

Examples: Ames, Iowa; Bath, Maine; Plainfield, Vermont.

==Area Trade-Centers==
The automobile allows rural residents to travel farther, in less time, for goods and services. This, along with decreasing rural population, reduces the importance of the rural store. As businesses relocate from other communities, one town will become the trade center for its region, sometimes constructing a shopping mall.

Generally, businesses in a trade-center town, except for those in competition with the mall, will benefit from the mall&#x27;s presence as shoppers spill over. However, business in nearby towns will suffer as shoppers converge on the town with the greatest variety of stores.

Examples: West Burlington, Iowa; Wickenburg, Arizona.

==Exurbs==
See: Commuter town, Exurb

==Government centers==
Government in rural regions is becoming increasingly consolidated, so that a small number of towns are centers of government activity, while the rest are devoid of government infrastructure. These centers include state and local capitals, and areas with prisons or military bases.

Centralized public administration focuses public-sector employment on a single community, assisting it over its neighbors. Benefits for the government center include improved public services, increased efficiency, and economic savings.

Examples: Lorton, Virginia; Quantico, Virginia.

==Recreation communities==
Recreation communities (&quot;tourist towns&quot;) define some local feature, usually a historic site or scenic vista, as a &quot;natural resource&quot; and market this to tourists. Travelers will then spend money on food, hotels, and the like, which brings capital into the town.

Examples: Deadwood, South Dakota; Harper&#x27;s Ferry, West Virginia; Tombstone, Arizona; St. Charles, Missouri; Pleasant Hill, Kentucky; Intercourse, Pennsylvania.

==Retirement communities==
Retirement communities tend to house large numbers of elderly people who have left the workforce. These retirees bring pensions, Social Security, and savings which infuse the area with capital. Many rural hospitals do not have enough patients to support their operational budgets, but those near retirement communities can make up for this by focusing on gerontology.

Retirement communities often have income inequality between local residents and those who have migrated from cities.

Examples: Green Valley, Arizona; Heritage Village, Connecticut.

<doc id="158555" wikidata="Q1135326" url="?curid=158555" title="Remote work">
<text>Remote work (also called telecommuting, telework, work from or at home, WFH as an initialism, hybrid work, and other terms) is the practice of working at or from one&#x27;s home or another space rather than from an office or workplace.

Working at home is not a new practice, but &quot;remote working&quot; for offices and factories activity began on a small scale in the 1970s, when technology was developed which could link satellite offices to downtown mainframes through dumb terminals using telephone lines as a network bridge. It became more common in the 1990s and 2000s, facilitated by internet technologies such as collaborative software on cloud computing and conference calling via videotelephony. In 2020, workplace hazard controls for COVID-19 catalyzed a rapid transition to remote work for white-collar workers around the world, which largely persisted even after restrictions were lifted.

Proponents of having a geographically distributed workforce argue that it reduces costs associated with maintaining an office, grants employees autonomy and flexibility that improves their motivation and job satisfaction, eliminates environmental harms from commuting, allows employers to draw from a more geographically diverse pool of applicants, and allows employees to relocate to a place they would prefer to live.

Opponents of remote work argue that remote telecommunications technology has been unable to replicate the advantages of face-to-face interaction, that employees may be more easily distracted and may struggle to maintain separation between work and non-work spheres without the physical separation, and that the reduced social interaction may lead to feelings of isolation.

==History==
Working at home is not a new practice. Between 1670 and 1826, management had to rely on trust and control to successfully manage distributed work. During this time, in addition to dispersed operations that relied heavily on a combination of explicit information and detailed record-keeping, more tacit and situated knowledge developed through socialization. For example, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company showed a variety of control mechanisms including selection techniques, information requirements, and direct local oversight through its distributed practices of socialization, communication, and participation. Managers found that &quot;common sense&quot; was not enough to encourage everyone to comply.

The England and Wales census of 1911 included a question about each resident person&#x27;s employment (if any) and included a question about whether they worked &quot;at home&quot;.

In the early 1970s, technology was developed that linked satellite offices to downtown mainframes through dumb terminals using telephone lines as a network bridge. The terms &quot;telecommuting&quot; and &quot;telework&quot; were coined by Jack Nilles in 1973. In 1979, five IBM employees were allowed to work from home as an experiment. By 1983, the experiment was expanded to 2,000 people. By the early 1980s, branch offices and home workers were able to connect to organizational mainframes using personal computers and terminal emulators.

In 1995, the motto that &quot;work is something you do, not something you travel to&quot; was coined. Variations of this motto include: &quot;Work is what we do, not where we are.&quot;

Since the 1980s, the normalization of remote work has been on a steady incline. For example, the number of Americans working from home grew by 4 million from 2003 to 2006, and by 1983 academics were beginning to experiment with online conferencing.

In the 1990s and 2000s, remote work became facilitated by technology such as collaborative software, virtual private networks, conference calling, videotelephony, internet access, cloud computing, voice over IP (VoIP), mobile telecommunications technology such as a Wi-Fi-equipped laptop or tablet computers, smartphones, and desktop computers, using software such as Zoom, Webex, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, Slack, and WhatsApp.

In his 1992 travelogue &quot;Exploring the Internet&quot;, Carl Malamud described a &quot;digital nomad&quot; as a person who &quot;travels the world with a laptop, setting up FidoNet nodes.&quot; In 1993, Random House published the &quot;Digital Nomad&#x27;s Guide&quot; series of guidebooks by Mitch Ratcliffe and Andrew Gore. The guidebooks, &quot;PowerBook&quot;, &quot;AT&amp;T EO Personal Communicator&quot;, and &quot;Newton&#x27;s Law&quot;, used the term &quot;digital nomad&quot; to refer to the increased mobility and more powerful communication and productivity technologies that facilitated remote work.

European hacker spaces of the 1990s led to coworking; the first such space opened in 2005. The new economy production no longer requires people to work together in the same physical space to access the tools and resources they need to produce their work and allows for distributed work.

In 2010, the Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 required each executive agency in the United States to establish policy allowing remote work to the maximum extent possible, so long as employee performance is not diminished.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of workers began remote work for the first time. Cities in which the population of remote workers increased significantly were referred to as Zoom towns. According to a U.S. Labor Department study published, millions of Americans ceased working from home by 2022, and the number of employers reporting teleworking decreasing to the level before pandemic levels. From August to September 2022, approximately 72 percent of private-sector businesses reported little to no telework among workers, compared to roughly 60 percent from July to September 2021. During the Information Age, many startups were founded in the homes of entrepreneurs who lacked financial resources.

=== Remote work during COVID-19 ===
A 2020 study of the then-ongoing pandemic estimated that 93% of world workers lived in countries with some sort of workplace closure. This figure was composed of: 32% living in countries with required closures for &quot;all&quot; but essential workplaces; 42% in countries where specific firms or worker categories had been closed; and 19% in countries with only recommended workplace closures.

The extensive use of remote work under COVID-19 constituted a major organizational transformation. However, the implementation of remote work during COVID-19 was hurried, and new technologies and operating systems had to be implemented without previous testing or training. Organizations reported concerns about losses in culture and productivity whilst workers were more concerned about declines in social interactions, internet connectivity and increased workload. Additionally, 25% of remote-working Americans were resistant to employer mandates to return to in-office work.

The abrupt transition to remote work during the pandemic led to an increase in both physical and mental health issues among workers; a lack of dedicated workspaces and distractions from others in the home were common negative influences on health and well-being, while effective communication with coworkers was supportive of health and well-being. The transition also increased the amount of time that individuals spent sitting at a workstation by up to two hours more per day, yet, most workers indicated being as productive working remotely as compared to office work before the pandemic. Supporting workers to identify effective approaches for boundary management between home and work across physical spaces, social interactions, and use of time are critical.

The transition to remote work during the pandemic highlighted the importance of access and equity among individual workers to support productivity and well-being. The remote work arrangement during COVID-19 was better for higher-paid and higher-management personnel in terms of productivity and reported well-being; whereas individuals at the bottom end of the earning spectrum experience reduced remuneration. Utility bills also increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in an inconsistent manner. Utility bills for minorities and lower income individuals were more likely to increase because they lived in housing that was older, with less effective insulation and without energy-efficient appliances. The increase in electricity also came due to the people using their utilities at different times of the day.

A 2024 PNAS study found that remote work dispersed economic activity away from city centers, in particular in cities with high levels of remote work.

==Statistics==
In 2020, 12.3% of employed persons, including 13.2% of women and 11.5% of men, in the European Union who were aged 15–64, usually worked from home. By country, the percentage of workers that worked from home was highest in Finland (25.1%), Luxembourg (23.1%), Ireland (21.5%), Austria (18.1%), and the Netherlands (17.8%) and lowest in Bulgaria (1.2%), Romania (2.5%), Croatia (3.1%), Hungary (3.6%), and Latvia (4.5%).

In 2023, economist and telework expert Nicholas Bloom said about a third of all working days are remote, slashing corporate real estate expenditures, and up from 5% before the pandemic. Bloom believes quickly progressing technology has facilitated and will continue the trend, but drawbacks for some kinds of positions will remain.

A September 2022 study surveyed workers from 26 countries in mid-2021 and early 2022. Its respondents work from home an average of 1.5 days per week.

=== United States ===
According to a Gallup poll in September 2021, 45% of full-time U.S. employees worked from home, including 25% who worked from home all of the time and 20% who worked from home part of the time. 91% of those who work remotely (fully or partially) hoped to continue to do so after the pandemic. Among all workers, 54% believed that their company&#x27;s culture would be unchanged by remote work, while 12% believed it would improve and 33% predicted it would deteriorate.

Gallup found in February 2023 that, among remote-capable employees in the U.S., 20% worked on-site, 28% exclusively remote and 52% hybrid.

According to the United States Office of Personnel Management, 50% of all U.S. federal workers were eligible to work remotely and agencies saved more than $180 million because of remote work in fiscal 2020.

A September 2022 study surveyed workers in mid-2021 and early 2022. Its 2,079 US subjects worked from home on average 1.6 days per week, similar to the global average of 1.5 days per week.

=== United Kingdom ===
These results may vary based on the type of sample collected. Certain groups may have fewer office-workers, e.g., in more urban locations or industries requiring more manual labour. As such groups may find remote working impossible, their presence or absence in these samples may affect the analysis.

A June 2022 survey of 56 offices found that 51% had no policy requiring office attendance, 18% requiring two days per week, 11% requiring three days per week, and 20% had policy set at team-level.

A September 2022 study surveyed workers in mid-2021 and early 2022. Its 1,501 UK subjects worked from home on average two days per week – above the global average of 1.5 days per week.

An April 2023 survey of 558 central London workers&#x27; requirements for onsite working found the most common response was two and three days per week at 26% and 21% of responses respectively. Fewer cited one, four, and five days, each making 8–11% of responses. Having no requirement was second-most common at 25% of responses. It also found that about 18% of vacancies listed by London companies in February 2023 were hybrid or remote, up from about 4% in February 2020.

An early 2023 survey of 2,049 workers found that 35% must work onsite for two days, 33% for three days, and 33% always work from home. In a separate question, 7% said their employer does not allow hybrid working.

A March 2023 survey of 2,016 adults found a roughly even distribution of required onsite days per week peaking at two and three days at about 16% each. However, it found a large spike in five days per week, the most common response at over 35%. About 13% were required to work fewer than one day per week.

Countering the above results suggesting a peak around 2–3 days per week, an April 2023 survey of 1,000 office workers found a peak of five days per week required onsite. Requirements for fewer days were progressively rarer, culminating in 0% saying they must work onsite less than once per month.

A May 2022 survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) found that 14% of working arrangements were fully remote, 24% were hybrid, and 46% were fully onsite.

A June 2023 survey of 2,000 full-time workers found that 6% of working arrangements were fully remote, 46% were hybrid, and 48% were fully onsite.

An Autumn Survey by ONS found that more than a quarter of working adults in Great Britain (28%) had hybrid arrangements. They found that those aged over 30, parents and managers and professionals were the most likely to log on from home.

For those able to have a hybrid arrangement, the ONS said there were significant perks, including an average of 56 minutes saved from commuting, and spending an average of 24 minutes more on sleep and rest and 15 minutes more on exercise, sports and wellbeing.

==Key concepts==
There are several key terms associated with collocated work and distributed work. The most important concepts are common ground, coupling in work, collaboration readiness, and technology readiness. This section will briefly define these four concepts.

Common ground refers to the knowledge that participants have in common, and they are aware that they have this information in common. Common ground is not just established from some general knowledge about the person&#x27;s background, but also through specific knowledge learned from several different cues that are available at the moment, including the person&#x27;s appearance and behavior during conversational interactions. The figure below, shows the characteristics that contribute to achieving common ground that are inherent in various communication media.

It is important to note that those who are remote complain about the difficulty of establishing common ground. This is because when individuals are connected by audio conferencing, it is difficult to tell who is speaking if you do not know the participant well. However, people with video can engage in the subtle negotiation that establishes local common ground- whether what was said was understood or not, whether the conversation can proceed or needs repair. Overall, the more common ground people can establish, the easier the communication will be and the greater the productivity.

Coupling refers to the extent and kind of communication required by the work. Tightly coupled work is work that strongly depends on the talents of collections of workers and is non-routine, and even ambiguous. Components of this type of work are highly interdependent, meaning that the work requires frequent, complex communication among group members, with short feedback loops and multiple streams of information. This type of communication is very difficult in remote locations, mostly because technology does not support rapid back and forth conversations or awareness and repair of ambiguity. On the other hand, loosely coupled work has fewer dependencies or is more routine. It is important that all group members establish common ground about the task, goals, and procedures before working, but this type of work overall requires less frequent or less complicated interactions.

Collaboration readiness is a groups willingness to work together and share their ideas. Using shared technology assumes that the coworkers need to share information and are rewarded for sharing it. It is important to note that one should not attempt to introduce groupware and remote technologies in organizations and communities that do not have a culture of sharing and collaboration.

Common ground is often used in collaboration, where a team is out to solve a complex problem. In order to solve a complex problem, the different skills and perspectives of members in a team must be pooled together. To do so, the team must make sure that they are on common ground in terms of knowledge and representation of the problem. Care must be taken to note that to achieve common ground when collaborating, differences are constructively managed, rather than downplayed. This is because collaboration differs from compromise.

Technology readiness is a company or groups willingness and ability to use technology. Companies require a technical infrastructure if they are going to adopt technologies in the company. In particular, they require the habits, including those of preparation, regular access, attention given to others’ need for information, in order to effectively use the necessary technology for distributed work. Researchers repeatedly see that failure of distributed work often results from attempts to introduce new technologies to organizations or communities that are not yet comfortable with technologies that are already in place. The following chart explains the order in which various collaboration technologies should be adopted in organizations to allow the employees to become familiar with and learn each new technology.

The list below shows the observed order in which various collaboration technologies were adopted and used in different organizations.
* Telephone
* Fax
* E-mail
* Audio conferencing
* Voicemail
* E-mail with attachments
* Video conferencing
* Repositories built by others (e.g., intranet sites of static information)
* Shared calendaring
* Creating repositories
* Hand-off collaboration (e.g., using the Tracking Changes option in MS Word)
* Simultaneous collaboration (e.g., NetMeeting, Exceed, or Timbuktu screen sharing)

As this chart shows, advanced technologies should be introduced in small steps.

These key concepts are important because they help differentiate between collocated and distributed work. Later on, a fifth concept of organizational management was proposed. Organizational management is the &quot;practices by which management activities are part of shaping the fundamental premises for collaboration without proximity&quot;

===Distributed versus collocated teams===
There are two types of work that explain the geographical distance between coworkers/collaborators. Collocated work is the case in which team members are at the same location. Distributed work is the term used to explain team members who are not in the same physical location when working on a project. There are many differences, similarities, benefits, and obstacles between these two types of work. In order to distinguish between collocated and distributed work, it is necessary to go into more detail.

Collocated work is the case in which the team members are at the same physical location. This may be temporary due to travel to a common location or permanent because all collaborators of the group are at the common work site. Same location means that the coworkers can get to each other&#x27;s workspaces with a short walk and communicate via face-to-face interactions. Also, during meetings or small group meetings, a major advantage of collocated work is that individuals are able to move from one meeting to another, simply by overhearing a conversation, seeing what someone is working on, and being aware of how long they had worked on it with or without progress. In addition, during these meetings, coworkers can observe someone&#x27;s reaction by being able to see his/her gesture or glance. This allows for one to make sure that the group has common ground prior to moving on. Also, coworkers have access to common spaces for group interactions and have mutual access to significant shared information. In a study, researchers observed an individual describe something by drawing with his hands in the air. Later, someone referred to “that idea” by pointing to the spot in the air where the first person had &quot;drawn his idea&quot;.

Opposite of collocated work, distributed work is the case in which team members are not physically in the same location. Thus, they are forced to use different methods of technology to communicate to make progress on the project/problem they are working on. Today, the technology distributed work groups use to communicate is constantly changing because of rapid changes and because different groups have varying access to technology. describe the options of communication today which include:
* Telephony in its current incarnation
* Meeting room video conferencing
* Desktop video and audio conferencing
* Chat rooms for text interactions
* File transfer
* Application sharing
* Some very primitive virtual reality options

Distributed work can be very successful, if the company or group displays technology readiness. Some of the benefits of distributed work include:
* Simultaneous access to real-time data from instruments around the world, allowing coworkers to talk while something is happening
* Cost reduction – both for the employee and the employer. While the company experience sales costs on supplies, office space rental, etc., the remote worker has the same benefit on reducing their own cost on things like meals, fuel and car maintenance.
* Microsoft NetMeeting has been a success. People who had previously driven long distances to attend a meeting in their area began attending from their offices. These individuals chose to forego the time and stress of travel in favor of remote participation
* Ongoing work – 1,000 software engineers working on the project in four sites. Has allowed numerous people at various different sites to stay in contact over email video and audio conferencing, transferred files and fax. If everyone understands the structure of the collaborative work and knows his or her role, distributed work can be a success.

Distributed work is far from perfect and there are many failures, some of which include:
* Complaints about the quality of communication over audio and video conferencing
* Hard to detect a person&#x27;s motivation when you are not in the office. For example, if someone had a tough meeting you do not know this and therefore will not know that it is not the right time to send a lengthy, stern email. One important feature of collocation that is missing in remote work is awareness of the state of one&#x27;s coworkers, both their presence-absence and their mental state.

Overall, people who have little common ground benefit significantly from having a video channel.

===Communication technology===
Effective group communication involves various nonverbal communication characteristics. Because distance limits interpersonal interaction between members of distributed groups, these characteristics often become constrained. Communication media focuses on alternative ways to achieve these qualities and promote effective communication. This section addresses communication technology in relation to the theories of grounding and mutual knowledge and discusses the costs and benefits of various communication technology tools.

====Grounding and technology====

Grounding in communication is the process of updating the evolving common ground, or shared information, between participants. The base of mutual knowledge is important for effective coordination and communication. Additionally, participants constantly gather various forms of verbal and nonverbal evidence to establish understanding of change and task.

The following are means of grounding and collecting evidence:

Different forms of communication result in the varied presence of these communication characteristics. Therefore, the nature of communication technology can either promote or inhibit grounding between participants. The absence of grounding information results in reduced ability to read and understand social cues. This increases the social distance between them.

====Costs to grounding change====

The lack of one of these characteristics generally forces participants to use alternative grounding techniques, because the costs associated with grounding change. There is often a trade-off between the costs: one cost will increase as another decreases. There is also often a correlation between the costs. The following table highlights several of the costs that can change as the medium of communication changes.

====Examples of communication technology====

; Structured Management (Hinds &amp; Kiesler)
It has been argued that work can be adapted to individual situations through task decomposition and version control. This can be applied to distributed groups by allowing groups to divide the work into manageable chunks. Group members can work autonomously and come together to produce a finished product. Many recent software developments have been built to specifically address this method.

; Email
Email prevents the communication of verbal inferences, such as sarcasm and humor and, additionally, leaves email writers unaware of what their communication is lacking. When people try to anticipate the perspective of their email audience, studies suggest that they end up pulling upon their own experience and perspective instead. This often leads to inconsistencies in email conversation and chaotic communication.

==Legal aspects==
In 1996, the Home Work Convention, an International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention, was created to offer protection to workers who are employed in their own homes.

The UK&#x27;s National Minimum Wage Act 1998 makes specific reference to home workers who &quot;contract with a person, for the purposes of that person&#x27;s business, for the execution of work to be done in a place not under the control or management of that person&quot;. In the case of James v Redcats (Brands) Ltd (2007), it was confirmed that &quot;a home worker need not work at home, although typically he or she will do so; the only requirement is to work in a place not under the control or management of the other party&quot;.

==Potential benefits==
===Cost reduction===
Remote work can reduce costs for organizations, including the cost of office space and related expenses such as parking, computer equipment, furniture, office supplies, lighting and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. Certain employee expenses, such as office expenses, can be shifted to the remote worker, although this is the subject of lawsuits.

Remote work also reduces costs for the worker such as costs of travel/commuting and clothing. It also allows for the possibility of living in a cheaper area than that of the office.

===Higher employee motivation and job satisfaction due to autonomy and flexibility===
Consistent with job characteristic theory (1976), an increase in autonomy and feedback for employees leads to higher work motivation, satisfaction with personal growth opportunities, general job satisfaction, higher job performance, and lower absenteeism and turnover. Autonomy increased remote workers&#x27; satisfaction by reducing work-family conflicts, especially when workers were allowed to work outside traditional work hours and be more flexible for family purposes. Autonomy was the reason for an increase in employee engagement when the amount of time spent remote working increased. Remote workers have more flexibility and can shift work to different times of day and different locations to maximize their performance. The autonomy of remote work allows for arrangement of work to reduce work-family conflict and conflicts with recreational activities. However, studies also show that autonomy must be balanced with high levels of discipline if a healthy work/leisure balance is to be maintained.

Remote work may make it easier for workers to balance their work responsibilities with their personal life and family roles such as caring for children or elderly parents. Remote work improves efficiency by reducing travel time, and reduces commuting time and time stuck in traffic congestion, improving quality of life.

Remote working greatly increases the freedom employees have to choose where to work, such as a home, coffee shop or co-working space. This approach allows employees to choose their own beneficial working style in their preferred environment, further promoting a healthy work-life balance and providing productivity.

Providing the option to work remotely or adopting a hybrid work schedule has been an incentivizing benefit companies used in new hiring.

Hybrid is a flexible work model that allows employees to split their time between working in the office and working from home.

A 2007 meta-analysis of 46 studies of remote work involving 12,833 employees conducted by Ravi Gajendran and David A. Harrison in the &quot;Journal of Applied Psychology&quot;, published by the American Psychological Association (APA), found that remote work has largely positive effects on employees&#x27; job satisfaction, perceived autonomy, stress levels, manager-rated job performance, and (lower) work-family conflict, and lower turnover intention.

===Environmental benefits===

Remote work can reduce traffic congestion and air pollution, with fewer cars on the roads.

Most studies find that remote work overall results in a decrease in energy use due to less time spent on energy-intensive personal transportation, cleaner air, and a reduction of electricity usage due to a lower office space footprint.

During the COVID-19 lockdowns, the increase in remote work led to a decrease in global CO2 emissions. Partially due to the decrease in car commuting, carbon emissions dropped by 5.4%; however, emissions immediately increased to the same rate in the following year.

The increase in remote work had also led to people moving out of cities and into larger homes which catered for home office space.

===Increased productivity===
Remote work has long been promoted as a way to substantially increase employee productivity. A 2013 study showed a 13% increase in productivity among remotely working call-center employees at a Chinese travel agency. An analysis of data collected through March 2021 found that nearly six out of 10 workers reported being more productive working from home than they expected to be, compared with 14% who said they got less done.

Since work hours are less regulated in remote work, employee effort and dedication are far more likely to be measured purely in terms of output or results. However, traces of non-productive work activities (such as research, self-training, dealing with technical problems or equipment failures), and time lost on unsuccessful attempts (such as early drafts, fruitless endeavors, abortive innovations), are visible to employers.

Remote work improves efficiency by reducing or eliminating employees commute time, thus increasing their availability to work. In addition, remote work also helps employees achieve a better work-life balance.

An increase in productivity is also supported by sociotechnical systems (STS) theory (1951), which states that, unless absolutely essential, there should be minimal specification of objectives and how to do tasks in order to avoid inhibiting options or effective actions. Remote work provides workers with the freedom and power to decide how and when to do their tasks and therefore can increase productivity.

===Lower turnover intention and higher loyalty===
Turnover intention, or the desire to leave an organization, is lower for remote workers. Remote workers who experienced greater professional isolation actually had lower turnover intention.

A study of workers in 27 countries surveyed in mid-2021 and early 2022 found they would on average be willing to sacrifice 5% of their pay to be able to work from home two to three days per week. 26% would quit immediately or seek a new job if they were required to work five or more days per week.

A 2017 study showed that companies that offered remote work options experienced a 25% lower turnover rate.

Surveys by FlexJobs found that 81% of respondents said they would be more loyal to their employers if they had flexible work options. In a 2021 study by McKinsey &amp; Company, more than half of the workers supported companies adopting a hybrid work model, and more than a quarter stated that they would consider switching jobs if their current employer eliminated remote work options.

A 2021 employee survey reports preferring a more flexible working model. During the COVID-19 pandemic the working model showed the amount of employees who are working fully on site is 62%, with 30% hybrid and 8% remote. Post COVID-19 pandemic working models changed with the amount of employees who were fully on site at 37%, with 52% hybrid and 11% remote.

===Access to more employees/employers===
Remote work allows employees and employers to be matched despite major location differences.

Working responsibility is given to the employee who is skilled in that area of work.

=== Relocation opportunity ===
Remote workers may have the opportunity to relocate to another city or state for potential job opportunities and or lower cost of living. A 2020 survey found that 2.4% of people or 4.9 million Americans say they have moved because of remote work in 2020.

==Potential drawbacks and concerns==
=== Drawbacks due to reduced face-to-face interactions ===
The technology to communicate is not advanced enough to replicate face-to-face office interactions. Room for mistakes and miscommunication can increase. According to media richness theory (1986), face-to-face interactions provide the capacity to process rich information: ambiguous issues can be clarified, immediate feedback can be provided, and there is personalized communication (e.g. body language, tone of voice).

Remote work requires the use of various types of media to communicate, such as videotelephony, telephone, and email, which have drawbacks such as time lags, or ease of deciphering emotions and can reduce the speed and ease at which decisions are made. Asynchronous communication tends to be more difficult to manage and requires much greater coordination than synchronous communication. A phenomenon of &quot;Zoom fatigue&quot; has set in with amount of video meetings popularized by remote working. There have been four causes identified: The size of the faces on the screen and amount of eye contact required, looking at oneself during the video call is tiring, remaining still during the video call to stay in the screen, and communicating without gestures and non-verbal cues.

Face-to-face interactions increase interpersonal contact, connectedness, and trust.

In a 2012 study, 54% of remote workers thought they lost out on social interaction and 52.5% felt they lost out on professional interaction.

Remote working can hurt working relationships between remote workers and their coworkers, especially if their coworkers do not work remotely. Coworkers who do not work remotely can feel resentful and envious because they may consider it unfair if they are not allowed to work remotely as well. Remote workers miss out on in person companionship and do not benefit from on-site perks.

Adaptive structuration theory studies variations in organizations as new technologies are introduced. Adaptive structural theory proposes that structures (general rules and resources offered by the technology) can differ from structuration (how people actually use these rules and resources). There is an interplay between the intended use of technology and the way that people use the technology. Remote work provides a social structure that enables and constrains certain interactions. For instance, in office settings, the norm may be to interact with others face-to-face. To accomplish interpersonal exchange in remote work, other forms of interaction need to be used. AST suggests that when technologies are used over time, the rules and resources for social interactions will change. Remote work may alter traditional work practices, such as switching from primarily face-to-face communication to electronic communication.

Sharing information within an organization and teams can become more challenging when working remotely. While in the office, teams naturally share information and knowledge when they meet each other, for example, during coffee breaks. Sharing information requires more effort and proactive action when random-encounters do not happen. The sharing of tacit information also often takes place in unplanned situations where employees follow the activities of more experienced team members.

With remote work, it may also be difficult to obtain timely information, unless the regular sharing of information is taken care of separately. The situation where team members don&#x27;t know enough about what others are doing can lead them to make worse decisions or slow down decision-making.

From an anthropological perspective, remote work can interfere with the process of sensemaking, the forging of consensus or of a common worldview, which involves absorbing a wide range of signals.

Feedback increases employees&#x27; knowledge of results. Feedback refers to the degree that an individual receives direct and clear information about his or her performance related to work activities. Feedback is particularly important so that employees continuously learn how they are performing. Electronic communication provides fewer cues for remote workers and thus, they may have more difficulties interpreting and gaining information, and subsequently, receiving feedback. When a worker is not in the office, there is limited information and greater ambiguity, such as in assignments and expectations. Role ambiguity, when situations have unclear expectations as to what the worker is to do, may result in greater conflict, frustration, and exhaustion. In other studies regarding job characteristic theory, job feedback seemed to have the strongest relationship with overall job satisfaction compared to other job characteristics. While remote working, communication is not as immediate or rich as face-to-face interactions. Less feedback when remote working is associated with lower job engagement. Thus, when perceived supervisor support and relationship quality between leaders and remote workers decreases, job satisfaction of the remote worker decreases. The importance of manager communication with remote workers is made clear in a study that found that individuals have lower job satisfaction when their managers remote work. The clarity, speed of response, richness of the communication, frequency, and quality of the feedback are often reduced when managers remote work. Although the level of communication may decrease for remote workers, satisfaction with this level of communication can be higher for those who are more tenured and have functional instead of social relationships or those that have certain personalities and temperaments.

Social information processing suggests that individuals give meaning to job characteristics. Individuals have the ability to construct their own perception of the environment by interpreting social cues. This social information comes from overt statements from coworkers, cognitive evaluations of the job or task dimensions, and previous behaviors. This social context can affect individuals&#x27; beliefs about the nature of the job, the expectations for individual behavior, and the potential consequences of behavior, especially in uncertain situations. In remote work, there are fewer social cues because social exchange and personalized communication takes longer to process in computer-mediated communication than face-to-face interactions.

===Lessened work motivation===
Skill variety has the strongest relationship with internal work motivation. Jobs that allow workers to use a variety of skills increase workers&#x27; internal work motivation. If remote workers are limited in teamwork opportunities and have fewer opportunities to use a variety of skills, they may have lower internal motivation towards their work. Also, perceived social isolation can lead to less motivation.

Motivator-hygiene theory differentiates between motivating factors (motivators) and dissatisfying factors (hygienes). Factors that are motivators such as recognition and career advancement may be lessened with remote work. When remote workers are not physically present, they may be &quot;out of sight, out of mind&quot; to other workers in the office.

Not being in the office face-to-face can lead to workers not being able to do their work to the fullest potential because of lack of encouragement.

===Distractions===
Though working in an office has its distractions, it is often argued that remote work involves even greater distractions. According to one study, children are ranked as the number one distractions, followed by spouses, pets, neighbors, and solicitors. The lack of proper tools and facilities also serves as a major distraction, though this can be mitigated by using short-term coworking rental facilities. Also, some countries such as Romania have tasked the national labour inspectorate the burden of carrying out checks at remote workers&#x27; residences to see if the work environment meets the requirements. Workers may be more distracted due to a lack of monitoring, therefore lowering productivity.

=== Women burdening an unfair share of domestic work ===

Remote working may prove consequential for workers faced with a large burden of responsibilities at home. Analyses of 2010 and 2020–21 UK survey data suggest women are more likely to face a disproportionate share of domestic work.

A 2022 study surveyed 283 Austrian remote workers cohabiting with their intimate partner in mid-2020. Women with children in their household perceived the home office environment as significantly more exhausting, bearing longer working hours and blurred boundaries than their counterparts without children. Women without children in their household had positive outcomes when working from home due to better concentration.

A September 2022 study surveyed workers from 26 countries in mid-2021 and early 2022. It found that women valued the option to WFH more than men in almost all countries. Likewise, in most countries, both men and women with children valued working from home more than their counterparts without children.

=== Employee pressure to be seen as valuable ===
Remote workers may feel pressure to produce more output in order to be seen as valuable, and reduce the idea that they are doing less work than others. This pressure to produce output, as well as a lack of social support from limited coworker relationships and feelings of isolation, leads to lower job engagement in remote workers. Additionally, higher-quality relationships with teammates decreased job satisfaction of remote workers, potentially because of frustrations with exchanging interactions via technology. However, coworker support and virtual social groups for team building had a direct influence on increasing job satisfaction, perhaps due to an increase in skill variety from teamwork and an increase in task significance from more working relationships.

The inconsistent findings regarding remote work and satisfaction may be explained by a more complicated relationship. Presumably because of the effects of autonomy, initial job satisfaction increases as the amount of remote work increases; however, as remote work increases, declines in feedback and task significance lead job satisfaction to level off and decrease slightly. Thus, the amount of remote work influences the relationship between remote work and job satisfaction. Barriers to the continued growth of remote work include distrust from employers and personal disconnectedness for employees.

Working in the office with other workers could increase the potential of the worker.

===Challenges to team building; focus on the individual===
Communication and getting to know other teammates happen naturally when everyone works in the same space, so with remote work, employees and supervisors have to work harder to maintain relationships with co-workers. This is especially important for new employees so that they learn organizational habits even when working remotely.

Skill variety, task identity, and task significance influence how much employees think their jobs are meaningful. Skill variety is the degree of activities and skills that a job requires in order to complete a task. An increase in skill variety is thought to increase the challenge of the job. Increasing the challenge of the job increases the individual&#x27;s experienced meaningfulness, how much the individual cares about work, and finds it worthwhile. Remote work may not directly affect skill variety and task meaningfulness for the individual compared to when he or she worked in an office; however, skill variety and meaningfulness of individual tasks can increase when working in a group. If the work done at home is focused on the individual rather than the team, there may be fewer opportunities to use a variety of skills.

Task identity is the degree that the individual sees work from beginning to end or completes an identifiable or whole piece of work rather than only a small piece. Task significance is the degree that the individual feels his or her work has a substantial impact on the lives or work of other people within the organization or outside the organization. Remote work may not change the job characteristics of skill variety, task identity, and task significance compared to working in an office; however, the presence of these characteristics will influence remote workers&#x27; work outcomes and attitudes.

In his book &quot;Together: The Healing Power of Human Connection in a Sometimes Lonely World&quot;, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy asserts that face-to-face meetings, in-person collaboration, and &quot;micro-moments&quot; of community at work are what give people the essential feeling of belongingness and being part of a team.

===Isolation and mental health===
Research by Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a psychologist and professor at Brigham Young University, showed the most important predictor of living a long life is social integration.

A study by researchers at the University of Chicago showed that routine interactions with people benefits mental health.

In a 2018 study, Sigal G. Barsade, an organizational behavior professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, found that lonelier employees feel less committed to their employers and to their co-workers.

Isolation due to remote work also hinders formation of friendships.

Although several scholars and managers had previously expressed fears that employee careers might suffer and workplace relationships might be damaged because of remote work, a 2007 study found that there are no generally detrimental effects on the quality of workplace relationships and career outcomes. Remote work actually was found to positively affect employee-supervisor relations and the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intent was in part due to supervisor relationship quality. Only high-intensity remote work (where employees work from home for more than 2.5 days a week) harmed employee relationships with co-workers, even though it did reduce work-family conflict.

Individuals may differ in their reactions to the job characteristics in remote work. According to job characteristics theory, the personal need for accomplishment and development (&quot;growth need strength&quot;) influences how much an individual will react to the job dimensions of remote work. For instance, those individuals high in &quot;growth need strength&quot; will have a more positive reaction to increased autonomy and a more negative reaction to decreased feedback in remote work than those individuals low in &quot;growth need strength&quot;.

A 2021 report from Prudential found that the majority of people prefer the hybrid model, and that two in three workers believe in-person interactions are important for career growth. The report also found that fully remote workers felt less entitled to take a vacation and believed they must be available around the clock. One in four workers felt isolated and reported this as a major challenge. Ultimately, most workers want flexibility but do not want to give up the benefits available from working in-person with colleagues.

===Information security===
Employees need training, tools, and technologies for remote work. Remote work poses cybersecurity risks and people should follow best practices that include using antivirus software, keeping family members away from work devices, covering their webcams, using a VPN, using a centralized storage solution, making sure passwords are strong and secure, and being wary of email scams and email security.

In 2021, Vermont, South Carolina, South Dakota, Alabama, and Nebraska were named as the top five safest states for remote workers based on data breaches, stolen records, privacy laws, victim count, and victim loss.

A 2020 survey of over 1,000 remote workers showed that 59% of employees felt more cyber-secure working in-office compared to at home.

==== Technology or equipment issues ====
Employees having inadequate equipment or technology can prevent work from getting done. A FlexJobs survey found 28% had technical problems and 26% reported Wi-Fi issues.

===Loss of control by management===
Additionally, remote work may not always be seen positively by management due to fear of loss of managerial control. A study found that managers had a bias against employees who did not work in the office. Managers attributed the amount of time they saw an employee in the office more than the work than the contribution that was made.

===Alleged drop in worker productivity===
There have been conflicting data on the correlation between remote work and productivity. Some studies have found that remote work increases worker productivity and leads to higher supervisor ratings of performance and higher performance appraisals. However, another study found that professional isolation in remote workers led to a decrease in job performance, especially for those who spent more time remote working and engaged in fewer face-to-face interactions. Thus, similar to job attitudes, the amount of time spent remote working may also influence the relationship between remote work and job performance.

There may be a drop in remote worker productivity, which could be due to inadequate office setup. However, surveys found that over two-thirds of employers reported increased productivity among remote workers.

Traditional line managers are accustomed to managing by observation and not necessarily by results. This causes a serious obstacle in organizations attempting to adopt remote work. Liability and workers&#x27; compensation can become serious issues as well.

A 2008 study found that more time spent remote working decreased the perception of productivity of the remote worker by management.

The study &quot;Remote work mindsets predict emotions and productivity in home office: a longitudinal study of knowledge workers during the Covid-19 pandemic&quot; explores the impact of employees&#x27; mindsets on their adjustment to remote work during the pandemic. It finds that knowledge workers with a fixed mindset towards remote work experienced more negative emotions and less positive emotions, which subsequently led to perceptions of decreased productivity. Encouraging a growth mindset towards remote work, viewing it as a skill that can be developed, is suggested to improve employee experiences and productivity.

===Envy in the workplace===
Workers who do not have remote work privileges may be envious of those who do, leading to workplace controversies.

===Taxation complexity===
Remote workers are subject to taxation based on a combination of factors including their residence, the location of their employer, and the specific tax laws of the relevant jurisdictions. Generally, remote workers are taxed in accordance with the rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which they reside. Additionally, tax treaties between countries may impact the taxation of remote workers, providing guidelines to avoid double taxation. It is essential for remote workers to understand the tax laws and regulations applicable to their situation, and they may benefit from seeking guidance from tax professionals or consulting the relevant tax authorities to ensure compliance with tax obligations.

Tax implications of working remotely in a different jurisdiction than the employer are often not fully understood by remote workers.

===Health impacts due to increased hours working===
According to a 2021 report by the World Health Organization and the International Labour Organization, remote work could potentially increase health loss among workers if it increases working time to over 55 hours per week. Increased working hours include compromised health, well-being, and sleep as a consequence of disruption of the daily life routine, anxiety, worry, isolation, greater family and work stress, and excessive screen time.

==Distance work in the future==
In the future, design improvements and more horsepower will solve a number of current problems that currently cause limitations of distance technologies. Greater bandwidth will solve the disruptive influence of today&#x27;s delays in audio and video transmission. This will also allow for larger, smoother, more life-size displays of remote workers, making their interaction more similar to the flow of face-to-face interactions. In the future, it is possible that technology will provide capabilities that are in some ways superior to face-to-face options. However, it is likely that problems will result from distributed work technologies and from a lack of knowledge to operate the technologies in the future and face-to-face interactions will not be able to be eliminated.

<doc id="158557" wikidata="Q25398029" url="?curid=158557" title="Exurb">
<text>An exurb (or alternately: exurban area) is an area outside the typically denser inner suburban area, at the edge of a metropolitan area, which has some economic and commuting connection to the metro area, low housing-density,
and relatively high population-growth.
It shapes an interface between urban and rural landscapes, holding a limited urban nature for its functional, economic, and social interaction with the urban center, due to its dominant residential character. Exurbs consist of &quot;agglomerations of housing and jobs outside the municipal boundaries of a primary city&quot; and beyond the surrounding suburbs.

==Definitions==
The word &quot;exurb&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;extra (outside)&quot; and &quot;urban&quot;) was coined by Auguste Comte Spectorsky, in his 1955 book &quot;The Exurbanites&quot;, to describe the ring of prosperous communities beyond the suburbs, that are commuter towns for an urban area. In other uses the term has expanded to include popular extraurban districts which nonetheless may have poor transportation and underdeveloped economies due to their distance from the urban center. 

Exurbs can be defined in terms of population density across the extended urban area, for example &quot;the urban core (old urban areas including Siming and Huli, where the population density is greater than 51 persons per ha), the suburban zone (old urban and new urban transitional zones including Haicang and Jimei, where the population density is greater than 8 persons per ha), and the exurban areas (newly urbanized areas including Tong&#x27;an and Xiang&#x27;an, where the population density is less than 8 persons per ha)&quot;. The mixture of urban and rural environments raises ecological issues.

==Examples by country==
===China===
*Changping District, Beijing
*Shunyi District, Beijing
*Shenjia village, Loudi city, Hunan province

===Russia===
*Rublyovka, Moscow

===United States===

Since the &quot;Finding Exurbia&quot; report by the Brookings Institution in 2006, the term is generally used for areas beyond suburbs and specifically less densely built and populated than the suburbs to which the exurbs&#x27; residents commute. To qualify as exurban, a census tract must meet three criteria:
# Economic connection to a large metropolis. 
# Low housing density: bottom third of census tracts with regard to housing density. In 2000, this was a minimum of per resident.
# Population growth exceeding the average for its central metropolitan area.
These are based on published datasets. Alternative approaches include working with Oak Ridge National Laboratory LandScan data and GIS.

Exurban areas incorporate a mix of rural development (e.g., farms and open space) and in places, suburban-style development (e.g., tracts of single-family homes, though usually on large lots). In long-settled areas, such as the U.S. Northeast megalopolis, exurban areas incorporate pre-existing towns, villages and smaller cities, as well as strips of older single-family homes built along pre-existing roads that connected the older population centers of what was once a rural area.
The Brookings Institution listed exurban counties, defined as having at least 20% of their residents in exurban Census tracts.

<text>The King of Romania () or King of the Romanians () was the title of the monarch of the Kingdom of Romania from 1881 until 1947, when the Romanian Workers&#x27; Party proclaimed the Romanian People&#x27;s Republic following Michael I&#x27;s forced abdication.

==History==

The state had been internationally recognized as a principality since 1862, after the creation of the United Principalities, a personal union between Moldavia and Wallachia, at that time vassal states of the Ottoman Empire. Alexander I became &quot;domnitor&quot; (ruling prince) after the official unification of the two formerly separate states, being elected prince of both states in 1859. He was deposed in 1866 by a broad coalition of the main political parties, after which parliament offered the throne to Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen who subsequently became the new &quot;Domnitor of Romania&quot; (as Carol I).

Romania&#x27;s independence from the Ottoman Empire was recognized in 1878 by the Treaty of Berlin. In an expression of full sovereignty, the principality was elevated to a kingdom in 1881, with Carol I becoming King of Romania. Carol I died in 1914, and was succeeded by his nephew, Ferdinand I.

In 1927, Ferdinand I died, and the country was left in the care of a regency headed by Prince Nicholas of Romania, during the reign of Ferdinand&#x27;s young grandson, Michael I (who was only six years old at the time), his father (Carol II) having renounced his rights to the throne in 1925. Carol II, unlike Carol I, in the beginning had no desire to rule Romania, and was frequently out of the country exploring the rest of Europe with his mistress. Michael&#x27;s first reign would be short lived at only three years, until his father Carol II came back to contest the title at the behest of a dissatisfied political faction that staged a sudden &#x27;coup d&#x27;état&#x27; (in spite of the fact that only a few years earlier he had renounced in official documents, written and signed in front of his own father, all his future claims to the throne of Romania).

After a ten-year rule, Carol II was forced to give up his crown in the wake of an outcry over the Second Vienna Award, which forced Romania to surrender northern Transylvania to Hungary. After the war, he married his longtime mistress, Elena Lupescu. The couple ultimately settled in Portugal, and the &quot;playboy king&quot; never returned to Romania.

The kingdom of Romania was a constitutional monarchy for most of its existence with the exception of 1938–1944, during the dictatorships of Carol II (1938–1940) and Ion Antonescu (1940–1944). On 23 August 1944, Michael I restored the last democratic royal Constitution of 1923. However, during his second reign (1940–1947), Michael I reigned mostly as an extraconstitutional king, without a parliamentary vote. Parliament was initially suspended and reinstated only later, in 1946. Michael I was crowned and anointed by the Orthodox Patriarch, Nicodim Munteanu, in the Patriarchal Cathedral of Bucharest, on the day of his second accession, 6 September 1940. However, legally, Michael I could not exercise much authority besides some prerogatives such as being the Supreme Head of the Army and designating a plenipotentiary prime minister &quot;Conducător&quot; (&quot;Leader&quot;).

On 23 August 1944, with the Soviet Army already deep inside Romania&#x27;s territory, Michael I deposed the German-allied dictator Ion Antonescu at the urging of the opposition parties and aligned the country with the Allies. Helped by the presence of Soviet forces, communists gradually took control of the administration. On 30 December 1947, King Michael I was forced to sign his abdication. The same day, Parliament proclaimed the country a people&#x27;s republic. The young former king and former queen mother Elena were forced to leave Romania on January 3, 1948, in the royal train, at the request of the communist-dominated government. Royal properties were nationalized later that year.

==Return from exile==

After the Revolution of 1989, the former king visited Romania to an enthusiastic reception in the streets of Bucharest; the royal estates and properties in Romania were restored. However, the country preserved its republican character.

The former king was respected and recognized by the Parliament. His grandson regularly visits different organisations in Romania. Princess Margareta and her husband bestow royal orders in the name of the former king for selected Romanians.

The royal house is still popular and in 2014 Prime Minister Victor Ponta promised a referendum on whether or not to reinstate the monarchy if he were re-elected. A square was named in honour of the ex-king in 2012. Following the death of the former king in 2017, and the largely positive reaction of the crowds to the royal family at his funeral, Romanian politicians have discussed whether to hold a referendum to restore the monarchy, with around half the population (in early 2018) believing monarchy to be a better organisational form than a republic.

<doc id="158560" wikidata="Q1922067" url="?curid=158560" title="President of Turkey">
<text>The president of Turkey, officially the president of the Republic of Türkiye (), is the head of state and head of government of Turkey. The president directs the executive branch of the national government and is the commander-in-chief of the Turkish military. The president also heads the National Security Council.

The office of the president of Turkey was established with the proclamation of the Republic of Türkiye on 29 October 1923, with the first president and founder being Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Traditionally, the presidency was mostly a ceremonial position, with real executive authority being exercised by the prime minister of Turkey. However, constitutional amendments approved in the 2017 constitutional referendum abolished the office of prime minister, and vested the presidency with full executive powers, effective upon the 2018 general election. The president is directly elected by eligible Turkish voters for a five-year term.

The president of Turkey is referred to as (&quot;Republic leader&quot;), and previously archaically as or , also meaning &quot;head of the republic/people&quot;. 

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is the 12th and current president of Turkey, who has held the office since 28 August 2014.

==History==
The office of the President was established with the proclamation of the republic on 29 October 1923. In the voting held on the same day, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was unanimously elected as the first president. From this date until 2014, all presidents except Kenan Evren were elected by the Turkish Grand National Assembly.

Among the former presidents, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, İsmet İnönü and Celâl Bayar served as presidents affiliated with a political party. Atatürk and İnönü continued to serve as both the chairman and the president of the Republican People&#x27;s Party, while Celâl Bayar resigned from the Democrat Party chairmanship when he started his presidency, but continued to be a party member during his presidency.

With the 1961 Constitution made after the 1960 coup, it was decided that presidents should cut off any relation with political parties. Evren, who was governing the country as the head of state and the head of the National Security Council after the 1980 coup, was appointed to the Presidency on 7 November 1982, when the constitution was adopted by popular vote, in accordance with the first provisional article of the 1982 Constitution.

With the 2007 constitutional amendment referendum, it was decided that the president would be elected by the people, and in the first elections held on 10 August 2014 after this change, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was elected president by the people. The president, who is the head of state, is also the head of government after the 2017 constitutional amendment referendum.

==Leadership roles==
===Head of state===
As head of state, the president represents the Turkish government to its own people, and represents the nation to the rest of the world. Insulting the head of state is prohibited by Article 299 of the Turkish Penal Code. 

===Head of party ===
Leaders of political parties are generally expected to run as a presidential candidate for their party. However, they can also decide not to run as a candidate and contribute to the process of nominating other individuals.

From 1961 until 2017, Turkish presidents were required to sever all relations, if any, with their political party. This convention existed to ensure the president&#x27;s impartiality in presiding over the Turkish constitutional system. However, the presidency&#x27;s reorientation in 2017 into a chief executive office abolished this convention, given a president&#x27;s assumption of office as winners of a partisan electoral contest.

===Regional leader===
The presidents of Turkey are widely perceived as regional power due to the country&#x27;s strategic importance, geopolitical influence, economic and military strength, cultural heritage, and historical ties. Their active engagement in regional diplomacy, mediation efforts, humanitarian assistance, and economic cooperation underscores Turkey&#x27;s role as a key player in shaping regional dynamics and promoting stability and prosperity in the broader neighborhood.

==Selection process==
===Eligibility===
 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:
* be a Turkish citizen who is eligible to be a deputy;
* be at least 40 years old;
* have completed higher education.

If a presidential candidate is a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, they must resign their seat due to separation of powers.

===Election===

The principles regarding the election of the President are regulated in Article 101 of the Constitution and in the Presidential Election Law.

In the election to be held by universal suffrage, the candidate who receives the absolute majority of the valid votes is elected president. If this majority is not achieved in the first round, a runoff is held on the second Sunday following this vote. The two candidates who received the most votes in the first ballot participate in this voting and the candidate who receives the majority of the valid votes is elected president. 

If one of the presidential candidates who gains the right to run for the second round is unable to participate in the election for any reason, the second round shall be conducted by substituting the vacant candidacy in conformity with the ranking in the first round. If only one candidate remains for the second round, this ballot shall be then conducted as a referendum. A presidential candidate receives the majority of the valid votes shall be elected as president. If that candidate fails to receive the majority of the valid votes in the election, the presidential election will be scheduled to be renewed.

Before the constitutional amendments approved in the 2007 referendum, the Grand National Assembly would elect one of its members as the President.

===Inauguration===
Before executing the powers of the office, a president is required to recite the presidential Oath of Office, found in . This is the only component in the inauguration ceremony mandated by the Constitution:

The inauguration happens in the Grand National Assembly. The oath is broadcast live on TBMM-TV regardless of it is a regular business day of the Grand National Assembly.

==Incumbency==
===Term limit===
The president is elected for a term of office of five years and is eligible for one re-election. An exception exists when a president&#x27;s term ends with a parliamentary decision (i.e., impeachment and removal from office). In this case, the president may be re-elected for an additional term, with the incomplete term not counting against the two-term limit. 

The term of the incumbent president continues until the president-elect takes office. Before the constitutional amendment approved in the 2007 referendum, the president used to be elected for a single seven-year term.

===Vacancies and successions===
In the event that the office of the President becomes vacant for any reason and there is one year or less before the general election of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, the election of the president is held together with the general election of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey on the first Sunday following the sixtieth day after the vacancy of the office.

In the event that the office of the President becomes vacant for any reason and there is more than one year remaining for the general election of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, the presidential election is held on the last Sunday within forty-five days following the day the office is vacant. The president elected in this way continues his duty until the election date of the Turkish Grand National Assembly. For the president who has completed the remaining term, this period is not counted as a term.

If the elections are not completed, the current president&#x27;s office continues until the new one takes office.

In the event that the Turkish Grand National Assembly decides that it is not possible to hold new elections due to the war, the presidential election is postponed for one year. If the reason for the postponement has not disappeared, this process can be repeated according to the procedure in the postponement decision.

===Accountability and non-accountability===
====After the 2017 constitutional amendment====
2017 constitutional referendum extended the president&#x27;s accountability beyond impeachment due to high treason. According to the constitutional amendments approved in the referendum, the Grand National Assembly may initiate an investigation of the president, the vice president or any member of the Cabinet upon the proposal of simple majority of its total members, and within a period less than a month, the approval of three-fifths of the total members. The investigation would be carried out by a commission of fifteen members of the Assembly, each nominated by the political parties in proportion to their representation therein. The commission would submit its report indicating the outcome of the investigation to the speaker within two months. If the investigation is not completed within this period, the commission&#x27;s time renewed for another month. Within ten days of its submission to the speaker, the report would be distributed to all members of the Assembly, and ten days after its distribution, the report would be discussed on the floor. Upon the approval of two-thirds of the total number of the Assembly by secret vote, the person or persons, about whom the investigation was conducted, may be tried before the Constitutional Court. The trial would be finalized within three months, and if not, a one-time additional period of three months shall be granted.

A president about whom an investigation has been initiated may not call for an election. A president who is convicted by the Court would be removed from office.

The provision of this article shall also apply to the offenses for which the president allegedly worked during his term of office.

====Before the 2017 constitutional amendment====
Before the 2017 constitutional referendum, the president was not accountable for its actions and orders, except for impeachment due to high treason. All presidential decrees, except those which the president is empowered to enact on his own, had to be signed by the prime minister and the minister concerned, in accordance with the provisions of the constitution and other laws. Thus, the prime minister and the concerned ministers were accountable for these decrees, not the president. The decisions and orders signed by the president on his own initiatives may not be appealed to any judicial authority, including the Constitutional Court. The only accountability the president had was impeachment for high treason on the proposal of at least one-third of the total number of the members of the parliament and by the decision of at least three-fourths of the total number of the members.

===Residence=== 

The Presidential Complex in Ankara is the official residence of the president. It was formally inaugurated as the official residence of the president by Erdoğan on the country&#x27;s Republic Day, 29 October 2014. From 1923 to 2014, the Çankaya Mansion served as the residence of the presidents. The serves as the president&#x27;s official guest house and as a secondary residence for the president if needed. The Huber Mansion, the Florya Atatürk Marine Mansion and the Vahdettin Pavilion have been used as presidential workplace or as summer residence.

During the Cold War, at which time an invasion of West Germany was a possibility, Hahn Air Base was a frontline air base, and home of the United States Air Force 50th Tactical Fighter Wing (now the 50th Space Wing), in various designations, as part of the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE). It was one of several USAFE bases in Germany within of each other including Zweibrücken Air Base, Ramstein Air Base, Sembach, Bitburg Air Base, Spangdahlem Air Base, and Rhein-Main Air Base. These air bases were well situated to reach all locations within Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. Hahn Air Base had more than 13,000 people and three squadrons of F-16 tactical fighters. At the end of the Cold War, the United States was left with a huge excess capacity of expensive airfields in Europe.

As a result, the squadrons at the base were inactivated: the 496th Tactical Fighter Squadron was inactivated on 15 May 1991, the 313th Tactical Fighter Squadron was inactivated on 1 July 1991, and the 10th Tactical Fighter Squadron was inactivated on 30 September 1991. The 50th Tactical Fighter Wing was inactivated on 30 September 1991 and then activated as the 50th Space Wing at Falcon AFB (now Schriever Air Force Base) in Colorado on 30 January 1992. The inactivations had a significant effect on the local economy.

Most of Hahn Air Base was turned over to German civil authorities on 30 September 1993, though USAFE retained a small portion as a radio communications site until its final turnover to German authorities in 2012. It is still frequently used for military charters operated by, amongst others, Atlas Air, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines.

The German government decided to turn Hahn Air Base into a civil airport with the goal of reducing traffic to Frankfurt Airport (which is located in the neighbouring state of Hesse). One of the main investors in the development of the airport was Fraport AG, the operator of Frankfurt International Airport, which received a 65% ownership stake in the airport.

In 1996, the faculty and police training school of the Rheinland-Pfalz State Police were combined at a new joint facility located at the air base&#x27;s former housing area.

===Name controversy===
In 2001, Ryanair began flying to the airport, using it as a second base for its European operations. At the request of Ryanair, the name of the airport was officially changed from &quot;Hahn Airport&quot; to &quot;Frankfurt–Hahn Airport&quot;. Lufthansa began legal proceedings against Ryanair in 2002, claiming the usage of &quot;Frankfurt&quot; in the name to be false advertising. Ryanair was allowed to keep the name but was forced to clarify in its advertising that the airport is actually 120 kilometers (75 miles) by road from Frankfurt. In March 2023, the new owners, Triwo, changed the name to &quot;Hahn Airport&quot;.

===Losses and ownership transfers===
In 2003, the airport reported a loss of €17 million, compared to €20 million in 2002.

In 2007, Etihad Cargo switched its German freighter services from Frankfurt International airport to Frankfurt-Hahn airport.

Effective 1 January 2009, Fraport sold its 65% interest in the airport to the government of Rhineland-Palatinate for the symbolic price of €1. The airport had been losing money and Fraport did not want to continue to fund losses. The transaction increased the stake owned by the government to 82.5%. Also in 2009, a cargo flight departing from Hahn using the Antonov 225 made the world record for the heaviest single piece of air cargo, a 189.98 tonne generator for a Fossil-fuel power station in Armenia.

In 2013, Etihad Cargo, a major customer of the airport, announced the relocation of its cargo operations from Hahn to Frankfurt Airport.

In January 2014, the airport announced it had accumulated debts of €125 million while passenger and cargo traffic were decreasing. The same year, the government pledged €80 million to the airport so that it would avoid bankruptcy. In February 2014, security staff at the airport initiated a strike action.
In the summer of 2014, Ryanair reduced capacity on several routes for and removed 3 of 9 aircraft based at the airport.

In March 2015, Yangtze River Express, the largest freight customer of the airport with 4 cargo destinations and accounting for 50,000 of the airport&#x27;s 130,000 tons of annual volume, announced it would cease its cargo operations at Frankfurt–Hahn Airport in favor of Munich Airport. Months earlier, Qatar Airways and Aeroflot had also ceased their cargo operations at the airport.

In June 2016, the cargo subsidiary of Air France–KLM announced it would shut down its cargo reloading point at the airport, which was used to collect freight and transfer it to Paris by truck. In August 2016, RAF-Avia from Latvia announced basing two aircraft at the airport to operate ad-hoc charter flights. Also in June 2016, the government of Rhineland-Palatinate announced the sale of its 82.5% interest in the airport to Shanghai Yiqian Trading Company. However, the deal fell apart a month later after the buyer failed to get approval to make the payment.

In 2017, Suparna, formerly known as Yangtze River Express, began operating a 747-400F at the airport and AirBridgeCargo and Etihad also expanded cargo operations. In August 2017, HNA Group, a Fortune Global 500 company based in China acquired the 82.5% stake in the airport owned by the government of Rhineland-Palatinate for €15.1 million. In conjunction with the acquisition, the European Commission agreed to cover up to €25.3 million of losses between 2017 and 2021 while HNA makes improvements to the airport.

In February 2018, Ryanair announced the shift of part of its operations from Hahn to Frankfurt Airport, where it opened a base in 2017. One of five aircraft were moved to Frankfurt Airport and four routes were cut at Frankfurt-Hahn. A year later, Ryanair announced further major cuts with a reduction to just 16 routes — from over 40 in earlier years — for the 2019/2020 winter season. In July 2020, Ryanair announced plans to close their Hahn base by November 2020 after a labour union dispute. Hahn has been Ryanair&#x27;s second base in continental Europe, inaugurated in 2002. However, as of September 2020, no final decision had been made.

The airport filed for bankruptcy on 19 October 2021 while continuing normal operations. In June 2022, it was sold to a German investor, which however did not transfer the agreed sales price by late 2022 raising doubt about the airport&#x27;s future again. Shortly after, the administrator signed preliminary contracts with two new potential buyers, one of them being the owner of nearby Nürburgring. If the purchase is approved, the new owner of the airport will be NR Holding, owned by Russian billionaire Viktor Kharitonin, a major figure in the Russian pharmaceutical industry. The purchase price is 20 million euros.

In April 2023, the administrator announced that the airport had been sold to the Trier-based company Triwo, which already owns and operates several smaller airports. The sale was subject to conditions from the time of the announcement until its definitive closing around 20 April 2023. Triwo AG has officially been the owner of the airport company TRIWO Hahn Airport GmbH since May 2023.

==Infrastructure==
===Terminals===
The airport consists of two passenger terminals and one cargo terminal. The passenger terminals, designated A and B, include shops and restaurants including a McDonald&#x27;s. The apron has 11 stands for mid-sized aircraft, such as the Boeing 737, which are reached on foot. The cargo apron has three stands for large aircraft such as the Boeing 747-8F.

===Runway===
Frankfurt–Hahn has a long runway of in the direction of 03/21. This, combined with a large apron, allows it to handle some of the world&#x27;s biggest aircraft, such as the Antonov An-124 or the Boeing Dreamlifter. While the Antonov is a frequent visitor, the Dreamlifter has only landed twice at the airport, both times in 2010. An Instrument Landing System is available, with runway 21 being category 3 approved; low-visibility conditions are a frequent problem at the airport, especially in autumn and winter.

==Airlines and destinations==

<doc id="158568" wikidata="Q701317" url="?curid=158568" title="Martian Successor Nadesico">
<text>, sometimes referred to as simply , is a Japanese anime television series produced by TV Tokyo, Yomiko Advertising and Xebec and directed by Tatsuo Satō, with manga artist Kia Asamiya providing original character designs, Keiji Gotoh serving as chief animation director, Mika Akitaka being the main mechanical designer and Takayuki Hattori composing the music. A manga adaptation by Asamiya was published by Kadokawa Shoten from 1996 to 1999. The manga, licensed in North America by CPM Manga, has many significant changes from the anime.

The series aired from October 1, 1996, to March 24, 1997, with a total of 26 episodes, and was replaced by the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime in its timeslot.

In 2005, Anime News Network reported that plans for &quot;Nadesico 2&quot; were scrapped, citing an entry on &quot;Stellvia&quot; director Tatsuo Sato&#x27;s blog.

==Plot==

The series takes place in the year 2196. Earth is at war with a race of alien invaders called the &quot;Jovian Lizards&quot;. A company called Nergal Heavy Industries designs a space battleship, the &quot;ND-001 Nadesico&quot;. While the ship is powerful and its crew consists of the top civilian experts in their fields, these individuals tend to have &quot;some slight personality disorders&quot;.

The primary protagonist, Akito Tenkawa, is a boy with a mysterious past; once a resident of Mars&#x27; Utopia colony, he escaped its destruction by the Jovian Lizards and arrived on Earth, with no memory of how he got there but a terrible fear of the invaders. He hates fighting and only wants to be a chef. However, he is constantly called on to act as a pilot of one of the &quot;Nadesico&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Aestivalis&quot; - humanoid combat robots. While on board the &quot;Nadesico&quot;, Akito has more problems to deal with than just the Jovians; nearly all the female members of the crew, especially the vessel&#x27;s captain Yurika Misumaru, seem to be head over heels in love with him, though all he wants to do is cook and watch his favorite anime, &quot;Gekiganger III&quot;.

==Production==
The series features an energetic juxtaposition of comedy and drama, as the characters engage in lighthearted antics in between facing the drama of war. Many of the characters are themselves anime fans, and there is often comparison between the campy, sanitized war of the anime within an anime &quot;Gekigangar III&quot; and the much harsher reality that the crew of the &quot;Nadesico&quot; faces. The show intentionally includes a number of science fiction anime clichés, including time travel and alien invaders, but turns these concepts on their heads by the end of the series through a number of plot twists.

The show has been also described as a space opera.

There are many anime references, particularly to the series &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; (the name &quot;Nadesico&quot; is a play on the phrase &quot;Yamato nadeshiko&quot;, which represents the traditional Japanese ideal of femininity, and also the name of a flower). One of the characters was a voice actress before joining the crew (and in fact is a parody of a specific voice actress, Megumi Hayashibara), another is a fangirl who likes to draw her own shōnen-ai doujinshi, and a third is an otaku who bases his entire life on &quot;Gekigangar III&quot;.

In an episode late in the series, the ship holds an anime convention complete with a viewing marathon of &quot;Gekigangar&quot;, people engaged in cosplay, and tie-in merchandising. Another episode makes a parody of the &quot;Macross&quot; anime, as the crew celebrates a Miss Nadesico contest to decide a on new captain and public figurehead, in which all the female crew members participate. The contest includes a swimsuit competition and singing.

The &quot;Gekigangar&quot; anime show is in fact an homage (and parody) of many super robot mecha anime of the 1970s and 1980s, most particularly the Go Nagai/Ken Ishikawa collaboration &quot;Getter Robo&quot;. The battles between Earth and planetary colonies featured throughout the show is a reference to &quot;Gundam&quot;, while the assortment of odd-ball characters on the ship who prefer to choose their own battles, rather than take sides, is a nod to Harlock. In addition, writers from previous popular science fiction mecha shows occasionally get announced in teasers for various episodes of &quot;Nadesico&quot;.

==Media==

===Anime===

The &quot;Martian Successor Nadesico&quot; anime was directed by Tatsuo Sato and produced by TV Tokyo, Xebec, and Yomiko Advertising, Inc. The series aired on the Bandai Channel and TV Tokyo from November 1, 1996, to March 24, 1997. ADV Films announced they had licensed &quot;Martian Successor Nadesico&quot; in May 1998 at Project A-Kon 9; the company released the series originally on 12 VHS tapes. Later, the series was released on a total of six DVDs. On September 24, 2002, ADV Films released a box set containing all of the DVDs entitled &quot;Martian Successor Nadesico: Complete Chronicles&quot; and, on January 1, 2008, a collection of all the episodes entitled &quot;Martian Successor Nadesico: Perfect Collection&quot;. At Anime Expo 2011, Nozomi Entertainment announced that they had re-licensed the series, following ADV&#x27;s closure in 2009. They re-released the series, along with the movie and the &quot;Gekiganger III&quot; OVA, in 2012. Anime Limited later acquired the series in 2017 on Blu-ray.

&quot;Martian Successor Nadesico&quot;″s opening song is &quot;You Get to Burning&quot; by Yumi Matsuzawa. The main ending song is by Houko Kuwashima, with episode 26 featuring by Kazumi Matsumura as its ending.

Four games based on the series were released in Japan. The first game, released for the Sega Saturn in 1997, is entitled &quot;Mobile Battleship Nadesico&quot;. It is a dating sim game with a few mecha elements included. A second game, also for the Sega Saturn, was released in the following year under the title &quot;Martian Successor Nadesico: The Blank of Three Years&quot;. It is an interactive story of the events which occurred in between the television series and the movie. Released on the Dreamcast in 1999, &quot;Martian Successor Nadesico: The Mission&quot;, continues the story from &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;. Finally, a mahjong variant game was released for the Game Boy Color entitled &quot;Mobile Battleship Nadesico: Ruriruri Mahjong&quot;. &quot;Nadesico&quot; also appears in games in the Super Robot Wars and Another Century&#x27;s series, where the setting is combined with other mecha series&#x27; such as &quot;Gundam&quot;, &quot;Mazinger&quot;, &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot;, and &quot;Tekkaman Blade&quot;.

==Reception==
There have been mixed reviews to the series, although most reviews have been positive. One review written when the series was released on DVD gave it average ratings, commenting that while the show was dubbed into English poorly, it commented positively on the use of characters saying, &quot;Despite his heroic calling as a robot pilot, Akito is remarkably approachable—after all, what could be more down-to-earth than a cook? Yurika, the world&#x27;s most unlikely starship captain, may seem like a troublesome ditz at first, but demonstrates resolve and emotional depth as she learns the art of leadership. The characters may be billed as goofballs, but they also provide some of the most touching moments in the show. The &quot;Nadesico&quot; mindset shows that heroism and self-sacrifice are still respectable virtues, and that nobody needs to hear whining about why you can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t pilot a giant robot.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Charles Solomon praised the series, calling its action and hi-jinks on par with &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;.

Other reviews have been generally positive, with one saying, &quot;&quot;Nadesico&quot; is one of those rare series that has something for everyone. Comedy, action, romance, drama...you name it, this series has it (well, almost). What&#x27;s even more astonishing is that &quot;Nadesico&quot; keeps everything tied together in a neat little coherent package, so much so that you&#x27;ll hardly even notice the blend of genres. It&#x27;s a pretty cool little package, too.&quot; Another review praised the English dub, saying &quot;I first watched this show multiple times in Japanese, but eventually gave the English dub a try and found I loved it. The cast is excellent, with Jennifer Earhart&#x27;s Yurika being especially noteworthy. Even minor characters, such as a Jovian pilot played by Jason Douglas, give great performances. His reading of &#x27;If only the humans appreciated life as we do, I would not have to kill so many of them&#x27; is brilliant.&quot;

The series quickly became popular. The film won the &quot;Animage&quot; Grand Prix award in 1998. In other polls conducted by &quot;Animage&quot; in the same year, Akito was voted the ninth most &quot;Favorite Male Character of the Year&quot;, Ruri Hoshino was voted second and Yurika eighth most &quot;Favorite Female Characters of the Year&quot; and the TV series was vote the third &quot;Favorite Anime of the Year&quot;.

<doc id="158571" wikidata="Q316022" url="?curid=158571" title="Harry Nyquist">
<text>Harry Nyquist (, ; February 7, 1889 – April 4, 1976) was a Swedish-American physicist and electronic engineer who made important contributions to communication theory.

==Personal life==
Nyquist was born in the village Nilsby of the parish Stora Kil, Värmland, Sweden. He was the son of Lars Jonsson Nyqvist (1847–1930) and Catarina (or Katrina) Eriksdotter (1857–1920). His parents had eight children: Elin Teresia, Astrid, Selma, Harry Theodor, Amelie, Olga Maria, Axel Martin and Herta Alfrida. He immigrated to the United States in 1907.

==Education==
He entered the University of North Dakota in 1912 and received B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering in 1914 and 1915, respectively. He received a Ph.D. in physics at Yale University in 1917.

==Career==
He worked at AT&amp;T&#x27;s Department of Development and Research from 1917 to 1934, and continued when it became Bell Telephone Laboratories that year, until his retirement in 1954.

Nyquist received the IRE Medal of Honor in 1960 for &quot;fundamental contributions to a quantitative understanding of thermal noise, data transmission and negative feedback.&quot; 
In October 1960 he was awarded the Stuart Ballantine Medal of the Franklin Institute &quot;for his theoretical analyses and practical inventions in the field of communications systems during the past forty years including, particularly, his original work in the theories of telegraph transmission, thermal noise in electric conductors, and in the history of feedback systems.&quot; 
In 1969 he was awarded the National Academy of Engineering&#x27;s fourth Founder&#x27;s Medal &quot;in recognition of his many fundamental contributions to engineering.&quot;
In 1975 Nyquist received together with Hendrik Bode the Rufus Oldenburger Medal from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

As reported in &quot;The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation&quot;, the Bell Labs patent lawyers wanted to know why some people were so much more productive (in terms of patents) than others. After crunching a lot of data, they found that the only thing the productive employees had in common (other than having made it through the Bell Labs hiring process) was that &quot;Workers with the most patents often shared lunch or breakfast with a Bell Labs electrical engineer named Harry Nyquist. It wasn&#x27;t the case that Nyquist gave them specific ideas. Rather, as one scientist recalled, &#x27;he drew people out, got them thinking&#x27;&quot; (p. 135).

Nyquist lived in Pharr, Texas after his retirement, and died in Harlingen, Texas on April 4, 1976.

== Technical contributions==
As an engineer at Bell Laboratories, Nyquist did important work on thermal noise (&quot;Johnson–Nyquist noise&quot;), the stability of feedback amplifiers, telegraphy, facsimile, television, and other important communications problems. With Herbert E. Ives, he helped to develop AT&amp;T&#x27;s first facsimile machines that were made public in 1924. In 1932, he published a classic paper on stability of feedback amplifiers. The Nyquist stability criterion can now be found in many textbooks on feedback control theory.

His early theoretical work on determining the bandwidth requirements for transmitting information laid the foundations for later advances by Claude Shannon, which led to the development of information theory. In particular, Nyquist determined that the number of independent pulses that could be put through a telegraph channel per unit time is limited to twice the bandwidth of the channel, and published his results in the papers &quot;Certain factors affecting telegraph speed&quot; (1924) and &quot;Certain topics in Telegraph Transmission Theory&quot; (1928). This rule is essentially a dual of what is now known as the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem.

==Terms named for Harry Nyquist==
* Nyquist rate: sampling rate twice the bandwidth of the signal&#x27;s waveform being sampled; sampling at a rate that is equal to, or faster, than this rate ensures that the waveform can be reconstructed accurately.
* Nyquist frequency: half the sample rate of a system; signal frequencies below this value are unambiguously represented.
* Nyquist filter
* Nyquist plot
* Nyquist ISI criterion
* Nyquist (programming language)
* Nyquist stability criterion

<doc id="158573" wikidata="Q5514687" url="?curid=158573" title="Food drying">
<text>Food drying is a method of food preservation in which food is dried (dehydrated or desiccated). Drying inhibits the growth of bacteria, yeasts, and mold through the removal of water. Dehydration has been used widely for this purpose since ancient times; the earliest known practice is 12,000 B.C. by inhabitants of the modern Asian and Middle Eastern regions. Water is traditionally removed through evaporation by using methods such as air drying, sun drying, smoking or wind drying, although today electric food dehydrators or freeze-drying can be used to speed the drying process and ensure more consistent results.
== Food types ==

Many different foods can be prepared by dehydration. Meat has held a historically significant role. For centuries, much of the European diet depended on dried cod—known as salt cod, bacalhau (with salt), or stockfish (without). It formed the main protein source for the slaves on the West Indian plantations, and was a major economic force within the triangular trade. Dried fish most commonly cod or haddock, known as Harðfiskur, is a delicacy in Iceland, while dried reindeer meat is a traditional Sámi food. Dried meats include prosciutto (Parma ham), bresaola, biltong and beef jerky.

Dried fruits have been consumed historically due to their high sugar content and sweet taste, and a longer shelf-life from drying. Fruits may be used and named differently when dried. The plum becomes a prune, the grape a raisin. Figs and dates may be transformed into different products that can either be eaten as they are, used in recipes, or rehydrated.

Freeze-dried vegetables are often found in food for backpackers, hunters, and the military. Garlic and onion are often dried and stored with their stalks braided. Edible mushrooms are sometimes dried for preservation or to be used as seasonings.

== Preparation ==
Home drying of vegetables, fruit and meat can be carried out with electrical dehydrators (household appliance) or by sun-drying or by wind. Preservatives such as potassium metabisulfite, BHA, or BHT may be used, but are not required. However, dried products without these preservatives may require refrigeration or freezing to ensure safe storage for a long time.

Industrial food dehydration is often accomplished by freeze-drying. In this case, food is flash frozen and put into a reduced-pressure system which causes the water to sublimate directly from the solid to the gaseous phase. Although freeze-drying is more expensive than traditional dehydration techniques, it also mitigates the change in flavor, texture, and nutritional value. In addition, another widely used industrial method of drying of food is convective hot air drying. Industrial hot air dryers are simple and easy to design, construct and maintain. More so, it is very affordable and has been reported to retain most of the nutritional properties of food if dried using appropriate drying conditions.

Hurdle technology is the combination of multiple food preservation methods. Hurdle technology uses low doses of multiple food preservation techniques in order to ensure food is not only safe but is desirable visually and texturally.

== Packaging ==
Packaging ensures effective food preservation. Some methods of packaging that are beneficial to dehydrated food are vacuum sealed, inert gases, or gases that help regulate respiration, biological organisms, and growth of microorganisms.

== Other methods ==

There are many different methods for drying, each with its own advantages for particular applications. These include:

* Convection drying
* Bed dryers
* Drum drying
* Freeze drying
* Microwave-vacuum drying
* Shelf dryers
* Spray drying
* Infrared radiation drying
* Combined thermal hybrid drying
* Sunlight
* Commercial food dehydrators
* Household oven

<text>MAE-West was an Internet exchange point located on the west coast of the United States in Silicon Valley, in the south San Francisco Bay Area in California. It was established in November, 1994. Its name officially stands for &quot;Metropolitan Area Exchange, West&quot;, although it was a humorous reference to the name of the actress Mae West and to the original MAE in the Washington DC metro area, which was thereafter known as &quot;MAE-East.&quot;

The exchange was a dual Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) ring, bridged between two locations, one in downtown San Jose, operated by Metropolitan Fiber Systems (MFS) and catering principally to smaller networks, and the second operated by NASA at Moffett Field, to the northwest, and catering principally to larger networks, since it had annual terms (rather than the monthly terms and service level agreement available at the MFS location) and more restrictive access policies. The MFS side was constructed by Steven Feldman, and the NASA side by Bobby Cates and Lance Tatman.

Its San Jose facility was housed in the Market Post Tower. Built in 1985, Market Post Tower, also known as the Gold Building, is a 15-story building located at 55 South Market at the corner Post Street in downtown San Jose, California.

According to its website, &quot;MAE West is interconnected with the Ames Internet Exchange, operated by NASA at the Ames Research Center. This connection is currently two OC3c circuits directly between the FDDI switches at each end.&quot;

In the 1990s, MAE-West was operated by MCI Worldcom and was the second-busiest exchange point on the internet, handling, by some estimates, as much as 40% of the nation&#x27;s Internet traffic.

<text>Zamboanga (also Zamboaŋga) was a province of the Philippines located in the western region of the southern island of Mindanao, Philippines.

==History==
===Creation===

During the time of the United States&#x27; purchase of the Philippines (1898), the Republic of Zamboanga had its own independence and jurisdiction on what is now Zamboanga City. After the dissolution of the republic, Zamboanga was eventually consolidated into one major administrative area by the American government of the Philippines, consisting of an enormous region that was the Mindanao island&#x27;s western peninsula, Basilan Island, and the entire Sulu archipelago, with the ancient namesake town/fort of Zamboanga as the seat of its government, and was called the Moro Province of the Philippines.

The Moro Province, in 1914 was replaced by the Department of Mindanao and Sulu. It was divided into Zamboanga, Sulu, Cotabato, Davao, Agusan and Surigao. The town of Zamboanga as its capital. Luis Lim was appointed as the first governor of Zamboanga.

In 1920, the Department of Mindanao and Sulu was officially dissolved and Zamboanga became an independent province. In 1922, elections were held for the first elected provincial officials of Zamboanga. Florentino Saguin was elected as first elected governor.

At that time, the province was composed of five municipalities:
*Dipolog
*Dapitan
*Lubungan
*Isabela
*Zamboanga

Zamboanga was also sub-divided into 12 municipal districts:
*Bangaan
*Dinas
*Kabasalan
*Kumalarang
*Lamitan
*Maluso
*Margosatubig
*Panganuran
*Sibuko
*Sindangan
*Sirawai
*Taluksangay

===World War II===
When the Japanese invaded the Philippines, Zamboanga acting Governor Felipe Azcuna moved the capital from Zamboanga City to Dipolog. After the defeat of the American-Filipino forces in Corregidor, most of the province went under Japanese control.

After the war, on June 16, 1948, Molave was designated as Zamboanga&#x27;s capital by the virtue of Republic Act No. 286 signed by President Elpidio Quirino.

===Division===
On June 6, 1952, the Republic Act 711, authored by Zamboanga Congressman Roseller Lim was passed by the Philippine House of Representatives to divide the province of Zamboanga to Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur, while the chartered City of Zamboanga and Basilan became part of Zamboanga del Sur . The bill was signed by President Elpidio Quirino in a ceremony held at the Malacañan Palace.

The towns of Dapitan, Dipolog, Rizal, New Piñan, Polanco, Katipunan, Manukan, Sindangan, Liloy, Labason and Siocon are composed of the province of Zamboanga del Norte. The City of Zamboanga &amp; Island of Basilan and towns of Molave, Pagadian, Labangan, Margosatubig, Dimataling, Dinas, Ipil, Buug, Malangas, Kabasalan and Aurora are under Zamboanga del Sur.

The town of Dipolog was designated capital of Zamboanga del Norte and the town of Pagadian as Zamboanga del Sur&#x27;s capital.

In 2001, a brand new Zamboanga province, Zamboanga Sibugay, was created from the province of Zamboanga del Sur with Ipil as its provincial capital.

<doc id="158585" wikidata="Q18225473" url="?curid=158585" title="YuYu Hakusho">
<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. It tells the story of Yusuke Urameshi, a teenage delinquent who is struck and killed by a car while saving a child&#x27;s life. After several tests presented to him by Koenma, the son of the ruler of the afterlife, Yusuke is revived and appointed the title of &quot;Underworld Detective&quot;. With this title, he must investigate various cases involving demons and apparitions in the Human World, with the manga gradually becoming more focused on martial arts battles and tournaments as it progresses. Togashi began creating &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; around November 1990, basing the series on his interests in the occult and horror films and an influence of Buddhist mythology.

The manga was originally serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from December 1990 to July 1994. It consists of 175 chapters collected in 19 volumes. In North America, the manga is licensed by Viz Media, who first serialized it in &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; from January 2003 to January 2010. An anime adaptation consisting of 112 television episodes was directed by Noriyuki Abe and co-produced by Fuji Television, Yomiko Advertising, and Studio Pierrot. The anime series originally aired on Japan&#x27;s Fuji TV network from October 1992 to December 1994 and was later licensed in North America by Funimation in 2001, where it aired on Cartoon Network blocks including Adult Swim and later Toonami. The series has also been published and broadcast in various other countries worldwide. The &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; franchise has spawned two animated films, a series of original video animations (OVAs), a live-action television series, audio albums, video games, and other merchandise.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

&quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; has been well received; the manga has over 50 million copies in circulation worldwide, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. It also won the 39th Shogakukan Manga Award for the category in 1993. The animated series won the &quot;Animage&quot; Anime Grand Prix prize for best anime in 1994 and 1995. The series has been well received by a large audience in Japan and a wide range of age groups in the United States. The anime has been given mostly positive reviews by critics in North America, complimenting its writing, characters, comedy, and amount of action.

==Plot==

&quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; follows Yusuke Urameshi, a 14-year-old street-brawling delinquent who, in an uncharacteristic act of altruism, is hit by a car and killed in an attempt to save a young boy by pushing him out of the way. His ghost is greeted by Botan, a woman who introduces herself as the pilot of the Sanzu River, who ferries souls to the where they may be judged for the afterlife. Botan informs Yusuke that his act had caught even the Underworld by surprise and that there was not yet a place made for him in either heaven or hell. Thus Koenma, son of the Underworld&#x27;s ruler King Enma, offers Yusuke a chance to return to his body through a series of tests. Yusuke succeeds with the help of his friends Keiko Yukimura and Kazuma Kuwabara. After returning to life, Koenma grants Yusuke the title of , charging him with investigating supernatural activity within the . Soon Yusuke is off on his first case, retrieving three treasures stolen from the Underworld by a gang of demons: Hiei, Kurama, and Goki. Yusuke collects the three treasures with the aid of his new technique, the Rei Gun, a shot of aura or fired mentally from his index finger. He then travels to the mountains in search of the aged, female martial arts master Genkai. Together with his rival Kuwabara, Yusuke fights through a tournament organized by Genkai to find her successor. Yusuke uses the competition as a cover to search for Rando, a demon who steals the techniques of martial arts masters and kills them. Yusuke defeats Rando in the final round of the tournament and trains with Genkai for several months, gaining more mastery over his aura. Yusuke is then sent to Labyrinth Castle in the , a third world occupied solely by demons, where Kuwabara and the newly reformed Kurama and Hiei assist him in defeating the Four Beasts, a quartet of demons attempting to blackmail Koenma into removing the barrier keeping them out of the Human World.

Yusuke&#x27;s next case sends him on a rescue mission, where he meets Toguro, a human turned into a demon. To test his strength, Toguro invites Yusuke to the , an event put on by corrupt, rich humans in which teams of demons, and occasionally humans, fight fierce battles for the chance to receive any wish they desire. Team Urameshi, consisting of Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei, and a disguised Genkai, traverses through the strenuous early rounds to face Team Toguro in the finals and win the tournament. They learn that Team Toguro&#x27;s owner, Sakyo, was attempting to win to create a large hole from the Human World to the Demon Plane and allow countless demons through. With his loss, Sakyo destroys the tournament arena, killing himself in the process.

After the tournament, Yusuke returns home but has little time to rest as he is challenged to a fight by three teenagers possessing superhuman powers who take the detective hostage. Kuwabara and the others rescue him and learn that the scenario was a test from Genkai. It is disclosed that Shinobu Sensui, Yusuke&#x27;s predecessor as Underworld Detective, has recruited six other powerful beings to help him take over where Sakyo left off, opening a hole to the Demon Plane to cause genocide of the human race. Yusuke and his friends challenge and defeat Sensui&#x27;s associates individually, culminating in a final battle between the two detectives. Sensui kills Yusuke and then retreats into the newly opened portal to the Demon Plane. Yusuke is reborn as a partial demon, discovering that his ancestor passed down a recessive gene that would hide until an heir with sufficient power surfaced when his demonic lineage would be revealed. Yusuke travels to the Demon Plane and defeats Sensui with the aid of his ancestor who takes control of Yusuke&#x27;s body to finish the fight.

As they return to the Human World, Yusuke is stripped of his detective title in fear that Yusuke&#x27;s demon blood could cause him to go on a rampage in the Human World. Yusuke, unsettled at having been controlled by his ancestor Raizen, accepts an offer by Raizen&#x27;s followers to return to the Demon Plane. Raizen, desiring a successor to his territory, is on the brink of dying of starvation, a death that would topple the delicate political balance of the three ruling powers of the Demon Plane. The other two rulers Mukuro and Yomi summon Hiei and Kurama, respectively, to prepare for an inevitable war. The three protagonists train in the realm for one year, during which time Raizen dies and Yusuke inherits his territory. Yusuke takes the initiative and proposes a fighting tournament to name the Demon Plane&#x27;s true ruler; Mukuro and Yomi agree to Yusuke&#x27;s terms. During the tournament, Yusuke and Yomi meet in the second elimination round where Yusuke is defeated. Yusuke hopes a similar competition will be held every few years to determine the Demon Plane&#x27;s ruler. 

Two years later, Yusuke returns to the Human World while Hiei stays with Mukuro and protects humans who have accidentally wandered into the Demon Plane. After learning that King Enma was falsifying reports on demon activity against humans in order to justify keeping the two separated, Koenma takes over his father&#x27;s position and allows access between the Demon Plane and the Human World. Genkai dies and leaves her estate to the main characters. The story ends with Yusuke and his friends reuniting at a beach.

==Production==
Author Yoshihiro Togashi stated that he began working on &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; around November 1990, though he forgot the exact time. He had recently completed the serialization of his romantic comedy &quot;Ten de Shōwaru Cupid&quot; in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;. Having felt somewhat intimidated by some of his more popular fellow authors during this manga&#x27;s run, Togashi realized he would need to create a fighting manga to both gain popularity and write something he enjoyed. As a fan of the occult and horror films, he desired to write and illustrate a new manga based on his interests. Togashi had previously published an occult detective fiction manga titled &quot;Occult Tanteidan&quot;, of which he referenced positive reception from readers as a reason for continuing to create manga. When first producing &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;, he did not have a clear idea of what he wanted to call it. He used the tentative title &quot;How to be a Ghost&quot; while presenting rough drafts to his editors. Once given the go-ahead to begin publication, Togashi proposed &quot;YuYu-Ki&quot; (Poltergeist Chronicles) for the title, as there would be battles with demons and it would be a play on the title &quot;SaiYu-Ki&quot;. However, a series with a similar name (&quot;Chin-Yu-Ki&quot;) had already begun publication, so Togashi quickly created an alternative: &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; (Poltergeist Report). He commented that he could have used &quot;Den&quot; (Legend) or &quot;Monogatari&quot; (Story), but &quot;Hakusho&quot; (Report) was the first thing that came to his mind. He contiguously developed the names of the main characters by skimming through a dictionary and taking out kanji characters he found appealing. &quot;Yusuke Urameshi&quot; is a pun, &quot;Kazuma Kuwabara&quot; is a combination of two professional baseball players, and &quot;Hiei&quot; and &quot;Kurama&quot; are &quot;just names that popped into [Togashi&#x27;s] head.&quot; When he introduced the latter two characters in volume three, the author had early plans to make Kurama a main character but was not certain about Hiei.

The manga&#x27;s shift from occult detective fiction to the martial arts genre after Yusuke&#x27;s death and revival in the early chapters was planned by Togashi from the beginning. He took this idea from the series &quot;Kinnikuman&quot;, which began largely as a comedy before concentrating more on action. Togashi intended to establish the main characters and familiarize the reader with them before placing them in tense, physical conflicts. His editor at the time was nervous about him beginning the manga this way and recommended he transition to a battle-focused plot after about 30 chapters. &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; borrows many elements from Asian folklore, particularly Buddhist beliefs in the afterlife. Togashi came up with the concept of the &quot;Ningenkai&quot; (Human World), &quot;Reikai&quot; (Underworld), and &quot;Makai&quot; (Demon Plane) as being parallel planes of existence in the manga&#x27;s universe. He thought of them as places that one could not easily travel between using modern technology, but rather as a spirit lacking a material body. However, the idea for the &quot;territory&quot; powers from the Sensui story arc was parodied from a separate, unnamed work by Yasutaka Tsutsui. For his drawing materials, Togashi used drafting ink and &quot;Kabura&quot; pens throughout the creation of the series. While his style of artwork began with screentone, he gradually developed into minimalism. As the series progressed, he would draw figures and faces very detailed or &quot;cartoony, sketchy and jumping with action&quot; whenever he desired such effects.

During the years he worked on &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;, Togashi would calculate the personal time he had based on a formula of four hours per page without scripting and five hours of sleep per night. He wrote in his own dōjinshi &quot;Yoshirin de Pon!&quot; that he stopped the production on &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; out of selfishness. The author had originally wanted to end the manga in December 1993, at the climax of the Sensui arc. Although there was not a great demand from the editorial staff, Togashi was under a great deal of personal stress at certain points of the series&#x27; run, particularly during its final six months of publication. He claimed that beginning with the Dark Tournament arc, inconsistent sleep resulting from overwork was causing him health problems. He noted he was very ill while working on the color pages for Yusuke&#x27;s match with Chu. There were many instances where he would create nearly entire manuscripts by himself, such as Yusuke&#x27;s meeting with Raizen and the battle between Kurama and Karasu. The publication&#x27;s editors tried to make Togashi reconsider canceling &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot;, though he justified his decision by stating that it would simply be replaced by another popular series. Togashi was relieved at the conclusion of the manga. The author claimed he was not involved in the production of the &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; anime adaptation due to his work schedule. He stated that he was greatly impressed by Shigeru Chiba&#x27;s voice depiction of Kuwabara, admitting that the actor understood the character better than Togashi himself.

==Media==
===Manga===

The &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; manga series was written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi and originally serialized by Shueisha in the manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from December 3, 1990, to July 25, 1994. The manga consists of 175 chapters spanning 19 with the first one being released on April 10, 1991, and the last one released on December 12, 1994. Between August 4, 2004, and March 4, 2005, Shueisha released the (complete) editions of the manga. Each of the 15 &quot;kanzenban&quot; volumes features a new cover and more chapters than the &quot;tankōbon&quot; edition. &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; has also been published as part of the &quot;Shueisha Jump Remix&quot; series of magazine-style books. Nine volumes were released between December 22, 2008, and April 27, 2009. A version began publication on November 18, 2010, and was finished on October 18, 2011.

An English translation of the &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; manga was serialized in North America by Viz Media in the American &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; magazine, where it debuted in its inaugural January 2003 issue and ended in January 2010. Viz released all 19 collected volumes of the English manga between May 1, 2003, and March 2, 2010. A total of 176 chapters exist in this format due to Viz treating the extra non-numbered chapter &quot;YuYu Hakusho Tales: Two Shot&quot; found in volume seven (which tells the story of how Hiei and Kurama first met) as the 64th chapter. Viz later re-released the series digitally as part of their digital manga releases between August 20, 2013, and February 25, 2014, and later added it to ComiXology&#x27;s digital releases. The &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; manga has additionally been licensed and published across Asia and Europe. A French translation from Kana, for example, began publication in 1997.

===Anime===

The &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; anime adaptation was directed by Noriyuki Abe and co-produced by Fuji Television, Yomiko Advertising, and Studio Pierrot. The series, consisting of 112 episodes, aired from October 10, 1992, to December 17, 1994, on Fuji Television. The episodes were released on 23 video cassettes by Pony Canyon from January 1, 1995, to December 6, 1995. They were also released on 28 DVD volumes by Beam Entertainment, with volumes 8–14 released on March 25, 2002, volumes 15–21 released on April 25, 2002, and volumes 22–28 released on May 25, 2002. The anime differed from its manga source material by containing different levels of violence and profanity, as well as minor variations in art style from one to the other. In early 2001, the series was acquired by Funimation Entertainment for North American distribution as &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files&quot;. Funimation&#x27;s production saw a significant contribution from voice actor Justin Cook, who not only directed the dub but also voiced the protagonist Yusuke.

The American-produced English dubbed episodes aired from February 23, 2002, to April 1, 2006, on Cartoon Network. Initially, the series was shown on the channel&#x27;s Adult Swim programming block from February 2002 to April 2003, but was later moved to Toonami. Some of the show&#x27;s original depictions of mature content including violence, sexual humor, and coarse language, as well as some controversial cultural discrepancies were edited out for broadcast. &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; was taken off Toonami around March 2005 and moved to an early Saturday morning time slot that October where the series finished its run. It was also aired uncut as part of the Funimation programming block on Colours TV in 2006 and the Funimation Channel in high-definition in 2011. Following Sony&#x27;s acquisition of Crunchyroll, the series was moved to Crunchyroll.

The series was distributed in the United Kingdom by MVM Films and in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment. In India the English-language version of the series was released as &quot;Ghost Fighter&quot;. &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; was localized in the Philippines as &quot;Ghost Fighter&quot; and aired on IBC in the mid-1990s, as well as on GMA Network in 1999. This version of the dub localized the characters&#x27; names, such as changing &quot;Yusuke&quot; to &quot;Eugene&quot;.

Funimation separated the series into four &quot;seasons&quot;, that each compose their own story arc, which they refer to as &quot;sagas&quot;. In North America, 32 DVD compilations have been released by Funimation for the four sagas, with the first released on April 16, 2002, and the last on July 19, 2005. The episodes have been released in both edited and uncut formats. In addition, DVD collection boxes have been released for all four sagas, each containing all the episodes of that particular saga, except for the Dark Tournament Saga, which was split into two collection boxes. Funimation released season box sets of the anime starting with season one on July 8, 2008, and ending with season four on January 13, 2009. Each set contains four DVDs which have 28 episodes, or one-quarter of the whole series. Funimation began releasing the seasons on Blu-ray Disc on May 31, 2011. Cook has stated that the production staff made minor improvements to their recordings, such as redubbing certain lines, cleaning up the dialogue, and removing &quot;arrant anomalies&quot;. In Japan, three separate multi-disc DVD box sets were released, as well as 28 DVDs totaling all 112 episodes of the series. Japanese home video distributor Bandai Visual began releasing the series on Blu-ray Disc on October 27, 2009, with the first set containing a picture drama set after the end of the series that saw cast members reunite to record new dialogue.

===Films and original video animations===

Two animated films based on &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; have been produced. Both films have original storyline content that is not canonical to the manga. The first, titled &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; was released in Japan on July 10, 1993, as part of a seasonal film festival. In the movie, the protagonists Yusuke and Kuwabara are on a mission to rescue a kidnapped Koenma from a pair of demons who desire the Golden Seal, a stamp used for finalizing the sentencing of souls in the afterlife. AnimeWorks released an English dubbed version of the half-hour film on VHS in both English-dubbed and subtitled formats on May 5, 1998, and on DVD on January 30, 2001. , was released in Japanese theaters on April 9, 1994. The plot revolves around Yusuke and his friends defending the Human World against inhabitants of a fourth plane of existence called the &quot;Netherworld&quot;. This full-length feature received its first English dubbed version by Central Park Media, which released it on VHS on March 3, 1998, and on DVD on October 8, 2002, under the name &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho the Movie: Poltergeist Report&quot;.

A series of &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; OVAs collectively titled was released in Japan in VHS format between 1994 and 1996. The OVAs feature very short clips that take place after the end of the series. They also contain video montages from the anime, image songs, voice actor interviews, and satirical animated shorts focusing on the four protagonists. The OVAs consist of three volumes as well as an opening and ending encyclopedia. A four-DVD box set containing this series was released in Japan by Pony Canyon on December 15, 2004. Funimation dubbed the OVAs (though not the anime montages) and (re)dubbed the first theatrical film with their original cast from the anime, and released them both in North America in a two-disc DVD bundle titled &quot; Yu Yu Hakusho: The Movie &amp; Eizou Hakusho&quot; on December 13, 2011. This version splits up parts of the OVAs and does not include the Japanese voice actor interviews.

A brand new OVA of &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; was released with a Blu-ray box set of the series on October 26, 2018, in Japan. It adapts the &quot;Two Shot&quot; bonus chapter from the manga&#x27;s seventh volume and the manga&#x27;s penultimate chapter &quot;All or Nothing&quot;. In October 2019, Funimation announced the OVA release with an English dub.

===CDs===
The music for the &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; anime adaptation was composed by Yusuke Honma. The series has one opening theme, by Matsuko Mawatari, as well as five closing themes: , and &quot;Daydream Generation&quot; also by Mawatari; and and by Hiro Takahashi. When Funimation gained rights to the series, English language versions of each of these songs were produced and arranged by musician Carl Finch. The localized opening theme is sung by Sara White and the closing themes are sung by members of the English cast including Stephanie Nadolny, Jerry Jewell, and Meredith McCoy.

Several audio CDs have been released in Japan. The &quot;Yū Yū Hakusho Original Soundtrack&quot; was released in two volumes by Pony Canyon on January 18, 1997. The discs contain the show&#x27;s instrumental tracks and some vocal themes. Also released on that day is &quot;Yū Yū Hakusho: Music Battle&quot;, a series of three albums featuring vocal tracks sung by the Japanese voice actors as their corresponding characters. Compilations of vocal songs including &quot;Yū Yū Hakusho Super Covers&quot;, &quot;Yū Yū Hakusho Super Dance Mix&quot;, and &quot;Legend of Yu Yu Hakusho: &quot;Sai-Kyou&quot; Best Selection Album&quot; were released on December 16, 1995, March 21, 1996, and March 21, 1997, respectively. &quot;Yū Yū Hakusho: Collective Songs&quot; and &quot;Yū Yū Hakusho: Collective Rare Trax&quot;, which contain covers of the theme songs performed by the series&#x27; voice actors, were both released on March 17, 1999. Two drama albums have been released by Shueisha, the first of which has an audio adaptation of the chapter &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho Tales: Two Shot&quot;. A CD soundtrack for the second film and a maxi single with the vocal songs of Mawatari and Takahashi have also been published.

===Video games===

A number of video games have been developed that tie to the &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; series, most of which have been produced for and released exclusively in Japan. Prior to the launch of the franchise in North America, games were released on the Game Boy, Super Famicom, Sega consoles, and various platforms. North America only saw three video game releases. Two releases for the Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy Advanced handheld console, and one release for Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 2 console. A single Mega Drive game, &quot;Yū Yū Hakusho Makyō Tōitsusen&quot;, was published in Brazil by Tectoy in 1999 under the title &quot;YuYu Hakusho: Sunset Fighters&quot;. When Atari gained publishing rights to &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; video games in 2003, the company created and released three games in these regions: &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho: Spirit Detective&quot;, an action-adventure game for the Game Boy Advance; &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho: Tournament Tactics&quot;, a tactical role-playing game also for the Game Boy Advance; and &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho: Dark Tournament&quot;, a 3D fighting game for the PlayStation 2.

&quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; characters were also featured in the &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; crossover fighting games &quot;J-Stars Victory VS&quot; and &quot;Jump Force&quot;. Yusuke, Hiei, and Toguro are playable in both games.

In Japan, various collectibles such as trading figures, plush dolls, and gashapon toys also exist. A collectible card game based on the franchise was released by Movic. In North America, the series saw licensing for apparel from ODM, lines of action figures by IF Labs and Jakks Pacific, a Skannerz electronic toy from Radica Games, and an activities book from Scholastic. Score Entertainment created the &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho Trading Card Game&quot; for release in the United States. An English guidebook to the series titled &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho Uncovered: The Unofficial Guide&quot; was published by Cocoro Books on October 12, 2004.

A stage play adaptation produced by Office Endless was announced in May 2019. The play is written and directed by Chūji Mikasano, a screenwriter for the &quot;Tokyo Ghoul&quot; anime series. The play ran from August 8 to September 22, 2019, in Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka, and Aichi.

In September 2019, &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; joined the Universal Fighting System CCG, this marked the second anime license to make it into the system.

==Reception==
===Manga===
By 2013, &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; had over 50 million copies in circulation in Japan alone, making it one of &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot;&#x27;s best-selling manga series. Patricia Duffield, a columnist for &quot;Animerica Extra&quot;, acknowledged the manga as &quot;one of the kings of popularity in the mid-1990s&quot; in the region where it saw mass availability from large bookstore chains to small train station kiosks. &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; earned Yoshihiro Togashi the Shogakukan Manga Award for in 1993. Towards the end of the series&#x27; run, Togashi was publicly criticized for not meeting chapter deadlines and for lower quality art. On TV Asahi&#x27;s Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; ranked seventeenth.

In North America, several volumes of the manga have ranked within the weekly Nielsen BookScan graphic novels list, including volume five at both sixth and ninth in October 2004, volume six at sixth in February 2005, and volume seven at seventh in June 2005. In 2004, the &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; manga serialization sparked a controversy when a Florida grade school teacher issued a complaint about material found in an issue of the American &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; magazine purchased by a fifth-grade student at a Scholastic Book Fair. The complaint centered around portions of the manga containing violence, mild profanity, a character wearing a swastika, and another character smoking a cigarette. About 18,000 copies of the publication (out of 120,000) were returned from the fairs as a result of the matter. A Viz spokesperson defended the manga, clarifying that it is intended for older teens and that the alleged swastika is actually a Buddhist &quot;manji&quot;.

The &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; manga publication has received mixed criticism from reviewers in English-speaking regions. Martin Ouellette of the Canadian &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot; compared the progression of the series to &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; and stated, &quot;Togashi&#x27;s art, while simple, is extremely efficient and the story is really fun.&quot; An older article by the same reviewer disagreed with the notion that &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; was similar to &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, stating that the former franchise has better-developed characters, more interesting action sequences, and more humor. Eduardo M. Chavez of Mania.com enjoyed the manga&#x27;s artwork and found that the supporting characters tend to be illustrated with more detail than the main characters. He praised Lillian Olsen&#x27;s English translation but disliked Viz&#x27;s use of overlaying English words to translate the expression of sound effects. In later volumes, Chavez was dismayed by the transition of the manga from the early detective cases to the Dark Tournament arc. He asserted, &quot;Seeing fight, after fight, after fight gets boring and this seriously is only the start of this trend.&quot; Dan Polley, a staff reviewer of Manga Life, gave an average grade to the fifth volume, which entails Yusuke&#x27;s battle with Suzaku, the leader of the Four Beasts. Although he found some battle sequences engaging, Polley judged the chapters as lacking in characterization and development. Polley also discounted the manga&#x27;s comedy, considering the &quot;bit gags or fairly lame jokes&quot; to be &quot;too much&quot; at times.

===Anime===
The &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; television series was voted the best anime of the year in the 1994 and 1995 &quot;Animage&quot; Anime Grand Prix and the second best in 1993 after &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;. Additionally, the publication declared the series number 53 on its top 100 anime listing in 2001. In a 2006 web poll conducted in Japan by the network TV Asahi, &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; was voted as the fifteenth best anime of all time. The Japanese magazine &quot;Brutus&quot; voted it the sixth best anime of all time. The hit show garnered a large number of viewers during its run in Japan. Funimation president Gen Fukunaga remarked that &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; &quot;came &#x27;out of nowhere&#x27; to surprise people with huge ratings&quot;, which were just below those achieved by the popular series &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;. &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; was frequently watched by several age groups during its early run in North America. When it aired on Adult Swim, the anime, along with others such as &quot;Inuyasha&quot; and &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, met with male audiences ages 18–34. During its Toonami debut in May 2003, &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; placed in seven out of the top 111 Nielsen ratings for Cartoon Network telecasts, with the highest being number 30 on May 13 at a two percent share of all viewing televisions in the country. Atari stated in December 2003 that the anime was one of the top-rated television programs in North America for males ages 9–14. Nielsen additionally reported that &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; tied with &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; as the top-rated Cartoon Network program for the same demographic during the week of September 28, 2004. It was the second highest-rated show among ages 12–17 the same week. Cartoon Network dropped the show from Toonami in March 2005 due to declining ratings. &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; proved to be popular in the Philippines, where it was rerun several times and managed to draw more viewers in the prime time slot than both local and foreign soap operas.

The animated series received a generally positive reception in North America. In January 2004, &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; was named the second best action-adventure anime by &quot;Anime Insider&quot;. It was voted by the users of &quot;IGN&quot; as the tenth best-animated series of all time. Critical reviews focused on the series&#x27; attempt at a versatile balance of narrative, character development, and action sequences. &quot;Animerica&#x27;s&quot; Justin Kovalsky defined &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; as a character-driven series and compared it to other anime like &quot;Phantom Quest Corp.&quot;, &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, and &quot;Flame of Recca&quot; in that it successfully combines different ideas such as martial arts battles, character dynamics, the supernatural, and mythology. Allen Divers of the &quot;Anime News Network&quot; identified &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; as &quot;one of the best action series out there&quot;, and noted consistently good storytelling and character development throughout his critique of key points of the series. Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk declared, &quot;It&#x27;s a fun show with a great cast, a sense of humor, and a lot of action so there&#x27;s no excuse not to at least give it a chance.&quot; He recommended the first three-season box sets of &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot;, as well as the original box set of the Three Kings Saga, but enjoyed the show&#x27;s third season more than the others because of its multiple plotlines. N. S. Davidson of &quot;IGN&quot; concluded that having several concurrent plot branches is not enough for an anime to succeed, but that good writing, interesting characters, and action are also necessary. He proclaimed in his review of the anime&#x27;s final episodes that &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; possesses all of these qualities. This was concurred upon by Joseph Luster of &quot;Otaku USA&quot;, who summed up his feelings about the universe of &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; by stating, &quot;Togashi&#x27;s world is eternally hellish and dark, but wildly varied. The only thing that doesn&#x27;t change throughout its run is the fact that you&#x27;ll still be rooting for the well-defined protagonists until the credits run on the last episode.&quot;

Jeffrey Harris of &quot;IGN&quot; was more critical when looking at later episodes, and felt that the end of the show&#x27;s third arc involving the villain Sensui is too similar to the finale of the second arc with Toguro. He described the episodes as trying too hard to draw sympathy from the audience for the anime&#x27;s villains. Despite his overall praise of &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot;, Divers noted in a review about one DVD release that the show &quot;[walks] that fine line of a solid long-running series or being a broken record&quot;. He also called the artwork of the first few episodes &quot;dated&quot; and pointed out questionable script choices regarding the English dub.

Aedan Juvet of Funimation called the anime influential and &quot;timeless&quot; with classic villains, highlighting five villains in the series which helped the anime evolve.

<doc id="158586" wikidata="Q4581578" url="?curid=158586" title="Postmaster General of the United Kingdom">
<text>Postmaster General of the United Kingdom was a Cabinet ministerial position in HM Government. Aside from maintaining the postal system, the Telegraph Act 1868 established the Postmaster General&#x27;s right to exclusively maintain electric telegraphs. This would subsequently extend to telecommunications and broadcasting.

The office was abolished in 1969 by the Post Office Act 1969. A replacement public corporation, governed by a chairman, was established under the name of the Post Office (later subsumed by Royal Mail Group). The cabinet position of Postmaster General was replaced by a Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, with reduced powers, until 1974; most regulatory functions have now been delegated to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, although Royal Mail Group was overseen by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy before flotation.

==History==

In England, the monarch&#x27;s letters to his subjects are known to have been carried by relays of couriers as long ago as the 15th century. The earliest mention of &quot;Master of the Posts&quot; is in the &quot;King&#x27;s Book of Payments&quot; where a payment of £100 was authorised for Brian Tuke as master of the posts in February 1512. Belatedly, in 1517, he was officially appointed to the office of &quot;Governor of the King&#x27;s Posts&quot;, a precursor to the office of Postmaster General of the United Kingdom, by Henry VIII. In 1609 it was decreed that letters could only be carried and delivered by persons authorised by the Postmaster General.

In 1655 John Thurloe became Postmaster-General, a post he held until he was accused of treason and arrested in May 1660. 
His spies were able to intercept mail, and he exposed Edward Sexby&#x27;s 1657 plot to assassinate Cromwell and captured would-be assassin Miles Sindercombe and his group. Ironically, Thurloe&#x27;s own department was also infiltrated: his secretary Samuel Morland became a Royalist agent and in 1659 alleged that Thurloe, Richard Cromwell and Sir Richard Willis - a Sealed Knot member turned Cromwell agent - were plotting to kill the future King Charles II. About forty years after his death, a false ceiling was found in his rooms at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, the space was full of letters seized during his occupation of the office of Postmaster-General. These letters are now at the Bodleian Library.

In 1657 an act of the Commonwealth Parliament, entitled &#x27;Postage of England, Scotland and Ireland Settled&#x27;, set up a system for the British Isles and enacted the position of Postmaster General. The act also reasserted the postal monopoly for letter delivery and for post horses. After the Restoration in 1660, a further act, the Post Office Act 1660 (12 Cha. 2. c. 35), confirmed this and the post of Postmaster-General, the previous Cromwellian act being void.
1660 saw the establishment of the General Letter Office, which would later become the General Post Office (GPO). A similar position evolved in the Kingdom of Scotland prior to the 1707 Act of Union.
The (1 Will. 4. c. 8) established the unified office of Postmaster General of the United Kingdom

The office was abolished in 1969 by the Post Office Act 1969. A new public corporation, governed by a chairman, was established under the name of the Post Office (the part later subsumed by Royal Mail), which also had responsibility for telecommunications and the Girobank). The cabinet position of Postmaster General was initially replaced by a Minister of Posts and Telecommunications with less direct involvement; this department was dissolved in March 1974, with regulatory functions transferring to the Home Office, the Post Office retaining control of television licensing. Since 1992, most regulatory functions formerly conducted by the Postmaster General generally fall within the remit of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, although the present-day Royal Mail Group was overseen by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy until flotation.

==Masters of the King&#x27;s Post==
==Postmaster under the Commonwealth==
==Postmasters General of England, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom==
The earliest postmasters had responsibility for England and Wales. In 1707, on the Union with Scotland, the responsibility of the office was extended to cover the whole of the new Kingdom of Great Britain as well as Ireland, but with some powers held by a Post Office Manager for Scotland. By the Post Office (Revenues) Act 1710, with effect from 1711, the services were united, but with a Deputy Postmaster for Scotland. From 1784, there were also Postmasters General of Ireland, but under the Postmaster-General Act 1831, the postmasters based at Westminster became responsible for the whole of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, the Irish Free State became independent, and in 1923 it established its own arrangements under a Postmaster General of the Irish Free State. In 1924 the title became Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.

===Two Postmasters General, 1691–1823===
From 1691 to 1823 there were two Postmasters General, to divide the patronage between the Whigs and Tories.
===A single Postmaster General, 1823–1900===
In 1823 the idea of a Whig and a Tory sharing the post was abolished.
===Postmaster General, 1900–1969===
===Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, 1969-1974===

<doc id="158589" wikidata="Q610237" url="?curid=158589" title="Special district (United States)">
<text>Special districts (also known as special service districts, special district governments, or limited purpose entities) are independent, special-purpose governmental units that exist separately from local governments such as county, municipal, and township governments, with substantial administrative and fiscal independence. They are formed to perform a single function or a set of related functions. The term &quot;special district governments&quot; as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau excludes school districts. In 2017, the U.S. had more than 51,296 special district governments.

== Census definition ==
The United States Census counts government units across all States. This includes &quot;special districts&quot;. To count the special districts the Census must define the special districts so as to address all such governmental entities across the broad spectrum of 50 states&#x27; definitions and interpretations. The Census&#x27;s full definition is:

Special district governments are independent, special purpose governmental units, other than school district governments, that exist as separate entities with substantial administrative and fiscal independence from general purpose local governments. As defined for Census Bureau statistics on governments, the term &quot;special district governments&quot; excludes school district governments as they are defined as a separate governmental type.

Special district governments provide specific services that are not being supplied by existing general purpose governments. Most perform a single function, but in some instances, their enabling legislation allows them to provide several, usually related, types of services. The services provided by these districts range from such basic social needs as hospitals and fire protection, to the less conspicuous tasks of mosquito abatement and upkeep of cemeteries.

The Census Bureau classification of special district governments covers a wide variety of entities, most of which are officially called districts or authorities. Not all public agencies so termed, however, represent separate governments. Many entities that carry the designation &quot;district&quot; or &quot;authority&quot; are, by law, so closely related to county, municipal, town or township, or state governments that they are classified as subordinate agencies of those governments in Census Bureau statistics on governments, and are not counted as separate special district governments.

In order to be classified as a special district government, rather than as a subordinate agency, an entity must possess three attributes—existence as an organized entity, governmental character, and substantial autonomy. Each state description also lists various statutory authorities, commissions, corporations, and other forms of organizations that have certain governmental characteristics, but are subject by law to administrative or fiscal control by the state or by independent local governments; therefore, they are classified as subordinate agencies of those governments.
==Characteristics==

Special districts serve limited areas and have governing boards that accomplish legislatively assigned functions using public funds.

===Governing body===

Each district is governed by a board of directors, commissioners, board of supervisors, or the like. These boards may be appointed by public officials, appointed by private entities, popularly elected, or elected by benefited citizens (typically, property owners). Sometimes, one or more public officials will serve as an ex officio member on the board.

The board of a special district serves primarily as a managing board and often appoints a chief executive for day-to-day operations and decision making and policy implementation. In the New England states, special districts are often run in the same town meeting fashion as other local governments. Most districts have employees, but some districts exist solely to raise funds by issuing bonds and/or by providing tax increment financing.

===Functions===

Special districts perform many functions including airports, ports, highways, mass transit, parking facilities, fire protection, libraries, parks, cemeteries, hospitals, irrigation, conservation, sewerage, wastewater treatment, solid waste, fiber optic systems, stadiums, water supply, electric power, and natural gas utility.

==Legal basis==
Special districts are authorized by state law and must have public foundation, civil office, and public accountability.

===State law===

Special districts in the United States are founded by some level of government in accordance with state law (either constitutional amendment, general law, or special acts) and exist in all states. Special districts are legally separate entities with at least some corporate powers. Districts are created by legislative action, court action, or public referendum. The procedures for creating a special district may include procedures such as petitions, hearings, voter or landowner approval, or government approval. Tribal governments may create special districts pursuant to state law and may serve on the boards of special districts.

===Public foundation===

Special districts, like all public entities, have public foundation. The landmark case of the U.S. Supreme Court addressing public versus private charters was &quot;Dartmouth College v. Woodward&quot; in 1819. Dartmouth established the fundamental differences between public and private organizations. Critically, a government must be founded by all of the people of a governmental area or by their governmental representatives.

===Civil office===

Special districts possess some form of civil office, that is, the board has received a delegation of sovereign power from the state. Some boards may be appointed by only landowners. Private entities may appoint some or all of the members of a special district; however, there must be evidence of civil office. In addition to special districts with privately appointed boards, a special district may have a privately founded board; however, such a board could not be given the power to set a tax.

===Accountability===

There is a citizen-government fiscal accountability relationship. To maintain accountability for special districts, states must maintain ultimate control (the power to repeal the authorizing law at any time). Due to public foundation and, thus, ultimate control, the state can freely delegate sovereign power (such as the power to tax) to special districts and can allow them to act autonomously with little supervision.

==History==

There is little information available on the earliest special districts in the United States. It is known that park districts existed in the 18th century. Toll road and canal corporations existed in the 19th century. The first general statute authorizing irrigation districts was adopted by California in 1887. The U.S. Census Bureau began identifying and collecting data on special districts in 1942.

=== English custom ===
Special districts in the United States follow the English custom. The earliest known general law in England authorizing special purpose authorities was the Statute of Sewers of 1532. Single purpose authorities created by individual charters also existed at the time. However, the early authorities were temporary and unconnected to local government structure. The first laws authorizing permanent authorities connected to local governments were the Incorporated Guardians of the Poor, which were created by special acts in the 17th century. Turnpike trusts were an early and popular special purpose authority in England. Internal drainage boards are current examples in parts of England and Wales.

==Trends==

The state of Illinois leads the nation in the number of special districts with California close behind. State counts of their special districts may differ from the federal count because the states may have different definitions of a special district than the U.S. Census Bureau.

<text>Rupert Alexander Lloyd Grint (; born 24 August 1988) is an English actor. He rose to fame for his role as Ron Weasley in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series, for which he was cast at age eleven, having previously acted only in school plays and his local theatre group. Grint portrayed Weasley in all eight films in the series, beginning with &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001) and concluding with &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; (2011). Since then, he has continued to work in film, television, and theatre.

Beginning in 2002, Grint began to work outside of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; franchise, with a co-leading role in &quot;Thunderpants&quot;. He starred in the dramedy &quot;Driving Lessons&quot; (2006) and the drama &quot;Cherrybomb&quot; (2009) and co-starred in the comedy &quot;Wild Target&quot; (2010). After the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series concluded, he appeared in the films &quot;Into the White&quot; (2012), &quot;Charlie Countryman&quot; (2013), &quot;CBGB&quot; (2013), &quot;Moonwalkers&quot; (2015), and &quot;Knock at the Cabin&quot; (2023). Grint made his stage debut in 2013 in &quot;Mojo&quot; at the Harold Pinter Theatre. He executive-produced and starred in the television series &quot;Snatch&quot;, based on the film of the same name. He has also starred in the black comedy series &quot;Sick Note&quot;, the mystery thriller miniseries &quot;The ABC Murders&quot;, and the psychological horror series &quot;Servant&quot;.

==Early life==
Grint was born on 24 August 1988 in Harlow, Essex, to Nigel Grint, a dealer in racing memorabilia, and Joanne Grint (née Parsons). He is the eldest of five siblings. He has said that his earliest goal in life was to become an ice cream man. He grew up in Watton-at-Stone, Hertfordshire, and was educated at Richard Hale School, in Hertford. Grint was raised a Catholic and said he &quot;feared God&quot; as a child.

While in school, he took an avid interest in theatre. He began performing in school productions and joined the Top Hat Stage and Screen School, a local theatre group that cast him as a fish in &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; and a donkey in a nativity play. He continued participating in school plays as he moved into secondary school. Nonetheless, he had never acted professionally prior to the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. He left school at sixteen to focus on his acting career, saying he &quot;didn&#x27;t really like school that much&quot;.

==Career==
===1999–2011: &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and worldwide recognition===
Starting in 1999, casting began for the film adaptation of &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, the best-selling novel by J. K. Rowling. Rowling insisted the cast be British and assisted Susie Figgis and director Chris Columbus in casting the roles. Grint, a fan of the book series, chose to audition for the role of Ron Weasley, one of Harry Potter&#x27;s best friends at Hogwarts. Having seen a &quot;Newsround&quot; report about the open casting, he sent in a video of himself rapping about how he wished to receive the role, and the casting team asked for a meeting with him. In August 2000, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Grint were selected to play Harry, Hermione Granger, and Ron. Grint is the oldest member of the trio. The release of &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; in 2001 was Grint&#x27;s debut screen performance. Breaking records for opening-day sales and opening-weekend takings, it was the year&#x27;s highest-grossing film. With a total of US$974 million in its theatrical run, it stands as the series&#x27; second most commercially successful entry. It was critically well-received, scoring mainly positive reviews. However, a number of critics found the adaption&#x27;s faithfulness to the book both its best and worst quality. Grint won a Satellite Award in the category of Outstanding New Talent, and a Young Artist Award for Most Promising Young Newcomer.

A year later, Grint again starred as Ron in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (2002). It opened to positive reviews and critics generally enjoyed the lead actors&#x27; performances. Both &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;New York Magazine&quot; observed that Grint and his peers had matured between films, with the latter pointing out that Grint had become &quot;more proficient&quot; and said they missed &quot;the amateurish ardour&quot; the actor and Watson carried in &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (2004) was released on 31 May in the UK. The film sees all three of its lead characters hover on the brink of adolescence, &quot;and while they look braver and more capable than before, the dangers they face seem far more grave and their vulnerability more intense.&quot; Alfonso Cuarón took over direction for &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban,&quot; which remains the lowest-grossing &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film with US$795 million in revenue. Nonetheless, it was the second highest-grossing movie of 2004, behind &quot;Shrek 2&quot;.
In 2005, Grint reprised his role for the fourth film in the series &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;. The adaptation, unlike previous films, explored romantic elements and included more humour. In a 2005 interview with IGN, all three lead actors singled out humour as a reason for the film&#x27;s success. It was directed by Mike Newell, whom Grint characterised as &quot;really loud and not afraid to swear at you, but he was really cool&quot;. &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; is one of the series&#x27; best-reviewed instalments, and is noted for its characters&#x27; maturity and sophistication, darker and more complex plotline, and the quality of the screenplay and lead actors&#x27; performances.

&quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, the fifth film in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; franchise, was released to cinemas in 2007. A huge financial success, it set a record worldwide opening-weekend gross of US$394 million, superseding &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;. It was directed by a new filmmaker, David Yates, who directed all of the subsequent &quot;Potter&quot; films. Grint said the laid-back director was &quot;really good&quot; and helped keep the material fresh. Grint and his &quot;Harry Potter&quot; co-stars left imprints of their hands, feet and wands in front of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theater in Hollywood.

On 15 July 2009, the series&#x27; sixth instalment, &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, was released and again set box office records. In its theatrical run, it earned US$933 million ticket sales. It is also one of the most positively reviewed Harry Potter films, with critics praising its &quot;emotionally satisfying&quot; story, direction, cinematography, visual design and music. Grint observed a change in Ron in this entry, pointing out that his once insecure, often overshadowed character started to become more secure and even began to show a dark side. He found it fun to personify a more emotional Ron. Between 2009 and 2010, Grint&#x27;s work received three award nominations, including one win—an Otto Award from the German magazine &quot;Bravo&quot;.
Despite the previous films&#x27; successes, the franchise&#x27;s future was put into question when the three lead actors had reservations about signing on for the final two films. However, by March 2007, Grint agreed to return for the last installments. For financial and scripting reasons, the final book was divided into two films, shot back-to-back, with filming concluding in June 2010. After completing the final film, Grint said: &quot;I mean it literally has been my childhood, and suddenly it all came down to really just one random scene, with us jumping through a fireplace, and then it was over. ...it&#x27;s very odd. Because suddenly it was all over, just like that. It was really emotional for all of us, realising that we&#x27;re never going to be doing this again.&quot;

&quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; (2010) was released in November and grossed over US$950 million. It set several box office records and received mostly favourable reviews. Grint&#x27;s portrayal of Ron again earned him critical praise. Reviewing the adaption for &quot;Slate&quot;, Dana Stevens called all three of the leads &quot;terrific&quot;. Although he disliked the film, Joe Morgenstern of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that &quot;Grint has grown up to be a skilful actor who knows the value of a slow burn&quot;. Grint&#x27;s performance brought him nominations from the MTV Movie Awards and National Movie Awards for Best Fight and Performance of the Year in 2011. He reprised his role for the seventh time in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;, the final &quot;Harry Potter&quot; instalment. It resumed from where the previous film left off, and included a lot of action, whereas &quot;Part 1&quot; had focused more on character development. Grint, along with the film, was critically acclaimed: Ann Hornaday of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Who could have predicted that Radcliffe, Grint and Watson would turn out to be good actors?&quot;. The film broke several box office records, including biggest midnight release, biggest first-day opening, and biggest opening-weekend. &quot;Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; became the fourth highest-grossing film of all time.
&quot;Harry Potter&quot; author J. K. Rowling gave a speech at the world premiere of &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; on 7 July 2011 in London. She said that there were seven &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series cast members whom she called &quot;The Big Seven&quot;; Grint was one of them, with Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Tom Felton, Matthew Lewis, Evanna Lynch and Bonnie Wright.

===2002–2011: Concurrent film work during &quot;Harry Potter&quot;===
In 2002, Grint starred in his first non-&quot;Harry Potter&quot; film, &quot;Thunderpants&quot;, which revolves around Patrick (played by Bruce Cook) whose remarkable capacity for flatulence scores him a job as an astronaut. In this film, Grint played the co-lead role of Alan, an anosmic boy who is Patrick&#x27;s only friend. It was generally ignored by critics and audiences. Most critics who did take notice of it did not respond well to it, with one writing: &quot;This film should be shown in prisons so that inmates have a good reason to never return.&quot; Grint also appeared in &quot;Driving Lessons&quot;, a comedy drama released in 2006, starring opposite Julie Walters. It met with a mixed reception by critics, but his portrayal of an oppressed teenage boy was generally praised. &quot;Alt Film Guide&quot;&#x27;s Andre Soares wrote: &quot;Grint, on the other hand, is a revelation . . . [He] displays an innate naturalness mixed with personal charisma that turn a potentially pathetic Christian freak into a humorous, thoroughly likable – if more than a little awkward – young man&quot;.

In July 2008, it was announced that Grint would star in the drama film &quot;Cherrybomb&quot; with Robert Sheehan and Kimberley Nixon. Grint found shooting this film very different from the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, as he had to adjust to doing a dozen scenes per day. Grint&#x27;s character—Malachy, a worker at Belfast—goes to great lengths to impress his boss&#x27;s daughter, with whom he is infatuated. This film, like his next project, involved him playing violent roles. Despite premiering at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival, the film was initially unable to find a distributor. An online campaign by Grint&#x27;s fans was credited with helping to secure a distribution deal in the UK in 2010.

Jonathan Lynn directed Grint in &quot;Wild Target&quot;, a 2010 comedy thriller, where he starred with Emily Blunt and Bill Nighy. A remake of the 1993 French film &quot;Cible Emouvante&quot;, it was made on a relatively small budget of US$8 million. It was a commercial failure, earning only US$3.4 million, and garnered mostly negative reviews in the media, which criticised it for dishonouring the original film and wasting the comedic potential of its cast. However, Grint also attracted some positive notice: &quot;It&#x27;s nice to see Rupert Grint perform well in a role other than that of Ron Weasley, and it&#x27;s clear that he&#x27;s got a career ahead of him.&quot;

In January 2011, Grint made a cameo appearance on the BBC popular comedy show &quot;Come Fly with Me,&quot; starring comedy duo Matt Lucas and David Walliams (Little Britain). In March 2011, he was cast as the lead character in the small-budget anti-war Norwegian film &quot;Into the White&quot;, directed by Petter Næss. Principal photography started in April, and the film, which was shot on location, was released in 2012. It is based on a real incident that took place on 27 April 1940, when German Luftwaffe pilot Horst Schopis&#x27;s bomber was shot down at Grotli by a Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm Blackburn Skua, which then crash-landed. The several German and British crew members found shelter by chance during a harsh winter there.

In August 2011, Grint did a photo shoot with his friend and &quot;Harry Potter&quot; co-star Tom Felton in Los Angeles for the autumn/winter collection of the fashion label Band of Outsiders. In September 2011, it was announced that Grint would voice a character in the film adaptation of Postman Pat along with David Tennant, Stephen Mangan and Jim Broadbent; it was released in May 2014. Grint also appears in the music video for Ed Sheeran&#x27;s song &quot;Lego House&quot;, released on 20 October 2011.

===2012–present: Further work, theatre, and television===
In March 2012, the &quot;Visit Britain&quot; TV ad was released, featuring Grint alongside Julie Walters, Michelle Dockery and Stephen Fry, promoting holidaying at home in the UK. Later that month, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Grint had been cast alongside Chloë Grace Moretz in &quot;The Drummer&quot;, a biopic film about drummer Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys. That day, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; confirmed it and announced that filming would begin 15 June 2012 in California and Savannah, Georgia.
On 25 July 2012, Grint carried the 2012 London Olympic torch during the Olympic Torch Relay, part of the London 2012 Summer Olympics. He told the BBC News that it was an &quot;overwhelming&quot; experience that he &quot;hoped to remember forever&quot;, and told &quot;The Daily Telegraph,&quot; &quot;It was amazing, it was really overwhelming. It&#x27;s just such an honour to be a part of this. I&#x27;m really proud&quot;. In October 2012, he narrated &quot;We Are Aliens&quot;, a 25-minute 3D Planetarium Fulldome film about the possibility of other intelligent life in the universe.

On 13 February 2013, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;&#x27;s Live Feed announced that Grint would star in a television pilot for CBS called &quot;Super Clyde&quot;. It did not become a series. In July 2013, it was confirmed that Grint would make his stage debut in the second run of Jez Butterworth&#x27;s black comedy &quot;Mojo&quot;, with Grint playing Sweets, a hood who &quot;pops amphetamines like Smarties&quot; and &quot;does a sort of double act, full of comic menace&quot;. The play, which also starred Brendan Coyle, Ben Whishaw and Daniel Mays, was based on real-life events, and ran from 26 October 2013 to 8 February 2014 at the Harold Pinter Theatre in London. Grint won the WhatsOnStage Award for Best London Newcomer for his role.
In September 2013, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; confirmed that Grint would star in an adaptation of Macbeth called &quot;Enemy of Man&quot;, also featuring Sean Bean, Charles Dance, Jason Flemyng, James D&#x27;Arcy, Neil Maskell and Joe Gilgun, and directed by Vincent Regan. Filming began in January 2014 in the United Kingdom. In June 2014, it was announced that Grint would make his Broadway debut as Frank Finger in the play &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Play&quot; at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, appearing with Matthew Broderick, Nathan Lane, Stockard Channing, and Megan Mullally. It ran from 28 August 2014 to 4 January 2015.

Since 2019, Grint has starred as Julian Pearce in the Apple TV+ psychological horror series &quot;Servant&quot;. The series has been critically praised. In December 2021, the show was renewed for its fourth and final season.

Grint starred in the 2022 Netflix anthology series &quot;Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s Cabinet of Curiosities&quot; and in M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s 2023 thriller film &quot;Knock at the Cabin&quot;. He also reunited with multiple cast members of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series for an HBO Max special, &quot;Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts&quot;, which premiered on 1 January 2022.

==Personal life==
Grint has been in a relationship with actress Georgia Groome since 2011. They have a daughter, born in May 2020. He joined Instagram in November 2020, posting a photo of himself holding his newborn daughter. He reached one million followers within four hours and one minute of creating his account, breaking the previous Guinness World Records title for the fastest time to reach one million followers on the platform.

As Grint&#x27;s earliest ambition was to be an ice cream man, he bought an ice cream van with the money he earned from the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series and sold ice cream to local customers.

He took part in the 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay, carrying the flame through Hendon in northwest London to outside Middlesex University.

Grint is a keen football fan and an avid supporter of Tottenham Hotspur.

===Philanthropy===
Grint has supported various charitable organisations, including donating personal items to charity auctions. He participated in the Wacky Rally in 2010 with James and Oliver Phelps, which raised money for Britain&#x27;s Royal National Lifeboat Institution. He was one of more than 40 people to produce designs for the Chrysalis Collection for Keech Hospice Care in Luton. His piece, a painted butterfly, was auctioned on eBay in March 2010. In May 2011, with other celebrities, he took part in the &quot;Make Mine Milk&quot; ad campaign to promote daily milk drinking. His ads were seen on posters and the sides of thousands of buses across the United Kingdom. Since 2011, he has supported the Little Star Award for Cancer Research UK. &quot;I think that it&#x27;s wonderful that Cancer Research UK is helping to bring a little bit of magic to the children&#x27;s lives in this way,&quot; he said.

===Tax affairs===
In 2016, Grint lost an appeal against HMRC&#x27;s decision to block his attempt to change his accounting date. This move was intended to reduce his tax liability by deferring income into a lower tax year. At that time, the actor was calculated to have earned around £24 million from the Harry Potter franchise. However, HMRC successfully argued that the change was motivated by tax avoidance rather than legitimate business reasons.

In 2019, HMRC brought another case against Grint. He was ordered to pay an additional £1.8 million in tax after losing the legal battle with HMRC. The tax authority argued that a £4.5 million sum he received should be classified as income rather than as a capital asset which is subject to much lower tax rate. This ruling increased his tax liability for the 2011–12 tax year. Grint later lost his appeal claim and was ordered to pay £1.8 million of tax liability and legal costs.

<text>Rotokas is a North Bougainville language spoken by about 4,320 people on Bougainville Island in Papua New Guinea. 

Central Rotokas is most notable for its extremely small phonemic consonantal inventory, lacking phonemic nasals, and for having perhaps the smallest modern alphabet.

== Dialects ==
According to Allen and Hurd (1963), there are three identified dialects: Central Rotokas (&quot;Rotokas Proper&quot;), Aita Rotokas, and Pipipaia; with a further dialect spoken in Atsilima (Atsinima) village with an unclear status.

==Phonology==
The Central dialect of Rotokas possesses one of the world&#x27;s smallest phonemic consonantal inventories. Central Rotokas has a vowel length distinction between long and short, but otherwise lacks distinctive suprasegmental features such as tone, and probably stress.

===Consonants===
Whereas Central Rotokas has only six consonantal phonemes, Aita Rotokas has nine; Aita adds phonemic nasals (e.g. this example of a minimal pair, vs. ). The Central dialect&#x27;s limited inventory likely arose by collapsing the phonemic distinction between nasals and non-nasals.

Nasals in Aita always correspond to voiced plosives in Central (e.g. &quot;tree&quot; is in Aita and in Central), but voiced plosives in Central can correspond to either nasals or voiced plosives in Aita.

==== Central Rotokas ====
Consonants occur in three places of articulation: bilabial, alveolar, and velar, each with a voiced and an unvoiced variant. The three voiced phonemes each have wide allophonic variation, with the allophonic sets , , and . This makes the choice of symbols for phonemes somewhat arbitrary. 

Nasals are rarely heard. They will sometimes be misused when speakers try to pronounce English words (e.g. &quot;bye-bye&quot; being pronounced ), or when trying to imitate a foreigner speaking Rotokas (even if they were not used by the foreigner).

* In the 1960s, was described as being before . Later research in the 2000s found this to no longer be true, possibly due to widespread bilingualism with Tok Pisin.

==== Aita Rotokas ====
The Aita dialect has nine consonant phonemes, with a three-way distinction required between voiced, voiceless, and nasal consonants.
* varies between and .
* is chiefly realized as .
* is before .

===Vowels===
Vowels in the Central dialect may be long or short, but the Aita dialect seems to have no length distinction.

=== Orthography ===
The Rotokas orthography uses 12 letters of the Latin alphabet, with no diacritics or ligatures. The letters are &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;i, k&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;p, r, s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v.&quot; Long vowels are written as doubled. /t/ is written as before /i/, but &lt;t&gt; elsewhere.

Rotokas has also been written with an orthography based on the IPA symbols for its phonemes.

===Stress===
Stress is probably not phonemic. Words with 2 or 3 syllables are stressed on the initial syllable; those with 4 are stressed on the first and third; and those with 5 or more on the antepenultimate. This is complicated by long vowels, and there are exceptions to the third rule among some verb constructions.

== Grammar ==

Typologically, Rotokas is a fairly typical verb-final language, with adjectives and demonstrative pronouns preceding the nouns they modify, and postpositions following. Although adverbs are fairly free in their ordering, they tend to precede the verb, as in the following example:

<text>Shrove Tuesday (also known as Pancake Tuesday or Pancake Day) is the final day of Shrovetide, marking the end of pre-Lent. Lent begins the following day with Ash Wednesday. Shrove Tuesday is observed in many Christian countries through participating in confession, the ritual burning of the previous year&#x27;s Holy Week palms, finalizing one&#x27;s Lenten sacrifice, as well as eating pancakes and other sweets.

Shrove Tuesday is observed by many Christians, including Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists, Western-rite Orthodox Christians, and Roman Catholics, who &quot;make a special point of self-examination, of considering what wrongs they need to repent, and what amendments of life or areas of spiritual growth they especially need to ask God&#x27;s help in dealing with.&quot; This moveable feast is determined by the date of Easter. The expression &quot;Shrove Tuesday&quot; comes from the word &quot;&quot;, meaning absolution following confession. Christians traditionally visit their church on Shrove Tuesday to confess their sins and clean their soul, thus being &quot;shriven&quot; (absolved) before the start of Lent.

As this is the last day of the Christian liturgical season historically known as Carnival or Shrovetide, before the penitential season of Lent, related popular practices, such as indulging in food that one might give up as their Lenten sacrifice for the upcoming forty days, are associated with Shrove Tuesday celebrations. The term &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; is French for &quot;Fat Tuesday&quot;, referring to the practice of the last night of eating richer, fatty foods before the ritual fasting of the Lenten season, which begins on Ash Wednesday. Many Christian congregations thus observe the day through eating pancakes or, more specifically, the holding of pancake breakfasts, as well as the ringing of church bells to remind people to repent of their sins before the start of Lent. On Shrove Tuesday, churches also burn the palms distributed during the previous year&#x27;s Palm Sunday liturgies to make the ashes used during the services held on the very next day, Ash Wednesday.

In some Christian countries, especially those where the day is called Mardi Gras or a translation thereof, it is a carnival day, the last day of &quot;fat eating&quot; or &quot;gorging&quot; before the fasting period of Lent. Additionally, since 1958, the Roman Catholic Church celebrates the Feast of the Holy Face of Jesus on Shrove Tuesday.

==History==
The tradition of marking the start of Lent has been documented for centuries. Ælfric of Eynsham&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical Institutes&quot; from around 1000 AD states: &quot;In the week immediately before Lent everyone shall go to his confessor and confess his deeds and the confessor shall so shrive him as he then may hear by his deeds what he is to do [in the way of penance]&quot;. By the time of the late Middle Ages, the celebration of Shrovetide lasted until the start of Lent. 

During the liturgical season of Lent, believers have historically abstained from rich foods such as meat, eggs, lacticinia (dairy products), and alcohol—a practice that continues in Eastern Christianity (in denominations such as the Coptic Orthodox Church) and among Western Christian congregations practicing the Daniel Fast. Shrovetide provided Christians with the opportunity to use up these foods prior to the start of the 40-day fasting season of Lent. Prior to the 6th century, Lent was normatively observed through the practice of the Black Fast, which enjoins fasting from food and liquids, with the allowance of one vegetarian meal after sunset. The tradition of pancake breakfasts during Shrovetide, as well as that of pancake races, owes itself to this practice of &quot;using up the surplus eggs, milk and butter&quot; prior to Lent. As such, it was traditional in many societies to eat pancakes or other foods made with the butter, eggs and fat or lard that would need to be used up before the beginning of Lent. Similar foods are fasnachts and pączki. The specific custom of British Christians eating pancakes on Shrove Tuesday dates to the 16th century. 

Along with its emphasis on feasting, another theme of Shrove Tuesday involves Christians repenting of their sins in preparation to begin the season of Lent in the Christian liturgical calendar. In many Christian parish churches, both Protestant and Roman Catholic, a popular Shrove Tuesday tradition is the ringing of the church bells (on this day, the toll is known as the Shriving Bell) &quot;to call the faithful to confession before the solemn season of Lent&quot; and for people to &quot;begin frying their pancakes&quot;.

==Terminology==
The word &quot;shrove&quot; is a form of the English word &quot;shrive&quot;, which means to give absolution for someone&#x27;s sins by way of Confession and doing penance. Thus Shrove Tuesday was named after the custom of Christians to be &quot;shriven&quot; before the start of Lent.

In the United Kingdom, Ireland and parts of the Commonwealth, Shrove Tuesday is also known as Pancake Day or Pancake Tuesday, as it became a traditional custom to eat pancakes as a meal. In Irish the day is known as , from the Latin , &quot;beginning of Lent.&quot; Elsewhere, the day has also been called &quot;Mardi Gras&quot;, meaning &quot;Fat Tuesday&quot;, after the type of celebratory meal that day.

In Germany, the day is known as Fastnachtsdienstag, Faschingsdienstag, Karnevalsdienstag or Veilchendienstag (the last of which translates to violet [the flower] Tuesday). It is celebrated with fancy dress and a partial school holiday. Similarly, in German American areas, such as Pennsylvania Dutch Country, it is known as Fastnacht Day.

In the Netherlands, it is known as &quot;vastenavond&quot;, or in Limburgish dialect &quot;, though the word &quot; usually refers to the entire period of carnival in the Netherlands. In some parts of Switzerland (e.g. Lucerne), the day is called Güdeldienstag or Güdisdienstag (preceded by Güdismontag). According to the Duden dictionary, the term derives from &quot;Güdel&quot;, which means a fat belly stuffed full of food.

In Portuguese-, Spanish- and Italian-speaking countries, among others, it is known as Carnival (to use the English spelling). This derives from Medieval Latin (&quot;the putting away of flesh&quot;) and thus to another aspect of the Lenten fast, to abstain from eating meat. It is often celebrated with street processions or fancy dress.

The most famous of these events has become the Brazilian Carnival in Rio de Janeiro. Venetians have long celebrated carnival with a masquerade. The use of the term &quot;carnival&quot; in other contexts derives from this celebration. In Spain, the Carnival Tuesday is named &quot;día de la tortilla&quot; (&quot;omelette day&quot;): an omelette made with some sausage or pork fat is eaten. On the Portuguese island of Madeira, &quot;malasadas&quot; are eaten on &quot;Terça-feira Gorda&quot; (Fat Tuesday in English), which is also the last day of the Carnival of Madeira. Malasadas were cooked in order to use up all the lard and sugar in the house, in preparation for Lenten restrictions. This tradition was taken to Hawaii, where Shrove Tuesday is known as Malasada Day, which dates back to the days of the sugar plantations of the 1800s. The resident Catholic Portuguese workers (who came mostly from Madeira and the Azores) used up butter and sugar prior to Lent by making large batches of &quot;malasadas&quot;.

In the Lutheran countries of Denmark and Norway, the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday is called &quot;Fetetirsdag&quot; (&quot;Fat Tuesday&quot;); the prior weekend is known as &quot;Fastelavn&quot; and is marked by eating &quot;fastelavnsboller&quot;. Fastelavn is the name for Carnival in Denmark, held either on the Sunday or Monday before Ash Wednesday. This holiday occurs seven weeks before Easter Sunday, with children dressing up in costumes and gathering treats for the Fastelavn feast. The holiday is generally considered to be a time for children&#x27;s fun and family games and on Shrove Sunday, &quot;the churches hold a special family service where children are invited to wear fancy dress.&quot; In Estonia, the day is similarly called Vastlapäev and is generally celebrated by eating pea soup and whipped-cream or whipped-cream and jam-filled sweet-buns called &quot;vastlakukkel&quot;, similar to the Swedish or . Children also typically go sledding on this day.

In Iceland, the day is known as &quot;Sprengidagur&quot; (Bursting Day) and is marked by eating salted meat and peas. In Lithuania, the day is called . People eat pancakes (&quot;blynai&quot;) and Lithuanian-style doughnuts. In Sweden, the day is called &quot;Fettisdagen&quot; (Fat Tuesday), and is generally celebrated by eating a type of almond paste-filled sweet roll called or . In Finland, the day is called and is generally celebrated by eating green pea soup and a pastry called (sweet bread filled with whipped cream and jam or almond paste, same as the Swedish ). Estonian traditions also associate with the semla and the day is known as Vastlapäev. It is a celebration of Balto-Finnic origins, which includes both pagan and ecclesiastic traditions, and is often described as a &quot;mid-winter sliding festival&quot; and the day often includes downhill sledging.

In Poland, a related celebration falls on the Thursday before Ash Wednesday and is called (Fat Thursday). In some areas of the United States with large Polish-American communities, such as Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, and Buffalo, Tłusty Czwartek is celebrated with or eating contests, music and other Polish food. It may be held on Shrove Tuesday or in the days immediately preceding it.

In Slovenia, Kurentovanje is also the biggest and best known carnival. There are several more local carnivals usually referred to as Laufarija. In Hungary, and the Hungarian-speaking territories, it is called () and is celebrated by fancy dress and visiting neighbours.

==Traditions==
Shrove Tuesday serves a dual purpose of allowing Christians to repent of any sins they might have committed before the start of Lent on the next day Ash Wednesday and giving them the opportunity to engage in a last round of merriment before the start of the somber Lenten season, which is characterized by making a Lenten sacrifice, fasting, praying and engaging in various spiritual disciplines, such as marking a Lenten calendar, fasting, abstaining from luxuries, and reading a daily devotional.

The Lenten fast traditionally emphasizes eating simpler, vegetarian food, and refraining from food that would give undue pleasure; as such, Christians historically abstained from meat, eggs and lacticinia (dairy products) during the 40-day fasting season of Lent—a practice that continues in Eastern Christianity (in denominations such as the Coptic Orthodox Church) and among Western Christian congregations practicing the Daniel Fast. Pancakes are associated with Shrove Tuesday, the day preceding Lent, because they are a way to use up rich foods such as eggs, milk, and sugar, before the fasting season of the 40 days of Lent.

In Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island, small tokens are frequently cooked in the pancakes. Children take delight in discovering the objects, which are intended to be divinatory. For example, the person who receives a coin will be wealthy; a nail indicates that they will become or marry a carpenter.

===Observances===

On the final day of Shrovetide, Shrove Tuesday, many traditional Christians, such as Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists and Roman Catholics, &quot;make a special point of self-examination, of considering what wrongs they need to repent, and what amendments of life or areas of spiritual growth they especially need to ask God&#x27;s help in dealing with.&quot; As such, many churches offer Confession on Shrove Tuesday.

On Shrove Tuesday, many Christians finalize their decision with respect to what Lenten sacrifices they will make for Lent. While making a Lenten sacrifice, it is customary to pray for strength to keep it; many often wish others for doing so as well, e.g. &quot;May God bless your Lenten sacrifice.&quot;

During Shrovetide, many churches place a basket in the narthex to collect the previous year&#x27;s Holy Week palm branches that were blessed and distributed during the Palm Sunday liturgies; on Shrove Tuesday, churches burn these palms to make the ashes used during the services held on the very next day, Ash Wednesday.

===Festivities===

In the United Kingdom, as part of community celebration, many towns held traditional Shrove Tuesday &quot;mob football&quot; games, some dating as far back as the 17th century. The practice mostly died out in the 19th century after the passing of the Highway Act 1835 which banned playing football on public highways. A number of towns have maintained the tradition, including Alnwick in Northumberland (Scoring the Hales), Ashbourne in Derbyshire (called the Royal Shrovetide Football), Atherstone in Warwickshire (called simply the Atherstone Ball Game), St Columb Major in Cornwall (called Hurling the Silver Ball), and Sedgefield in County Durham (Sedgefield Ball Game).

Shrove Tuesday was once known as a &quot;half-holiday&quot; in Britain. It started at 11:00 am with the ringing of a church bell. On Pancake Day, &quot;pancake races&quot; are held in villages and towns across the United Kingdom. The tradition is said to have originated in 1445 when a housewife from Olney, Buckinghamshire, was so busy making pancakes that she forgot the time until she heard the church bells ringing for the service. She raced out of the house to church while still carrying her frying pan and pancake, tossing it to prevent it from burning. The pancake race remains a relatively common festive tradition in the UK, especially England. Participants with frying pans race through the streets tossing pancakes into the air and catching them in the pan while running. The pancake race at Olney traditionally has women contestants who carry a frying pan and race over a course to the finishing line. The rules are strict: contestants must toss the pancake at the start and the finish, and wear a scarf and apron.

Since 1950, the people of Liberal, Kansas, and Olney have held the &quot;International Pancake Day&quot; race between the two towns. The two towns&#x27; competitors race along an agreed-upon measured course. The times of the two towns&#x27; competitors are compared to determine a winner overall. As of 2021, Liberal leads the competition with 38 wins to Olney&#x27;s 31. A similar race is held in North Somercotes in Lincolnshire, England.

In London, the Rehab Parliamentary Pancake Race takes place every Shrove Tuesday, with teams from the British lower house (the House of Commons), the upper house (the House of Lords), and the Fourth Estate, contending for the title of Parliamentary Pancake Race Champions. The fun relay race is to raise awareness of Rehab, which provides a range of health and social care, training, education, and employment services in the UK for disabled people and others who are marginalised.
Scarborough celebrates by closing the foreshore to all traffic, closing schools early, and inviting all to skip. Traditionally, long ropes were used from the nearby harbour. The town crier rang the pancake bell, situated on the corner of Westborough (main street) and Huntriss Row. Since 1996 a replica &quot;pancake bell&quot; situated at Newborough and North Street has been rung to initiate the day&#x27;s festivities.

Shrove Tuesday in England often involved a form of ritual begging, not dissimilar to wassailing, in which children and adolescents would go door-to-door asking for tidbits from the frying pan. If the household was not forthcoming, they could expect levels of mischief, including the pelting of their house, knock and run, or gate stealing. This was known as Lent Crocking, Nicky-Nan Night, the Drawing of Cloam, Dappy-Door Night, or Pan Sharding. The children of the hamlet of Whitechapel, Lancashire, keep alive a local variant of this tradition by visiting local households and asking &quot;please a pancake&quot;, to be rewarded with oranges or sweets. It is thought this local tradition arose when farm workers visited the wealthier farm and manor owners to ask for pancakes or pancake fillings.

In Ireland, the observance of fasting at Lent continued up to the 20th century, with Shrove Tuesday (, &quot;Tuesday of the &quot;) marking the last day of the consumption of meat for the Lenten period. This was later relaxed, but with three days of fasting observed, Ash Wednesday, Spy Wednesday, and Good Friday. It was a tradition that the eldest unmarried daughter would toss the first pancake. If the pancake fell on the floor, she would remain unmarried for the next 12 months. As marriages were not traditionally permitted during the Lenten period, as decreed by the Council of Trent, weddings on Shrove Tuesday were popular. In some parts of Ireland the holly from Christmas was saved and burnt in the fire for the pancakes. The night was also known as &quot;Skellig Night&quot; in Counties Cork and Kerry, during the celebrations, those who were unmarried were taunted with jeers and singing.

Thin pancakes called blini are traditional in Christian festivals in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia also at this time of year (Maslenitsa).

<doc id="158608" wikidata="Q57418" url="?curid=158608" title="Denis Sassou Nguesso">
<text>Denis Sassou Nguesso (born 23 November 1943) is a Congolese politician and former military officer who has served as president of the Republic of the Congo since 1997. He also previously served as president from 1979 to 1992.

Sassou Nguesso headed the Congolese Party of Labour (PCT) for 12 years during his first period as president. His daughter Edith Lucie Bongo married Gabonese President Omar Bongo in 1989. He introduced multiparty politics in 1990, but was stripped of executive powers by the 1991 National Conference, remaining in office as a ceremonial head of state. He stood as a candidate in the 1992 presidential election but placed third. 

Sassou Nguesso was an opposition leader for five years before returning to power during the Second Republic of the Congo Civil War, in which his rebel forces ousted President Pascal Lissouba. Following a transitional period, he won the 2002 presidential election, which involved low opposition participation. He was re-elected in the 2009 presidential election. That same year his daughter and her husband Omar Bongo died.

Sassou Nguesso passed a new constitution via referendum in 2015 amidst calls for boycott then a dismissal of results by opposition leaders. The new constitution enabled him to stand for another term. Sassou Nguesso was re-elected in the 2016 and 2021 presidential elections with a majority in the first round.
==Early life==
A member of the Mbochi tribe, Sassou Nguesso was born in Edou in the Oyo district in northern Congo in 1943. His parents are Julien Nguesso and Émilienne Mouebara. Nguesso was the youngest child in the family. His father was a notable hunter chief in Edou. He received primary education in Fort Rousset, now Owando. He studied in Dolisie Normal College between 1956 and 1960. 

== Military career ==
He joined the army in 1960 just before the country was granted independence. He received military training in Algeria. In 1962, he returned to Congo and was reassigned to active duty with the rank of second lieutenant. A year later, he joined the Application School for Infantry, at Saint-Maixent-l&#x27;École, France whence he graduated with the rank of lieutenant. He returned to join Congo&#x27;s elite paratroop regiment. He was one of the first officers of the Airborne Group, the first paratroop battalion of the Congolese Army, which was created by Marien Ngouabi in 1965. He commanded the Airborne Group, the army and the Brazzaville Military Zone (ZAB), and then headed the Intelligence department of the State Security Services. He became captain, then commander, and was promoted to colonel (1978) and later as army general (1989).

==Political career==
===1963–1979: early positions===
He was part of the 1968 military coup that overthrew president Massemba Debat and brought Marien Ngouabi to power. He was a founding member of the National Revolution Council (&quot;Conseil National de la revolution&quot;) in December 1968.

In 1968, Sassou Nguesso took part in the military coup led by Commander Marien Ngouabi against Debat: He was a member of the Congolese National Revolution Council (&quot;Conseil National de la révolution&quot;) established on 5 August 1968. Under the leadership of Marien Ngouabi, the group limited the president&#x27;s powers, before the latter finally resigned on 3 September 1968. Ngouabi officially became head of state in January 1969.

In December 1969, Sassou Nguesso was elected as a member of the first central committee of the new Congolese Labor Party (&quot;Parti Congolais du travail&quot;, PCT). It was a communist party with a Marxist–Leninist doctrine. It was headed by Marien Ngouabi as president of the central committee, president of the republic and head of state.

A new constitution was issued on 31 December 1969, which designated the country as the People&#x27;s Republic of Congo.

In March 1970, following a failed coup attempted by Pierre Kinganga, a former lieutenant who was exiled in the neighboring Congo-Kinshasa, an extraordinary session of the PCT&#x27;s congress was held, during which Sassou Nguesso integrated the political bureau of the PCT.

On 18 May 1973, Sassou Nguesso, who had been corps commander of the airborne group, was made Director of State Security.

In 1975, amid an economic crisis, an extraordinary session of the PCT central committee was summoned. The eight members of the political bureau resigned and were replaced by a restricted &quot;Revolutionary Special General Staff&quot; (&quot;Etat major spécial révolutionnaire&quot;), composed of five members, including Sassou Nguesso, and headed by Marien Ngouabi. At the end of the extraordinary session, Marien Ngouabi asked Sassou Nguessou and five other members for a report on the economic and political situation. The paper became known as the &quot;Declaration of 12 December 1975&quot;. It recommended the &quot;radicalization&quot; of the revolution.

In the same period, he was appointed Minister of Defense and Security at age 32.

On 18 March 1977, president Marien Ngouabi was assassinated. Official media stated that the assassination was conducted by a commando group led by Capt. Barthelemey Kikadidi. Others claimed that the assassination was plotted by military officers within the close circle of power.

A Military Committee of the Congolese Labor Party (&quot;Comité militaire du PCT&quot;) composed of eleven officers and led by Major Sassou Nguesso immediately took power and repealed the 1973 constitution. Sassou Nguesso acted as interim head of state from 18 March to 6 April 1977, then he conceded his position to general Joachim Yhombi-Opango, who became president. Sassou Nguesso held the position of 1st vice president of the committee, while retaining his position of minister of defense.

Shortly after the Ngouabi assassination, Massamba-Debat and his former prime minister Pascal Lissouba were arrested and accused by a courts-martial of plotting the assassination. Massamba-Debat was executed on 25 March 1977. Sassou Nguesso was appointed provisional president on 8 February, before being confirmed, during a special congress on 31 March 1979 as head of the central committee, President of the Republic, head of state and President of the council of ministers, for five years.

On 8 July 1979, general elections were held and confirmed the PCT as the dominant political force: the Congolese Labor Party won all the seats in the People&#x27;s National Assembly. A new constitution was adopted by referendum, confirming the socialist foundations of the country.

===1979–1991: three presidential terms===
As the newly elected president, Sassou Nguesso negotiated loans from the International Monetary Fund and allowed foreign investors from France and the Americas to conduct oil and mineral extraction. 

Although he was considered by French diplomats as representative of the radical wing of the PCT and as the Soviet Union and Cuba&#x27;s man, Sassou Nguessou developed and maintained strong relationships with France on which he relied to support the staggering economy. The French oil company Elf Aquitaine played an important role in the exploitation of Congolese oil fields that led to the doubling of oil production and in supporting Congolese government expenses via pre-financing loans.

He visited France in October 1979 and in July 1981 to seek economic support. In October 1980, high-ranking French political figures including former president Valery Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, and former prime ministers Jacques Chirac and Pierre Messmer, were guests to the celebration of the Brazzaville centenary.

In May 1980 Sassou Nguessou signed a twenty-year friendship pact with the Soviet Union and in the same year sent two delegations to China while a Chinese minister visited Brazzaville. However, the economic impact of these relationships remained marginal: France provided up to 50% of the country&#x27;s foreign aid while the Soviet Union&#x27;s contribution did not exceed 1.5%.

Sassou Nguesso was re-elected for a five-year term as President of the PCT Central Committee and President of the Republic at the party&#x27;s Third Ordinary Congress on 27–31 July 1984, He announced the release of Yhombi-Opango. He served as Chairman of the Organization of African Unity from 1986 to 1987. In late 1987 he faced down a serious military revolt in the north of the country with French aid.

At the PCT&#x27;s Fourth Ordinary Congress on 26–31 July 1989, Sassou Nguesso was re-elected as President of the PCT Central Committee and President of the Republic, and the PCT won all of the seats of the People&#x27;s National Assembly. With the collapse of the socialist states of Eastern Europe, as well as influence from the French, Sassou Nguesso began to bring the country towards capitalism.

In December 1989 he announced the end of government control of the economy and declared a partial amnesty for political prisoners. Over the following year, he attempted to improve the failing economic situation and reduce the outrageous levels of corruption. Starting in September 1990 political parties other than the PCT were allowed and Sassou Nguesso made a symbolic state visit to the United States, laying the grounds for a new series of conditional International Monetary Fund loans later that year.

He introduced multiparty politics in 1990 and was then stripped of executive powers by the 1991 National Conference, remaining in office as a ceremonial head of state. He stood as a candidate in the 1992 presidential election but placed third.

In February 1991, a national conference began; the opposition gained control of the conference. The conference&#x27;s declaration of its own sovereignty was not challenged by Sassou Nguesso. He was subjected to serious criticism and allegations during the Conference, including a claim from some delegates that he was involved in Ngouabi&#x27;s assassination.

===1992–1997: First Civil War and election campaigns===
The first round of elections took place on 24 June, and the second on 19 July. Senate elections took place on 26 July. In the parliamentary election of June–July 1992, the PCT won only 19 of 125 seats in the National Assembly; the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy (UPADS) led by former prime minister Pascal Lissouba, was the largest party. But it could not obtain an absolute majority in the National Assembly, with the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development (MCDDI) led by former army General Bernard Kolelas in second position.

In the August 1992 presidential election, Sassou Nguesso was eliminated in the first round, placing third with 17% of the vote. He fared poorly everywhere except the north. The second round was held between Lissouba (UPADS) and Kolelas (MCDDI); Sassou Nguesso backed Lissouba, who won in the second round with 61.32% of the vote.

Lissouba became President of the Republic on 31 August and a new Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Stephane Bongho-Nouarra of UPADS, was formed on 7 August. In the meantime, a new alliance of seven parties, including the MCDDI and the Rally for Democracy and Social Progress (RDPS) was constituted. It was soon joined by the PCT, which was unhappy with the distribution of ministerial portfolios, thus ensuring a new parliamentary majority.

On 31 October, the National Assembly approved a motion of no confidence against Bongho-Nouarra who resigned. On 17 November, President Lissouba dissolved Parliament, announcing elections to break the deadlock. In December, Claude Antoine Dacosta was appointed prime minister at the head of a transitional government.

Civil war started in November 1993, when the opposition parties (UDR and PCT) contested the results of the parliamentary elections (October 1993) giving victory to the coalition supporting President Lissouba (Tendance présidentielle). Armed militia supporting President Lissouba (Cocoyes, Zoulous and Mambas) clashed with Kolelas&#x27; Ninjas and Sassous Nguesso&#x27;s Cobras. The conflict ended in December 1995, but left at least 2,000 dead and more than 100,000 displaced.

After this episode Sassou Nguesso spent seven months in Paris in 1996, returning on 26 January 1997 to contest the presidential election scheduled for July.

===1997–2008: Second Civil War and return to the presidency===
The second round of the civil war erupted a few weeks before the presidential election.

In May 1997, a visit by Sassou Nguesso to Owando, Yhombi-Opango&#x27;s political stronghold, led to the outbreak of violence between his supporters and those of Yhombi-Opango. On 5 June 1997, government forces surrounded Sassou Nguesso&#x27;s home in the Mpila section of Brazzaville, attempting to arrest Pierre Aboya and Engobo Bonaventure, who had been implicated in the violence. Fighting broke out between government forces and Cobras, which led to the second civil war.

At the beginning of the conflict, Kolelas&#x27; militia remained neutral, but on 8 September 1997, he joined the president&#x27;s camp and became prime minister. On 18 September, Angolan troops and airforce entered the battle, providing significant support to Sassou Nguesso. By 14 October a final assault covered by Angolan MiG aircraft was launched on the Presidential Palace and neighborhoods in south Brazzaville, then on Pointe Noire, against the President&#x27;s militias (Zoulou, Cocoys, Aubervillois and Mambas) and the Ninjas.

By October, Sassou Nguesso was in control, while Lissouba as well as Kolelas and Opango left the country. On 25 October 1997, Sassou Nguesso was sworn in.

He repealed the 1992 Constitution, and replaced it with a &quot;Fundamental Act&quot; that concentrated power in the President&#x27;s hands. General Sassou Nguesso accumulated the functions of President of the Republic, Head of State, Head of Government, Minister of Defense and Supreme Chief of the Armies.

A government was announced on 2 November 1997; it consisted mainly of members and relatives of the FDU (Forces Démocratiques unifies, a coalition between the PCT and other parties supporting Sassou Nguesso) as well as two members respectively of UPADS and MCDDI, who were not chosen by the presidents in exile.

He also called for a National reconciliation forum. However, the idea was rejected by Lissouba&#x27;s followers who continued to strike into the region between the country&#x27;s economic capital, Pointe Noire and Brazzaville, having cut the railway between the coast and Brazzaville for three months. In December 1997 heavy fighting resumed in the capital&#x27;s southern suburbs (the Pool area) where the Ninja militia clashed with Congolese and Angolan troops and Cobra militiamen. As many as 1,500 may have been killed in the fighting, and thousands more fled to escape the violence.

The Forum for Unity and National Reconciliation was held from 5 to 8 January 1998 with 1,420 delegates. It decided upon a transitional period of three years, to be followed by elections under a new Constitution. It also formed a 75-member National Transitional Council (NTC) to act as a legislative body. Members were elected by the forum by mid-January. However, violence did not end. By April 1998, militias opposed to Sassou Nguesso operated throughout southern Congo, coordinating their operations. In the beginning of 1999, violence had resumed in Brazzaville. Peace agreements were signed on 25 December under the auspices of President Omar Bongo of Gabon, ending the civil war, leaving 8,000–10,000 dead, around 800,000 displaced persons and a devastated country.

 Presidential elections were held on 10 March 2002. 12 candidates entered the race, but only seven remained throughout the electoral process., Two candidates were disqualified by the Supreme Court on 10 February 2002 while two (Martin Mberi and General Anselme Makoumbou) withdrew from the race, on 6 March, protesting a lack of transparency in the electoral process. On 10 March, two days before the election, Andre Milongo, seen as the main challenger, withdrew, also citing a lack of transparency and calling for a boycott.

The elections passed peacefully and Sassou Nguesso won with 89.41% of the votes. Serious malfunctions and acts of manipulation in a few electoral commissions were reported by the European Union Election Observation Mission, who reported that these acts did not impact the final result, and called for the sanction of those responsible in order to prevent the situation from happening again in the next elections.

Sassou Nguesso was elected Chairman of the African Union, the OAU&#x27;s successor body, in January 2006. His election was the result of a compromise reached to prevent the chairmanship from going to Omar al-Bashir.

===2009–2016: Re-election and constitutional referendum===

Sassou Nguesso was re-elected as President of the Central Committee of the PCT at the party&#x27;s Fifth Extraordinary Congress in December 2006. He was re-elected in the July 2009 presidential election with 78.61% of the vote amidst an opposition boycott. He said that his re-election meant continued &quot;peace, stability and security&quot;, and he called for an end to &quot;thinking like ... freeloaders&quot; in reference to international aid. At his inauguration Sassou Nguesso announced that he would support an amnesty bill to pardon Lissouba, who had gone into exile after his 1997 ouster and was convicted of crimes &quot;in absentia&quot;. Sassou Nguesso said that he wanted the amnesty bill to be presented to Parliament by the end of 2009. As Congo-Brazzaville prepared to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its independence from France in 2010, Sassou Nguesso noted that the country had far to go in fully realizing the dream of independence: &quot;Our country will not be totally independent until our people are free of the yoke of poverty.&quot;

On 27 March 2015 Sassou Nguesso announced that his government would hold a referendum to change the 2002 constitution, which would allow him to run for a third consecutive term. The proposal was overwhelmingly approved by voters, with 92.96% in favor. Turnout was officially placed at 72.44%. However the opposition argued that due to low turnout, the results should be annulled.

On 20 March 2016, Sassou Nguesso ran for a third consecutive term of 5 years and was reelected in the first round with 60% of the vote.

Opposition leader Guy-Brice Parfait Kolelas finished second with 15 percent of the vote while retired general Jean-Marie Mokoko, a former security adviser to Sassou Nguesso, came third with 14 percent.

For the first time in the history of the Republic, these elections were supervised by an independent commission (CNEI: Commission Nationale Electorale Indépendante). The opposition rejected the outcome, alleging fraud and calling for civil disobedience.

===2021: Re-election===

During the presidential election that took place on 21 March 2021, Sassou Nguessou, who faced six challengers for the presidency, came first once again, garnering 88.4% of the votes. His main challenger, Guy Brice Parfait Kolélas, finished second with 7.96%, Mathias Dzon received 1.92%, and the other four candidates each received less than 1% each.

In December 2022, he attended the United States–Africa Leaders Summit 2022 in Washington, D.C. and met with US President Joe Biden. 

In July 2023, he attended the 2023 Russia–Africa Summit in Saint Petersburg and met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. During the summit, Nguesso called for peace in Ukraine.

==African Union and the Libyan crisis==
As the Chairman of the African Union High Level Committee on Libya, Sassou Nguesso stated, &quot;The settlement of the Libyan crisis appears, more than ever, as an absolute urgency&quot;, especially because of the possible negative impact of terrorist groups in the south of Libya on neighboring states.

He declared &quot;this crisis remains, before any other consideration, an African problem.&quot;

==Controversies==
In September 2005, Sassou Nguesso and his entourage of more than fifty people stayed eight days at the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan, New York, for Sassou Nguesso to deliver a fifteen-minute speech to the United Nations General Assembly. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that the trip cost a total of US$295,000, with thousands of dollars spent on room service alone. Sassou Nguesso was criticized by the Republic of Congo&#x27;s creditors, as he was in negotiations with the World Bank and the UN International Monetary Fund to cancel Congolese debts, claiming inability to repay them. 

In July 2007, British NGO Global Witness published documents showing that the President&#x27;s son, Denis-Christel Sassou Nguesso, may have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars from the country&#x27;s oil sales on shopping sprees in Paris and Dubai. The documents show that in August 2006, Denis Christel, who was the head of Cotradethe marketing branch of Congo&#x27;s state oil firm SNPCspent $35,000 on purchases from designers such as Louis Vuitton and Roberto Cavalli. Reputation management company Schillings Solicitors unsuccessfully attempted to suppress this information.

On 30 November 2020, Sassou Nguesso and four ministers issued a decree terminating a contract with Australian mining company Sundance Resources to develop the Mbalam-Nabeba iron-ore deposit. Permits for the areas Avima, Nabeba and Bandodo were instead awarded to Sangha Mining Development, a subsidiary of Best Way Finance, a Hong Kong Corporation.

<doc id="158618" wikidata="Q3479611" url="?curid=158618" title="Regimental sergeant major">
<text>Regimental sergeant major (RSM) is an appointment that may be held by a warrant officer (WO) in the British Army, the Royal Marines, and the armies of many other Commonwealth and former Commonwealth nations. It is also an actual rank in the Irish Defence Forces, and formerly in the British Army, Royal Marines and United States Army. Only one warrant officer holds the appointment of RSM in any regiment or battalion, making them the senior warrant officer; in a unit with more than one top-ranked WO, the RSM is considered to be first amongst equals&quot;. The RSM is primarily responsible for assisting their commander in maintaining standards and discipline amongst the non-commissioned members and acts as a parental figure to their subordinates, sometimes referred to by the mantra &quot;Drill, Dress and Discipline&quot;.

==Australia==
A regimental sergeant major in the Australian Army is usually a warrant officer class 1 and holds a special position within a regiment or battalion as the senior non-commissioned adviser to the unit&#x27;s commanding officer. They are known as the regimental sergeant major regardless of whether the unit is a regiment or battalion. The RSM has leadership, discipline and welfare responsibilities of up to 650 soldiers, as well as the maintenance of their equipment.

The most senior warrant officer in the Australian Army is titled Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army.

==Canada==
In the Canadian Forces, the appointment of regimental sergeant major is normally held by an army chief warrant officer. Due to the integrated nature of the Canadian Forces, however, it is not impossible for an air force chief warrant officer or a naval chief petty officer 1st class to rise to that post, especially in units with a high number of support trades personnel; examples might include a Royal Canadian Logistics Service CPO1 being appointed RSM of a service battalion, or an air force Communications and Electronics Branch CWO appointed to the position in a communication regiment.

RSMs are generally address as &quot;RSM&quot; or &quot;Mr&quot; or &quot;Ms&quot; by officers, and as &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot; by subordinates (which applies only to regimental sergeant majors who are army or air force CWOs; naval CPO1s are universally addressed as &quot;Chief&quot;, regardless of any appointments held).

== Nigeria ==
In the Nigerian Army, the appointment of RSM is usually held by a master warrant officer. The RSM, during any visit from a general officer, marches slowly in front of the military procession with a brightly coloured and decorated wooden stick.

==Singapore==
Like most Commonwealth forces, the RSM in the Singapore Armed Forces is usually the most senior warrant officer in the unit. Depending on the size of the unit, RSMs can be third, second, first, master, or senior warrant officers.

Exceptions to this are:
* In the presence of another warrant officer; however even under these circumstances, the RSM is treated as the senior warrant officer of the unit while the other warrant officers are recognised as officers.
* In National service (reserve equivalent) battalions which often have national service junior sergeants fast-tracked for promotion holding the RSM appointment.

During exercises and operations, the role of the RSM is to organize the battalion for movement, and to assist the unit S1 (manpower officer) in manpower administration.

In camp, he is the master of drill, parades and ceremonies. He supervises the company sergeants major and platoon sergeants in the instruction of drill, and is in charge of the organization of formal parades. On the parade square, the RSM, with his pace stick, is &quot;king&quot; as he has authority over all soldiers and even has the power to order punishment for subalterns (junior commissioned officers such as captains and lieutenants). In fact, the RSM may conduct &quot;subalterns&#x27; parades&quot; – private sessions for junior officers to perfect their foot and sword drills away from the critical eyes of the other ranks.

Senior officers may address them simply as &quot;RSM&quot;, while, as a warrant officer, they are addressed as &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot; by those junior in rank. Traditionally, all warrant officers, with or without an appointment as RSM or CSM, are addressed as &quot;Encik&quot; (&quot;mister&quot; in English) by officers and other ranks although this is an informal right which is not to be assumed. Sometimes, lower ranked NCOs who are not warrant officers but who are holding the appointment of CSM may also be given the honour of being addressed as &quot;Encik.&quot; Nevertheless, all specialists and warrant officers holding sergeant-major appointments should be addressed as &quot;sergeant-major&quot;.

==United Kingdom==
In the British Army and Royal Marines, the RSM, who always holds the rank of warrant officer class 1 (WO1), is addressed as &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot; by his or her subordinates. In the Household Cavalry, the appointment is regimental corporal major (RCM). The rank of regimental sergeant major existed in the British Army until 1915, when RSMs (who already held warrant officer status) were regraded as warrant officers class I and RSM became an appointment of that rank.

In the Royal Marines, regimental sergeant major was an actual rank (and equivalent to warrant officer class I in the Army) until the Royal Marines themselves re-adopted the ranks of warrant officer classes I and II (which had been abolished in the Royal Marines in 1920) in 1973 (although the term continued to be used interchangeably for warrant officers class I until at least 1981). The most senior warrant officer in the Royal Marines holds the appointment of Corps Regimental Sergeant Major.

==United States==
The equivalent rank in the United States Army is command sergeant major. The rank of regimental sergeant major existed in the United States Army during World War I. The rank was phased out in the early 1920s.

The billet, as opposed to rank, of regimental sergeant major exists in the United States Marine Corps, as the senior enlisted adviser to the regimental commander. The billet is held by a sergeant major.

Unlike many countries, sergeant majors in the United States are not classified as warrant officers, as warrant officers in the United States hold a different status.

<text>Eugen Semitjov (22 May 1923 - 12 June 1987) was a Swedish journalist, writer and artist of Russian descent, born in Sweden.

==Background==

Semitjov started drawing in 1942 during his military service in Sweden. He was an expert on spacecraft, especially Soviet ones, and worked as a translator from Russian during Yuri Gagarin&#x27;s visit to Sweden. 
He also often worked as an illustrator for Aftonbladet, especially when the subject was related to space technology. He covered the Apollo space programme as a journalist in Florida. As a Russian speaker, he obtained rare interviews with people involved in the Soviet space programme. Semitjov was awarded the Stora Journalistpriset in Sweden in 1972 for his work as a journalist.

His non-fiction books were about the actress Greta Garbo, science, speculative science such as possible future space colonies and spaceships, with illustrations by well-known space artists such as Fred Gambino and David A. Hardy. He also wrote a small number of novels for young people. At a time when the belief that aliens had visited Earth was widespread, he published a book on the subject, deliberately giving it a title and cover to attract the &#x27;true believers&#x27;, while the majority of the book&#x27;s content was devoted to debunking a number of well-known UFO cases. 

As well as writing books, he was the author of the science fiction comic &quot;Allan Kämpe&quot;, first published in December 1942. At first glance the stories appear to be a straight copy of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, but the comic has more in common with Sidney Jordan&#x27;s &#x27;Jeff Hawke&#x27;.

He was a leading member of the Swedish Space Movement Association when it was founded in 1984 to promote interest in space travel in Sweden. In 1991, the association changed its name to the Swedish Space Society and then gradually went dormant during the first half of the 1990s, only to be revived in 2012. After Semitjov&#x27;s death in 1987, the Swedish space movement established a prize in his memory, the Eugen Semitjov Prize.

<text>The Jesus Seminar was a group of about 50 biblical criticism scholars and 100 laymen founded in 1985 by Robert Funk that originated under the auspices of the Westar Institute. The seminar was very active through the 1980s and 1990s, and into the early 21st century.

Members of the Seminar used votes with colored beads to decide their collective view of the historicity of the deeds and sayings of Jesus of Nazareth. They produced new translations of the New Testament and apocrypha to use as textual sources. They published their results in three reports: &quot;The Five Gospels&quot; (1993), &quot;The Acts of Jesus&quot; (1998), and &quot;The Gospel of Jesus&quot; (1999). They also ran a series of lectures and workshops in various U.S. cities.

The work of The Jesus Seminar continued after the death of its founder (2005) and was succeeded by two seminars: The Seminar on God and the Human Future and The Christianity Seminar. The latter published its first report in 2022, &quot;After Jesus Before Christianity: A Historical Exploration of the First Two Centuries of Jesus Movement&quot;s. The seminars are the scholarly program units of Westar Institute. Westar publishes a bi-monthly magazine for the general public, &quot;The Fourth R: An Advocate for Religious Literacy.&quot;

The Jesus Seminar has come under intense criticism regarding its method, assumptions and conclusions from a wide array of scholars and laymen.

== Search for the &quot;Historical Jesus&quot; ==

The Seminar&#x27;s reconstruction of the historical Jesus portrayed him as an itinerant Hellenistic Jewish sage and faith-healer who preached a gospel of liberation from injustice in startling parables and aphorisms. An iconoclast, Jesus broke with established Jewish theological dogmas and social conventions both in his teachings and in his behavior, often by turning common-sense ideas upside down, confounding the expectations of his audience: he preached of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s imperial rule&quot; (traditionally translated as &quot;Kingdom of God&quot;) as being already present but unseen; he depicted God as a loving father; he fraternized with outsiders and criticized insiders. According to the Seminar, Jesus was a mortal man born of two human parents, who did not perform nature miracles nor die as a substitute for sinners nor rise bodily from the dead. Sightings of a risen Jesus represented the visionary experiences of some of his disciples rather than physical encounters. While these claims, not accepted by conservative Christian laity, have been repeatedly made in various forms since the 18th century, the Jesus Seminar addressed them in a unique manner with its consensual research methodology.

The Seminar treated the canonical gospels as historical sources that represent Jesus&#x27; actual words and deeds as well as elaborations of the early Christian community and of the gospel authors. The Fellows placed the burden of proof on those who advocate any passage&#x27;s historicity. Unconcerned with canonical boundaries, they asserted that the Gospel of Thomas may have more authentic material than the Gospel of John.

The Seminar held a number of premises or &quot;scholarly wisdom&quot; about Jesus when critically approaching the gospels. Members acted on the premise that Jesus did not hold an apocalyptic worldview, an opinion that is controversial in mainstream scholarly studies of Jesus. The Fellows argued that the authentic words of Jesus, rather than revealing an apocalyptic eschatology which instructs his disciples to prepare for the end of the world, indicate that he preached a sapiential eschatology, which encourages all of God&#x27;s children to repair the world.

The methods and conclusions of the Jesus Seminar have come under harsh criticism from numerous biblical scholars, historians and clergy for a variety of reasons. Such critics assert, for example, that the Fellows of the Seminar were not all trained scholars, that their voting technique did not allow for nuance, that they were preoccupied with the Q source and with the Gospel of Thomas but omitted material in other sources such as the Gospel of the Hebrews, and that they relied excessively on the criterion of embarrassment.

==Use of historical methods==
The scholars attending sought to reconstruct the life of the historical Jesus. Using a number of tools, they asked who he was, what he did, what he said, and what his sayings meant. Their reconstructions depended on social anthropology, history and textual analysis. The key feature was the rejection of apocalyptic eschatology. They used cross-cultural anthropological studies to set the general background, narrow in on the history and society of first-century Palestine, and used textual analysis (along with more anthropology and history) to focus on Jesus himself. They used a combination of primary sources, secondary sources, and archaeological evidence. Their methodology, as developed by a team of scholars (who expounded papers for the review of other Fellows and published many in &quot;Forum&quot;) and as explained in the book &quot;The Five Gospels&quot; (the four canonical gospels plus the Gospel of Thomas), involved canvassing the records of the first four centuries for traditions about Jesus and sifting them by criteria such as multiple attestation, distinctiveness, and orality.

===&quot;Seven pillars of scholarly wisdom&quot;===
&quot;The Five Gospels&quot; lists seven bases for the modern critical scholarship of Jesus, claiming these &quot;pillars&quot; have developed since the end of the 18th century:
# Distinguishing between the historical Jesus and the stories that the gospels tell about him. Hermann Samuel Reimarus (1694–1768) started the quest for the historical Jesus and David Friedrich Strauss established it as part of biblical criticism with his book &quot;Life of Jesus Critically Examined&quot; (1835).
# Distinguishing between the Synoptics and John. Since the 1800s, Bible scholars have distinguished between the Jesus of the Synoptic gospels (Mark, Matthew, and Luke) and the Jesus in John, generally favoring the synoptics as more historical and seeing John as more spiritual.
# Identifying Mark as the first gospel. By 1900, critical scholars had largely concluded that Mark came before Matthew and Luke and served as a source for each.
# Identifying the hypothetical Q document. By 1900, scholars had hypothesized this lost collection of Jesus&#x27; sayings, thought to be the source of material found in Matthew and Luke but not in Mark.
# Questioning eschatological (apocalyptic) Jesus. In 1906, Albert Schweitzer portrayed Jesus as a failed apocalyptic prophet, and this analysis virtually put an end to historical inquiry into Jesus. In the 1970s and 1980s, however, critical historians returned to the topic of historical Jesus. Some of these scholars identified the apocalyptic imagery in the gospels as originating with John the Baptist, and not authentic to Jesus.
# Distinguishing between oral and print cultures. Since Jesus lived and preached in an oral culture, scholars expect that short, memorable stories or phrases are more likely to be historical.
# Reversing the burden of proof. In his day, Strauss had to offer evidence to question the historicity of any part of the gospels because his audience assumed that the gospels were historical. Today, the assumption is nearly the opposite, with the gospels understood to be so thoroughly embellished that one needs evidence to suppose that anything in them is historical.

====Noneschatological Jesus====
&quot;The Five Gospels&quot; says that the non-apocalyptic view of the historical Jesus gained ground in the 1970s and 1980s when research into Jesus shifted out of religious environments and into secular academia. Marcus Borg says &quot;the old consensus that Jesus was an eschatological prophet who proclaimed the imminent end of the world has disappeared&quot;, and identifies two reasons for this change:
# Since the 1960s, some scholars have started to view the gospel references to the coming Son of Man as insertions by the early Christian community.
# Some scholars have begun to see Jesus&#x27; kingdom of God as a present reality, a &quot;realized eschatology&quot;, rather than an imminent end of the world (cf. Luke 17:20–21).

The apocalyptic elements attributed to Jesus, according to &quot;The Five Gospels&quot;, come from John the Baptist and the early Christian community (p. 4).

Scholars involved in the third and next quests for the historical Jesus have constructed a variety of portraits and profiles for Jesus. However, there is little scholarly agreement on the portraits, or the methods used in constructing them. But according to Theissen and Merz, writing in 1996, while the noneschatological Jesus is a significant trend in contemporary research into the historical Jesus, most scholars affirm the traditional view that Jesus prophesied the imminent end of the world. Since the 1990s, however, other scholars have pointed out the complexity of apocalypticism within Second Temple Judaism, and grant that Jesus did make &quot;apocalyptic&quot; predictions, but in relation to the destruction of the Jewish Temple in 70 AD, and not the end of the world.

==The scholars&#x27; translation==
The Seminar began by translating the gospels into modern American English, producing what they call the &quot;Scholars Version&quot;, first published in &quot;The Complete Gospels&quot;. This translation uses current colloquialisms and contemporary phrasing in an effort to provide a contemporary sense of the gospel authors&#x27; styles, if not their literal words. The goal was to let the reader hear the message as a first-century listener might have. The translators avoided other translations&#x27; archaic, literal translation of the text, or a superficial update of it. For example, they translate &quot;woe to you&quot; as &quot;damn you&quot;. The authors of &quot;The Complete Gospels&quot; argue that some other gospel translations have attempted to unify the language of the gospels, while they themselves have tried to preserve each author&#x27;s distinct voice.

==Methodology==
The first findings of the Jesus Seminar were published in 1993 as &quot;The Five Gospels: The Search for the Authentic Words of Jesus&quot;.

The Fellows used a voting system to evaluate the authenticity of about 500 statements and events. For certain high-profile passages the votes were embodied in beads, the color of which represented the degree of confidence that a saying or act was or was not authentic:
* Red beads – indicated the voter believed Jesus did say the passage quoted, or something very much like the passage. (3 Points)
* Pink beads – indicated the voter believed Jesus probably said something like the passage. (2 Points)
* Grey beads – indicated the voter believed Jesus did not say the passage, but it contains Jesus&#x27; ideas. (1 Point)
* Black beads – indicated the voter believed Jesus did not say the passage—it comes from later admirers or a different tradition. (0 Points)

A confidence value was determined from the voting using a weighted average of the points given for each bead; the text was color-coded from red to black (with the same significance as the bead colors) according to the outcome of the voting.

===Criteria for authenticity===
The Jesus Seminar treats the gospels as fallible historical artifacts, containing both authentic and inauthentic material. The Seminar fellows used several criteria for determining whether a particular saying or story is authentic, including the criteria of multiple attestation and embarrassment. Among additional criteria used by the fellows are the following:

*Orality: According to current estimates, the gospels were not written until decades after Jesus&#x27; death. Parables, aphorisms, and stories were passed down orally (30–50 CE). The fellows judged whether a saying was a short, catchy pericope that could possibly survive intact from the speaker&#x27;s death until decades later when it was first written down. If so, it is more likely to be authentic. For example, &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;.
*Irony: Based on several important narrative parables (such as the Parable of the Good Samaritan), the fellows decided that irony, reversal, and frustration of expectations were characteristic of Jesus&#x27; style. If a pericope presents opposites or impossibilities, it is more likely to be authentic. For example, &quot;love your enemies&quot;.
*Trust in God: A long discourse attested in three gospels has Jesus telling his listeners not to fret but to trust in the Father. Fellows looked for this theme in other sayings they deemed authentic. For example, &quot;Ask – it&#x27;ll be given to you&quot;.

===Criteria for inauthenticity===
The Seminar looked for several characteristics that, in their judgment, identified a saying as inauthentic, including self-reference, leadership issues, and apocalyptic themes.

*Self-reference: Does the text have Jesus referring to himself? For example, &quot;I am the way, and I am the truth, and I am life&quot; (John 14:1–14)
* Framing material: Are the verses used to introduce, explain, or frame other material, which might itself be authentic? For example, in Luke, the &quot;red&quot; parable of the good samaritan is framed by scenes about Jesus telling the parable, and the seminar deemed Jesus&#x27; framing words in these scenes to be &quot;black&quot;.
* Community issues: Do the verses refer to the concerns of the early Christian community, such as instructions for missionaries or issues of leadership? For example, Peter as &quot;the rock&quot; on which Jesus builds his church (Matthew 16:17–19).
* Theological agenda: Do the verses support an opinion or outlook that is unique to the gospel, possibly indicating redactor bias? For example, the prophecy of the sheep and the goats (Matthew 25:31–46) received the color black because the fellows saw it as representing Matthew&#x27;s agenda of speaking out against unworthy members of the Christian community.

===Example: the beatitudes===
The Jesus Seminar rated various beatitudes as red, pink, gray, and black. Three beatitudes are judged to be &quot;paradoxical&quot; and are doubly attested. They are rated red (authentic) as they appear in Luke 6:20–21.

*&quot;Congratulations, you poor! God&#x27;s domain belongs to you.&quot;
*&quot;Congratulations, you hungry! You will have a feast.&quot;
*&quot;Congratulations, you who weep now! You will laugh.&quot;

The Seminar fellows decided the beatitude for those persecuted in Jesus&#x27; name might trace back to Jesus as a beatitude for those who suffer, but concluded that in its final form the saying represents concerns of the Christian community rather than Jesus&#x27; message. Thus it received a gray rating.

Matthew&#x27;s version of the three authentic beatitudes were rated pink. The author has spiritualized two of them, so that they now refer to the poor &quot;in spirit&quot; and to those who hunger &quot;and thirst for justice.&quot; Matthew also includes beatitudes for the meek, the merciful, the pure of heart, and peace-makers. These beatitudes have no second attestation, lack irony, and received a black rating.

== Principal publications ==
The Jesus Seminar produced a significant number of publications both in the form of journal articles and books published for the general public. Individual members of the seminar also produced, and continue to produce books which draw heavily upon the Seminar&#x27;s work. The following is a selected sampling of those publications; a complete list of Jesus Seminar publications may be found at the Polebridge Press website, the in-house publisher for the Westar Institute:

===Acts of Jesus===
In 1998 the Jesus Seminar published &quot;The Acts of Jesus: The Search for the Authentic Deeds of Jesus&quot;. To create the material for this book, they voted on the individual acts of Jesus as recorded in the gospels, much as they had previously voted on the individual sayings attributed to him.

According to the Jesus Seminar:
* Jesus of Nazareth was born during the reign of Herod the Great.
* His mother&#x27;s name was Mary, and he had a human father whose name may not have been Joseph.
* Jesus was born in Nazareth, not in Bethlehem.
* Jesus was an itinerant sage who shared meals with social outcasts.
* Jesus practiced faith healing without the use of ancient medicine or magic, relieving afflictions now modernly considered psychosomatic.
* He did not walk on water, feed the multitude with loaves and fishes, change water into wine or raise Lazarus from the dead.
* Jesus was arrested in Jerusalem and crucified by the Romans.
* He was executed as a public nuisance, not for claiming to be the Son of God.
* The empty tomb is a fiction – Jesus was not raised bodily from the dead.
* Belief in the resurrection is based on the visionary experiences of Paul, Peter and Mary Magdalene.

==Criticism from scholars==

The Jesus Seminar has come under intense criticism regarding its method, assumptions and conclusions from a wide array of scholars and laymen. Scholars who have expressed concerns with the work of the Jesus Seminar include Richard Hays, Ben Witherington, Greg Boyd, N.T. Wright, William Lane Craig, Luke Timothy Johnson, Craig A. Evans, Paul Barnett, Michael F. Bird, Craig Blomberg, Markus Bockmuehl, Raymond Brown, James D.G. Dunn, Howard Clark Kee, John P. Meier, Graham Stanton, Darrell Bock, and Edwin Yamauchi.

Jesuit theologian Gerald O&#x27;Collins has been critical of the methods and conclusions of the Jesus Seminar with particular attention to Christological ramifications.

Lutheran theologian Carl Braaten has been sharply critical, saying &quot;The Jesus Seminar is the latest example of a pseudo-scientific approach that is &#x27;dogmatically&#x27; opposed to basic Christian dogmas, popularizing in the public mind Harnack&#x27;s view that an unbridgeable gulf exists between Jesus and the church.&quot;

===Composition of the Seminar and qualifications of the members===

Luke Timothy Johnson, a historian of the origins of Christianity, argued that while some members of the seminar are reputable scholars (Borg, Crossan, Funk, others), others are relatively unknown or undistinguished in the field of biblical studies. One member, Paul Verhoeven, holds no Ph.D. but a M.Sc. in mathematics and physics, not biblical studies, and is best known as a film director. Johnson also critiqued the seminar for its attempts to gain the attention of the media for the 2000 ABC News program &quot;The Search for Jesus&quot; hosted by news anchor Peter Jennings.

Seminar critic William Lane Craig has argued that the self-selected members of the group do not represent the consensus of New Testament scholars. He writes:

Of the 74 [scholars] listed in their publication &quot;The Five Gospels&quot;, only 14 would be leading figures in the field of New Testament studies. More than half are basically unknowns, who have published only two or three articles. Eighteen of the fellows have published nothing at all in New Testament studies. Most have relatively undistinguished academic positions, for example, teaching at a community college.
Others have made the same point and have further indicated that thirty-six of those scholars, almost half, have a degree from or currently teach at one of three schools: Harvard, Claremont, or Vanderbilt University, all of which are considered to favor &quot;liberal&quot; interpretations of the New Testament. To open theist Greg Boyd, a prominent evangelical pastor and theologian, &quot;The Jesus Seminar represents an extremely small number of radical-fringe scholars who are on the far, far left wing of New Testament thinking. It does not represent mainstream scholarship.&quot; New Testament scholar Mark Allan Powell has stated: &quot;The Jesus Seminar is not representative of the guild of New Testament historical scholarship today. Rather, it is representative of one voice within that guild, a voice that actually espouses a minority position on some key issues.&quot;

In the first chapter of his 2010 book &quot;Jesus of Nazareth: An Independent Historian&#x27;s Account of his Life and Teaching&quot;, Maurice Casey, an irreligious British scholar of the New Testament, criticizes the Seminar for having not included &quot;some of the best scholars in the USA, such as E. P. Sanders, J. A. Fitzmyer, and Dale Allison.&quot; He states that these glaring omissions were compounded by the fact that many of the supposed &quot;experts&quot; at the Seminar were young, obscure scholars who had only just completed their doctorates.

===Flawed voting system===

The voting system has been criticized by, among others, N. T. Wright, who says: &quot;I cannot understand how, if a majority ... thought a saying authentic or probably authentic, the &#x27;weighted average&#x27; turned out to be &#x27;probably inauthentic&#x27;. A voting system that produces a result like this ought to be scrapped.&quot; Casey sums up the voting process stating, &quot;In practice, this meant an averaged majority vote by people who were not in any reasonable sense authorities at all.&quot;

===Influence of presuppositions===
Howard Clark Kee, Professor of Biblical Studies Emeritus at Boston University School of Theology, writing in the journal &quot;Theology Today&quot; stated, &quot;the conclusions reached by these scholars are inherent in the presuppositions and methods they have chosen to adopt from the outset.&quot;

Luke Timothy Johnson of the Candler School of Theology at Emory University, in his 1996 book &quot;The Real Jesus&quot;, voiced concerns with the seminar&#x27;s work. He criticized the techniques of the Seminar, believing them to be far more limited for historical reconstruction than seminar members believe. Their conclusions were &quot;already determined ahead of time,&quot; Johnson says, which &quot;is not responsible, or even critical scholarship. It is a self-indulgent .&quot; William Lane Craig argues that the principal presuppositions of scientific naturalism, the primacy of the apocryphal gospels, and the necessity of a politically correct Jesus are unjustified and issue in a distorted portrait of the historical Jesus.

Raymond Brown likewise avers that the Seminar &quot;operated to a remarkable degree on a priori principles, some of them reflecting antisupernatural bias. For instance, the bodily resurrection had no real chance of being accepted as having taken place. ... Again, almost as a principle, the eschatological character of Jesus&#x27; ministry has been dismissed...&quot;

Dale Allison of Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, in his 1998 book &quot;Jesus of Nazareth: Millenarian Prophet&quot;, cited what he felt were problems with the work of (particularly) John Dominic Crossan and Marcus Borg, arguing that their conclusions were at least in part predetermined by their theological positions. He also pointed out the limitations of their presumptions and methodology. Allison argued that despite the conclusions of the seminar, Jesus was a prophetic figure focused to a large extent on apocalyptic thinking. Several Bible scholars (for example Bart D. Ehrman, an agnostic, and Paula Fredriksen, a Jew) have reasserted Albert Schweitzer&#x27;s eschatological view of Jesus. Casey argues that the Jesus Seminar&#x27;s fundamental social goal was not to construct an accurate portrait of the historical Jesus, but rather to create &quot;a figure whom [the Fellows of the Seminar] are happy with&quot;. In particular, the fellows of the Seminar have removed &quot;the apocalyptic and eschatological concerns which characterize American fundamentalism&quot; and remade Jesus as &quot;a cynic philosopher, which suits their intellectual ambiance&quot;.

===Inappropriate emphasis on flawed criteria===
Numerous scholars have criticized the Seminar for placing too much value on the criterion of dissimilarity. For the Seminar, a saying will only be held as authentic if it does &quot;not&quot; match the beliefs of Judaism or those held by the early Christians. Critics such as Gregory Boyd have noted that the effect of this is that the Jesus of the Seminar shows no continuity with his Jewish context nor his disciples. Raymond Brown has stated that &quot;a rigorous application of such criteria would leave us with a monstrosity: a Jesus who never said, thought, or did anything that other Jews said, thought, or did, and a Jesus who had no connection or relationship to what his followers said, thought, or did in reference to him after he died.&quot; J. Ed Komoszewski and co-authors state that the Jesus Seminar&#x27;s &quot;Criteria for In/Authenticity&quot; creates &quot;an eccentric Jesus who learned nothing from his own culture and made no impact on his followers&quot;. The same criticism has been made by Craig Evans.

===Bias against canonical sources and for non-canonical sources===
Casey criticizes the Seminar for the &quot;exaggerated importance which they have attributed to the Gospel of Thomas&quot;, stating, &quot;Their voting was so bizarre that they ended up with more red in the Gospel than in our oldest genuine source, the Gospel of Mark.&quot; Craig Blomberg notes that if the Jesus Seminar&#x27;s findings are to be believed, then: Craig Evans argues that the Jesus Seminar applies a form of hypercriticism to the canonical gospels that unreasonably assumes that &quot;Jesus&#x27; contemporaries (that is, the first generation of his movement) were either incapable of remembering or uninterested in recalling accurately what Jesus said and did, and in passing it on&quot; while, in contrast, privileging extra-canonical texts with an uncritical acceptance that sometimes rises to the level of special pleading. Howard Clark Kee, writing in &quot;The Cambridge Companion to the Bible&quot; (1997) and citing Helmut Koester and John Dominic Crossan as examples, states: 

=== Other ===
Garry Wills, a vocal proponent of liberal Catholicism, nonetheless strongly critiques the Seminar:This is the new fundamentalism. It believes in the literal sense of the Bible—it just reduces to what it can take as literal quotation from Jesus. Though some have called the Jesus Seminarists radical, they are actually very conservative. They tame the real, radical, Jesus, cutting him down to their own size...the sayings that meet with the Seminar&#x27;s approval were preserved by the Christian communities whose contribution is discounted. Jesus as a person does not exist outside of the gospels, and the only reason he exists there is because of their authors&#x27; faith in the Resurrection. Trying to find a construct, &quot;the historical Jesus,&quot; is not like finding diamonds in a dunghill, but like finding New York City at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. 

==Conservative backlash==

In addition to scholarly critiques, a number of conservative Christian organizations were critical of the Jesus Seminar.

D. James Kennedy, senior pastor of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church, was critical of the Jesus Seminar and John Dominic Crossan, writing in his 1996 book &quot;The Gates of Hell Shall Not Prevail&quot;:

In response to the airing of a two-hour ABC News documentary titled &quot;The Search for Jesus&quot; in June 2000, which featured Jesus Seminar scholars including Marcus Borg and John Dominic Crossan, Coral Ridge Ministries produced the one-hour documentary &quot;Who Is This Jesus&quot;. Hosted by actor Dean Jones and D. James Kennedy, the film features ancient history scholar Paul L. Maier, and biblical scholars D.A. Carson, N.T. Wright, Gary Habermas, and Bruce Metzger. Also featured is evangelical apologist Josh McDowell. As Kennedy recalled later, &quot;We featured a wide variety of scholarly viewpoints... We set out to show the ample historical evidence that the Gospels are reliable, that the New Testament is the best-attested book in antiquity in quantity and quality of manuscripts, that Jesus is who He said He is, and that He rose from the dead.&quot; The film aired on Christmas Day 2000 on the PAX-TV network and a number of CBS affiliates. An expanded version of the film, titled &quot;Who Is This Jesus: Is He Risen?&quot;, aired at Easter 2001. The film aired again on &quot;The Coral Ridge Hour&quot; on Palm Sunday, 2005.

Similarly, in 2001 John Ankerberg, a Baptist apologist-theologian, host of The John Ankerberg Show, responded with &quot;The Search for Jesus: A Response to the ABC, NBC, CNN Specials about Jesus&quot;. The program featured biblical scholars Craig Blomberg, Gary Habermas, and N.T. Wright as well as philosopher-theologian William Lane Craig and Israeli archaeologist Gabriel Barkay.

Both &quot;The Watchman Expositor&quot; and &quot;The Christian Arsenal&quot; identify the Jesus Seminar as an attempt by Satan to twist the meaning of Scripture, founded in the liberalism, modernism, and neo-orthodoxy that are current in academia and mainline seminaries. Maurice Casey states:

==Current activities and fellows of the Jesus Seminar==
Members of the Jesus Seminar have responded to their critics in various books and dialogues, which typically defend both their methodology and their conclusions. Among these responses are &quot;The Jesus Seminar and Its Critics&quot; by Robert J. Miller, a member of the Seminar; &quot;The Apocalyptic Jesus: A Debate&quot;, a dialogue with Allison, Borg, Crossan, and Stephen Patterson; &quot;The Jesus Controversy: Perspectives in Conflict&quot;, a dialogue between Crossan, Johnson, and Werner H. Kelber. &quot;The Meaning of Jesus: Two Visions&quot;, by Borg and noted New Testament historian and Pauline scholar N. T. Wright demonstrated how two scholars with divergent theological positions can work together to creatively share and discuss their thoughts.

The Jesus seminar was active in the 1980s and 1990s. Early in the 21st century, another group called the &quot;Acts Seminar&quot; was formed by some previous members to follow similar approaches to biblical research.

In March 2006, the Jesus Seminar began work on a new description of the emergence of the Jesus traditions through the first two centuries of the common era (CE). In this new phase, fellows of the Jesus Seminar on Christian Origins employ the methods and techniques pioneered by the original Jesus Seminar.

Robert Funk died in 2005, Marcus Borg in 2015, Stephen L. Harris in 2019, and Burton Mack in 2022, but notable surviving fellows of the Jesus Seminar include John Dominic Crossan and Robert M. Price. Borg was a liberal Christian who articulated the vision hypothesis to explain Jesus&#x27; resurrection. Some view Crossan as an important voice in contemporary historical Jesus research, promoting the idea of a non-apocalyptic Jesus who preaches a sapiential eschatology. Funk was a well-known scholar of recent American research into Jesus&#x27; parables. Harris was the author of several books on religion, including university-level textbooks. Mack described Jesus as a Galilean Cynic, based on the elements of the Q document that he considers to be earliest.

<text>George Albert Wells (22 May 1926 – 23 January 2017) was an English scholar who served as Professor of German at Birkbeck, University of London. After writing books about famous European intellectuals, such as Johann Gottfried Herder and Franz Grillparzer, he turned to the study of the historicity of Jesus, starting with his book &quot;The Jesus of the Early Christians&quot; in 1971. He is best known as an advocate of the thesis that Jesus is essentially a mythical rather than a historical figure, a theory that was pioneered by German biblical scholars such as Bruno Bauer and Arthur Drews.

From the late 1990s, Wells said that the hypothetical Q document, which is proposed as a source used in some of the gospels, may &quot;contain a core of reminiscences&quot; of an itinerant Galilean miracle-worker/Cynic-sage type preacher. This new stance has been interpreted as Wells changing his position to accept the existence of a historical Jesus. In 2003, Wells stated that he disagreed with Robert M. Price on the information about Jesus being &quot;all mythical&quot;. Wells believed that the Jesus of the gospels is obtained by attributing the supernatural traits of the Pauline epistles to the human preacher of Q. In 2012, Wells reaffirmed that he agreed that Jesus existed and acknowledged he had changed his stance.

Wells was Chairman of the Rationalist Press Association. He was married and lived in St. Albans, near London. He studied at the University of London and Bern, and held degrees in German, philosophy, and natural science. Wells taught German at London University from 1949, and was Professor of German at Birkbeck College from 1968.

==Work on early Christianity==
Wells&#x27;s fundamental observation is to suggest that the earliest extant Christian documents from the first century, most notably the New Testament epistles by Paul and some other writers, show no familiarity with the gospel figure of Jesus as a preacher and miracle-worker who lived and died in the recent decades. Rather, the early Christian epistles present him &quot;as a basically supernatural personage only obscurely on Earth as a man at some unspecified period in the past&quot;. Wells believed that the Jesus of these earliest Christians was not based on a historical character, but a pure myth, derived from mystical speculations based on the Jewish Wisdom figure.

In his early trilogy (1971, 1975, 1982), Wells argued that the gospel Jesus is an entirely mythical expansion of a Jewish Wisdom figure—the Jesus of the early epistles—who lived in some past, unspecified time period. In addition, Wells wrote, the texts are exclusively Christian and theologically motivated, and therefore a rational person should believe the gospels only if they are independently confirmed.

In his later trilogy from the mid-1990s; &quot;The Jesus Legend&quot; (1996), &quot;The Jesus Myth&quot; (1999), and &quot;Can We Trust the New Testament?&quot; (2004), Wells modified and expanded his initial thesis to include a historical Galilean preacher from the Q source:
I propose here that the disparity between the early [New Testament] documents and the [later] gospels is explicable if the Jesus of the former is not the same person as the Jesus of the latter. Some elements in the ministry of the gospel Jesus are arguably traceable to the activity of a Galilean preacher of the early first century, who figures in what is known as Q (an abbreviation for &quot;Quelle&quot;, German for ‘source’). Q supplied the gospels of Matthew and Luke with much of their material concerning Jesus’s Galilean preaching. [...] In my first books on Jesus, I argued that the gospel Jesus is an entirely mythical expansion of the Jesus of the early epistles. The summary of the argument of the &quot;Jesus Legend&quot; (1996) and the &quot;Jesus Myth&quot; (1999) given in this section of the present work makes it clear that I no longer maintain this position. The weakness of my earlier position was pressed upon me by J.D.G. Dunn, who objected that we really cannot plausibly assume that such a complex of traditions as we have in the gospels and their sources could have developed within such a short time from the early epistles without a historical basis (Dunn, [&quot;The Evidence for Jesus&quot;] 1985, p. 29). My present standpoint is: this complex is not all post-Pauline [there is also a historical Galilean preacher from the Q source] (Q, or at any rate parts of it, may well be as early as ca. A.D. 50); and if I am right, against Doherty and Price - it is not all mythical. The essential point, as I see it, is that the Q material, whether or not it suffices as evidence of Jesus&#x27;s historicity, refers to a [human] personage who is not to be identified with the [mythical] dying and rising Christ of the early epistles. (&quot;Can We Trust the NT?&quot;, 2004, pp. 43, 49–50).

Wells clarified his position in &quot;The Jesus Legend&quot;, that &quot;Paul sincerely believed that the evidence (not restricted to the Wisdom literature) pointed to a historical Jesus who had lived well before his own day; and I leave open the question as to whether such a person had in fact existed and lived the obscure life that Paul supposed of him. (There is no means of deciding this issue.)&quot;

With this, Wells allowed for the possibility that the central figure of the gospel stories may partly be based on a historical character from first-century Galilee: &quot;[T]he Galilean and the Cynic elements ... may contain a core of reminiscences of an itinerant Cynic-type Galilean preacher (who, however, is certainly not to be identified with the Jesus of the earliest Christian documents).&quot; Sayings and memories of this preacher may have been preserved in the &quot;Q&quot; document that is hypothesized as the source of many &quot;sayings&quot; of Jesus found in both gospels of Matthew and Luke. However, Wells concluded that the reconstruction of this historical figure from the extant literature would be a hopeless task.What we have in the gospels is surely a fusion of two originally quite independent streams of tradition, ...the Galilean preacher of the early first century who had met with rejection, and the supernatural personage of the early epistles, [the Jesus of Paul] who sojourned briefly on Earth and then, rejected, returned to heaven—have been condensed into one. The [human] preacher has been given a [mythical] salvific death and resurrection, and these have been set not in an unspecified past (as in the early epistles) but in a historical context consonant with the Galilean preaching. The fusion of the two figures will have been facilitated by the fact that both owe quite a lot of their substance in the documents—to ideas very important in the Jewish Wisdom literature. (&quot;Cutting Jesus Down to Size&quot;, 2009, p. 16)

The updated position taken by Wells was interpreted by other scholars as an &quot;about-face&quot;, abandoning his initial thesis in favor of accepting the existence of a historical Jesus. However, Wells insisted that this figure of late first-century gospel stories is distinct from the sacrificial Christ myth of Paul&#x27;s epistles and other early Christian documents, and that these two figures have different sources before being fused in Mark, writing, &quot;if I am right, against Doherty and Price - it is not all mythical.&quot; Wells notes that he belongs in the category of those who argue that Jesus did exist, but that reports about Jesus are so unreliable that we can know little or nothing about him. Wells argues, for example, that the story of the execution of Jesus under Pilate is not an historical account, writing, &quot;I regarded (and still do regard) [the following stories;] the virgin birth, much in the Galilean ministry, the crucifixion around A.D. 30 under Pilate, and the resurrection—as legendary&quot;. Many scholars still note Wells as a mythicist.

==Reception==
Co-author R. Joseph Hoffmann has called Wells &quot;the most articulate contemporary defender of the non-historicity thesis.&quot; Wells&#x27; claim of a mythical Jesus has received support from Earl Doherty, Robert M. Price and others. The classical historian R. E. Witt, reviewing &quot;The Jesus of the Early Christians&quot; in the &quot;Journal of Hellenic Studies&quot;, offered some criticisms but concluded that &quot;Hellenists should welcome the appearance of this challenging book.&quot;

However, Wells&#x27; conclusions have been criticized by biblical scholars and ecclesiastical historians such as W. H. C. Frend and Robert E. Van Voorst. Voorst further critiques Wells work as &quot;[Wells] advanced the non-historicity hypothesis, not for objective reasons, but for highly tendentious, anti-religious purposes.&quot; Historian David Aikman from Patrick Henry College criticizes Wells&#x27; lack of expertise and objectivity: &quot;Wells is not a New Testament specialist at all but a professor of German and a former chairman of the Rationalist Press Association. He has written several books rejecting the historicity of Jesus, a position almost no New Testament scholar endorses, even those who are radically opposed to Christianity.&quot; Wells featured in the controversial Channel 4 television series about the historicity of Jesus, &quot;Jesus: The Evidence&quot; (LWT: 1984).

After reviewing criticisms from several authors, atheist philosopher Michael Martin said that although &quot;Wells&#x27;s thesis is controversial and not widely accepted,&quot; his &quot;argument against the historicity of Jesus is sound&quot;.

Bart Ehrman, in his &quot;Did Jesus Exist? (Ehrman)&quot; (2012) stated: &quot;The best-known mythicist of modern times — at least among the NT scholars who know of any mythicists at all — is George A. Wells...He has written many books and articles advocating a mythicist position, none more incisive than his 1975 book, &quot;Did Jesus Exist?&quot;. Wells is certainly one who does the hard legwork to make his case: Although an outsider to NT studies, he speaks the lingo of the field and has read deeply in its scholarship. Although most NT scholars will not (or do not) consider his work either convincing or particularly well argued.&quot; (p. 19). Wells provided an answer to these points in an article in &quot;Free Inquiry&quot;.

<doc id="158636" wikidata="Q240633" url="?curid=158636" title="James Nasmyth">
<text>James Hall Nasmyth (sometimes spelled Naesmyth, Nasmith, or Nesmyth) (19 August 1808 – 7 May 1890) was a Scottish engineer, philosopher, artist and inventor famous for his development of the steam hammer. He was the co-founder of Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company manufacturers of machine tools. He retired at the age of 48, and moved to Penshurst, Kent where he developed his hobbies of astronomy and photography.

==Early life==
Nasmyth was born at 47 York Place, Edinburgh where his father Alexander Nasmyth was a landscape and portrait painter. One of Alexander&#x27;s hobbies was mechanics and he employed nearly all his spare time in his workshop where he encouraged his youngest son to work with him in all sorts of materials. James was sent to the Royal High School where he had as a friend, Jimmy Patterson, the son of a local iron founder. Being already interested in mechanics he spent much of his time at the foundry and there he gradually learned to work and turn in wood, brass, iron, and steel. In 1820 he left the High School and again made great use of his father&#x27;s workshop where at the age of 17, he made his first steam engine.

From 1821 to 1826, Nasmyth regularly attended the Edinburgh School of Arts (today Heriot-Watt University, 
making him one of the first students of the institution). In 1828 he made a complete steam carriage that was capable of running a mile carrying 8 passengers. This accomplishment increased his desire to become a mechanical engineer. He had heard of the fame of Henry Maudslay&#x27;s workshop and resolved to get employment there; unfortunately his father could not afford to place him as an apprentice at Maudslay&#x27;s works. Nasmyth therefore decided instead to show Maudslay examples of his skills and produced a complete working model of a high-pressure steam engine, creating the working drawings and constructing the components himself.

==Career==
In May 1829, Nasmyth visited Maudslay in London, and after showing him his work was engaged as an assistant workman at 10 shillings a week. Unfortunately, Maudslay died two years later, whereupon Nasmyth was taken on by Maudslay&#x27;s partner as a draughtsman.

When Nasmyth was 23 years old, having saved the sum of £69, he decided to set up in business on his own. He rented a factory flat 130 feet long by 27 feet wide at an old cotton mill on Dale Street, Manchester.

The combination of massive castings and a wooden floor was not an ideal one, and after an accident involving one end of an engine beam crashing through the floor into a glass cutters flat below he soon relocated. He moved to Patricroft, an area of the town of Eccles, Lancashire, where in August 1836, he and his business partner Holbrook Gaskell opened the Bridgewater Foundry, where they traded as Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company. The premises were constructed adjacent to the (then new) Liverpool and Manchester Railway and the Bridgewater Canal.

In March 1838 James was making a journey by coach from Sheffield to York in a snowstorm, when he spied some ironwork furnaces in the distance. The coachman informed him that they were managed by a Mr. Hartop who was one of his customers. He immediately got off the coach and headed for the furnaces through the deep snow. He found Mr. Hartop at his house, and was invited to stay the night and visit the works the next day. That evening he met Hartop&#x27;s family and was immediately smitten by his 21-year-old daughter, Anne. A decisive man, the next day he told her of his feelings and intentions, which was received &quot;in the best spirit that I could desire.&quot; He then communicated the same to her parents, and told them his prospects, and so became betrothed in the same day. They were married two years later, on 16 June 1840 in Wentworth.

Up to 1843, Nasmyth, Gaskell &amp; Co. concentrated on producing a wide range of machine tools in large numbers. By 1856, Nasmyth had built 236 shaping machines.

In 1840 he began to receive orders from the newly opened railways which were beginning to cover the country, for locomotives. His connection with the Great Western Railway whose famous steamship SS &quot;Great Western&quot; had been so successful in voyages between Bristol and New York, led to him being asked to make some machine tools of unusual size and power which were required for the construction of the engines of their next and bigger ship SS &quot;Great Britain&quot;.

===The steam hammer===
In 1837, the Great Western Steam Company was experiencing many problems forging the paddle shaft of the SS &quot;Great Britain&quot;; when even the largest hammer was tilted to its full height its range was so small that if a really large piece of work were placed on the anvil, the hammer had no room to fall, and in 1838 the company&#x27;s engineer (Francis Humphries) wrote to Nasmyth: &quot;I find there is not a forge-hammer in England or Scotland powerful enough to forge the paddle-shaft of the engine for the Great Britain! What am I to do?”

Nasmyth thought the matter over and seeing the obvious defects of the tilt-hammer (it delivered every blow with the same force) sketched out his idea for the first steam hammer. He kept his ideas for new devices, mostly in drawings, in a &quot;Scheme Book&quot; which he freely showed to his foreign customers. Nasmyth made a sketch of his steam hammer design dated 24 November 1839, but the immediate need disappeared when the practicality of screw propellers was demonstrated and the &quot;Great Britain&quot; was converted to that design.

The French engineer François Bourdon came up with the similar idea of what he called a &quot;Pilon&quot; in 1839 and made detailed drawings of his design, which he also showed to all engineers who visited the works at Le Creusot owned by the brothers Adolphe and Eugène Schneider.
However, the Schneiders hesitated to build Bourdon&#x27;s radical new machine.
Bourdon and Eugène Schneider visited the Nasmyth works in England in the middle of 1840, where they were shown Nasmyth&#x27;s sketch.
This confirmed the feasibility of the concept to Schneider. 
In 1840 Bourdon built the first steam hammer in the world at the Schneider &amp; Cie works at Le Creusot.
It weighed and lifted to . The Schneiders patented the design in 1841.

In April 1842 Nasmyth visited France with a view to supplying the French arsenals and dockyards with tools and while he was there took the opportunity to visit the Le Creusot works. On going round the works, he found the steam-hammer at work. 
By his account, Bourdon took him to the forge department so he might, as he said, &quot;see his own child&quot;. Nasmyth said &quot;there it was, in truth–a thumping child of my brain!&quot;
Nasmyth patented his design in June 1842 using money borrowed from his sister Anne&#x27;s husband William Bennett. He built his first steam hammer later that year in his Patricroft foundry.
In 1843 a dispute broke out between the two engineers over priority of invention of the steam hammer.

By using the hammer, production costs could be reduced by over 50 percent, while at the same time improving the quality of the forgings produced.

The first hammers were of the free-fall type but they were later modified, given power-assisted fall. Up until then, the invention of Nasmyth&#x27;s steam-hammer, large forging, such as ships&#x27; anchors, had to be made by the &quot;bit-by-bit&quot; process, that is, small pieces were forged separately and finally welded together. A key feature of his machine was that the operator controlled the force of each blow. He enjoyed showing off its capability by demonstrating how it could first break an egg placed in a wine glass, without breaking the glass, which was followed by a full-force blow which shook the building. Its advantages soon became so obvious that before long Nasmyth hammers were to be found in all the large workshops all over the country.

An original Nasmyth hammer now stands facing Nasmyth&#x27;s Patricroft foundry buildings (now a &#x27;business park&#x27;). A larger Nasmyth &amp; Wilson steam hammer stands in the campus of the University of Bolton.

Nasmyth subsequently applied the principle of his steam hammer to a pile-driving machine which he invented in 1843. His first full scale machine used a four-ton hammer-block, and a rate of eighty blows per minute. The pile driver was first demonstrated in a contest with a team using the conventional method at Devonport on 3 July 1845. He drove a pile 70 feet long and 18 inches squared in four and a half minutes, while the conventional method required twelve hours. This was a great success, and many orders for his pile driver resulted. It was used for many large scale constructions all over the world in the next few years, such as the High Level Bridge at Newcastle upon Tyne and the Nile barrage at Aswan, Egypt (Aswan Low Dam).

By 1856 a total of 490 hammers had been produced which were sold across Europe to Russia, India and even Australia, and accounted for 40% of James Nasmyth and Company&#x27;s revenues.

===Other inventions===
Apart from the steam hammer, Nasmyth created several other important machine tools, including the shaper, an adaptation of the planer which is still used in tool and die making. Another innovation was a hydraulic press which used water pressure to force tight-fitting machine parts together. All of these machines became popular in manufacturing, and all are still in use in modified form.

Nasmyth was also one of the first toolmakers to offer a standardised range of machine tools; before this, manufacturers constructed tools according to individual clients&#x27; specifications with little regard to standardisation, which caused compatibility problems. Nasmyth was arguably the last of the early pioneers of the machine tool industry.

Among Nasmyth&#x27;s other inventions, most of which he never patented, were a means of transmitting rotary motion by means of a flexible shaft made of coiled wire, a machine for cutting key grooves, self-adjusting bearings, and the screw ladle for moving molten metal which could safely and efficiently be handled by two men instead of the six previously required. Nasmyth&#x27;s idea of a steam ram for naval warfare was never put into production.

In 1844 he, together with engineer Charles May, patented the first Vacuum brake.

Although milling machines were no longer novel by 1830, an example built by Nasmyth around that time stands out for its prescience. It was tooled to mill the six sides of a hex nut that was mounted in a six-way indexing fixture.

He also worked on a project for the conversion of iron which was not dis-similar to that which was eventually patented by Henry Bessemer. A reluctant patentor, and in this instance still working through some problems in his method, Nasmyth abandoned the project after hearing of Bessemer&#x27;s ideas in 1856. Bessemer, however, acknowledged the efforts of Nasmyth by offering him a one-third share of the value of his patent for the eponymous Bessemer process. Nasmyth turned it down as he had decided to retire.

===Later life===
Nasmyth retired from business in 1856 when he was 48 years old, as he said &quot;I have now enough of this world&#x27;s goods: let younger men have their chance&quot;. He settled down near Penshurst, Kent, where he renamed his retirement home &quot;Hammerfield&quot; and happily pursued his various hobbies including astronomy. He built his own 20-inch reflecting telescope, in the process inventing the Nasmyth focus, and made detailed observations of the Moon. He co-wrote &quot;The Moon: Considered as a Planet, a World, and a Satellite&quot; (1874) with James Carpenter (1840–1899). This book contains an interesting series of &quot;lunar&quot; photographs: because photography was not yet advanced enough to take pictures at very high magnification directly of the Moon itself, Nasmyth built plaster relief scale models based on his visual observations of the Moon and then photographed the models under electric illumination, replicating the shadows of the topographic contours he observed on the Moon. A crater on the Moon is named after him.

He was happily married to his wife Anne, from Woodburn, Yorkshire, for 50 years, until his death. They had no children.

They are buried in the north section of the Dean Cemetery in western Edinburgh. The huge memorial stands at the east end of the main east–west path, with the path dividing around it. The monument holds a well-carved model of his steam hammer. James&#x27; mother, Barbara Foulis (1765-1848) is buried with them. The monument also stands as a memorial to his brother, Patrick Nasmyth (1787-1831)

==Recognition==
In memory of his renowned contribution to the discipline of mechanical engineering, the Department of Mechanical Engineering building at Heriot-Watt University, in his birthplace of Edinburgh, is called the James Nasmyth Building.

<doc id="158638" wikidata="Q1642623" url="?curid=158638" title="Usability engineering">
<text>Usability engineering is a professional discipline that focuses on improving the usability of interactive systems. It draws on theories from computer science and psychology to define problems that occur during the use of such a system. Usability Engineering involves the testing of designs at various stages of the development process, with users or with usability experts. The history of usability engineering in this context dates back to the 1980s. In 1988, authors John Whiteside and John Bennett—of Digital Equipment Corporation and IBM, respectively—published material on the subject, isolating the early setting of goals, iterative evaluation, and prototyping as key activities. The usability expert Jakob Nielsen is a leader in the field of usability engineering. In his 1993 book &quot;Usability Engineering&quot;, Nielsen describes methods to use throughout a product development process—so designers can ensure they take into account the most important barriers to learnability, efficiency, memorability, error-free use, and subjective satisfaction &quot;before&quot; implementing the product. Nielsen’s work describes how to perform usability tests and how to use usability &quot;heuristics&quot; in the usability engineering lifecycle. Ensuring good usability via this process prevents problems in product adoption after release. Rather than focusing on finding solutions for usability problems—which is the focus of a UX or interaction designer—a usability engineer mainly concentrates on the &quot;research phase&quot;. In this sense, it is not strictly a design role, and many usability engineers have a background in computer science because of this. Despite this point, its connection to the design trade is absolutely crucial, not least as it delivers the framework by which designers can work so as to be sure that their products will connect properly with their target usership.

== International standards ==

Usability engineers sometimes work to shape an interface such that it adheres to accepted operational definitions of user requirements documentation. For example, the International Organization for Standardization approved definitions (see e.g., ISO 9241 part 11) usability are held by some to be a context, efficiency, and satisfaction with which specific users should be able to perform tasks. Advocates of this approach engage in task analysis, then prototype interface design, and usability testing on those designs. On the basis of such tests, the technology is potentially redesigned if necessary.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology has collaborated with industry to develop the Common Industry Specification for Usability – Requirements, which serves as a guide for many industry professionals. The specifications for successful usability in biometrics were also developed by the NIST. Usability.gov, a no-longer maintained website formerly operated by the US General Services Administration, provided a tutorial and wide general reference for the design of usable websites.

Usability, especially with the goal of Universal Usability, encompasses the standards and guidelines of design for accessibility. The aim of these guidelines is to facilitate the use of a software application for people with disabilities. Some guidelines for web accessibility are:

#The Web Accessibility Initiative Guidelines.
#The Section 508 government guidelines applicable to all public-sector websites.
#The ADA Guidelines for accessibility of state and local government websites.
#The IBM Guidelines for accessibility of websites.

== Errors ==
In usability engineering, it&#x27;s important target and identify human errors when interacting with the product of interest because if a user is expected to engage with a product, interface, or service in some way, the very introduction of a human in that engagement increases the potential of encountering human error. Error should be reduced as much as possible in order to avoid frustration or injury. There are two main types of human errors which are categorized as slips and mistakes. Slips are a very common kind of error involving automatic behaviors (i.e. typos, hitting the wrong menu item). When we experience slips, we have the correct goal in mind, but execute the wrong action.
Mistakes on the other hand involve conscious deliberation that result in the incorrect conclusion. When we experience mistakes, we have the wrong goal in mind and thereby execute the wrong action.

Even though slips are the more common type of error, they are no less dangerous. A certain type of slip error, a mode error, can be especially dangerous if a user is executing a high-risk task. For instance, if a user is operating a vehicle and does not realize they are in the wrong mode (i.e. reverse), they might step on the gas intending to drive, but instead accelerate into a garage wall or another car. In order to avoid modal errors, designers often employ modeless states in which users do not have to choose a mode at all, or they must execute a continuous action while intending to execute a certain mode (i.e. pressing a key continuously in order to activate &quot;lasso&quot; mode in Photoshop).

== Evaluation methods ==
Usability engineers conduct usability evaluations of existing or proposed interfaces and their findings are fed back to the designer for use in design or redesign. Common usability evaluation methods include:
*Card sorting
*Cognitive task analysis
*Cognitive walkthroughs
*Contextual inquiry
*Focus groups
*Heuristic evaluations
*Interviews
*Questionnaires
*RITE method
*Surveys
*Think aloud protocol
*Usability testing

== Software applications and development tools ==
There are a variety of online resources that make the job of a usability engineer a little easier. Online tools are only a useful tool, and do not substitute for a complete usability engineering analysis. Some examples of these include:

=== The Web Metrics Tool Suite ===
This is a product of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This toolkit is focused on evaluating the HTML of a website versus a wide range of usability guidelines and includes:
* Web Static Analyzer Tool (WebSAT) – checks web page HTML against typical usability guidelines
* Web Category Analysis Tool (WebCAT) – lets the usability engineer construct and conduct a web category analysis
* Web Variable Instrumenter Program (WebVIP) – instruments a website to capture a log of user interaction
* Framework for Logging Usability Data (FLUD) – a file format and parser for representation of user interaction logs
* FLUDViz Tool – produces a 2D visualization of a single user session
* VisVIP Tool – produces a 3D visualization of user navigation paths through a website
* TreeDec – adds navigation aids to the pages of a website

=== The Usability Testing Environment (UTE) ===
This tool is produced by Mind Design Systems is available freely to federal government employees. According to the official company website this tool consists of two tightly-integrated applications. The first is the UTE Manager, which helps a tester set up test scenarios (tasks) as well as survey and demographic questions. The UTE Manager also compiles the test results and produces customized reports and summary data, which can be used as quantitative measures of usability observations and recommendations.

The second UTE application is the UTE Runner. The UTE Runner presents the test participants with the test scenarios (tasks) as well as any demographic and survey questions. In addition, the UTE Runner tracks the actions of the subject throughout the test including clicks, keystrokes, and scrolling.

=== The UsableNet Liftmachine ===
This tool is a product of UsableNet.com and implements the section 508 Usability and Accessibility guidelines as well as the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative Guidelines.

<doc id="158639" wikidata="Q936499" url="?curid=158639" title="Henry Maudslay">
<text>Henry Maudslay (pronunciation and spelling) (22 August 1771 – 14 February 1831) was an English machine tool innovator, tool and die maker, and inventor. He is considered a founding father of machine tool technology. His inventions were an important foundation for the Industrial Revolution.

Maudslay&#x27;s invention of a metal lathe to cut metal, circa 1800, enabled the manufacture of standard screw thread sizes. Standard screw thread sizes allowed interchangeable parts and the development of mass production.

==Early life==
Maudslay was the fifth of seven children of Henry Maudslay, a wheelwright in the Royal Engineers, and Margaret (&quot;nee&quot; Whitaker), the young widow of Joseph Laundy. His father was wounded in action and so in 1756 became an &#x27;artificer&#x27; at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich (then in Kent), where he remained until 1776 and died in 1780. The family lived in an alley that no longer exists, off Beresford Square, between Powis Street and Beresford Street.

==Career==
Maudslay began work at the age of 12 as a &quot;powder monkey&quot;, one of the boys employed in filling cartridges at the Arsenal. After two years, he was transferred to a carpenter&#x27;s shop followed by a blacksmith&#x27;s forge, where at the age of fifteen he began training as a blacksmith. He seems to have specialised in the lighter, more complex kind of forge work. During his time at the Arsenal, Maudslay also worked at the Royal Foundry, where Jan Verbruggen had installed an innovative horizontal boring machine in 1772.

===Joseph Bramah===
Maudslay acquired such a good reputation that Joseph Bramah called for his services on the recommendation of one of his employees. Bramah was surprised that he was only eighteen, but Maudslay demonstrated his ability and started work at Bramah&#x27;s workshop in Denmark Street, St Giles.Keith Reginald Gilbert

====Bramah lock====
Bramah designed and patented an improved type of lock based on the tumbler principle, but had difficulty manufacturing at an economic price. Maudslay built the lock that was displayed in Bramah&#x27;s shop window with a notice offering a reward of 200 guineas to anyone who could pick it. It resisted all efforts for 47 years. Maudslay designed and made a set of special tools and machines that allowed the lock to be made at an economic price.

====Hydraulic press====
Bramah had designed a hydraulic press, but was having problems sealing both the piston and the piston rod where it fitted into the cylinder. The usual method was hemp packing but the pressures were too high for this to work. Maudslay came up with the idea of a leather cup washer, which gave a perfect seal but offered no resistance to movement when the pressure was released. The new hydraulic press worked perfectly thereafter. But Maudslay, who had made a major contribution to its success, received little credit for it.

====Screw cutting lathe====
Maudslay developed the first industrially practical screw-cutting lathe in 1800, allowing standardisation of screw thread sizes for the first time. This allowed the concept of interchangeable parts (an idea that was already taking hold) to be practically applied to nuts and bolts.

When Maudslay began working for Bramah, the typical lathe was worked by a treadle and the workman held the cutting tool against the work. This did not allow for precision, especially in cutting iron, so screw threads were usually made by chipping and filing (that is, with skilled freehand use of chisels and files). Nuts were rare; metal screws, when made at all, were usually for use in wood. Metal bolts passing through wood framing to a metal fastening on the other side were usually fastened in non-threaded ways (such as clinching or upsetting against a washer).

Maudslay designed a tool holder into which the cutting tool would be clamped, and which would slide on accurately planed surfaces to allow the cutting tool to move in either direction. The slide rest was positioned by a leadscrew to which power was transmitted through a pair of changeable gears so that it traveled in proportion to the turning of the work. This allowed screw threads to be precisely cut. Changing the gears gave various pitches. The ability of the slide-rest lathe to produce precision parts revolutionised the production of machine components. He standardized the screw threads used in his workshop and produced sets of taps and dies that would make nuts and bolts consistently to those standards, so that any bolt of the appropriate size would fit any nut of the same size. This was a major advance in workshop technology.

Maudslay did not invent the slide-rest (as others such as James Nasmyth have claimed), and may not have been the first to combine a lead screw, slide-rest, and set of change gears all on one lathe (Jesse Ramsden may have done that in 1775; evidence is scant), but he did introduce the three-part combination of lead screw, slide rest, and change gears, sparking a great advance in machine tools and in the engineering use of screw threads.

Maudslay&#x27;s original screw-cutting lathe is at the Science Museum in London.

====Promotion and ambition====
Maudslay had shown himself to be so talented that after one year the nineteen-year-old was made manager of Bramah&#x27;s workshop.

=== Henry Maudslay and Company ===
In 1797, after having worked for Bramah for eight years, Maudslay was refused a wage increase to 30s a week so he decided to set up his own business. In 1798 he obtained a small shop and smithy in Wells Street, off Oxford Street. In 1800 he moved to larger premises in Margaret Street, Cavendish Square.

By 1810, Maudslay was employing 80 workers and running out of room at his workshop, hence moved to larger premises in Westminster Bridge 
Road, Lambeth. Maudslay also recruited a promising young Admiralty draughtsman, Joshua Field, who proved to be so talented that Maudslay took him into partnership. The company later became Maudslay, Sons and Field when Maudslay&#x27;s sons became partners.

====Block making machines====

Following earlier work by Samuel Bentham, his first major commission was to build a series of 42 woodworking machines to produce wooden rigging blocks (each ship required thousands) for the Navy under Sir Marc Isambard Brunel. The machines were installed in the purpose-built Portsmouth Block Mills, which still survive, including some of the original machinery. The machines were capable of making 130,000 ships&#x27; blocks a year, needing only ten unskilled men to operate them compared with the 110 skilled workers needed before their installation. This was the first well-known example of specialized machinery used for machining in an assembly-line type factory.

====Micrometer====
Maudslay invented the first bench micrometer capable of measuring to one ten-thousandth of an inch (0.0001 in ≈ 3 μm). He called it the &quot;Lord Chancellor&quot;, as it was used to settle any questions regarding accuracy of workmanship.

====Marine engines====

Maudslay&#x27;s Lambeth works began to specialize in the production of marine steam engines. The type of engine he used for ships was a side-lever design, in which a beam was mounted alongside the cylinder. This reduced height in the cramped engine rooms of steamers. His first marine engine was built in 1815, of 17 h.p., and fitted to a Thames steamer named the &quot;Richmond&quot;. In 1823 a Maudslay engine powered the &quot;Lightning&quot;, the first steam-powered vessel to be commissioned by the Royal Navy. In 1829 a side-lever engine of 400 h.p. completed for was the largest marine engine existing at that time.

The marine engine business was developed by Henry&#x27;s third son, Joseph Maudslay (1801 - 1861). He had trained in shipbuilding at Northfleet and, with Joshua Field, became a partner in his father&#x27;s firm, trading as Maudslay, Sons and Field of North Lambeth. 
In 1838, after Henry&#x27;s death, the Lambeth works supplied a 750 h.p. engine for Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s SS &quot;Great Western&quot;, the first purpose-built transatlantic steamship. They patented a double cylinder direct acting engine in 1839. They introduced some of the earliest screw propulsion units for ships, including one for the first Admiralty screw steamship, , in 1841. By 1850 the firm had supplied more than 200 vessels with steam engines, though the firm&#x27;s dominance was being challenged by John Penn&#x27;s trunk engine design. They exhibited their engines at the 1862 International Exhibition.

====Thames Tunnel====
In 1825, Marc Isambard Brunel began work on the Thames Tunnel, intended to link Rotherhithe with Wapping. After many difficulties this first tunnel under the Thames was completed in 1842. The tunnel would not have been possible without the innovative tunneling shield designed by Marc Brunel and built by Maudslay Sons &amp; Field at their Lambeth works. Maudslay also supplied the steam-driven pumps that were important for keeping the tunnel workings dry.

==Personal life==

In 1791 he married Bramah&#x27;s housemaid, Sarah Tindel, together they had a daughter Isabel Maudslay and four sons: Thomas Henry, the eldest, and Joseph, the youngest, subsequently joined their father in business. William, the second, became a civil engineer and was one of the founders of the Institution of Civil Engineers.

===Later life===
Near the end of his life Maudslay developed an interest in astronomy and began to construct a telescope. He intended to buy a house in Norwood and build a private observatory there, but died before he was able to accomplish his plan. In January 1831 he caught a chill while crossing the English Channel after visiting a friend in France. He was ill for four weeks and died on 14 February 1831. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary Magdalen Woolwich; he designed the memorial located in its Lady Chapel.

==Legacy==

Maudslay laid an important foundation for the Industrial Revolution with his machine tool technology. His most influential invention was the screw-cutting lathe. The machine, which created uniformity in screws and allowed for the application of interchangeable parts (a prerequisite for mass production), was a revolutionary development necessary for the Industrial Revolution.

Many outstanding engineers trained in his workshop, including Richard Roberts, David Napier, Joseph Clement, Sir Joseph Whitworth, James Nasmyth (inventor of the steam hammer), Joshua Field. Maudslay played his part in the development of mechanical engineering when it was in its infancy, but he was especially pioneering in the development of machine tools to be used in engineering workshops across the world.

Maudslay&#x27;s company was one of the most important British engineering manufactories of the nineteenth century, finally closing in 1904.

Many of the tools made by Maudslay are in the collection of the Science Museum, London.

==Pronunciation and spelling==
In Maudslay&#x27;s surname, as in other British names with terminal unstressed syllable &quot;-ay&quot; such as &quot;Lindsay&quot; or &quot;Barclay&quot;, the terminal syllable is pronounced as // or a reduction thereof; it therefore sounds the same as &quot;Maudsley&quot; . Many books have spelled his surname with an &quot;e&quot; as &quot;Maudsley&quot;; but this seems to be an error propagated via citation of earlier books containing the same error.

<text>André Masséna, prince d&#x27;Essling, duc de Rivoli (; born Andrea Massena; 6 May 1758 – 4 April 1817), was a French military commander of the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. He was one of the original eighteen Marshals of the Empire created by Napoleon I, who nicknamed him &quot;the dear child of victory&quot; (). He is considered to be one of the greatest generals of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.

Beginning his career as an enlisted soldier under the &quot;ancien régime&quot;, Masséna established himself as one of the best generals of the French Republic during the French Revolutionary Wars. He served as Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s main lieutenant in the Italian campaign of the War of the First Coalition, playing a decisive role in the victories of Arcole and Rivoli, and was at the helm of the advance into Austrian territory that compelled them to open peace negotiations. In 1799, Masséna defeated Second Coalition forces at the Second Battle of Zurich, which had considerable strategic repercussions for France. 

Under the French Empire, Masséna continued to demonstrate great competence in his various commands, both under Napoleon&#x27;s direct orders and at the head of independent forces in secondary fronts. He campaigned in Italy once again in 1805, invaded the Kingdom of Naples in 1806 and played a major role at the battles of Aspern-Essling and Wagram in 1809. Masséna was rewarded by Napoleon with the titles of Duke of Rivoli (&quot;duc de Rivoli&quot;) and Prince of Essling (&quot;prince d&#x27;Essling&quot;). However, his failed invasion of Portugal in 1810 earned him the disgrace of the Emperor, who no longer appointed him to any major commands during the Empire. Having rallied to the Bourbon Restoration, Masséna died in Paris shortly afterwards at the age of 58.

Although many of Napoleon&#x27;s generals were trained at the finest French and European military academies, Masséna was among those who achieved greatness without the benefit of formal education. While those of noble rank acquired their education and promotions as a matter of privilege, Masséna rose from humble origins to such prominence that Napoleon referred to him as &quot;the greatest name of my military empire&quot;. In addition to his battlefield successes, Masséna&#x27;s leadership aided the careers of many. A majority of the French marshals of the time served under his command at some point.

==Early life and career==
André Masséna was born on 6 May 1758 in Nice, in the County of Nice, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia, the son of Jules César Masséna (1731–1764) and Catherine Fabre. He was baptized Andrea Massena the same day at the Cathedral of Saint Reparata by Canon Ignazio Cacciardi. His father&#x27;s family, originally from Piedmont, had lived for at least three centuries in the Vésubie valley and owned land in Levens, a town in the hinterland of Nice. His father, after serving in the army for seven years, became a wine merchant on his return home in 1754. That same year he married Catherine Fabre, daughter of a contractor and shipowner from Toulon, with whom he had six children. He died from tuberculosis in 1764 and his widow, who quickly remarried, entrusted their children to the care of her first husband&#x27;s relatives; André, the eldest of three sons, was then six years old.

Masséna spent his childhood in the family home in Levens and revealed himself early on a turbulent boy. When he was not yet ten years old, his grandmother, anxious to compensate for his lack of education, tried to make him a baker, but Masséna did not appreciate this career any more than he did working in his uncle&#x27;s soap factory, where he remained until the age of 14. Giving up on becoming a craftsman, he preferred to run away and became a cabin boy aboard a merchant ship. He sailed in the Mediterranean Sea and on an extended voyage to French Guiana. In 1775, at the age of 17, Masséna definitively gave up sailing and, on the advice of his uncle Marcel, who was already serving in the unit as a non-commissioned officer, enlisted in the stationed in Toulon.

Benefiting from his good physical condition, Masséna learned the profession of arms while his uncle took care of his education. Appointed corporal on 1 September 1776, he was successively promoted to sergeant on 18 April 1777, to quartermaster on 14 February 1783, and finally to adjutant at the age of 26 on 4 September 1784. This was the highest rank a non-nobleman could achieve in the French Royal Army. On 13 April of the same year, Masséna was received as an apprentice in the Toulon masonic lodge &quot;Les Élèves de Minerve&quot;. His progression within the hierarchy of the lodge was rapid and he became its master of ceremonies on 15 August. On 27 September 1787, the Grand Orient de France created the lodge &quot;La Parfaite Amitié&quot; within the Royal Italian Regiment itself, of which Masséna became the president.

In 1788, following the restructuring of the Royal Italian, Masséna was sent to Antibes where he joined the corps of Royal Chasseurs of Provence. He stood out as a competent non-commissioned officer; with further advancement blocked, Masséna requested the following year to be transferred to the gendarmerie, but his request was rejected despite the recommendations of his commanding officer. He finally left his regiment on 3 August 1789, in the early days of the French Revolution, to settle in Antibes. There he married Marie Rosalie Lamare, daughter of a master surgeon, on 10 August. With little wealth, Masséna opened up a grocery store and, without much success, engaged in smuggling for about two years. During this time he became an active member of local revolutionary circles. With the establishment of the National Guard in French cities, Masséna was appointed instructor of the Antibes unit due to his military experience. He showed great efficiency in this post and was soon elected instructor captain of the 2nd volunteer battalion of Var on 14 September 1791. He became second lieutenant-colonel on 1 February 1792 and first lieutenant-colonel on 1 August.

==French Revolutionary Wars==

Masséna took part in the first Piedmontese campaign in the armies of the Republic. His battalion was assigned to the Army of the Var commanded by General Jacques Bernard d&#x27;Anselme, in a brigade that also included the 3rd Var Battalion, the 1st Hérault Battalion and a squadron of dragoons. Masséna quickly built a reputation as a leader who cared about discipline and the upkeep of his unit. General d&#x27;Anselme entered the city of Nice on 29 September 1792 at the head of the French troops occupying the County of Nice; shortly afterwards, Masséna&#x27;s battalion, integrated into General Brunet&#x27;s column, occupied the Principality of Monaco in October. The exactions committed by the French army angered the local population, and Masséna had to participate in the suppression of the &quot;barbet&quot; movement that resisted the French occupation of the County of Nice. As a native of the region and knowing it perfectly, he was particularly appreciated by his superiors, who also cited the good conduct of his battalion as an example.

On 8 June 1793, Masséna took part in an assault on the Col de Tende. Despite an initial success, he and his men came up against the defensive camp of Pérus, held by the Austro-Sardinians, and had to retreat in disorder. This setback did not hamper Masséna&#x27;s career, who had the support of the new commander-in-chief of the army, General Dumerbion, a friend of the family. He received command of the Fougasse camp, on the Col de Turini, and proceeded to execute an arrest warrant against General , whose management of the troops was called into question. On 17 August, he was named &quot;chef de brigade&quot; of the 51st Infantry Regiment, but Dumerbion refused to let him take up his assignment and Masséna therefore remained at the Fougasse camp; five days later, on 22 August, he learned of his promotion to general of brigade. He resisted Sardinian assaults on 7 and 12 September and then, after his transfer to the left wing of the Army of Italy, captured Utelle on 14 November. He soon afterwards requested leave to rest with his relatives at Antibes.

This interlude did not last long: on 14 December, Masséna was detached to the corps carrying out the Siege of Toulon under Dugommier&#x27;s order. From his arrival, replacing General La Poype at short notice, he personally led a column in an assault on Fort Lartigue, which he captured in the first charge. Masséna then turned the fort&#x27;s large-calibre cannons against the British fleet in the Toulon harbour, which, combined with the fall of Fort l&#x27;Éguillette - in which an officer named Napoleon Bonaparte distinguished himself - precipitated the withdrawal of the British squadron. As a reward for his services, Masséna was promoted to general of division on a provisional basis on 20 December 1793 and appointed governor of Toulon two days later.

Masséna then returned to the Army of Italy in January 1794 and obtained command of its right wing. In late March, in accordance with Dumerbion&#x27;s orders, he launched an offensive in the Genoa sector which took him as far as Garessio on 19 April and then to Colle Ardente, which he captured at the same time as the &quot;mille Fourches&quot; camp. In conjunction with General Macquard, commanding the central division, he seized the fort of Saorgio on 29 April and then the Col de Tende on 8 May, opening the way into Piedmont for the Army of Italy. According to Jean-Jacques Prévost, &quot;the execution of the campaign plan (initiated by Bonaparte) ensured by Masséna&#x27;s brilliant tactical mastery and the effective reorganization of the field artillery due to Bonaparte were the essential factors of this success&quot;. Masséna was confirmed in his rank of general of division on 29 August 1794. At the same time, judging his force to be stretched too thin, he decided to fall back with his men to Ormea for fear of an offensive return by the Austrians. On 21 September, he defeated with 18,000 soldiers the 8,000 Austrians of General Wallis at the Battle of Dego. Due to an illness, Masséna left his post on 22 December and his division was entrusted to General Sérurier.

Returning to the army in April 1795, Masséna was placed at the head of the 1st division of the right wing of the Army of Italy. The Italian front then saw little activity but, at the end of June, the Austro-Sardinians went on the offensive and forced the French to retreat to Borghetto, reconquering the ground lost the previous year. Driven out of Melogno on 25 June, Masséna retreated but still managed to maintain discipline among his troops. Following this setback, commander-in-chief Kellermann was replaced by Schérer, who decided, after consulting Masséna, to launch an offensive as winter approached. The main maneuver in the center was entrusted to Masséna, who commanded the Laharpe and Charlet divisions for the occasion, to which was added a reserve contingent. At the Battle of Loano on 23 November, he pushed back the enemy positions as far as Mount Settepani, not without suffering heavy losses, before falling back south towards Finale, on the Mediterranean coast. His forces thus bypassed Loano and the Austrian army of General Wallis positioned on the road to Finale, which finally retreated to Savona, abandoning a large part of its artillery and baggage to the French. Masséna&#x27;s decisive contribution to the victory earned him the congratulations of General Schérer, and representative on mission wrote to the authorities: &quot;Masséna has done wonders&quot;.

===Under Bonaparte&#x27;s orders in Italy===

Masséna, then aged 37 and with an already well-established reputation, seemed poised to succeed Schérer in the command of the Army of Italy. It was thus with skepticism that he received the appointment to this post of General Napoleon Bonaparte, ten years his junior, better known for his influential connections in Parisian circles than for his experience on the battlefield. Initially hostile to the newcomer, Masséna and the other divisional commanders were, however, very quickly won over by the Bonaparte&#x27;s determination, energy and sense of command. At the start of the campaign, in April 1796, Masséna had under his command the Laharpe (8,500 men) and Meynier (9,500 men) divisions.

After a meeting with Bonaparte on 10 April, during which the commander-in-chief informed him of his intentions, Masséna fought at the Battle of Montenotte where he launched a successful offensive on the Colle di Cadibona, cutting the Austro-Sardinian formation in two. He then pursued the Austrians retreating to Acqui. On 14 April, his troops captured the village of Dego after fierce combat and engaged in all sorts of excesses, in defiance of discipline. Indeed, when Vukassovich&#x27;s Austrian corps attacked the next day, it came as a total surprise: the French soldiers had to evacuate the village and Masséna himself, finding himself in bed with a mistress, had to flee in his nightshirt. The general nevertheless managed to regroup his forces and to retake Dego at the end of the day, though not without suffering significant losses. The French troops soon won a series of victories that led the Kingdom of Sardinia to request an armistice, while the Austrians retreated hastily across Northern Italy.

Having crossed the Po at Piacenza, Bonaparte caught up with the Austrian rearguard at Lodi, on the banks of the river Adda. At the Battle of Lodi, the bridge separating the two banks was taken at a rapid pace by an infantry column led by Masséna and a handful of generals (Dallemagne, Lannes, Berthier and Cervoni). The Austrians, shaken by this vigorous action and the deployment of the French cavalry, abandoned the field. Masséna was awarded a sabre of honour for his conduct during this battle. Bonaparte entered Milan on 16 May. Despite the enthusiastic reception of the population, he demanded the payment of a contribution of 20 million gold pounds and allowed his troops to engage in looting, which led a week later to anti-French revolts in Binasco and Pavia. On 21 May, the commander-in-chief decided to resume his advance and the vanguard commanded by Masséna reached Brescia on 27 May and then Verona on 1 June. In this phase of the campaign, marked by numerous attempts by the Austrians to lift the Siege of Mantua, Masséna was constantly on the front line, which earned him the esteem of Bonaparte, who said of him on 14 August: &quot;active, tireless, has audacity, &quot;coup d&#x27;œil&quot; and promptitude in making decisions&quot;.

At the moment when Bonaparte prepared to confront Wurmser&#x27;s imperial army, Masséna&#x27;s division had 12,000 soldiers. Faced with an Austrian thrust from the north, Masséna retreated to Castelnuovo and then headed towards Lonato, where his division took part, on 3 August, in the battle that resulted in the defeat of Quasdanovich&#x27;s Austrian corps. Two days later he commanded the left wing of the French army at the Battle of Castiglione, fought by Bonaparte against Wurmser. Early in the day, his troops feigned a retreat, leading Wurmser to rush into this &quot;gap&quot; in order to link up with Quasdanovich, who was now far away. However, a premature attack by Sérurier&#x27;s division on his rear caused him to interrupt his movement; Bonaparte then unleashed a general attack and launched Masséna and Augereau against the Austrian center, while the positions of the Imperials on both of their wings were taken, leading to Wurmser&#x27;s retreat.

A month later, Wurmser returned to the offensive in order to relieve the fortress of Mantua, still besieged by the French. Bonaparte immediately sent his forces to intercept him: the Masséna division defeated the Austrian general Davidovich at the Battle of Rovereto on 4 September, occupied Trento on the 5th and set off after Wurmser, who tried by all possible means to reach Mantua. At the Battle of Bassano on 8 September, the Imperial rearguard was cut to pieces by the Masséna and Augereau divisions, which did not prevent Wurmser from reaching Mantua on 15 September. At this point, Masséna&#x27;s division numbered no more than 5,300 men, compared to around 10,000 at the beginning of the month. Shortly afterwards, a powerful Austrian army commanded by General Alvinczi arrived in the Italian theatre: Masséna, greatly outnumbered, suffered the enemy offensive and retreated successively to Vicenza and then Verona, before attempting a counter-offensive against Alvinczi that was defeated at Caldiero on 12 November. Modifying his strategy, Bonaparte decided to strike the Austrian rear at the Battle of Arcole. On 15 November, Masséna captured the town of Porcile, covering Augereau&#x27;s manoeuvre which was directed towards Arcole. However, despite the determination of their soldiers, the French were unable to hold on to the Alpone and retreated to the Adige. On 17 November, however, the clashes resumed and this time turned to the advantage of the Army of Italy: Masséna recaptured Ronco and Arcole which, combined with the pressure from Augereau&#x27;s troops, forced Alvinczi to retreat.

Masséna&#x27;s division was then put into winter quarters in Verona, but indiscipline soon set in among the soldiers who threatened to rebel against their commanders. Alvinczi&#x27;s resumption of the campaign in January 1797 nevertheless brought operations back to the forefront. On 13 January, Masséna, whose troops amounted to around 10,000 men, received the order to reinforce General Joubert, who was facing the bulk of the Austrian army at Rivoli, but only arrived there the following day after marching all night. With a bayonet charge, his division destroyed General Lusignan&#x27;s Austrian column and helped to secure the French victory at the Battle of Rivoli. As soon as the battle was over, Masséna and his troops headed south to intercept a second Austrian army advancing to relieve Mantua. On 15 January, at the Villa La Favorita in front of Mantua, he encircled and defeated Provera&#x27;s column. For his successes and talents as a tactician, Masséna was described in front of the troops by Bonaparte as &quot;the dear child of victory&quot; (&quot;l&#x27;enfant chéri de la victoire&quot;). The president of the Directory in Paris, Jean-François Rewbell, was also congratulatory: &quot;The Executive Directory congratulates you, citizen general, for the new success that you have obtained against the enemies of the Republic. The brave division that you command has covered itself with glory in the three consecutive days that forced Mantua to capitulate, and the Directory is obliged to regard you among the most capable and useful generals of the Republic.&quot; In 1808, in memory of Masséna&#x27;s conduct during this battle, Bonaparte would award him the victory title of Duke of Rivoli. His soldiers had indeed shown remarkable endurance on this occasion, as the historian Stéphane Béraud attests:

The Habsburg monarchy, alarmed by the French victories in Italy, dispatched to the front its best general, Archduke Charles, to redress the situation. For his part, Bonaparte, who now disposed of significant troops thanks to reinforcements detached from the Army of the Rhine, went on the offensive: Masséna, with 10,000 men, was placed on the French left. His mission was to turn the Archduke&#x27;s troops as soon as the opportunity presented itself. On 14 March, he defeated Lusignan&#x27;s corps and prevented the Austrian armies of Tyrol and Friuli from joining up. A few days later, on 22 and 23 March, he seized the Tarvis pass at the Battle of Tarvis, capturing 3,500 Austrians and 25 cannons; on the 30th, he entered Klagenfurt with the commander-in-chief and the Chabot and Guieu divisions. He continued to pursue the imperial forces and occupied Leoben on 7 April, being informed the same day of the signing of the Armistice of Leoben. The advanced elements of his division, positioned at Bruck, were then less than 160 km from Vienna.

===Trip to Paris and return to Italy===
Masséna returned to France on 6 May, accompanied by his aide-de-camp . Historians debate the reasons for his departure: according to Georges Six, his mission was to present to the Directory the documents relating to the preliminaries of Leoben, while Prévost proposes a presentation of enemy standards captured during the last campaign. Frédéric Hulot instead suggests the potential delivery of &quot;confidential letter for Barras&quot;, as well as a &quot;political information mission&quot;. Upon his arrival, Masséna met with the leading directors and was officially received by the authorities at the Luxembourg Palace on 9 May. At the end of the ceremony, he was presented with a sabre of honour. Masséna also approached directors Barras and La Révellière-Lépeaux, who encouraged him to run for a seat in the Directory that May, though in the end a royalist was elected. Disappointed by this failure, Masséna returned to Italy on 12 July with the ratification of the peace accords in his possession. After a stopover at Bonaparte&#x27;s residence in Mombello, near Milan, he set up his headquarters in Padua.

After the signing of the Treaty of Campo Formio, which brought an end to hostilities, Masséna continued to serve with the troops stationed on the Italian peninsula. The French occupation forces, under the command of General Louis-Alexandre Berthier, invaded the last independent Italian states, in accordance with the Directory&#x27;s instructions: Masséna was notably involved in the somewhat confused organization of the Roman Republic following the entry of French troops into Rome on 11 February 1798. Pope Pius VI was transferred to Siena and the local republican administration was flanked by a French civil commission charged with monitoring its every move. General Berthier, unhappy with the role assigned to him, ended up handing over command of the French forces in Rome to Masséna.

Very quickly, the territory of the new sister republic was thoroughly pillaged by the occupation troops, with several generals taking part in this ravaging. This behavior was severely condemned by the junior officers and their protests increased after the appointment of Masséna, whose reputation for greed and embezzlement was well known within the army. The French troops stationed in Rome, largely composed of contingents from the Army of the Rhine detached to Italy under Bernadotte&#x27;s orders, were particularly hostile to Masséna. The presence of these units created a climate of tension, and physical altercations took place with soldiers of the Masséna division. The situation degenerated into a mutiny and the authorities, including the civil commissioners, were unable to restore order. Masséna was then recalled and replaced in Rome by General Gouvion Saint-Cyr. He returned to Antibes where he remained without assignment for several months, not having been chosen to participate in the Egyptian campaign.

===Decisive victory at Zurich and Siege of Genoa===
With the formation of the Second Coalition against France in 1798, Masséna was detached as a divisional commander to the Army of Mayence in August before taking command of the Army of Helvetia on 9 December. He found himself in a difficult situation facing the Austro-Russian armies led by Archduke Charles and General Korsakov. During this long and difficult campaign, Masséna, in addition to his usual vigour, courage and tenacity, demonstrated great strategic acumen. At the head of around 30,000 men, he first took the initiative in the Grisons before falling back on Zurich in the face of Austrian numerical superiority. He was driven out of the city by Charles at the First Battle of Zurich over 4–6 June. After the Austrian night attack over 4–5 June, both sides rested on 5 June, but when the Austrians resumed their attack on 6 June, Masséna had abandoned the city and taken up positions in the surrounding mountains. He then entrenched himself behind the Limmat and repelled a new attack in August. Becoming aware of the advance of Russian field marshal Alexander Suvorov toward St. Gotthard in September, Masséna had used his troops in the south of Switzerland: General Lecourbe&#x27;s French division took the Gotthard Pass, which required Suvorov to retake it on 24 September, delaying his advance north towards Zurich. Suvorov then faced General Soult&#x27;s division blocking the route at Altdorf and then took the Teufelsbrücke in the Schöllenen Gorge. The same day, 25 September, Masséna defeated the Austro-Russians under Korsakov at the Second Battle of Zurich, arguably the greatest French victory of 1799.

Following this success, Masséna organized a series of combined movements to encircle the second Russian army under Suvorov. Unable to break through the French lines and aware of Korsakov&#x27;s disastrous defeat, Suvorov turned east through the high and difficult Pragel Pass to Glarus. Despite defeats at the simultaneous battles of Klöntal and Muottental, the operation conceived by Masséna was a success: the Russian troops, badly battered, only escaped destruction by carrying out an exhausting retreat east into the 9,000-foot high mountains of the Panikh range. After a difficult march, the Russian army reached Ilanz on 8 October and then crossed the treacherous Panix Pass, abandoning its baggage and all of its artillery. The victory at Zurich, considered Masséna&#x27;s finest feat of arms, had a decisive influence on the course of the war: through this strategic success, Masséna saved France from a planned invasion and led Tsar Paul I of Russia to withdraw from the Coalition shortly afterwards. Donald D. Howard writes:

After Bonaparte came to power in France through the coup d&#x27;état of 18 Brumaire, Masséna took command of the remaining French forces in Italy. These troops, defeated in several encounters, had established themselves on the Ligurian Apennines. Attacked by General Michael von Melas&#x27;s Austrian army, Masséna had to withdraw to Genoa where he was besieged, while Bonaparte marched with the Army of the Reserve to Milan. By the end of May, plague had spread throughout Genoa and the civilian population was in revolt. Negotiations were begun for the exchange of prisoners early in June, but the citizens and some of the garrison clamored for capitulation. Unknown to Masséna, the Austrian general Peter Ott had been ordered to raise the siege because Bonaparte had crossed Great St. Bernard Pass and was now threatening the main Austrian army. Describing the situation at Genoa, Ott requested and received permission to continue the siege. On 4 June, with one day&#x27;s rations remaining, Masséna&#x27;s negotiator finally agreed to evacuate the French Army from Genoa. However, &quot;if the word capitulation was mentioned or written&quot;, Masséna threatened to end all negotiations. Two days later, a few of the French left the city by sea, but the bulk of Masséna&#x27;s starving and exhausted troops marched out of the city with all their equipment and followed the road along the coast toward France, ending the siege of almost 60 days. The siege was an astonishing demonstration of tenacity, ingenuity, courage, and daring that garnered additional laurels for Masséna and placed him in a category previously reserved for Bonaparte alone.

By forcing the Austrians to deploy vast forces against him at Genoa, Masséna made it possible for Bonaparte to cross the Great St. Bernard Pass, surprise the Austrians, and ultimately defeat Melas&#x27; Austrian army at Marengo before sufficient reinforcements could be transferred from the siege site. Less than three weeks after the evacuation, Bonaparte wrote to Masséna, &quot;I am not able to give you a greater mark of the confidence I have in you than by giving you command of the first army of the Republic [Army of Italy].&quot; Even the Austrians recognized the significance of Masséna&#x27;s defense; the Austrian chief of staff declared firmly, &quot;You won the battle, not in front of Alessandria but in front of Genoa.&quot; Despite the praise, Bonaparte also criticized Masséna for capitulating too early in his memoirs, contrasting his actions with those of the Gauls under Vercingetorix when besieged by Julius Caesar in the Battle of Alesia.

Masséna was appointed commander of the Army of Italy by Bonaparte when the latter returned to Paris on 24 June 1800. However, the poor financial situation of the army and allegations of corruption weighing on him and his staff led to his recall in August. He then saw himself exonerated from all command and retired to Antibes with his family, before settling in 1801 at the Château de Rueil, in the &quot;banlieue&quot; of Paris.

==Napoleonic Wars==

Having retired to the countryside, Masséna nevertheless continued to manifest his opposition to the political choices of Bonaparte, for whom he had no particular sympathy; he openly criticized the Concordat of 1801 and, elected the following year as a deputy to the &quot;Corps législatif&quot;, voted against making Bonaparte consul for life. Georges Six indicates, however, that Masséna only sat in the legislature from 28 July 1803 until 31 December 1807. Despite his strained relations with the head of state, Masséna received the baton of Marshal of the Empire on 19 May 1804, the day after the proclamation of the imperial regime. From his accession to the marshalate, Masséna ceased to appear as a political opponent. Also in 1804, he participated in the reorganization of French Freemasonry and became, in November, &quot;grand representative of the Grand Master of the Supreme Council&quot;; in this capacity, he was one of the negotiators of the concordat established between the Grand Orient of France and the Supreme Council. Under the Empire, he was a member of &quot;Sainte Caroline&quot;, a highly selective Parisian lodge particularly sought after for its worldliness. He was also &quot;honorary venerable&quot; in various Masonic workshops, such as &quot;Les Frères réunis&quot; in Paris, &quot;La Parfaite Amitié&quot; in Toulon, &quot;L&#x27;Étroite Union&quot; in Thouars and &quot;Les Vrais Amis réunis&quot; in Nice.

On the outbreak of the War of the Third Coalition in 1805, Napoleon entrusted Masséna with command of the Army of Italy. The marshal, who spoke fluent Italian, had in fact a great deal of experience in this theatre of operations. His mission consisted of pinning down Archduke Charles&#x27; Austrian troops in this area while awaiting developments of the situation in Germany, where the Emperor himself was heading at the head of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;. After increasing his fighting strength to around 50,000 men, the marshal went on the offensive on 18 October and achieved an initial success by forcing the crossing of the Adige at the Battle of Verona. On 30 October, he fought the Archduke at the Battle of Caldiero, the outcome of which was generally favourable to the French, despite the determined resistance of the Austrian troops. He then set off in pursuit of his adverseries, who were retreating towards Ljubljana, while the Austrian capitulation at Ulm opened the road to Vienna for Napoleon. Masséna continued his advance and successively broke through the enemy&#x27;s defensive lines on the Brenta, the Piave, the Tagliamento and the Isonzo, seeking, in accordance with the Emperor&#x27;s orders, to prevent the Austrian armies from linking up.

With the end of the war following Napoleon&#x27;s decisive victory at Austerlitz, Masséna remained in Italy. He received the task of conquering the Kingdom of Naples on 27 December 1805. The aim of this campaign was to dethrone the Bourbon dynasty in favor of a new French satellite kingdom led by Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon&#x27;s elder brother. The French invasion of Naples initially unfolded without great difficulty: King Ferdinand IV fled to Sicily and the fortress of Gaeta capitulated in July 1806 after a siege of almost five months. In reality, the situation was far from being stabilised due to the insurrection of pro-Bourbon partisans in the Basilicata and Calabria regions, with those in the latter benefiting from the support of a British expeditionary corps. The conflict quickly acquired a fierce and merciless dimension, leading both sides to commit numerous exactions against the civilian population. Masséna harshly supressed the revolts, devastated occupied territories and adopted draconian measures which sometimes resulted in mass executions; the insurgent leader Fra Diavolo was hanged and the town of Lauria was completely ravaged in a committed by French troops.

Despite these brutal methods, the Napoleonic army struggled to contain the insurrection. Masséna had to detach part of his forces to Calabria under the command of General Reynier, which did not prevent the British from holding on to the tip of the Italian peninsula until 1808. Meanwhile, the marshal seized the property of the vanquished in southern Italy and even authorized himself to issue import licenses, in total contradiction with the Continental Blockade policy applied against British shipping. On bad terms with King Joseph and opposed to a planned landing in Sicily, Masséna resigned on 15 December 1806 and returned to France at the beginning of the following year. In late February he was called to command the V Corps, stationed in Poland, which constituted the right wing of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;. Charged with covering Warsaw and keeping General Essen&#x27;s Russian corps in place, Masséna&#x27;s troops did not play a very active part in the 1807 campaign which resulted in the defeat of Russia and Prussia.

Masséna, disappointed at having been relegated to a secondary post, also struggled with the harsh Polish cold. Suffering from a serious lung disease, he was granted leave and returned to France in July. He then devoted himself to managing his fortune and acquired that same year the Hôtel de Bentheim, located in the Faubourg Saint-Germain of Paris. As a reward for his services, Masséna was made Duke of Rivoli (&quot;duc de Rivoli&quot;) on 19 March 1808. In September, he nearly lost an eye when Napoleon accidentally fired a rifle at him while hunting near Paris, although Masséna diplomatically preferred to attribute responsibility to Berthier.

===Fifth Coalition===

Masséna regained operational command during the war against Austria in 1809. Napoleon entrusted him with the IV Corps, a unit composed mostly of conscripts. The marshal made his way through Bavaria but, despite his and Napoleon&#x27;s efforts, he had little involvement in the first phase of the campaign. During the battles of Landshut and Eckmühl, Masséna&#x27;s corps, which advanced by forced marches under the energetic leadership of its commander, did not arrive in time to complete the encirclement of the Austrians, who managed to retreat north of Ratisbonne.

After participating in the march on Vienna, Masséna fought the bloody Battle of Ebersberg on 3 May against the Austrian rearguard, where he was criticized by the Emperor for having prematurely ordered a frontal attack on the enemy positions. He also played a leading role at the Battle of Aspern-Essling. Masséna led the first crossing of the Danube in front of Vienna and repelled Austrian attacks on the village of Aspern; during the fighting, the marshal rallied his men by fighting among them as a rifleman. The collapse of the bridges however rendered the situation extremely perilous for the French troops on the north bank. Following the mortal wounding of Marshal Lannes and Napoleon&#x27;s decision to suspend the offensive, Masséna took command of the bridgehead and skillfully organized a retreat to the island of Lobau, in the middle of the Danube. In the weeks following this setback, Masséna worked closely with the Emperor to consolidate the French positions on the island and prepare a new crossing of the river, further downstream.

A second offensive was planned for July 1809. A few days before the start of operations, Masséna fell from his horse which had stepped into a rabbit hole and was seriously injured in the leg. He refused, however, to return to Vienna for treatment and continued to command the IV Corps from a carriage. On 5 July, the first day of the Battle of Wagram, Masséna&#x27;s troops drove Klenau&#x27;s Austrian corps out of Aspern. The next day, when Bernadotte&#x27;s Saxon units had just lost the village of Aderklaa, Masséna came to support him with two divisions and fought a ferocious battle for possession of the town. During the action, his carriage was targeted by enemy cavalrymen. With a pistol, he shot a hussar who was threatening him in the head. On his left, the Boudet division was pushed out of Aspern and Essling by the Austrians. Faced with the gravity of the situation, Napoleon personnaly went to Masséna and climbed into the carriage alongside the marshal; from this improvised headquarters exposed to enemy fire, the Emperor informed Masséna of his intention to break the Austrian line through the center and ordered him to retake Essling. The marshal ultimately succeeded in stopping the enemy advance, stabilizing the situation in the Essling sector, while the retreat initiated by Archduke Charles gave victory to Napoleon.

The next day, Masséna&#x27;s IV Corps set off in pursuit of the Austrian army, which it seriously engaged on 11 July at the Battle of Znaim. An armistice signed on the 12th, however, brought an end to the fighting and Masséna, after reorganizing his troops in Moravia, returned to France in early November 1809. On 14 October 1809, Napoleon rewarded Masséna with a second, now princely, victory title, Prince of Essling (&quot;prince d&#x27;Essling&quot;), in recognition of his role during the campaign and his brilliant performance at Essling in particular.

===Portuguese campaign===

On 17 April 1810, Napoleon designated Masséna to unblock the situation of the Peninsular War and entrusted him with the mission of reconquering Portugal, thus constituting the third French invasion of this country, after failed attempts by Junot (who had initially managed to occupy the country) in 1808 and Soult in 1809. The Marshal was given command of the , composed of Ney&#x27;s VI Corps, Reynier&#x27;s II Corps and Junot&#x27;s VIII Corps, theoretically constituting a considerable force of over 130,000 men. Masséna, who had openly expressed to the Emperor his lack of enthusiasm for this assignement and the difficult task ahead, set to work with his usual vigour. However, the Prince of Essling seemed physically and morally diminished; In addition, the presence in the army of his mistress at the time, Eugénie Renique, disguised as an officer, caused a scandal. Faced with the lack of cooperation from his subordinates, supply issues and the instability of the lines of communication in an area devoid of resources and infested by guerrillas, the marshal could only gather about 60,000 men for the invasion of Portugal, where he was preparing to face the Anglo-Portuguese troops of General Wellington.

After waiting until the harvest period to allow his troops to resupply, Masséna succeeded in seizing Ciudad Rodrigo on 10 July and then Almeida on 27 August, before entering Portugal in September. Faced with his opponent&#x27;s advance, Wellington quickly retreated towards Lisbon, making sure to destroy the crops before the French arrived. The British general finally established himself in front of Coimbra with the intention of halting Masséna and, entrenched on a height, repelled the marshal&#x27;s assaults at the Battle of Bussaco on 27 September 1810. Masséna, noting the futility of attacking the solid British infantry head-on, organized a manoeuvre which allowed him to outflank the enemy defences and resume his march towards Lisbon, while Wellington managed to retreat with his army intact.

At the head of a smaller army than before and weakened by food shortage, Masséna continued his advance and arrived near Lisbon, but on the way came up against the lines of Torres Vedras which Wellington had erected to protect access to the Portuguese capital. While the Allied troops were supplied by sea and thus had sufficient resources to sustain a siege, the situation of the French army, stuck in front of the fortifications and in the grip of a logistical crisis, became increasingly precarious. After having uselessly idled in front of the lines for over a month, Masséna, considering his situation hopeless and having been refused the artillery park requested from Joseph Bonaparte (then King of Spain), decided to abandon the siege on 14 November and retreated to Santarém, where he remained until 6 March 1811 in difficult conditions. His army then withdrew to Almeida before heading towards Salamanca where it arrived on 10 April.

In the meantime, Masséna had a violent argument with Ney, who, despite his brilliant performance during the campaign, had not appreciated serving under the Prince of Essling&#x27;s orders; infuriated, Masséna relieved Ney of his command and sent him back to France. Timidly pursued by Wellington, Masséna decided to resume the offensive in order to relieve blockaded Almeida and engaged the Anglo-Portuguese army at the Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro on 3 May 1811. During this confrontation that lasted three days, Masséna succeeded in exploiting a weakness in Wellington&#x27;s line, but the inaction of General Lepic&#x27;s cavalry and the attitude of Marshal Bessières, who refused to support him, finally forced him to withdraw. 

Napoleon, deeply disappointed by the failure of the invasion of Portugal, openly expressed his discontent to Masséna, who finally had to hand over his command to Marshal Marmont on 11 May 1811. Back in France, he was poorly received by the Emperor, who declared to him: &quot;So, Prince of Essling, you are no longer Masséna?&quot; Masséna&#x27;s defeat in Portugal, partly due to his mistakes but also to practical difficulties and poor cooperation from his lieutenants, brought an end to his career on the battlefield.

==Later life==
Retiring to his château in Rueil with his family, Masséna rarely appeared at court and began writing his memoirs while taking care of his children&#x27;s education. He was not employed in the Russian campaign in 1812. In July of the same year, the situation in Spain deteriorated sharply with Marmont&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Salamanca. Cambacérès, who presided the regency council in the Emperor&#x27;s absence, decided to send Masséna back to the Iberian Peninsula with the title of general-in-chief. The marshal accepted the post, but, weakened by a high fever while in Bayonne, he asked to be relieved of his command at the end of August. He then spent some time in his native Nice before returning to his estate in Rueil a few months later. On 16 April 1813, the Emperor appointed him commander of the 8th military division, based in Toulon. In this capacity, Masséna foiled a royalist conspiracy to hand over the port of Toulon to the British and to provoke an insurrection in Provence, a plot whose main leaders were tried and executed in December 1813; he also had to deal with attempted incursions by the British Mediterranean Fleet and track down conscription evaders.

After Napoleon&#x27;s abdication in April 1814, Masséna was kept in his functions by Louis XVIII who made him a Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Louis. On 20 January 1815, the king also granted him naturalization, since Nice had been returned to Sardinia under the Treaty of Paris. Masséna was elevated to the peerage soon afterwards. He remained loyal to the Bourbons well into in 1815, not accepting any service during the Hundred Days, though he later attended the Champ de Mai ceremony and sat in the Chamber of Peers. During the session of 22 June, when General La Bédoyère argued in favour of the rights of the King of Rome to the crown, Masséna exclaimed: &quot;young man, you forget yourself!&quot; With Napoleon&#x27;s definitive abdication the same day, the Prince of Essling was appointed commander of the National Guard of Paris by the Provisional Government and participated in this capacity in a war council at La Villette, which saw the marshals and generals charged with the defense of Paris opt to surrender the capital. After serving briefly as military governor of Paris, he was placed back at the head of the 8th military division by the Second Restoration. Masséna was one of the four marshals present at Ney&#x27;s court martial and, along with the majority of his comrades, declared himself incompetent, deferring judgment to the Chamber of Peers. Denounced to the Chambers as not having opposed Napoleon&#x27;s return, he was dismissed from his duties and had to defend himself from accusations of bribery brought against him by the ultra-royalists. Masséna died of tuberculosis on 4 April 1817 in Paris, aged 58. His funeral was held on 6 April at the Père-Lachaise Cemetery, with an eulogy delivered General Thiébault.

==Writings==
Masséna authored a work titled &quot;Mémoire de M. le Maréchal Masséna, sur les événements qui ont eu lieu en Provence, pendant les mois de mars et d&#x27;avril 1815&quot;, published in 1816. His memoirs (&quot;Mémoires de Massena&quot;), published between 1849 and 1850, were in fact written by General Jean-Baptiste-Frédéric Koch. They were reissued between 1966 and 1967.

==Marriage and issue==

On 10 August 1789, Masséna married Anne Marie Rosalie Lamare (1765–1829), the daughter of a master surgeon from Antibes. They had four children:

*Marie Anne Élisabeth Masséna (8 July 1790 – 18 March 1794).
*Jacques Prosper Masséna (Antibes, 25 June 1793 – 13 May 1821), 2nd prince d&#x27;Essling from 3 July 1818.
*Victoire Thècle Masséna (Antibes, 28 September 1794 – 18 March 1857), who married General Honoré Charles Reille, a former aide-de-camp of Masséna and Napoleon, on 12 September 1814. They had four children, including René Reille (1835–1898), who married (1844–1910), daughter of and granddaughter of Marshal Soult. Another son, (1818–1895), married his first cousin Françoise Anne Masséna (1824–1902), daughter of François Victor Masséna (1799–1863).
*François Victor Masséna (1799–1863) (Antibes, 2 April 1799 – 16 April 1863), who succeeded his father as 2nd duc de Rivoli and his brother as 3rd prince d&#x27;Essling. He married Anne Debelle, daughter of General Jean-François Joseph Debelle, on 19 April 1823.

==Legacy==

Masséna is the namesake of one of the Boulevards of the Marshals that circle Paris, having also a bridge named after him. The village of Massena in New York was settled by French lumbermen in the early 19th century and named in Masséna&#x27;s honor. Massena, Iowa, also in the United States and in turn named for the community in New York, honors Masséna with a portrait of him in Centennial Park. His birthplace, Nice, is the location of Place Masséna, also named after him. The palatial Museé Masséna in Nice houses memorabilia of Masséna&#x27;s life but was constructed by his grandson and is named for him.

Masséna had a French battleship named after him. The ship was built as part of the 1890 French naval construction program. It was the fourth of five ships, and was designed by naval architect Louis de Bussy. It did not see major combat, and its final service was as a breakwater in the Gallipoli campaign in 1915.

==In literature==
* Masséna is mentioned and/or appears in several of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Brigadier Gerard stories, including &quot;How the Brigadier Saved the Army&quot; (1902).
* Masséna appears as a minor character in Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s novels &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Escape&quot;, detailing France&#x27;s failed attempt to re-invade Portugal in 1810, including the Battle of Bussaco, and &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Battle&quot;, detailing the Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro.

==Honours==
*: Grand Eagle of the Legion of Honour.
*: Grand Dignitary of Order of the Iron Crown.
*: Knight of the Order of Saint Hubert.
*: Grand Cordon of the Order of Fidelity.
*: Commander of the Order of Saint Louis.

<text>A paddle is a handheld tool with an elongated handle and a flat, widened end (the &quot;blade&quot;) used as a lever to apply force onto the bladed end. It most commonly describes a completely handheld tool used to propel a human-powered watercraft by pushing water in a direction opposite to the direction of travel (i.e. paddling). A paddle is different from an oar (which can be similar in shape and perform the same function via rowing) – an oar is attached to the watercraft via a fulcrum.

The term &quot;paddle&quot; can also be used to describe objects of similar shapes or functions:
*A rotating set of paddle boards known as a paddle wheel is used to propel a steamboat or paddle steamer.
*In a number of racquet sports (e.g. ping-pong and paddle ball), a &quot;paddle&quot; or &quot;bat&quot; is a short, solid racket used to strike a ball.
*A mixing paddle is a device used to stir or mix separate ingredients within a mixture.
*A spanking paddle is used in corporal punishment, typically to forcefully hit someone (e.g. a juvenile) on the buttocks.

==Canoe and kayak paddles==
===Materials and designs===

Paddles commonly used in canoes consist of a wooden, fibreglass, carbon fibre, or metal rod (the &quot;shaft&quot;) with a handle on one end and a rigid sheet (the &quot;blade&quot;) on the other end. Paddles for use in kayaks are longer, with a blade on each end; they are handled from the middle of the shaft.

Kayak paddles having blades in the same plane (when viewed down the shaft) are called &quot;un-feathered.&quot; Paddles with blades in different planes are called &quot;feathered&quot;. Feathered paddles are measured by the degree of feather, such as 30, 45, or even 90 degrees. Many modern paddles are made of two pieces which can be snapped together in either feathered or unfeathered settings. The shaft is normally straight but in some cases a &#x27;crank&#x27; is added with the aim of making the paddle more comfortable and reducing strain on the wrist. Because the kayak paddle is not supported by the boat, paddles made of lighter materials are desired; it is not uncommon for a kayak paddle to be two pounds ( ) or less and very expensive paddles can be as light as . Weight savings are more desirable at the ends of the paddle rather than in the middle.

Cheaper kayak paddles have an aluminium shaft while more expensive ones use a lighter fibreglass or carbon fibre shaft. Some paddles have a smaller diameter shaft for people with smaller hands. Paddle length varies with a longer paddle being better suited for stronger people, taller people, and people using the paddle in a wider kayak. Some paddle makers have an online paddle size calculator. Blades vary in size and shape. A blade with a larger surface area may be desirable for a strong person with good shoulder joints, but tiring for a weaker person or a person with less than perfect shoulder joints. 

Because normal paddling involves alternately dipping and raising the paddle blades, the colour of the blades may affect the visibility of the kayaker to powerboats operators under limited visibility conditions. For this reason white or yellow blades may offer a safety advantage over black or blue blades. Of course, kayakers should wear a headlamp or have other lighting on their kayak under conditions of limited lighting. However, if a powerboat operator must look straight into a sun low in the sky to see a kayaker, the motion of brightly coloured paddle blades may be of more value than lighting on the kayak. Highly reflective water resistant tape (e.g. SOLAS tape) may be affixed to the paddle blades and boat to enhance visibility.

===Use===
The paddle is held with two hands, some distance apart from each other. For normal use, it is drawn through the water from front (bow) to back (stern) to drive the boat forwards. The two blades of a kayak paddle are dipped alternately on either side of the kayak. A paddle is distinguished from an oar in that the paddle is held in the user&#x27;s hands and completely supported by the paddler, whereas an oar is primarily supported by the boat, through the use of oarlocks. Gloves may be worn to prevent blistering for long periods of paddling.

==Other types==
On mechanical paddle steamers, the motorized paddling is not done with a mass of paddles or oars but by rotating one or a few paddle wheels (rather the inverse of a water mill).

Racing paddles also have special designs. They are generally less flat and are curved to catch more water, which enable racing paddlers to maximize the efficiency of their stroke. Wing bladed paddles are very popular in kayak racing. A wing paddle looks like a spoon and acts like a wing or sail, generating lift on the convex side, which pulls the paddle forward-outward at the expense of overcoming drag. This gives additional forward thrust as compared with a flat paddle with forward thrust mainly from drag. Bent shaft paddles, popular with tripping and marathon canoers, have a blade that is angled from the shaft, usually 12 to 15 degrees.

<doc id="158650" wikidata="Q34173" url="?curid=158650" title="Luba-Kasai language">
<text>Luba-Kasai, also known as Cilubà or Tshilubà, Luba-Lulua, is a Bantu language (Zone L) of Central Africa and a national language of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, alongside Lingala, Swahili, and Kikongo ya leta.

An eastern dialect is spoken by the Luba people of the East Kasai Region and a western dialect by the Lulua people of the West Kasai Region. The total number of speakers was estimated at 6.3 million in 1991.

Within the Zone L Bantu languages, Luba-Kasai is one of a group of languages which form the &quot;Luba&quot; group, together with Kaonde (L40), Kete (L20), Kanyok, Luba-Katanga (KiLuba), Sanga, Zela and Bangubangu.
The L20, L30 and L60 languages are also grouped as the Luban languages within Zone L Bantu.

== Geographic distribution and dialects ==
Tshiluba is chiefly spoken in a large area in the Kasaï Occidental and Kasaï Oriental provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, the differences in Tshiluba within the area are minor, consisting mostly of differences in tones and vocabulary, and speakers easily understand one another. Both dialects have subdialects. 
Additionally, there is also a pidginised variety of Tshiluba, especially in cities, where the everyday spoken Tshiluba is enriched with French words and even words from other languages, such as Lingala or Swahili. Nevertheless, it is not a typical form of a pidgin since it is not common to everyone but changes its morphology and the quantity and degree to which words from other languages are used. Its form changes depending on who speaks it and varies from city to city and social class to social class. However, people generally speak the regular Tshiluba language in their daily lives, rather than pidgin.

The failure of the language to be taught at school has resulted in the replacement of native words by French words for the most part. For instance, people speaking generally count in French, rather than Tshiluba. The situation of French and Tshiluba being used simultaneously made linguists mistakenly think that the language had been pidginised.

==Vocabulary==

==Alphabet==
Luba-Kasai uses the Latin alphabet, with the digraphs &quot;ng&quot;, &quot;ny&quot; and &quot;sh&quot; but without the letters &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot; and &quot;x&quot;:

==Phonology==
Tshiluba has a 5 vowel system with vowel length:

The chart shows the consonants of Tshiluba.
* /p/ may also have the sound [ɸ].
* If a /d/ is preceding an /i/, it may also be pronounced as an affricate sound [dʒ].

==Sample text==
According to The Rosetta Project, Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights translates to: 
:&quot;Bantu bonsu badi baledibwa badikadile ne badi ne makokeshi amwe. Badi ne lungenyi lwa bumuntu ne kondo ka moyo, badi ne bwa kwenzelangana malu mu buwetu.&quot;
:&quot;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&quot;

According to Learn Tshiluba (Mofeko): 
:&quot;Mukayi wuani udi mu bujimi&quot;
:&quot;My wife is on the farm&quot;

:&quot;Mulunda wanyi mujikija kalasa Uenda mu tshidimu tshishala&quot;
:&quot;My friend completed his/her studies last year&quot;

<text>The Riksdag (, ; also or &quot;Sveriges riksdag&quot; ) is the parliament and the supreme decision-making body of the Kingdom of Sweden. Since 1971, the Riksdag has been a unicameral parliament with 349 members (), elected proportionally and serving, since 1994, fixed four-year terms. The 2022 Swedish general election is the most recent general election.

The constitutional mandates of the Riksdag are enumerated in the &quot;Instrument of Government&quot; (), and its internal workings are specified in greater detail in the Riksdag Act (). The seat of the Riksdag is at Parliament House (), on the island of Helgeandsholmen in central Stockholm, in Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm. The Riksdag has its institutional roots in the feudal Riksdag of the Estates, traditionally thought to have first assembled in Arboga in 1435. In 1866, following reforms of the 1809 Instrument of Government, that body was transformed into a bicameral legislature with an upper chamber () and a lower chamber ().

== Name ==
The Swedish word , in definite form , is a general term for &quot;parliament&quot; or &quot;assembly&quot;, but it is typically only used for Sweden&#x27;s legislature and certain related institutions. In addition to Sweden&#x27;s parliament, it is also used for the Parliament of Finland and the Estonian Riigikogu, as well as the historical German and the Danish . In Swedish use, is usually not capitalised. derives from the genitive of , referring to royal power, and , meaning diet or conference; the German word and the Danish are cognate. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; traces English use of the term &quot;Riksdag&quot; in reference to the Swedish assembly back to 1855.

== History ==
The roots of the modern Riksdag can be found in a 1435 meeting in the city of Arboga; however, only three of the estates were probably present: the nobility, the clergy and the burghers. This informal organization was modified in 1527 by the first modern Swedish king, Gustav I Vasa, to include representatives from all the four social estates: the nobility, the clergy, the burghers (property-owning commoners in the towns such as merchants etc.), and the yeomanry (freehold farmers). This form of &quot;Ständestaat&quot; representation lasted until 1866, when representation by estate was abolished and the modern bicameral parliament established. Effectively, however, it did not become a parliament in the modern sense until parliamentary principles were established in the political system in Sweden, in 1917.

On 22 June 1866, the Riksdag decided to reconstitute itself as a bicameral legislature, consisting of or the First Chamber, with 155 members and &quot;Andra kammaren&quot; or the Second Chamber with 233 members. The First Chamber was indirectly elected by county and city councillors, while the Second Chamber was directly elected by universal suffrage. This reform was a result of great discontent with the old Estates, which, following the changes brought by the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution, was no longer able to provide representation for large segments of the population.

By an amendment to the 1809 Instrument of Government, the general election of 1970 was the first to a unicameral assembly with 350 seats. The following general election to the unicameral Riksdag in 1973 gave the Government the support of only 175 members, while the opposition could mobilize an equal force of 175 members. In a number of cases a tied vote ensued, and the final decision had to be determined by lot. To avoid any recurrence of this unstable situation, the number of seats in the Riksdag was reduced to 349, from 1976 onwards.

== Powers and structure ==

The Riksdag performs the normal functions of a legislature in a parliamentary democracy. It enacts laws, amends the constitution and appoints a government. In most parliamentary democracies, the head of state commissions a politician to form a government. Under the new Instrument of Government (one of the four fundamental laws of the Constitution) enacted in 1974, that task was removed from the Monarch of Sweden and given to the Speaker of the Riksdag.
To make changes to the Constitution under the new Instrument of Government, amendments must be approved twice, in two successive electoral periods with a regular general election held in between.

There are 15 parliamentary committees in the Riksdag.

==Membership ==
As of September 2022, 163 members, or 46.7% of the 349 members are women. Five parties have a majority representation of female MPs as of 2022: the Left Party (17 of 24, 70.8%), the Green Party (12 of 18, 66.7%), the Liberals (9 of 16, 56.3%), the Center Party (13 of 24, 54.2%), and the Social Democratic Party (55 of 107, 51.4%). The party with the lowest share of female MPs is the Sweden Democrats (18 of 73, 24.7%).

Members of the Riksdag are full-time legislators with a salary of per month, as of 1 January 2025.

According to a survey investigation by the sociologist Jenny Hansson, Members of the Riksdag have an average work week of 66 hours, including side responsibilities. Hansson&#x27;s investigation further reports that the average member sleeps 6.5 hours per night.

=== Presidium === 
The presidium consists of a speaker and three deputy speakers. 
They are elected for a 4-year term. The Speaker is not allowed to vote, but the three deputies are allowed to vote.

== Government ==
The speaker of the Riksdag nominates a Prime Minister (, literally minister of state) after holding talks with leaders of the various party groups in the Riksdag. The nomination is then put to a vote. The nomination is rejected (meaning the Speaker must find a new nominee) only if an absolute majority of the members (175 members) vote &quot;no&quot;; otherwise, it is confirmed. This means the Riksdag can consent to a Prime Minister without casting any &quot;yes&quot; votes.

After being elected the Prime Minister appoints the cabinet ministers and announces them to the Riksdag. The new Government takes office at a special council held at the Royal Palace before the Monarch, at which the Speaker of the Riksdag formally announces to the Monarch that the Riksdag has elected a new Prime Minister and that the Prime Minister has chosen his cabinet ministers.

The Riksdag can cast a vote of no confidence against any single cabinet minister (), thus forcing a resignation. To succeed, a vote of no confidence must be supported by an absolute majority (175 members) or it has failed.

If a vote of no confidence is cast against the Prime Minister this means the entire government is rejected. A losing government has one week to call for a general election or else the procedure of nominating a new Prime Minister starts anew.

== Parties ==
No party has won a single majority in the Riksdag since 1968. Political parties with similar agendas consequently cooperate on several issues, forming coalition governments or other formalized alliances.

Two major blocs existed in parliament until 2019, the socialist/green Red-Greens and the conservative/liberal Alliance. The latter—consisting of the Moderate Party, Liberals, Centre Party, and Christian Democrats—governed Sweden from 2006 through most of 2014 (after 2010 through a minority government). The Red-Greens combination disbanded on 26 October 2010 but continued to be considered the main opposition until the 2014 election, following which the Social Democrats and the Green Party formed a government with support from the Left Party.

In 2019, after the 2018 election in which neither bloc won a majority of seats, the Social Democrats and Green Party formed a government with support from the Liberals and Centre Party, breaking the center-right Alliance. In March 2019, the Christian Democrats and Moderate Party signaled a willingness to talk with the Sweden Democrats.



== Elections ==
All 349 members of the Riksdag are elected in the general elections held every four years. All Swedish citizens who turn 18 years old no later than on the day of the election and have at one point been registered residents are eligible to vote. To stand for election, a candidate must be eligible to vote and be nominated by a political party. A minimum of 4% of the national vote is required for a party to enter the Riksdag, alternatively 12% or more within a constituency. Substitutes for each deputy are elected at the same time as each election, so by-elections are rare. In the event of a snap election, the newly elected members merely serve the remainder of the four-year term.

=== Constituencies and national apportionment of seats ===
The electoral system in Sweden is proportional. Of the 349 seats in the unicameral Riksdag, 310 are fixed constituency seats allocated to 29 multi-member constituencies in relation to the number of people entitled to vote in each constituency. The remaining 39 adjustment seats are used to correct the deviations from proportional national distribution that may arise when allocating the fixed constituency seats. There is a constraint in the system that means that only a party that has received at least four per cent of the votes in the whole country participates in the distribution of seats. However, a party that has received at least twelve per cent of the votes in a constituency participates in the distribution of the fixed constituency seats in that constituency.

<doc id="158661" wikidata="Q1332885" url="?curid=158661" title="Julian Beck">
<text>Julian Beck (May 31, 1925 – September 14, 1985) was an American actor, stage director, poet, and painter. He is best known for co-founding and directing the Living Theatre, as well as his role as Reverend Henry Kane, the malevolent preacher in the supernatural horror film &quot;Poltergeist II: The Other Side&quot; (1986)

== Early life ==
Beck was born on May 31, 1925, in the Washington Heights, Manhattan, to Mabel Lucille (née Blum), a teacher, and Irving Beck, a businessman. He was named after Julia Beck (née Blum), his mother&#x27;s sister and his father&#x27;s first wife, who had died in the influenza pandemic of 1918.

He briefly attended Yale University, but withdrew to pursue writing and art. He was an abstract expressionist painter in the 1940s, but his career turned upon meeting his future wife. In 1943, he met Judith Malina and quickly came to share her passion for theatre; they founded The Living Theatre in 1947.

== Career ==
Beck co-directed the Living Theatre until his death. The group&#x27;s primary influence was Antonin Artaud, who espoused the Theatre of Cruelty, which was supposed to shock the audience out of complacency. This took different forms. In one example, from Jack Gelber&#x27;s &quot;The Connection&quot; (1959), a drama about drug addiction, actors playing junkies wandered the audience demanding money for a fix.
The Living Theatre moved out of New York in 1964, after the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) shut it down when Beck failed to pay $23,000 in back taxes. After a sensational trial in which Beck and Malina represented themselves, they were found guilty by a jury.

Beck&#x27;s philosophy of theatre carried over into his life. He once said &quot;We insisted on experimentation that was an image for a changing society. If one can experiment in theatre, one can experiment in life.&quot; He was indicted a dozen times on three continents for charges such as disorderly conduct, indecent exposure, possession of narcotics, and failure to participate in a civil defense drill.

Besides his theatre work, Beck published several volumes of poetry reflecting his anarchist beliefs; two non-fiction books: &quot;The Life of the Theatre&quot; and &quot;Theandric&quot;; and made several film appearances, with small roles in &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; (1967), &quot;Love and Anger&quot; (1969), &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984), and &quot;9½ Weeks&quot; (1986). He had a role as the main antagonist in &quot;Poltergeist II: The Other Side&quot; (1986), which was released posthumously. Beck also appeared in an episode of &quot;Miami Vice&quot; that aired 13 days after his death.

== Personal life ==
Beck and Malina had an open marriage, and Beck had a long-term relationship with Ilion Troya, a male actor in the company. Malina and Beck shared a lover in Lester Schwartz, a shipyard worker who was the third husband of Andy Warhol acolyte Dorothy Podber. Beck and Malina had two children, Garrick and Isha.

=== Death ===
Beck was diagnosed with stomach cancer in late 1983, and he died two years later on September 14, 1985 at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, aged 60.

In 2004, 19 years after his death, Beck was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame. Judith Malina was inducted to the Hall of Fame the same year.

<text>William Sampson Jr. (September 27, 1933 – June 3, 1987) was a Muscogee Nation painter, actor, and rodeo performer. He is best known for his performance as the apparently mute Chief Bromden in the 1975 film &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; and as Crazy Horse in the 1977 western &quot;The White Buffalo&quot;, as well as his roles as Taylor in &quot;Poltergeist II: The Other Side&quot; and Ten Bears in 1976&#x27;s &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot;.

== Life and career ==
William &quot;Will&quot; Sampson Jr., born in Okmulgee County, Oklahoma to William &quot;Wiley&quot; Sampson Sr. and Mabel Sampson (née Lewis), was a citizen of the Muscogee Nation, a tribe from the Southeastern Woodlands. Sampson Jr. had at least five children: Samsoche &quot;Sam&quot; and Lumhe &quot;Micco&quot; Sampson (of the Sampson Brothers Duo), actor Timothy &quot;Tim&quot; James Sampson, and Robert Benjamin Sampson. The Sampson Brothers Duo are known for their traditional fancy and grass dances. His son Robert was murdered in Tulsa in 2013.

== Rodeo performer ==
Sampson competed in rodeos for about 20 years. His specialty was bronco busting, and he was on the rodeo circuit when &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; producers Saul Zaentz and Michael Douglas were looking for a large Native American to play the role of Chief Bromden. Sampson stood tall. Rodeo announcer Mel Lambert mentioned Sampson to them, and after lengthy efforts to find him, they hired him on the strength of an interview. He had never acted before.

== Actor ==
Sampson&#x27;s most notable roles were as Chief Bromden in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; and as Chief Ten Bears &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; and Taylor the Medicine Man in the horror film &quot;Poltergeist II&quot;. He had a recurring role on the TV series &quot;Vega$&quot; as Harlon Twoleaf, and starred in the movies &quot;Fish Hawk&quot;, and &quot;Orca&quot;. Sampson appeared in the production of &quot;Black Elk Speaks&quot; with the American Indian Theater Company in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where David Carradine and other Native American actors (such as Wes Studi and Randolph Mantooth) have appeared in stage productions. He also played Crazy Horse in &quot;The White Buffalo&quot; with Charles Bronson and the archetypal Elevator Attendant in Nicolas Roeg&#x27;s 1985 film, &quot;Insignificance&quot;.

== Artist ==

Sampson was a visual artist. His large painting depicting the Ribbon Dance of the Muscogee (Creek) is in the collection of the Creek Council House Museum in Okmulgee, Oklahoma. His artwork has been shown at the Gilcrease Museum and the Philbrook Museum of Art. Sampson created a series of paintings entitled: &quot;Escape of the Winged Mind&quot; that depicts life on the American Frontier. One painting in particular is called: &quot;Buffalo Kill&quot;; and can be found featured in the book &quot;Beyond Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest: The Art and Life of William Sampson, Jr&quot;. His works have sold in auction houses and galleries, including the Pierson Gallery.

== Death ==
Sampson suffered from scleroderma, a chronic degenerative condition that affected his heart, lungs, and skin. During his lengthy illness, his weight fell from to , causing complications related to malnutrition. After undergoing a heart and lung transplant at Houston Methodist Hospital in Houston, he died on June 3, 1987, of post-operative kidney failure. Sampson was 53 years old. He was interred at Graves Creek Cemetery in Hitchita, Oklahoma.

== Legacy ==
Will Sampson Road, in Okmulgee County (east of Highway 75 near Preston, Oklahoma), is named after him.

During the filming of &quot;The White Buffalo&quot;, Sampson halted production by refusing to act when he discovered that producers had hired white actors to portray Native Americans for the film. In 1983, with assistance from his personal secretary Zoe Escobar, Sampson founded the &quot;American Indian Registry for the Performing Arts&quot; for Native American actors. He also served on the registry&#x27;s board of directors.

Sampson&#x27;s son Tim Sampson appeared on the FX show &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; season four episode &quot;Sweet Dee Has a Heart Attack&quot;. The episode pays homage to Sampson&#x27;s work as Chief Bromden in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;; Tim plays &quot;Tonto&quot; after Frank (Danny DeVito) is mistaken as mentally incompetent and placed within a facility. Tim made a similar appearance in an elaborate &quot;Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; parody set in a restaurant kitchen in the second series of the British sitcom &quot;Spaced.&quot;

<doc id="158664" wikidata="Q163830" url="?curid=158664" title="Ip Man">
<text>Ip Man (born Ip Kai-man; 1 October 1893 – 2 December 1972), also known as Yip Man, was a Chinese martial arts grandmaster. He became a teacher of the martial art of Wing Chun when he was 20. He had several students who later became martial arts masters in their own right, the most famous among them being Bruce Lee.

==Early life==
Ip Man was born as Ip Kai-man () to Ip Oi-dor () and Ng Shui () as the third of four children. He grew up in a wealthy family in Foshan (Fatshan), Guangdong (Kwangtung), and received traditional Chinese education, alongside his elder brother Ip Kai-gak (), elder sister Ip Wan-mei (), and younger sister Ip Wan-hum ().

Ip started learning Wing Chun from Chan Wah-shun when he was 9 or 13. Chan was 57 at the time, and Ip became Chan&#x27;s 16th and last student. Due to Chan&#x27;s age, he was able to train Ip for only three years before suffering a mild stroke in 1909 and retiring to his village. Ip learned most of his skills and techniques from Chan&#x27;s second-most senior student, Ng Chung-sok ().

At the age of 16, with help from his relative, Leung Fut-ting, Ip moved to Hong Kong and there he attended school at St. Stephen&#x27;s College, by then a secondary school for wealthy families and foreigners living in Hong Kong. Six months after moving to Hong Kong, a classmate of Ip&#x27;s named Lai told him that a friend of Lai&#x27;s father who was an expert in Kung Fu techniques was living with them, and had offered to have a friendly sparring match with Ip.

At the time, Ip was undefeated so he eagerly accepted the challenge. He went to Lai&#x27;s house on a Sunday afternoon and, after exchanging brief pleasantries, challenged the man to a duel. The man was Leung Bik and he easily overwhelmed Ip Man. Incredulous at the speed with which he had been countered, Ip requested a second duel and was beaten again, just as soundly.

Discouraged by his defeat, Ip left without a word and afterwards was so depressed that he did not dare mention that he knew Kung Fu. A week later, Lai told him that the man he had fought was asking after him. Ip replied that he was too embarrassed to return, at which point Lai told him that Leung Bik had highly praised his Kung Fu techniques and that he was the son of Leung Jan, who trained Ip&#x27;s master, Chan Wah-shun. Ip proceeded to train with Leung Bik, until Leung&#x27;s death in 1911.

Ip returned to Foshan in 1916 when he was 24 and became a police officer there for the Nationalist government. He taught Wing Chun to several of his subordinates, friends, and relatives, but did not officially run a martial arts school. Noted students of this time were Lok Yiu, Chow Kwong-yue (周光裕), Kwok Fu (郭富), Lun Kah (倫佳), Chan Chi-sun (陳志新), and Lui Ying (呂應 ). Chow Kwong-yue was regarded as most talented of Ip&#x27;s Foshan students, but he devoted himself to trade and abandoned the martial arts. Kwok Fu and Lun Kah began teaching and spreading the art of Wing Chun in the Foshan and Guangdong region. Cahn Chi-sun and Lui Ying moved to Hong Kong but neither accepted students.

He married Cheung Wing-sing and they had several children: sons Ip Chun and Ip Ching, and daughters Ip Nga-sum () and Ip Nga-wun ().

During the second Sino-Japanese war, Ip Man sided with Kuomintang during the conflict. What Ip Man did during the war remains unclear. It is rumoured that he had joined the Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics in its academy in Guizhou in 1938, after which he would have returned to Foshan as an undercover intelligence officer. However, the veracity of this has been disputed. It is believed Yip went to live with Kwok Fu during the war and only returned to Foshan at the end of the war.

After the war, Ip Man served for a few years as captain of the Foshan police patrols. Ip found some time to train his second son, Ip Ching, during the year 1949. At the end of 1949, after the Chinese Communist Party won the Chinese Civil War, as Ip was a member of the Kuomintang, Ip, his wife and their elder daughter, Ip Nga-sum, left Foshan for Hong Kong.

==Life in Hong Kong==
Ip, his wife Cheung, and their daughter arrived in Hong Kong through Macau in 1950. His wife and daughter later returned to Foshan to retrieve their identity cards. Due to the closure of borders between China and Hong Kong in 1951, Ip and Cheung were separated for good, with Cheung remaining in Foshan until her death.

After having moved to Hong Kong, the 56-year-old Ip Man struggled with unemployment. Ip&#x27;s only prior experience was as a policeman in Foshan, but he was either unable or refused to join the Hong Kong Police Force. Ip&#x27;s friends were able to help him get a job at a restaurant, where he would make new associates via the Hong Kong Restaurant Workers&#x27; Association. The association also had a club for martial artists, led by Leung Sheung, but Ip Man didn&#x27;t want others to know that he was a martial artist.

Ip is known to have been addicted to opium, and after moving to Hong Kong, he was able to buy it on the black market. Opium was very expensive at the time, so Ip had to earn a steady income to smoke opium while supporting his family in Foshan.

Ip began teaching Wing Chun in the early 1950s, to escape poverty and to allegedly feed his opium addiction. His earliest students
consisted mainly of &quot;poor and uneducated&quot; members of the Restaurant Workers&#x27; Association and &quot;restless and angry young men&quot;, who were attracted to Ip Man&#x27;s charismatic personality and the prospect of getting tougher in order to survive the dangerous environment of 1950s Hong Kong. Initially, Ip Man&#x27;s teaching business was poor in Hong Kong because Ip&#x27;s students typically stayed for only a couple of months. He moved his school twice, first, to Castle Peak Road in Sham Shui Po, and then to Lee Tat Street () in Yau Ma Tei by where only a few of his former students follow and continue to train under. One of the notable student was Grandmaster Chow Tze Chueng, the teacher of Sifu Donald mak. By then, some of his students had attained proficiency in Wing Chun and were able to start their own schools. They went on and sparred with other martial artists to compare their skills, and their victories helped to increase Ip&#x27;s fame.

Around 1955, he had a mistress from Shanghai, who was referred to by his students simply as &quot;Shanghai Po&quot; (). Ip and this mistress had an extramarital son named Ip Siu-wah (). In Foshan, his wife Cheung died of cancer in 1960. Ip never formally introduced his mistress to his other sons, who eventually arrived in Hong Kong to reunite with him in 1962.

By the 1960s, Ip Man was becoming more famous in the Hong Kong community. This allowed him to attract wealthier and better-educated people to become his students. In 1967, Ip and some of his students established the Ving Tsun (Wing Chun) also pronounced as &quot;Wing Chun&quot; Athletic Association (). The main purpose of the Ving Tsun Athletic Association was to help Ip tackle his financial difficulties in Hong Kong, which was due to his regular use of opium. One of his former students, Duncan Leung, claimed that Ip used tuition money to support his opium addiction. Ip&#x27;s mistress died of cancer in 1968, and their son later became a Wing Chun practitioner like his half-brothers.

==Death and legacy==

Ip died on 2 December 1972, in his unit at 149 Tung Choi Street in Hong Kong, from laryngeal cancer, only seven months before the death of Bruce Lee, his most famous student. He was buried at Wo Hop Shek, Hong Kong.

Ip&#x27;s notable students include Chu Shong-tin, Lok Yiu, Wong Shun-leung, Bruce Lee, Moy Yat, Ho Kam Ming, Victor Kan, Lo Man-kam, William Cheung, and Leung Ting.
Ip wrote a history of Wing Chun. Many artifacts of his life are on display in the Ip Man Museum on the Foshan Ancestral Temple grounds. Ip Man is portrayed in many films based on his life.

The Wing Chun lineage according to Ip Man.
== Media portrayals ==
In the 1976 film, &quot;Bruce Lee: The Man, The Myth&quot;, Ip Man&#x27;s eldest son, Ip Chun, portrayed his father in a minor role as Bruce Lee&#x27;s &quot;Wing Chun Sifu&quot;.

Ip Man was portrayed by Wang Luoyong in &quot;&quot; in a 1993 American biographical drama film based on the life of Bruce Lee, who was one of Ip&#x27;s students.

In the 1999 film, &quot;What You Gonna Do, Sai Fung?&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;1959 某日某&quot;), he was portrayed by his son, Ip Chun, again as a special appearance.

Yu Chenghui portrayed Ip Man in the 2008 Chinese television series, &quot;The Legend of Bruce Lee&quot;, which was also based on the life of Bruce Lee.

&quot;Ip Man&quot;, a Hong Kong film starring Donnie Yen as the martial artist, was released in 2008. The film takes a number of liberties with Ip&#x27;s life, often for dramatic effect. Ip&#x27;s eldest son, Ip Chun, appears in the film and served as a consultant on the production, which focuses on Ip&#x27;s life during the 1930s to the 1940s, during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

The sequel, &quot;Ip Man 2,&quot; focused on Ip&#x27;s beginnings in Hong Kong and his students, including Bruce Lee. Ip Man has taught many other people. Amid a surge of Ip Man–related film projects in production, Donnie Yen told the Chinese media in March 2010 that after &quot;Ip Man 2&quot;, he would no longer play the Wing Chun master, stating, &quot;I would never ever touch any films related to Ip Man. This will be my final film on the subject. Whenever something becomes a success, everyone would jump on the bandwagon, this is very frightening. Did you know how many Ip Man films are in production? Under such condition, we would not progress, it&#x27;d only lead to over-saturation of the subject matter.&quot;

Another Hong Kong film based on Ip Man&#x27;s life, called &quot;The Legend Is Born – Ip Man&quot;, was released in June 2010. Herman Yau directed the film and it starred Dennis To as Ip Man and Seventeen band&#x27;s Wen Junhui as his younger counterpart. Ip Chun makes a special appearance in the film as Leung Bik.

In the 2010 film, &quot;Bruce Lee, My Brother&quot;, Ip Man was portrayed by Wong Chi-wai.

Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s &quot;The Grandmaster&quot; stars Tony Leung as Ip Man. The film focuses more on the end of an era in Chinese martial arts history as the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out. It was created in an almost biographical style, highlighting parts of history. In contrast with other Ip Man–related projects, &quot;The Grandmaster&quot; is a more reflective film, focusing more on the musings and philosophies between martial arts and life, as well as Ip Man&#x27;s journey through the early 1930s to the early 1950s.

The 2013 Chinese television series &quot;Ip Man&quot;, based on Ip Man&#x27;s life, was first aired on the television network Shandong TV from late February to mid March 2013. It was directed by Fan Xiaotian and starred Kevin Cheng as the eponymous character and Zhou Jianan as the younger counterpart.

The 2013 Hong Kong film, &quot;Ip Man: The Final Fight&quot;, directed by Herman Yau and starring Anthony Wong as Ip Man, focuses on Ip&#x27;s later life in Hong Kong. Kevin Cheng from the 2013 television series &quot;Ip Man&quot; made a guest appearance as young Ip Man. Ip Chun made a cameo appearance in the film. This film also focuses on the loyalty of Ip Man&#x27;s students towards their master.

Despite Yen&#x27;s statement in March 2010 that he no longer wanted to be involved in future films related to Ip Man, a new film to the same series, &quot;Ip Man 3&quot;, was released on 24 December 2015, with Yen once again reprising his role as Ip Man.

In the 2018 action-comedy film &quot;Kung Fu League&quot;, Dennis To returned in the role of Ip Man, with three other martial artists, Wong Fei-hung, Huo Yuanjia, and Chen Zhen, whisked through time to teach martial arts to a modern-day comic book artist caught in a love triangle. Later in the movie, he reveals he&#x27;s actually an imposter, Ip Bit Man.

In the 2019 film, &quot;Ip Man and Four Kings&quot;, he was portrayed by Michael Tong. In this film, he must fight the Four Kings before he can confront a human trafficking ring and avenge the death of one of his students.

In the 2019 film, &quot;Ip Man: Kung Fu Master&quot;, Dennis To reprised the role again as Ip Man, set during his time as a police officer in Guangzhou, before the start of the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949.

Donnie Yen reprised his role as Ip Man for the last time in &quot;Ip Man 4&quot;, which focused on Ip Man coming to San Francisco to find a school for his son as he himself struggled with cancer. The film was released on 20 December 2019.

The 2022 film, &quot;Ip Man: The Awakening&quot;, sees a young Ip Man (portrayed by Miu Tse) visiting Hong Kong and becoming involved in stopping a human trafficking ring.

<doc id="158666" wikidata="Q1781678" url="?curid=158666" title="McLaughlin Motor Car Company">
<text>McLaughlin Motor Car Company Limited was a Canadian manufacturer of automobiles headquartered in Oshawa, Ontario. Founded by Robert McLaughlin, it once was the largest carriage manufacturing factory in the British Empire.

Around 1905, Robert&#x27;s son Sam starting building automobiles. By 1907, this enterprise had grown to include the manufacture of McLaughlin automobiles with Buick engines. In 1915, the company manufactured Chevrolet vehicles for the U.S. and Canadian market. The carriage end of the business was then sold to Carriage Factories Limited of Orillia, Ontario. James Brockett Tudhope&#x27;s Carriage Factories would end carriage production towards manufacturing of truck and car parts. The Tudhope firm was sold in 1924 to Cockshutt Plow Company and merged into the Cockshutt Plow owned Canada Carriage and Body Limited of Brantford, Ontario. The Brantford-based firm is now Trailmobile Canada.

McLaughlin was taken over by General Motors in 1918 and merged into General Motors of Canada.

== History ==
=== McLaughlin Carriage Company ===

Robert McLaughlin began building carriages in 1867 beside the cutters and wagons in his blacksmith&#x27;s shop in Enniskillen, a small village northeast of Oshawa, Ontario. In need of more workers to build his horse-drawn carriages, staunch Presbyterian McLaughlin moved to Oshawa in 1876.

McLaughlin developed and (in the early 1880s) patented a fifth-wheel mechanism, which greatly improved comfort and safety. Attracting a great deal of demand, he ignored tempting offers and elected to sell the mechanism to his competitors rather than license other manufacturers. This enthusiasm, now for his complete carriages, spread across Canada. Before the end of the century, there was a McLaughlin sales office in London, England.

On 7 December 1899, the carriage works was destroyed by fire. &quot;We were helpless,&quot; R.S. &quot;Sam&quot; McLaughlin later told Maclean&#x27;s Magazine, &quot;we could only stand and watch our life&#x27;s work go up in flames. Not only we McLaughlins, but the six hundred men who depended for a living on the carriage works.&quot; The City of Oshawa lent McLaughlin $50,000 to rebuild.

McLaughlin Carriage Company of Canada Limited was incorporated in 1901. Production numbers that year topped 25,000 units and included 140 different models, and sales exceeded one million dollars.

By 1915, McLaughlin was making one carriage every ten minutes. McLaughlin Carriage Company was sold to Carriage Factories Limited of Orillia, Ontario, in 1915. The major carriage manufacturers did not close their doors but switched to automobile bodies.

=== Automobile manufacturing ===
Around 1905, Robert&#x27;s son Sam became interested in manufacturing automobiles and traveled to Jackson, Michigan, to purchase a Jackson automobile. While in Jackson, Sam bumped into Billy Durant, who was manufacturing in that city. Sam and Billy had become acquainted, as both were affiliated with the carriage manufacturing business. Durant offered to make a deal, and McLaughlin purchased a Buick from a dealer in Toronto to better understand the product. Before he was halfway to Oshawa (approximately a 30-mile drive), McLaughlin knew he preferred the design of the Buick to the Jackson automobile. However, he and Durant were unable to reach a deal to combine manufacturing operations.

Instead, McLaughlin decided to form his own enterprise. In 1907, the McLaughlin Motor Car Company Limited was formed. An American engineer by the name of Arthur Milbrath was hired away from A.O. Smith to design the McLaughlin Model A automobile. &quot;We brought him [Milbrath] to Oshawa,&quot; Sam later recounted, &quot;and installed him in one of our buildings, on the west side of Mary Street, which had been set aside as the automobile shop. We equipped it with automatic lathes and other machine tools, planers, and shapers - dozens of machines. From a Cleveland firm, we ordered cylinders, pistons, and crankshafts to our specifications, and engine castings to be worked in our own shop. The car was to be more powerful than the Buick.&quot; Shortly after that, operations came to a stand-still when Milbrath fell ill with pleurisy and the vehicle could not be completed. It has been suggested that Milbraith&#x27;s ailment was actually a case of &quot;diplomatic flu&quot;, which gave the McLaughlins an excuse to partner with Durant and build Buicks. Milbrath later founded the Wisconsin Motor Manufacturing Company.

When McLaughlin wired Durant for assistance in September 1907, the next day, Durant and William H. Little, another Buick executive, arrived in Oshawa. The two carriage men, Durant and McLaughlin, hammered out a fifteen-year contract under which McLaughlin would buy drive trains from Buick Motors. These cars were sold with the brand-name McLaughlin, although the name McLaughlin-Buick also appeared on some vehicles. This alliance with Buick Motor Company was controlled by an exchange of a large parcel of McLaughlin stock for a corresponding amount of Buick stock. Durant, also a partner in Durant-Dort, had a great deal in common with Sam McLaughlin, as both were part of the largest carriage companies in their respective countries.

In 1908, the McLaughlins manufactured 154 vehicles, the same year that Durant leveraged Buick to form General Motors. Durant borrowed heavily and bought other automotive businesses for his General Motors company, including Oldsmobile, Cadillac and Oakland (Pontiac), but vehicle sales collapsed, factories were closed for twelve months, and more. In 1910, Durant lost control of General Motors to the bankers that agreed to bail out the company. The McLaughlin shares that Durant held were placed in a trust company in New York, except for one share that Durant sold to Charles Williams Nash and one to Thomas Neal.

With Sam McLaughlin&#x27;s financial help, Durant started a new business with racing driver Louis Chevrolet. Durant took control of Chevrolet and sold stock in a new business, Chevrolet Canada. In 1916, Durant regained control of General Motors, and in 1916, General Motors Corporation was formed with Sam McLaughlin as a director and vice-president. McLaughlin began manufacturing Chevrolet automobiles for Durant and General Motors. By 1914, McLaughlin had built about 1,100 of his cars.

===General Motors of Canada===
General Motors of Canada was incorporated in 1918, when it merged McLaughlin and Chevrolet Canada. General Motors Canadian Corporation spent $10 million building a Walkerville, Ontario, plant with the sale of the Chevrolet stock and establishing Canadian products. In 1923, the name of the Canadian-bodied model was officially changed to McLaughlin-Buick, and cars with this name continued to be produced until 1942. Later, production was labelled Buick without the addition of McLaughlin or Canada.

Sam McLaughlin remained chairman of the board of General Motors of Canada, and vice-president and executive director of the parent company, until his death in 1972 at the age of 100.

==The automobiles==
The first McLaughlin automobile was the 1907 Model F.

Until 1914, the cars were finished with the same paints and varnishes used on carriages. This meant each vehicle required up to fifteen coats of paint.

In 1927, the company produced two identical specially built touring cars for the Princes’ Royal Tour of Canada, one to be shipped ahead to the next city while the other was in use.

In 1936, a custom tailored McLaughlin-Buick Town Sedan was purchased by the Prince of Wales.

In 1936, the Dunsmuirs, a coal magnate family in Victoria, British Columbia, ordered three special-order 1936 Buick-McLaughlin Phaetons for three of their daughters. In 1937, the convertible phaeton bought for Elinor Dunsmuir was used to drive U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt around Victoria during his state visit. This is verified by photos appearing in the &quot;Times Colonist&quot; and the &quot;Victoria Times&quot; newspapers of 1 October 1937, because each of the Dunsmuir phaetons was unique.

Two custom built, dual-cowl McLaughlin-Buick Phaetons were built for the 1939 Royal Canadian Tour of George VI and Queen Elizabeth. One of these later carried Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales, during their 1986 visit to Canada.

==Duties and other import taxes==
Residents of other rapidly developing countries living under conditions not unlike the U.S. and Canada had a strong preference for well-engineered and robust American cars. The countries of the British Empire – England, India, South Africa, Australia, and others – gave preference by charging much lower import taxes on goods from another member of the Empire, such as Canada. Taxes were adjusted to the proportion of Canadian content. Canada made and supplied General Motors vehicles to those countries, fitting them with right-hand drive. During World War I, Britain erected high tariff barriers to protect their industry from America&#x27;s low-priced mass-produced but good-quality cars. By 1923 Canada had the world&#x27;s second-largest automotive industry. These exports fell to a trickle after World War II because Canada was part of the dollar area and therefore set apart from the British Empire&#x27;s sterling area. The British were struggling to repay U.S. War Loans and unwilling to allow their businesses unrestricted access to Canada&#x27;s currency to buy Canadian cars.

<text>Hupmobile was a line of automobiles built from 1909 through 1939 by the Hupp Motor Car Company of Detroit. The prototype was developed in 1908.

==History==

=== Founding ===

In 1909, Bobby Hupp co-founded Hupp Motor Car Company, with Charles Hastings, formerly of Oldsmobile, who put up the first US$8,500 toward manufacturing Hupp&#x27;s car. They were joined by investors J. Walter Drake, Joseph Drake, John Baker, and Edwin Denby. Drake was elected president; Hupp was vice president and general manager. Emil Nelson, formerly of Oldsmobile and Packard, joined the company as chief engineer. Hastings was named assistant general manager. In late 1909 Bobby&#x27;s brother, Louis Gorham Hupp left his job with the Michigan Central Railroad in Grand Rapids and joined the company.

====Model 20====

Hupp Motors obtained $25,000 (equal to $ today) in cash deposits at the 1909 automobile show (the lowest capitalization of Detroit&#x27;s eight major car makers) to begin manufacturing the Hupp 20. The first cars were built in a small building at 345 (now 1161) Bellevue Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. The company immediately outgrew this space and began construction of a factory a few blocks away at E. Jefferson Avenue and Concord, next to the former Oldsmobile plant. The company produced 500 vehicles by the end of the 1909 model year (the fall of 1909). Production increased to more than 5,000 in the 1910 model year.

The Model 20&#x27;s pricing was set at $900. The touring automobile was built on the same principles as the roadster. The Touring was nearly identical to the runabout aside from a longer wheelbase, a stronger frame, a stronger rear axle, and other critical pieces.

The four-cylinder engine had a bore of 3 1/4 inches and a stroke of 3 3/8 inches and was rated at 16 to 20 horsepower. The valves were on the motor&#x27;s left side, with spark plugs over the inlets and relief cocks over the exhaust. The flywheel also served as a fan, and cars delivered to hot areas were equipped with an extra belt-driven fan. The engine was lubricated with a unique Hupp system oil good for a 250 to 300-mile trip.
The car had a 110-inch wheelbase and was fitted with 30 × 3 1/2-inch tires in front and 31 × 3 1/2-inch tires in the rear. This model never became popular partly because of the low power and only a two-speed transmission with very wide-spaced ratios. The low-speed ratio was 2.7 to one, and the high speed was direct reverse had the same ratio as the low, which meant that the car moved quite fast when it went backward.
It had a distinct selling value in that the car was guaranteed to be free of material and workmanship problems. Furthermore, the manufacturer would replace any damaged material at no cost except for the tires.

=== The &quot;All-Steel&quot; Hupp 32 ===
In 1911 Hupp became one of two automakers pioneering the use of all-steel bodies, joining BSA in the U.K.

Nelson approached Hale &amp; Kilburn Company in Philadelphia looking for help with developing an all-metal body for the Hupp 32. Hale &amp; Kilburn had pioneered the replacement of cast iron with pressed steel for many parts for the interiors of railway carriages. According to Nelson, &quot;None of the Detroit plants would contract&quot; to make an all-steel body for the Hupp 32. Edward Budd and Joseph Ledwinka were employed at Hale &amp; Kilburn at the time, Budd as the general manager and Ledwinka as engineer. Budd was interested in the project. Hale &amp; Kilburn had built some body panels for King and Paige but Budd had grander aspirations the Hupp project would permit him to pursue.

Budd and Ledwinka worked with Nelson to develop means to manufacture Nelson&#x27;s design for this body. They devised a system where the body&#x27;s numerous steel stampings were welded together by hand and supported by a crude system of angle iron supports that held the welded subassemblies together. The disassembled bodies were shipped by rail to Detroit where they were put back together, painted and trimmed in the Hupmobile factory. Both the touring car and a coupe were made by this process and even one Hupmobile limousine. In 1911 no one, not Nelson, Ledwinka or Budd, thought to patent the process to manufacture all-steel bodies.

While the Hupp 32 bodies were in production, Budd and Ledwinka left and formed the Edward G. Budd Manufacturing Company. In 1914, Ledwinka filed for and received a patent for the process of making all-steel bodies. However, Budd later lost a patent infringement litigation it brought against C.R. Wilson Body Company when the court held that the Ledwinka patent was invalid. &quot;[A]fter the art had developed...Ledwinka has endeavored to go back and cover by a patent that which had become public property... [H]e is endeavoring to bring under his patent those things which belong to the public.&quot; The court relied on the production of the Hupp 32 in 1911 as a major example of the prior art. The opinion does provide insight as to what was or was not novel about the process to manufacture the Hupp 32&#x27;s body.

When Hupp left Hupp Motors in 1913, he informed the company his supplier companies would devote their full capacity to make parts for RCH. Facing the loss of manufactured parts from Hupp Corporation and increasing demand for the Hupmobile, Hupp Motors acquired seven acres for a new factory at Mt. Elliott and Milwaukee. It moved into the new plant in late April 1912. (This factory was demolished as part of site clearance for General Motors&#x27; &quot;Poletown&quot; assembly plant in the early 1980s.) Hupp Motors sold the Jefferson Avenue plant to the King Motor Car Company.

Several thousand all-steel touring cars were made before Nelson resigned as Chief Engineer in 1912. Hupmobile&#x27;s commitment to this leading-edge approach did not survive his departure. The rest of the Hupp 32 production used conventional body assembly processes.

=== Expansion ===
Carl Wickman, a car dealer in Hibbing, Minnesota, used an unsold 7-passenger model as the first vehicle for what became Greyhound. In 1913 Frank E. Watts was hired as a designer.

Hupp Motor Car Company continued to grow after its founder left. Hupp competed strongly against Ford and Chevrolet. DuBois Young became company president in 1924, advancing from vice-president of manufacturing. By 1928 sales had reached over 65,000 units. To increase production and handle sales growth, Hupp purchased the Chandler-Cleveland Motors Corporation (Chandler Motor Car) for its manufacturing facilities.

===Decline===
Sales and production began to fall even before the depression in 1930. A strategy to make the Hupmobile a larger, more expensive car began with the 1925 introduction of an 8-cylinder model, followed by the elimination of the 4-cylinder Hupmobile after 1925. (Hupmobile made only 4-cylinder cars from 1909 to 1925.) While aiming for a more lucrative market segment, Hupp turned its back on its established clientele. This was the same mistake that many other medium-priced carmakers made at the same time. In an attempt to capture every possible sale, they offered many different models. With Hupmobile&#x27;s low production volume, the result was that no model could be produced in sufficient quantity to achieve economy of scale.

===Newer models===
Hupp abandoned its more conservatively styled product line and turned to Raymond Loewy to design its 1932 Hupp cyclefender, a flashy roadster that did well at the track, but sales continued to decline. 1934 saw the introduction of a striking restyle called the &quot;Aerodynamic&quot; by Loewy, as well as the lower-priced series 417-W using Murray-built slightly-modified Ford bodies.

Despite technical innovations, squabbles among stockholders and an attempted hostile takeover in 1935 took their toll on the company. By 1936 the company was forced to sell some of its plants and assets and in 1937 Hupmobile suspended manufacturing.

A new line of six- and eight-cylinder cars was fielded for 1938, but by this time Hupp had very few dealers, and sales were disappointingly low.

Desperate for a return to market strength, on February 8, 1938, Hupmobile acquired the production dies of the Gordon Buehrig-designed Cord 810, paying US$900,000 for the tooling. Hupmobile hoped using the striking Cord design in a lower-priced conventional car, called the Skylark, would return the company to financial health. Enthusiastic orders came in by the thousands, but production delays soured customer support.

===Joint venture===

Lacking adequate production facilities, Hupmobile partnered with the ailing Graham-Paige Motor Co. to share the Cord dies. Hupmobile and Graham both sold similar models, all to be built at Graham-Paige&#x27;s facilities. While each marque used its own power train, the Graham edition, called the Hollywood, differed from the Skylark in a few minor details.

===Closure===
In 1939, deliveries of the Hupmobile Skylark finally began. Unfortunately, it had taken too many years to produce and most of the orders had been canceled. Production lasted only a couple of months, and only 319 Skylarks were produced. Hupmobile ceased production in late summer. Graham-Paige suspended production shortly after the last Hupmobile rolled off the line.

==Technical innovations==
In a constant effort to remain competitive, Hupp introduced a number of new features. They were one of the first U.S. automakers to equip their cars with &quot;free wheeling&quot;, a device that enjoyed immense, but brief, popularity in automobiles in the 1930s. Hupmobile also pioneered fresh-air car heaters with the Evanair-Conditioner.

==Legacy==
In 1914, Eric Wickman tried to establish a Hupmobile dealership but could not sell them so he started transporting miners in one of the vehicles and founded Greyhound Lines. The National Football League was created at Ralph Hay&#x27;s Hupmobile dealership in Canton, Ohio, in 1920.

The Skylark&#x27;s grille later inspired the grilles used on Lincoln Continental models in the 1940s. Their heater technology became widely adopted in the industry. Buick picked up the Skylark name for its own convertible and one-off coupe models in 1953; the nameplate was subsequently used on a midsize model from 1961 to 1973, then on a compact model from 1975 to 1998. The Hupmobile dealership in Omaha, Nebraska, is a prominent historic landmark. The dealership building in Washington, D.C., is now the H Street Playhouse.

<doc id="158674" wikidata="Q2747919" url="?curid=158674" title="Belisha beacon">
<text>A Belisha beacon () is a yellow-coloured globe lamp atop a tall black and white striped pole, marking pedestrian crossings of roads in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and other countries historically influenced by Britain, such as Hong Kong, Cyprus, Malta, New Zealand and Singapore. The beacons were named after Leslie Hore-Belisha (1893–1957), the Minister of Transport who, in 1934, added beacons to pedestrian crossings, marked by large metal studs in the road surface. These crossings were later painted in black and white stripes, and thus are known as zebra crossings. Legally, pedestrians have priority (over vehicles in the carriageway) on such crossings.

== History ==
The UK Ministry of Transport decided to erect ‘Belisha beacons’ at kerbside, alongside pedestrian crossings. The first Belisha beacons were erected in the London authorities areas and, following the Road Traffic Act 1934, were rolled out nationally in 1935. In December 1941, a study was made into the cost effectiveness of melting down the 64,000 Belisha beacon posts to make munitions, a plan which threatened to &quot;deprive the right hon. Member for Devonport (Mr. Hore-Belisha) of his last hope of immortality.&quot;

In 1948, the Central Office of Information produced a short film which showed the correct way to use a pedestrian crossing (without the stripes at this time).

Belisha beacons provide additional visibility to zebra crossings for motorists, primarily at night. The UK flash rate is 750 ms on, 750 ms off. Some crossings are set so that each beacon flashes alternately to the other side, but they often fall out of synchronization over time. Beacons with an outer ring of flashing yellow LED lights, preferred for their brightness and low electricity consumption, are replacing traditional incandescent bulbs in many areas.

Some of the crossings have plastic poles that are translucent, and lit internally. This is immediately apparent in dull weather and at night. The clearly illuminated white sections announce the presence of the poles carrying the yellow globes, increasing the visibility of the crossings to all road users. These illuminated white sections can, however, obscure the presence of a pedestrian waiting to cross, as a driver cannot see the dark shape behind the brighter light coming from the pole.

To be legally compliant in the UK, every zebra crossing must be equipped with two Belisha beacons. In cases where there is a traffic island or central reservation in the road, the traffic authority can opt whether to place one or more beacons centrally. An exception is crossings over cycle paths, which do not need beacons.

Since the introduction of new regulations in 1997, the number of zebra crossings and Belisha beacons has fallen in the northern counties of England, being replaced by pelican crossings or puffin crossings, with pedestrian-controlled traffic signals; a waiting pedestrian can stop vehicular traffic by pressing a button, and waiting for the pedestrian signal of a red and green man to change to green.

==Outside the United Kingdom==

===Australia===
In Australia, there has been a proliferation of various kinds of beacons and bollards, illuminated, reflective, or otherwise designed for high visibility at pedestrian crossings, to which the name Belisha is occasionally erroneously applied. These high-visibility crossing markers are often placed on refuge islands in the middle of the road, in addition to or instead of at the roadside. Many of these new crossings are signposted that pedestrians must give way to traffic.

Brisbane briefly had a small number of Belisha beacon marked crossings in the late 1960s and early 1970s, but the majority of Australian crossings are zebra crossings marked by large yellow circular signs bearing a walking legs symbol.

===Germany===

====East Germany====

East Germany used a unique design of Belisha beacon during the 1960s. Instead of a globe, the lamp sat in a black and yellow striped box which in turn sat on top of a yellow post. These were abolished in 1977, although use was continued on major roads until the fall of the Berlin Wall

====West Germany====

In 1956 regulations allowed for Belisha beacons to be placed at zebra crossings. Unlike Belisha beacons elsewhere, these Belisha beacons had red and white striped posts with a white globe. These were abolished in 1964

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, Belisha beacons are required by the Transport Department of Hong Kong for pedestrian crossings to be considered a &quot;zebra crossing&quot; where pedestrians have priority. The yellow globe on the beacon may be illuminated by a flashing light or by a constant light. 

Similar to the United Kingdom, two Belisha beacons are required, each to be put at each end of the zebra crossing. When there is a pedestrian refuge of central reservation, additional Belisha beacons may be added.

===Ireland===

In Ireland, Belisha beacons are usually accompanied by much higher visibility dual flashing amber traffic lights on either side. Some zebra crossings have only these rather than Belisha beacons.

In October 2022, the National Transport Authority began a pilot scheme with Limerick City and County Council and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to trial the implementation of zebra crossings without Belisha beacons, instead using fixed blue mandatory signs, such as are used in Continental Europe. These crossings will be cheaper and quicker to implement, as they do not require an electrical connection. The signs were adopted in March 2024, though beacons are still permitted to be used.

===New Zealand===
Outside of the UK, Belisha beacons are perhaps most prominent in New Zealand, where they are required at all marked pedestrian crossings. Traffic regulations require a controlling authority to erect on each pole, indicating the presence and position of a pedestrian crossing, either an internally illuminated amber globe not less than 300 mm (12&quot;) in diameter, which has a lamp that provides 40 to 60 flashes per minute, or a 400 mm (16&quot;) diameter fluorescent orange disk. The pole must be erected within 2 metres (6&#x27;) of each end of a crossing. The poles must be not less than 75 mm (3&quot;) in diameter, and not less than 2 metres (6&#x27;) in height, and must be clearly painted with alternate parallel bands of black and white, each having a width of approximately 300 mm (12&quot;). Disks are a relatively new addition as a replacement for illuminated globes, having only become prominent since the 1990s.

===Poland===
Belisha beacons were uncommon, but the Highway Code allowed for using them up until the early 1960s.

===Netherlands===

In the Netherlands, Belisha beacons were used from 1957 to 1962 to indicate that pedestrians had the right of way on a particular crossing. In 1962, a law was passed that extended this to all zebra crossings, and the beacons were removed. However, some still exist in Vlaardingen, in addition to the media area in Hilversum.

===Singapore===

In Singapore, all zebra crossings are marked by Belisha beacons.

===France and Spain===
In France and Spain, a small number of pedestrian crossings are illuminated by special lamp posts that have flashing amber lights on their sides that play the same role as Belisha beacons.

===Liberia===
Belisha beacons ranged all over Liberian zebra crossings from 1960 to 2010, and some were still in use from 2010 to 2013.

== Games ==
Belisha beacons inspired a popular card game called &#x27;Belisha&#x27;. It was aimed to teach road safety to children. It featured pictures of road scenes and a few notable places, like Gretna Green and Robin Hood&#x27;s Well. The gameplay was based on the game Rummy.

It also inspired an anarchic Blackpool arcade game called ‘Belisha Beacons’ in which contestants would throw balls at traffic signs.

<text>Biljana Plavšić (; born 7 July 1930) is a Bosnian Serb former politician, university professor and scientist who served as President of Republika Srpska and was later convicted of crimes against humanity for her role in the Bosnian War.

Plavšić was indicted in 2001 by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for war crimes committed during the Bosnian War. She plea-bargained with the ICTY and was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2003, to be served in a Swedish prison.

She was released on 27 October 2009 after serving two-thirds of her sentence. Plavšić is, together with Radovan Karadžić, the highest ranking Bosnian Serb politician to be sentenced. Before entering politics, she taught biology at the University of Sarajevo.

==Academic career==
Plavšić was a university professor teaching biology at the University of Sarajevo and was the Dean of the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. She is a Fulbright Scholar, and as such she spent two years at Boyce-Thompson institute at Cornell University in New York doing botany research. She then specialized in electron microscopy in London, and plant virology in Prague and Bari. She published over one hundred scientific works and papers.

==Political career==
Plavšić was a member of the Serb Democratic Party (SDS). She was the first female member of the Presidency of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, serving from 18 November 1990 until April 1992 after having been elected in the first multi-party elections in 1990 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. From 28 February 1992 to 12 May 1992, Plavšić became one of the two acting presidents of the self-proclaimed Serb Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Thereafter she became one of two Vice-presidents of the Republika Srpska and from circa 30 November 1992 she was a member of the Supreme Command of the armed forces of the Republika Srpska.

Plavšić declared that &quot;six million Serbs can die so that the remaining six million can live in freedom&quot; and considered the ethnic cleansing carried out against non-Serbs during the war to be a &quot;natural phenomenon&quot;. In July 1993, in a statement to &quot;Borba&quot;, Plavšić reportedly claimed that Bosnian Serbs are ethnically-racially superior to Bosnian Muslims and claimed that: 
The Serbs in Bosnia, particularly in the border areas, have developed a keen ability to sense danger to the whole nation and have developed a defense mechanism. In my family they used to say that the Serbs in Bosnia were much better than Serbs in Serbia [...] and remember, the defense mechanism was not created through a short period of time; it take decades, centuries [...] I am a biologist and I know: most capable of adapting and surviving are those species that live close to other species from whom they are endangered.
In 1994, Plavšić stated that she and other Serbian nationalists were unable to negotiate with Bosniaks due to genetics:

It was genetically deformed material that embraced Islam. And now, of course, with each successive generation it simply becomes concentrated. It gets worse and worse. It simply expresses itself and dictates their style of thinking, which is rooted in their genes. And through the centuries, the genes degraded further.

This statement by Plavšić, which equated a specific ethnic group with a disease or illness, has been compared to how the Nazis identified the Jews.

The Dayton Agreement, signed in 1995, banned the then President of Republika Srpska Radovan Karadžić from office and Plavšić was chosen to run as the SDS candidate for President of the Republika Srpska for a two-year mandate.

Vojislav Šešelj, at the Milošević trial, described Karadžić&#x27;s motives for nominating her.

She held very extremist positions during the war, insufferably extremist, even for me, and they bothered even me as a declared Serb nationalist. She brought Arkan and his Serb Volunteer Guard to Bijeljina, and she continued to visit him after their activities in Bijeljina and the surrounding area [...] Radovan Karadzic [...] believed her to be more extreme than himself in every way. He thought that the Western protagonists who tried eliminate him at any cost would have an even greater problem with her [...] Radovan Karadzic believed that she would continue to occupy her patriotic positions until the end. However, several months after she was elected, Biljana Plavsic changed her political orientation by 180 degrees under the influence of some Western protagonists and changed her policies completely.

She severed her ties with the SDS and formed Srpski narodni savez (Serbian People&#x27;s Alliance of the Republika Srpska), and nominated Milorad Dodik, the then member of the National Assembly of the Republika Srpska whose SNSD party had only two MPs, for Prime Minister. She lost the 1998 election to the joint candidate of the SDS and the Serbian Radical Party of the Republika Srpska Nikola Poplašen. She was a candidate of the reform &quot;Sloga&quot; coalition. During her time in prison, she released a book called &quot;Witnessings&quot; (Svjedočenja), revealing many aspects of the political life of the war-time Republika Srpska. In 1998, Plavšić rewarded Momčilo Đujić, a Chetnik commander and Nazi collaborator, with an honorary award.

==ICTY indictment and sentence==
She was indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia together with Momčilo Krajišnik and Radovan Karadžić for the &quot;creation of impossible conditions of life, persecution and terror tactics in order to encourage non-Serbs to leave the area, deportation of those reluctant to leave, and the liquidation of others&quot;. The Indictment charged Biljana Plavšić as follows:

*Two counts of genocide (Article 4 of the Statute of the Tribunal genocide; and/or, complicity to commit genocide)
*Five counts of crimes against humanity (Article 5 thereof extermination; murder; persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds; deportation; alternatively, inhumane acts)
*One count of violations of the laws or customs of war (Article 3 thereof murder)

She voluntarily surrendered to the ICTY on 10 January 2001, and was provisionally released on 6 September.

On 16 December 2002, she plea bargained with the ICTY to enter a guilty plea to one count of crimes against humanity for her part in directing the war and targeting civilians and expressed &quot;full remorse&quot; in exchange for prosecutors dropping seven other war crimes charges, including two counts of genocide. Plavšić&#x27;s statement, read in her native Serbian language, repeated her admission of guilt. It said she had refused to believe stories of atrocities against Bosniaks and Croats and accepted without question the claims that Serbs were fighting for survival.

In an interview she gave in March 2005 to the Banja Luka Alternativna Television, however, she admitted she had pleaded guilty because she could not prove her innocence, as she was unable to find witnesses who would testify on her behalf. She repeated this in an interview for Swedish &quot;Vi&quot; magazine in January 2009. She claimed to have pleaded guilty in order to avoid the remaining charges against her, including genocide. Her pleading guilty led the Hague tribunal to lower her sentence and drop the remaining charges. Plavšić would have likely have been sentenced to 20–25 years in prison if she had not pleaded guilty and all eight charges would have been taken into account.

She was sentenced to 11 years in prison. She served her sentence at the women&#x27;s prison Hinseberg in Frövi, Örebro County, Sweden (since 26 June 2003). In December 2008, the Swedish Ministry of Justice rejected a request for pardon by Plavšić. She had cited &quot;advancing age, failing health and poor prison conditions&quot; as the reasons for her request. Željko Komšić, a Croat member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina had written a letter to the Swedish authorities in September 2008 urging them not to release Plavšić, stating that &quot;any act of mercy would be big mistake and an insult to the victims and families of the victims&quot;.

On 14 September 2009, Patrick Robinson, President of the United Nations&#x27; International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, said Plavšić &quot;appears to have demonstrated substantial evidence of rehabilitation&quot; and had accepted responsibility for her crimes. The Times continued that &quot;Under Swedish law, she becomes eligible for release 27 October, after serving two-thirds of her term, though her release date has not been set.&quot; She was released on 27 October 2009. On the same day, Milorad Dodik, Prime Minister of Republika Srpska, provided an RS government jet to pick up Plavšić and welcomed her to Belgrade after her early release from a Swedish prison. Dodik cited &quot;purely moral reasons&quot; for doing so. On 10 November 2009, Milorad Dodik revealed that he seriously considered giving Plavšić an office in the Senate. He stated &quot;we are working on revising the law on the President of the Republic, which would award Plavšić, and other former presidents, the opportunity to enjoy some privileges like the office, monetary compensation, counselor, secretary, official car with a driver and so forth.&quot;

<doc id="158680" wikidata="Q4380179" url="?curid=158680" title="The Transparent Society">
<text>The Transparent Society (1998) is a non-fiction book by the science-fiction author David Brin in which he forecasts social transparency and some degree of erosion of privacy, as it is overtaken by low-cost surveillance, communication and database technology, and proposes new institutions and practices that he believes would provide benefits that would more than compensate for lost privacy. The work first appeared as a magazine article by Brin in &quot;Wired&quot; in late 1996. In 2008, security expert Bruce Schneier called the transparent society concept a &quot;myth&quot; (a characterization Brin later rejected), claiming it ignores wide differences in the relative power of those who access information.

==Synopsis==

Brin argues that a core level of privacy—protecting our most intimate interactions—may be preserved, despite the rapid proliferation of cameras that become ever-smaller, cheaper and more numerous faster than Moore&#x27;s law. He feels that this core privacy can be saved simply because that is what humans deeply need and want. Hence, Brin explains that &quot;...the key question is whether citizens will be potent, sovereign and knowing enough to enforce this deeply human want.&quot;

This means they must not only have rights, but also the power to use them and the ability to detect when they are being abused. That will only happen in a world that is mostly open, in which most citizens know most of what is going on, most of the time. It is the only condition under which citizens may have some chance of catching the violators of their freedom and privacy. Privacy is only possible if freedom (including the freedom to know) is protected first.

Brin thus maintains that privacy is a &quot;contingent right,&quot; one that grows out of the more primary rights, e.g. to know and to speak. He admits that such a mostly-open world will seem more irksome and demanding; people will be expected to keep negotiating the tradeoffs between knowing and privacy. It will be tempting to pass laws that restrict the power of surveillance to authorities, entrusting them to protect our privacy—or a comforting illusion of privacy. By contrast, a transparent society destroys that illusion by offering everyone access to the vast majority of information out there.

Brin argues that it will be good for society if the powers of surveillance are shared with the citizenry, allowing &quot;sousveillance&quot; or &quot;viewing from below,&quot; enabling the public to watch the watchers. According to Brin, this only continues the same trend promoted by Adam Smith, John Locke, the US Constitutionalists and the western enlightenment, who held that any elite (whether commercial, governmental, or aristocratic) should experience constraints upon its power. And there is no power-equalizer greater than knowledge. 

==Conceptually related works==

Brin has introduced versions of the concept into his fiction.

In &quot;Earth,&quot; the setting&#x27;s future history includes a war pitting most of the Earth against Switzerland, fueled by outrage over the Swiss allowing generations of kleptocrats to hide their stolen wealth in the country&#x27;s secretive banks. The war results in the end of secret banking and the destruction of Switzerland as a nation. In the setting&#x27;s present, surveillance by elderly retirees wearing recognizable networked camera-glasses is common.

His novel &quot;Kiln People&quot; is set in a future where cameras are everywhere and anyone can access the public ones and, for a fee, the private ones.

<text>An aircraft engine, often referred to as an aero engine, is the power component of an aircraft propulsion system. Aircraft using power components are referred to as powered flight. Most aircraft engines are either piston engines or gas turbines, although a few have been rocket powered and in recent years many small UAVs have used electric motors.

In commercial aviation the major Western manufacturers of turbofan engines are Pratt &amp; Whitney (a subsidiary of Raytheon Technologies), General Electric, Rolls-Royce, and CFM International (a joint venture of Safran Aircraft Engines and General Electric). Russian manufacturers include the United Engine Corporation, Aviadvigatel and Klimov. Aeroengine Corporation of China was formed in 2016 with the merger of several smaller companies.

The largest manufacturer of turboprop engines for general aviation is Pratt &amp; Whitney. General Electric announced in 2015 entrance into the market.

==Shaft engines==
===Reciprocating (piston) engines===
====In-line engine====
In this section, for clarity, the term &quot;inline engine&quot; refers only to engines with a single row of cylinders, as used in automotive language, but in aviation terms, the phrase &quot;inline engine&quot; also covers V-type and opposed engines (as described below), and is not limited to engines with a single row of cylinders. This is typically to differentiate them from radial engines.

A straight engine typically has an even number of cylinders, but there are instances of three- and five-cylinder engines. The greatest advantage of an inline engine is that it allows the aircraft to be designed with a low frontal area to minimize drag. If the engine crankshaft is located above the cylinders, it is called an inverted inline engine: this allows the propeller to be mounted high up to increase ground clearance, enabling shorter landing gear. The disadvantages of an inline engine include a poor power-to-weight ratio, because the crankcase and crankshaft are long and thus heavy. An in-line engine may be either air-cooled or liquid-cooled, but liquid-cooling is more common because it is difficult to get enough air-flow to cool the rear cylinders directly.

Inline engines were common in early aircraft; one was used in the Wright Flyer, the aircraft that made the first controlled powered flight. However, the inherent disadvantages of the design soon became apparent, and the inline design was abandoned, becoming a rarity in modern aviation.

&quot;For other configurations of aviation inline engine, such as X-engines, U-engines, H-engines, etc., see Inline engine (aeronautics).&quot;

====V-type engine====
Cylinders in this engine are arranged in two in-line banks, typically tilted 60–90 degrees apart from each other and driving a common crankshaft. The vast majority of V engines are water-cooled. The V design provides a higher power-to-weight ratio than an inline engine, while still providing a small frontal area. Perhaps the most famous example of this design is the legendary Rolls-Royce Merlin engine, a 27-litre (1649 in3) 60° V12 engine used in, among others, the Spitfires that played a major role in the Battle of Britain.

====Horizontally opposed engine====
A horizontally opposed engine, also called a flat or boxer engine, has two banks of cylinders on opposite sides of a centrally located crankcase. The engine is either air-cooled or liquid-cooled, but air-cooled versions predominate. Opposed engines are mounted with the crankshaft horizontal in airplanes, but may be mounted with the crankshaft vertical in helicopters. Due to the cylinder layout, reciprocating forces tend to cancel, resulting in a smooth running engine. Opposed-type engines have high power-to-weight ratios because they have a comparatively small, lightweight crankcase. In addition, the compact cylinder arrangement reduces the engine&#x27;s frontal area and allows a streamlined installation that minimizes aerodynamic drag. These engines always have an even number of cylinders, since a cylinder on one side of the crankcase &quot;opposes&quot; a cylinder on the other side.

Opposed, air-cooled four- and six-cylinder piston engines are by far the most common engines used in small general aviation aircraft requiring up to per engine. Aircraft that require more than per engine tend to be powered by turbine engines.

====H configuration engine====

An H configuration engine is essentially a pair of horizontally opposed engines placed together, with the two crankshafts geared together.

====Radial engine====

This type of engine has one or more rows of cylinders arranged around a centrally located crankcase. Each row generally has an odd number of cylinders to produce smooth operation. A radial engine has only one crank throw per row and a relatively small crankcase, resulting in a favorable power-to-weight ratio. Because the cylinder arrangement exposes a large amount of the engine&#x27;s heat-radiating surfaces to the air and tends to cancel reciprocating forces, radials tend to cool evenly and run smoothly. The lower cylinders, which are under the crankcase, may collect oil when the engine has been stopped for an extended period. If this oil is not cleared from the cylinders prior to starting the engine, serious damage due to hydrostatic lock may occur.

Most radial engines have the cylinders arranged evenly around the crankshaft, although some early engines, sometimes called semi-radials or fan configuration engines, had an uneven arrangement. The best known engine of this type is the Anzani engine, which was fitted to the Bleriot XI used for the first flight across the English Channel in 1909. This arrangement had the drawback of needing a heavy counterbalance for the crankshaft, but was used to avoid the spark plugs oiling up.

In military aircraft designs, the large frontal area of the engine acted as an extra layer of armor for the pilot. Also air-cooled engines, without vulnerable radiators, are slightly less prone to battle damage, and on occasion would continue running even with one or more cylinders shot away. However, the large frontal area also resulted in an aircraft with an aerodynamically inefficient increased frontal area.

====Rotary engine====

Rotary engines have the cylinders in a circle around the crankcase, as in a radial engine, (see above), but the crankshaft is fixed to the airframe and the propeller is fixed to the engine case, so that the crankcase and cylinders rotate. The advantage of this arrangement is that a satisfactory flow of cooling air is maintained even at low airspeeds, retaining the weight advantage and simplicity of a conventional air-cooled engine without one of their major drawbacks.
The first practical rotary engine was the Gnome Omega designed by the Seguin brothers and first flown in 1909. Its relative reliability and good power to weight ratio changed aviation dramatically. Before the first World War most speed records were gained using Gnome-engined aircraft, and in the early years of the war rotary engines were dominant in aircraft types for which speed and agility were paramount. To increase power, engines with two rows of cylinders were built.

However, the gyroscopic effects of the heavy rotating engine produced handling problems in aircraft and the engines also consumed large amounts of oil since they used total loss lubrication, the oil being mixed with the fuel and ejected with the exhaust gases. Castor oil was used for lubrication, since it is not soluble in petrol, and the resultant fumes were nauseating to the pilots. Engine designers had always been aware of the many limitations of the rotary engine so when the static style engines became more reliable and gave better specific weights and fuel consumption, the days of the rotary engine were numbered.

====Wankel engine====

The Wankel is a type of rotary engine. The Wankel engine is about one half the weight and size of a traditional four-stroke cycle piston engine of equal power output, and much lower in complexity. In an aircraft application, the power-to-weight ratio is very important, making the Wankel engine a good choice. Because the engine is typically constructed with an aluminium housing and a steel rotor, and aluminium expands more than steel when heated, a Wankel engine does not seize when overheated, unlike a piston engine. This is an important safety factor for aeronautical use. Considerable development of these designs started after World War II, but at the time the aircraft industry favored the use of turbine engines. It was believed that turbojet or turboprop engines could power all aircraft, from the largest to smallest designs. The Wankel engine did not find many applications in aircraft, but was used by Mazda in a popular line of sports cars. The French company Citroën had developed Wankel powered helicopter in 1970&#x27;s.

In modern times the Wankel engine has been used in motor gliders where the compactness, light weight, and smoothness are crucially important.

The now-defunct Staverton-based firm MidWest designed and produced single- and twin-rotor aero engines, the MidWest AE series. These engines were developed from the motor in the Norton Classic motorcycle. The twin-rotor version was fitted into ARV Super2s and the Rutan Quickie. The single-rotor engine was put into a Chevvron motor glider and into the Schleicher ASH motor-gliders. After the demise of MidWest, all rights were sold to Diamond of Austria, who have since developed a MkII version of the engine.

As a cost-effective alternative to certified aircraft engines some Wankel engines, removed from automobiles and converted to aviation use, have been fitted in homebuilt experimental aircraft. Mazda units with outputs ranging from to can be a fraction of the cost of traditional engines. Such conversions first took place in the early 1970s; and as of 10 December 2006 the National Transportation Safety Board has only seven reports of incidents involving aircraft with Mazda engines, and none of these is of a failure due to design or manufacturing flaws.

====Combustion cycles====
The most common combustion cycle for aero engines is the four-stroke with spark ignition. Two-stroke spark ignition has also been used for small engines, while the compression-ignition diesel engine is seldom used.

Starting in the 1930s attempts were made to produce a practical aircraft diesel engine. In general, Diesel engines are more reliable and much better suited to running for long periods of time at medium power settings. The lightweight alloys of the 1930s were not up to the task of handling the much higher compression ratios of diesel engines, so they generally had poor power-to-weight ratios and were uncommon for that reason, although the Clerget 14F Diesel radial engine (1939) has the same power to weight ratio as a gasoline radial. Improvements in Diesel technology in automobiles (leading to much better power-weight ratios), the Diesel&#x27;s much better fuel efficiency and the high relative taxation of AVGAS compared to Jet A1 in Europe have all seen a revival of interest in the use of diesels for aircraft. Thielert Aircraft Engines converted Mercedes Diesel automotive engines, certified them for aircraft use, and became an OEM provider to Diamond Aviation for their light twin. Financial problems have plagued Thielert, so Diamond&#x27;s affiliate — Austro Engine — developed the new AE300 turbodiesel, also based on a Mercedes engine. Competing new Diesel engines may bring fuel efficiency and lead-free emissions to small aircraft, representing the biggest change in light aircraft engines in decades.

===Power turbines===

====Turboprop====

While military fighters require very high speeds, many civil airplanes do not. Yet, civil aircraft designers wanted to benefit from the high power and low maintenance that a gas turbine engine offered. Thus was born the idea to mate a turbine engine to a traditional propeller. Because gas turbines optimally spin at high speed, a turboprop features a gearbox to lower the speed of the shaft so that the propeller tips don&#x27;t reach supersonic speeds. Often the turbines that drive the propeller are separate from the rest of the rotating components so that they can rotate at their own best speed (referred to as a free-turbine engine). A turboprop is very efficient when operated within the realm of cruise speeds it was designed for, which is typically .

====Turboshaft====

Turboshaft engines are used primarily for helicopters and auxiliary power units. A turboshaft engine is similar to a turboprop in principle, but in a turboprop the propeller is supported by the engine and the engine is bolted to the airframe: in a turboshaft, the engine does not provide any direct physical support to the helicopter&#x27;s rotors. The rotor is connected to a transmission which is bolted to the airframe, and the turboshaft engine drives the transmission. The distinction is seen by some as slim, as in some cases aircraft companies make both turboprop and turboshaft engines based on the same design.

===Electric power===
A number of electrically powered aircraft, such as the QinetiQ Zephyr, have been designed since the 1960s. Some are used as military drones. In France in late 2007, a conventional light aircraft powered by an 18 kW electric motor using lithium polymer batteries was flown, covering more than , the first electric airplane to receive a certificate of airworthiness.

On 18 May 2020, the Pipistrel E-811 was the first electric aircraft engine to be awarded a type certificate by EASA for use in general aviation. The E-811 powers the Pipistrel Velis Electro.

Limited experiments with solar electric propulsion have been performed, notably the manned Solar Challenger and Solar Impulse and the unmanned NASA Pathfinder aircraft.

Many big companies, such as Siemens, are developing high performance electric engines for aircraft use, also, SAE shows new developments in elements as pure Copper core electric motors with a better efficiency. A hybrid system as emergency back-up and for added power in take-off is offered for sale by Axter Aerospace, Madrid, Spain.

Small multicopter UAVs are almost always powered by electric motors.

==Reaction engines==
Reaction engines generate the thrust to propel an aircraft by ejecting the exhaust gases at high velocity from the engine, the resultant reaction of forces driving the aircraft forwards. The most common reaction propulsion engines flown are turbojets, turbofans and rockets. Other types such as pulsejets, ramjets, scramjets and pulse detonation engines have also flown. In jet engines the oxygen necessary for fuel combustion comes from the air, while rockets carry an oxidizer (usually oxygen in some form) as part of the fuel load, permitting their use in space.

===Jet turbines===

====Turbojet====

A turbojet is a type of gas turbine engine that was originally developed for military fighters during World War II. A turbojet is the simplest of all aircraft gas turbines. It consists of a compressor to draw air in and compress it, a combustion section where fuel is added and ignited, one or more turbines that extract power from the expanding exhaust gases to drive the compressor, and an exhaust nozzle that accelerates the exhaust gases out the back of the engine to create thrust. When turbojets were introduced, the top speed of fighter aircraft equipped with them was at least 100 miles per hour faster than competing piston-driven aircraft. In the years after the war, the drawbacks of the turbojet gradually became apparent. Below about Mach 2, turbojets are very fuel inefficient and create tremendous amounts of noise. Early designs also respond very slowly to power changes, a fact that killed many experienced pilots when they attempted the transition to jets. These drawbacks eventually led to the downfall of the pure turbojet, and only a handful of types are still in production. The last airliner that used turbojets was the Concorde, whose Mach 2 airspeed permitted the engine to be highly efficient.

====Turbofan====

A turbofan engine is much the same as a turbojet, but with an enlarged fan at the front that provides thrust in much the same way as a ducted propeller, resulting in improved fuel efficiency. Though the fan creates thrust like a propeller, the surrounding duct frees it from many of the restrictions that limit propeller performance. This operation is a more efficient way to provide thrust than simply using the jet nozzle alone, and turbofans are more efficient than propellers in the transsonic range of aircraft speeds and can operate in the supersonic realm. A turbofan typically has extra turbine stages to turn the fan. Turbofans were among the first engines to use multiple &quot;spools&quot;—concentric shafts that are free to rotate at their own speed—to let the engine react more quickly to changing power requirements. Turbofans are coarsely split into low-bypass and high-bypass categories. Bypass air flows through the fan, but around the jet core, not mixing with fuel and burning. The ratio of this air to the amount of air flowing through the engine core is the bypass ratio. Low-bypass engines are preferred for military applications such as fighters due to high thrust-to-weight ratio, while high-bypass engines are preferred for civil use for good fuel efficiency and low noise. High-bypass turbofans are usually most efficient when the aircraft is traveling at , the cruise speed of most large airliners. Low-bypass turbofans can reach supersonic speeds, though normally only when fitted with afterburners.

==== Advanced technology engine ====

The term &quot;advanced technology engine&quot; refers to the modern generation of jet engines. The principle is that a turbine engine will function more efficiently if the various sets of turbines can revolve at their individual optimum speeds, instead of at the same speed. The true advanced technology engine has a triple spool, meaning that instead of having a single drive shaft, there are three, in order that the three sets of blades may revolve at different speeds. An interim state is a twin-spool engine, allowing only two different speeds for the turbines.

===Pulsejets===

Pulsejets are mechanically simple devices that—in a repeating cycle—draw air through a no-return valve at the front of the engine into a combustion chamber and ignite it. The combustion forces the exhaust gases out the back of the engine. It produces power as a series of pulses rather than as a steady output, hence the name. The only application of this type of engine was the German unmanned V1 flying bomb of World War II. Though the same engines were also used experimentally for ersatz fighter aircraft, the extremely loud noise generated by the engines caused mechanical damage to the airframe that was sufficient to make the idea unworkable.

====Gluhareff Pressure Jet====

The Gluhareff Pressure Jet (or tip jet) is a type of jet engine that, like a valveless pulsejet, has no moving parts. Having no moving parts, the engine works by having a coiled pipe in the combustion chamber that superheats the fuel (propane) before being injected into the air-fuel inlet. In the combustion chamber, the fuel/air mixture ignites and burns, creating thrust as it leaves through the exhaust pipe. Induction and compression of the fuel/air mixture is done both by the pressure of propane as it is injected, along with the sound waves created by combustion acting on the intake stacks. It was intended as a power plant for personal helicopters and compact aircraft such as Microlights.

===Rocket===

A few aircraft have used rocket engines for main thrust or attitude control, notably the Bell X-1 and North American X-15.
Rocket engines are not used for most aircraft as the energy and propellant efficiency is very poor, but have been employed for short bursts of speed and takeoff. Where fuel/propellant efficiency is of lesser concern, rocket engines can be useful because they produce very large amounts of thrust and weigh very little.

====Rocket turbine engine====

A rocket turbine engine is a combination of two types of propulsion engines: a liquid-propellant rocket and a turbine jet engine. Its power-to-weight ratio is a little higher than a regular jet engine, and works at higher altitudes.

===Precooled jet engines===
For very high supersonic/low hypersonic flight speeds, inserting a cooling system into the air duct of a hydrogen jet engine permits greater fuel injection at high speed and obviates the need for the duct to be made of refractory or actively cooled materials. This greatly improves the thrust/weight ratio of the engine at high speed.

It is thought that this design of engine could permit sufficient performance for antipodal flight at Mach 5, or even permit a single stage to orbit vehicle to be practical. The hybrid air-breathing SABRE rocket engine is a pre-cooled engine under development.

===Piston-turbofan hybrid===

At the April 2018 ILA Berlin Air Show, Munich-based research institute :de:Bauhaus Luftfahrt presented a high-efficiency composite cycle engine for 2050, combining a geared turbofan with a piston engine core.
The 2.87 m diameter, 16-blade fan gives a 33.7 ultra-high bypass ratio, driven by a geared low-pressure turbine but the high-pressure compressor drive comes from a piston-engine with two 10 piston banks without a high-pressure turbine, increasing efficiency with non-stationary isochoric-isobaric combustion for higher peak pressures and temperatures.
The 11,200 lb (49.7 kN) engine could power a 50-seat regional jet.

Its cruise TSFC would be 11.5 g/kN/s (0.406 lb/lbf/hr) for an overall engine efficiency of 48.2%, for a burner temperature of , an overall pressure ratio of 38 and a peak pressure of .
Although engine weight increases by 30%, aircraft fuel consumption is reduced by 15%.
Sponsored by the European Commission under Framework 7 project , Bauhaus Luftfahrt, MTU Aero Engines and GKN Aerospace presented the concept in 2015, raising the overall engine pressure ratio to over 100 for a 15.2% fuel burn reduction compared to 2025 engines.

==Engine position numbering==

On multi-engine aircraft, engine positions are numbered from left to right from the point of view of the pilot looking forward, so for example on a four-engine aircraft such as the Boeing 747, engine No. 1 is on the left side, farthest from the fuselage, while engine No. 3 is on the right side nearest to the fuselage.

In the case of the twin-engine English Electric Lightning, which has two fuselage-mounted jet engines one above the other, engine No. 1 is below and to the front of engine No. 2, which is above and behind.

In the Cessna 337 Skymaster, a push-pull twin-engine airplane, engine No. 1 is the one at the front of the fuselage, while engine No. 2 is aft of the cabin.

==Fuel==
Aircraft reciprocating (piston) engines are typically designed to run on aviation gasoline. Avgas has a higher octane rating than automotive gasoline to allow higher compression ratios, power output, and efficiency at higher altitudes. Currently the most common Avgas is 100LL. This refers to the octane rating (100 octane) and the lead content (LL = low lead, relative to the historic levels of lead in pre-regulation Avgas).

Refineries blend Avgas with tetraethyllead (TEL) to achieve these high octane ratings, a practice that governments no longer permit for gasoline intended for road vehicles. The shrinking supply of TEL and the possibility of environmental legislation banning its use have made a search for replacement fuels for general aviation aircraft a priority for pilots’ organizations.

Turbine engines and aircraft diesel engines burn various grades of jet fuel. Jet fuel is a relatively less volatile petroleum derivative based on kerosene, but certified to strict aviation standards, with additional additives.

Model aircraft typically use nitro engines (also known as &quot;glow engines&quot; due to the use of a glow plug) powered by glow fuel, a mixture of methanol, nitromethane, and lubricant. Electrically powered model airplanes and helicopters are also commercially available. Small multicopter UAVs are almost always powered by electricity, but larger gasoline-powered designs are under development.
