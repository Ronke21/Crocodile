<text>Blessid Union of Souls (sometimes abbreviated to Blessid Union or BUOS) is an American alternative rock band from Cincinnati, Ohio, that was formed in 1990 by friends Jeff Pence and Eliot Sloan.

The band&#x27;s first studio album, &quot;Home&quot;, had some success which lay with its lead single, &quot;I Believe&quot;. The song popularized the band with local-area DJs and is the group&#x27;s most successful song. Their second album, the self-titled &quot;Blessid Union of Souls&quot;, did not have nearly the success of &quot;Home&quot;, but their third album, &quot;Walking Off the Buzz&quot;, spawned the hit single &quot;Hey Leonardo (She Likes Me for Me)&quot;.

After the release of their greatest-hits album, &quot;Blessid Union of Souls: The Singles&quot;, which actually collected more outtakes and B-sides than previous hits, they released &quot;Perception&quot;. The band&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, was released in 2008.

==History==

===Early years===
Blessid Union of Souls formed in 1990 with guitarist Jeff Pence (Morrow, Ohio), vocalist/pianist Eliot Sloan (Cincinnati, Ohio), keyboardist C.P. Roth (who had been in Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s touring band), and drummer Eddie Hedges. Sloan and Hedges had previously played together in a band in the 1980s called The Movies (not to be confused with the British pub rock band of the same name). The band&#x27;s name originated from an episode of the TV series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;.

The band was heavily influenced by the cowpunk scene that was burgeoning around the time they formed. The band spent several years in the early- to mid-1990s honing their craft in Newport News, Virginia and their song &quot;Oh Virginia&quot; is a tribute to their &quot;second home&quot;.

In 1992, the band sent a demo to EMI Records who immediately offered them a contract and spread the word about them.

===&quot;Home&quot; (1994–1996)===
They began writing more songs in about 1993 for their debut album, &quot;Home&quot;. It took over two years to complete, but before it was released, DJs in the Cincinnati area began playing &quot;I Believe&quot;, which would become the album&#x27;s most popular single.

They finally released &quot;Home&quot; in March 1995. Later that year, it was certified gold by the RIAA. It is now certified platinum. The album&#x27;s most popular song was the aforementioned &quot;I Believe&quot;, with reached #8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, #2 on the magazine&#x27;s Mainstream Top 40 chart, and #1 on the CHR/Pop survey from &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;. It also spawned the Top 40 hits &quot;Oh Virginia&quot; and &quot;Let Me Be the One&quot;, which was featured in the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;.

===&quot;Blessid Union of Souls&quot; (1996–1998)===
After EMI Records collapsed in 1996, the band signed with Capitol Records and added bassist Tony Clark in the process.

They released their second album, &quot;Blessid Union of Souls&quot; in 1997. This album was not as popular as &quot;Home&quot;, but still released two Top 40 hits, &quot;I Wanna Be There&quot; and &quot;Light in Your Eyes&quot;.

===&quot;Walking Off the Buzz&quot; (1999–2000)===
They released their third album, &quot;Walking Off the Buzz&quot;, in 1999. This album was moderately popular due to &quot;Hey Leonardo (She Likes Me for Me)&quot;, a single from the album that reached the Top 40 but stalled at No. 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The single did, however, reach the top ten on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Top 40 chart, where it peaked at number eight and gave the band its second top ten hit there, and the CHR/Pop chart published by &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;, peaking at number seven and giving Blessid Union of Souls its third (and, to date, last) top ten on that particular chart.

===2001–2005===
Between 2001 and 2005, Blessid Union of Souls stayed away from the studio, but they released a greatest hits album that also featured a few previously unreleased songs that were recorded around 2000. During this time, they still toured. One of their shows was at Great Valley High School in Pennsylvania. Roth and Hedges left the band in 2002 and were replaced by Kyle Robinson, and then by Shaun Schaefer on drums and Bryan Billhimer on guitar.

===&quot;Perception&quot; and reemergence (2005–2008)===
At the end of this period, the band&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Perception&quot; was released.

In the beginning of 2008, Blessid Union of Souls began touring with members Eliot Sloan, Tony Clark, Bryan Billhimer, and Shaun Schaefer, as Jeff Pence had amicably left the band in order to focus on his multimedia production career.

===&quot;Close to the Edge&quot; (2008–2010)===
Blessid Union of Souls&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, was released on September 16, 2008, on Torque Records. Eight of its twelve tracks were taken from their previous album, &quot;Perception&quot;. There was only one single released for the album, &quot;Could&#x27;ve Been with You&quot;.

===&quot;The Mission Field&quot; (2011–2012)===
The band&#x27;s debut Contemporary Christian album, &quot;The Mission Field&quot;, was released on Salvation Road Records through Sony/Provident in March 2011. The first single, &quot;The Only Song&quot;, reached number 32 on the Nielsen BDS Christian AC chart. The video for &quot;The Only Song&quot; was also added to the Gospel Music Channel &amp; JCTV.
The second single, &quot;Pray for You&quot;, was released on July 15, 2011.

=== &quot;Home 25&quot; (2020–present) ===
To celebrate the 25th anniversary of their debut album, the band released &quot;Home 25&quot;, a limited-edition vinyl album that included vintage live versions of &quot;Home&quot; classics and &quot;Home-&quot;era demo recordings.

==Other projects==
In 1995, they covered the song &#x27;Way Over Yonder&#x27; by Carole King for the tribute album &quot;Tapestry Revisited: A Tribute to Carole King&quot;.

In 1998, the band recorded &quot;Brother My Brother&quot; for &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot;, where it was used during the battle between Mew, Mewtwo, the original Pokémon, and their clones. The song was only featured in the dubbed release of the movie, as the original Japanese release contained a composed score for the battle.

In 2000, several of the band&#x27;s songs were scheduled for use during the production of a film titled &quot;Standing at the Edge of the Earth&quot; by Fizzle Freak Productions. The film would have co-starred the band&#x27;s bassist Tony Clark, and the rest of the band would have been featured in prominent roles as well. The film&#x27;s production was canceled in around the end of 2000 due to legal and financial issues.

In 2003, the band released &quot;Blessid Union of Souls: Play Ball&quot;, an album about the Cincinnati Reds. The title track was used to promote the team in their first season in Great American Ballpark. This album did not receive much attention outside of Cincinnati.

In 2005, the band recorded &quot;We are the Washington Nationals.&quot; A song to mark the 2005 Washington Nationals season, Washington, D.C.&#x27;s first MLB season since 1971.

In 2006, Jeff Pence headed a project in which the band contributed two tracks for &quot;Clutch Hits&quot;, a CD that featured a variety of artists who contributed songs about the Cincinnati Reds. The songs were titled &quot;Play Ball&quot; and &quot;Me, Marty, Joe, Ted &amp; Louise&quot;. The project was a fundraiser for the Reds Community Fund.

In 2012, they began the project Hear 2 Heal. Hear 2 Heal is an interactive, performing arts project featuring Eliot Sloan along with the performing arts students of selected schools in order to give the students an opportunity to be heard and address their issues through the music of Blessid Union and their media of choice (choir/band/theatre/AV/dance) and heal through the process of expression and opening lines of communication. The project began with Brownsburg High School in Brownsburg, Indiana, on November 2 and sought to reach to other schools in Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and Kentucky.

<doc id="166237" wikidata="Q1431711" url="?curid=166237" title="The Orioles">
<text>The Orioles were an American R&amp;B group of the late 1940s and early 1950s, one of the earliest such vocal groups who established the basic pattern for the doo-wop sound.

The Orioles are generally acknowledged as R&amp;B&#x27;s first vocal group. Baltimore natives, they blended rhythm with group harmonies. Dubbing themselves after Maryland&#x27;s state bird, the Orioles started the trend of bird groups (The Cardinals, The Crows, The Flamingos, The Larks, The Penguins, The Ravens, The Wrens, etc.). They brought their winning formula to their first charted hit &quot;It&#x27;s Too Soon to Know&quot;; a #1 record in November 1948, soon followed by the group&#x27;s second hit, &quot;(It&#x27;s Gonna Be a) Lonely Christmas&quot;, in December that same year.

==Original members==
*Sonny Til (born Earlington Carl Tilghman, August 18, 1928, Baltimore, Maryland — died December 9, 1981, Washington, D.C.) (lead tenor)
*Alexander Sharp (born December 1919, Baltimore — died January 3, 1970) (high tenor)
*George Nelson (born 1925, Baltimore — died June 30, 1959) (baritone)
*Johnny Reed (born August 16, 1923, Baltimore — died June 18, 2005) (bass vocals and double bass)
*Lloyd Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Gaither III (born March 5, 1920, Baltimore — died November 5, 1950, Baltimore) (guitar)

==Early years==
Around 1947, Sonny Til sang regularly in amateur shows at the Avenue Cafe in Baltimore, where he met Nelson, Sharp and Gaither. They decided to form a group, calling themselves The Vibra-Naires, and aspiring songwriter Deborah Chessler became their manager. In April 1948 the group appeared on the Arthur Godfrey radio talent show in New York City, with Richard Williams as bass singer, but he was then replaced by Johnny Reed.

The group won a recording deal with the &quot;It&#x27;s A Natural&quot; record label, a subsidiary of Jubilee Records, and changed their name to The Orioles in honor of the state bird of Maryland and in emulation of another popular group, The Ravens. In July 1948, they recorded Chessler&#x27;s song &quot;It&#x27;s Too Soon to Know&quot;, with Sonny Til taking lead vocals. The record reportedly sold 30,000 copies in its first week, rising to #1 on the national R&amp;B charts in November 1948, and leading to cover versions by artists such as the Ravens, Ella Fitzgerald and Dinah Washington. It was also one of the first &quot;race&quot; songs to cross over into mainstream markets, reaching # 13 on the pop charts.

The Orioles then began touring widely, and started recording for the Jubilee label. Their next smash hit was &quot;Tell Me So&quot; in 1949, which again reached # 1 in the R&amp;B chart but this time failed to cross to the pop charts. Other hits included &quot;Forgive And Forget&quot; and &quot;Lonely Christmas&quot;.

In performance, The Orioles were a phenomenon, with girls in the audiences screaming, fainting, and attempting to reach their idol Sonny Til in particular. They differed from groups like the Mills Brothers and the Delta Rhythm Boys in that they made vocal music with limited orchestration and accompanied only with the guitar of Tommy Gaither and the bass Johnny Reed. From 1948 to 1954, they cut over 120 sides for the Natural and Jubilee labels. By late 1950 they were major stars, although their supply of hit records had dried up.

Tragedy struck in November 1950. The group was traveling in two cars near Baltimore. Gaither drove one, with Reed and Nelson as passengers. He took a corner too fast and lost control of the car, which rolled down an embankment and crashed into a drive-in restaurant. Gaither was killed and Nelson and Reed were severely injured. Til and Sharp, in the other car, were not near enough to witness the accident and only heard about it when they arrived home.

For a short time, only Til and Sharp performed as the Orioles, but soon added two new members, guitarist/second tenor Ralph Williams and pianist Charlie Harris. Nelson returned in a few days, and Reed a few weeks later. Just a year after their tragic accident, the group were involved in another accident in Akron, Ohio, but there were no injuries. In 1952, they had another R&amp;B hit with blues song &quot;Baby Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, which was an early 45rpm issue available only on red vinyl.

Early in 1953, George Nelson, who had a drinking problem, left the Orioles, and was replaced by John &quot;Gregory&quot; Carroll, formerly of another Baltimore group, the Four Buddies. In June 1953, they recorded a version of Darrell Glenn&#x27;s country song &quot;Crying in the Chapel&quot;. This was to become The Orioles&#x27; biggest hit, staying at # 1 in the R&amp;B charts for five weeks in August and September, and reaching # 11 on the pop charts. it sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. It was also to be their last big hit, with only a version of &quot;In The Mission Of St. Augustine&quot; later in the year reaching the R&amp;B charts.

Williams left the group briefly in late 1953, and in 1954 the group&#x27;s manager Deborah Chessler quit. In February 1955, Reed left and eventually joined a version of The Ink Spots. He was replaced by Maurice Hicks. Williams and Harris left soon after. The group continued a short time, but then disbanded.

==Later years==
Left without the Orioles, Til picked up another group, the Regals, whose members were Tex Cornelius, Diz Russell, Jerry Holeman, Billy Adams, and pianist Paul Griffin. This group became the New Orioles. Til liked the Regals&#x27; modern harmony style, and the existing tunes were rearranged to match the Regals&#x27; style (in many cases, sounding rather different than they formerly had). During this time, they were often billed as &quot;Sonny Til and his New Orioles&quot;. They left Jubilee and signed with Vee-Jay Records.

They continued with this arrangement until 1957 when Cornelius left the group. He was replaced for a short time by Frank Todd, who was replaced by Jimmy Brown. This line-up went until the last day of 1959. Holeman left the group, and Russel the next day, after finding Sonny&#x27;s car (their means of transportation) repossessed. This was the end of the second Orioles.

Til recorded briefly as a solo artist before putting together the third Orioles group, with members Delton McCall, Billy Taylor, and Gerald Gregory, former bass of The Spaniels. They continued recording, this time for Charlie Parker Records. Gregory left after a couple of years and was replaced by Lawrence Joyner. This group split up in the mid 1960s.

In 1966, Til met Bobby Thomas, a long time Orioles fan. Bobby was singing in a group known as the Vibrannaires — coincidentally the same as the Orioles&#x27; original name. This group consisted of Thomas, Clarence Young, Harry Accoo, and Mike Robinson. Thomas, Young, and Robinson joined Til to become the fourth Orioles group. Gregory Carroll was occasionally a member of this group. They recorded until 1975.

Following the breakup of that Orioles group, Til joined George Holmes&#x27; Ink Spots, who were Til, Holmes, Ann Lawson, and Larry Reed. With the addition of George &quot;Pepi&quot; Grant in 1977, they began touring as both The Ink Spots and The Orioles (as the Orioles, Lawson was billed as a special guest). Til and Grant alternated leads, and Holmes sang bass. They recorded briefly in 1977.

In 1977, Til formed the sixth Orioles group with former members: Diz Russell and Jerry Holeman from the second group, and Billy Taylor from the third group. The group also sometimes featured Eddie Palmer. This group was together in 1981, when Til died from a heart attack. He was 53.

The group continued, and by the late 1990s featured Russell, Reese Palmer, Skip Mahoney, Larry Jordan and musical director Eddie Jones, who also works with The Cadillacs. Jones and Mahoney were later replaced by George Spann and Royal Height. Bobby Thomas started his own Orioles group following Til&#x27;s death. Johnny Reed played with this group until his death in June 2005.

Bobby Thomas died on May 3, 2012, from complications of diabetes at the age of 77. John Gregory Carroll died on January 25, 2013, in Creston.

Lead singer Albert &quot;Diz&quot; Russell died November 16, 2016, from congestive heart failure at the age of 83.

Dwight Datcher died on November 23, 2019

Skip Mahoney died on March 20, 2020

==Recognition==
The original five members of The Orioles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 as early influences.

Both groups were featured in the PBS special &quot;Doo Wop 51&quot; in 2000, with the groups alternating verses on &quot;Crying in the Chapel&quot; (with Bobby Thomas and Larry Jordan on lead).

In 2015 the musical theater production, &quot;Soul Harmony&quot;, telling the story of Deborah Chessler, Sonny Til, and the Orioles, premiered in Portland, Oregon.

They were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1998.

<doc id="166238" wikidata="Q1487770" url="?curid=166238" title="Shawn Mullins">
<text>Shawn Mullins (born March 8, 1968) is an American singer-songwriter who specializes in folk rock, instrumental rock, adult alternative, and Americana music. His 1998 single &quot;Lullaby&quot;, hit number one on the Adult Top 40 and was nominated for a Grammy Award.

==Early life and military career==
Mullins was born in Atlanta, Georgia. He cultivated an interest in music beginning in his days at Clarkston High School in Clarkston, Georgia (where he made the acquaintance of friend and mentor Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls). Later, he honed his craft in his college days at University of North Georgia (then known as North Georgia College) as a solo acoustic musician and bandmaster of the military marching band (Golden Eagle Band). He attended the University of North Georgia on an Army ROTC scholarship with an intention of possibly pursuing a military career. Although he quickly abandoned this notion in favor of songwriting, the contract nonetheless obliged him after graduation to serve a short term as an inactive infantry officer in the Individual Ready Reserve component of the U.S. Army Reserve. He served in an inactive status, reaching the rank of 1st lieutenant before fulfilling his service obligation and resigning honorably.

==Career==

===Shawn Eric Mullins with Twice Removed and solo career===
Soon, he added a drummer (Mickey Hendrix) and bassist (Carlton Brown) to form the power pop trio billed as &quot;Shawn Eric Mullins with Twice Removed&quot;, a combo that would help carry him to campus-wide and regional renown. Eventually the &quot;Twice Removed&quot; trio parted ways under amicable terms, and Mullins began using a variety of collaborative lineups while building his reputation as a solo artist.

===Commercial success===
His critical breakthrough came when his song &quot;Lullaby&quot;, from the album &quot;Soul&#x27;s Core&quot;, became a radio and video hit. In the video for &quot;Lullaby&quot;, directed by Roger Pistole, actress Dominique Swain appeared. His song, &quot;All in My Head&quot;, featured on the sitcom &quot;Scrubs&quot;, was written in response to an e-mail sent by producers of the show searching for a theme song. Mullins wrote a demo version and sent it in within 24 hours. It wasn&#x27;t selected as the theme song, but the demo version was used in a season one episode of the series.

Another single, &quot;Shimmer&quot;, was included on the soundtrack for &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; and was a minor hit. &quot;Shimmer&quot; was also used in Australia as part of its promotional campaign during the 2000 Summer Olympics, and is still considered in Australia as the unofficial anthem of the games. To date he has yet to match the overwhelming commercial success of &quot;Lullaby&quot;, which was also released as a live performance on the charity album &quot;Live in the X Lounge II&quot; in 1999. In early 2002, he formed the band The Thorns with Matthew Sweet and Pete Droge.

===Vanguard Records===
In 2006, Mullins released his first album on new label Vanguard Records, &quot;9th Ward Pickin Parlor&quot;, as well as a new single, entitled &quot;Beautiful Wreck&quot;, from the album. The single enjoyed modest success by reaching number one on the Americana and AAA (Adult Album Alternative), and was featured in the Cities 97 Sampler Volume 18.

On March 11, 2008, Mullins released his second album on Vanguard, entitled &quot;Honeydew&quot;. On October 12, 2010, Mullins released his third album on Vanguard, &quot;Light You Up&quot;.

===Sugar Hill and Rounder Records===
On October 23, 2015, Mullins released his new album, titled &quot;My Stupid Heart&quot;, under Sugar Hill and Rounder Records.

==Personal life==
Mullins has been married and divorced three times. He has one son.

<text>Ralph Herman Abraham (July 4, 1936 – September 19, 2024) was an American mathematician. In 1968 he became a member of the faculty of the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), and later stayed on as a professor emeritus of mathematics.

== Life and work ==
Abraham earned his BSE (1956), MS (1958), and PhD (1960) from the University of Michigan. His PhD thesis, titled &quot;Discontinuities in General Relativity&quot;, was written under the direction of Nathaniel Coburn. Prior to joining UCSC, he held positions at the University of California, Berkeley (research lecturer in mathematics; 1960–1962), Columbia University (postdoctoral fellow and assistant professor of mathematics; 1962–1964) and Princeton University (assistant professor of mathematics; 1964–1968). He has also held visiting positions in Amsterdam, Paris, Warwick, Barcelona, Basel, and Florence.

He founded the Visual Math Institute at UCSC in 1975; at that time, it was called the &quot;Visual Mathematics Project&quot;. He was editor of &quot;World Futures&quot; and for the &quot;International Journal of Bifurcations and Chaos&quot;. Abraham was a member of cultural historian William Irwin Thompson&#x27;s Lindisfarne Association.

Abraham has been involved in the development of dynamical systems theory since the 1960s and 1970s. He has been a consultant on chaos theory and its applications in numerous fields, such as medical physiology, ecology, mathematical economics, and psychotherapy.

Another interest of Abraham&#x27;s concerns alternative ways of expressing mathematics, for example visually or aurally. He has staged performances in which mathematics, visual arts and music are combined into one presentation. Abraham developed an interest in &quot;Hip&quot; activities in Santa Cruz in the 1960s and had a website gathering information on the topic. He credited his use of the psychedelic drug DMT with &quot;swerv[ing his] career toward a search for the connections between mathematics and the experience of the Logos&quot;.

Abraham died at his home in Santa Cruz County, at the age of 88.

<text>Peter Andreyevich Arshinov (; 1887–1937), was a Russian anarchist revolutionary and intellectual who chronicled the history of the Makhnovshchina.

Initially a Bolshevik, during the 1905 Revolution, he became active within the Ukrainian anarchist movement, taking part in a number of terrorist attacks against Tsarist officials. He was arrested for his activities and imprisoned in Butyrka prison, where he met Nestor Makhno.

Following the 1917 Revolution, he was released from prison and returned to Ukraine to join Makhno&#x27;s partisan movement. Arshinov became a leading intellectual figure within the Makhnovist movement, as editor of its main newspaper, and chronicled the development of events as the movement&#x27;s official historian.

When the movement was suppressed by the Bolsheviks, he went into exile, where he participated in the publication of the &quot;Organisational Platform&quot; and the debates surrounding it. By the 1930s, he had moved back towards Bolshevism and decided to return to the Soviet Union, where he was executed during the Great Purge.

== Biography ==
In 1887, Peter Andreyevich Arshinov was born into a working-class family, in a village in Penza Governorate of the Russian Empire. At the age of 17, Arshinov moved to Turkestan, where he worked as a machinist. 

===Early revolutionary activities===
With the outbreak of the 1905 Revolution, he joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Party and edited its underground newspaper &quot;Molot&quot; (). When Arshinov caught the attention of the police for his revolutionary activity, he moved to the Ukrainian city of Katerynoslav, where he split with the Bolsheviks over ideological disagreements and became a member of the anarchist movement. In December 1906, following the repression of revolutionary elements, Arshinov led the formation of an anarchist terrorist cell in Katerynoslav and organised a series of attacks, including the bombing of a police station and the assassination of a government official. 

On 7 March 1907, Arshinov publicly assassinated a railway boss in Oleksandrivsk. He was quickly arrested and sentenced to be hanged, but his sentence was commuted and he used this time to plan an escape. He broke out of prison on Easter Sunday, and fled first to France then to Austria-Hungary, where he engaged in arms trafficking and the smuggling of anarchist propaganda into the Russian Empire. In 1911, he was arrested again and extradited to Russia, where he was sentenced to 20 years in Butyrka prison.

===With the Makhnovshchina===
In prison, Arshinov was acquainted with the young Ukrainian anarchist Nestor Makhno, who he took under his wing as a pupil, teaching him Russian language and literature, mathematics, geography, history, economics and politics. Following the February Revolution, they were released from prison as part of a general amnesty. While Makhno returned home to Ukraine, Arshinov remained behind in Moscow and began organising with the local Anarchist Federation, spending most of his time in Moscow publishing the works of Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin.

Following the October Revolution, he quickly became demoralised by the direction of events and lost interest in himself returning to Ukraine. As a consequence of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Ukraine was invaded and occupied by the Central Powers, with support from the Ukrainian nobility. The peasants reacted by carrying out a campaign of guerrilla warfare against the occupation forces and their Ukrainian collaborators, as part of a war of independence that spread throughout the country. One of these peasant insurgent bands was led by Nestor Makhno, who defeated the occupation forces at the battle of Dibrivka and captured much of his home region, becoming the leader of a mass movement of the Ukrainian peasantry which declared him their &quot;Bat&#x27;ko&quot; ().

In the wake of the anarchist victory, Arshinov joined a number of other Russian anarchist intellectuals in emigrating to Ukraine, where they established the Nabat, a confederation of anarchist organisations. In April 1919, Arshinov arrived in Huliaipole, where he was reunited with Makhno and joined his movement, becoming a leading ideologue within the Cultural-Educational Department. The following month, Arshinov began editing the movement&#x27;s newspaper &quot;The Road to Freedom&quot;, which published 50 issues in the Katerynoslav region until November 1920. During this period, Arshinov observed the nascent Makhnovist movement establishing agricultural communes, organised according to the communist principle of &quot;from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs&quot;. 

The anarchist region soon came under attack by the White movement, which forced them to negotiate an alliance with the Red Army, which had also invaded Ukraine. While on their way to meet the Bolshevik delegate Lev Kamenev in Huliaipole, Arshinov witnessed Makhno execute one of his own followers for antisemitism. He then observed Makhno and Kamenev&#x27;s meeting, which initially seemed amicable, but which Arshinov later came to question the intent of. By May 1919, relations between the Bolsheviks and anarchists had become strained by political divisions and by the collapse of the Donbas front, which Arshinov blamed on Red Army commanders, who he claimed had deliberately deprived the insurgents of weaponry. Makhno soon resigned his command and, now under attack by both the Reds and the Whites, resolved to retreat into the west. 

Arshinov joined the Makhnovists in their westward retreat, during which he witnessed large numbers of people joining the newly constituted Insurgent Army, was present for the assassination of Nykyfor Hryhoriv, and at the battle of Peregonovka. There the Insurgent Army defeated the Volunteer Army and subsequently captured most of southern Ukraine, to which Arshinov himself attributed the defeat of the entire White movement. Arshinov then observed what he considered to be a failure to establish either political or military control over left-bank Ukraine, which he blamed on the outbreak of epidemic typhus within the ranks of the Makhnovshchina. The Red Army took the opportunity to attack the Makhnovshchina, which Arshinov estimated to have eventually resulted in the execution of almost 200,000 Ukrainian peasants by the Bolsheviks.

After months of fighting between the Makhnovists and Bolsheviks, a White offensive into Taurida forced them into an agreement, which brought about the brief cessation of hostilities between the two factions. Arshinov himself justified the pact as a way of bringing them closer together with the mass base that the Bolsheviks had in the proletariat. But following their combined victory over the Whites in the siege of Perekop, Arshinov witnessed the subsequent Bolshevik offensive against the Makhnovshchina on 26 November, in what Arshinov insisted to have been a premeditated attack.

He then witnessed the subsequent period of guerrilla warfare against the Red Army, documenting their pursuit across the country. Despite the danger, Arshinov remained with Makhno until the spring of 1921, when he and his wife clandestinely crossed the border into Poland and then went on to Germany.

===Exile===
In 1922, Arshinov arrived in Berlin, where he completed his &quot;History of the Makhnovist Movement&quot;. He then moved on to Paris in 1925, where he established the anarchist journal &quot;Delo Truda&quot; (). Meanwhile, he earned a living by making handmade shoes, as part of a scheme for Russian refugees, which lasted until competition from a French industrial manufacturer made it no longer profitable.

On 20 June 1926, Arshinov participated in the publication of the &quot;Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists&quot;, which lay out a framework for how anarcho-communists could politically organise, through theoretical and tactical unity, collective responsibility and federalism. This caused an immediate controversy within the anarchist movement, with Arshinov being accused of Bolshevism by anarchists such as Alexander Berkman and Volin, the latter of whom claimed Arshinov intended to establish an anarchist political party along bureaucratic and centralist lines.

By 1931, Arshinov had broken with the anarchist movement and began openly expressing support for the Soviet government of Joseph Stalin. By this time, Arshinov&#x27;s wife grown weary of life in exile and wanted their family to return to Russia, which the Bolshevik politician Sergo Ordzhonikidze offered to sponsor. Despite warnings by Volin, who predicted that he would be executed for his anarchist past, in 1934, Arshinov finally returned to the Soviet Union, where he found work as a proofreader. Only three years later, Arshinov was arrested and shot during the Great Purge, on charges of having allegedly propagandised for anarchism upon his return to Russia.

<text>Korpokkur (; ), also written Koro-pok-kuru, korobokkuru, korbokkur, or koropokkur, koro-pok-guru, are a race of little people (mythology) in folklore of the Ainu people of the northern Japanese islands. The name is traditionally analysed as a tripartite compound of &quot;kor&quot; (&quot;butterbur plant&quot;), &quot;pok&quot; (&quot;under, below&quot;), and &quot;kur&quot; (&quot;person&quot;) and interpreted to mean &quot;people below the leaves of the Fuki&quot; in the Ainu language.

The Ainu believe that the &quot;korpokkur&quot; were the people who lived in the Ainu land before the Ainu themselves lived there. They were short of stature, agile, and skilled at fishing. They lived in pits with roofs made from butterbur leaves. Long ago, the &quot;korpokkur&quot; were on good terms with the Ainu, and would send them deer, fish, and other game and exchange goods with them. The little people hated to be seen, however, so they would stealthily make their deliveries under the cover of night.

One day, a young Ainu man decided he wanted to see a &quot;korpokkur&quot; for himself, so he waited in ambush by the window where their gifts were usually left. When a &quot;korpokkur&quot; came to place something there, the young man grabbed it by the hand and dragged it inside. It turned out to be a beautiful &quot;korpokkur&quot; woman, who was so enraged at the young man&#x27;s rudeness that her people have not been seen since. Their pits, pottery, and stone implements, the Ainu believe, still remain scattered about the landscape.

== Anthropologic and folkloric discussions ==
Some anthropologists of the 19th and 20th centuries believed that the &quot;korpokkur&quot; were in fact a &quot;race that predated the Ainu&quot;. Arnold Henry Savage Landor proposed a theory about the indigenous people of Hokkaido, which suggested that the Ainu, migrating from the north, overtook and displaced an earlier population known as the Koro-pok-kuru. He believed the Koro-pok-kuru shared similarities with the Eskimo people and may have arrived in Yezo from the Aleutian Islands. Allen P. McCartney equated the Okhotsk culture with the &quot;Korpokkur&quot;. Early ethnographer Tsuboi Shogoro believed the Koropok-Guru legends pointed to a previous population that the Ainu displaced or even eradicated. These conclusions mostly come from misinterpretations of Hokkaido Jomon artifacts (such as pottery, tools, and arrowheads), which were understudied at the time and markedly different from what contemporaneous Ainu used.

Alexander Akulov refutes early anthropologists, stating that the pit-dwellings supposedly associated with the pre-Ainu aboriginal people were also built by the Ainu themselves in the Kurils and Sakhalin, an argument also used by John Batchelor. Based on the evidence presented, Akulov concludes that the Koropok-Guru legend is nothing more than a story. It does not signify a mysterious pre-Ainu race, but rather reflects a traditional Ainu dwelling practice that predates significant Japanese influence. He cites Pozdneyev, arguing that the legend &quot;was spread there where Ainu were already more or less japanized&quot;, quoting:Further northward the legend has terminated, in the northern Kuril Islands there nobody knows anything about it, and Ainu of Northern Kurils not only tell that the islands were not inhabited by someone else but insisted that they had lived in these islands since very deep antiquity. Being interrogated about the remains of the Stone Age they confidently responded that these remains belong to their ancestors.In his &quot;Ainu–Englis&quot;h&quot;–Japanese Dictionary,&quot; John Batchelor says that certain pit-dwellings associated with the &quot;korpokkur&quot; were called &quot;&quot;Koropok-un-guru koro chisei kot&quot; or &quot;Toi chisei kotcha utara kot chisei kot&quot;&quot;, respectively meaning &quot;sites belonging to people who dwelt below ground&quot; and &quot;house sites of people who had earth houses.&quot; He arguments that the original meaning of &quot;Koropok-guru&quot; was not &quot;people of the Petasites plant&quot; (&quot;Petasites&quot; being synonymous with butterbur), since &quot;Koropok&quot; can only be translated as “under, beneath, below.” The full name would be &quot;Koropok-un-guru&quot;, “people dwelling below,” &quot;un&quot; being a locative particle, which doesn&#x27;t carry the idea of dwarves or little people. He further argues that, even if &quot;Koropok-guru&quot; literally meant &quot;people under the Petasites&quot; plant, it wouldn&#x27;t imply dwarfish stature. Batchelor himself, standing nearly 5 ft. 8 in., could comfortably walk and even ride a pony amongst the Petasites leaves. He found it humorous to imagine how tall the people who named the pit-dwellers &quot;dwarves&quot; must have been if they considered movement beneath the plant indicative of short stature.

<text>Chester Arthur Burnett (June 10, 1910January 10, 1976), better known by his stage name Howlin&#x27; Wolf, was an American blues singer, guitarist and harmonica player. He was at the forefront of transforming acoustic Delta blues into electric Chicago blues, and over a four-decade career, recorded blues, rhythm and blues, rock and roll, and psychedelic rock. He is regarded as one of the most influential blues musicians of all time.

Born into poverty in Mississippi, Burnett became a protégé of Delta blues musician Charley Patton in the 1930s. In the Deep South, he began a solo career by performing with other notable blues musicians of the day. By the end of the decade, he had established himself in the Mississippi Delta. Following a number of legal issues, a stint in prison, and Army service, he was recruited by A&amp;R man Ike Turner to record for producer Sam Phillips in Memphis. His first record &quot;Moanin&#x27; at Midnight&quot; (1951) led to a record deal with Chess Records in Chicago. Between 1951 and 1969, six of his songs reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B charts. His studio albums include &quot;Howlin&#x27; Wolf&quot; a..k.a The Rocking Chair Album, a collection of singles from 1957 to 1961, &quot;The Howlin&#x27; Wolf Album&quot; (1969), &quot;Message to the Young&quot; (1971), &quot;The London Howlin&#x27; Wolf Sessions&quot; (1971), and &quot;The Back Door Wolf&quot; (1973). His reputation grew throughout the blues revival of the 1960s, and he continued to perform until November 1975, when he performed for the last time alongside fellow blues musician B.B. King. He died on January 10, 1976, after years of deteriorating health. In 1980, Howlin&#x27; Wolf was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, and in 1991, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

With a booming voice and an imposing physical presence, he is one of the best-known Chicago blues artists. AllMusic has described him as &quot;a primal, ferocious blues belter with a roster of classics rivaling anyone else, and a sandpaper growl of a voice that has been widely imitated&quot;. Several of his songs have become blues and blues rock standards. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame listed &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot;, &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot; and &quot;Spoonful&quot; in its &quot;500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot; and “Smokestack Lightning&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked him number 54 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.

==Early life==
Chester Arthur Burnett was born on June 10, 1910, in White Station, near West Point, Mississippi, to Gertrude Jones and Leon &quot;Dock&quot; Burnett. He later said that his father was &quot;Ethiopian&quot;, while Jones had Choctaw ancestry on her father&#x27;s side. He was named for Chester A. Arthur, the 21st President of the United States. The name &quot;Howlin&#x27; Wolf&quot; originated from Burnett&#x27;s maternal grandfather, John Jones; Burnett had been squeezing his grandmother&#x27;s chicks so hard he was likely to kill them, and his grandfather told him wolves would come and get him. The blues historian Paul Oliver wrote that Burnett once claimed to have been given his nickname by his idol Jimmie Rodgers.

Burnett&#x27;s parents separated when he was a year old. Dock, who had worked seasonally as a farm laborer in the Mississippi Delta, moved there permanently while Jones and Burnett moved to Monroe County. Jones and Burnett would sing together in the choir of the Life Boat Baptist Church near Gibson, Mississippi, and Burnett would later claim that he got his musical talent from her. Jones kicked Burnett out of the house, for unknown reasons, during the winter when he was a child. At the peak of his success, he returned from Chicago to see his mother in Mississippi and was driven to tears when she refused to take money offered by him, saying it was from his playing the &quot;devil&#x27;s music&quot;.

He moved in with his granduncle Will Young, who had a large household and treated him badly. While in the Young household he worked almost all day and did not receive an education at the school house. When he was thirteen, he killed one of Young&#x27;s hogs in a rage after the hog had caused him to ruin his dress clothes; this enraged Young who then whipped him while chasing him on a mule. He then ran away and claimed to have walked barefoot to join his father, where he finally found a happy home with his father&#x27;s large family. During this era he went by the name &quot;John D.&quot; to dissociate himself from his past, a name by which several of his relatives would know him for the rest of his life.

His physique garnered him the nicknames &quot;Big Foot Chester&quot; and &quot;Bull Cow&quot; as a young man: he was tall and weighed .

==Musical career==
===Beginnings, 1930s===
On January 15, 1928, at the age of 17, Burnett gathered enough money to buy his first guitar. It was a date that Burnett reportedly never forgot until &quot;the day he died&quot;.

In 1930, Burnett met Charley Patton, the most popular bluesman in the Mississippi Delta at the time. He would listen to Patton play nightly from outside a nearby juke joint. There he remembered Patton playing &quot;Pony Blues&quot;, &quot;High Water Everywhere&quot;, &quot;A Spoonful Blues&quot;, and &quot;Banty Rooster Blues&quot;. The two became acquainted, and soon Patton was teaching him guitar. Burnett recalled that &quot;the first piece I ever played in my life was... a tune about hook up my pony and saddle up my black mare&quot;—Patton&#x27;s &quot;Pony Blues&quot;. He also learned about showmanship from Patton: &quot;When he played his guitar, he would turn it over backwards and forwards, and throw it around over his shoulders, between his legs, throw it up in the sky&quot;. He played with Patton often in small Delta communities and would perform the guitar tricks he learned from him for the rest of his life. 

Burnett was influenced by other popular blues performers of the time, including the Mississippi Sheiks, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Ma Rainey, Lonnie Johnson, Tampa Red, Blind Blake, and Tommy Johnson. Two of the earliest songs he mastered were Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;Match Box Blues&quot; and Leroy Carr&#x27;s &quot;How Long, How Long Blues&quot;. The country singer Jimmie Rodgers was also an influence. Burnett tried to emulate Rodgers&#x27;s &quot;blue yodel&quot; but found that his efforts sounded more like a growl or a howl: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t do no yodelin&#x27;, so I turned to howlin&#x27;. And it&#x27;s done me just fine&quot;. His harmonica playing was modeled after that of Sonny Boy Williamson II, who taught him how to play when Burnett moved to Parkin, Arkansas, in 1933.

During the 1930s, Burnett performed in the South as a solo performer and with numerous blues musicians, including Floyd Jones, Johnny Shines, Honeyboy Edwards, Sonny Boy Williamson II, Robert Johnson, Robert Lockwood Jr., Willie Brown, Son House and Willie Johnson. By the end of the decade, he was a fixture in clubs, with a harmonica and an early electric guitar. It was around this time that Burnett got into some legal trouble in Hughes, Arkansas: While he was in town, he tried to protect a female acquaintance from an angry boyfriend, and the two men fought, with Burnett killing the man with a hoe. What happened after this is a matter of dispute; Burnett either fled the area, or did some jail time.

===Military service, 1940s===

On April 9, 1941, he was inducted into the U.S. Army and was stationed at several bases around the country. Years later, he stated that the plantation workers in the Delta had alerted military authorities because he refused to work in the fields. He was assigned to the 9th Cavalry Regiment, which was famous for being one of the units dubbed &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot;. Burnett was first sent to Pine Bluff, Arkansas, for basic training, and was given long hours performing menial work. Then he was transferred to Camp Blanding, in Starke, Florida, where he was assigned to the kitchen patrol. During the day he would cook food for the enlisted soldiers, and at night he would play the guitar in the assembly room. Burnett was later sent to Fort Gordon in Georgia, and he would play his guitar on the steps of the mess hall, which is where a young James Brown, who came to the Fort nearly every day to earn money shining shoes and performing buck dances for the troops, first heard him play.

Burnett was then sent to a tutoring camp in Tacoma, Washington, where he was in charge of decoding communications. Because Burnett was functionally illiterate, having never received formal education, he was repeatedly beaten by the drill instructor for reading and spelling errors. Soon, he began having uncontrollable shaking fits, dizzy spells, fainting, and also began experiencing mental confusion.

Burnett participated in the Louisiana Maneuvers in 1941, where one of the earliest photographs of him was taken cleaning the frog of a horse&#x27;s hoof. In 1943, he was evaluated at an Army mental hospital. In November 1943, Burnett was found unfit for duty and given an honorable discharge on November 3. Recalling his experiences in the Army years later, Burnett stated, &quot;The Army ain&#x27;t no place for a black man. Jus&#x27; couldn&#x27;t take all that bossin&#x27; around, I guess. The Wolf&#x27;s his own boss.&quot;

He returned to his family, which had recently moved near West Memphis, Arkansas, and helped with the farming while also performing, as he had done in the 1930s, with Floyd Jones and others. In 1948 he formed a band, which included the guitarists Willie Johnson and Matt &quot;Guitar&quot; Murphy, the harmonica player Junior Parker, a pianist remembered only as &quot;Destruction&quot; and the drummer Willie Steele. Radio station KWEM in West Memphis began broadcasting his live performances, and he occasionally sat in with Williamson on KFFA in Helena, Arkansas.

===First recordings and initial success, 1950s===
In 1951,19-year-old Ike Turner, who was a freelance talent scout, heard Howlin&#x27; Wolf in West Memphis. Turner brought him to record several songs for Sam Phillips at Memphis Recording Service (later renamed Sun Studio) and the Bihari brothers at Modern Records. Phillips praised his singing, saying, &quot;God, what it would be worth on film to see the fervour in that man&#x27;s face when he sang. His eyes would light up, you&#x27;d see the veins come out on his neck and, buddy, there was nothing on his mind but that song. He sang with his damn soul.&quot; Howlin&#x27; Wolf quickly became a local celebrity and began working with a band that included the guitarists Willie Johnson and Pat Hare. Sun Records had not yet been formed, so Phillips licensed his recording to Chess Records. Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s first singles were issued by two different record companies in 1951: &quot;Moanin&#x27; at Midnight&quot;/&quot;How Many More Years&quot; released on Chess, &quot;Riding in the Moonlight&quot;/&quot;Morning at Midnight,&quot; and &quot;Passing By Blues&quot;/&quot;Crying at Daybreak&quot; released on Modern&#x27;s subsidiary RPM Records. In December 1951, Leonard Chess was able to secure Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s contract, and at the urging of Chess, he relocated to Chicago in late 1952.

In Chicago, Howlin&#x27; Wolf assembled a new band and recruited the Chicagoan Jody Williams from Memphis Slim&#x27;s band as his first guitarist. Within a year he had persuaded the guitarist Hubert Sumlin to leave Memphis and join him in Chicago; Sumlin&#x27;s understated solos and surprisingly subtle phrasing perfectly complemented Burnett&#x27;s huge voice. The lineup of the band changed often over the years. Wolf employed many different guitarists, both on recordings and in live performance, including Willie Johnson, Jody Williams, Lee Cooper, L.D. McGhee, Otis &quot;Big Smokey&quot; Smothers, his brother Little Smokey Smothers, Jimmy Rogers, Freddie Robinson, Buddy Guy and others. He was able to attract some of the best musicians available because of his policy, unusual among bandleaders, of paying his musicians well and on time, even including their unemployment insurance and Social Security contributions. With the exception of a couple of brief absences in the late 1950s, Sumlin remained a member of the band for the rest of Wolf&#x27;s career and is the guitarist most often associated with the Howlin&#x27; Wolf sound.

Howlin&#x27; Wolf had a series of hits with songs written by Willie Dixon, who had been hired by the Chess brothers in 1950 as a songwriter. During that period, the competition between Muddy Waters and Howlin&#x27; Wolf was intense. Dixon reported &quot;Every once in a while Wolf would mention the fact that, &#x27;Hey man, you wrote that song for Muddy. How come you won&#x27;t write me one like that?&#x27; But when you&#x27;d write for him he wouldn&#x27;t like it.&quot; So, Dixon decided to use reverse psychology on him, by introducing the songs to Wolf as written for Muddy, thus getting Wolf to accept them.

In the 1950s, Howlin&#x27; Wolf had five songs on the &quot;Billboard&quot; national R&amp;B charts: &quot;Moanin&#x27; at Midnight&quot;, &quot;How Many More Years&quot;, &quot;Who Will Be Next&quot;, &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot;, and &quot;I Asked for Water (She Gave Me Gasoline)&quot;. His first LP, &quot;Moanin&#x27; in the Moonlight&quot;, was released in 1959. As was standard practice during that time, it was a collection of previously released singles.

===Album releases and European tours, 1960s and 1970s===
In the early 1960s, Howlin&#x27; Wolf recorded several songs that became his most famous, despite receiving no radio play: &quot;Wang Dang Doodle&quot;, &quot;Back Door Man&quot;, &quot;Spoonful&quot;, &quot;The Red Rooster&quot;, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Superstitious&quot;, &quot;Goin&#x27; Down Slow&quot;, and &quot;Killing Floor&quot;, many of which were written by Willie Dixon. Several became part of the repertoires of British and American rock groups, who further popularized them. Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s second compilation album, &quot;Howlin&#x27; Wolf&quot;—often called &quot;the rocking chair album&quot; from its cover illustration—was released in 1962.

During the blues revival in the 1950s and 1960s, black blues musicians found a new audience among white youths, and Howlin&#x27; Wolf was among the first to capitalize on it. He toured Europe in 1964 as part of the American Folk Blues Festival, produced by the German promoters Horst Lippmann and Fritz Rau. Also, in that year, the Rolling Stones recording of &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot; reached number one in the UK. In 1965, at the height of the British Invasion, the Stones came to America for an appearance on ABC-TV&#x27;s rock music show, &quot;Shindig!&quot;. They insisted, as part of their appearing on the program, that Howlin&#x27; Wolf would be their special guest. With the Stones sitting at his feet, Wolf performed an empassioned version of &quot;How Many More Years&quot; with a few million people watching his network TV debut. 

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Howlin&#x27; Wolf recorded albums with other established musicians starting with &quot;The Super Super Blues Band&quot; (1968), which featured Bo Diddley and Muddy Waters. &quot;The Howlin&#x27; Wolf Album&quot; (1969) had psychedelic rock and free-jazz musicians like Gene Barge, Pete Cosey, Roland Faulkner, Morris Jennings, Louis Satterfield, Charles Stepney and Phil Upchurch.&quot;The Howlin&#x27; Wolf Album&quot;, like rival bluesman Muddy Waters&#x27;s album &quot;Electric Mud&quot;, was designed to appeal to the hippie audience. The album had an attention-getting cover: large black letters on a white background proclaiming &quot;This is Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s new album. He doesn&#x27;t like it. He didn&#x27;t like his electric guitar at first either.&quot; The album cover may have contributed to its poor sales. Chess co-founder Leonard Chess admitted that the cover was a bad idea, saying, &quot;I guess negativity isn&#x27;t a good way to sell records. Who wants to hear that a musician doesn&#x27;t like his own music?&quot;

British rock musicians Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Ian Stewart, Bill Wyman, and Charlie Watts backed him for The London Howlin&#x27; Wolf Sessions, which proved more successful with British audiences than American. His last album&quot;The Back Door Wolf&quot; (1973) was entirely composed of new material. It was recorded with musicians who regularly backed him on stage, including Hubert Sumlin, Detroit Junior, Andrew &quot;Blueblood&quot; McMahon, Chico Chism, Lafayette &quot;Shorty&quot; Gilbert and the bandleader, Eddie Shaw. The album is shorter than any other he recorded, a little more than 35 minutes, because of his declining health.

Wolf&#x27;s last public performance was in November, 1975 at the International Amphitheatre in Chicago. He shared the bill with B.B. King, Albert King, Luther Allison, and O.V. Wright. Wolf reportedly gave an &quot;unforgettable&quot; performance, even crawling across the stage during the song, &quot;Crawling King Snake.&quot; The crowd gave him a five-minute standing ovation. When he got off the stage after the concert was over, a team of paramedics had to revive him.

== Artistry and legacy ==

=== Musical style ===
Wolf is among the most influential blues musicians of the postwar years. He was at the forefront of transforming the rural acoustic blues of the South, to the electric, more urban blues of Chicago. When Wolf first formed his band in West Memphis, Arkansas, his sound was much more aggressive, with guitarist Willie Johnson&#x27;s raucous, distorted guitar playing being the signature sound of his early recordings. When Wolf switched guitarists and added Hubert Sumlin to his lineup, his sound became less aggressive with Sumlin adding &quot;angular riffing&quot; and &quot;wild soloing&quot;. He also adopted the backbeat that Chicago blues was mainly known for.

The musician and critic Cub Koda noted, &quot;no one could match Howlin&#x27; Wolf for the singular ability to rock the house down to the foundation while simultaneously scaring its patrons out of its wits.&quot; Producer Sam Phillips recalled, &quot;When I heard Howlin&#x27; Wolf, I said, &#x27;This is for me. This is where the soul of man never dies. 

=== Equipment ===
Although Sumlin was the main guitar player in Wolf&#x27;s band, Wolf played a number of guitars himself throughout the years. He played a 1965 Epiphone Casino on his musical tour in Europe, a Fender Coronado, a Gibson Firebird V in the &quot;Down in the Bottom&quot; video recorded in 1966, a white Fender Stratocaster, a Teisco Tre-100, and he also played a Kay K-161 ThinTwin in his earlier years. The Kay K-161 ThinTwin is currently residing in the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio.

=== Accolades ===
In 1980, Burnett was posthumously inducted into the Blues Foundation&#x27;s Blues Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame as an early influence, and the Hall of Fame located in his hometown of West Point, Mississippi, in 1995.

On September 17, 1994, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 29 cent commemorative postage stamp depicting Howlin&#x27; Wolf.

On September 1, 2005, the Howlin&#x27; Wolf Blues Museum opened at 57 E. Westbrook Street in West Point, Mississippi. An annual festival is held there.

The Howlin&#x27; Wolf Foundation, a nonprofit corporation organized under the US tax code, section 501(c)(3), was established by Bettye Kelly to preserve and extend his legacy. The foundation&#x27;s mission and goals include preserving blues music, providing scholarships for students to participate in music programs, and support for blues musicians and blues programs.

The experimental rock band Swans performs a song titled &quot;Just A Little Boy (for Chester Burnett)&quot; on their 2014 album &quot;To Be Kind&quot;. The song takes heavy blues inspiration and features lead singer Michael Gira vocalizing in a manner similar to Burnett&#x27;s howling style.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Howlin&#x27; Wolf at number 59 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

==Personal life==
Burnett was noted for his disciplined approach to his personal finances. Having already achieved a measure of success in Memphis, he described himself as &quot;the onliest one to drive himself up from the Delta&quot; to Chicago, which he did, in his own car on the Blues Highway and with $4,000 in his pocket, a rare distinction for a black bluesman of the time. Although functionally illiterate into his forties, Burnett eventually returned to school, first to earn a General Educational Development (GED) diploma and later to study accounting and other business courses to help manage his career.

Burnett met his future wife, Lillie Handley (1925–2001), when she attended one of his performances at a Chicago club. She and her family were urban and educated and were not involved in what was considered the unsavory world of blues musicians. Nevertheless, he was attracted to her as soon as he saw her in the audience. He immediately pursued her and won her over. According to those who knew them, the couple remained deeply in love until his death. Together, they raised two daughters Betty and Barbara, Lillie&#x27;s daughters from an earlier relationship. West Coast rapper Skeme is his great nephew, who was born 14 years after his death.

After he married Lillie, who was able to manage his professional finances, he was so financially successful that he was able to offer band members not only a decent salary but benefits such as health insurance. This enabled him to hire his pick of available musicians and keep his band one of the best around. According to his stepdaughters, he was never financially extravagant (for instance, he drove a Pontiac station wagon rather than a more expensive, flashy car).

=== Health ===
Burnett&#x27;s health began declining in the late 1960s. He suffered his first heart attack in 1969 as he and Hubert Sumlin were traveling to a show at University of Chicago. He fell against the dashboard of the car he was riding in, and Sumlin, who was driving, pulled over and grabbed a two-by-four piece of wood that was lying in the road. Sumlin then rammed the wood into Burnett&#x27;s back, which kick-started his heart. Three weeks later, while he was in Toronto for a gig, Burnett suffered additional heart and kidney problems, but refused an operation recommended by doctors, telling his wife that &quot;he needed to keep working&quot;.

In 1970, Burnett was involved in a serious car accident that sent him flying through the windshield, which caused extensive damage to his kidneys. For the rest of his life, he received dialysis treatments every three days, which wife Lillie administered. In May that same year, while he was in the United Kingdom to record &quot;The London Howlin&#x27; Wolf Sessions&quot;, his health problems worsened. A year later, Burnett suffered another heart attack, and his kidneys had failed. He also began suffering from high blood pressure as well. By May 1973, Burnett was back performing again. The bandleader, Eddie Shaw, was so concerned for Burnett&#x27;s health that he limited him to performing six songs per concert.

==Death==
In January 1976, Burnett checked into the Edward Hines Jr. Veterans Administration Hospital in Hines, Illinois, for kidney surgery. Three days before his death, a carcinoma was found in his brain. He died from a combination of the tumor, heart failure, and kidney disease on January 10, 1976, at the age of 65. He was buried in Oakridge Cemetery, outside Chicago, in a plot in Section 18, on the east side of the road. His gravestone has an image of a guitar and harmonica etched into it.

==Awards and nominations==
In 1972, Howlin&#x27; Wolf was awarded an honorary doctor of arts degree from Columbia College in Chicago.

===Grammy Hall of Fame===
In 1999, Wolf&#x27;s recording of &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot; was selected for a Grammy Hall of Fame Award, an award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least 25 years old and have &quot;qualitative or historical significance&quot;.

===Rock and Roll Hall of Fame===
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame listed three songs by Howlin&#x27; Wolf in its &quot;500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;.

<doc id="166249" wikidata="Q1428015" url="?curid=166249" title="Concordat of 1801">
<text>The Concordat of 1801 was an agreement between the First French Republic and the Holy See, signed by First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte and Pope Pius VII on 15 July 1801 in Paris. It remained in effect until 1905, except in Alsace–Lorraine, where it remains in force. It sought national reconciliation between the French Revolution and Catholics and solidified the Roman Catholic Church as the majority church of France, with most of its civil status restored. This resolved the hostility of devout French Catholics against the revolutionary state. It did not restore the vast Church lands and endowments that had been seized during the Revolution and sold off. Catholic clergy returned from exile, or from hiding, and resumed their traditional positions in their traditional churches. Very few parishes continued to employ the priests who had accepted the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of the revolutionary regime. While the Concordat restored much power to the papacy, the balance of church-state relations tilted firmly in Bonaparte&#x27;s favour. He selected the bishops and supervised church finances.

Bonaparte and the Pope both found the Concordat useful. Similar arrangements were made with the Church in territories controlled by France, especially Italy and Germany.

==History==
During the Revolution, the National Assembly had taken Church properties and issued the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, which made the Church a department of the state, effectively removing it from papal authority. At the time, the nationalised Gallican Church was the official church of France, but it was essentially Catholicism. The Civil Constitution caused hostility among the Vendeans towards the change in the relationship between the Catholic Church and the French government. Subsequent laws abolished the traditional Gregorian calendar and Christian holidays.

The Concordat was drawn up by a commission with three representatives from each party. Napoleon Bonaparte, who was First Consul of the French Republic at the time, appointed Joseph Bonaparte, his brother, Emmanuel Crétet, a counselor of state, and Étienne-Alexandre Bernier, a doctor in theology. Pope Pius VII appointed Cardinal Ercole Consalvi, Cardinal Giuseppe Spina, archbishop of Corinth, and his theological adviser, Father Carlo Francesco Maria Caselli. The French bishops, whether still abroad or returned to their own country, had no part in the negotiations. The concordat as finally arranged practically ignored them.

While the Concordat restored some ties to the papacy, it was largely in favour of the state; it wielded greater power &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; the Pope than previous French regimes had, and church lands lost during the Revolution were not returned. Napoleon took a utilitarian approach to the role of religion. He could now win favour with French Catholics while also controlling Rome in a political sense. Napoleon once told his brother Lucien in April 1801, &quot;Skillful conquerors have not got entangled with priests. They can both contain them and use them.&quot; As a part of the Concordat, he presented another set of laws called the Organic Articles.

==Contents==
The main terms of the Concordat of 1801 between France and Pope Pius VII included:
* A declaration that &quot;Catholicism was the religion of the great majority of the French&quot; but not the official state religion, thus maintaining religious freedom, in particular with respect to Protestants.
* The Papacy had the right to depose bishops; the French government still, since the Concordat of Bologna in 1516, nominated them.
* The state would pay clerical salaries and the clergy swore an oath of allegiance to the state.
* The Catholic Church gave up all its claims to Church lands that were confiscated after 1790.
* Sunday was reestablished as a &quot;festival&quot;, effective Easter Sunday, 18 April 1802. The rest of the French Republican calendar, which had been abolished, was not replaced by the traditional Gregorian calendar until 1 January 1806.

According to Georges Goyau, the law known as &quot;The Organic Articles&quot;, promulgated in April 1802, infringed in various ways on the spirit of the concordat. The document claimed Catholicism was &quot;the religion of the majority of Frenchmen&quot;, and still gave state recognition to Protestants and Jews as well.

The Concordat was abrogated by the law of 1905 on the separation of church and state. However, some provisions of the Concordat are still in effect in the Alsace–Lorraine region under the local law of Alsace–Moselle, as the region was controlled by the German Empire at the time of the 1905 law&#x27;s passage.

<text>The Daniel Boone National Forest (originally the Cumberland National Forest) is a national forest in Kentucky, United States. Established in 1937, it includes of federally owned land within a proclamation boundary. The name of the forest was changed in 1966 in honor of the explorer Daniel Boone.

The terrain of the forest is generally rugged, and includes multiple prominent water features. It is home to a range of plant and animal species, although many areas still bear evidence of industrial logging and other practices which took place mostly prior to federal protection. It is a popular recreational and tourist destination which serves a million or more visitors a year, and contains several widely recognized areas which are protected in their own right, including state parks, trails, wilderness areas, and landmarks.

==Physical geography==
As of 2017 the Daniel Boone National Forest encompasses of federally owned land within a proclamation boundary. The land within the proclamation boundary contains both publicly and privately owned land, along with thousands of miles of marked boundary lines between the two. Most privately owned land, accounting for about is held by individuals and ranges from to in size.

The forest is formed by two main areas: a wide strip of land along the western edge of the Cumberland Plateau, and the Redbird Purchase, located on the east of the Cumberland Plateau. The terrain is generally rugged, hilly and mountainous, with reliefs of as much as in the north and toward the south. Administratively, the forest is divided into four ranger districts: Cumberland London, Redbird, and Stearns.

=== Counties ===
The Daniel Boone National Forest includes land across 21 Kentucky counties, namely:
# Bath County
# Clay County
# Estill County
# Harlan County
# Jackson County
# Knox County
# Laurel County
# Lee County
# Leslie County
# McCreary County
# Menifee County
# Morgan County
# Owsley County
# Perry County
# Powell County
# Pulaski County
# Rockcastle County
# Rowan County
# Wayne County
# Whitley County
# Wolfe County
===Water===

Major river systems include the Licking River, Kentucky River, and Cumberland River, all of which flow into the Ohio River. Four reservoirs are located within the forest, administered by the US Army Corps of Engineers. These are Cave Run Lake, Buckhorn Lake, Lake Cumberland and Laurel River Lake. Taken together, at normal water levels these reservoirs comprise of water. The forest additionally encompasses thousands of miles of smaller streams, many of which flow only after heavy rain. About are classified as riparian zones, while are classified as floodplains or wetlands.

Water is of an overall good quality, but is impacted by activities related to mining, and exploration for oil and gas. The area averages of rainfall annually, with thunderstorms occurring an average of 46 days per year. Due to shallow soil, heavy rains may result in severe local flooding, and conversely, many tributaries may become completely dry during periods of little rainfall.

===Air===
Air quality in the forest is considered &quot;excellent&quot;, due to the comparatively sparse population and lack of industry. The majority of air pollution results from the 128 average annual forest fires, in addition to controlled burning, the residential burning of coal, and dust from unpaved roads.

==History==
===European exploration until statehood===
By the early 16th century both the French and the British had laid claim to the land that would become the Daniel Boone National Forest. Among the first Europeans to enter the area was the French René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in 1669. He was later followed by the party of the English Thomas Walker in 1750, who would go on to make the first European discoveries of the Cumberland Gap, Cumberland River, and the pass through Pine Mountain Several others made expeditions in the area over the following decades with mixed success.

Around 1760, Daniel Boone reached an understanding with Richard Henderson for the exploration and preparation of the wilderness beyond the Appalachian Mountains, so that it may be more easily settled by those who sought to move westward. Boone made an expedition in 1767 into the area of modern-day Prestonsburg, Kentucky, and then in 1769, he set out with five others on an extended expedition through the Cumberland Gap and into Kentucky, where he stayed until March 1771. Boone set out on a failed attempt at settlement in 1773, and then again in 1774, where he served as an officer in Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War.

On March 17, 1775, the Transylvania Colony, founded by Henderson, and for which Boone was employed, reached an agreement (over the objections of the governors of Virginia and North Carolina) with a grand counsel of the Cherokee Nation to purchase all land from the Kentucky River to the Cumberland River, including large part of modern-day Kentucky and Tennessee, an area known as the Transylvania Purchase. In anticipation of this purchase, Boone and a party were dispatched on March 10, marking and clearing trails in the newly acquired lands, and eventually founding Fort Boone, near the confluence of Station Camp Creek and the Kentucky River. This became the fledgling Transylvania Colony, until being eliminated in 1778 by the Virginia House of Delegates, becoming Kentucky County, Virginia, and by 1792, the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

===Industrial use===
Up to the beginning of the 20th century, the Daniel Boone and surrounding forest were the subject of extensive logging, with logs sent downstream for processing in the sawmills of Louisville, Nashville, Frankfort and Cincinnati, only to be overtaken as rail extended into the area around the turn of the century. The industry reached its peak in 1907, with almost one billion board feet of lumber production. The forest was additionally harvested to provide charcoal for the developing iron industry, and as the railroad advanced, to produce crossties, and lumber for the building of bridges in addition to rail cars.

===Federal protection===

In 1900, Congress appropriated $5,000, and again in 1907, $25,000 for the investigation of areas in southern Appalachia, for potential purchase as a national forest. These efforts were further strengthened in 1911 by passage of the Weeks Act, which allocated millions in additional funding. As part of the Forest Service&#x27;s examination of the area, E. Murray Bruner published in 1914 an extensive report covering of land in Kentucky, and concluded in part:

Because of the general rugged topography of this section and very great influence it exerts upon navigation of the Kentucky River, it is very essential that its protection from extensive clearing be assured. For these reasons the section is eminently desirable as a purchase area, and therefore, in view of the fact that the prices of land now prevailing are very reasonable, there is a favorable prospect for making large purchases...

Land acquisition began in 1933, based largely on the purchase of from Stearns Coal and Lumber, acres from Castle Craig Coal, and from the Warfork Land Company. By the time the area was officially declared the Cumberland National Forest in 1937, the tract spanned of federally owned land across 16 Kentucky counties.

Both Daniel Boone and Henry Clay were originally put forth in the 1930s as potential namesakes. However, it was not until 1966, following, among other things, a resolution to the United States Department of Agriculture by the Kentucky Senate, that the name was officially changed by Lyndon B. Johnson to Daniel Boone National Forest on April 11. The same year, some of the Redbird Unit were added.

==Ecology==
The Daniel Boone National Forest contains around 40 commercial species of trees, and as many non-commercial species of trees and shrubs. These include mixed hardwoods such as oaks and hickories, in addition to white and yellow pine. Because much of the area was intensely logged prior to federal land protections, much of the forest is of low quality, although areas of younger growth is of a higher quality, having been always a part of protected lands. As of 1985, when the forest service published their environmental evaluation of the area, about 92% of the land was considered &quot;tentatively suitable&quot; for the production of timber.

The area is home to 54 species and subspecies of mammals, 194 of birds, 44 of reptiles, 41 of amphibians, and 150 of fish. Notable animals that inhabit this forest frequently seen by visitors include black bear, coyote, bobcat, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, gray squirrel, muskrat, quail, opossum, ruffed grouse, rabbit, red and gray fox species, raccoon and mourning dove. Other species present are the woodchuck, red-cockaded woodpecker, mink, bald eagle, Virginia big-eared bat, Indiana bat and gray bat. Venomous species include the copperhead, timber rattlesnake, and southern devil scorpion. Fish species include rainbow trout, large and smallmouth bass, bluegill, crappie, and muskie.

==Recreation==

The Daniel Boone National Forest provides a range of recreational activities, including approximately 100 developed recreation areas and of trails, that see more than a million visitors per year. Across the forest, developed recreation sites have a combined capacity to accommodate 15,830 visitors at-a-time, in addition to the capacity of dispersed recreational activities such as hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, boating and horse riding.

Within the forest&#x27;s boundaries lie three state managed parks, Buckhorn Lake, Cumberland Falls, and Natural Bridge. There is one designated National Recreation Area, the Big South Fork, located in the southwest corner of the forest, and one National Recreation Trail, the Sheltowee Trace, which stretches almost from northern Kentucky to Pickett CCC Memorial State Park near Jamestown, Tennessee. There are two designated wilderness areas, Beaver Creek, consisting of set aside in 1975, and Clifty Wilderness, consisting of near the Red River Gorge. The Red River Gorge itself is a designated National Natural Landmark, along with the Rock Creek Natural Research Area.

Hunting is also popular as a recreational activity. The Pioneer Weapons Wildlife Management Area, representing near Cave Run Lake, was created as a partnership between Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources and the US Forest Service, and is an area where hunters are permitted to use only comparatively primitive weapons, such muzzleloaders, bow and arrow, or crossbows.

<doc id="166254" wikidata="Q1056672" url="?curid=166254" title="Religion in Japan">
<text>Religion in Japan is manifested primarily in Shinto and in Buddhism, the two main faiths, which Japanese people often practice simultaneously. According to estimates, as many as 70% of the populace follow Shinto rituals to some degree, worshiping ancestors and spirits at domestic altars and public shrines. An almost equally high number is reported as Buddhist. Syncretic combinations of both, known generally as , are common; they represented Japan&#x27;s dominant religion before the rise of State Shinto in the 19th century.

The Japanese concept of religion differs significantly from that of Western culture. Spirituality and worship are highly eclectic; rites and practices, often associated with well-being and worldly benefits, are of primary concern, while doctrines and beliefs garner minor attention. Religious affiliation is an alien notion. Although the vast majority of Japanese citizens follow Shinto, only some 3% identify as Shinto in surveys, because the term is understood to imply membership of organized Shinto sects. Some identify as , yet this does not signify rejection or apathy towards faith. The is a specified identity, which is used mostly to affirm regular, &quot;normal&quot; religiosity while rejecting affiliation with distinct movements perceived as foreign or extreme.

==Main religions==

===Shinto===

, also , is the indigenous religion of Japan and of most of the people of Japan. George Williams classifies Shinto as an action-centered religion; it focuses on ritual practices to be carried out diligently in order to establish a connection between present-day Japan and its ancient roots. The written historical records of the and first recorded and codified Shinto practices in the 8th century. Still, these earliest Japanese writings do not refer to a unified &quot;Shinto religion&quot;, but rather to a collection of native beliefs and of mythology. Shinto in the 21st century is the religion of public shrines devoted to the worship of a multitude of gods (), suited to various purposes such as war memorials and harvest festivals, and applies as well to various sectarian organizations. Practitioners express their diverse beliefs through a standard language and practice, adopting a similar style in dress and ritual dating from around the time of the Nara (710–794) and Heian (794–1185) periods.The Japanese adopted the word &quot;Shinto&quot; (&quot;way of the gods&quot;), originally as &quot;Shindo&quot;, from the written Chinese (), combining two kanji: , meaning &quot;spirit&quot; or ; and , meaning a philosophical path or study (from the Chinese word ). The oldest recorded usage of the word dates from the second half of the 6th century. are defined in English as &quot;spirits&quot;, &quot;essences&quot; or &quot;gods&quot;, referring to the energy generating the phenomena. Since the Japanese language does not distinguish between singular and plural, refers to the divinity, or sacred essence, that manifests in multiple forms: rocks, trees, rivers, animals, places, and even people can be said to possess the nature of . and people are not separate; they exist within the same world and share its interrelated complexity.

Shinto is the largest religion in Japan, practiced by nearly 80% of the population, yet only a small percentage of these identify themselves as &quot;Shintoists&quot; in surveys. This is due to the fact that &quot;Shinto&quot; has different meanings in Japan: most of the Japanese attend Shinto shrines and beseech kami without belonging to Shinto organisations, and since there are no formal rituals to become a member of folk &quot;Shinto&quot;, &quot;Shinto membership&quot; is often estimated counting those who join organised Shinto sects. Shinto has 100,000 shrines and 78,890 priests in the country.

====Shinto sects and new religions====

Profound changes occurred in Japanese society in the 20th century (especially after World War II), including rapid industrialisation and urbanisation. Traditional religions, challenged by the transformation, underwent a reshaping themselves, and principles of religious freedom articulated by the 1947 constitution provided space for the proliferation of new religious movements.

New sects of Shinto, as well as movements claiming a thoroughly independent status, and also new forms of Buddhist lay societies, provided ways of aggregation for people uprooted from traditional families and village institutions. While traditional Shinto has a residential and hereditary basis, and a person participates in the worship activities devoted to the local tutelary deity or ancestor – occasionally asking for specific healing or blessing services or participating in pilgrimages – in the new religions individuals formed groups without regard to kinship or territorial origins, and such groups required a voluntary decision to join. These new religions also provided cohesion through a unified doctrine and practice shared by the nationwide community.

The officially recognized new religions number in the hundreds, and total membership reportedly numbers in the tens of millions. The largest new religion, Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist sect founded in 1930, gathers around 4 million members. Scholars in Japan have estimated that between 10% and 20% of the population belongs to the new religions, although more realistic estimates put the number at well below the 10% mark. there are 223,831 priests and leaders of the new religions in Japan, three times the number of traditional Shinto priests.

Many of these new religions derive from Shinto, retain the fundamental characters of Shinto, and often identify themselves as forms of Shinto. These include Tenrikyo, Konkokyo, Omotokyo, Shinrikyo, Shinreikyo, Sekai Shindokyo, Zenrinkyo and others. Others are independent new religions, including Aum Shinrikyo, Mahikari movements, the Church of Perfect Liberty, Seicho-no-Ie, the Church of World Messianity, and others.

===Buddhism===
 first arrived in Japan in the 6th century, introduced in the year 538 or 552 from the kingdom of Baekje in Korea. The Baekje king sent the Japanese emperor a picture of the Buddha and some sutras. After overcoming brief yet violent oppositions by conservative forces, it was accepted by the Japanese court in 587. The Yamato state ruled over centered around the worship of ancestral nature deities. It was also a period of intense immigration from Korea, horse riders from northeast Asia, as well as cultural influence from China, which had been unified under the Sui dynasty becoming the crucial power on the mainland. Buddhism functioned to affirm the state&#x27;s power and mold its position in the broader culture of East Asia. Japanese aristocrats set about building Buddhist temples in the capital at Nara. However, the government&#x27;s vast investment in spreading Buddhism during the Nara period (646-794) led to corruption, and led to reformation period and a shift in focus from Nara to the new capital of Heian (now Kyoto).The six Buddhist sects initially established in Nara are today together known as &quot;Nara Buddhism&quot; and are relatively small. When the capital moved to Heian, more forms of Buddhism arrived from China, including the still-popular Shingon Buddhism, an esoteric form of Buddhism similar to Tibet&#x27;s Vajrayana Buddhism, and Tendai, a monastic conservative form known better by its Chinese name, Tiantai.

When the shogunate took power in the 12th century and the administrative capital moved to Kamakura, more forms of Buddhism arrived. The most culturally influential was Zen, which focused on meditation and attaining enlightenment in this life. Two schools of Zen were established, Rinzai and Sōtō; a third, Ōbaku, formed in 1661.

With the Meiji Restoration in 1868 and its accompanying centralisation of imperial power and modernisation of the state, Shinto was made the state religion. An order of elimination of mutual influence of Shinto and Buddhism was also enacted, followed by a movement to thoroughly eradicate Buddhism from Japan.

Today, the most popular school in Japan is Pure Land Buddhism, which arrived in the form of independent schools in the Kamakura period, although elements of it were practiced in Japan for centuries beforehand. It emphasizes the role of Amitabha Buddha and promises that reciting the phrase will result in being taken by Amitabha upon death to the &quot;Western Paradise&quot; or &quot;Pure Land&quot;, where Buddhahood is more easily attained. Pure Land attracted members from all of the different classes, from farmers and merchants to noblemen and samurai clans, such as the Tokugawa clan. There are two primary branches of Pure Land Buddhism today: , which focuses on repeating the phrase many times as taught by Honen, and , which claims that only saying the phrase once with a pure heart is necessary, as taught by Shinran. Two smaller schools of Pure Land Buddhism exist as well, those of Ji-shu and Yuzu Nembutsu, although these are significantly smaller than their larger counterparts. 

Another prevalent form of Buddhism is Nichiren Buddhism, which was established by the 13th century monk Nichiren who underlined the importance of the Lotus Sutra. The main representatives of Nichiren Buddhism include sects such as and , and lay organisations like and —a denomination whose political wing forms the , Japan&#x27;s third largest political party. Common to most lineages of Nichiren Buddhism is the chanting of (or Nam Myoho Renge Kyo) and the inscribed by Nichiren.

, there were 355,000+ Buddhist monks, priests and leaders in Japan, an increase of over 40,000 compared to 2000.

== Minor religions ==
===Christianity===

In 2022, there were 1.9 million Christians in Japan, most of them living in the western part of the country, where missionaries&#x27; activities were greatest during the 16th century.

Christianity (キリスト教 &quot;Kirisutokyō&quot;), in the form of Catholicism (カトリック教 &quot;Katorikkukyō&quot;), was introduced into Japan by Jesuit missions starting in 1549. In that year, the three Jesuits Francis Xavier, Cosme de Torres and Juan Fernández, landed in Kagoshima, in Kyushu, on 15 August. Portuguese traders were active in Kagoshima since 1543, welcomed by local &quot;daimyōs&quot; because they imported gunpowder. Anjirō, a Japanese convert, helped the Jesuits understanding Japanese culture and translating the first Japanese catechism.

These missionaries were successful in converting large numbers of people in Kyushu, including peasants, former Buddhist monks, and members of the warrior class. In 1559, a mission to the capital, Kyoto, was started. By the following year there were nine churches, and the Christian community grew steadily in the 1560s. By 1569 there were 30,000 Christians and 40 churches. Following the conversion of some lords in Kyushu, mass baptisms of the local populations occurred, and in the 1570s the number of Christians rose rapidly to 100,000.

Near the end of the 16th century, Franciscan missionaries arrived in Kyoto, despite a ban issued by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. In 1597, Hideyoshi proclaimed a more serious edict and executed 26 Franciscans in Nagasaki as a warning. Tokugawa Ieyasu and his successors enforced the prohibition of Christianity with several further edicts, especially after the Shimabara Rebellion in the 1630s. Many Christians continued to practice in secret. However, more importantly, the discourses on Christianity became the property of the state during the Tokugawa period. The state leveraged its power over to declare Christians enemies of the state in order to create and maintain a legally enforceable identity for Japanese subjects. As such, Christian identities or icons became the exclusive property of the Japanese state. Although often discussed as a &quot;foreign&quot; or &quot;minority&quot; religion, Christianity has played a key sociopolitical role in the lives of Japanese subjects and citizens for hundreds of years.

In 1873, following the Meiji Restoration, the ban was rescinded, freedom of religion was promulgated, and Protestant missionaries (プロテスタント &quot;Purotesutanto&quot; or 新教 &quot;Shinkyō&quot;, &quot;renewed teaching&quot;) began to proselytise in Japan, intensifying their activities after World War II, yet they were never as successful as in Korea.

Nagasaki Prefecture had the highest percentage of Christians in 1996 (about 5.1%). As of 2007 there were 32,036 Christian priests and pastors in Japan. According to a poll conducted by the Gallup Organization in 2006, Christianity had increased significantly in Japan, particularly among youth, and a high number of teens were becoming Christians.

Throughout the latest century, some Western customs originally related to Christianity (including Western style weddings, Valentine&#x27;s Day and Christmas) have become popular among many of the Japanese. For example, 60–70% of weddings performed in Japan are Christian-style. Christianity and Christian culture has a generally positive image in Japan.

===Islam===

Islam (イスラム教 &quot;Isuramukyō&quot;) in Japan is mostly represented by small immigrant communities from other parts of Asia. In 2008, Keiko Sakurai estimated that 80–90% of the Muslims in Japan were foreign-born migrants primarily from Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Iran. It has been estimated that the Muslim immigrant population amounts to 10,000–50,000 people, while the &quot;estimated number of Japanese Muslims ranges from thousands to tens of thousands&quot;.

===Bahá&#x27;í Faith===
The Bahá&#x27;í Faith (バハーイー教 &quot;Bahāiikyō&quot;) in Japan began after a few mentions of the country by &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá first in 1875. The first Japanese convert was , who lived in Honolulu, and accepted the faith in 1902; the second convert was . The first Bahá&#x27;í convert on Japanese soil was in 1915. Almost a century later, the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 15,700 Bahá&#x27;ís in 2005.

===Judaism===
Judaism (ユダヤ教 &quot;Yudayakyō&quot;) in Japan is practiced by about 2,000 Jews living in the country. With the opening of Japan to the external world in 1853 and the end of Japan&#x27;s &quot;sakoku&quot; foreign policy, some Jews immigrated to Japan from abroad, with the first recorded Jewish settlers arriving at Yokohama in 1861. The Jewish population continued to grow into the 1950s, fueled by immigration from Europe and the Middle East, with Tokyo and Kobe forming the largest communities.

During World War II, some European Jews fleeing the Holocaust found refuge in Japan. These mainly Polish Jews received a so-called Curaçao visa from the Dutch consul in Kaunas, Jan Zwartendijk. This allowed one Japanese diplomat, Chiune Sugihara, the Japanese consul to Lithuania, to issue Japanese transit visa. In doing so, both Zwartendijk and Sugihara disregarded orders and helped more than 6,000 Jews escape the Nazis. After World War II, a large portion of Japan&#x27;s Jewish population emigrated, many going to what would become Israel. Some of those who remained married locals and were assimilated into Japanese society.

There are community centres serving Jews in Tokyo and Kobe. The Chabad-Lubavitch organization has two centers in Tokyo.

In September 2015, Japan nominated a Chief Rabbi for the first time, the head of Tokyo&#x27;s Chabad House, Rabbi Binyamin Edrei.

===Hinduism===
Hinduism (ヒンドゥー教 &quot;Hindūkyō&quot; or 印度教 &quot;Indokyō&quot;) in Japan is practiced by a small number of people, mostly migrants from China, India, Nepal, and Bali. Nevertheless, Hindu culture have had a significant but indirect role in Japanese culture, through the spread of Buddhism and the fascination of ancient world about Bharatvarsha. Four of the Japanese &quot;Seven Gods of Fortune&quot; originated as Hindu deities, including Benzaiten (Sarasvati), Bishamon (Vaiśravaṇa or Kubera), Daikoku (Mahakala/Shiva), and Kisshoutennyo (Laxmi). Various Hindu deities, including the aforementioned, are worshipped in Shingon Buddhism. This denomination and all other forms of Tantric Buddhism have multiple sources in common with Tantric Hinduism.

According to the Association of Religion Data Archives, there were 25,597 Hindus in Japan in 2020.

===Sikhism===

Sikhism (シク教 &quot;Sikukyō&quot;) is presently a minority religion in Japan mainly followed by families migrated from India. Sikh communities formed in the 1920s, primarily in Kobe and later in Tokyo. The Sikh population, though small, established gurdwaras. Notable figures include Maharaja Jagatjit Singh of Kapurthala who visited the country during 1903–1904.

===Jainism===

Jainism (ジャイナ教 &quot;Jainakyō&quot;) is a minority religion in Japan. , there were three Jain temples in the country. Minakata Kumagusu published the first simplified Japanese translation of Jainist concepts for common people.

===Other religions of East Asia===
Happy Science was founded in 1986 by Ryuho Okawa. This Japanese religion has been very active in its political ventures to re-militarize Japan.

====Ryukyuan religion====
The Ryukyuan religion is the indigenous belief system of the people of Okinawa and the other Ryukyu Islands. While specific legends and traditions may vary slightly from place to place and island to island, the Ryukyuan religion is generally characterized by ancestor worship (more accurately termed &quot;ancestor respect&quot;) and the respecting of relationships between the living, the dead, and the gods and spirits of the natural world. Some of its beliefs, such as those concerning &quot;genius loci&quot; spirits and many other beings classified between gods and humans, are indicative of its ancient animistic roots, as is its concern with , or life essence.

One of its most ancient features is the belief , the spiritual superiority of women derived from the goddess Amamikyu, which allowed for the development of a class of &quot;noro&quot; (priestesses) cult and &quot;yuta&quot; (female media). This differs from Japanese Shinto, where men are seen as the embodiment of purity. Ryukyuan religion has been influenced by Japanese Shinto and Buddhism, and various Chinese religions. It includes sects and reformed movements such as Ijun or Ijunism (Ryukyuan: いじゅん &quot;Ijun&quot;; Japanese: 違順教 &quot;Ijunkyō&quot;), founded in the 1970s.

====Ainu folk religion====

The Ainu religion is the indigenous belief system of the Ainu people of Hokkaido and parts of Far Eastern Russia. It is an animistic religion centered around the belief that &quot;Kamuy&quot; (spirits or gods) live in everything.

====Chinese folk religion====
Most Chinese people in Japan practice the Chinese folk religion (), also known as Shenism (), that is very similar to Japanese Shinto.

The Chinese folk religion consists in the worship of the ethnic Chinese gods and ancestors, &quot;shen&quot; (神 &quot;gods&quot;, &quot;spirits&quot;, &quot;awarenesses&quot;, &quot;consciousnesses&quot;, &quot;archetypes&quot;; literally &quot;expressions&quot;, the energies that generate things and make them thrive), which can be nature deities, city deities or tutelary deities of other human agglomerations, national deities, cultural heroes and demigods, ancestors and progenitors of kinships. Holy narratives regarding some of these gods are codified into the body of Chinese mythology.

====Taoism====
Taoism (道教 &quot;Dōkyō&quot;) was introduced from China between the 7th and 8th centuries, and influenced in varying degrees the Japanese indigenous spirituality. Taoist practices were absorbed into Shinto, and Taoism was the source of the esoteric and mystical religions of Onmyōdō, Shugendō and Kōshin.

Taoism, being an indigenous religion in China, shares some roots with Shinto, although Taoism is more hermetic while Shinto is more shamanic. Taoism&#x27;s influence in Japan has been less profound than that of Japanese Neo-Confucianism. Today, institutional Chinese Taoism is present in the country in the form of some temples; the &quot;Seitenkyū&quot; was founded in 1995.

====Confucianism====
Confucianism (儒教 &quot;Jukyō&quot;) was introduced from Korea during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598), and developed into an elite religion, yet having a profound influence on the fabric of Japanese society overall during the Edo period. The Confucian philosophy can be characterized as humanistic and rationalistic, with the belief that the universe could be understood through human reason, corresponding to the universal reason (&quot;li&quot;), and thus it is up to man to create a harmonious relationship between the universe (天 &quot;Ten&quot;) and the individual. The rationalism of Neo-Confucianism was in contrast to the mysticism of Zen Buddhism in Japan. Unlike the Buddhists, the Neo-Confucians believed that reality existed, and could be understood by mankind, even if the interpretations of reality were slightly different depending on the school of Neo-Confucianism.

The social aspects of the philosophy are hierarchical with a focus on filial piety. This created a Confucian social stratification in Edo society that previously had not existed, dividing Japanese society into four main classes: samurai, farmers, artisans and merchants. The samurai were especially avid readers and teachers of Confucian thought in Japan, establishing many Confucian academies.

Neo-Confucianism also introduced elements of ethnocentrism into Japan. As the Chinese and Korean Neo-Confucians had regarded their own culture as the center of the world, the Japanese Neo-Confucians developed a similar national pride. This national pride would later evolve into the philosophical school of Kokugaku, which would later challenge Neo-Confucianism, and its perceived foreign Chinese and Korean origins, as the dominant philosophy of Japan.

==Religious practices and holidays==
Most Japanese participate in rituals and customs derived from several religious traditions. Life cycle events are often marked by visits to a Shinto shrine and Buddhist temples. The birth of a new baby is celebrated with a formal shrine or temple visit at the age of about one month, as are the third, fifth, and seventh birthdays (&quot;Shichi-Go-San&quot;) and the official beginning of adulthood at age twenty (&quot;Seijin shiki&quot;). The vast majority of Japanese wedding ceremonies have been Christian for at least the last three and half decades. Shinto weddings and secular weddings that follow a &quot;western-style&quot; format are also popular but much less so and a small fraction (usually less than one percent) of weddings are Buddhist.

Japanese funerals are usually performed by Buddhist priests, and Buddhist rites are also common on death day anniversaries of deceased family members. 91% of Japanese funerals take place according to Buddhist traditions.

There are two categories of holidays in Japan: &quot;matsuri&quot; (temple fairs), which are largely of Shinto origin (some are Buddhist like Hanamatsuri) and relate to the cultivation of rice and the spiritual well-being of the local community; and &quot;nenjyū gyōji&quot; (annual feasts), which are largely of Chinese or Buddhist origin. During the Heian period, the &quot;matsuri&quot; were organized into a formal calendar, and other festivals were added. Very few &quot;matsuri&quot; or annual feasts are national holidays, but they are included in the national calendar of annual events. Most &quot;matsuri&quot; are local events and follow local traditions. They may be sponsored by schools, towns, or other groups but are most often associated with Shinto shrines.

Some of the holidays are secular in nature, but the two most significant for the majority of Japanese—New Year&#x27;s Day and &quot;Obon&quot;—involve visits to Shinto shrines or Buddhist temples and only Buddhist temples for later. The New Year&#x27;s holiday (January 1–3) is marked by the practice of numerous customs and the consumption of special foods. Visiting Shinto shrines or Buddhist temples to pray for family blessings in the coming year, dressing in a kimono, hanging special decorations, eating noodles on New Year&#x27;s Eve, and playing a poetry card game are among these practices. During Obon, &quot;bon&quot; (spirit altars) are set up in front of Buddhist family altars, which, along with ancestral graves, are cleaned in anticipation of the return of the spirits. People living away from their family homes return for visits with relatives. Celebrations include folk dancing and prayers at Buddhist temples as well as family rituals in the home.

==Religion and law==
In early Japanese history, the ruling class was responsible for performing propitiatory rituals, which later came to be identified as Shinto, and for the introduction and support of Buddhism. Later, religious organization was used by regimes for political purposes; for instance, the Tokugawa government required each family to be registered as a member of a Buddhist temple. In the early 19th century, the government required that each family belong to a shrine instead, and in the early 20th century, this was supplemented with the concept of a divine right to rule bestowed on the emperor. The Meiji Constitution reads: &quot;Japanese subjects shall, within limits not prejudicial to peace and order, and not antagonistic to their duties as subjects, enjoy freedom of religious belief&quot;.

Article 20 of the 1947 Constitution states: &quot;Freedom of religion is guaranteed to all. No religious organization shall receive any privileges from the State, nor exercise any political authority. No person shall be compelled to take part in any religious act, celebration, rite or practice. The State and its organs shall refrain from religious education or any other religious activity&quot;. This change in constitutional rights provided mechanisms for limiting state educational initiatives designed to promote Shinto beliefs in schools and freed the populace from mandatory participation in Shinto rites.

In postwar years, the issue of the separation of Shinto and state arose in the Self-Defense Force Apotheosis Case. In 1973, Nakaya Takafumi, a member of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces and husband of Nakaya Yasuko, died in a traffic accident. Despite Yasuko&#x27;s refusal to provide relevant documents for her husband&#x27;s enshrinement at the Yamaguchi prefectural National-Protecting Shrine, the prefectural Veterans’ Association requested the information from the Self-Defense Forces and completed the enshrinement. As a result, in 1973, Yasuko sued the Yamaguchi Prefectural Branch of the Self-Defense Forces, on the grounds that the ceremony of apotheosis violated her religious rights as a Christian.

Although Yasuko won the case at two lower courts, the ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court of Japan on June 1, 1988, based on the precedent established by the Tsu City Shinto Groundbreaking Ceremony Case. First, the Supreme Court ruled that because the Veterans’ Association—which was not an organ of the state—had acted alone when arranging the ceremony of apotheosis, no violation of Article 20 had occurred. Second, the Supreme Court held that the Self-Defense Forces&#x27; provision of Takafumi&#x27;s documents to the Veterans’ Association did not constitute a religious activity prohibited by Article 20, because neither the intention nor the effects of its action harmed or patronized any religion.

Third, the Supreme Court adopted a narrow interpretation of individual religious rights, by ruling that violation of individual rights to religion did not occur unless the state or its organs coerced individuals to perform some religious activity or limited their religious freedom. On June 2, 1988, a report by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the Japanese Supreme Court&#x27;s decision as “a major setback for advocates of stronger separation of religion and state in Japan.” On June 7, 1988, an article published in the &quot;New York Times&quot; expressed concern that the Japanese Supreme Court&#x27;s decision was likely to encourage the resurgence of State Shinto and nationalism. Because the prefectural National-Protecting Shrines perform the same ceremony of apotheosis as the Yasukuni Shrine does, the significance of this case also lies in its implications for the constitutionality of state patronage of and official visits to the Yasukuni Shrine.

==Opposition to organised religion==
In the early 1990s, Shichihei Yamamoto argued that Japan has shown greater tolerance towards irreligion than the West.
===Comments against religion by notable figures===
*Shin&#x27;ichi Hisamatsu, philosopher and scholar who rejected theism, claimed that God or Buddha, as objective beings, are mere illusions.
*Ito Hirobumi, four-time Prime Minister of Japan, who reportedly said: &quot;I regard religion itself as quite unnecessary for a nation&#x27;s life; science is far above superstition, and what is religion – Buddhism or Christianity – but superstition, and therefore a possible source of weakness to a nation? I do not regret the tendency to free thought and atheism, which is almost universal in Japan because I do not regard it as a source of danger to the community&quot;.
*Hiroyuki Kato, who headed the Imperial Academy from 1905 to 1909 and said: &quot;Religion depends on fear&quot;.
*Haruki Murakami, a Japanese novelist who wrote: &quot;God only exists in people’s minds. Especially in Japan, God&#x27;s always has been a kind of flexible concept. Look at what happened to the war. Douglas MacArthur ordered the divine emperor to quit being a God, and he did, making a speech saying he was just an ordinary person&quot;.
*Ando Shoeki, who denounced Confucian scholars and Buddhist clergy as spiritual oppressors of his age, though he still venerated the gods of old Japan as a pantheist would, equating them with nature.
*Fukuzawa Yukichi, who was regarded as one of the founders of modern Japan and found it impossible to combine modern learning with belief in gods, openly declaring: &quot;It goes without saying that the maintenance of peace and security in society requires a religion. For this purpose any religion will do. I lack a religious nature, and have never believed in any religion. I am thus open to the charge that I am advising others to be religious while I am not so. Yet my conscience does not permit me to clothe myself with religion when I have it not at heart...Of religions there are several kinds – Buddhism, Christianity, and what not. From my standpoint there is no more difference between those than between green tea and black...&quot;.

===Anti-religious organisations===
The Japan Militant Atheists Alliance (&quot;Nihon Sentoteki Mushinronsha Domei&quot;, also known as &quot;Senmu&quot;) was founded in September 1931 by a group of antireligious people. The alliance opposed the idea of kokutai, the nation&#x27;s founding myth, the presence of religion in public education, and the practice of State Shinto. Their greatest opposition was towards the imperial system of Japan.

Two months later, in November 1931, socialist Toshihiko Sakai and Communist Takatsu Seido created the Japan Anti-religion Alliance (&quot;Nihon Hanshukyo Domei&quot;). They opposed &quot;contributions to religious organizations, prayers for practical benefits (kito), preaching in factories, and the religious organizations of all stripes&quot; and viewed religion as a tool used by the upper class to suppress laborers and farmers.

==Demographics==
According to the annual statistical research on religion in 2015 by the Agency for Culture Affairs, Government of Japan, followers of Shintoism make up 70.4% of the total population, followers of Buddhism make up 69.8% of the population, followers of Christianity make up 1.5% of the population, and followers of other religions make up 6.9%. The Japanese National Character Survey of 2013 showed 72.0% of Japanese had no personal faith and the Japanese General Social Survey of 2015 showed 69.6% did not follow any religion.

According to surveys carried out in 2006 and 2008, less than 40% of the population of Japan identifies with an organized religion: around 35% are Buddhists, 3% to 4% are members of Shinto sects and derived religions, and from fewer than 1% to 2.3% are Christians.

<text>Elmore James ( Brooks; January 27, 1918 – May 24, 1963) was an American blues guitarist, singer, songwriter, and bandleader. Noted for his use of loud amplification and his stirring voice, James was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. His slide guitar technique earned him the nickname &quot;King of the Slide Guitar&quot;.

== Biography ==
Elmore James was born Elmore Brooks in Richland, Holmes County, Mississippi, the son of 15-year-old Leola Brooks, a field hand. His father was probably Joe Willie &quot;Frost&quot; James, who moved in with Leola, and Elmore took his surname. He began making music at the age of 12, using a simple one-string instrument (diddley bow, or jitterbug) strung on a shack wall. As a teen he performed at dances under the names Cleanhead and Joe Willie James.

James was influenced by Robert Johnson, Kokomo Arnold and Tampa Red. He recorded several of Tampa Red&#x27;s songs. He also inherited from Tampa Red&#x27;s band two musicians who joined his own backing band, the Broomdusters, &quot;Little&quot; Johnny Jones (piano) and Odie Payne (drums). In the late 1930s, James worked alongside Sonny Boy Williamson II.

During World War II, James joined the U.S. Navy, was promoted to coxswain and took part in the invasion of Guam. Upon his discharge, he returned to central Mississippi and settled in the town of Canton with his adopted brother, Robert Holston.

He began recording with Trumpet Records in nearby Jackson in January 1951, first as a sideman again for Sonny Boy Williamson II and for their mutual friend Willie Love and possibly others. He made his debut as a session leader in August that year recording a Robert Johnson composition, &quot;Dust My Broom&quot;, which was a surprise R&amp;B hit in 1952. His backing musicians became known as the Broomdusters.

James broke his contract with Trumpet Records to sign with the Bihari brothers through their scout Ike Turner, who played guitar and piano on a couple of his early Bihari recordings. His &quot;I Believe&quot; was a hit a year later. During the 1950s he recorded for the Bihari brothers&#x27; Flair Records, Meteor Records, and Modern Records; he also recorded for Chess Records and Mel London&#x27;s Chief Records. He played lead guitar on Big Joe Turner&#x27;s 1954 top 10 R&amp;B hit &quot;TV Mama&quot;.

In 1959, he began recording for Bobby Robinson&#x27;s Fire Records, which released &quot;The Sky Is Crying&quot;, &quot;My Bleeding Heart&quot;, &quot;Stranger Blues&quot;, &quot;Look on Yonder Wall&quot;, &quot;Done Somebody Wrong&quot;, and &quot;Shake Your Moneymaker&quot;, among others.

James died of a heart attack in Chicago in 1963, at the age of 45, as he was about to tour Europe with that year&#x27;s American Folk Blues Festival. He was buried in the Newport Baptist Church Cemetery, in Ebenezer, Mississippi. Phil Walden of Capricorn Records raised funds for a granite headstone for James&#x27;s grave. The headstone which reads &quot;King of the Slide Guitar&quot;, features a bronze relief of James playing guitar. It was revealed at a dedication ceremony sponsored by the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund in 1992.

James was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 as an &quot;Early Influence&quot; inductee. He had been inducted in the Blues Hall of Fame within its initial list of inductions in 1980. In 2012, he was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in Ebenezer.

== Influence ==
James influenced many slide players, such as blues guitarists Homesick James, Hound Dog Taylor, and J. B. Hutto. His single string playing also influenced B.B. King and Chuck Berry. Rock guitarists Jimi Hendrix, Duane Allman, Brian Jones, Jeremy Spencer, and Frank Zappa have acknowledged his influence. In the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;For You Blue&quot;, John Lennon plays a slide solo on a Höfner lap steel guitar; George Harrison encourages him with &quot;Go, Johnny, go... Elmore James got nothin&#x27; on this, baby&quot;.

<doc id="166258" wikidata="Q2063057" url="?curid=166258" title="V Corps (United States)">
<text>V Corps (), formerly known as the Fifth Corps, is a regular corps of the United States Army headquartered at Fort Knox, Kentucky and Camp Kościuszko, Poland.

It previously served during World War I, World War II, the Cold War, Kosovo War, and the War on Terrorism.

==Shoulder sleeve insignia==
The corps&#x27;s shoulder patch, a pentagon whose points lie on an imaginary circle in diameter whose edges are white lines in width and whose radial lines are white in width, was approved on 3 December 1918. The triangles thus outlined in white are flag blue. The pentagon represents the number of the Corps, while blue and white are the colors associated with Corps flags.

==History==
===World War I===
V Corps was organized 7–12 July 1918 in the Regular Army in France, as part of the American Expeditionary Forces. By the end of World War I, the Corps had fought in three named campaigns.

===Interwar period===

The V Corps was constituted in the Organized Reserve on 29 July 1921, allotted to the Fifth Corps Area, and assigned to the Second Army. The corps headquarters was activated on 17 February 1922 at Fort Thomas, Kentucky, with Regular Army and Organized Reserve personnel. The Headquarters Company was allotted to the Ohio National Guard, but was placed on the &quot;Deferred National Guard&quot; list on 2 July 1923 and allotted to the Organized Reserve.

The Headquarters Company was initiated late 1924 with Reserve personnel at Columbus, Ohio. The corps headquarters was responsible for providing and planning administration, organization, supply, and training for army, corps, and other non-divisional Reserve units, less field and coast artillery, in the Fifth Corps Area. The headquarters was relieved from active duty on 15 November 1924, and all Regular Army personnel were reassigned to the Headquarters, Non-Divisional Group, Fifth Corps Area, which assumed the responsibilities previously held by the V Corps. Both the Headquarters and Headquarters Company remained active in the Organized Reserve. The corps headquarters was relocated in late 1924 to Indianapolis, Indiana, where most of the Reserve personnel assigned to the unit were located. Headquarters, V Corps was withdrawn from the Organized Reserve on 15 August 1927 and allotted to the Regular Army; Headquarters Company, V Corps was withdrawn from the Deferred National Guard list on 15 September 1927 and permanently allotted to the Organized Reserve.

The headquarters company was further withdrawn from the Organized Reserve on 1 October 1933 and allotted to the Regular Army. At the same time, the corps headquarters was partially activated at Fort Hayes, Ohio, with Regular Army personnel from the headquarters, Fifth Corps Area, and Organized Reserve personnel from the corps area at large. Though a &quot;Regular Army Inactive&quot; unit from 1927 to 1940, the corps headquarters was organized provisionally for short periods using its assigned Reserve officers and staff officers from Headquarters, Fifth Corps Area. These periods of provisional active duty were generally for command post exercises and major maneuvers. Headquarters, V Corps was fully activated on 20 October 1940, less Reserve personnel, at Camp Beauregard, LA.

===World War II===
After Nazi Germany declared war on the United States on 11 December 1941, the corps deployed (January 1942) the first American soldiers to the European Theater of Operations, United States Army. That initial deployment was known as the U.S. Army Northern Ireland Force or MAGNET. On 6 June 1944, V Corps assaulted Omaha Beach, Normandy. Corps soldiers then broke out from the beachhead, liberated Paris and Sedan, Ardennes, and raced to the German border. After liberating Luxembourg City, V Corps fought in the Battle of the Bulge, captured Leipzig, made first contact with the Red Army at Torgau, and, south in Czechoslovakia, liberated Plzeň by May 1945.

===Cold War===

In March 1947, United States European Command directed that its combat forces were to convert to &quot;Occupation duties.&quot; On 1 December 1950, due to concern of a Soviet threat to Western Europe during the Korean War, Seventh Army was activated as a field army in Europe. Seventh Army absorbed the two main Occupation Duty forces then in Germany, namely the 1st Infantry Division and the United States Constabulary.

By middle 1948 limited combat training had been restored within the European Command.

In December, 1950 President Truman declared a National Emergency due to the Korean War, and four divisions were dispatched to reinforce U.S. forces in Europe, including the National Guard&#x27;s 28th and 43rd Infantry Divisions. In May 1951 the 4th Infantry Division arrived in United States Army Europe (USAREUR) in Germany, and on 3 August 1951, V Corps was reactivated and assigned to the Seventh Army in USAREUR. In July the 2d Armored Division arrived in Germany, and on 25 August 1951 the 4th Infantry Division (HQ: Frankfurt) and 2d Armored Division (HQ: Bad Kreuznach) were assigned as V Corps divisions.

The Constabulary was inactivated upon the arrival of the four U.S. division augmentation forces to Germany. V Corps was assigned to the northern area of the U.S. Occupation Zone of Germany (which included the Fulda Gap), and the VII Corps was assigned to the southern area of the U.S. Zone (one of the National Guard divisions (the 43rd) was stationed in the Munich area, and the other (the 28th) was between Munich and Stuttgart). Several years later the newly forming West German Army displaced the GDP positions of some of the U.S. units stationed in the far southern area of West Germany. As a consequence, the U.S. units&#x27; GDP positions were moved further north, as was the U.S. VII Corps&#x27; wartime southern boundary line (even though the U.S. units remained in their original kasernes). This shifting action likely coincided with the same time frame as the Summer and Fall conversion of all Seventh Army units to the ROAD organization.

Although, as referenced above, in 1951 the 1st Infantry Division was assigned to the newly activated VII Corps, the significance of the V Corps assigned Fulda Gap and Meiningen Gap (AKA Grabfeld Gap) defense influenced not only the reassignment of the Wuerzburg-headquartered 1st Infantry Division to V Corps on 2 February 1952, but also the 1 October 1953 assignment of the newly formed 19th Armor Group, headquartered at Frankfurt, to V Corps.

As of June 1954, the main unit assignments to V Corps were 1st Infantry Division, 4th Infantry Division, 2d Armored Division, and 19th Armor Group (19th AG was the size of a large brigade, with 3 tank battalions and one mech. infantry battalion stationed from Mannheim to Wildflecken). The first U.S. armored division to be stationed east of the Rhine River in the Cold War, namely V Corps&#x27; 3d Armored Division, arrived in May/June 1956. (The 3d Armored Div. replaced the 4th Infantry Div.; later, the 2d Armored Div. was replaced by the Bad Kreuznach arriving 8th Infantry Div.) The 19th Armor Group (HQ Frankfurt) was replaced by the 4th Armor Group on 1 July 1955 (the 4th AG was approximately the size of the replaced 19th AG); the 4th Armor Group was deactivated in the 1963 ROAD conversion. In 1955 the 1st Infantry Division gyroscoped to CONUS, and was replaced in V Corps by the 10th Infantry Division from CONUS. In 1958 the 3rd Infantry Division gyroscoped from CONUS and the 10th Infantry Division gyroscoped to CONUS.

Due to the 1963 ROAD reorganization in USAREUR, V Corps ultimately lost two assigned units:
(1) the 4th Armor Group was inactivated;
(2) the 3rd Infantry Division, with its headquarters at Wuerzburg, was reassigned to VII Corps.

After the Cold War collapse of the Warsaw Pact, V Corps soldiers deployed both units and individuals to Saudi Arabia for the Gulf War; and to other operations in Kuwait, northern Iraq, Croatia, Somalia, Republic of Macedonia, Rwanda, and Zaire.

==== Organization 1989 ====


At the end of the Cold War in 1989 V Corps consisted of the following units:

* V Corps, Frankfurt, West Germany
** 3rd Armored Division, Frankfurt
** 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized), Fort Carson, Colorado (Operation Reforger unit)
** 8th Infantry Division (Mechanized), Bad Kreuznach
** V Corps Artillery, Frankfurt
*** 41st Field Artillery Brigade, Babenhausen
*** 42nd Field Artillery Brigade, Giessen
** 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, Fulda
** 194th Armored Brigade, Fort Knox, Kentucky (Operation Reforger unit)
** 197th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized), Fort Benning, Georgia (Operation Reforger unit)
** 12th Aviation Brigade, Wiesbaden
** 130th Engineer Brigade, Hanau
** 18th Military Police Brigade, Frankfurt
** 22nd Signal Brigade (Corps), Frankfurt
** 205th Military Intelligence Brigade, Frankfurt
** 3rd Corps Support Command, Wiesbaden

===1990s===

In December 1994, as part of the realignment of United States Armed Forces, V Corps moved from the IG Farben Building to Campbell Barracks in Heidelberg, severing a forty-three-year tie with Frankfurt. The corps reached out to the armed forces of eastern Europe with numerous initiatives to foster closer ties and better understanding. Maintaining the NATO commitment, V Corps in 1994 created two bi-national corps with Germany. For Command Component Land Heidelberg missions, the corps commanded the 13th (German) Armored Infantry Division, while II (German) Corps commanded the 1st Armored Division. 

In December 1995, V Corps deployed 1st Armored Division and elements of six separate brigades for the Implementation Force (IFOR). The corps headquarters and Headquarters Company, the 3d Support Command, and the separate brigades helped form the National Support Element headquartered in Hungary for United States Armed Forces in Bosnia. Brigades of the two divisions rotated in the peace enforcement mission for a number of years in Bosnia. Headquarters and Headquarters Company, V Corps, was decorated with the Army Superior Unit Award in 1998 in recognition of the unit&#x27;s performance in Implementation Force (IFOR). In April 1999, V Corps deployed the headquarters and subordinate units to Albania as Task Force Hawk, a force involved in the ongoing crisis in Kosovo. The 1st Infantry Division served in Kosovo twice and the 1st Armored Division served once, in addition to V Corps separate brigades.

===War on Terrorism===

At the end of 2002, V Corps deployed to Kuwait under United States Central Command for the Iraq War. The United States-led coalition brought about a regime change in Iraq and satisfied international concerns about Iraq and weapons of mass destruction. The corps and its maneuver brigades crossed into Iraq on 21 March 2003 as the main effort. In sixteen days of fighting, V Corps advanced more than 540 miles straight-line distance from Kuwait to Baghdad, decisively defeated the Iraqi Armed Forces, and toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein.

On 15 June 2003, the corps formed Combined Joint Task Force 7, based in Baghdad, and continued military operations to pacify the remainder of Iraq, rebuild the country, and create democratic institutions. As part of Combined Joint Task Force 7 mission, V Corps soldiers sought out and arrested or killed the major figures in the previous Iraqi regime, culminating in the arrest of Saddam Hussein himself. On 1 February 2004, V Corps was succeeded in Combined Joint Task Force 7 by III Corps and redeployed to its home station in Heidelberg, Germany. In recognition of its combat achievements in Iraq, the Department of the Army, in 2004, awarded the Headquarters and Headquarters Company the Meritorious Unit Commendation (Army).

In January 2006, the corps, deployed to Iraq and replaced XVIII Airborne Corps as the command and control element for Multi-National Corps–Iraq. During its second year-long deployment, which ended on 14 December 2006, V Corps continued to lead coalition forces and made great strides battling a widespread insurgency, and conducting a massive rebuilding effort.

From 2012 to 2013, V Corps served in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, providing command and control of all U.S. ground forces stationed there. On 16 February 2012, it was announced that Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, V Corps would inactivate upon redeployment from Afghanistan per guidance issued by the Department of the Army earlier that same year. On 12 June 2013, V Corps was awarded an Army Superior Unit Award, a Meritorious Unit Commendation, then ceremonially inactivated at Biebrich Palace, Wiesbaden, Germany.

=== Reactivation ===
On 11 February 2020, the United States Department of the Army announced the activation of corps headquarters (V Corps). V Corps Headquarters will have approximately 635 soldiers, with approximately 200 who will support an operational command post in Europe. The Corps Headquarters is projected to be operational by autumn 2020.

On 12 February 2020, the Army announced that V Corps&#x27; new headquarters would be located at Fort Knox, Kentucky.

United States Army Chief of Staff, General James McConville stated:

The activation of an additional Corps headquarters provides the needed level of command and control focused on synchronizing U.S. Army, allied, and partner nation tactical formations operating in Europe. It will enhance U.S. Army Europe and U.S. European Command as they work alongside allies and partners to promote regional stability and security.

The establishment of V Corps supports United States European Command&#x27;s request for increased command and control capability.

In May 2020, MG John Kolasheski, commanding general of the 1st Infantry Division was nominated to command the newly reactivated V Corps. Once confirmed by the Senate he would receive a third star. Kolasheski was confirmed to the rank of lieutenant general on 21 May 2020. He was promoted by Army Chief of Staff James C. McConville on 4 August 2020 in Kraków, Poland. McConville announced that V Corps forward headquarters would be established in Poland after the next fiscal year started on 1 October 2020. Two hundred of the expected 630 headquarters staff members would be stationed in Poznań on a rotational basis.


The forward headquarters will &quot;conduct operational planning, mission command and oversight of the rotational forces in Europe&quot;, and work alongside allies and partners to build readiness and enhance interoperability.

On 21 July 2021 MG Jeffery Broadwater was announced as DCG, V Corps. (In May 2021, MG Matthew Van Wagenen was appointed as DCG-Manoeuvre to be based in Poznan, Poland, but who presently serves as a DCG for the Army component of SHAPE.)

On 7 March 2022 a V Corps headquarters element deployed to Germany, joining the forward element already in Europe, to &quot;provide additional command and control of U.S. Army forces in Europe.&quot; The headquarters is also tasked to &quot;provide a more robust presence in Europe and enable the Corps to synchronize current contingency operations, support the ongoing mission to reinforce NATO’s eastern flank and coordinate multinational exercises across the continent.&quot; This deployment is in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

At the 29 June 2022 NATO summit in Madrid US President Joe Biden announced that a permanent military base would be established in Poland that would serve as the new headquarters of V Corps and &quot;strengthen the US-NATO interoperability across the entire eastern flank,&quot; in further response to the Russian campaign in Ukraine. On 30 July 2022 the headquarters of V Corps (Forward) in Poznań was renamed Camp Kosciuszko.

On 13 to 15 December 2023 V Corps and the Polish Armed Forces General Command co-hosted their first Warfighting Symposium, in Warsaw. The symposium included briefings on training, technical interoperability, operational development, scenario-based practical exercises, and intelligence assessments.

* The Athens Unit is located in Athens, Hocking, Morgan, Perry, and Vinton Counties, and includes 67,224 acres (272 km²) as of 2002. It features the Wildcat Hollow Trail, a hiking trail just northeast of Burr Oak State Park in Morgan County; the Stone Church Horse Trail in Perry County; the Utah Ridge Recreation Area in Athens County, and the Dorr Run ATV Trails in Hocking County.
* The Marietta Unit is located in Monroe, Noble, and Washington Counties, and includes 63,381 acres (256 km²) as of 2002, with over half of the total being within Washington County.
* The Ironton Unit is located in Gallia, Jackson, Lawrence, and Scioto Counties, and includes 99,049 acres (401 km²) as of 2002, with over two-thirds of the total being within Lawrence County.

The North Country Trail passes through several areas of Wayne, in which it is coincident with the Buckeye Trail and the American Discovery Trail. The area of Ohio included within the national forest is based on late Paleozoic geology, heavy in sandstones and shales, including redbeds, with many coal beds. The topography is typically very rugged, with elevation changes typically in the 200–400-foot range. 

== History ==
The land on which the forest exists and grows was consigned to the United States by the Northwestern Confederacy in 1795 as part of the Treaty of Greenville; it is in the State of Ohio which was named for an indigenous word translating to &quot;Good River.&quot;

During the late 18th and 19th century, the forested land was cleared for agricultural and lumbering use, but years of poor timbering and agricultural practices led to severe erosion and poor soil composition. The Wayne National Forest was started as part of a reforestation program. It was established as a National Forest for the public in December 1992.

In 2022, approximately of the forest were burned by fires that were deliberately set by a former fire department administrator and police officer. In 2025, the culprit was sentenced to 18 months in prison and required to pay $368,000 in restitution.

On April 4, 2024, the Biden Administration proposed that fracking be permitted in the forest, a plan which drew widespread criticism. The administration&#x27;s Bureau of Land Management announced it would open of the Wayne to fracking for oil and gas. The new proposal, released in late March 2024, is nearly identical to the fracking plan that was blocked in 2020 by a federal judge after conservation groups had challenged it in federal court.

On May 23, 2024, The Wayne National Forest planted a Moon Tree sapling at its Forest Headquarters building in Nelsonville, Ohio, as part of an initiative between NASA and the U.S. Forest Service. The sweetgum sapling was one of fewer than 1,500 seedlings flown thousands of miles beyond the moon aboard the unmanned Orion spacecraft, spending six weeks in space during NASA’s Artemis I mission that had launched on November 16, 2022.

== Proposed renaming ==
On August 21, 2023, the U.S. Forest Service proposed changing the forest&#x27;s name to &quot;Buckeye National Forest&quot; after considering other names that included &quot;Ohio National Forest&quot; (its first unofficial name) and &quot;Koteewa National Forest&quot; (Shawnee word for Buckeye). Some supporters of changing the name, including the City Council of Athens in an official letter dated September 5, 2023, prefer &quot;Ohio National Forest,&quot; or &quot;Pawpaw National Forest&quot; for the official state native fruit, to be chosen instead of &quot;Buckeye National Forest.&quot; The change, if adopted by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack of Iowa, would cost $400,000 to implement. The call to change the name was initiated primarily by American Indian tribes who objected to its namesake of Anthony Wayne. Opposition to changing the name centers on preserving Wayne&#x27;s impact to Ohio, critiques of pop history (citing Wayne&#x27;s complexity), and the violence caused by both tribes and settlers.

<doc id="166271" wikidata="Q1208167" url="?curid=166271" title="Ryukyuans">
<text>The are a Japonic-speaking East Asian ethnic group indigenous to the Ryukyu Islands, which stretch from the island of Kyushu to the island of Taiwan. Administratively, most Ryukyuans live in either Okinawa Prefecture or Kagoshima Prefecture within Japan. They speak the Ryukyuan languages, considered to be one of the two branches of the Japonic language family, the other being Japanese and its dialects (Hachijō is sometimes considered by linguists to constitute a third branch).

Ryukyuans are not a recognized minority group in Japan, as Japanese authorities consider them a subgroup of the Japanese people, akin to the Yamato people. Although officially unrecognized, Ryukyuans constitute the largest ethnolinguistic minority group in Japan, with more than 1.4 million living in the Okinawa Prefecture alone. Ryukyuans inhabit the Amami Islands of Kagoshima Prefecture as well, and have contributed to a considerable Ryukyuan diaspora.

Ryukyuans have a distinct culture with some matriarchal elements, indigenous religion and cuisine which had a fairly late (12th century) introduction of rice. The population lived on the islands in isolation for many centuries. In the 14th century, three separate Okinawan political polities merged into the Ryukyu Kingdom (1429–1872), which continued the maritime trade and tributary relations started in 1372 with Ming China. In 1609, the Satsuma Domain (based in Kyushu) invaded the Ryukyu Kingdom. The Kingdom maintained a fictive independence in vassal status, in a dual subordinate status to both China and Japan, because Tokugawa Japan was prohibited to trade (directly) with China.

During the Japanese Meiji era, the kingdom became the Ryukyu Domain (1872–1879), politically annexed by the Empire of Japan. In 1879, the Ryukyu Domain was abolished, and the territory was reorganized as Okinawa Prefecture, with the last king (Shō Tai) forcibly exiled to Tokyo. China renounced its claims to the islands in 1895. During this period, the Meiji government, which sought to assimilate the Ryukyuans as Japanese (Yamato), suppressed Ryukyuan ethnic identity, tradition, culture, and language. After World War II, the Ryūkyū Islands were occupied by the United States between 1945 and 1950 and then from 1950 to 1972. Since the end of World War II, many Ryukyuans have expressed strong resentment against the extensive U.S. military facilities stationed in Okinawa and Tokyo&#x27;s handling of related issues.

United Nations special rapporteur on discrimination and racism Doudou Diène, in his 2006 report, noted a perceptible level of discrimination and xenophobia against the Ryukyuans, with the most serious discrimination they endure linked to their opposition of American military installations in the archipelago.

==Etymology==
In English, they are also known as Okinawans or Lewchewans.

Their usual ethnic name derives from the Chinese name for the islands, (also spelled as Loo Choo, Lew Chew, Luchu, and more), which in the Japanese language is pronounced . In the Okinawan language, it is pronounced . In their indigenous language they often call themselves and their identity as Uchinānchu. Another endonym is Shimanchu (). These terms are rarely used outside of the ethnic community, and are politicized markers of a distinct culture.

&quot;Ryukyu&quot; is an other name from the Chinese side, and &quot;Okinawa&quot; is a Japanese cognate of Okinawa&#x27;s indigenous name &quot;Uchinā&quot;, originating from the residents of the main island referring to the main island against the surrounding islands, Miyako and Yaeyama. Mainland Japanese adapted Okinawa as the way to call these people.

==Origins==

===Genetic studies===
According to the recent genetic studies, the Ryukyuans share more alleles with the southern Jōmon (16,000–3,000 years ago) hunter-gatherers than the Yayoi people, who had rice farming culture, have smaller genetic contributions from Asian continental populations, which supports the dual-structure model of K. Hanihara (1991), a widely accepted theory which suggests that the Yamato Japanese are more admixed with Asian agricultural continental people (from the Korean Peninsula) than the Ainu and the Ryukyuans, with major admixture occurring in and after the Yayoi period (3,000–1,700 years ago).&lt;ref name=&quot;DOI 10.1038/jhg.2016.110&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Japanese population the Ryukyu make a separate and one of the two genome-wide clusters along the main-island Honshu. The Jōmon ancestry is estimated at approximately 28%, with recent studies estimating it at ~36% and 26.1%. Ryukyuans share continental ancestors (i.e., Northeast Asian and East Asian) with the Yamato Japanese. These continental components were not directly introduced from the continent but by immigrants from the main islands of Japan, who already possessed the tripartite ancestor. This migration has been estimated to have occurred around the 11th century AD, which corresponds to the Gusuku Period, marking the end of the prehistoric period in the area. Until this transition, it is widely accepted that people with Jomon-like genetic characteristics continued to inhabit the region for at least several thousand years. Therefore, the elevated levels of Jomon ancestry in Okinawa can be attributed to this historical event. An ancient population found in the Ryukyu Islands (specifically Miyako Island) called the &quot; () were found to have more northern coastal East Asian ancestry after 2800 BP or 775 AD, and is linked with population interactions between Ryukyu Islands and Sui-era China.

According to archaeological evidence, there is a prehistoric cultural differentiation between the Northern Ryukyu Islands (Amami Islands and Okinawa Islands) and the Southern Ryukyu Islands (Miyako Islands and Yaeyama Islands). The genome-wide differentiation was pronounced, especially between Okinawa and Miyako. It is considered to have arisen due to genetic drift rather than admixture with people from neighboring regions, with the divergence dated to the Holocene, and without major genetic contribution of the Pleistocene inhabitants to the present-day Southern Islanders. The Amami Islanders are also slightly more similar to the mainland population than the Okinawa Islanders. An autosomal DNA analysis from Okinawan samples concluded that they are most closely related to other Japanese and East Asian contemporary populations, sharing on average 80% admixture with mainland Japanese and 19% admixture with Chinese population, and that have isolate characteristics. The population closest to Ryukyu islanders is the mainland Japanese, followed by the Korean and Chinese populations. However, Taiwan aborigines were genetically distant from the Ryukyu islanders, even though these populations are geographically very close.

The female mtDNA and male Y chromosome markers are used to study human migrations. The research on the skeletal remains from the Neolithic Shell midden period (also known as Kaizuka period) in Okinawa, as well from the Gusuku Period, showed predominance of female haplogroups D4 and M7a and their genetic continuity in the contemporary female population of Okinawa. It is assumed that M7a represents &quot;Jomon genotype&quot; introduced by a Paleolithic ancestor from Southeast Asia or the southern region of the Asian continent, around the Last Glacial Maximum with the Ryukyu Islands as one of the probable origin spots; in contrast, the frequency of the D4 haplogroup is relatively high in East Asian populations, including in Japan, indicating immigrant Yayoi people, probably by the end of the late Kaizuka period, while haplogroup B4 presumably ancient aboriginal Taiwanese ancestry. However, as in the contemporary Japanese population M7 showed a decrease, whereas the frequency of the haplogroup N9b showed an increase from the south to north direction, it indicates that the mobility pattern of females and males was different as the distribution of Y haplogroups do not show a geographical gradient in contrast to mtDNA, meaning mainly different maternal origins of the contemporary Ryukyuan and Ainu people.

The research on the contemporary Okinawan male Y chromosome showed, in 2006; 55.6% of haplogroup D-P-M55, 22.2% O-P31, 15.6% O-M122, 4.4% C-M8, and 2.2% others. It is considered that the Y haplogroups expanded in a demic diffusion. The haplogroups D and C are considered of Neolithic and Paleolithic origin, with coalescence time of 19,400 YBP and expansion 12,600 YBP (14,500 YBP and 10,820 YBP respectively), and were isolated for thousands of years once land bridges between Japan and continental Asia disappeared at the end of the last glacial maximum 12,000 YBP. The haplogroup O began its expansion circa 4,000–3,810 years ago, and thus the haplogroups D-M55 and C-M8 belong to the Jomon&#x27;s male lineage, and haplogroup O belongs to the Yayoi&#x27;s male lineage. Haplogroup M12 is considered as mitochondrial counterpart of Y chromosome D lineage. This rare haplogroup was detected only in Yamato Japanese, Koreans, and Tibetans, with the highest frequency and diversity in Tibet.
===Anthropological studies===
The comparative studies on the dental diversity also showed long-term gene flow from outside source (main-island Honshu and from the southern part of East Asia), long-term isolation, and genetic drift which produced the morphological diversification of the modern Ryukyuans. However, the analysis contradicts the idea of homogeneity among the Jōmon people and a closer affinity between the Ainu and the Ryukyuans. A recent craniometric study shows that the Ryukyuans are closely related to the Yamato people and their common main ancestors, the Yayoi people. The Ryukyuans differ strongly from the Ainu people, which, according to the authors, is a strong evidence for the heterogeneity of the Jōmon period population.

As previous morphological studies, such as Kondo et al. 2017, the genetic and morphological analysis by Watanabe et al. 2021, confirmed that the Jōmon period people were heterogeneous and differed from each other depending on the region. A North-to-South cline was detected, with the southern Jōmon of Kyushu, Shikoku and southwestern Honshu being closer to contemporary East Asian people, while the northern Jōmon of Hokkaido and Tohoku being more distant from East Asians. The study results confirmed the &quot;dual-structure theory&quot; regarding the origin of modern Japanese and Ryukyuans, but found that noteworthy amounts of East Asian associated alleles were already present within the Jōmon period people prior to the migration of continental East Asians during the Yayoi period. The southern Jōmon, which are ancestral to the Ryukyuans, were anthropologically most similar to modern day East Asians and differed from Jōmon period samples of Hokkaido quite significantly.

=== Challenging the notion of ethnic homogeneity in Japan===
The existence of the Ryukyuans challenges the notion of ethnic homogeneity in post-WWII Japan. After the demise of the multi-ethnic Empire of Japan in 1945, successive governments had forged a single Japanese identity by advocating monoculturalism and denying the existence of ethnic minority groups. The notion of ethnic homogeneity was so ingrained in Japan that the former Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso notably claimed in 2020 that &quot;No other country but this one has lasted for as long as 2,000 years with one language, one ethnic group and one dynasty&quot;. Aso&#x27;s comment sparked strong criticism from the Ryukyuan community.

==History==
===Early history===

The Ryukyu Islands were inhabited from at least 32,000–18,000 years ago, but their fate and relation with contemporary Ryukyuans is uncertain. During the Jōmon period (i.e., Kaizuka) or so-called shell midden period (6,700–1,000 YBP) of the Northern Ryukyus, the population lived in a hunter-gatherer society, with similar mainland Jōmon pottery. In the latter part of Jōmon period, archaeological sites moved near the seashore, suggesting the engagement of people in fishery. It is considered that from the latter half of Jōmon period, the Ryukyu Islands developed their own culture. Some scholars consider that the language and cultural influence was more far-reaching than blending of race and physical types. The Yayoi culture which had a major influence on the Japanese islands, is traditionally dated from 3rd century BCE and recently from around 1000 BCE, and is notable for the introduction of Yayoi-type pottery, metal tools and cultivation of rice, however although some Yayoi pottery and tools were excavated on the Okinawa Islands, the rice was not widely cultivated before the 12th century CE, nor the Yayoi and the following Kofun period (250–538 CE) culture expanded into the Ryukyus. The Southern Ryukyus culture was isolated from the Northern, and its Shimotabaru period (4,500–3,000 YBP) was characterized by a specific style of pottery, and the Aceramic period (2,500–800 YBP), during which no pottery was produced in this region. Their prehistoric Yaeyama culture showed some intermingled affinities with various Taiwanese cultures, broadly, that the Sakishima Islands have some traces similar to the Southeast Asian and South Pacific cultures. The Amami Islands seem to be the islands with the most mainland Japanese influence. However, both north and south Ryukyus were culturally unified in the 10th century.

The finding of ancient Chinese knife money near Naha in Okinawa indicates a probable contact with the ancient Chinese state Yan as early as the 3rd century BCE. According to the , the Yan had relations with the Wa (&#x27;dwarf&#x27;, &#x27;short&#x27;) people living southeast of Korea, who could be related to both the mainland Japanese or Ryukyuans. The futile search for the elixir of immortality by Qin Shi Huang, the founder of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE), in which the emperor tried to cooperate with &quot;happy immortals&quot; who dwelt on the islands, could be related to both Japan and Ryukyu Islands. There is a lack of evidence that the missions by the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) reached the islands; however, as the Japanese did reach Han&#x27;s capital, notes from 57 CE do mention a general practice of tattooing among the people of &quot;hundred kingdoms&quot; in the eastern islands, a practice which was widespread and survived only among the Okinawan&#x27;s women, Ainu in Hokkaido, and Atayal people in Taiwan. Cao Wei (220–265) and Han dynasty records show that the inhabitants of western and southern Japan and Okinawa had a lot in common regarding political-social institutions until the 2nd century CE – they were of small stature, bred oxen and swine, and were ruled by women, with a special influence of women sorceresses, related to the Ryukyuan Noro priestesses which were closely associated with local political power until the 20th century, as well as with the Ryukyuan swine economy culture until World War II. It is suggested that the mention of a specific sorceress Pimeku, her death and successive conflict, is related to some socio-political challenges of the ancient matriarchal system.

The first certain mention of the islands and its people by the Chinese and Japanese is dated in the 7th century. Emperor Yang of Sui, due to previous tradition, between 607–608 held expeditions in search of the &quot;Land of Happy Immortals&quot;. As the Chinese envoy and the islanders linguistically could not understand each other, and the islanders did not want to accept the Sui rule and suzerainty, the Chinese envoy took many captives back to the court. The islands, by the Chinese named Liuqiu (Middle Chinese: ), would be pronounced by the Japanese as Ryukyu. However, when the Japanese diplomat Ono no Imoko arrived at the Chinese capital he noted that the captives probably arrived from the island of Yaku south of Kyushu. In 616 the Japanese annals for the first time mention the &quot;Southern Islands people&quot;, and for the half-century were noted some intruders from Yaku and Tanu. According to the , in 698 a small force dispatched by Japanese government successfully claimed the Tane-jima, Yakushima, Amami, Tokunoshima and other islands. The recorded that the Hayato people in southern Kyushu still had female chieftains in the early 8th century. In 699 are mentioned islands Amami and Tokara, in 714 Shingaki and Kume, in 720 some 232 persons who had submitted to the Japanese capital Nara, and at last Okinawa in 753. Nevertheless the mention or authority, over the centuries the Japanese influence spread slowly among the communities.

===Gusuku period===

The lack of written record resulted with later, 17th century royal tales both under Chinese and Japanese influence, which were efforts by local chieftains to explain the &quot;divine right&quot; of their royal authority, as well the then-political interests of Tokugawa &quot;shōguns&quot; from Minamoto clan who wanted to legitimize Japanese domination over Okinawa. The tradition states that the founder of the Tenson dynasty was a descendant of goddess Amamikyu, and the dynasty ruled 17,000 years and had 25 kings i.e. chieftains. However, the 24th throne was usurped from one of Tenson&#x27;s descendants by a man named Riyu, who was defeated in revolt led by Shunten (1187–1237), lord of Urasoe. Shunten&#x27;s parental origin is a matter of debate, according to 17th century romantic tales he was a son of a local Okinawan chief&#x27;s (&quot;anji&quot;) daughter and some Japanese adventurer, usually considered Minamoto no Tametomo, while historical and archeological-traditional evidence indicate men from the defeated Taira clan who fled Minamoto&#x27;s clan vengeance. The Shunten dynasty made two additional chieftains, Shunbajunki (1237–1248) and Gihon (1248–1259). As Gihon abdicated, his sessei Eiso (1260–1299), who claimed Tenson&#x27;s descent, founded the Eiso dynasty.

During the Gusuku period (c. 1187–1314), with recent chronology dated from c. 900–950 CE, Okinawans made significant political, social and economical growth. As the center of power moved away from the seashore to inland, the period is named after many &quot;gusuku&quot;, castle-like fortifications which were built in higher places. This period is also notable, compared to mainland Japan, for fairly late introduction of agricultural production of rice, wheat, millet and the overseas trading of these goods, as well during Shubanjunki&#x27;s rule the introduction of Japanese kana writing system in its older and simple phonetic form. After the years of famine and epidemic during the Gihon&#x27;s rule, Eiso introduced regular taxation system (of weapons, grains and cloth) in 1264 and as the government gained strength, the control extended from Okinawa toward the islands of Kume, Kerama, Iheya, and Amami Ōshima (1266). Between 1272 and 1274, as the Mongol invasions of Japan began, Okinawa on two occasions rejected the Mongols&#x27; authority demands. To Eiso&#x27;s reign period is also ascribed the introduction of Buddhism into Okinawa.

===Sanzan period===
During the rule of Eiso&#x27;s great-grandson, Tamagusuku (1314–1336), Okinawa became divided into three polities and began the so-called Sanzan period (1314–1429). The north and largest Hokuzan polity was the poorest due to forest and mountainous terrain (in which isolation was an advantage), with primitive farming and fishing. The central Chūzan polity was the most advantaged due to its developed castle towns and harbor facilities. The south Nanzan polity was the smallest, but endured because of good castle positions and sea merchants.

In this period, another rapid economical, social and cultural development of Ryukyu began as the polities had developed formal trade relations with Japan, Korea and China. During the Satto&#x27;s reign, Chūzan made tributary relations with China&#x27;s Ming dynasty in 1374 as the Hongwu Emperor sent envoys in 1372 to Okinawa. In the next two decades Chūzan made nine official missions to the Chinese capital, and the formal relations between them endured until 1872 (see Imperial Chinese missions to the Ryukyu Kingdom). Despite significant Chinese economical, cultural and political influence, the polities continued to maintain strong autonomy. In 1392, all three polities began to send extensive missions to the Korean Joseon kingdom. In 1403, Chūzan made formal relations with the Japanese Ashikaga shogunate, and an embassy was sent to Thailand in 1409. The contacts with Siam continued even in 1425, and were newly made with places like Palembang in 1428, Java in 1430, Malacca and Sumatra in 1463.

As in 1371, China initiated its maritime prohibition policy (Haijin) to Japan, Ryukyu gained a lot from its position as intermediary in the trade between Japan and China. They shipped horses, sulphur and seashells to China, from China brought ceramics, copper, and iron, from southeast Asian countries bought tin, ivory, spices (pepper), wood (sappanwood), which they sold to Japan, Korea or China, as well as transporting Chinese goods to Hakata Bay from where swords, silver and gold were brought.

In 1392, 36 Chinese families from Fujian were invited by the chieftain of Okinawa Island&#x27;s central polity (Chūzan) to settle near the port of Naha and to serve as diplomats, interpreters, and government officials. Some consider that many Ryukyuan officials were descended from these Chinese immigrants, being born in China or having Chinese grandfathers. They assisted the Ryukyuans in advancing their technology and diplomatic relations. From the same year onward Ryukyu was allowed to send official students to China i.e. Guozijian. The tributary relationship with China later became a basis of the 19th century Sino-Japanese disputes about the claims of Okinawa.

===Ryukyu Kingdom===
Between 1416 and 1429, Chūzan chieftain Shō Hashi successfully unified the principalities into the Ryukyuan Kingdom (1429–1879) with the castle town Shuri as royal capital, founded the First Shō dynasty, and the island continued to prosper through maritime trade, especially tributary relations with the Ming dynasty. The period of Shō Shin&#x27;s (1477–1526) rule, descendant from the Second Shō dynasty, is notable for peace and relative prosperity, peak in overseas trade, as well as expansion of the kingdom&#x27;s firm control to Kikaijima, Miyako-jima and Yaeyama Islands (1465–1524), while during Shō Sei (1526–1555) to Amami Ōshima (1537).

After the Kyūshū Campaign (1586–1587) by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, his assistant Kamei Korenori, who was interested in southern trade, wanted to be rewarded with the Ryukyu Islands. A paper fan found during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98) mentioning a title &quot;Kamei, Lord of Ryukyu&quot;, reveals that Hideyoshi at least nominally offered the post although he had no legitimate claim upon the islands. In 1591, Kamei ventured with a force to reclaim the islands, but the Shimazu clan stopped him as they guarded their special relationship with the Ryukyu kingdom. Hideyoshi was not very concerned about the quarrel because the invasion of Korea was more important in his mind. As the Ming&#x27;s influence weakened due to disorder in China, Japanese established posts in Southeast Asia, and the Europeans (Spanish and Portuguese) arrived, the kingdom&#x27;s overseas trade began to decline.

In the early 17th century during the Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1867), the first &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ieyasu intended to subject the kingdom to enable intermediary trade with China, and in 1603 ordered the Ryukyuan king to pay his respect to the shogunate. As the king did not react, with the instruction of the &quot;shōgun&quot;, the Satsuma feudal domain of the Shimazu clan in Kyūshū incorporated some of kingdom&#x27;s territory during the 1609 Invasion of Ryukyu. They nominally let a certain level of autonomy and independence to the kingdom due to Ming&#x27;s prohibition of trade with the shogunate, but forbade them trade with other countries except China. The Amami Islands became part of Shimazu&#x27;s territory, taxes were imposed, making them subordinate in the relations between Japan and China. Until the invasion, the Shimazu clan lords for four centuries had a vague title of the &quot;Lords of the Twelve Southern Islands&quot; or &quot;Southern Islands&quot;, although initially meaning the near Kyushu islands, then covering all the Ryukyu Islands. Later in the 1870s this was used as a &quot;justification&quot; of Japan&#x27;s sovereignty. From 1609 the Ryukyuan missions to Edo started which lasted until 1850.

During the rule of kings Shō Shitsu (1648–1668) and Shō Tei (1669–1709) i.e. sessei Shō Shōken (1666–1673) were recovered the internal social and economical stability with many laws about government organisation, and affairs like sugarcane production, and tax system with emphasis on agricultural production. The production was encouraged because Satsuma&#x27;s annual tax deprived Ryukyu&#x27;s internal resources. Although the production of sweet potatoes and sugar industry grew, the peasants were not allowed to enlarge their fields. The agricultural reforms especially continued under king Shō Kei (1713–1752) and his sanshikan advisor Sai On (1728–1752) whose &quot;Nomucho&quot; (Directory of Agricultural Affairs) from 1743 became the basis of the agricultural administration until the 19th century. In the Sakishima Islands great part of the tax was paid in textiles made of ramie. The relations with the Qing dynasty improved after their second mission when the first Ryukyuan official students were sent to China in 1688.

In the first half of the 19th century, French politicians like Jean-Baptiste Cécille unsuccessfully tried to conclude a French trade treaty with Ryukyu, with only a promise by Shuri government about the admission of Christian missionaries. However, due to extreme measures in teaching, Bernard Jean Bettelheim&#x27;s propagation of Protestantism between 1846–1854 was obscured by the government.

===Meiji period===
During the Meiji period (1868–1912) the process began, according to which the Ryukyuan Kingdom came under the jurisdiction of Kagoshima Prefecture in 1871, encompassing the southern tip of Kyushu and the Ryukyuan islands to its south; this created the Ryukyu Domain (1872–1879) of Meiji-era Japan. This method of gradual integration was designed to avoid both Ryukyuan and Chinese protests, with the ruling Shuri government unaware of the significance of these developments, including Japan&#x27;s decision to grant political representation to the Ryukyuan islanders involved in the Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1874).

In 1875, the Ryukyuans were forced to terminate their tributary relations with China, against their preference for a state of dual allegiance to both China and Japan, something a then-weakened China was unable to stop. A proposal by the 18th U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant for a sovereign Okinawa and the division of the other islands between China and Japan was rejected, with a last-minute decision by the Chinese government not to ratify the agreement rendering it null. On three occasions between 1875 and 1879, the last Ryukyuan King, Shō Tai, refused to submit to the demands placed upon his people, and in 1879, his domain was formally abolished and established as Okinawa Prefecture, forcing his move to Tokyo with the reduced status of Viscount.

Members of the Ryukyuan aristocratic classes such as Kōchi Chōjō and Rin Seikō continued to resist annexation for almost two decades; however, following the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), both Chinese and Ryukyuan interest in sovereignty faded as China renounced its claims to the island. Many historians criticise Meiji-era Japan&#x27;s characterisation of the process as being considered a relatively simple administrative change, rather than the creation of Japan&#x27;s first colony and the beginning of its &quot;inner colonialism&quot;.

During the Meiji period, as with the Ainu people of Hokkaido, the Ryukyuans had their own culture, religion, traditions and language suppressed by the Meiji government in the face of forced assimilation. From the 1880s onwards, schools forbade the display of Ryukyuan styles of dress, hairstyles and other visual aspects, considering them to be backwards and inferior, with students forced to wear Japanese clothing and to assimilate into Japanese culture. Indoctrination into a militaristic and Emperor-centred ideology for children began from the age of beginning elementary school onwards; the ultimate goal of this education was a total unification of the Ryukyuans into the Yamato people, embodying the ideal of ethnic purity, with contemporary &quot;Nihonjiron&quot; literature for the time ignoring Japan&#x27;s minorities). Ryukyuans often faced prejudice, humiliation in the workplace and ethnic discrimination, with the Ryukyuan elite divided into factions either in support of or in opposition to assimilation. Negative stereotypes and discrimination were common against the Ryukyuans in the Japanese society.

Around and especially after the Japanese annexation of Taiwan in 1895, Japan&#x27;s developmental focus shifted away from Okinawa, resulting in a period of famine known as (&quot;Cycad hell&quot;). Between 1920 and 1921, a fall in sugar prices, as well as the transfer of Japan&#x27;s sugar production to Taiwan, led to Ryukyu being the poorest prefecture, despite having the heaviest taxation burden; the drop in sugar prices would continue into 1931, further worsening the situation. As a result of the ensuing economic crisis, many people were forced to either find work in Japan (often Osaka and Kobe) or abroad in Taiwan. By 1935, roughly 15% of the population had emigrated.

===WWII and post-war history===
During World War II and battles like the Battle of Okinawa (1945), approximately 150,000 civilians (1/3 of the population) were killed in Okinawa alone. After the war, the Ryukyu Islands were occupied by the United States Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands (1945–1950), but the U.S. maintained control even after the 1951 Treaty of San Francisco, which went into effect on April 28, 1952, as the USMMGR was replaced by the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands (1950–1972). During this period the U.S. military requisitioned private land for the building of their facilities, with the former owners put into refugee camps, and its personnel committed thousands of crimes against the civilians. Only twenty years later, on 15 May 1972, Okinawa and nearby islands were returned to Japan. Whereas the Japanese had enjoyed political freedom and economic prosperity in the post-war years, the facilities, used for the purposes of Japanese regional security against the communist threat, had a negative economic impact on the Islands, leading to many Ryukyuans feeling cheated, some considering the facilities a national disgrace. Since 1972 there have been extensive plans to bring Okinawa&#x27;s economy up to the national level, as well continued support for the local culture and a revival of traditional arts started by the USCAR.

Okinawa comprises just 0.6% of Japan&#x27;s total land mass, yet about 75% of all U.S. military installations stationed in Japan are assigned to bases in Okinawa. The presence of the military remains a sensitive issue in local politics. Negative feelings toward the mainland Government, Emperor (especially Hirohito due to his involvement in the sacrifice of Okinawa and later military occupation), and U.S. military (USFJ, SACO) have often caused open criticism and protests, for example by 85,000 people in 1995 after the U.S. military rape incident, and by 110,000 people in 2007 due to the Japanese Ministry of Education&#x27;s textbook revisions (see MEXT controversy) which critics say downplays the involvement of the Japanese military in the forced mass suicide of the civilians during the Battle of Okinawa. For many years the Emperors avoided visiting Okinawa, with the first ever in history done by Akihito in 1993, since it was assumed that his visits would likely cause uproar, as in July 1975 when Akihito as a crown prince visited Okinawa and a firebomb was thrown at him, although these tensions have eased in recent years. Discrimination against Okinawans both past and present on the part of the mainland Japanese is the cause of their smoldering resentment against the government. There is a small post-war Ryukyu independence movement, but there are also Okinawans who wish to be assimilated with the mainland. A poll in 2017 by the Okinawa Times, Asahi Shimbun and Ryukyusu Asahi Broadcasting Corporation (QAB) jointly conducted prefectural public opinion surveys for voters in the prefecture. 82% of Okinawa citizens chose &quot;I&#x27;m glad that Okinawa has returned as a Japanese prefecture&quot;. It was 90% for respondents of the ages of 18 to 29, 86% for those in their 30s, 84% for those aged 40–59, 72% for respondents in their 60s, 74% for those over the age of 70.

==Demography==

Ryukyuans tend to see themselves as bound together by their home island and, especially among older Ryukyuans, usually consider themselves from Okinawa first and Japan second. The average annual income per resident of Okinawa in 2006 was ¥2.09 million, placing the prefecture at the bottom of the list of 47.

The Okinawans have a very low age-adjusted mortality rate at older ages and among the lowest prevalence of cardiovascular disease and other age-associated diseases in the world. Furthermore, Okinawa has long had the highest life expectancy at older ages, as well has had among the highest prevalence of centenarians among the 47 Japanese prefectures, also the world, since records began to be kept by the Ministry of Health in the early 1960s despite the high birth rate and expanding population of Okinawa prefecture. This longevity phenotype has been in existence since records have been kept in Japan, and despite the well-known dietary and other nongenetic lifestyle advantages of the Okinawans (Blue Zone), there may be some additional unknown genetic influence favoring this extreme phenotype. The Okinawa Centenarian Study (OCS) research team began to work in 1976, making it the world&#x27;s longest ongoing population-based study of centenarians.

==Culture==
===Language===

Similarities between the Ryukyuan and Japanese languages point to a common origin, possibly of immigrants from continental Asia to the archipelago. Although previously ideologically considered by Japanese scholars as a Japanese dialect and a descendant of Old Japanese, modern linguists such as Thomas Pellard (2015) now classify the Ryukyuan languages as a distinct subfamily of Japonic that diverged before the Old Japanese period (c. 8th century CE); this places them in contrast to Japonic languages that are direct descendants of Old Japanese, namely Japanese and Hachijō. Early literature which records the language of the Old Japanese imperial court shows archaisms which are closer to Okinawan dialects, while later periods of Japanese exhibit more significant Sinicization (such as Sino-Japanese vocabulary) than most Ryukyuan languages. This can be attributed to the fact that the Japanese (or Yamato people) received writing from the Sinosphere roughly a millennium before the Ryukyuan languages.

As the Jōmon-Yayoi transition (c. 1000 BCE) represents the formative period of the contemporary Japanese people from a genetic standpoint, it is argued that the Japonic languages are related to the Yayoi migrants as well. The estimated time of separation between Ryukyuan and mainland Japanese is a matter of debate due to methodological problems; older estimates (1959–2009) varied between 300 BCE and 700 CE, while novel (2009–2011) around 2nd century BCE to 100 CE, which has a lack of correlation with archeology and new chronology according to which Yayoi period started around 950 BCE, or the proposed spread of the Proto-Ryukyuan speakers to the islands in the 10–12th century from Kyushu. Based on linguistic differences, they separated at least before the 7th century, before or around Kofun period (c. 250–538), while mainland Proto-Ryukyuan was in contact with Early Middle Japanese until 13th century.

The Ryukyuan languages can be subdivided into two main groups, Northern Ryukyuan languages and Southern Ryukyuan languages. The Southern Ryukyuan subfamily shows north-to-south expansion, while Northern Ryukyuan does not, and several hypothetical scenarios can be proposed to explain this. It is generally considered that the likely homeland of Japonic—and thus the original expansion of Proto-Ryukyuan—was in Kyushu, though an alternate hypothesis proposes an expansion from the Ryukyu Islands to mainland Japan.

Although authors differ regarding which varieties are counted as dialects or languages, one possible classification considers there to be five Ryukyuan languages: Amami, Okinawa, Miyako, Yaeyama and Yonaguni, while a sixth, Kunigami, is sometimes differentiated from Okinawan due to its diversity. Within these languages exist dialects of local towns and specific islands, many of which have gone extinct. Although the Shuri dialect of Okinawan was historically a prestige language of the Kingdom of Ryukyu, there is no officially standardized Ryukyuan language. Thus, the Ryukyuan languages as a whole constitute a cluster of local dialects that can be considered unroofed abstand languages.

During the Meiji and post-Meiji period, the Ryukyuan languages were considered to be dialects of Japanese and viewed negatively. They were suppressed by the Japanese government in policies of forced assimilation and into using the standard Japanese language. From 1907, children were prohibited to speak Ryukyuan languages in school, and since the mid-1930s there existed dialect cards, a system of punishment for the students who spoke in a non-standard language. Speaking a Ryukyuan language was deemed an unpatriotic act; by 1939, Ryukyuan speakers were denied service and employment in government offices, while by the Battle of Okinawa in 1945, the Japanese military was commanded to consider Ryukyuan speakers as spies to be punished by death, with many reports that such actions were carried out. After World War II, during the United States occupation, the Ryukyuan languages and identity were distinctively promoted, also because of ideo-political reasons to separate the Ryukyus from Japan. However, resentment against the American occupation intensified Ryukyuans&#x27; rapport and unification with Japan, and since 1972 there has followed re-incursion of the standard Japanese and further diminution of the Ryukyuan languages.

It is considered that contemporary people older than 85 exclusively use Ryukyuan, between 45 and 85 use Ryukyuan and standard Japanese depending on family or working environment, younger than 45 are able to understand Ryukyuan, while younger than 30 mainly are not able to understand nor speak Ryukyuan languages. Only older people speak Ryukyuan languages, because Japanese replaced it as the daily language in nearly every context. Some younger people speak Okinawan Japanese which is a type of Japanese. It is not a dialect of the Okinawan language. The six Ryukyuan languages are listed on the UNESCO&#x27;s Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger since 2009, as they could disappear by the mid-century (2050). It is unclear whether this recognition was too late, despite some positive influence by the Society of Spreading Okinawan.

===Religion===
Indigenous Ryukyuan religion places strong emphasis upon the role of the women in the community, with women holding positions as shamans and guardians of the home and hearth. The status of women in traditional society is higher than in China and Japan. Although the contemporary kinship system is patrilineal and patrilocal, until the 20th century it was often bilateral and matrilocal, with common village endogamy. Shisa statues can often be seen on or in front of houses—this relates to the ancient Ryukyuan belief that the male spirit is the spirit of the outside and the female spirit is the spirit of the inside. Godhood is mimicked with many attributes, and its in ease without any underlying symbolic order.

The village priestesses, Noro, until the 20th century used the white cloth and magatama beads. The noro&#x27;s duty was to preserve the generational fire in the hearth, a communal treasure, resulting with tabu system about the fire custodian in which they had to be virgins to maintain close communication with the ancestors. The office became hereditary, usually of the noro&#x27;s brother&#x27;s female child. The center of worship was represented by three heartstones within or near the house. The belief in the spiritual predominance of the sister was more prominent in Southern Ryukyus.

The introduction of Buddhism is ascribed to a 13th century priest from Japan (mostly funeral rites), while the 14th century trade relations resulted with Korean Buddhism influences (including some in architecture), as well Shinto practices from Japan. Buddhism and indigenous religion were ideological basis until 18th century, when Confucianism gradually and officially became government ideology during Shō On (1795–1802), much to the dismay of Kumemura. It was mostly important to the upper class families. Among the Catholic converts was not lost the former religious consciousness.

Until the 18th century, the Ryukyuan kings visited the Sefa-utaki (historical sacred place) caves for worship. Another traditional sacred places are springs Ukinju-Hain-ju, where was placed the first rice plantation, and small island Kudaka, where the &quot;five fruits and grains&quot; were introduced by divine people, perhaps strangers with agricultural techniques. The foremost account, which claimed common origin between the Japanese and Ryukyuans, was made-up by Shō Shōken in the 17th century, to end up the pilgrimage of the Ryukyu king and chief priestess to the Kudaka island.

During the Meiji period the government replaced Buddhism with Shintoism as the islands&#x27; state religion, and ordered; rearrangement of statues and redesign of shrines and temples to incorporate indigenous deities into national Shinto pantheon; Shinto worship preceded indigenous, Buddhist, or Christian ritual; transformation of local divinities into guardian gods. In the 1920s was ordered building of Shinto shrines and remodelling of previous with Shinto architectural symbols, paid by local tax money, which was a financial burden due to the collapse of sugar prices in 1921 which devastated Okinawa&#x27;s economy. In 1932 were ordered to house and support Shinto clergy from the mainland.

Most Ryukyuans of the younger generations are not serious adherents of the indigenous religion anymore. Additionally, since being under Japanese control, Shinto and Buddhism are also practiced and typically mixed with local beliefs and practices.

===Cuisine===

Okinawan food is rich in vitamins and minerals and has a good balance of protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Although rice is a staple food (taco rice mixes it with beef), pork (&quot;mimigā and chiragā&quot;, dishes Rafute and Soki), seaweed, rich miso (fermented soybean) pastes and soups (Jūshī), sweet potato and brown sugar all feature prominently in traditional cuisine. Most famous to tourists is the &quot;Momordica charantia&quot;, &quot;gōya&quot; (bitter melon), which is often mixed into a representative Okinawan stir fry dish known as champurū (Goya champuru). Kōrēgusu is a common hot sauce condiment used in various dishes including noodle soup Okinawa soba. Some specifically consumed algae include Caulerpa lentillifera. Traditional sweets include chinsuko, hirayachi, sata andagi, and muchi. Local beverages include juice from &quot;Citrus depressa&quot;, turmeric tea (&quot;ukoncha&quot;), and the alcoholic beverage awamori.

The weight-loss Okinawa diet derives from their cuisine and has only 30% of the sugar and 15% of the grains of the average Japanese dietary intake.

===Arts===

The techniques of self-defense and using farm tools as weapons against armed opponents—called karate by today&#x27;s martial artists—were created by Ryukyuans who probably incorporated some and techniques from China into a complete system of attack and defense known simply as (literally meaning &quot;hand&quot;). These martial arts varied slightly from town to town, and were named for their towns of origin, examples being Naha-te (currently known as Goju-Ryū), Tomari-te and Shuri-te.

The Kabura-ya (Japanese signal arrow) still has a ceremonial use for house, village or festival celebration in Okinawa.
It is considered that the rhythms and patterns of dances, like Eisa and Angama, represent legends and prehistoric heritage. Ryūka genre of songs and poetry originate from the Okinawa Islands. From the Chinese traditional instrument in the 16th century developed the Okinawan instrument from which the and the Japanese derive.

Women frequently wore indigo tattoos known as &quot;hajichi&quot; on the backs of their hands, a sign of adulthood and talisman to protect them from evil. These tattoos were banned in 1899 by the Meiji government. In remote districts their &quot;katakashira&quot; off-center topknot, similar to that of the Yami and some Filipino ethnic groups, among men and women also disappeared in the early 20th century.

The &quot;bashôfu&quot;, literally meaning &quot;banana-fibre cloth&quot;, is designated as a part of Ryukyu and Japan &quot;important intangible cultural properties&quot;. The weaving using indigenous ramie was also widespread in the archipelago, both originated before the 14th century.

Originally living in thatching houses, townsmen developed architecture modeled after Japanese, Chinese and Korean structures. Other dwellings suggest a tropical origin, and some villages have high stone walls, with similar structural counterpart in Yami people at Orchid Island.

<text>Henry Roeland Byrd (December 19, 1918 – January 30, 1980), better known as Professor Longhair or &quot;Fess&quot; for short, was an American singer and pianist who performed New Orleans blues. He was active in two distinct periods, first in the heyday of early rhythm and blues and later in the resurgence of interest in traditional jazz after the founding of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in 1970. His piano style has been described as &quot;instantly recognizable, combining rumba, mambo, and calypso&quot;.

Music journalist Tony Russell (in his book &quot;The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray&quot;) wrote that &quot;The vivacious rhumba-rhythmed piano blues and choked singing typical of Fess were too weird to sell millions of records; he had to be content with siring musical offspring who were simple enough to manage that, like Fats Domino or Huey &quot;Piano&quot; Smith. But he is also acknowledged as a father figure by subtler players like Allen Toussaint and Dr. John.&quot;

== Biography ==
Byrd was born on December 19, 1918, in Bogalusa, Louisiana, the son of Ella Mae (née Rhodes) and James Byrd. His distinctive style of piano playing was influenced by learning to play on an instrument that was missing some keys.

He began his career in New Orleans in 1948. Mike Tessitore, owner of the Caldonia Club, gave Longhair his stage name. Longhair first recorded in a band called the Shuffling Hungarians in 1949, creating four songs (including the first version of his signature song, &quot;Mardi Gras in New Orleans&quot;) for the Star Talent record label. Union problems curtailed their release, but Longhair&#x27;s next effort for Mercury Records the same year was a winner. Throughout the 1950s, he recorded for Atlantic Records, Federal Records and local labels.

Professor Longhair had only one national commercial hit, &quot;Bald Head&quot;, in 1950, under the name Roy Byrd and His Blues Jumpers. He also recorded his favorites, &quot;Tipitina&quot; and &quot;Go to the Mardi Gras&quot;. He lacked crossover appeal among white and wide audiences. Yet, he is regarded (and was acknowledged) as being a musician who was highly influential for other prominent musicians, such as Fats Domino, Allen Toussaint and Dr. John.

After suffering a stroke, Professor Longhair recorded &quot;No Buts – No Maybes&quot; in 1957. He re-recorded &quot;Go to the Mardi Gras&quot; in 1959. He first recorded &quot;Big Chief&quot; with its composer, Earl King, in 1964. In the 1960s, Professor Longhair&#x27;s career faltered. He became a janitor to support himself and fell into a gambling habit.

After a few years during which he disappeared from the music scene, Professor Longhair&#x27;s musical career finally received &quot;a well deserved renaissance&quot; and wide recognition. He was invited to perform at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in 1971 and at the Newport Jazz Festival and the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1973. His album &quot;The London Concert&quot; showcases work he did on a visit to the United Kingdom. That significant career resurrection saw the recording of the album &quot;Live on the Queen Mary&quot;, which was recorded on March 24, 1975, during a private party hosted by Paul McCartney and Linda McCartney on board the retired .

By the 1980s his albums, such as &quot;Crawfish Fiesta&quot; on Alligator Records and &quot;New Orleans Piano&quot; on Atlantic Records, had become readily available across America. In 1974 he appeared on the PBS series &quot;Soundstage&quot; (with Dr. John, Earl King, and The Meters). In 1980 he co-starred (with Tuts Washington and Allen Toussaint) in the film documentary &quot;Piano Players Rarely Ever Play Together&quot; which was produced and directed by filmmaker Stevenson Palfi. That documentary (which aired on public television in 1982 and was rarely seen since), plus a long interview with Fess (which was recorded two days before his sudden death), were included in the 2018 released project &quot;Fess Up&quot;.

Professor Longhair died in his sleep of a heart attack while the filming of the documentary was under way (and before the live concert, which was planned to be its climax). Footage from his funeral was included in the documentary. He was interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in New Orleans.

Professor Longhair&#x27;s manager through those renaissance years of his career was Allison Miner, of which jazz producer George Wein was quoted saying: &quot;Her devotion to Professor Longhair gave him the best years of his life.&quot;

== Accolades ==
Professor Longhair was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1981. In 1987, he was awarded a posthumous Grammy Award for a collection of recordings produced by Quint Davis in 1971 and 1972 released as &quot;House Party New Orleans Style&quot;. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.

Professor Longhair was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2016 at his former home in New Orleans.

== In popular culture ==
His song &quot;Tipitina&quot; was covered by Hugh Laurie on the 2011 CD album &quot;Let Them Talk&quot;. Laurie is a long-time fan, having used Longhair&#x27;s &quot;Go to the Mardi Gras&quot; as the theme for the pilot episode of &quot;A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie&quot;. Laurie used to perform these two songs regularly during his world concert tours of 2011–2014 with The Copper Bottom Band, and in March 2013 paid tribute to Professor Longhair in a special concert on board .

The New Orleans music venue Tipitina&#x27;s is named after one of Longhair&#x27;s signature songs, and was created specifically as a venue for Longhair to perform in his aged years. A bust of Professor Longhair, sculpted by bluesman Coco Robicheaux, greets visitors upon entering the venue.

== Afro-Cuban elements ==
In the 1940s, Professor Longhair was playing with Caribbean musicians, listening a lot to Perez Prado&#x27;s mambo records, and absorbing and experimenting with it all. He was especially enamored with Cuban music. Longhair&#x27;s style was known locally as &quot;rumba-boogie&quot;. Alexander Stewart stated that Longhair was a key figure bridging the worlds of boogie-woogie and the new style of rhythm and blues. In his composition &quot;Misery&quot;, Professor Longhair played a habanera-like figure in his left hand. The deft use of triplets in the right hand is a characteristic of Longhair&#x27;s style.

Tresillo, the habanera, and related African-based single-celled figures have long been heard in the left hand-part of piano compositions by New Orleans musicians, such as Louis Moreau Gottschalk (&quot;Souvenirs from Havana&quot;, 1859) and Jelly Roll Morton (&quot;The Crave&quot;, 1910). One of Longhair&#x27;s great contributions was the adaptation of Afro-Cuban two-celled, clave-based patterns in New Orleans blues. Michael Campbell stated, &quot;Rhythm and blues influenced by Afro-Cuban music first surfaced in New Orleans. Professor Longhair&#x27;s influence was ... far reaching. In several of his early recordings, Professor Longhair blended Afro-Cuban rhythms with rhythm and blues. The most explicit is &#x27;Longhair&#x27;s Blues Rhumba&#x27;, where he overlays a straightforward blues with a clave rhythm.&quot; The guajeo-like piano part for the rumba-boogie &quot;Mardi Gras in New Orleans&quot; (1949) employs the 2-3 clave onbeat/offbeat motif. The 2–3 clave time line is written above the piano excerpt for reference.

According to Dr. John, the Professor &quot;put funk into music ... Longhair&#x27;s thing had a direct bearing I&#x27;d say on a large portion of the funk music that evolved in New Orleans.&quot; This is the syncopated, but straight subdivision feel of Cuban music (as opposed to swung subdivisions). Alexander Stewart stated that the popular feel was passed along from &quot;New Orleans—through James Brown&#x27;s music, to the popular music of the 1970s,&quot; adding, &quot;The singular style of rhythm &amp; blues that emerged from New Orleans in the years after World War II played an important role in the development of funk. In a related development, the underlying rhythms of American popular music underwent a basic, yet generally unacknowledged transition from triplet or shuffle feel to even or straight eighth notes. Concerning funk motifs, Stewart stated, &quot;This model, it should be noted, is different from a time line (such as clave and tresillo) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle.&quot;

<doc id="166278" wikidata="Q229322" url="?curid=166278" title="Dinah Washington">
<text>Dinah Washington (; born Ruth Lee Jones; August 29, 1924 – December 14, 1963) was an American singer and pianist, one of the most popular black female recording artists of the 1950s. Primarily a jazz vocalist, she performed and recorded in a wide variety of styles including blues, R&amp;B, and traditional pop music, and gave herself the title of &quot;Queen of the Blues&quot;. She was also known as &quot;Queen of the Jukeboxes&quot;. She was a 1986 inductee of the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.

==Early life==
Ruth Lee Jones was born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to Alice and Ollie Jones, and moved to Chicago as a child. She became deeply involved in gospel music and played piano for the choir in St. Luke&#x27;s Baptist Church while still in elementary school. She sang gospel music in church and played piano, directing her church choir in her teens and was a member of the Sallie Martin Gospel Singers. When she joined the Sallie Martin group, she dropped out of Wendell Phillips High School. She sang lead with the first female gospel singers formed by Sallie Martin, who was co-founder of the Gospel Singers Convention. Her involvement with the gospel choir occurred after she won an amateur contest at Chicago&#x27;s Regal Theater where she sang &quot;I Can&#x27;t Face the Music&quot;.

==Career==
===Clubs===
After winning a talent contest at the age of 15, she began performing in clubs. By 1941–42, she was performing in such Chicago clubs as Dave&#x27;s Café and the Downbeat Room of the Sherman Hotel (with Fats Waller). She was playing at the Three Deuces, a jazz club, when a friend took her to hear Billie Holiday at the Garrick Stage Bar. Club owner Joe Sherman was so impressed with her singing of &quot;I Understand&quot;, backed by the Cats and the Fiddle, who were appearing in the Garrick&#x27;s upstairs room, that he hired her. During her year at the Garrick—she sang upstairs while Holiday performed in the downstairs room—she acquired the name by which she became known. She credited Joe Sherman with suggesting the change from Ruth Jones, made before Lionel Hampton came to hear Dinah at the Garrick. Hampton&#x27;s visit brought an offer, and Washington worked as his female band vocalist after she had sung with the band for its opening at the Chicago Regal Theatre.

===Early recordings===
She made her recording debut for the Keynote label that December with &quot;Evil Gal Blues&quot;, written by Leonard Feather and backed by Hampton and musicians from his band, including Joe Morris (trumpet) and Milt Buckner (piano). Both that record and its follow-up, &quot;Salty Papa Blues&quot;, made the &quot;Billboard&quot; &quot;Harlem Hit Parade&quot; in 1944. In December 1945, she made a series of 12 recordings for Apollo Records, 10 of which were issued, featuring the Lucky Thompson All Stars.

===Solo recordings and hits===
She stayed with Hampton&#x27;s band until 1946, after the Keynote label folded, and signed for Mercury Records as a solo singer. Her first record for Mercury, a version of Fats Waller&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot;, was another hit, starting a long string of success. Between 1948 and 1955, she had 27 R&amp;B top-10 hits, making her one of the most popular and successful singers of the period. Both &quot;Am I Asking Too Much&quot; (1948) and &quot;Baby Get Lost&quot; (1949) reached Number 1 on the R&amp;B chart, and her version of &quot;I Wanna Be Loved&quot; (1950) crossed over to reach Number 22 on the US Pop Chart. Her hit recordings included blues, standards, novelties, pop covers, and even a version of Hank Williams&#x27; &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot; (R&amp;B Number 3, 1951). At the same time as her biggest popular success, she also recorded sessions with many leading jazz musicians, including Clifford Brown and Clark Terry on the album &quot;Dinah Jams&quot; (1954), and also recorded with Cannonball Adderley and Ben Webster.

In 1950, Washington performed at the sixth Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles which was produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. on June 25. Also featured on the same day were Lionel Hampton, PeeWee Crayton&#x27;s Orchestra, Roy Milton and his Orchestra, Tiny Davis and Her Hell Divers, and other artists. There were 16,000 reported to be in attendance, and the concert ended early because of a fracas while Lionel Hampton played &quot;Flying High&quot;. Washington returned to perform at the twelfth Cavalcade of Jazz also at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles on September 2, 1956. Also performing that day were Little Richard, The Mel Williams Dots, Julie Stevens, Chuck Higgins&#x27; Orchestra, Bo Rhambo, Willie Hayden &amp; Five Black Birds, The Premiers, Gerald Wilson and His 20-Pc. Recording Orchestra and Jerry Gray and his Orchestra.

In 1959, she had her first top ten pop hit, with a version of &quot;What a Diff&#x27;rence a Day Made&quot;, which made Number 4 on the US pop chart. Her band at that time included arranger and conductor Belford Hendricks, with Kenny Burrell (guitar), Joe Zawinul (piano), and Panama Francis (drums). She followed it up with a version of Irving Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Unforgettable&quot;, and then two highly successful duets in 1960 with Brook Benton, &quot;Baby (You&#x27;ve Got What It Takes)&quot; (No. 5 Pop, No. 1 R&amp;B) and &quot;A Rockin&#x27; Good Way (To Mess Around and Fall in Love)&quot; (No. 7 Pop, No. 1 R&amp;B). Her last big hit was &quot;September in the Rain&quot; in 1961 (No. 23 Pop, No. 5 R&amp;B).

Washington notably performed two numbers in the dirty blues genre. The songs were &quot;Long John Blues&quot; about her dentist, with lyrics like &quot;He took out his trusty drill. Told me to open wide. He said he wouldn&#x27;t hurt me, but he filled my whole inside.&quot; She also recorded a song called &quot;Big Long Slidin&#x27; Thing&quot;, supposedly about a trombonist.

Washington was well known for singing torch songs. In 1962, she hired a male backing trio called the Allegros, consisting of Jimmy Thomas on drums, Earl Edwards on sax, and Jimmy Sigler on organ. Edwards was replaced on sax by John Payne. A &quot;Variety&quot; writer praised their vocals as &quot;effective choruses&quot;.

One source states that Washington &quot;produced 45 R&amp;B-charted hits between 1948 and 1961, including 16 Top 15 placements between 1948 and 1950&quot;.

===Appraisals and notable performances===
In the 1950s and early 1960s before her death, Washington occasionally performed on the Las Vegas Strip. Tony Bennett said of Washington during a recording session with Amy Winehouse: 
According to Richard S. Ginell at AllMusic:
Washington&#x27;s achievements included appearances at the Newport Jazz Festival (1955–1959), the Randalls Island Jazz Festival in New York City (1959), and the International Jazz Festival in Washington, D.C. (1962), frequent gigs at Birdland (1958, 1961–1962), and performances in 1963 with Count Basie and Duke Ellington.

==Personal life and death==

Washington was married seven times, although according to other sources she had six, eight or nine husbands.

Early in the morning of December 14, 1963, Washington&#x27;s last husband, football player Dick &quot;Night Train&quot; Lane, went to sleep with Washington and awoke later to find her slumped over and not responsive. Dr. B.C. Ross pronounced her dead at the scene at age 39. An autopsy later showed a lethal combination of secobarbital and amobarbital, prescriptions for her insomnia and diet, which contributed to her death. She is buried in the Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois.

<doc id="166280" wikidata="Q38352698" url="?curid=166280" title="Ultranationalism">
<text>Ultranationalism or extreme nationalism is an extreme form of nationalism in which a country asserts or maintains hegemony, supremacy, or other forms of control over other nations (usually through violent coercion) to pursue its specific interests. Ultranationalist entities have been associated with the engagement of political violence even during peacetime.

In ideological terms, scholars such as the British political theorist Roger Griffin have found that ultranationalism arises from seeing modern nation-states as living organisms which are directly akin to physical people because they can decay, grow, and die, and additionally, they can experience rebirth. In stark, mythological ways, political campaigners have divided societies into those which are perceived as being degenerately inferior and those which are perceived as having great cultural destinies. Ultranationalism has been an aspect of fascism, with historic governments such as the regimes of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany building on ultranationalist foundations by using specific plans for supposed widespread national renewal. Another major example was the communist Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia that promoted ultranationalism.

==Background concepts and broader context==


British political theorist Roger Griffin has stated that ultranationalism is essentially founded on xenophobia in a way that finds supposed legitimacy &quot;through deeply mythicized narratives of past cultural or political periods of historical greatness or of old scores to settle against alleged enemies&quot;. It can also draw on &quot;vulgarized forms&quot; of different aspects of the natural sciences such as anthropology and genetics, eugenics specifically playing a role, in order &quot;to rationalize ideas of national superiority and destiny, of degeneracy and subhumanness&quot; in Griffin&#x27;s opinion. Ultranationalists view the modern nation-state as, according to Griffin, a living organism directly akin to a physical person such that it can decay, grow, die, and additionally experience rebirth. He has highlighted Nazi Germany as a regime which was founded on ultranationalism.

Ultranationalist activism can adopt varying attitudes towards historical traditions within the populace. For instance, the British Union of Fascists inside the United Kingdom adopted a secularist-minded platform centered on perceived technological progress. In contrast, the Iron Guard inside Romania utilized a hardline form of mysticism-driven religion to encourage determination among the nation&#x27;s ultranationalists. Nonetheless, obsessive views on ethnicity and other divisions as well as connecting politics to motifs of sacrifice generally constitute the psychological framework behind these movements.

According to American scholar Janusz Bugajski, summing up the doctrine in practical terms, &quot;in its most extreme or developed forms, ultra-nationalism resembles fascism, marked by a xenophobic disdain of other nations, support for authoritarian political arrangements verging on totalitarianism, and a mythical emphasis on the &#x27;organic unity&#x27; between a charismatic leader, an organizationally amorphous movement-type party, and the nation&quot;. Bugajski believes that civic nationalism and the related concept of patriotism both can contain significantly positive elements, contributing to the common social good at times such as during national calamities. These doctrines stand in contrast, in his opinion, to the extreme approach of certain ideologies with more irrational actions.

==Historical movements and analysis==
American historian Walter Skya has written in &quot;Japan&#x27;s Holy War: The Ideology of Radical Shinto Ultranationalism&quot; that ultranationalism in Japan drew upon traditional Shinto spiritual beliefs and militaristic attitudes regarding the nation&#x27;s racial identity. By the early twentieth century, fanaticism arising from this combination of ethnic nationalism and religious nationalism caused opposition to democratic governance and support for Japanese territorial expansion. Skya particularly noted in his work the connection between ultranationalism and political violence by citing how, between 1921 and 1936, three serving and two former Prime Ministers of Japan were assassinated. The totalitarian Japanese government of the 1930s and 1940s did not just rely on encouragement by the country&#x27;s military. It additionally received widespread popular support.

The Cambodian historian Sambo Manara has found that the belief system sets forth a vision of supremacism in terms of international relations whereby xenophobia or hatred of foreigners to the point of extremism leads to policies of social separation and segregation. He has argued that the Cambodian genocide is a specific example of this ideology when it is applied in practice. &quot;Obviously, it was ultranationalism, combined with the notion of class struggle in communism and a group of politicians, which lead to the establishment of Democratic Kampuchea, a ruthless regime which claimed approximately three million lives&quot;, he has remarked, with militant leaders finally deciding to &quot;cut all diplomatic and economic ties with almost all countries&quot; due to a &quot;narrow-minded doctrine without taking into account all the losses they would face&quot;. In Manara&#x27;s opinion, &quot;this effectively destroyed the nation.&quot;

The absolute dictatorship of the Romanian leader Nicolae Ceaușescu has also been described as an example of communism taking an ultranationalist approach by &quot;Haaretz&quot;. The Israeli publication cited the antisemitism of the dictator in terms of actions such as his historical denialism of the Holocaust. Ceausescu also made efforts to purge Romanians who had Jewish backgrounds from positions of political authority.

&quot;Haaretz&quot; has also labeled the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán an ultranationalist, due to his views on autocratic rule and racial identity, particularly, Orbán&#x27;s public condemnation of &quot;race-mixing&quot;. He has also been called an ultranationalist by NPR, an American news agency, citing his opposition to democratic liberalism.

In late 2015, the Israeli political journalist Gideon Levy wrote that the Israeli–Palestinian conflict has led to the decay of the civil society within Israel, with an ultranationalist movement that &quot;bases its power on incitement to hatred&quot; using &quot;folkloric religion&quot; gaining ground over decades so that:


Russian irredentism, in which a militant imperial state that stretches across both Asia and Europe without regard for current international borders is proposed, has been described as ultranationalism by the U.S. publication the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, with the aggressive actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin being credited as an evolution of political arguments which were made by multiple figures in the past. Examples include Nikolai Berdyaev, Aleksandr Dugin (the author of 1997&#x27;s &quot;The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia&quot;), Lev Gumilyov, and Ivan Ilyin. The newspaper highlighted the justifications which were given in support of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, quoting Putin&#x27;s declaration that he must militarily combat an &quot;empire of lies&quot; which was created by the U.S. in order to justify its desire to suffocate Russia.

In a 2021 story, the business-centered publication Bloomberg News stated that the rise of ultranationalist viewpoints in China, particularly in terms of those who advocate extremism on social media, presents a direct challenge to the current government of the nation, with CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping facing opposition to his attempts to set forth climate change based economic reforms in relation to greenhouse gases. Chinese political activists have asserted, according to the publication, a conspiracy theory that said that the reforms represent some kind of capitulation to foreign interests at the expense of individual Chinese people. Environmentalist policies have come into being in a complex fashion inside China, facing complicated opinions among many.

Under the rule of Mohammed bin Salman, who formally serves as a &quot;Crown Prince&quot;, Saudi Arabia has been described by multiple analysts as embracing ultranationalism in a shift away from the government&#x27;s previous reliance on Islamist political arguments. For instance, the news agency France 24 stated in a 2019 report that while &quot;promoting ultra-nationalism&quot; the Crown Prince &quot;has introduced glitzy concerts, magic shows and sporting extravaganzas with thumping after parties.&quot; A 2019 article by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; likewise described the ideological shift as &quot;a wave&quot; that the leader had &quot;swept across the kingdom&quot;.

== Ultranationalist terrorism ==


Arising out of strident Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism, with differing ethnic and religious groups placed at odds, the militant faction known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) orchestrated a decades long campaign of terrorism in the country of Sri Lanka, which is inside of the Indian Ocean and has been influenced by broader socio-political trends. Both ultranationalism as well as revolutionary ideologies aligned against capitalist policies influencing Sri Lankan life motivated the organization as it undertook a series of violent actions against both the national government and the supporters of the state. These attacks have collectively caused a large number of civilian deaths. For example, the Anuradhapura massacre committed by the LTTE on May 14, 1985 resulted in the killing of over one-hundred individuals inside of a holy city associated with local Buddhist worshippers. The militants deliberately targeted civilians socializing outdoors, such as by executing an elderly florist serving religious travelers.

In the context of the LTTE&#x27;s militant campaign, the academic publication &quot;Journal of Hate Studies&quot; found in a 2006 analysis that &quot;ultranationalism subordinates all other claims for loyalty and allegiance&quot; given that &quot;[l]oyalty to the nation transcends loyalty to the family.&quot; Thus, &quot;this notion explains the commitment of Tamil Tiger nationalists to [even] engage in suicide missions&quot;, since the journal stated that &quot;[u]ltranationalist loyalty demands the willingness to sacrifice the self.&quot; In conclusion, the publication reported that an &quot;extremist nationalist claim not only is understood as supreme, but [it] also is presented as urgent&quot; and then demands political activists &quot;must engage in preventive measures, such as ethnic cleansing or deportation&quot;.

The assassination of Pavlos Fyssas in September 2013, a hip-hop musician with left-wing views, from stabbing wounds to the heart and ribs that occurred after his surrounding by multiple dozen Golden Dawn militants triggered widespread outrage at the Greek political organization. The ultranationalist attack occurred in an Athens suburb and resulted in a police crackdown with several arrests. The then Ministry of Public Order and Citizen Protection, Nikos Dendias, remarked that the &quot;abominable murder&quot; done &quot;by an attacker sympathizing with Golden Dawn&quot; publicly &quot;illustrates, in the clearest way, the intentions of neo-Nazism&quot;.

The organization held, at the time, 18 of the 300 seats in the Hellenic Parliament. Characterized as an extremist political party directly adapting the beliefs of Adolf Hitler, support for its ultranationalism increased in the context of the debate over spiking immigration to Greece. However, the Greek legal system ultimately investigated the assassination and other acts of violence with the outcome of an October 2020 verdict by the Athens Court of Appeals wiping out the party&#x27;s leadership through prison sentences. Looking back, the British publication &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in 2021, &quot;Golden Dawn hit squads sowed terror on the streets, targeting immigrants, left[-]wing trade unionists[,] and other perceived opponents before a party operative ultimately confessed to the killing of Fyssas.&quot;

== Portrayals of ultranationalism in fiction ==
The action film &quot;Air Force One&quot; features a terrorist mastermind named Egor Korshunov, played by actor Gary Oldman, who kidnaps a set of hostages including the U.S. President by hijacking the leader&#x27;s plane. Korshunov seeks revenge due to the arrest of Kazakh dictator Ivan Radek, played by actor Jürgen Prochnow, and the militant became an ultranationalist radical after having formerly served as a Soviet soldier. In February 2022, the U.S. armed forces related website Military.com published a story labeling the character as one of the best &quot;Russian Movie Villains&quot; in American cinematic history. As well, writer Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; lauded the nature of Oldman&#x27;s &quot;fanatical&quot; character, McCarthy stating that &quot;in his second malevolent lead of the summer, after &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, [he] registers strongly as a veteran of the Afghan campaign pushed to desperate lengths to newly ennoble his country.&quot;

The Israeli movie &quot;Incitement&quot; portrayals a fictionalized account of ultranationalist activist and murderer Yigal Amir. The production details his personal life prior to his assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Film critic Nell Minow stated that the killer, played by actor Yehuda Nahari, projects a superficial charm and skill at persuasion while at the same time failing to generate audience sympathy due to his true nature still coming out. Amir seeing himself in a callous, &quot;instrumentalist&quot; way as a living weapon up to and including Rabin&#x27;s assassination feeds into, in Minow&#x27;s opinion, the movie&#x27;s &quot;chillingly&quot; thriller-type quality. Writer Carla Hay of CultureMixOnline.com also found Nahari&#x27;s performance to be a compelling portrayal of a sociopath in film, with much left to audience interpretations.

The 2007 video game &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot; gained notice for its depiction of a civil war inside Russia between the country&#x27;s government and an ultranationalist faction. Its sequels, &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot; (2009) and &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&quot; (2011), are set in the aftermath of an ultranationalist coup d&#x27;état in Russia and a subsequent war involving the American military. Militant leader Vladimir Makarov, a character in multiple games, notably declares at one point, &quot;Russia will take all of Europe, even if it must stand upon a pile of ashes.&quot;

<doc id="166281" wikidata="Q145877" url="?curid=166281" title="Tuanku Imam Bonjol">
<text>Tuanku Imam Bonjol (1772 – 6 November 1864), also known as Muhammad Syahab, Peto Syarif, and Malim Basa, was one of the most popular leaders of the Padri movement in Central Sumatra. He was declared a National Hero of Indonesia.

==Biography==
Tuanku Imam Bonjol was born in Bonjol, Pasaman, West Sumatra. His parents name were Bayanuddin (father) and Hamatun (mother). His father is a Minangkabau cleric who came from Sungai Rimbang, Suliki, Limapuluh Koto. His mother is an Algerian who has settled in Morocco and migrated to Bonjol with her brother. 

Syarif was immersed in Islamic studies as he grew up, studying first from his father and later under various other Muslim theologians. After founding the state of Bonjol, he became involved in the Adat-Padri controversy as a Padri leader. The Padri movement, which has been compared to the Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah (Sunni) school of Islam in the now Saudi Arabia, was an effort to return the Islam of the area to the purity of its roots by removing local distortions like gambling, cockfighting, the use of opium and strong drink, tobacco, and so forth. It also opposed the powerful role of women in the matrilineal Minangkabau culture. The Adat, or traditionalist, position was that local custom that pre-dated the arrival of Islam should also be respected and followed.

Feeling their leadership position threatened, the traditionalists appealed to the Dutch for help in their struggle against the Padris. At first, the Dutch were not able to win militarily against the Padris because their resources were stretched thin by the Diponegoro resistance in Java. In 1824, the Dutch signed the Masang Agreement ending hostilities with the state of Bonjol.

Subsequently, however, once the Diponegoro resistance was suppressed, the Dutch attacked the state of Pandai Sikat in a renewed effort to gain control of West Sumatra. Despite valiant fighting by the Indonesians (by this time the traditionalists had realised they didn&#x27;t want to be ruled by the Dutch either and had joined forces with the Padris in their resistance), the overwhelming power of the Dutch military eventually prevailed. Syarif was captured in 1832 but escaped after three months to continue the struggle from his tiny fortress in Bonjol.

After three years of siege, the Dutch finally managed to sack Bonjol on 16 August 1837. Through a negotiation ruse, the Dutch again captured Syarif and exiled him, first to Cianjur in West Java, then to Ambon, and later to Manado in Sulawesi. He died on 6 November 1864, at the age of 92 and is buried in Sulawesi. The site of his grave is marked by a Minangkabau (West Sumatran) house.

== Controversy over National Hero Title ==
Imam Bonjol and the Padri Movement have been accused of Wahhabism and of conducting crime against Batak people according to some Batak historians, specifically Mangaradja Onggang Parlindungan and international sources. Some Batak historians argued that Imam Bonjol does not deserve the National Hero title because of his past actions and his ideological motives. Reports from Dutch colonial and Batak lore about the notoriety of Imam Bonjol&#x27;s movement have been the source for almost a century of discussion among experts on the role of Imam Bonjol in the past.

<doc id="166283" wikidata="Q2755022" url="?curid=166283" title="Dawn chorus (birds)">
<text>The dawn chorus is the outbreak of birdsong at the start of a new day. In temperate countries this is most noticeable in spring when the birds are either defending a breeding territory, trying to attract a mate or calling in the flock. In a given location it is common for different species to do their dawn singing at different times.

In some territories where bird life is extensive and birds are vocal, the sound of a dawn chorus may make it difficult for humans to sleep in the early morning.

==Timing==
In a 2007 study of the Ecuadorian forest, it was determined that birds perching higher in the trees and birds with larger eyes tend to sing first. This may be due to differences in the amount of light perceived by the birds.

Moller used a play-back technique to investigate the effects of singing by the black wheatear (&quot;Oenanthe leucura&quot;) on the behaviour of both conspecifics and heterospecifics. It was found that singing increased in both groups in response to the wheatear. Moller suggested the dawn (and dusk) chorus of bird song may be augmented by social facilitation due to the singing of conspecifics as well as heterospecifics.

==International Dawn Chorus Day ==
An annual International Dawn Chorus Day is held on the first Sunday in May when the public are encouraged to rise early to listen to bird song at organised events. The first ever was held at Moseley Bog in Birmingham, England, in 1987, organized by the Urban Wildlife Trust (now The Wildlife Trust for Birmingham and the Black Country).

==New Zealand==
Early explorers and European settlers noted that the New Zealand forest had a loud dawn chorus. The dawn chorus is no longer as loud as it once was, owing to extensive loss of forests, the introduction of bird predators and competing species such as wasps. The bellbird and the tūī are two of the birds that would have formed part of the dawn chorus since they have a vocal and melodious call.

==United Kingdom==
In the UK the dawn chorus may begin as early as 3 a.m. in early summer.

==United States==
The dawn chorus may also be heard in the United States.

<doc id="166287" wikidata="Q670075" url="?curid=166287" title="Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza">
<text>Hans Heinrich August Gábor Tasso Thyssen-Bornemisza de Kászon, Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza (13 April 1921 – 27 April 2002), was a Dutch-born Swiss industrialist and art collector. A member of the Thyssen family, he had a Hungarian title and was heir to a German fortune.

He was born to a German father and a Hungarian mother. His paternal grandfather was August Thyssen.

Thyssen lived in Lugano for most of his adult life. His fifth and last wife, Carmen &quot;Tita&quot; Cervera, is a former Miss Spain.

==Early life==
Thyssen-Bornemisza was born in Scheveningen, Netherlands, the son of Heinrich, Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza de Kászon de Impérfalva (Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany, 1875–Lugano, Switzerland, 1947) and his first wife, Margaret (Margit), Baroness Bornemisza de Kászon (Csetény, Veszprém, Hungary, 1887–Locarno, Switzerland, 1971). The Thyssen family&#x27;s fortune was built upon a steel empire. Heinrich Thyssen, after studying chemistry in Berlin, Bonn and Heidelberg, and living for some years in London, where he possibly sought to enter the diplomatic career, settled in Hungary in 1905. In Budapest, he married the daughter of the king&#x27;s Hungarian chamberlain Gábor Bornemisza de Kászon et Impérfalva (Cluj-Napoca, Hungary (today Romania), 1859–Budapest, 1915) who, having no sons of his own, adopted Heinrich, the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary extending his father-in-law&#x27;s baronial title in the Hungarian nobility to Heinrich and his male-line descendants in 1907. Baroness Margit Bornemisza&#x27;s mother was Mathilde Louise Price (Wilmington, Delaware, 1865–Locarno, 1959) and her parental grandparents were the Baron Albert Bornemisza de Kászon (1832–1899) and the Countess Gabriella Kornis de Gönczruszka (1834–1902).

==Career==
With his father&#x27;s death in 1947, Thyssen-Bornemisza inherited&quot; TBG (Thyssen-Bornemisza Group) Holdings N.V.&quot;, a business empire that included banking, naval construction (Bremer Vulkan) and large parts of Rotterdam harbor, as well as a major art collection with hundreds of paintings of European masters from between the 14th and the 19th centuries.

He bought more old masters, from Duccio to Francisco Goya; and fifteen years after his father&#x27;s death, he bought his first piece of modern art, a watercolor painting by Emil Nolde dated from between 1931 and 1935, starting the entry of 20th century&#x27;s paintings in the collection (including Pablo Picasso, Piet Mondrian, Edward Hopper, Jackson Pollock, Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud). His preference however went to German Expressionism, and he soon became a real expert in painting.

===Assets dispute===
As part of an attempt to dissolve a trust, thereby acquiring control of her third husband&#x27;s assets, Tita cast doubt on the paternity of Baron Georg Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, alleging that his father was actually Count Iván Batthyány de Német-Ujvár (1910–1985), the husband of Thyssen&#x27;s sister, Countess Margit Batthyány (1911–1989). However, a settlement was reached between the parties before the baron&#x27;s death, which brought to a &quot;peaceable&quot; conclusion the wrangling over control of the vast Thyssen art collection, which is to remain in Spain, Hans Heinrich having been the founder of the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid. One of the paintings in the museum, &quot;Rue Saint-Honoré in the Afternoon, Effect of Rain&quot; by Camille Pissarro, belonged to a Jewish couple who were forced to give it to the German government in exchange for an exit visa to the United Kingdom shortly after Kristallnacht in 1939. By 2015, their descendants had filed a lawsuit against the museum, on the grounds that it was stolen by the Nazis. Nevertheless, in 2019 the District Court of the State of California ruled that the law applicable to this case is Spanish law and, accordingly, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection Foundation in Madrid is the rightful owner of the painting, a ruling that was ratified in January 2024.

==Personal life==
He first married at Castagnola-Cassarate, 1 August 1946, Austrian Princess Teresa Amalia Franziska Elisabeth Maria of Lippe-Weissenfeld (21 July 1925 – 16 July 2008), daughter of Prince Alfred of Lippe-Weissenfeld (1896–1970) and Countess Franziska of Schönborn-Buchheim (1902–1987). She belonged to the cadet branch of House of Lippe who had been reigning princes until the fall of the German Empire in 1918 (following their divorce on 14 May 1954, she married secondly in 1960 Prince Friedrich Maximilian zu Fürstenberg (1926–1969), by whom she had further issue). Their only son was:

<text>The ( 300 BC – 300 AD) is a period in Japanese history that started in the late Neolithic period in Japan, continued through the Bronze Age, and towards its end crossed into the Iron Age.

Since the 1980s, scholars have argued that a period previously classified as a transition from the Jōmon period should be reclassified as Early Yayoi. The date of the beginning of this transition is controversial, with estimates ranging from the 10th to the 3rd centuries BC.

The period is named after the neighbourhood of Tokyo where archaeologists first uncovered artifacts and features from that era in the late 19th century. Distinguishing characteristics of the Yayoi period include the appearance of new Yayoi pottery styles, improved carpentry and architecture, and the start of an intensive rice agriculture in paddy fields. A hierarchical social class structure dates from this period and has its origin in China. Techniques in metallurgy based on the use of bronze and iron were also introduced from China via Korea to Japan in this period.

The Yayoi followed the Jōmon period and Yayoi culture flourished in a geographic area from southern Kyūshū to northern Honshū. Archaeological evidence supports the idea that during this time, an influx of farmers (Yayoi people) from the Korean Peninsula to Japan overwhelmed and mixed with the native predominantly hunter-gatherer population (Jōmon).

== Features ==
The Yayoi period is, generally, accepted to date from circa 300 BC to 300 AD. However, although highly controversial, radiocarbon evidence, from organic samples attached to pottery shards, may suggest a date up to 500 years earlier, between ca. 1000 BC and 800 BC. During this period, Japan largely transitioned to a more settled, agricultural society, adopting methods of farming and crop production that were introduced to the country (initially in the Kyūshū region) from Korea.

The earliest archaeological evidence of the Yayoi Period is found on northern Kyūshū, though that is still debated. Yayoi culture quickly spread to the main island of Honshū, mixing with native Jōmon culture. 
The name Yayoi is borrowed from a location in Tokyo, where pottery of the Yayoi period was first found. Yayoi pottery was simply decorated and produced, using the same coiling technique previously used in Jōmon pottery. Yayoi craft specialists made bronze ceremonial bells (&quot;dōtaku&quot;), mirrors, and weapons. By the 1st century AD, Yayoi people began using iron agricultural tools and weapons.

As the Yayoi population increased, the society became more stratified and complex. They wove textiles, lived in permanent farming villages, and constructed buildings with wood and stone. They also accumulated wealth through land ownership and the storage of grain. Such factors promoted the development of distinct social classes. Contemporary Chinese sources described the people as having tattoos and other bodily markings which indicated differences in social status. Yayoi chiefs, in some parts of Kyūshū, appear to have sponsored, and politically manipulated, trade in bronze and other prestige objects. That was made possible by the introduction of an irrigated, wet-rice agriculture from the Yangtze estuary in southern China via the Ryukyu Islands or Korean Peninsula. 

Direct comparisons between Jōmon and Yayoi skeletons show that the two peoples are noticeably distinguishable. The Jōmon tended to be shorter, with relatively longer forearms and lower legs, more deep-set eyes, shorter and wider faces, and much more pronounced facial topography. They also have strikingly raised brow ridges, noses, and nose bridges. Yayoi people, on the other hand, averaged taller, with shallow-set eyes, high and narrow faces, and flat brow ridges and noses. By the Kofun period, almost all skeletons excavated in Japan except those of the Ainu are of the Yayoi type with some having small Jōmon admixture, resembling those of modern-day Japanese.

== History ==

===Origin of the Yayoi people===

The origin of Yayoi culture and the Yayoi people has long been debated. The earliest archaeological sites are Itazuke or Nabata in the northern part of Kyūshū. Contacts between fishing communities on this coast and the southern coast of Korea date from the Jōmon period, as witnessed by the exchange of trade items such as fishhooks and obsidian. During the Yayoi period, cultural features from Korea and China arrived in this area at various times over several centuries, and later spread to the south and east. This was a period of mixture between immigrants and the indigenous population, and between new cultural influences and existing practices.

Chinese influence was obvious in the bronze and copper weapons, dōkyō, dōtaku, as well as irrigated paddy rice cultivation. Three major symbols of Yayoi culture are the bronze mirror, the bronze sword, and the royal seal stone.

Between 1996 and 1999, a team led by Satoshi Yamaguchi, a researcher at Japan&#x27;s National Museum of Nature and Science, compared Yayoi remains found in Japan&#x27;s Yamaguchi and Fukuoka prefectures with those from China&#x27;s coastal Jiangsu province and found many similarities between the Yayoi and the Jiangsu remains.
Further links to the Korean Peninsula have been discovered, and several researchers have reported discoveries/evidence that strongly link the Yayoi culture to the southern part of the Korean Peninsula. Mark J. Hudson has cited archaeological evidence that included &quot;bounded paddy fields, new types of polished stone tools, wooden farming implements, iron tools, weaving technology, ceramic storage jars, exterior bonding of clay coils in pottery fabrication, ditched settlements, domesticated pigs, and jawbone rituals&quot;. The migrant transfusion from the Korean peninsula gains strength because Yayoi culture began on the north coast of Kyūshū, where Japan is closest to Korea. Yayoi pottery, burial mounds, and food preservation were discovered to be very similar to the pottery of southern Korea.
However, some scholars argue that the rapid increase of roughly four million people in Japan between the Jōmon and Yayoi periods cannot be explained by migration alone. They attribute the increase primarily to a shift from a hunter-gatherer to an agricultural diet on the islands, with the introduction of rice. It is quite likely that rice cultivation and its subsequent deification allowed for a slow and gradual population increase. Regardless, there is archaeological evidence that supports the idea that there was an influx of farmers from the continent to Japan that absorbed or overwhelmed the native hunter-gatherer population.

Some pieces of Yayoi pottery clearly show the influence of Jōmon ceramics. In addition, the Yayoi lived in the same type of pit or circular dwelling as that of the Jōmon. Other examples of commonality are chipped stone tools for hunting, bone tools for fishing, shells in bracelet construction, and lacquer decoration for vessels and accessories.

According to several linguists, Japonic or proto-Japonic was present on large parts of the southern Korean peninsula. These Peninsular Japonic languages, now extinct, were eventually replaced by Koreanic languages. Similarly Whitman suggests that the Yayoi are not related to the proto-Koreans but that they (the Yayoi) were present on the Korean peninsula during the Mumun pottery period. According to him and several other researchers, Japonic/proto-Japonic arrived in the Korean peninsula around 1500 BC and was brought to the Japanese archipelago by Yayoi wet-rice farmers at some time between 700 and 300 BC. Whitman and Miyamoto associate Japonic as the language family of both Mumun and Yayoi cultures. Several linguists believe that speakers of Koreanic/proto-Koreanic arrived in the Korean Peninsula at some time after the Japonic/proto-Japonic speakers and coexisted with these peoples (i.e. the descendants of both the Mumun and Yayoi cultures) and possibly assimilated them. Both Koreanic and Japonic had prolonged influence on each other and a later founder effect diminished the internal variety of both language families.

=== Languages ===

Most linguists and archaeologists agree that the Japonic language family was introduced to and spread through the archipelago during the Yayoi period.

===Emergence of &quot;Wo&quot; in Chinese history texts ===

The earliest written records about people in Japan are from Chinese sources from this period. Wo, the pronunciation of an early Chinese name for Japan, was mentioned in 57 AD; the Na state of Wo received a golden seal from the Emperor Guangwu of the Later Han dynasty. This event was recorded in the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; compiled by Fan Ye in the 5th century. The seal itself was discovered in northern Kyūshū in the 18th century. Wo was also mentioned in 257 in the &quot;Wei zhi&quot;, a section of the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; compiled by the 3rd-century scholar Chen Shou.

Early Chinese historians described Wo as a land of hundreds of scattered tribal communities rather than the unified land with a 700-year tradition as laid out in the 8th-century work &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, a partly mythical, partly historical account of Japan which dates the foundation of the country at 660 BC. Archaeological evidence also suggests that frequent conflicts between settlements or statelets broke out in the period. Many excavated settlements were moated or built at the tops of hills. Headless human skeletons discovered in Yoshinogari site are regarded as typical examples of finds from the period. In the coastal area of the Inland Sea, stone arrowheads are often found among funerary objects.

Third-century Chinese sources reported that the Wa people lived on raw fish, vegetables, and rice served on bamboo and wooden trays, clapped their hands in worship (something still done in Shinto shrines today), and built earthen-grave mounds. They also maintained vassal-master relations, collected taxes, had provincial granaries and markets, and observed mourning. Society was characterised by violent struggles.

===Yamataikoku===

The &quot;Wei Zhi&quot; (), which is part of the Records of the three Kingdoms, first mentions Yamataikoku and Queen Himiko in the 3rd century. According to the record, Himiko assumed the throne of Wa, as a spiritual leader, after a major civil war. Her younger brother was in charge of the affairs of state, including diplomatic relations with the Chinese court of the Kingdom of Wei. When asked about their origins by the Wei embassy, the people of Wa claimed to be descendants of the Taibo of Wu, a historic figure of the Wu Kingdom around the Yangtze Delta of China.

For many years, the location of Yamataikoku and the identity of Queen Himiko have been subject of research. Two possible sites, Yoshinogari in Saga Prefecture and Makimuku in Nara Prefecture have been suggested. Recent archaeological research in Makimuku suggests that Yamataikoku was located in the area. Some scholars assume that the Hashihaka kofun in Makimuku was the tomb of Himiko. Its relation to the origin of the Yamato polity in the following Kofun period is also under debate.

<text>Minangkabau people (; Indonesian or Malay: &quot;Orang Minangkabau&quot;; Jawi: ), also known as Minang, are an Austronesian ethnic group native to the Minangkabau Highlands of West Sumatra, Indonesia. The Minangkabau&#x27;s West Sumatera homelands was the seat of the Pagaruyung Kingdom, believed by early historians to have been the cradle of the Malay race, and the location of the Padri War (1821 to 1837).

Minangkabau are the ethnic majority in West Sumatra and Negeri Sembilan. Minangkabau are also a recognised minority in other parts of Indonesia as well as Malaysia, Singapore, and the Netherlands.

==Etymology==
There are several possible etymologies for the term Minangkabau (Minangkabau: &quot;Minang&quot; Jawi script: منڠ). While the word &quot;kabau&quot; undisputedly translates to &quot;buffalo&quot;, the word &quot;minang&quot; is traditionally known as the &quot;pinang&quot; fruit (areca nut) chewed with &quot;sirih&quot; (betel) leaves. But there is also a folklore that mention that term &quot;Minangkabau&quot; came from a popular legend that was derived from a territorial dispute between a people and a prince from a neighbouring region. To avoid the battle, the local people proposed a fight to the death between two water buffaloes (&quot;kabau&quot;) to settle the dispute. The prince agreed and produced the largest, meanest, most aggressive buffalo. The villagers on other hand produced a hungry baby calf with its small horns ground to be as sharp as knives. Seeing the adult buffalo across the field, the calf ran forward, hoping for milk. The big buffalo saw no threat in the baby buffalo and paid no attention to it, looking around for a worthy opponent. But when the baby thrust his head under the big bull&#x27;s belly, looking for an udder, the sharpened horns punctured and killed the bull giving the villagers their victory (&quot;menang&quot;, hence &quot;minang kabau&quot;: &quot;victors of the buffalo&quot; which eventually became &quot;Minangkabau&quot;). That legend, however, is known to be a mere tale and that the word &quot;minang&quot; is too far from the word &quot;menang&quot; which means &#x27;win&#x27;.

The legend however has its rebuttals as the word &#x27;minang&#x27; refers to the consumption of areca nut (&quot;pinang&quot;), yet there has not been any popular explanation on the word &#x27;minang&#x27; that relates the aforementioned action to the word for &quot;water buffalo&quot;.

The first mention of the name Minangkabau as Minanga Tamwan, is in the late 7th century Kedukan Bukit inscription, describing Sri Jayanasa&#x27;s sacred journey from Minanga Tamwan accompanied with 20,000 soldiers heading to Matajap and conquering several areas in the southern of Sumatra.

==History==

The Minangkabau language is a member of the Austronesian language family, and is closest to the Malay language, though when the two languages split from a common ancestor and the precise historical relationship between Malay and Minangkabau culture is not known. Until the 20th century the majority of the Sumatran population lived in the highlands. The highlands are well suited for human habitation, with plentiful fresh water, fertile soil, a cool climate, and valuable commodities. It is probable that wet rice cultivation evolved in the Minangkabau Highlands long before it appeared in other parts of Sumatra, and predates significant foreign contact.

Adityawarman, a follower of Tantric Buddhism with ties to the Singhasari and Majapahit kingdoms of Java, is believed to have founded a kingdom in the Minangkabau highlands at Pagaruyung and ruled between 1347 and 1375. The establishment of a royal system seems to have involved conflict and violence, eventually leading to a division of villages into one of two systems of tradition, &quot;Bodi-Caniago system&quot; based on Adat Perpatih and &quot;Koto-Piliang system&quot; based on Adat Temenggung, the latter having overt allegiances to royalty. By the 16th century, the time of the next report after the reign of Adityawarman, royal power had been split into three recognised reigning kings. They were the King of the World (&quot;Raja Alam&quot;), the King of Adat (&quot;Raja Adat&quot;), and the King of Religion (&quot;Raja Ibadat&quot;), and collectively they were known as the Kings of the Three Seats (&quot;Rajo Tigo Selo&quot;). The Minangkabau kings were charismatic or magical figures, but did not have much authority over the conduct of village affairs.
Around the 16th century, the Minangkabau started to convert to Islam. The first contact between the Minangkabau and western nations occurred with the 1529 voyage of Jean Parmentier to Sumatra. The Dutch East India Company first acquired gold at Pariaman in 1651, but later moved south to Padang to avoid interference from the Acehnese occupiers. In 1663 the Dutch agreed to protect and liberate local villages from the Acehnese in return for a trading monopoly, and as a result setup trading posts at Painan and Padang. Until early in the 19th century the Dutch remained content with their coastal trade of gold and produce, and made no attempt to visit the Minangkabau highlands. As a result of conflict in Europe, the British occupied Padang from 1781 to 1784 during the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, and again from 1795 to 1819 during the Napoleonic Wars.

Late in the 18th century the gold supply which provided the economic base for Minangkabau royalty began to be exhausted. Around the same time other parts of the Minangkabau economy had a period of unparalleled expansion as new opportunities for the export of agricultural commodities arose, particularly with coffee which was in very high demand. A civil war started in 1803 with the &quot;Padri&quot; fundamentalist Islamic group in conflict with the traditional syncretic groups, elite families and Pagaruyung royals. As a result of a treaty with a number of penghulu and representatives of the Minangkabau royal family, Dutch forces made their first attack on a Padri village in April 1821. The first phase of the war ended in 1825 when the Dutch signed an agreement with the Padri leader Tuanku Imam Bonjol to halt hostilities, allowing them to redeploy their forces to fight the Java War. When fighting resumed in 1832, the reinforced Dutch troops were able to more effectively attack the Padri. The main centre of resistance was captured in 1837, Tuanku Imam Bonjol was captured and exiled soon after, and by the end of the next year the war was effectively over.
With the Minangkabau territories now under the control of the Dutch, transportation systems were improved and economic exploitation was intensified. New forms of education were introduced, allowing some Minangkabau to take advantage of a modern education system. The 20th century marked a rise and cultural and political nationalism, culminating in the demand for Indonesian independence. Later rebellions against the Dutch occupation occurred such as the 1908 Anti-Tax Rebellion and the 1927 Communist uprising. During World War II the Minangkabau territories were occupied by the Japanese, and when the Japanese surrendered in August 1945 Indonesia proclaimed independence. The Dutch attempts to regain control of the area were ultimately unsuccessful and in 1949 the Minangkabau territories became part of Indonesia as the province of Central Sumatra.

In February 1958, dissatisfaction with the centralist and communist-leaning policies of the Sukarno administration triggered a revolt which was centred in the Minangkabau region of Sumatra, with rebels proclaiming the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI) in Bukittinggi. The Indonesian military invaded West Sumatra in April 1958 and had recaptured major towns within the next month. A period of guerrilla warfare ensued, but most rebels had surrendered by August 1961. In the years following, West Sumatra was like an occupied territory with Javanese officials occupying most senior civilian, military and police positions. The policies of centralisation continued under the Suharto regime. The national government legislated to apply the Javanese &quot;desa&quot; village system throughout Indonesia, and in 1983 the traditional Minangkabau &quot;nagari&quot; village units were split into smaller &quot;jorong&quot; units, thereby destroying the traditional village social and cultural institutions. In the years following the downfall of the Suharto regime decentralisation policies were implemented, giving more autonomy to provinces, thereby allowing West Sumatra to reinstitute the &quot;nagari&quot; system.

==Historiography==

The traditional historiography of the Minangkabau tells of the development of the Minangkabau World (&quot;alam Minangkabau&quot;) and its &quot;adat&quot;. These stories are derived from an oral history which was transmitted between generations before the Minangkabau had a written language. The first Minangkabau are said to have arrived by ship and landed on Mount Marapi when it was no bigger than the size of an egg, which protruded from a surrounding body of water. After the waters receded the Minangkabau proliferated and dispersed to the slopes and valleys surrounding the volcano, a region called the &quot;darek&quot;. The &quot;darek&quot; is composed of three &quot;luhak&quot; – Tanah Datar, Agam and Limapuluh Koto. The &quot;tambo&quot; claims the ship was sailed by a descendant of Alexander the Great (&quot;Iskandar Zulkarnain&quot;).
A division in Minangkabau &quot;adat&quot; into two systems is said to be the result of conflict between two half-brothers Datuak Katumangguangan and Datuak Parpatiah nan Sabatang, who were the leaders who formulated the foundations of Minangkabau &quot;adat&quot;. The former accepted Adityawarman, a prince from Majapahit, as a king while the latter considered him a minister, and a civil war ensued. The Bodi Caniago/Adat perpatih system formulated by Datuak Parpatiah nan Sabatang is based upon egalitarian principles with all &quot;panghulu&quot; (clan chiefs) being equal while the Koto Piliang /Adat Katumangguangan system is more autocratic with there being a hierarchy of &quot;panghulu&quot;. Each village (&quot;nagari&quot;) in the &quot;darek&quot; was an autonomous &quot;republic&quot;, and governed independently of the Minangkabau kings using one of the two &quot;adat&quot; systems. After the &quot;darek&quot; was settled, new outside settlements were created and ruled using the Koto Piliang system by &quot;rajo&quot; who were representatives of the king.

==Culture==
The Minangkabau have large corporate descent groups, but they traditionally reckon descent matrilineally. A young boy, for instance, has his primary responsibility to his mother&#x27;s and sisters&#x27; clans. It is considered &quot;customary&quot; and ideal for married sisters to remain in their parental home, with their husbands having a sort of visiting status. Not everyone lives up to this ideal, however. In the 1990s, anthropologist Evelyn Blackwood studied a relatively conservative village in Sumatra Barat where only about 22 percent of the households were &quot;matrihouses&quot;, consisting of a mother and a married daughter or daughters. Nonetheless, there is a shared ideal among Minangkabau in which sisters and unmarried lineage members try to live close to one another or even in the same house.

Landholding is one of the crucial functions of the &quot;suku&quot; (female lineage unit). Because Minangkabau men, like Acehnese men, often migrate to seek experience, wealth, and commercial success, the women&#x27;s kin group is responsible for maintaining the continuity of the family and the distribution and cultivation of the land. These family groups, however, are typically led by a &quot;penghulu&quot; (headman), elected by groups of lineage leaders. With the agrarian base of the Minangkabau economy in decline, the suku—as a landholding unit—has also been declining somewhat in importance, especially in urban areas. Indeed, the position of penghulu is not always filled after the death of the incumbent, particularly if lineage members are not willing to bear the expense of the ceremony required to install a new penghulu.

The Minangkabau (in short Minang) are also known for their devotion to Islam. A dominant majority of both males and females pray five times a day, fast during the month of Ramadan, and express the desire to make the holy pilgrimage (Hajj) to Mecca at least once in their lifetime. Each Minangkabau neighbourhood has a &quot;Musalla&quot;, which means &quot;a temporary place of prayer&quot; in Arabic. In the neighbourhood &quot;Musalla&quot;, men and women pray together, although separated into their respective gender-designated sections. A high percentage of women and girls wear the headscarf.
As early as the age of 7, boys traditionally leave their homes and live in a &quot;surau&quot; (traditionally: the house of men of a village where the boys learn from older men reading, reciting qur&#x27;an, simple math, and other survival skills) to learn religious and cultural (adat) teachings. At the surau during night time (after the Isyak prayers), these youngsters are taught the traditional Minangkabau art of self-defence, called as Silek, or Silat in Malay. When they are teenagers, they are encouraged to leave their hometown to learn in schools or through experiences outside of their hometown so that, as adults, they can return home wise and &#x27;useful&#x27; to society and are able to contribute their thinking and experience to run the family or &quot;nagari&quot; (hometown) when they sit as members of the &#x27;council of maternal uncles and maternal granduncles&#x27; (ninik-mamak). This tradition has created Minang communities in many Indonesian cities and towns, which nevertheless are still tied closely to their homeland; a state in Malaysia named Negeri Sembilan especially is heavily influenced by Minang culture because Negeri Sembilan was originally Minangkabau&#x27;s colony. By acquiring property and education through merantau experience, a young man can attempt to influence his own destiny in positive ways.
Increasingly, married couples go off on merantau; in such situations, the woman&#x27;s role tends to change. When married couples reside in urban areas or outside the Minangkabau region and a Minang woman marries a non-Minang man, the woman will rely on the protection provided by the husband more than that of her council of uncles. Because in Minang culture marriage is merely a &#x27;commitment of two people&#x27; and not at all a &#x27;union&#x27;, there is no stigma attached to divorce. The Minangkabau were prominent among the intellectual figures in the Indonesian independence movement. Not only were they strongly embedded themselves surrounding Islamic traditions – which counteracted the influence of the Protestant Dutch – they also had a sense of cultural pride just as like every other Sumatran especially with their traditional belief of egalitarianism of &quot;Standing as tall, sitting as low&quot; (that no body stand or sit on an increased stage). They also speak a language closely related to the Malay variant spoken in newly formed Indonesia, which was considerably freer of hierarchical connotations than Javanese. The tradition of merantau also meant that the Minangkabau developed a cosmopolitan bourgeoisie that readily adopted and promoted the ideas of an emerging nation-state. Due to their culture that stresses the importance of learning, Minang people are over-represented in the educated professions in Indonesia, with many ministers from Minang.

&quot;Adat&quot; derives in part from the ancient animist and buddhist belief system of the Minangkabau, which existed before the arrival of Islam to Sumatra. When precisely the religion spread across the island and was adopted by the Minangkabau is unclear, though it probably arrived in West Sumatra around the 16th century. It is &quot;adat&quot; that guides matrilineal inheritance, and though it seems that such a tradition might conflict with the precepts of Islam, the Minangnese insist that it does not. To accommodate both, the Minangkabau make a distinction between high and low inheritance. &quot;High inheritance&quot; is the property, including the home and land, which passes among women. &quot;Low inheritance&quot; is what a father passes to his children out of his professional earnings. This latter inheritance follows Islamic law, a complex system which dictates, in part, that sons get twice as much as daughters.

===Ceremonies and festivals===

Minangkabau ceremonies and festivals include:
* &quot;Turun mandi&quot; – baby blessing ceremony
* &quot;Sunat rasul&quot; – circumcision ceremony
* &quot;Baralek&quot; – wedding ceremony
* &quot;Batagak pangulu&quot; – clan leader inauguration ceremony. Other clan leaders, all relatives in the same clan and all villagers in the region are invited. The ceremony lasts for seven days or more.
* &quot;Turun ka sawah&quot; – community work ceremony
* &quot;Manyabik&quot; – harvesting ceremony
* &quot;Hari Rayo&quot; – the local observance of Eid al-Fitr
* Adoption ceremony
* Adat ceremony
* Funeral ceremony
* Wild boar hunt ceremony
* &quot;Maanta pabukoan&quot; – sending food to mother-in-law for Ramadan

* &quot;Tabuik&quot; – local Mourning of Muharram in the coastal village of Pariaman
* &quot;Tanah Ta Sirah&quot;, inaugurate a new datuk when the old one died in the few hours (no need to proceed to the batagak pangulu, but the clan must invite all datuk in the region.
* &quot;Mambangkik Batang Tarandam&quot;, inaugurate a new datuk when the old one died in the past 10 or 50 years and even more, attendance in the Batagak Pangulu ceremony is mandatory.

===Performing arts===

Traditional Minangkabau music includes &quot;saluang jo dendang,&quot; which consists of singing to the accompaniment of a bamboo flute and gong-chime music. Dances include the (plate dance), &quot;tari payung&quot; (umbrella dance), &quot;tari indang&quot; (also known as or ), and &quot;tari pasambahan&quot;. Demonstrations of the martial art are performed. &quot;Pidato adat&quot; are ceremonial orations performed at formal occasions.

&quot;Randai&quot; is a folk theatre tradition which incorporates music, singing, dance, drama and the &quot;silat&quot; martial art. &quot;Randai&quot; is usually performed for traditional ceremonies and festivals, and complex stories may span a number of nights. It is performed as a theatre-in-the-round to achieve an equality and unity between audience members and the performers. &quot;Randai&quot; performances are a synthesis of alternating martial arts dances, songs, and acted scenes. Stories are delivered by the acting and singing and are mostly based upon Minangkabau legends and folktales. &quot;Randai&quot; originated early in the 20th century out of fusion of local martial arts, storytelling and other performance traditions. Men originally played male and female characters in the story but, since the 1960s, women have participated.

===Crafts===

Particular Minangkabau villages specialise in cottage industries producing handicrafts such as woven sugarcane and reed purses, gold and silver jewellery using filigree and granulation techniques, woven songket textiles, wood carving, embroidery, pottery, and metallurgy.

===Cuisine===
The staple ingredients of the Minangkabau diet are rice, fish, coconut, green leafy vegetables and chili. Meat is mainly limited to special occasions, and beef and chicken are most commonly used. Pork is not &quot;halal&quot; and not consumed, while lamb, goat and game are rarely consumed for reasons of taste and availability. Spiciness is a characteristic of Minangkabau food: The most commonly used herbs and spices are chili, turmeric, ginger and galangal. Vegetables are consumed two or three times a day. Fruits are mainly seasonal, although fruits such as banana, papaya and citrus are continually available.

Three meals a day are typical with lunch being the most important, except during the fasting month of Ramadan when lunch is not eaten. Meals commonly consist of steamed rice, a hot fried dish and a coconut milk dish, with a little variation from breakfast to dinner. Meals are generally eaten from a plate using the fingers of the right hand. Snacks are more frequently eaten by people in urban areas than in villages. Western food has had little impact upon Minangkabau consumption and preference.
&quot;Rendang&quot; is a dish which is considered to be a characteristic of Minangkabau culture; it is cooked 4–5 times a year. This particular dish is one of the world&#x27;s renowned dish, especially after crowned the Best Food in CNN&#x27;s World&#x27;s 50 Best Foods in 2011 and 2017 by a CNN poll. Other characteristic dishes include &quot;Asam Padeh&quot;, &quot;Soto Padang&quot;, &quot;Sate Padang&quot;, &quot;Dendeng Balado&quot; (beef with chili sauce).

Food has a central role in the Minangkabau ceremonies which honour religious and life-cycle rites.

Minangkabau food is popular among Indonesians and restaurants are present throughout Indonesia. &quot;Nasi Padang&quot; restaurants, named after the capital of West Sumatra, are known for placing a variety of Minangkabau dishes on a customer&#x27;s table with rice and billing only for what is taken. &quot;Nasi Kapau&quot; is another restaurant variant which specialises in dishes using offal and tamarind to add a sourness to the spicy flavour.

===Architecture===

 (Minangkabau: &#x27;big house&#x27;) or (Minangkabau: &#x27;spired roof house&#x27;) are the traditional homes of the Minangkabau. The architecture, construction, internal and external decoration, and the functions of the house reflect the culture and values of the Minangkabau. A serves as a residence, a hall for family meetings, and for ceremonial activities. The &quot;rumah gadang&quot; is owned by the women of the family who live there – ownership is passed from mother to daughter.

The houses have dramatic curved roof structures with multi-tiered, upswept gables. They are also well distinguished by their rooflines which curve upward from the middle and end in points, in imitation of the upward-curving horns of the water buffalo that supposedly eked the people their name (i.e. &quot;victors of the buffalo&quot;). Shuttered windows are built into walls incised with profuse painted floral carvings. The term usually refers to the larger communal homes, however, smaller single residences share many of its architectural elements.

=== Oral traditions and literature ===
Minangkabau culture has a long history of oral traditions. One is the (ceremonial orations) which are performed by clan chiefs () at formal occasions such as weddings, funerals, adoption ceremonies, and inaugurations. These ceremonial orations consist of many forms including , aphorisms (), proverbs (), religious advice (, parables (), two-line aphorisms (), and similes ().

Minangkabau traditional folktales (&quot;kaba&quot;) consist of narratives that present the social and personal consequences of either ignoring or observing the ethical teachings and the norms embedded in the &quot;adat&quot;. The storyteller () recites the story in poetic or lyrical prose while accompanying himself on a .

A theme in Minangkabau folktales is the central role mothers and motherhood has in Minangkabau society, with the folktales &quot;Rancak di Labuah&quot; and &quot;Malin Kundang&quot; being two examples. &quot;Rancak di Labuah&quot; is about a mother who acts as teacher and adviser to her two growing children. Initially her son is vain and headstrong and only after her perseverance does he become a good son who listens to his mother. &quot;Malin Kundang&quot; is about the dangers of treating your mother badly. A sailor from a poor family voyages to seek his fortune, becoming rich and marrying. After refusing to recognise his elderly mother on his return home, being ashamed of his humble origins, he is cursed and dies when a storm ensues and turn him along with his ship to stone. The said stone is in Air Manis beach and is known by locals as &quot;batu Malin Kundang&quot;.

Other popular folktales also relate to the important role of the woman in Minangkabau society. In the &quot;Cindua Mato&quot; epic the woman is the source of wisdom, while in the &quot;Sabai nan Aluih&quot; she is a gentle girl who takes action. &quot;Cindua Mato&quot; (Staring Eye) is about the traditions of Minangkabau royalty. The story involves a mythical Minangkabau queen, Bundo Kanduang, who embodies the behaviours prescribed by &quot;adat&quot;. Cindua Mato, a servant of the queen, uses magic to defeat hostile outside forces and save the kingdom. &quot;Sabai nan Aluih&quot; (The genteel Sabai) is about a girl named Sabai who despite being famous for being a gentle girl with perfect wife skills, avenged the murder of her father by a powerful and evil ruler from a neighbouring village. After her father&#x27;s death, her cowardly elder brother refuses to confront the murderer and so Sabai decided to take matters into her own hands. She seeks out the murderer and shoots him in revenge.

===Matrilineage===
The Minangkabau are the largest matrilineal society in the world, with property, family name and land passing down from mother to daughter, while religious and political affairs are the responsibility of men, although some women also play important roles in these areas. This custom is called Lareh Bodi-Caniago and is known as adat perpatih in Malaysia. Today 4.2 million Minangs live in the homeland of West Sumatra.

As one of the world&#x27;s most populous (as well as politically and economically influential) matrilineal ethnicities, Minangkabau gender dynamics have been extensively studied by anthropologists. The &quot;adat&quot; (Minangkabau: &quot;Adaik&quot;) traditions have allowed Minangkabau women to hold a relatively advantageous position in their society compared to most patriarchal societies, because though they do not rule, they are at the center of their society.

==Language==
The Minangkabau language (&quot;Baso Minangkabau&quot;) is an Austronesian language belonging to the Malayic linguistic subgroup, which in turn belongs to the Malayo-Polynesian branch. The Negri Sembilan dialect of Malay used by people in the aforementioned state is closely related to it due to the fact many of the population are descendants of Minangkabau immigrants.

The language has a number of dialects and sub-dialects, but native Minangkabau speakers generally have no difficulty understanding the variety of dialects. The differences between dialects are mainly at the phonological level, though some lexical differences also exist. Minangkabau dialects are regional, consisting of one or more villages (), and usually correspond to differences in customs and traditions. Each sub-village () has its own sub-dialect consisting of subtle differences which can be detected by native speakers. The Padang dialect has become the lingua franca for people of different language regions.

The Minangkabau society has a diglossia situation, whereby they use their native language for everyday conversations, while the Malay language is used for most formal occasions, in education, and in writing, even to relatives and friends. The Minangkabau language was originally written using the Jawi script, an adapted Arabic alphabet. Romanization of the language dates from the 19th century, and a standardised official orthography of the language was published in 1976.

Despite widespread use of Malay in both Malaysia and Indonesia, they do have their own mother tongue; the Minangkabau language shares many similar words with Malay, yet it has a distinctive pronunciation and some grammatical differences rendering it unintelligible to Malay speakers.

==Customs and religion==
Prior to conversion to Islam, Buddhism, especially Tantric Buddhism was popular in the region. Buddhism in central Sumatra is attested by the Padang Roco Inscription, which states that an Avalokiteśvara was brought from Java to Dharmasraya, and this act brought great happiness to the people. Influential Buddhist kingdoms thrived in the area, including the Pagaruyung Kingdom and Melayu Kingdom. 

Animism had also been an important component of Minangkabau culture. Even after the penetration of Islam into Minangkabau society in the 16th century, animistic beliefs were not extinguished. In this belief system, people were said to have two souls, a real soul and a soul which can disappear called the &quot;semangat&quot;. &quot;Semangat&quot; represents the vitality of life and it is said to be possessed by all living creatures including animals and plants. An illness may be explained as the capture of the &quot;semangat&quot; by an evil spirit, and a shaman (&quot;pawang&quot;) may be consulted to conjure invisible forces and bring comfort to the family. Sacrificial offerings can be made to placate the spirits, and certain objects such as amulets are used as protection.

Until the rise of the Padri movement late in the 18th century, Islamic practices such as prayers, fasting and attendance at mosques had been weakly observed in the Minangkabau highlands. The Padri were inspired by the Wahhabi movement in Mecca, and sought to eliminate societal problems such as tobacco and opium smoking, gambling and general anarchy by ensuring the tenets of the quran were strictly observed. All Minangkabau customs allegedly in conflict with the quran were abolished. Although the Padri were eventually defeated by the Dutch, during this period the relationship between &quot;adat&quot; and religion was reformulated. Previously &quot;adat&quot; (customs) were said to be based upon appropriateness and propriety, but this was changed so that &quot;adat&quot; was more strongly based upon Islamic precepts.

The Minangkabau strongly profess Islam while at the same time also following their ethnic traditions, or &quot;adat&quot;. The Minangkabau &quot;adat&quot; was derived from hereditary wisdom before the arrival of Islam. The present relationship between Islam and &quot;adat&quot; is described in the saying &quot;traditions [&quot;adat&quot;] are founded upon the [Islamic] law, and the law founded upon the Qur&#x27;an&quot; (&quot;adat nan kawi&#x27;, syara&#x27; nan lazim&quot;).

With the Minangkabau highlands being the heartland of their culture, and with Islam likely entering the region from coast it is said that &quot;custom descended, religion ascended&quot; (&quot;adat manurun, syarak mandaki&quot;).

===Overseas Minangkabau===

Over half of the Minangkabau people can be considered overseas Minangkabaus. They make up the majority of the population of Negeri Sembilan, Naning (in Malaysia) as well as Pekanbaru (in Indonesia). They also form a significant minority in the populations of Jakarta, Bandung, Medan, Batam, Surabaya and Palembang in Indonesia as well as Kuala Lumpur, Malacca, Penang, Singapore and Brunei Darussalam in the rest of the Malay world. Minangkabaus have also emigrated as skilled professionals and merchants to the Netherlands, United States, Saudi Arabia and Australia. In the overseas (&quot;rantau&quot;), they have a reputation for being shrewd merchants. The matrilineal culture and economic conditions in West Sumatra have made the Minangkabau people one of the most mobile ethnic group in Maritime Southeast Asia.

For most of the Minangkabau people, wandering is an ideal way to reach maturity and success; as a consequence, they exercised great influence in the politics of many kingdom and states in Maritime Southeast Asia. Overseas Minangkabau are also great influence developing Indonesian, Malaysian, and Singaporean culture, mainly language, culinary, music, and martial art.

==Notable Minangkabau==

The Minangkabau are famous for their dedication to knowledge, as well as the widespread diaspora of their men throughout southeast Asia, the result being that Minangs have been disproportionately represented in positions of economic and political power throughout the region. The co-founder of the Republic of Indonesia, Mohammad Hatta, was a Minang, as were the first President of Singapore, Yusof bin Ishak, and the first Supreme Head of State or Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia, Tuanku Abdul Rahman.

The Minangkabau are known as a society that places top priority in high education and thus they are widespread across Indonesia and foreign countries in a variety of professions and expertise such as politicians, writers, scholars, teachers, journalists, and businesspeople. Outside West Sumatra, they are mostly an urban people, forming part of expanding Indonesia&#x27;s middle-class. Based on a relatively small population, Minangkabau is one of the most successful. According to &quot;Tempo&quot; magazine (2000 New Year special edition), six of the top ten most influential Indonesians of the 20th century were Minang. Three out of the four Indonesian founding fathers are Minangkabau people.

Many people of Minangkabau descent have held prominent positions in the Indonesian and Malay nationalist movements. In 1920–1960, the political leadership in Indonesian was replete with Minangkabau people, such as Mohammad Hatta a former Indonesian government prime minister and vice-president, Agus Salim a former Indonesian government minister, Tan Malaka international communist leader and founder of PARI and Murba, Sutan Sjahrir a former Indonesian government prime minister and founder of Socialist Party of Indonesia, Muhammad Natsir a former Indonesian government prime minister and founder of Masyumi, Assaat a former Indonesian president, and Abdul Halim a former Indonesian government prime minister. During the liberal democracy era, Minangkabau politician dominated Indonesian parliament and cabinets. They were diversely affiliated to all of the existing factions, such as Islamist, nationalist, socialist and communist.

Minangkabau writers and journalists have made significant contributions to modern Indonesian literature. These include authors Marah Roesli, Abdul Muis, Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, Idrus, Hamka, and Ali Akbar Navis; poets Muhammad Yamin, Chairil Anwar, and Taufik Ismail; and journalists Djamaluddin Adinegoro, Rosihan Anwar, and Ani Idrus. Many prominent Indonesian novels were written by Minangkabau writers and later influenced the development of modern Indonesian language.

Moreover, there are also significant number of Minangkabau people in the popular entertainment industry, such as movie directors Usmar Ismail and Nasri Cheppy; movie producer Djamaluddin Malik, screenwriter Arizal and Asrul Sani; actor and actress Soekarno M. Noer, Rano Karno, Camelia Malik, Eva Arnaz, Nirina Zubir, Titi Rajo Bintang, and Dude Herlino, as well as singers Fariz RM, Bunga Citra Lestari, Nazril Irham, Dorce Gamalama, Afgansyah Reza, Sherina Munaf, and Tulus. 

Nowadays, Minangkabau people have made significant contributions to Indonesia&#x27;s economic activities. Minangkabau businessmen are also notable in hospitality sector, media industry, healthcare, publisher, automotive, and textile trading. Some of them are industrialists include Hasyim Ning, Fahmi Idris, Abdul Latief, and Basrizal Koto.

Historically, Minangs had also settled outside West Sumatra, migrating as far as the south Philippines by the 14th century. Raja Bagindo was the leader of the forming polity in Sulu, Philippines, which later turned into the Sultanate of Sulu. The Minangkabaus migrated to the Malay peninsula in the 14th century and began to take control of the local politics. In 1773, Raja Melewar was appointed the first Yamtuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan.

Minangkabaus have filled many political positions in Malaysia and Singapore, namely the first President of Singapore, Yusof Ishak; the first Supreme Head of State (&quot;Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot;) of the Federation of Malaya, Tuanku Abdul Rahman; and many Malaysian government ministers, such as Aishah Ghani, Amirsham Abdul Aziz, Aziz Ishak, Ghazali Shafie, Rais Yatim and Khairy Jamaluddin. They are also known for their significant contributions to Malaysian and Singaporean culture, such as Zubir Said, who composed &quot;Majulah Singapura&quot; (the national anthem of Singapore); the Singaporean musician, Wandly Yazid; the Malaysian film director, U-Wei Haji Saari; the linguist, Zainal Abidin Ahmad; as well as business and economic activities, such as Mohamed Taib bin Haji Abdul Samad, Mokhzani Mahathir, Kamarudin Meranun and Tunku Tan Sri Abdullah.

Notable people of Minangkabau descent outside of the Malay world include member of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands, Rustam Effendi; Ahmad Khatib, the imam (head) of the Shafi&#x27;i school of law at &quot;Masjid al-Haram&quot;; and Khatib&#x27;s grandson Fouad Abdulhameed Alkhateeb as Saudi Arabian ambassador.

<text>Montagnards () is an umbrella term for the various indigenous peoples of the Central Highlands of Vietnam. The French term () signifies a mountain dweller, and is a carryover from the French colonial period in Vietnam. In Vietnamese, they are known by the term người Thượng (), although this term can also be applied to other minority ethnic groups in Vietnam. In modern Vietnam, both terms are archaic, and indigenous ethnic groups are referred to as &quot;đồng bào Tây Nguyên&quot; () or &quot;dân tộc thiểu số&quot; Tây Nguyên (). Earlier they were referred to pejoratively as mọi. Sometimes the term Degar (Đềga) is used for the group as well. Most of those living in the United States refer to themselves as Montagnards, while those living in Vietnam refer to themselves by their individual ethnic group.

The Montagnards are most covered in English-language scholarship for their participation in the Vietnam War, where they were heavily recruited by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam and its American and Australian allies. The Montagnards tended to be Christian at a higher proportion than that of the Viets, and the North Vietnamese were seen by some Montagnards as propounding a heavily centralized state that would not value Montagnard Degar local priorities or religious practices.

==History==


===Pre-colonial history===
In 1962, the population of the Montagnard people in the Central Highlands was estimated to number as many as one million. Today, the population is approximately four million, of whom about one million are Montagnards. The 30 or so Montagnard tribes in the Central Highlands comprise more than nineteen different ethnic groups who speak languages drawn primarily from the Malayo-Polynesian, Tai, and Austroasiatic language families. The main tribes, in order of population, are the Jarai, Rade, Bahnar, Koho, Mnong, and Stieng.

According to a genetic survey conducted in 2019 by Macholdt et al., two largest Montagnards groups, the Jarai, Rade, are genetically distinct from the mainstream Vietnamese ethnic groups. According to mitochondrial analyses on Jarai and Rade individuals, their paternal ancestors were a dark-skinned and woolly hair people related to Andamanese peoples, and their maternal ancestry mainly descended from a group of Polynesians who arrived much later. This study underlines the genetic diversity within the Central Highlands&#x27; native population, while further consolidating the Out of Africa migration of ancient peoples and refutes any challenge to the African origin of modern humans.

Ancient Chinese chronicles like the Book of Jin recorded that the West of Linyi (Champa) were inhabited by numerous tribes who were described as &quot;savages.&quot; According to the Jin dynasty annalists, in the 4th century CE the King of Lâm Ấp, Fan Wen, went to subdue and incorporated the tribes of Daqijie, Xiaoqijie, Ship, Xulang, Qudu, Ganlu, and Fudan in the Central Highlands into Champa&#x27;s territory.

The Old Book of Tang notes that the people of Champa have &quot;black skin, eyes deep in the orbit, short stature, broad nose, and frizzy hair.&quot;

Surrounded by Indianized and Sinicized states from all sides, the Montagnard tribes however have preserved their distinct cultures dating back to the prehistoric era, thanks to the high mountains. The Montagnard region was known by the Vietnamese as Rung Moi (Forest of the Savages).

The Montagnards have a history of tensions with the Vietnamese majority since the 19th century. While the Vietnamese or Kinh majority have a common language and culture and have developed and maintained the dominant social institutions of Vietnam, the Montagnard do not share that heritage. The Montagnards retain their tribal customs and ancestral land ownership. Unlike the Buddhist Vietnamese who are patriarchal, the Montagnards mainly practice traditional matrilineality, such as the Jarai and Rade, where head of the house is passed down from the mother to the oldest daughter, and women take charge of the leadership in tribal communities. There have been conflicts between the two groups over many issues, including land ownership, language and cultural preservation, access to education and resources, and political representation.

The Vietnamese defeated the Chams in 1471 and occupied former Champa. As anticipated, Vietnamese rulers established numerous military colonies, đôn điên, for Kinh settlers. However, they did not venture deep into the Highlands unlike the Chams, and there were no attempts to colonize the Highlands. But in 1802, the emperor of Vietnam, Gia Long, planned to pacify the Montagnard tribes. Several tribes and chiefdoms accepted tributary status under nominal Vietnamese overlord. Vietnamese privileged traders known as các lái were prominently active in the highland commodities trade involving Western merchants. Under Emperor Tu Duc, in 1863 a Son Phòng (mountain defense) program was laid out to prevent Hre tribal revolt as well as to collect taxes from friendly Montagnard tribes. The Son Phong program was dismantled by the French in 1898, as it had become outdated and corrupted.

Contacts between the Montagnards and Westerners started in the sixteenth century with Portuguese missionaries, followed by Dutch traders and French missionaries. European Jesuits such as Christoforo Borri reported tribes known as kemois (barbarians) dwelling in the mountainous areas of Cochinchina not yet subjected to the king. A French missionary, Père Gagelin, made the first direct contact with the tribes in 1830. In 1841, the bishop of Quy Nhon diocese, Mgr. Cuénot, wrote a short description of the Cham, the Rhade, and the Jarai tribes. In 1848, Vietnamese priest Father Dô was sent to investigate the highland and sought to study the Bahnar language and culture of the Montagnards. Major contacts occurred in the next decades, with a stream of outsiders, mostly Vietnamese Catholics, coming to Kon Tum to escape violence by members of the neo-Confucian extremist Văn Thân movement.

===Colonial period===

France conquered Cochinchina in 1862 and conquered Tonkin and Annam in 1883. At that time, the Montagnard lands remained largely unexplored. The French government began to search for backup evidence for their claim over the Montagnard lands by looking into Vietnamese annals and asserted historic Vietnamese suzerainty over the Jarai chiefdoms of p’tau apui and p’tau ia in 1889. The Jarai resisted and defeated the French in 1894, but later were subdued when the French came back in 1897 with more soldiers. In the next two decades, the French government made heavy efforts to secure the highlands and trust from the indigenous peoples. Despite that, the Montagnard tribes fiercely fought back. From 1901 to 1914, four high-ranking French military officers were killed by the Montagnard warriors armed with bows and sticks.

Kontum became a major settlement for Franco–Vietnamese Catholics by 1885. Direct rule over the Highlands began in 1898. The region was administered from a French center in Kontum, and tax collection among the Montagnards began on a regular basis. Missionary activities succeeded in converting the Bahnar tribes to Catholicism, but found difficulty with other tribes such as the Sedang, the Jarai, and the Mnong who refused to accept French colonial rule and industrial encroachment of their village lands. Resistance from the Sedang and Mnong would last as late as 1914. That said, there was more rivalry than cooperation between the Catholic Church and the French colonial administration. The missionary enclave in Kontum often acted with hostility to French government officials in preserving their and the associated converts&#x27; privileges, while the French government accused the Catholic missionaries of displacement of non-Christian villages, owning slaves, murders, and dispossession of lands. Disputes between missionaries and colonial officials reached a peak in the 1930s when French state officials openly tried to convert the Montagnards to Buddhism.

Several plans were proposed to colonize the highlands. Some believed that the Montagnards should be Christianized but their original culture also should be respected and preserved. Other Social-Darwinists pushed as far as proposing the colonization should be done with a large number of Vietnamese settlers, mainly Catholic, that would eventually outnumber the indigenous tribes and perform the tasks of &quot;civilizing&quot; them. Henri Maitre in his book &quot;Les Jungles Moï&quot; argued that the black Montagnards would be rapidly disappeared according to Social Darwinist theories which more advanced races like the Vietnamese and the French would gradually replace the Montagnards in their own ancestral lands.

L. Nouet, a French civil official, observed the Montagnards&#x27; swidden slash-and-burn style of agriculture and considered it a source of poverty, writing that &quot;the Moi are always hungry.&quot; He wrote that he wondered if a French decree of 1875 that prohibited agricultural practices of the rây (shifting cultivation) on the Montagnards was strictly enforced, that the Montagnard might starve and go extinct. Nouet believed that a Vietnamese migration into the Central Highlands would set up a social Darwinist &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; scenario that would be good for both groups.
French missionaries converted some Montagnards to the Catholic Church in the nineteenth century, but American missionaries converted more to Protestantism in the 1920s and 1930s. Of the approximately one million Montagnards, close to half are Protestant, and around 200,000 are Roman Catholic. This made Vietnam&#x27;s Communist Party suspicious of the Montagnards, particularly during the Vietnam War, since it was thought that they would be more inclined to help the heavily culturally Christian American forces.

The Indochinese Communist Party began to grow concerned about Montagnard autonomy as early as its First National Party Congress held in Macau 1935. The Meeting&#x27;s resolutions declared that all ethnic groups had the right &quot;to choose between adhering to the Union of Indochinese Soviet Republics and proclaiming itself a separate state. The Soviet government of the workers, peasants and soldiers of Indochina will in no way interfere or create obstacle...&quot;

The colonization of the Central Highlands became stalled in the 1930s due to a combination of many factors, including prolonged indigenous resistances of the Mnong led by N&#x27;Trang Lung and rubber uprisings; the Great Depression of 1929; decreasing global demand for rubber and coffee; and the mitigative policies applied by Leopold Sabatier, administrator of Đắk Lắk province from 1914 to 1926. Sabatier, an admirer of Rhade culture, was disgusted by abuses and forced assimilation imposed by missionaries upon the native Montagnards. Sabatier openly opposed against further expansion of French industrial businesses and Vietnamese migration into the Central Highlands, which he believed to be the main threat to traditional Montagnard society. As a result, by 1940 only 5,000 French and 35,000 Vietnamese lived in the region, mostly rubber contractors and Catholic settlers, compared to 750,000 indigenous Montagnards.

====Unrest of 1929====
In 1929, the price of rubber fell, and tensions rose. There were some attacks by Montagnard tribesmen against rubber plantations and transport trucks. While these were fairly minor events, the administration responded with air attacks on insurgent villages. The French also began building new roads to make it easier to monitor the area. Neo-Marxist scholar Geoffrey Gunn suggests that a growing indigenous Christian-millennialist movement among the Montagnards prior to the Montagnard revolt eight years later was a result of the French violent overreaction backlash during the economic crisis of 1929.

====Montagnard revolt of 1937====
In June 1937, Montagnard villages from many different tribes led by Sam Bram, a prominent Jarai chief in the vicinity of Cheo Reo, began to form an esoteric Christian religious movement. The chief announced that his daughter had given birth to a python who was believed to be an incarnation of the Python God called Dam Klan. Sam Bram distributed magic water (Jarai: la Iun) to his followers, and preached about how the expulsion of white people and Vietnamese from the highlands would fulfill a Biblical prophecy. The new faith spread quickly to Kontum, Quảng Nam, Quảng Ngãi, and to Rhade recruits of the French garrison of Buôn Ma Thuột. Followers of Sam Bram then attacked French patrols in the highlands. The movement was quickly suppressed by the French military, although Dieu Python groups in the north of the highlands continued to resist French pacification until 1940 when tribal resistance eventually linked up with Vietnamese communists active in the region.

At the end of the revolt in 1938, Sam Bram was sentenced to ten years in prison for &quot;sorcery with the aim of fraud by abuse of influence&quot;. Other 14 people who got involved in the movement were convicted 8 to 20 years in jail for &quot;sorcery, secret meetings and conspiracy against the state security.&quot;

The Dieu Python movement&#x27;s appeal across several distinct tribes convinced the French colonial officials, among others, of an incipient pan-highland nationalism. The French began treating the people of the &quot;Pays Moïs&quot; as one ethnicity and worthy of separate status, and attempted to suppress ethnic rivalries within the Montagnards. The French position of power also allowed them to decide which aspects of Montagnard culture should be preserved, and which ones changed; they were happy to celebrate harmless traditions such as ritual buffalo sacrifice, but continued discouraging shifting cultivation or the remnants of the Dieu Python movement. Leopold Sabatier, who had been driven out by rivals in the 1920s, was rehabilitated in French eyes as a visionary who had understood the locals. The result was the French administration presenting itself to the Montagnards as a friendly, if stern, father figure that protected them from the Kinh people, justifying the French administration as preserving Montagnard autonomy. The French military also sought to be ready to use the Highlands should a war with Japan come and they need to retreat inland.

===French Indochina War===

In April 1946, a Congress of the Southern National Minorities was held in Pleiku under the auspices of the Viet Minh. Ho Chi Minh, in his letter addressing the Congress, recognized the multinational nature of his proposed Vietnamese state which would be a country of the Kinh majority and &#x27;national&#x27; minorities alike. As the struggle broke out between the French and the Viet Minh, the Montagnards were split. Later communist Vietnamese historiography would glorify resistance from Montagnard populations including the Katu, H&#x27;re, Bahnar, and Cor tribes that aided the Viet Minh. Still, Kontum was a French stronghold, and the French rapidly reconquered the Central Highlands from 1945 to 1946. While the French had control of the Central Highlands and established the Montagnard autonomous region, their control was limited outside the major cities as time went on. Montagnard recruits to the French forces sometimes deserted in disgust at poor treatment from French officers, who would use their services for hard labor.

In 1950 the French government established the Central Highlands as the &quot;Pays Montagnard du Sud&quot; under the authority of Vietnamese Emperor Bảo Đại, whom the French had installed as nominal chief of state in 1949 as an alternative to Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Vietnam. While the French colonials were carrying out divide-and-rule strategy to exploit Montagnards and other tribes against the communist Vietminh, the Vietminh in turn employed the same strategy and tactics just as the French to by allying with alienated tribal leaders and dissatisfied tribes against the French. By 1953 it appears clear that the Vietminh had surpassed French efforts and much of the mountain tribes were under Vietminh control. 

In the same year, the Vietminh held another congress with the attendance of 140 tribal chiefs from 20 different ethnicities across the country, in which they announced the establishment of ethnic autonomous regions for the &quot;national minorities.&quot; By 1956, North Vietnam had created three ethnic autonomous regions.

In the mid-1950s, the once-isolated Montagnards began experiencing more contact with outsiders after the Vietnamese government launched efforts to gain better control of the Central Highlands and, following the 1954 Geneva Conference, new ethnic minorities from North Vietnam moved into the area. As a result of these changes, Montagnard communities felt a need to strengthen some of their own social structures and develop a more formal shared identity. When the French withdrew from Vietnam and recognized Vietnamese sovereignty, Montagnard political independence was drastically diminished.

=== Vietnam War ===

The new President of South Vietnam Ngo Dinh Diem opposed Montagnard autonomy. After introducing the 21st Act (Dụ số 21, enacted March 11, 1955), Diem abolished the Montagnard Autonomous Region. The Montagnards, Chinese, Khmer, and Cham were declared ethnic minorities. Implementing the Act disguised as Development and Land Reform Program, Diem confiscated all traditional indigenous Montagnard lands and distributed them to Kinh settlers from North Vietnam. More than one million Kinh migrants, mostly Catholic, were welcomed to settle in the Central Highlands. The Montagnards were expelled from their ancestral homelands or forced-relocated into confined strategic hamlets.

Diem continued this Development Act by forcing the Montagnards to learn Vietnamese, banning Montagnard languages in public schools, compelling the Montagnards to dress like Vietnamese, and forcing them to abandon their culture. He believed that these policies would overcoming the &#x27;superstition&#x27;, &#x27;ignorance and backwardness&#x27; of the indigenous villagers. Chief American advisor Wolf Ladejinsky who was the architect of Diem&#x27;s policies applauded the South Vietnamese development program as having progressively transformed the wilderness.

Meanwhile, in North Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh established Ethnic Autonomous Region in 1956 in accordance to the Bill no. 268/SL January 7, 1956, hinting that the North Vietnamese government recognized indigenous rights and land acknowledgements, though this did not last long. About 6,000 Rhade communists went north and trained by the North Vietnamese. US advisors, such as Price Gittinger of the US Operation Mission Agricultural Division, and Gerald Hickey, alarmed Diem that his Development Act would drive the Montagnard tribes to look for communists&#x27; support, further hurting efforts to contain communism in South Vietnam.

Wesley R. Fishel, chief executive advisor of the Michigan State University Vietnam Advisory Group (MSUG), in a letter to Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington DC in 1956, expressed that: &quot;This request may seem surprising, but the fact is that Viet-Nam has an Indian problem of its own, resembling in certain respects that of our own.&quot;

Meanwhile, the North Vietnamese were sending back trained Montagnard communist cadres back to the Central Highlands through the Ho Chi Minh trail, where they would play crucial roles such as recruiting Montagnard tribesmen into Vietcong guerrillas and spreading Marxist works and propaganda in indigenous languages to villages. It was estimated by the CIA that in 1961 roughly half of the highlander population of the Central Highlands were NLF sympathizers, if not outright supporters.

In 1958, the Montagnard launched a movement known as BAJARAKA (the name is made up of the first letters of prominent tribes; similar to the later Nicaraguan Misurasata) to unite the tribes against the Vietnamese. There was a related, well-organized political and (occasionally) military force within the Montagnard communities known by the French acronym, FULRO, or United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races. FULRO&#x27;s objectives were autonomy and civil rights for the Montagnard tribes. The BAJARAKA staged a mass protest in August 1958 but was put down by South Vietnam President Ngo Dinh Diem&#x27;s law enforcement forces, who implicitly perpetuated the oppressive assimilation policies on the disadvantaged indigenous communities in South Vietnam like the Chams, the Montagnards, and the Khmer Krom. Diem labeled the protest as &#x27;pro-communist sympathizers.&#x27;

On July 31, 1958, the BAJARAKA sent two representatives, Y-Ju and Y Nam, to the US Embassy in Saigon, where they attempted to reach and inform the United Nations Secretary-General and other world leaders about the unequal Development Act of the Diem regime, which they described as racist and neocolonial.

An declaration regarding the Montagnards was released in the first meeting of the NLF (Viet Cong) in 1960. It calls for the establishment of autonomous regions in minority areas and for the abolition of the &quot;US-Diêm clique&#x27;s present policy of ill-treatment and forced assimilation of the minority nationalities.&quot; Both the NLF and Hanoi actively recruited the Montagnards into their forces from 1960, with radio broadcasting propaganda in indigenous languages began as early as 1955. Some Montagnards leaders were invited to visit North Vietnam&#x27;s non-Kinh autonomous regions, along with promises of autonomy that would be granted for the Montagnards when the south is liberated. In 1961, Montagnard members of the Vietcong, led by Y Bih Aleo, a former BAJARAKA leader, formed the NLF&#x27;s Montagnard Autonomy Movement.

As the Vietnam War began to loom on the horizon, both South Vietnamese and American policymakers sought to begin training troops from minority groups in the Vietnamese populace. The U.S. Mission to Saigon sponsored the training of the Montagnards in unconventional warfare by American Special Forces. These newly trained Montagnard were seen as a potential ally in the Central Highlands area to stop Viet Cong activity in the region and a means of preventing further spread of Viet Cong sympathy. Later, their participation would become much more important as the Ho Chi Minh trail, the North Vietnamese supply line for Viet Cong forces in the south, grew. The U.S. military, particularly the Special Forces, developed base camps in the area and recruited the Montagnard. The Montagnard were valued allies with their resolve, skills in tracking, and knowledge of the region; roughly 40,000 fought alongside American soldiers and became a major part of the U.S. military effort in the Highlands and I Corps, the northernmost region of South Vietnam.

The central highlands were greatly affected by American aerial bombing and herbicides during targeting of North Vietnamese materiel transportation on the Ho Chi Minh trail.

The Montagnards also cooperated with the Australians in addition to the Americans; the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam gained the support of many Montagnards by spending prolonged periods in different villages in the region, embracing their culture and gaining over a thousand recruits for the South Vietnamese army by 1964.

In 1967, the Viet Cong killed 252 Montagnards in the village of Đắk Sơn, home to 2,000 Highlanders, known as the Đắk Sơn massacre, in revenge for the Montagnards&#x27; support and allegiance with South Vietnam.

A triangle relationship developed between Black American soldiers, white soldiers, Montagnards, and Vietnamese soldiers during the height of American ground intervention in Vietnam. Black veteran Wayne Smith recalled: &quot;some Vietnamese, you know they had some prejudices... They were discriminating against the Montagnards, the mountain people of Vietnam, who were darker complexioned... The Vietnamese treated them like white people in the South treated African Americans.&quot;

A &quot;The New York Times&quot; account in 1973 reported that land disputes between the Montagnards and the Vietnamese were deadly and reminiscent &quot;of the American Indian situation.&quot; In October 1974, with guides from FULRO, the Montagnards staged an armed rebellion following cases of murders and mass arrests made by the South Vietnamese government.

In 1975, thousands of Montagnards fled to Cambodia after the fall of Saigon to the North Vietnamese Army, fearing that the new government would launch reprisals against them because they had aided the U.S. Army. The U.S. military resettled some Montagnards in the United States, primarily in North Carolina, but these evacuees numbered less than 2,000. In addition, the Vietnamese government has steadily displaced thousands of villagers from Vietnam&#x27;s central highlands, to use the fertile land for coffee plantations.

Oscar Salemink outlines the conclusion on the dragging of indigenous peoples into the Vietnam War by the United States:

=== Post Vietnam War ===

Despite previous promises, the Vietnamese Communist leaders did not care about the Montagnards after the war. Vietnamese colonization of the Highlands resumed. Montagnard lands were seized and given to coffee and aluminum companies. The anticommunist wing of FULRO decided to continue their insurgency against now-unified Vietnam. Purges from the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam in 1976 and 1979 revealed that there were some Montagnards in its senior positions. FULRO continued the fight against the united Vietnamese government; the insurgency lasted into the mid-1980s.

Due to antireligious campaign of the Vietnamese communist government in 1970s, many Montagnard traditional animist religions were condemned as superstitious and excluded, as the Vietnamese government officially recognized six religions. Because of this, evangelical conversion among the Montagnard tribes during this period happened en masse. However, most of their churches are local non-denominational and non-registered from the state-recognized Evangelical Church of Vietnam (ECVN-S). Most considerably, indigenous ethnic minority Protestants prefer to have the Bible (NIV) translated to their indigenous languages, indigenous-run churches, indigenous pastors, sermons and meetings in indigenous customs inside tabernacles. However, these desires were met by suspicions and hostilities from the Vietnamese authorities, who considered non-denominational indigenous Protestantism a continuation of FULRO. In comparison, ethnic Kinh-run churches in the Highlands belonged to the Evangelical Church of Vietnam receive full legal rights and protections from the authorities. Popular but simplistic media portrayal of the Vietnamese repression of Dega Church as &quot;communist-Christianity confrontation&quot; is objected by scholars such as Oscar Salemink, who describes a similar pattern of Evangelization of indigenous peoples around the world, especially in the Global South, regardless of whatever political regimes, but in Vietnam the rhetorics of anti-communist vindications blame it on the communist ideology. University of London Professor Seb Rumsby further argues that Kinh chauvinism conjoint with Western media narrative accidentally push the marginalized indigenous Christians to uncritically take side with right-wing Christian conservative politics, which is the ultimate source of neocolonialism.

The final end of FULRO insurgency against Vietnam came in 1992, with the surrender of 407 FULRO fighters to United Nations&#x27; peacekeeping forces in Cambodia. They were interviewed by American journalist Nate Thayer. According to University of Texas Professor Frank Proschan, Nate Thayer successfully constructed an impression myth circulating around international media about the &quot;valiant, loyal Montagnard people who had been decades-long fighting against Vietnamese communists&quot;, captivating the colonial nostalgia of former US Special Forces personnel for an imagined past.

It is estimated that over 200,000 Montagnards died and 85% of their villages were destroyed or abandoned during the Indochina Wars.

Most Montagnards lost their lands due to the legacy of former South Vietnam&#x27;s president Ngô Đình Diệm. The indigenous peoples of the Central Highlands have deep knowledge of the local ecology and previously had life tied with forest, now strangled in impoverished separate hamlets. Uncontrolled Kinh migration from the lowland, deforestation, plantations, US bombings, defoliantation and prolonged warfare had clearing off many natural forests, pushing many rare species to extinction. Forest cover area percentage in the region had dropped significantly from 55% in 1960, to 17% in 1980.

After Vietnam&#x27;s Đổi Mới in 1986, due to ever-greater global capitalist demands of coffee and valuable metals, larger waves of Vietnamese migration arrived in the Central Highlands and overwhelmed indigenous highlanders. The Vietnamese population of the region went from 500,000 to 1975, to 4 million today, outnumbering native ethnic groups three-to-one. They were called &quot;di dân tự do&quot; (spontaneous migration) and were tentatively given tolerance from Vietnamese authorities. The original peoples of the Central Highlands experienced ruin during and after the Vietnam War; in the worst cases, they were driven from their land and became refugees.

The government policy of sedentarization also left the indigenous peoples apart from society. One Vietnamese anthropologist has described a typical pattern of this impoverishment process: Kinh settlers took the opportunities of exploiting imperfect laws and the judicial system to fraudulently legitimize their assets ownership that were once belonged to indigenous peoples. As the result of being alienated from the means of production (lands), indigenous peoples of the Central Highlands became the poorest population in Vietnam, many have moved to cities and work for either Vietnamese plantation owners or foreign investment facilities, the phenomena that Salemink dubbed as proletarianization of indigenous peoples under &quot;socialist-orientated&quot; free market capitalist economy.

In February 2001, thousands of Montagnards participated in mass protests demanding returns of ancestral lands and religious freedom. Other such protests took place in 2002, 2004, and 2008. The protests involved marches and sit ins. The nearby government officials reacted with military involvement and police arrests. Many Montagnards such as the Jarai were put on trial and imprisoned for years for their involvement in the protests. Some Montagnards residing in the United States also traveled to Washington, D.C. to protest and bring awareness to the Montagnards back in Vietnam. Pressured by indigenous demonstrations, in July 2004 Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Văn Khải passed Bill 134, pledged to allocate every low-income indigenous household a plot of 0.37 acre of farm land or at least 2,150 sqft (200 square meters) of housing land, also limited or suspended the uncontrolled migration of Vietnamese onto the Central Highlands.

More than 1,000 Montagnard refugees have entered Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri, Cambodia, since 2001, raising issues of Cambodia&#x27;s international law obligations toward refugees and its right to control its border. The government has a policy of deporting Degar refugees to Vietnam, viewing them as illegal immigrants to the country, and has threatened prosecution of Ratanakiri residents who aid them. Human rights organizations have described this policy as a violation of Cambodia&#x27;s international law obligation of non-refoulement (not forcibly returning refugees to a country in which they will be harmed). Though the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has become involved processing asylum applications, refugees are often forcibly returned before they are able to apply for asylum. Many refugees have hidden in Ratanakiri&#x27;s forests to avoid deportation.

In 2003, the group gained admittance to the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization as the &quot;Degar-Montagnards&quot;, but this membership was discontinued in 2016. Since 1990, the Montagnard Foundation, Inc. () has been a political organization whose mission is to protect the rights of the Montagnard in Vietnam.

==Diaspora==
Outside of southeast Asia, the largest community of Montagnards in the world is located in Greensboro, North Carolina, US. Greensboro is also the home of several community and lobbying organizations, such as the Montagnard Foundation, Inc.

<text>Written vernacular Chinese, also known as baihua, comprises forms of written Chinese based on the vernacular varieties of the language spoken throughout China. It is contrasted with Literary Chinese, which was the predominant written form of the language in imperial China until the early 20th century.

A style based on vernacular Mandarin Chinese was used in novels by Ming and Qing dynasty authors, and was later refined by intellectuals associated with the May Fourth Movement. This form corresponds to spoken Standard Chinese, but is the standard form of writing used by speakers of all varieties of Chinese throughout mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Singapore. It is commonly called Standard Written Chinese or Modern Written Chinese to distinguish it from spoken vernaculars and other written vernaculars, like written Cantonese and written Hokkien.

== Background ==
During the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BC), Old Chinese was the spoken form of the language, which was reflected in the Classical Chinese used to write the Chinese classics. Spoken Chinese began to evolve faster than the written form, which continued to emulate the language of the classics. The differences grew over time: By the Tang and Song dynasties (618–1279), people began to write in their vernacular dialects in the form of &quot;bianwen&quot; and &quot;yulu&quot; (), and the spoken language was completely distinct from the formal Literary Chinese. Familiarity with Literary Chinese was fundamental to higher education. During the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368–1912), vernacular language began to be used in novels, but most formal writing was in Literary Chinese, save a few &quot;baihua&quot; newspapers during the late Qing.

In the 20th century, political activists began attempting to replace formal Literary Chinese with a written vernacular based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin. Possible reforms included the replacing characters with a phonetic writing system, character simplification, and expanding the vernacular lexicon with technical terminology for use in formal contexts. These activists wanted to create a literary context more accessible to the general public, and ultimately increase literacy in the country.

Written vernacular Chinese was also popularized by the Western missionaries entering China during the 19th century. Missionaries wrote stories, poems, essays and other works in vernacular to better spread their message. This early form of &quot;baihuawen&quot; was mainly written according to local vernaculars, rather than based on a specific dialect. Missionaries retained some of the style of the original texts, while adapting them to a Chinese audience.
Lower Yangtze Mandarin formed the standard for written vernacular Chinese, until it was displaced by the Beijing dialect during the late Qing. &quot;Baihua&quot; () was used by writers across China regardless of their local spoken dialect. Writers used Lower Yangtze and Beijing grammar and vocabulary in order to make their writing understandable to the majority of readers. While more difficult to master for writers who spoke other dialects, this standard written vernacular had the effect of standardizing written Chinese across the country, which had previously been the role of Literary Chinese. Following the May Fourth Movement, &quot;baihuawen&quot; became the normal written form of Chinese. While the phonology of modern Standard Chinese is based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin, its grammar is officially based on exemplary works of vernacular literature, which excludes certain colloquial forms while incorporating some constructions from Literary Chinese. Similarly, written vernacular Chinese excludes slang from the Beijing dialect while absorbing some Literary vocabulary, as well as foreign loanwords and a small number of regionalisms from other major dialect groups.

=== 20th century reforms ===
The period following the overthrow of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China was characterized by efforts at language reform. Many of the first language reformers of this period were associated with the New Culture Movement, which began around 1916 due to anti-imperialist and anti-traditionalist sentiments which boiled over during the May Fourth Movement, and which also promoted concepts like republicanism and democracy.

These sentiments inspired a movement to democratize language and replace classical Chinese with a written vernacular. Some of the most important proponents of vernacularization were Mao Zedong and renowned writer Lu Xun. This was at first before the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party, which occurred in 1921, though some of the most radical language reform activists were communists.

There was significant debate among reformers on what steps to language reform should be taken, and how far reform should go. The central component was vernacularization, but questions such as the extent to which the written vernacular should borrow elements from classical Chinese and whether Chinese characters should be replaced by an alphabet or another kind of writing system were hotly debated. Mao, Lu, and the more radical activists at first argued for replacing characters with a phonetic writing system, which they believed would more easily facilitate a switch from classical Chinese to vernacular language in writing. However, as it became increasingly clear that the Communists were winning the Chinese Civil War and would have control over mainland China, a change occurred in thinking at the top of the Chinese Communist Party. The official goal became to first simplify characters, then to possibly transition to a romanized phonetic writing system over time. The precise history of why and how this happens remains obscure, and the extent of the role that Chairman Mao Zedong played in the change of policy is not known. However, it has been suggested that Communist leadership wanted to preserve the cultural heritage of Chinese characters, while also encouraging increased literacy among the Chinese people. It has even been suggested that Mao acted to preserve characters at the encouragement of Joseph Stalin, so that China would maintain a domestic writing system and the linguistic heritage attached to it. An eventual switch from Chinese characters to pinyin, a domestically perfected romanized phonetic writing system, was indefinitely postponed to the point that it remains a complementary system to simplified characters, which is the dominant writing system in contemporary mainland China.

== Literature ==
The early modern period saw the first significant development of &quot;baihua&quot; novels. Jin Shengtan, who edited several vernacular novels in the 17th century, is widely regarded as a pioneer of vernacular Chinese literature. His vernacular edition of the classic novel &quot;Water Margin&quot; greatly raised the status of vernacular novels. During the late Qing, activists like Liang Qichao argued for the simplicity of &quot;baihua&quot; and its utility for increasing literacy rates. However, it was not until after the onset of the May Fourth Movement in 1919 and the promotion of vernacular writing by public intellectuals—such as reformer Hu Shih, writers Chen Hengzhe, Lu Xun, and Qian Xuantong, and the revolutionary Chen Duxiu—that vernacular Chinese gained widespread importance. In particular, Lu Xun&#x27;s &quot;The True Story of Ah Q&quot; is generally accepted as the first modern work to fully utilize vernacular language.

During this period, &quot;baihua&quot; literature is also considered to be ideologically progressive. On one hand, reformers aggressively debated over the use of loanwords and the ideology of literature and public acceptance of new genres, while the consensus became clear that the imposition of Literary Chinese was a hindrance to education and literacy, and ultimately social progress within China. The work of Lu Xun and others did much to advance this view. Vernacular Chinese soon came to be viewed as mainstream by most people. Along with the growing popularity of vernacular writing in books in this period was the acceptance of punctuation, modelled after what was used in Western languages (traditional Chinese literature used almost no punctuation), and the use of Arabic numerals. Following the 1911 Revolution, successive governments continuously carried out a progressive and national education system to include primary and secondary education. All the curricula were in vernacular Chinese. Prolific writers such as Lu Xun and Bing Xin published popular works and appeared in literary journals of the day, which also published essays and reviews providing a theoretical background for the vernacular writing, such as Lu&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, which provoked a spirited debate in contemporary journals. Systematic education, talented authors and an active scholastic community closely affiliated with the education system all contributed to the establishment of the vernacular written language in a short amount of time.

Since the late 1920s, nearly all Chinese newspapers, books, and official and legal documents have been written in vernacular Standard Chinese. However, the tone or register and the choice of vocabulary may have been formal or informal, depending on the context. Generally, the more formal the register of vernacular Chinese, the greater the resemblance to Literary Chinese; modern writing lies on a continuum between the two. Since the transition, it has been extremely rare for a text to be written predominantly in Literary Chinese. Until the 1970s, the legal code of the Republic of China was written in Literary Chinese, though in a form replete with modern expressions and constructions that would have been foreign to ancient writers. Similarly, until the end of the 20th century, men of letters, especially in Taiwan, exchanged personal letters using literary stock phrases for openings, greetings, and closings, and using vernacular Chinese (albeit heavily influenced by the literary language) for the body. Nevertheless, only well-educated individuals in modern times have full reading comprehension of Literary texts, and very few are able to write proficiently in Literary Chinese. Presently, the ability to read some Literary Chinese is taught using familiar character forms: simplified throughout mainland China, and traditional in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. In the latter, Tang poetry is taught starting from elementary school and classical prose taught throughout lower and upper secondary schools.

Though it is rare to encounter fully Literary texts in modern times, it is just as rare to see texts of a considerable length only employ colloquial Chinese resources and exclude all Literary constructions and vocabulary. Despite initial intentions on the part of reformers to create a written language that closely mirrors the colloquial Mandarin dialects and to expunge classical influences from the language for the sake of modernization, it became clear to users of the new written standard that the admixture of a certain proportion of Literary grammatical constructions and vocabulary into &quot;baihuawen&quot; was unavoidable and serves as an important means of conveying tone and register. Thus, for the vernacular language used in official settings like academic and literary works or government communications (e.g. in academic papers, textbooks, political speeches, and legal codes), a small number of stock classical constructions and vocabulary items continue to be employed and are subject to additional related requirements relating to classical prosody and parallelism. The use of these structures is a characteristic of formal registers of &quot;baihuawen&quot; and distinguishes the formal modern language from conversational &quot;baihuawen&quot; on the one hand and fully Literary on the other hand. Though clearly dependent on context and on the personal preferences of the author, analyses of typical 20th-century essays and speeches have yielded a ratio of formal to informal expressions of around 2:3, or 40%. Even in informal personal communications otherwise composed entirely in the vernacular, classical words and usages may still appear every so often. In particular, &quot;chengyu&quot; are used by writers and speakers of all education levels in a variety of contexts.

== Variation ==
Multiple regional varieties of written written vernacular Chinese exist:
* China uses simplified characters and a set of lexicon and grammar associated with Putonghua, regulated by the State Language Commission.
* Taiwanese Mandarin has important differences from Putonghua in terms of vocabulary. It is written in traditional characters and is regulated by the National Languages Committee.
* Hong Kong written Chinese differs from other forms of written Chinese in terms of vocabulary and grammar. It is written in Traditional characters. It is not standardized and is associated with a phonology derived from Cantonese.
* Singaporean Mandarin and Malaysian Mandarin are written using Simplified characters. They are regulated by Promote Mandarin Council and Chinese Language Standardization Council, respectively.

== Other Chinese varieties ==
There is also literature written in Cantonese, Shanghainese, and Taiwanese Hokkien, which uses additional characters to record the different vocabulary present in these varieties. Efforts to standardize their written forms include the Taiwanese Southern Min Recommended Characters. They are most commonly used in advertisements and court records of dialogue and colloquial expressions. They are often mixed with Literary and modern Standard vocabulary.

<text>Jin Shengtan (; 1610?7 August 1661), former name Jin Renrui (), also known as Jin Kui (), was a Chinese editor, writer and critic, who has been called the champion of Vernacular Chinese literature.

==Biography==

The year of Jin&#x27;s birth is unclear, with some sources reporting 1610 and others 1608. The former estimate is based on the fact that Jin&#x27;s son was 10 years old in East Asian age reckoning in 1641, and is generally accepted by scholars. He was born Jin Renrui in the town of Suzhou, a place celebrated for its culture and elegance. Jin&#x27;s family was of the scholar-gentry class, but was constantly plagued by sickness and death, which led in turn to little wealth. Jin&#x27;s father was apparently a scholar. Jin began schooling relatively late, attending a village school at the age of nine. He displayed great intellectual curiosity, and had somewhat unusual ideas. However, he was a conscientious student. Early in life, he took the style name &quot;Shengtan&quot;, a phrase from the &quot;Analects&quot; meaning &quot;the sage [Confucius] sighed&quot;. He passed only the lowest of the imperial examinations, and never held public office.

In his writings, Jin showed a great interest in the ideas of Chan Buddhism. He claimed that this interest began early, when he first read the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; at the age of 11. This inclination toward Buddhist ideas became even more pronounced after the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644. In that year and the one that followed, Jin became conspicuously more depressed and withdrawn, as well as more receptive to Buddhism. The 20th century scholar Zhang Guoguang attributed this change to the fall of the short-lived Li Zicheng regime. Throughout his life, Jin&#x27;s interest in Buddhism affected his views, and he considered himself a mere agent of the forces of eternity.

Jin is sometimes said to have been known by the name Zhang Cai (), but this appears to be a mistake due to confusion with a contemporary, Zhang Pu.

===Death===

In 1661, Jin joined a number of literati in protesting the appointment of a corrupt official. The protesters first petitioned the government, and then staged a public rally. This was met with swift retaliation from local officials, and Jin was sentenced to death. This incident is sometimes called &quot;Lamenting at the Temple of Confucius&quot; (), and led to a stifling of political dissent for years after. Before his death, Jin supposedly joked, &quot;Being beheaded is the most painful thing, but for some reason it&#x27;s going to happen to me. Fancy that!&quot; In a 1933 essay, noted writer Lu Xun admits that this quote may be apocryphal, but condemns it as &quot;laughing away the cruelty of the human butcher&quot;.
==Literary theory and criticism==

He was known for formulating a list of what he called the &quot;&quot;: the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;, the poem &quot;Li Sao&quot;, &quot;Shiji&quot;, Du Fu&#x27;s poems, &quot;Romance of the Western Chamber&quot;, and the &quot;Water Margin&quot;. This list contained both highly classical works, like &quot;Li Sao&quot; and Du Fu&#x27;s poems, and novels or plays in vernacular Chinese that had their origins in the streets and marketplace. The six works were chosen based on their literary merit, as opposed to their upstanding morals. For these reasons, Jin was considered an eccentric and made many enemies among the conservative Confucian scholars of his day. Jin edited, commented on, and added introductions and interlinear notes to the popular novels the &quot;Water Margin&quot; and &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, and the Yuan dynasty drama, &quot;Romance of the Western Chamber&quot;.

Jin is often grouped with Mao Zonggang, and Zhang Zhupo as commentator/editors. Mao&#x27;s commentarial edition of Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Zhang&#x27;s commentary on The Plum in the Golden Vase featured (讀法 lit. &quot;way to read&quot;) which interpreted the novels using a vocabulary and critical standards which up to then had been limited to poetry and painting. This innovation raised the status of fiction for Chinese readers and made the writing of fiction into a respectable activity for educated people.

Jin believed that only the emperor and wise sages could truly &quot;author&quot; a work. He points out that even Confucius took pains to avoid being named the author of the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;. In Jin&#x27;s view, the authoring of books by commoners would lead to the undermining of heavenly order and peace. He saw his commentary as the only way to minimize the damage caused by books &quot;authored&quot; by those who were unworthy to do so. In writing his commentaries, Jin firmly believed that the story that was written should be read on its own terms, apart from reality. In his commentary on &quot;Romance of the Western Chamber&quot;, he wrote, &quot;the meaning lies in the writing, and does not lie in the event&quot;. In other words, it is the story that is written that matters, rather than how well that story emulates reality. At the same time, Jin believed that authorial intention is less important than the commentator&#x27;s reading of a story. In his &quot;Romance of the Western Chamber&quot; commentary, he writes, &quot;&quot;Xixiang Ji&quot; is not a work written by an individual named Wang Shifu alone; If I read it carefully, it will also be a work of my own creation, because all the words in &quot;Xixiang Ji&quot; happen to be the words that I want to say and that I want to write down&quot;.

==Major works==

===Commentary on the &quot;Water Margin&quot;===

Jin&#x27;s first major critical activity, completed in 1641, was a commentary on the popular Chinese novel the &quot;Water Margin&quot;. The commentary begins with three prefaces, in which Jin discusses his reasons for undertaking the commentary, and the achievements of the work&#x27;s putative author Shi Nai&#x27;an. The next section is entitled &quot;How to Read the Fifth Work of Genius&quot;. In addition to advice for the reader, this section contains Jin&#x27;s thoughts on the literary achievements of the novel as a whole. The novel itself comes next, with introductory marks preceding each chapter, and critical comments inserted frequently between passages, sentences, and even words of the text.

Jin&#x27;s version of the &quot;Water Margin&quot; is most well known for the drastic alterations that he makes to the text. Earlier versions of the text are 100- or 120-chapter in length. Jin deletes a large portion of the story, from the second half of chapter 71 to the end of the novel. In order to bring the modified text to a conclusion, he composes an episode in which Lu Junyi has a vision of the execution of the band, and amends this to the second half of chapter 71. Jin also combines the Prologue of earlier editions with the first chapter, creating a new, single chapter titled &quot;Induction&quot;. This forces the renumbering of all subsequent chapters, so Jin&#x27;s version of the &quot;Water Margin&quot; is referred to by scholars as the &quot;70-Chapter Edition&quot;. In addition to the large changes described above, Jin also changes the text of the remaining chapters in three general ways. First, he improves the consistency of some sections, such that, for example, chapters whose content do not match their titles receive new names. Secondly, Jin makes the text more compact by removing sections that he feels do not advance the story, and by excising the incidental Shi and Ci verses. Finally, Jin makes subtle changes to the text for pure literary effect. These changes range from emphasizing the emotions of characters to changing story elements to make them more compelling.

Jin&#x27;s critical commentary frequently oscillates between sympathizing with the individual bandit-heroes and condemning their status as outlaws. On one hand, he criticizes the evil official system that has led many of the 108 heroes to become bandits. He also expresses admiration for several of the men. On the other hand, he calls the band &quot;malignant&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;. He especially criticizes Song Jiang, the leader of the group. Jin&#x27;s removal of the last 30 (or 50) chapters of the novel can be seen as an extension of his condemnation of banditry. In these chapters, the bandits are pardoned by Imperial edict, and are put in service of the country. Jin&#x27;s version, by contrast, has all of the bandits captured and executed. He follows this ending with eight reasons why outlawry can never be tolerated.

Later readers of Jin have advanced two main theories for his divergent positions of admiring the bandits and yet denouncing them as a group. Hu Shih argues that China during Jin&#x27;s life was being torn apart by two bands of outlaws, so Jin did not believe that banditry should be glorified in fiction. This agrees well with Jin&#x27;s philosophy. His Buddhist and Taoist beliefs advocated natural development for every individual in society, while the Confucian part of him respected the emperor and the state as the ultimate authority. The other possibility is that Jin&#x27;s attempt to reimage the novel into a condemnation of the bandits was to save the novel after it had been banned by the Chongzhen Emperor. This second theory is far-fetched, as the emperor&#x27;s decree banning the novel was not promulgated until a year after the completion of Jin&#x27;s commentary. Jin&#x27;s views on the characters aside, he has unconditional praise for the novel as a work of art. He praises the vivid and lively characters of the novel, saying, &quot;The &quot;Water Margin&quot; tells a story of 108 men: yet each has his own nature, his own temperament, his own outward appearance, and his own voice&quot;. He also praises the work&#x27;s vivid description of events, frequently remarking that the prose is &quot;like a picture&quot;. Finally, Jin appreciates the technical virtuosity of the author, and names 15 separate techniques used by Shi Naian.

===Commentary on the &quot;Romance of the Western Chamber&quot;===

In 1656, Jin completed his second major commentary, written on the &quot;Romance of the Western Chamber&quot;, a 13th-century Yuan dynasty play. This commentary follows a structure very similar to Jin&#x27;s earlier commentary on the &quot;Water Margin&quot;. It begins with two prefaces outlining Jin&#x27;s reasons for writing the commentary followed by a third with notes on how the play should be read. The play itself follows, with introductory marks preceding each chapter and critical comments frequently inserted in the text itself. Jin undertakes fewer major structural alterations in this commentary than he does in critiquing the &quot;Water Margin&quot;. Each of parts I, III, IV, and V of the play is originally preceded by an &quot;Induction&quot;. Jin merges these into the acts themselves. Part II of the play originally consists of five acts, which Jin condenses into four by merging the first and second acts.

As with the &quot;Water Margin&quot;, Jin frequently makes editorial changes to the play itself. These changes fall into two broad categories. Many changes are made in order to make the play&#x27;s two young lovers, Zhang Sheng and Cui Yingying, act and speak in accordance with their high class backgrounds. Jin particularly expresses his admiration for Yingying&#x27;s beauty and character, and modifies any scenes which he feels painted her in too vulgar a light. Other changes are made for the simple reason of achieving superior literary effect. In the arias of the play, these changes include removing supernumerary words and changing words to more vivid descriptors. The strict metrical requirements of the aria format makes it difficult for Jin to make large-scale changes to these sections. However, some changes do violate the rhyme scheme as it existed during the Tang dynasty or the rules of prosody. In the spoken sections of the play, Jin is much more liberal in making editorial changes. Many of these are intended to accentuate the emotions of the characters. The end result is that Jin&#x27;s version of the play is an excellent literary work, but was viewed by contemporaries as unfit for the stage.

In his commentary, Jin frequently criticizes previous &quot;unknowledgeable&quot; readers, saying that they have missed many hidden meanings in the text. He sees it as his duty as a knowledgeable reader to reveal these meanings which the author has placed for him to find. In doing so, Jin also has the goal of portraying the play as worthy of study due to its deep technical, artistic, psychological, and social dimensions. In content, much of Jin&#x27;s critical comments focus on the skill of the author in conveying emotions. Jin praises &quot;Romance of the West Chamber&quot; as &quot;[one of the most] marvelous [pieces of] writing between heaven and earth&quot;. Other comments focus on Yingying. As mentioned above, Jin feels that she is the central character of the play, and a woman of great beauty and character. Jin feels that the play shows a great degree of unity and tightness in its structure. This opinion can be seen explicitly in his comments, as well as in the fact that he does not make structural alterations to the play to nearly the degree as in his version of &quot;Water Margin&quot;. Jin does, however, comment on Part V of the play. This part has been thought by some commentators to be a continuation added by an author other than Wang Shifu. Jin agrees with this view, criticizing the last part as being inferior in quality to the previous sections and continuing the story past its vital point.

==Reputation and legacy==

Many of Jin&#x27;s contemporaries admired him as a man possessing great literary talent. Qian Qianyi, a famous scholar, official, and historian of the late Ming dynasty, proclaimed that Jin was possessed by a spirit, explaining his talent. In a biography of Jin, Liao Yan wrote that Jin had discovered the entire secret of competition. Some contemporaries and later writers did denounce Jin on moral grounds. Jin&#x27;s contemporary Kui Zhuang called him &quot;greedy, perverse, licentious, and eccentric&quot;.

After the May Fourth Movement in 1919, scholars such as Hu Shih began to advocate the writing of novels in Vernacular Chinese. As a result, Jin gained recognition as a pioneer in the field of Chinese popular literature. Hu Shih himself praised Jin in the preface to his commentary on the &quot;Water Margin&quot;, saying, &quot;Sheng-t&#x27;an&#x27;s ability to debate was invincible; his pen was most persuasive. During his time, he had the reputation of a genius. His death was also a case of extreme cruelty, which shook the whole country. After his death, his reputation became even greater&quot;. Liu Bannong, another scholar of the era, also praised Jin&#x27;s version of &quot;Water Margin&quot; as the best edition in terms of literary value.

After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, many common views on history changed. Under the Communist government, &quot;Water Margin&quot; became a tale of peasant resistance to the ruling class, and &quot;Romance of the West Chamber&quot; symbolized the casting off of the outmoded traditional marriage system. Jin&#x27;s critiques and editorial modifications of these works did not mirror the world view of Marxism, however, and he began to be criticized. In more recent years, however, Chinese historians have adopted a more balanced view of Jin.

<text>Qian Xuantong (188717 January 1939) was a Chinese linguist and writer considered to be a leading figure of the Doubting Antiquity School, along with Gu Jiegang. He was a professor of literature at National Peking University.

== Biography ==
Born in Huzhou, Zhejiang, Qian was named Qian Xia at birth and was given the courtesy name Deqian. Qian trained in traditional Chinese philology. After receiving his university education in Japan, Qian held a number of teaching positions in mainland China. He was a student of Zhang Binglin; some of Zhang&#x27;s works were copied and printed in Qian&#x27;s seal script handwriting. As a philologist, Qian was the first to reconstruct the vowel system of Old Chinese in the IPA.

A close friend of Lu Xun, Qian was a key figure in the May Fourth Movement and the New Culture Movement. Despite his close relationship with the Chinese classics, he promoted the abolition of Literary Chinese. He was also a strong supporter of Esperanto, at one time even proposed the substitution of Chinese by it. An open letter Qian wrote in response to an anti-Confucian essay by Chen Duxiu stated:

Chen thought that abolishing written Chinese would destroy the spoken language as well, and he countered Qian&#x27;s proposal by suggesting that Chinese could use a Roman alphabet.

He and Liu Bannong promoted vernacular Chinese, attacking classical stylists such as Lin Shu. His skepticism of the Chinese heritage was such that he at one time wanted to change his surname to Yigu (). He also did important work regarding standardization of simplified characters, as well as the Standard Chinese dialect and the design of pinyin.

His son Qian Sanqiang was a nuclear physicist who was instrumental in China&#x27;s early nuclear weapons program, sometimes referred to as the &quot;father of the atomic bomb&quot; for China.

<text>The Claremont Colleges (known colloquially as the 7Cs) are a consortium of seven private institutions of higher education located in Claremont, California, United States. They comprise five undergraduate colleges (the 5Cs)—Pomona College, Scripps College, Claremont McKenna College (CMC), Harvey Mudd College, and Pitzer College—and two graduate schools—Claremont Graduate University (CGU) and Keck Graduate Institute (KGI). All the members except KGI have adjoining campuses, together covering roughly .

The consortium was founded in 1925 by Pomona College president James A. Blaisdell, who proposed a collegiate university design inspired by Oxford University. He sought to provide the specialization, flexibility, and personal attention commonly found in small colleges, but with the resources of a large university. The consortium has since grown to roughly students and faculty and staff, and offers more than 2,000 courses every semester. The colleges share a central library, campus safety services, health services, and other resources, managed by The Claremont Colleges Services (TCCS). Among the undergraduate schools, there is significant social interaction and academic cross-registration, but each college maintains a distinct identity.

Admission to the Claremont Colleges is considered highly selective.&lt;section begin=&quot;reputation reference&quot; /&gt;&lt;section end=&quot;reputation reference&quot; /&gt; For the Class of 2020 admissions cycle, four of the five most selective liberal arts colleges in the U.S. by acceptance rate were among the 5Cs (the five undergraduate colleges), and the remaining college, Scripps, had the second-lowest acceptance rate among women&#x27;s colleges. The Fiske Guide to Colleges describes the consortium as &quot;a collection of intellectual resources unmatched in America.&quot;

== Colleges ==
The five undergraduate colleges are:
*Pomona College (founded 1887) is the oldest of the Claremont Colleges and the largest of the undergraduate schools. It is coeducational and offers majors in the arts, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences.
*Scripps College (founded 1926) is the women&#x27;s college of the Claremont Colleges. It offers an interdisciplinary curriculum with an emphasis in the humanities.
*Claremont McKenna College (founded 1946), was founded as Claremont Men&#x27;s College and became coeducational in 1976. It specializes in political science, economics, finance, and international relations.
*Harvey Mudd College (founded 1955) specializes in engineering, mathematics, computer science, and the physical and biological sciences but also includes coursework in the humanities and social sciences.
*Pitzer College (founded 1963) is known for its experimental pedagogical approach and focus on social justice. Its curriculum emphasizes the social sciences.

The two graduate universities are:
*Claremont Graduate University (founded 1925) awards master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees in 31 disciplines across seven schools.
*Keck Graduate Institute (founded 1997) is a biomedical graduate school, with schools of applied life science, pharmacy and health sciences, and medicine. It also formerly co-sponsored a remote four-year undergraduate program, Minerva Schools at KGI, which has since spun off as Minerva University, an independent institution no longer affiliated with KGI or with the Claremont Colleges.

The Claremont School of Theology (founded 1885) (and thus Claremont Lincoln University) is affiliated with the consortium but is not a member. In January, 2024, after nearly a decade, the Claremont School of Theology finalized a deal to sell the 16 acres of prime Village real estate it has occupied since 1957 back to the Claremont College for $7.7 million.

==History==

Before the idea of the Claremont Colleges, Pomona College was founded in 1887. Pomona began after a group of congregationalists envisioned a &quot;New England-type&quot; college on the West Coast. Pomona College relocated to Claremont, California after the college acquired an unfinished hotel in Claremont. And 23 years later, James A. Blaisdell became president of Pomona. Though in 1923, Pomona College faced a problem. The school&#x27;s population was growing. Thus, Pomona either had to go against their ideals of expanding or limit the amount of growth at the college. James Blaisdell developed a different option. He advised the college chose to form a consortium of differentiated small colleges, modeled after Oxford and Cambridge. In October 1923, President James A. Blaisdell of Pomona College wrote to Ellen Browning Scripps describing a vision of educational excellence he had for the future Claremont Colleges:

The start of the Claremont Colleges came in 1925 with the addition of a graduate school, now known as Claremont Graduate University. The college was originally known as Claremont College and began to function in 1927. The second addition came in 1926 when Ellen Browning Scripps founded Scripps College. Scripps College allowed Ellen Browning Scripps to put-forth her plan of a school which offered women access to a higher education, to better their professional careers and to better their personal lives. Scripps College officially opened in 1927.

The novelty of the arrangement, combined with marketing that drew up the perception of the west coast as a novel frontier, led to nationwide interest in and praise for the colleges in the 1930s. Paul Monroe of Harvard University, the foremost educational historian of the era, wrote that year that &quot;The torch of learning was borne aloft in the first century by Antioch and Athens; in the second century by Rome and Alexandria; by Padua and Paris in the twelfth; Oxford and Cambridge in the fifteenth; Harvard and Yale in the seventeenth; Columbia and Chicago in the nineteenth; the Claremont Colleges of the West in the twentieth.&quot;
In 1946, 86 students and 7 faculty members formed the fourth institution of the Claremont Colleges, known as Claremont McKenna College. CMC was formed as a fully male undergraduate school until women were admitted in 1976. In 1955, Harvey Mudd College became the fifth institute in the consortium. HMC was founded by Harvey Seeley Mudd, a former chairman of the Board of Fellows of Claremont College. He envisioned an undergraduate college in the consortium that focused its education in science and engineering. In 1963, Pitzer College joined the Claremont Colleges. Pitzer was founded as a college for woman focusing on the social sciences. Later in 1970, Pitzer enrolled 80 men. The school was named after Russell K. Pitzer, an important benefactor in the development of the institution. The final and seventh college to join the consortium was Keck Graduate Institute. KGI was founded in 1997 after a $50 million donation from W.M. Keck Foundation. The graduate school focuses on post-graduate biomedical applications. Initially planned to be located on Bernard Field Station lands, protests forced the institute to relocate to a site southwest of the Claremont Village. Alongside the institutions, Claremont College Services was founded on July 1, 2000. The Claremont College Services provides educational support to all the institutions in the consortium. Specifically, TCCS aids in projects of group planning, establishment of new institutions into the consortium and hold expansion lands.

== Organization and operation ==
The Claremont Colleges employ approximately 3,600 people . A report commissioned for the colleges estimated that the consortium had a regional economic impact of $706.8 million during the 2016–2017 academic year.

== Reputation and rankings ==
Admission to the Claremont Colleges is considered highly selective.

According to the American Liberal Arts College rankings released by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in fall 2021, the &quot;5Cs&quot; were ranked among the top 35 liberal arts colleges in the United States: Pomona College (#3), Claremont McKenna College (#9), Harvey Mudd College (#29), Scripps College (#33), and Pitzer College (#33). Additionally, all of the undergraduate colleges are categorized as &quot;Most Selective&quot;. &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked the 5C&#x27;s among the top 60 undergraduate colleges (including universities and military academies) in the nation and within the top 25 liberal arts colleges for its 2017 report: Pomona College (#10 overall, #1 LAC), Claremont McKenna College (#11 overall, #2 LAC), Harvey Mudd College (#18 overall, #5 LAC), Scripps College (#43 overall, #16 LAC), and Pitzer College (#59 overall, #23 LAC). Niche listed all of the undergraduate colleges within the top 30 small colleges in the United States as measured by surveys rating various components of the undergraduate experience: Pomona College (#2), Harvey Mudd College (#5), Claremont McKenna College (#10), Scripps College (#22), and Pitzer College (#29). &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; also releases individual graduate program rankings for the Claremont Graduate University, with several of its programs ranking in the top tier of graduate programs nationwide.

== Shared facilities, programs, and resources ==

Each college is independent in that students receive their degrees from the one college in which they are enrolled, and administration and admissions departments are independent. The seven-institution Claremont Colleges system is supported by The Claremont Colleges Services (TCCS), which provides centralized services, such as a library, student health, financial and human resources, telecommunications, risk management, real estate, physical plant maintenance, and other services, for those colleges.

&lt;section begin=&quot;library holdings&quot; /&gt;The Claremont Colleges Library (also known as Honnold/Mudd Library) holds more than 2.7 million items , of which 1.1 million are physical and 1.7 million are digital.&lt;section end=&quot;library holdings&quot; /&gt;
Other shared facilities include Campus Safety, the Tranquada Student Services Center (which houses Baxter Medical Center, Monsour Counseling Center, and the Health Education Outreach), McAlister Center (home of the Office of the Chaplains and the Claremont Card Center), EmPOWER Center (which works to address sexual violence), the Huntley Bookstore, all dining facilities, and several sports facilities. &lt;section begin=&quot;Hive&quot; /&gt;The Sontag Center for Collaborative Creativity, colloquially termed &quot;the Hive&quot;, was established in 2015 to support creative learning.&lt;section end=&quot;Hive&quot; /&gt; The Claremont Colleges Library is an example of the level of cooperation in terms of support services. The size of the library collection ranks third among the private institutions in California, behind only Stanford and USC.

Shared academic departments include the Intercollegiate Women&#x27;s Studies Center, the Intercollegiate Department of Chicano Studies, the Intercollegiate Department of Asian American Studies, the Intercollegiate Department of Africana Studies (formerly Black Studies), the Intercollegiate Department of Religious Studies, the Intercollegiate Department of Media Studies, and the Five-College Theater Department. In January 2008, the Claremont Colleges also formed the Claremont Center for the Mathematical Sciences, which is led by the Claremont Graduate University and is a collaborative center for faculty members working in mathematics.

Shared intercollegiate programs include the European Union Center of California, the Chicano/Latino Student Affairs Center, the Office of Black Student Affairs, the Office of the Chaplains, Hillel, and the Queer Resource Center.
In addition, three of the Claremont Colleges—Claremont McKenna College, Pitzer College, and Scripps College—share a single science program. These three colleges pool their resources to create the largest academic department in Claremont, the Joint Science Department. Many research projects and courses use the Robert J. Bernard Field Station, an natural area which consists principally of the rare Coastal Sage Scrub ecosystem.

The Claremont Colleges have been praised by higher education experts for their high level of cooperation and the overall success of their model, although the colleges&#x27; differing financial resources have led to occasional tensions. They have influenced the operations of other consortia and collegiate universities, but their model remains unique with few other institutions operating comparably.

===Clubs and organizations===
Some extracurricular organizations on campus are specific to an individual college, whereas others are open to students at all 5Cs or 7Cs. In total, there are nearly 300 clubs and organizations across the 5Cs.

&lt;section begin=Media /&gt;There are several media organizations at the Claremont Colleges, the largest of which is &quot;The Student Life&quot;, the oldest college newspaper in Southern California. It publishes a weekly print edition as well as online content. Pomona also has a student-run radio station, KSPC. The &quot;Claremont Independent&quot;, a conservative magazine, has produced articles about the 5Cs&#x27; political culture that have been picked up by national conservative media outlets and drawn criticism from many students. &quot;The Golden Antlers&quot; publishes satirical content.&lt;section end=Media /&gt;

&lt;section begin=OTL /&gt;

On the Loose (OTL), the outing club of the 5Cs, sponsors trips to outdoors destinations. Its flagship event, an annual hike up Mount Baldy in swimwear or goofy costumes, can draw more than 100 participants. It is affiliated with the Outdoor Education Center of Pomona College (OEC), which lends equipment to students for free and provides outdoor leadership training.&lt;section end=&quot;OTL&quot; /&gt;

&lt;section begin=&quot;Performance groups&quot; /&gt;There are several dance groups on campus, including the Claremont Colleges Ballroom Dance Company (CCBDC), which has more than 130 dancers, making it the third-largest collegiate program in the U.S. It has won multiple national championships. The Pomona College Theater Department produces four mainstage productions and a dance concert each year, and there are several smaller student-run productions as well. The 5Cs have two improv groups, Without a Box and Underground Theatrical Institution (UTI).&lt;section end=&quot;Performance groups&quot; /&gt;

&lt;section begin=A capella /&gt;There are eight a cappella groups on campus. One, the Claremont Shades, hosts the annual SCAMFest concert, which draws singers from other Southern California colleges.&lt;section end=A capella /&gt;

==Comparison of undergraduate colleges==

==People==
Many notable people have been affiliated with the colleges as alumni, faculty, staff, and administrators. Coverage of them is divided into articles by college:

*List of Claremont Graduate University people
*List of Scripps College people
*List of Claremont McKenna College people
*List of Harvey Mudd College people
*List of Pitzer College people
*List of Keck Graduate Institute people

The CEO of The Claremont Colleges Services is Stig Lanesskog.

== Athletics ==
Pomona College and Pitzer College compete together as the Pomona-Pitzer (PP) Sagehens. Claremont McKenna College, Harvey Mudd College and Scripps College also compete together as the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps (CMS) Stags (for male teams) and Athenas (for female teams). The teams participate in NCAA Division III in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC). In the Division III Final Standings for the 2016-2017 academic year, Claremont-Mudd-Scripps ranked fourth nationally, while Pomona-Pitzer ranked 29th; they were the top two performers in the SCIAC. Culturally, the Claremont Colleges place less emphasis on sports than many other institutions.

===Club and intramural sports===
In addition to the varsity teams, there are several 5C club sports teams.

The roller hockey club, the Claremont Centaurs, won the Division 3 Championship of the West Coast Roller Hockey League in 2009–2010, 2010–2011, and 2011–2012.

The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rugby union both attended Division II Nationals in 2004 and 2006, and the men&#x27;s team (Claremont Colleges Lions) won the Division II national championship in 2010 and the National Small College championship in 2017 and 2019.

The women&#x27;s ultimate team reached Nationals in 2004, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and won the tournament in 2012, and the men&#x27;s ultimate frisbee were 2008 Southern California Sectional champions and 2011 Division III National champions.

Other club sports offered at the 5Cs include men&#x27;s lacrosse, field hockey, crew, and cycling.

<text>A janissary (, , ) was a member of the elite infantry units that formed the Ottoman sultan&#x27;s household troops. They were the first modern standing army, and perhaps the first infantry force in the world to be equipped with firearms, adopted during the reign of Murad II. The corps was established under either Sultans Orhan or Murad I, and dismantled by Mahmud II in 1826.

Janissaries began as elite corps made up through the &quot;devşirme&quot; system of child levy enslavement, by which indigenous European Christian boys, chiefly from the Balkans, were taken, levied, subjected to forced circumcision and forced conversion to Islam, and incorporated into the Ottoman army. They became famed for internal cohesion cemented by strict discipline and order. Unlike typical slaves, they were paid regular salaries. Forbidden to marry before the age of 40 or engage in trade, their complete loyalty to the Ottoman sultan was expected. By the seventeenth century, due to a dramatic increase in the size of the Ottoman standing army, the corps&#x27; initially strict recruitment policy was relaxed. Civilians bought their way into it in order to benefit from the improved socio-economic status it conferred upon them. Consequently, the corps gradually lost its military character, undergoing a process that has been described as &quot;civilianization&quot;.

The janissaries were a formidable military unit in the early centuries, but as Western Europe modernized its military organization and technology, the janissaries became a reactionary force that resisted all change within the Ottoman army. Steadily the Ottoman military power became outdated, but when the janissaries felt their privileges were being threatened, or outsiders wanted to modernize them, or they might be superseded by their cavalry rivals, they would rise in rebellion. By the time the janissaries were suppressed, it was too late for Ottoman military power to catch up with the West. The corps was abolished by Mahmud II in 1826 in the Auspicious Incident, in which 6,000 or more were executed.

==Origins and history==
The Janissary force was formed in the fourteenth century, either during the rule of Murad I (), the third sultan of the Ottoman Empire, or during the time of Murad&#x27;s father, Sultan Orhan (). The Ottoman state instituted a tax of one-fifth on all slaves taken in war, and from this pool of manpower the sultans first constructed the Janissary corps as a personal army loyal only to the Ottoman sultan.

From the 1380s to 1648, the Janissaries were gathered through the system, which was abolished in 1648. This was the taking (enslaving) of non-Muslim boys, notably Anatolian and Balkan Christians; Jews were never subject to &quot;&quot;. There is however evidence that Jews tried to enroll into the system. Jews were not allowed in the janissary army, and so in suspected cases, the entire batch would be sent to the Imperial Arsenal as indentured laborers. Ottoman documents from the levy of the winter of 1603-1604 from Bosnia and Albania wrote to draw attention to some children as possibly being Jewish (). According to the &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;, &quot;in early days, all Christians were enrolled indiscriminately. Later, those from what is now Albania, Bosnia, Greece and Bulgaria were preferred.&quot; Bektashism became the official order of the Janissary corps in 15th century.

The Janissaries were &#x27; (sing. &quot;kapıkulu&quot;), &quot;door servants&quot; or &quot;slaves of the Porte&quot;, neither freemen nor ordinary slaves (&#x27;). They were subjected to strict discipline, but were paid salaries and pensions upon retirement and formed their own distinctive social class. As such, they became one of the ruling classes of the Ottoman Empire, rivalling the Turkish aristocracy. The brightest of the Janissaries were sent to the palace institution, Enderun. Through a system of meritocracy, the Janissaries held enormous power, stopping all efforts to reform the military.

According to military historian Michael Antonucci and economic historians Glenn Hubbard and Tim Kane, the Turkish administrators would scour their regions (but especially the Balkans) every five years for the strongest sons of the sultan&#x27;s Christian subjects. These boys (usually between the ages of 10 and 20) were then taken from their parents, circumcised, and sent to Turkish families in the provinces to be raised as Muslims and learn Turkish language and customs. Once their military training began, they were subjected to severe discipline, being prohibited from growing a beard, taking up a skill other than soldiering, and marrying. As a result, the Janissaries were extremely well-disciplined troops and became members of the &quot;&quot; class, the first-class citizens or military class. Most were of non-Muslim origin because it was not permissible to enslave a Muslim.

It was a similar system to the Iranian Safavid, Afsharid, and Qajar era &quot;ghilmans&quot;, who were drawn from converted Circassians, Georgians, and Armenians, and in the same way as with the Ottoman&#x27;s Janissaries who had to replace the unreliable ghazis. They were initially created as a counterbalance to the tribal, ethnic and favoured interests the Qizilbash gave, which make a system imbalanced.

In the late 16th century, a sultan gave in to the pressures of the Corps and permitted Janissary children to become members of the Corps, a practice strictly forbidden for the previous 300 years. According to paintings of the era, they were also permitted to grow beards. Consequently, the formerly strict rules of succession became open to interpretation. While they advanced their own power, the Janissaries also helped to keep the system from changing in other progressive ways, and according to some scholars the corps shared responsibility for the political stagnation of Istanbul.

Greek historian Dimitri Kitsikis in his book &quot;Türk Yunan İmparatorluğu&quot; (&quot;Turco-Greek Empire&quot;) states that many Bosnian Christian families were willing to comply with the &quot;devşirme&quot; because it offered a possibility of social advancement. Conscripts could one day become Janissary colonels, statesmen who might one day return to their home region as governors, or even Grand Viziers or Beylerbeys (governor generals).

Some of the most famous Janissaries include George Kastrioti Skanderbeg, an Albanian feudal lord who defected and led a 25‑year Albanian revolt against the Ottomans. Another was Sokollu Mehmed Paşa, a Bosnian Serb who became a grand vizier, served three sultans, and was the de facto ruler of the Ottoman Empire for more than 14 years.

The Janissaries were no exception to the weakening of central imperial authority in the 18th century. Trade and commercial activity replaced the disciplined military service of earlier centuries, and the Janissaries were willing to engage in violent acts of rebellion to protect their private interests in an increasingly decentralized and chaotic Ottoman Empire.

==Characteristics==

The Janissary corps were distinctive in a number of ways. They wore unique uniforms, were paid regular salaries (including bonuses) for their service, marched to music (the mehter), lived in barracks and were the first corps to make extensive use of firearms. A Janissary battalion was a close-knit community, effectively the soldier&#x27;s family. By tradition, the Sultan himself, after authorizing the payments to the Janissaries, visited the barracks dressed as a janissary trooper, and received his pay alongside the other men of the First Division. They also served as policemen, palace guards, and firefighters during peacetime. The Janissaries also enjoyed far better support on campaign than other armies of the time. They were part of a well-organized military machine, in which one support corps prepared the roads while others pitched tents and baked the bread. Their weapons and ammunition were transported and re-supplied by the cebeci corps. They campaigned with their own medical teams of Muslim and Jewish surgeons and their sick and wounded were evacuated to dedicated mobile hospitals set up behind the lines.

These differences, along with an impressive war-record, made the Janissaries a subject of interest and study by foreigners during their own time. Although eventually the concept of a modern army incorporated and surpassed most of the distinctions of the Janissaries and the corps was eventually dissolved, the image of the Janissary has remained as one of the symbols of the Ottomans in the western psyche. By the mid-18th century, they had taken up many trades and gained the right to marry and enroll their children in the corps and very few continued to live in the barracks. Many of them became administrators and scholars. Retired or discharged Janissaries received pensions, and their children were also looked after.

==Recruitment, training and status==
The first Janissary units were formed from prisoners of war and slaves, probably as a result of the sultan taking his traditional one-fifth share of his army&#x27;s plunder in kind rather than monetarily; however, the continuing enslaving of dhimmi constituted a continuing abuse of a subject population. For a while, the Ottoman government supplied the Janissary corps with recruits from the devşirme system. Children were drafted at a young age and turned into soldiers in an attempt to make the soldiers faithful to the sultan. The social status of devşirme recruits took on an immediate positive change, acquiring a greater guarantee of governmental rights and financial opportunities. In poor areas officials were bribed by parents to make them take their sons, thus they would have better chances in life. Initially the recruiters favoured Greeks and Albanians. As borders of the Ottoman Empire expanded, the &quot;devşirme&quot; was extended to include Armenians, Bulgarians, Croats, Hungarians, Serbs, Romanians and later Bosniaks, and, in rare instances, Georgians, Circassians, Ukrainians, Poles and southern Russians.

This &quot;child levy&quot; system was regularly implemented during the 15th-16th centuries, the first two centuries of its existence. Some historians argue this system contributed to the Ottoman states efforts at conversion and &quot;Islamization&quot; of its non-Muslim populations. Radushev states this recruitment system can be bisected into two periods, its first, or classical period, encompassing those first two centuries of regular execution and utilization to supply recruits; and a second period which more focuses on its gradual change, decline, and ultimate abandonment, beginning in the 17th century.

In response to foreign threats, the Ottoman government chose to rapidly expand the size of the corps after the 1570s. Janissaries spent shorter periods of time in training as &quot;acemi oğlan&quot;s, as the average age of recruitment increased from 13.5 in the 1490s to 16.6 in 1603. This reflected not only the Ottomans&#x27; greater need for manpower but also the shorter training time necessary to produce skilled musketeers in comparison with archers. However, this change alone was not enough to produce the necessary manpower, and consequently the traditional limitation of recruitment to boys conscripted in the &quot;devşirme&quot; was lifted. Membership was opened up to free-born Muslims, both recruits hand-picked by the commander of the Janissaries, as well as the sons of current members of the Ottoman standing army. By the middle of the seventeenth century, the &quot;devşirme&quot; had largely been abandoned as a method of recruitment.

The prescribed daily rate of pay for entry-level Janissaries in the time of Ahmet I was three Akçes. Promotion to a cavalry regiment implied a minimum salary of 10 Akçes. Janissaries received a sum of 12 Akçes every three months for clothing incidentals and 30 Akçes for weaponry, with an additional allowance for ammunition as well.

For all practical purposes, Janissaries belonged to the sultan and they were regarded as the protectors of the throne and the sultan. Janissaries were taught to consider the corps their home and family, and the sultan as their father. Only those who proved strong enough earned the rank of true Janissary at the age of 24 or 25. The Odjak inherited the property of dead Janissaries, thus acquiring wealth. Janissaries also learned to follow the dictates of the dervish saint Haji Bektash Veli, disciples of whom had blessed the first troops. Bektashi Order served as a kind of chaplain for Janissaries. In this and in their secluded life, Janissaries resembled Christian military orders like the Knights Hospitaller. As a symbol of their devotion to the order, Janissaries wore special hats called &quot;börk&quot;. These hats also had a holding place in front, called the &quot;kaşıklık&quot;, for a spoon. This symbolized the &quot;kaşık kardeşliği&quot;, or the &quot;brotherhood of the spoon&quot;, which reflected a sense of comradeship among the Janissaries who ate, slept, fought and died together.

===Training===
When a non-Muslim boy was recruited under the devşirme system, he would first be sent to selected Turkish families in the provinces to learn Turkish, the rules of Islam (i.e. to be converted to Islam) and the customs and cultures of Ottoman society. After completing this period, acemi (new recruit) boys were gathered for training at the Enderun &quot;acemi oğlan&quot; school in the capital city. There, young cadets would be selected for their talents in different areas to train as engineers, artisans, riflemen, clerics, archers, artillery, and so forth. Janissaries trained under strict discipline with hard labour and in practically monastic conditions in &quot;acemi oğlan&quot; (&quot;rookie&quot; or &quot;cadet&quot;) schools, where they were expected to remain celibate. Unlike other Muslims, they were expressly forbidden to wear beards, only a moustache. These rules were obeyed by Janissaries, at least until the 18th century when they also began to engage in other crafts and trades, breaking another of the original rules. In the late 16th century a sultan gave in to the pressures of the Janissary Corps and permitted Janissary children to become members of the Corps, a practice strictly forbidden for 200 years. Consequently, succession rules, formerly strict, became open to interpretation. They gained their own power but kept the system from changing in other progressive ways.

Even after the rapid expansion of the size of the corps at the end of the sixteenth century, the Janissaries continued to undergo strict training and discipline. The Janissaries experimented with new forms of battlefield tactics, and in 1605 became one of the first armies in Europe to implement rotating lines of volley fire in battle.

==Organization==

The corps was organized into &quot;ortas&quot; (literally, &quot;centers&quot;). An &quot;orta&quot; (equivalent to a battalion) was headed by a çorbaci. All &quot;orta&quot;s together comprised the Janissary corps proper and its organization, named &quot;ocak&quot; (literally, &quot;hearth&quot;). Suleiman I had 165 &quot;orta&quot;s and the number increased over time to 196. While the Sultan was the supreme commander of the Ottoman Army and of the Janissaries in particular, the corps was organized and led by a commander, the &quot;ağa&quot;. The corps was divided into three sub-corps:
* the &quot;cemaat&quot; (frontier troops; also spelled &quot;jemaat&quot; in old sources), with 101 &quot;orta&quot;s
* the &quot;bölük&quot; or &quot;beylik&quot; (the Sultan&#x27;s own bodyguard), with 61 &quot;orta&quot;s
* the &quot;sekban&quot; or &quot;seymen&quot;, with 34 &quot;orta&quot;s

In addition there were also 34 &quot;orta&quot;s of the &quot;ajemi&quot; (cadets). A semi-autonomous Janissary corps was permanently based in Algiers, called the Odjak of Algiers.

Originally Janissaries could be promoted only through seniority and within their own &quot;orta&quot;. They could leave the unit only to assume command of another. Only Janissaries&#x27; own commanding officers could punish them. The rank names were based on positions in the kitchen staff or Sultan&#x27;s royal hunters; 64th and 65th Orta &#x27;Greyhound Keepers&#x27; comprised as the only Janissary cavalry, perhaps to emphasise that Janissaries were servants of the Sultan. Local Janissaries, stationed in a town or city for a long time, were known as yerliyyas.

==Corps strength==
Even though the Janissaries were part of the royal army and personal guards of the sultan, the corps was not the main force of the Ottoman military. In the classical period, Janissaries were only one-tenth of the overall Ottoman army, while the traditional Turkish cavalry made up the rest of the main battle force. According to David Nicolle, the number of Janissaries in the 14th century was 1,000 and about 6,000 in 1475. The same source estimates the number of Timarli Sipahi, the provincial cavalry which constituted the main force of the army at 40,000.

Beginning in the 1530s, the size of the Janissary corps began to dramatically expand, a result of the rapid conquests the Ottomans were carrying out during those years. Janissaries were used extensively to garrison fortresses and for siege warfare, which was becoming increasingly important for the Ottoman military. The pace of expansion increased after the 1570s, due to the initiation of a series of wars with the Safavid Empire and, after 1593, with the Habsburg monarchy. By 1609, the size of the corps had stabilized at approximately 40,000 men, but increased again later in the century, during the period of the Cretan War (1645–1669) and particularly the War of the Holy League (1683–1699).

==Equipment==
During the initial period of formation, Janissaries were expert archers, but they began adopting firearms as soon as such became available during the 1440s. The siege of Vienna in 1529 confirmed the reputation of their engineers, e.g. sappers, and miners. In melee combat, they used axes and kilijs. Originally in peacetime, they could carry only clubs or daggers, unless they served as border troops. Turkish yatagan swords were the signature weapon of the Janissaries, almost a symbol of the corps. Janissaries who guarded the palace (Zülüflü Baltacılar) carried long-shafted axes and halberds.

By the early 16th century, the Janissaries were equipped with and were skilled with muskets. In particular, they used a massive &quot;trench gun&quot;, firing an ball, which was &quot;feared by their enemies&quot;. Janissaries also made extensive use of early grenades and hand cannons, such as the abus gun. Pistols were not initially popular, but they became so after the Cretan War (1645–1669).

==Battles==
The Ottoman Empire used Janissaries in all its major campaigns, including the 1453 capture of Constantinople, the defeat of the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo and wars against Hungary and Austria. Janissary troops were always led to the battle by the Sultan himself, and always had a share of the loot. The Janissary corps was the only infantry division of the Ottoman army. In battle the Janissaries&#x27; main mission was to protect the Sultan, using cannon and smaller firearms, and holding the centre of the army against enemy attack during the strategic fake forfeit of Turkish cavalry. The Janissary corps also included smaller expert teams: explosive experts, engineers and technicians, sharpshooters (with arrow and rifle) and sappers who dug tunnels under fortresses, etc.

==Revolts and disbandment==

As Janissaries became aware of their own importance, they began to desire a better life. By the early 17th century, Janissaries had such prestige and influence that they dominated the government. They could mutiny, dictate policy, and hinder efforts to modernize the army structure. Additionally, the Janissaries found they could change Sultans as they wished through palace coups. New rules allowed them to own land and establish businesses. They would also limit the enlistment of new Janissaries to their own sons who did not have to go through the original training period in the &quot;acemi oğlan&quot;, as well as avoiding the physical selection, thereby reducing their military value. When Janissaries could practically extort money from the Sultan and business and family life replaced martial fervour, their effectiveness as combat troops decreased. The northern borders of the Ottoman Empire slowly began to shrink southwards after the second Battle of Vienna in 1683.

In 1449, they revolted for the first time, demanding higher wages, which they obtained. The stage was set for a decadent evolution, like that of the Streltsy of Tsar Peter&#x27;s Russia or that of the Praetorian Guard which proved the greatest threat to Roman emperors, rather than effective protection. After 1451, every new Sultan felt obligated to pay each Janissary a reward and raise his pay rank (although since early Ottoman times, every other member of the Topkapi court received a pay raise as well). Sultan Selim II gave Janissaries permission to marry in 1566, undermining the exclusivity of loyalty to the dynasty. By 1622, the Janissaries were a &quot;serious threat&quot; to the stability of the Empire. Through their &quot;greed and indiscipline&quot;, they were now a law unto themselves and, against modern European armies, ineffective on the battlefield as a fighting force. In 1622, the teenage Sultan Osman II, after a defeat during war against Poland, determined to curb Janissaries&#x27; excesses. Outraged at becoming &quot;subject to his own slaves&quot;, he tried to disband the Janissary corps, blaming it for the disaster during the Polish war. In the spring, hearing rumours that the Sultan was preparing to move against them, the Janissaries revolted and took the Sultan captive, imprisoning him in the notorious Seven Towers: he was murdered shortly afterward.


The extravagant parties of the Ottoman ruling classes during the Tulip Period caused a lot of unrest among the Ottoman population. In September 1730, janissaries headed by Patrona Halil backed in Istanbul a rebellion by 12,000 Albanian troops which caused the abdication of Sultan Ahmed III and the death of the Grand Vizier Damad Ibrahim. The rebellion was crushed in three weeks with the massacre of 7,000 rebels, but it marked the end of the Tulip Era and the beginning of Sultan Mahmud I&#x27;s reign. In 1804, the Dahias, the Janissary junta that ruled Serbia at the time, having taken power in the &#x27;lSanjak of Smederevo in defiance of the Sultan, feared that the Sultan would make use of the Serbs to oust them. To forestall this they decided to execute all prominent nobles throughout Central Serbia, a move known as the Slaughter of the Knezes. According to historical sources of the city of Valjevo, the heads of the murdered men were put on public display in the central square to serve as an example to those who might plot against the rule of the Janissaries. The event triggered the start of the Serbian Revolution with the First Serbian Uprising aimed at putting an end to the 370 years of Ottoman occupation of modern Serbia.

In 1807, a Janissary revolt deposed Sultan Selim III, who had tried to modernize the army along Western European lines. This modern army that Selim III created was called Nizam-ı Cedid. His supporters failed to recapture power before Mustafa IV had him killed, but elevated Mahmud II to the throne in 1808. When the Janissaries threatened to oust Mahmud II, he had the captured Mustafa executed and eventually came to a compromise with the Janissaries. Ever mindful of the threat that the Janissaries posed, the sultan spent the next years discreetly securing his position. The Janissaries&#x27; abuse of power, military ineffectiveness, resistance to reform, and the cost of salaries to 135,000 men, many of whom were not actually serving soldiers, had all become intolerable.

By 1826, the sultan was ready to move against the Janissaries in favour of a more modern military. The sultan informed them, through a fatwa, that he was forming a new army, organised and trained along modern European lines. As predicted, they mutinied, advancing on the sultan&#x27;s palace. In the ensuing fight, the Janissaries&#x27; barracks were set aflame by artillery fire, resulting in 4,000 Janissary fatalities. The survivors were either exiled or executed, and their possessions were confiscated by the Sultan. This event is now called the Auspicious Incident. The last of the Janissaries were then put to death by decapitation in what was later called the Tower of Blood, in Thessaloniki.

After the Janissaries were disbanded by Mahmud II, he then created a new army soon after recruiting 12,000 troops. This new army was formally named the Trained Victorious Soldiers of Muhammad, the Mansure Army for short. By 1830, the army expanded to 27,000 troops and included the Sipahi cavalry. By 1838, all Ottoman fighting corps were included and the army changed its name to the Ordered troops. This military corps lasted until the end of the empire&#x27;s history.

==Janissary music==

The military music of the Janissaries was noted for its powerful percussion and shrill winds combining &quot;kös&quot; (giant timpani), &quot;davul&quot; (bass drum), &quot;zurna&quot; (a loud shawm), &quot;naffir&quot;, or &quot;boru&quot; (natural trumpet), &quot;çevgan&quot; bells, triangle (a borrowing from Europe), and cymbals (&quot;zil&quot;), among others. Janissary music influenced European classical musicians such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven, both of whom composed music in the Turkish style. Examples include Mozart&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 11 (c. 1783), Beethoven&#x27;s incidental music for &quot;The Ruins of Athens&quot; (1811), and the final movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9, although the Beethoven example is now considered a march rather than Alla turca.

Sultan Mahmud II abolished the &quot;mehter&quot; band in 1826 along with the Janissary corps. Mahmud replaced the mehter band in 1828 with a European style military band trained by Giuseppe Donizetti. In modern times, although the Janissary corps no longer exists as a professional fighting force, the tradition of Mehter music is carried on as a cultural and tourist attraction.

In 1952, the Janissary military band, &quot;Mehterân&quot;, was organized again under the auspices of the Istanbul Military Museum. They hold performances during some national holidays as well as in some parades during days of historical importance. For more details, see Turkish music (style) and Mehter.

<text>Lake Travis is a reservoir on the Colorado River in central Texas in the United States. It is named in honor of William B. Travis.

Serving principally as a flood-control reservoir, Lake Travis&#x27; historical minimum to maximum water height change is nearly 100 feet. Following the 2018 Llano River flood, Lake Travis saw a 20-foot depth increase within a single 24-hour period of time. With 30 square miles of surface area, Lake Travis has the largest storage capacity of the seven reservoirs known as the Highland Lakes, and stretches 65 miles (105 km) upriver from western Travis County (near Lago Vista, Texas) in a highly serpentine course into southern Burnet County to Max Starcke Dam, southwest of the town of Marble Falls. Besides being used for flood control and as a water supply, the lake is also used for electrical power generation and recreation.

The Pedernales River, a major tributary of the Colorado River, flows into the lake from southwestern Travis County.

== History ==

=== Creation ===
The reservoir was formed in 1942 by the construction of Mansfield Dam on the western edge of Austin, Texas by the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA), and was built specifically to contain floodwaters in a flash-flood prone region. During its construction, after a severe flood in July 1938, the height of the dam was raised to add storage capacity for floodwaters.

=== Ferry service ===
Regularly scheduled ferry service between Point Venture and the south side of Hurst Creek began in April 1971, operated by Point Venture Development Co. The trip took 20 minutes and was the only inland ferry service in Texas at the time.

=== September 2020 boat sinkings ===
On September 5, 2020, a boat parade took place in support of Donald Trump. The Travis County Sheriff&#x27;s office reported that they had received multiple calls involving boats in distress, and that several boats had sunk. The weather was calm, but the boats generated significant wake as they began to move together, which subsequently sank at least five boats. The hashtag #dumbkirk trended on Twitter following the incident.

== Recreational uses==

Lake Travis is well known for its outdoor recreation opportunities, including fishing, boating, swimming, scuba diving, picnicking, camping, and zip lining. Hippie Hollow Park, located near the eastern end of Lake Travis, is the only legal clothing optional park in Texas. Lake Travis is generally considered one of the clearest lakes in Texas. It is a vital water supply for the nearby city of Austin, Texas and the surrounding metropolitan area.

===Fatality rankings===
In a ranking of Texas lakes by accidental fatalities, Lake Travis was in first place in 2011 and tied for second place for total deaths from 2000–2015.

Six people drowned in Lake Travis in 2018, out of 29 total boating deaths reported across Texas that year.

=== Fish populations ===
Lake Travis has been stocked with several species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. Fish present in Lake Travis include largemouth bass, guadalupe bass, white bass, striped bass, catfish and sunfish. Lake Travis is a popular fishing destination for anglers in Texas not only because of its stocked inventory but because of the convenient boating services and marinas in the area.

In spring 2008 there were several reports of leeches residing in Lake Travis. The leeches are generally harmless to humans but can be a nuisance.

==Lake levels==

Lake Travis is considered &quot;full&quot; (at maximum desired capacity) when the lake&#x27;s water level is at above mean sea level (msl). Above , flood control gates at Mansfield Dam are opened under the direction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

The level of the lake can vary dramatically—with an over 96-foot range between its historical high and low—depending on the amount of rainfall in the Colorado River basin upstream. The historic high level on the lake was above msl on December 25, 1991, a little less than four feet below the dam&#x27;s top/spillway at above msl. The historic low was above msl on August 14, 1951.

===Droughts===
The extreme drought of 2008–2009 brought the lake to its fourth lowest level at above msl in November 2009. The second lowest level was above msl on November 8, 1963. During the 2010–13 Southern United States drought, levels went as low as 618 feet, making it the third lowest level ever. The LCRA, a public utility whose responsibilities include the management of Lake Travis, makes water level reports available on the internet. In April 2016, the lake returned to its full capacity at 681 ft.

===Floods===
Lake Travis serves as the primary flood control reservoir of the Highland Lake chain. The LCRA, under advisement from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is responsible for floodgate operations at Mansfield Dam. Ideally, this is done in a time-delayed fashion after a major rainfall so as to either mitigate or outright prevent downstream flooding which otherwise would have been both immediate and extreme without the dam&#x27;s presence. As Lake Travis levels increase during major floods, floodgate operations are conducted to protect property around Lake Travis as well as the dam itself.

While the dam&#x27;s physical design assists in its own protection during floods, extensive spillway operations, a worst-case scenario which has not happened in the lake&#x27;s history, could undermine the dam&#x27;s base and affect its overall integrity. Under such conditions, operations are primarily intended to protect the dam, and lake water may be released to the dam&#x27;s full, 24-floodgate capacity—regardless of downstream effects—to prevent the catastrophic loss of the dam. Including its hydroelectric generators but not the spillway, at 681 feet above msl the dam&#x27;s total maximum discharge capacity is more than 130,000 cubic feet per second (cfs); a bit under one million gallons per second. Rates of discharge increase as water levels/pressures increase.

<doc id="166313" wikidata="Q1128082" url="?curid=166313" title="Lake Austin">
<text>Lake Austin, formerly Lake McDonald, is a water reservoir on the Colorado River in Austin, Texas. The reservoir was formed in 1939 by the construction of Tom Miller Dam by the Lower Colorado River Authority. Lake Austin is one of the seven Highland Lakes created by the LCRA, and is used for flood control, electrical power generation, and recreation.

==Hydrology==

Lake Austin is a part of Texas&#x27; Colorado River; it begins below Mansfield Dam and is principally fed by the outflow of Lake Travis. The lake meanders generally from northwest to southeast, with few significant tributaries; the largest are Bull Creek, entering from the north near where Loop 360 spans the lake at the Pennybacker Bridge, and Bee Creek, entering from the west just above Tom Miller Dam, where the lake ends. Its outflow through Tom Miller Dam then becomes the principal inflow for Lady Bird Lake.

Lake Austin is maintained as a constant-level lake by releases of water from Lake Travis upstream. The other Highland Lake reservoirs on the Colorado River are Lake Buchanan, Inks Lake, Lake LBJ, Lake Marble Falls, and Lake Travis upstream, and Lady Bird Lake downstream.

==History==
The first lake on the same site was named Lake McDonald, a reservoir formed by the construction of Austin Dam between 1890 and 1893. In 1900 a heavy rainstorm overwhelmed and destroyed the first Austin Dam, causing extensive flooding. The dam began to be rebuilt in 1915, but repairs were abandoned because of a contract dispute, and the unfinished dam was again destroyed in a heavy storm later that year. In 1938 the Lower Colorado River Authority began building the Tom Miller Dam; the dam was completed and the lake filled in 1939.

==Recreational uses==
Lake Austin is a popular fishing and boating destination.

===Boating===
Numerous companies rent out sailboats, motorboats, jet skis/waverunners, canoes, pontoon boats, and large party boats in the Austin area.

The Austin Parks and Recreation Department offers classes in canoeing, kayaking, and sailing.

===Fish and wildlife populations===
Lake Austin has been stocked with several species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. The lake is considered to have an excellent stock of largemouth bass. Other fish present include catfish and sunfish.

Lake Austin is one of the Texas Highland Lakes infested with hydrilla, a non-native aquatic plant species. The Lower Colorado River Authority has intentionally lowered the water levels in the lake in the months of January and February so that freezing air temperatures might destroy substantial portions of the hydrilla in the lake each winter. As of March 2014, hydrilla has been completely eliminated from the lake through the stocking of Asian grass carp by the City of Austin. As of September 2016 the grass carp released into Lake Austin have begun to devastate the lake’s natural resources. This has led to a decline in the wildlife native to this section of the Colorado River.

<doc id="166314" wikidata="Q201966" url="?curid=166314" title="Ulster Scots dialect">
<text>Ulster Scots or Ulster-Scots (, ), also known as Ulster Scotch and Ullans, is the dialect (whose proponents assert is a dialect of Scots) spoken in parts of Ulster, being almost exclusively spoken in parts of Northern Ireland and County Donegal. It is normally considered a dialect or group of dialects of Scots, although groups such as the Ulster-Scots Language Society and Ulster-Scots Academy consider it a language in its own right, and the Ulster-Scots Agency and former Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure have used the term Ulster-Scots language.

Some definitions of Ulster Scots may also include Standard English spoken with an Ulster Scots accent. This is a situation like that of Lowland Scots and Scottish Standard English with words pronounced using the Ulster Scots phonemes closest to those of Standard English.
Ulster Scots has been influenced by Hiberno-English, particularly Ulster English, and by Ulster Irish. As a result of the competing influences of English and Scots, varieties of Ulster Scots can be described as &quot;more English&quot; or &quot;more Scots&quot;.

==Names==
While once referred to as &quot;Scotch-Irish&quot; by several researchers, that has now been superseded by the term &quot;Ulster Scots&quot;. Speakers usually refer to their vernacular as &#x27;Big Scots&#x27;, &#x27;Scotch&#x27; or &#x27;the hamely tongue&#x27;. Since the 1980s &quot;Ullans&quot;, a neologism popularized by the physician, amateur historian and politician Ian Adamson, merging &quot;Ulster&quot; and &quot;Lallans&quot;, the Scots for &quot;Lowlands&quot;, but also an acronym for &quot;Ulster-Scots language in literature and native speech&quot; and &quot;Ulstèr-Scotch&quot;, the preferred revivalist parlance, have also been used. Occasionally, the term &quot;Habitual-Scots&quot; appears, whether for the vernacular or the ethnic group.

==Speaker population and spread==

During the middle of the 20th century, the linguist Robert John Gregg established the geographical boundaries of Ulster&#x27;s Scots-speaking areas based on information gathered from native speakers. By his definition, Ulster Scots is spoken in mid and east Antrim, north Down, north-east County Londonderry, and in the fishing villages of the Mourne coast. It is also spoken in the Laggan district and parts of the Finn Valley in east Donegal and in the south of Inishowen in north Donegal. Writing in 2020, the Fintona-born linguist Warren Maguire argued that some of the criteria that Gregg used as distinctive of Ulster Scots are common in south-west Tyrone and were found in other sites across Northern Ireland investigated by the Linguistic Survey of Scotland.

The 1999 Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey found that 2% of Northern Ireland residents claimed to speak Ulster Scots, which would mean a total speech community of approximately 30,000 in the territory. Other estimates range from 35,000 in Northern Ireland, to an &quot;optimistic&quot; total of 100,000 including the Republic of Ireland (mainly the east of County Donegal). Speaking at a seminar on 9 September 2004, Ian Sloan of the Northern Ireland Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) accepted that the 1999 Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey &quot;did not significantly indicate that unionists or nationalists were relatively any more or less likely to speak Ulster Scots, although in absolute terms there were more unionists who spoke Ulster Scots than nationalists&quot;.

In the 2021 census of Northern Ireland, 20,930 people (1.14% of the population) stated that they can speak, read, write and understand Ulster Scots, 26,570 people (1.45% of the population) stated they can speak but cannot read or write Ulster Scots, and 190,613 people (10.38% of the population) reported having some knowledge of it.

==Status==
===Linguistic status===

The majority of linguists treat Ulster Scots as a variety of the Scots language; Caroline Macafee, for example, writes that &quot;Ulster Scots is [...] clearly a dialect of Central Scots.&quot; The Northern Ireland Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure considers Ulster Scots to be &quot;the local variety of the Scots language.&quot; Some linguists, such as Raymond Hickey, treat Ulster Scots (and other forms of Scots) as a dialect of English. It has been said that its &quot;status varies between dialect and language&quot;.

Enthusiasts such as Philip Robinson (author of &quot;Ulster-Scots: a Grammar of the Traditional Written and Spoken Language&quot;), the Ulster-Scots Language Society and supporters of an Ulster-Scots Academy are of the opinion that Ulster Scots is a language in its own right. That position has been criticised by the Ulster-Scots Agency, with a BBC report stating: &quot;[The Agency] accused the academy of wrongly promoting Ulster-Scots as a language distinct from Scots.&quot; This position is reflected in many of the academic responses to the &quot;Public Consultation on Proposals for an Ulster-Scots Academy&quot;

===Legal status===

Ulster Scots is defined in an &quot;Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland establishing implementation bodies done at Dublin on the 8th day of March 1999&quot; in the following terms:

The North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) Northern Ireland Order 1999, which gave effect to the implementation bodies incorporated the text of the agreement in its Schedule 1.

The declaration made by the British Government regarding the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages reads as follows:

This recognition differed significantly from the commitments entered into under the Charter in relation to Irish, for which specific provisions under Part III were invoked for the protection and promotion of that language. The definition of Ullans from the North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) Northern Ireland Order 1999 above was used on 1 July 2005 Second Periodical Report by the United Kingdom to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe outlining how the UK met its obligations under the Charter.

The Good Friday Agreement (which does not refer to Ulster Scots as a &quot;language&quot;) recognises Ulster Scots as &quot;part of the cultural wealth of the island of Ireland&quot;, and the Implementation Agreement established the cross-border Ulster-Scots Agency (&quot;Tha Boord o Ulstèr-Scotch&quot;).

The legislative remit laid down for the agency by the North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) Northern Ireland Order 1999 is: &quot;the promotion of greater awareness and the use of Ullans and of Ulster-Scots cultural issues, both within Northern Ireland and throughout the island&quot;.

The agency has adopted a mission statement: &quot;to promote the study, conservation, development and use of Ulster Scots as a living language; to encourage and develop the full range of its attendant culture; and to promote an understanding of the history of the Ulster-Scots people.&quot; Despite the Agency&#x27;s reference to Ulster Scots as &quot;a language&quot;, this eliding of the distinction between Ulster Scots as a linguistic form, and &quot;Ulster Scots culture&quot; broadly referring to cultural forms associated with the Scottish-descended population, continued thereafter.

The Northern Ireland (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006 amended the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to insert a section (28D) entitled &quot;Strategies relating to Irish language and Ulster Scots language etc.&quot; which inter alia laid on the Executive Committee a duty to &quot;adopt a strategy setting out how it proposes to enhance and develop the Ulster Scots language, heritage and culture.&quot; This reflects the wording used in the St Andrews Agreement to refer to the enhancement and development of &quot;the Ulster Scots language, heritage and culture&quot;. There is still controversy on the status of Ulster Scots.

==History and literature==

Scots, mainly Gaelic-speaking, had been settling in Ulster since the 15th century, but large numbers of Scots-speaking Lowlanders, some 200,000, arrived during the 17th century following the 1610 Plantation, with the peak reached during the 1690s. In the core areas of Scots settlement, Scots outnumbered English settlers by five or six to one.

Literature from shortly before the end of the unselfconscious tradition at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries is almost identical with contemporary writing from Scotland. W. G. Lyttle, writing in &quot;Paddy McQuillan&#x27;s Trip Tae Glesco&quot;, uses the typically Scots forms &quot;kent&quot; and &quot;begood&quot;, now replaced in Ulster by the more mainstream Anglic forms &quot;knew&quot;, &quot;knowed&quot; or &quot;knawed&quot; and &quot;begun&quot;. Many of the modest contemporary differences between Scots as spoken in Scotland and Ulster may be due to dialect levelling and influence from Mid Ulster English brought about through relatively recent demographic change rather than direct contact with Irish, retention of older features or separate development.

The earliest identified writing in Scots in Ulster dates from 1571: a letter from Agnes Campbell of County Tyrone to Queen Elizabeth on behalf of Turlough O&#x27;Neil, her husband. Although documents dating from the Plantation period show conservative Scots features, English forms started to predominate from the 1620s as Scots declined as a written medium.

In Ulster Scots-speaking areas there was traditionally a considerable demand for the work of Scottish poets, often in locally printed editions. These include Alexander Montgomerie&#x27;s &quot;The Cherrie and the Slae&quot; in 1700; shortly over a decade later an edition of poems by Sir David Lindsay; nine printings of Allan Ramsay&#x27;s &quot;The Gentle shepherd&quot; between 1743 and 1793; and an edition of Robert Burns&#x27; poetry in 1787, the same year as the Edinburgh edition, followed by reprints in 1789, 1793 and 1800. Among other Scottish poets published in Ulster were James Hogg and Robert Tannahill.
That was complemented by a poetry revival and nascent prose genre in Ulster, which started around 1720. The most prominent of these was the &quot;rhyming weaver&quot; poetry, of which, some 60 to 70 volumes were published between 1750 and 1850, the peak being in the decades 1810 to 1840, although the first printed poetry (in the Habbie stanza form) by an Ulster Scots writer was published in a broadsheet in Strabane in 1735. These weaver poets looked to Scotland for their cultural and literary models and were not simple imitators but clearly inheritors of the same literary tradition following the same poetic and orthographic practices; it is not always immediately possible to distinguish traditional Scots writing from Scotland and Ulster. Among the &quot;rhyming weavers&quot; were James Campbell (1758–1818), James Orr (1770–1816), Thomas Beggs (1749–1847), David Herbison (1800–1880), Hugh Porter (1780–1839) and Andrew McKenzie (1780–1839).

Scots was also used in the narrative by Ulster novelists such as W. G. Lyttle (1844–1896) and Archibald McIlroy (1860–1915). By the middle of the 19th century the &quot;Kailyard school&quot; of prose had become the dominant literary genre, overtaking poetry. This was a tradition shared with Scotland which continued into the early 20th century. Scots also frequently appeared in Ulster newspaper columns, especially in Antrim and Down, in the form of pseudonymous social commentary employing a folksy first-person style. The pseudonymous Bab M&#x27;Keen (probably successive members of the Weir family: John Weir, William Weir, and Jack Weir) provided comic commentaries in the &quot;Ballymena Observer and County Antrim Advertiser&quot; for over a hundred years from the 1880s.
A somewhat diminished tradition of vernacular poetry survived into the 20th century in the work of poets such as Adam Lynn, author of the 1911 collection &quot;Random Rhymes frae Cullybackey&quot;, John Stevenson (died 1932), writing as &quot;Pat M&#x27;Carty&quot;, and John Clifford (1900–1983) from East Antrim. In the late 20th century the poetic tradition was revived, albeit often replacing the traditional Modern Scots orthographic practice with a series of contradictory idiolects. Among the significant writers is James Fenton, mostly using a blank verse form, but also occasionally the Habbie stanza. He employs an orthography that presents the reader with the difficult combination of eye dialect, dense Scots, and a greater variety of verse forms than employed hitherto. The poet Michael Longley (born 1939) has experimented with Ulster Scots for the translation of Classical verse, as in his 1995 collection &quot;The Ghost Orchid&quot;. The writing of Philip Robinson (born 1946) has been described as verging on &quot;post-modern kailyard&quot;. He has produced a trilogy of novels &quot;Wake the Tribe o Dan&quot; (1998), &quot;The Back Streets o the Claw&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Man frae the Ministry&quot; (2005), as well as story books for children &quot;Esther, Quaen o tha Ulidian Pechts&quot; and &quot;Fergus an tha Stane o Destinie&quot;, and two volumes of poetry &quot;Alang the Shore&quot; (2005) and &quot;Oul Licht, New Licht&quot; (2009).

A team in Belfast has begun translating portions of the Bible into Ulster Scots. The Gospel of Luke was published in 2009 by the Ullans Press. It is available in the YouVersion Bible Project.

===Since the 1990s===
In 1992 the Ulster-Scots Language Society was formed for the protection and promotion of Ulster Scots, which some of its members viewed as a language in its own right, encouraging use in speech, writing and in all areas of life.

Within the terms of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages the British Government is obliged, among other things, to:
*Facilitate and/or encourage of the use of Scots in speech and writing, in public and private life.
*Provide appropriate forms and means for the teaching and study of the language at all appropriate stages.
*Provide facilities enabling non-speakers living where the language is spoken to learn it if they so desire.
*Promote study and research of the language at universities of equivalent institutions.

The Ulster-Scots Agency, funded by DCAL in conjunction with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, is responsible for promotion of greater awareness and use of Ullans and of Ulster-Scots cultural issues, both within Northern Ireland and throughout the island. The agency was established as a result of the Belfast Agreement of 1998. Its headquarters are on Great Victoria Street in central Belfast, while the agency has a major office in Raphoe, County Donegal.

In 2001 the Institute of Ulster Scots Studies was established at the University of Ulster.

An Ulster Scots Academy has been planned with the aim of conserving, developing, and teaching the language of Ulster-Scots in association with native speakers to the highest academic standards.

The 2010 documentary &quot;The Hamely Tongue&quot; by filmmaker Deaglán O Mocháin traces back the origins of this culture and language, and relates its manifestations in today&#x27;s Ireland.

====New orthographies====

By the early 20th century the literary tradition was almost extinct, though some &#x27;dialect&#x27; poetry continued to be written. Much revivalist Ulster Scots has appeared, for example as &quot;official translations&quot;, since the 1990s. However, it has little in common with traditional Scots orthography as described in Grant and Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Manual of Modern Scots&quot; (1921). Aodán Mac Póilin, an Irish language activist, has described these revivalist orthographies as an attempt to make Ulster Scots an independent written language and to achieve official status. They seek &quot;to be as different to English (and occasionally Scots) as possible&quot;. He described it as a hotchpotch of obsolete words, neologisms (example: for &quot;vacuum cleaner&quot;), redundant spellings (example: for &quot;who&quot;) and &quot;erratic spelling&quot;. This spelling &quot;sometimes reflects everyday Ulster Scots speech rather than the conventions of either modern or historic Scots, and sometimes does not&quot;. The result, Mac Póilin writes, is &quot;often incomprehensible to the native speaker&quot;. In 2000, John Kirk described the &quot;net effect&quot; of that &quot;amalgam of traditional, surviving, revived, changed, and invented features&quot; as an &quot;artificial dialect&quot;. He added,It is certainly not a written version of the vestigial spoken dialect of rural County Antrim, as its activists frequently urge, perpetrating the fallacy that it&#x27;s &quot;wor ain leid&quot;. (Besides, the dialect revivalists claim not to be native speakers of the dialect themselves!) The colloquialness of this new dialect is deceptive, for it is neither spoken nor innate. Traditional dialect speakers find it counter-intuitive and false...

In 2005, Gavin Falconer questioned officialdom&#x27;s complicity, writing: &quot;The readiness of Northern Ireland officialdom to consign taxpayers&#x27; money to a black hole of translations incomprehensible to ordinary users is worrying&quot;. Recently produced teaching materials, have, on the other hand, been evaluated more positively.

===Sample texts===
The three text excerpts below illustrate how the traditional written form of Ulster Scots from the 18th to early 20th century was virtually indistinguishable from contemporary written Scots from Scotland.

&quot;The Muse Dismissed&quot; (Hugh Porter 1780–1839)

:Be hush&#x27;d my Muse, ye ken the morn
:Begins the shearing o&#x27; the corn,
:Whar knuckles monie a risk maun run,
:An&#x27; monie a trophy&#x27;s lost an&#x27; won,
:Whar sturdy boys wi&#x27; might and main
:Shall camp, till wrists an&#x27; thumbs they strain,
:While pithless, pantin&#x27; wi&#x27; the heat,
:They bathe their weazen&#x27;d pelts in sweat
:To gain a sprig o&#x27; fading fame,
:Before they taste the dear-bought cream—
:But bide ye there, my pens an&#x27; papers,
:For I maun up, an&#x27; to my scrapers—
:Yet, min&#x27;, my lass— ye maun return
:This very night we cut the churn.

&quot;To M.H.&quot; (Barney Maglone 1820?–1875)

:This wee thing&#x27;s o&#x27; little value,
::But for a&#x27; that it may be
:Guid eneuch to gar you, lassie,
::When you read it, think o&#x27; me.

:Think o&#x27; whan we met and parted,
::And o&#x27; a&#x27; we felt atween—
:Whiles sae gleesome, whiles doon-hearted—
::In yon cosy neuk at e&#x27;en.

:Think o&#x27; when we dander&#x27;t
::Doon by Bangor and the sea;
:How yon simmer day, we wander&#x27;t
::&#x27;Mang the fields o&#x27; Isle Magee.

:Think o&#x27; yon day&#x27;s gleefu&#x27; daffin&#x27;
::(Weel I wot ye mind it still)
:Whan we had sic slips and lauchin&#x27;,
::Spielin&#x27; daftly up Cave Hill.

:Dinna let your e&#x27;en be greetin&#x27;
::Lassie, whan ye think o&#x27; me,
:Think upo&#x27; anither meetin&#x27;,
::Aiblins by a lanward sea.

From &quot;The Lammas Fair&quot; (Robert Huddleston 1814–1889)

:Tae sing the day, tae sing the fair,
::That birkies ca&#x27; the lammas;
:In aul&#x27; Belfast, that toun sae rare,
::Fu&#x27; fain wad try&#x27;t a gomas.
:Tae think tae please a&#x27;, it were vain,
::And for a country plain boy;
:Therefore, tae please mysel&#x27; alane,
::Thus I began my ain way,
:::::Tae sing that day.

:Ae Monday morn on Autumn&#x27;s verge
::To view a scene so gay,
:I took my seat beside a hedge,
::To loiter by the way.
:Lost Phoebus frae the clouds o&#x27; night,
::Ance mair did show his face—
:Ance mair the Emerald Isle got light,
::Wi&#x27; beauty, joy, an&#x27; grace;
::::Fu&#x27; nice that day.

The examples below illustrate how 21st century Ulster Scots texts seldom adhere to the previous literary tradition, &quot;Yer guide tae the cheenge-ower&quot;, perhaps being a rare exception. Instead there has been an increase in the use of somewhat creative phonetic spellings based on the perceived sound-to-letter correspondences of Standard English, i.e. dialect writing, as exemplified in &quot;Alice&#x27;s Carrànts in Wunnerlan&quot; or the adoption of a more esoteric &quot;amalgam of traditional, surviving, revived, changed, and invented features&quot; as exemplified in &quot;Hannlin Rede&quot;.

From &quot;Yer guide tae the cheenge-ower&quot; (digitaluk 2012)

:Dae A need a new aerial?
:Gin ye hae guid analogue reception the nou, ye&#x27;r like no tae need tae replace yer ruiftap or set-tap aerial for the cheenge-ower – thare nae sic thing as a &#x27;deegital aerial&#x27;. But gin ye hae ill analogue reception the nou, ye&#x27;ll mebbe need tae replace it.
:Find oot by gaun til the aerial-pruifer on Teletext page 284. Anither wey is tae wait until efter the cheenge-ower for tae see if yer pictur&#x27;s affect.

From &quot;Alice&#x27;s Carrànts in Wunnerlan&quot; (Anne Morrison-Smyth, 2013)

:The Caterpillar an Alice lukt at ither fur a quare while wi&#x27;oot taakin: finally the Caterpillar tuk the hookah oot o its mooth, an spoke tae hir in a languid, dozy voice.
:&quot;Wha ir yae?&quot; said the Caterpillar.
:This wusnae a pooerfu guid openin fur a yarn. Alice answert brev an baakwardly, &quot;A—A harly know, Sir, jest at this minute—at least A know wha A wus this moarnin, but heth, A hae bin changed a wheen o times since thin.&quot;
:&quot;What dae yae mean bae that?&quot; said the Caterpillar sternly. &quot;Explain yersel!&quot;
:&quot;A cannae explain maesel, A&#x27;m feart, Sir,&quot; said Alice, &quot;baecaas A&#x27;m naw maesel, yae see.&quot;
:&quot;A dinnae see,&quot; said the Caterpillar.
:&quot;A cannae mak it onie mair clear,&quot; Alice answer, while polite, &quot;fur A cannae unnerstan it maesel tae stairt wi; an baein sae monie different sizes in yin dae haes turnt mae heid.&quot;

From &quot;Hannlin Rede&quot; [annual report] &quot;2012–2013&quot; (&quot;Männystèr o Fairms an Kintra Fordèrin&quot;, 2012)

<text>Ottoman military reforms began in the late 18th century.

== Formations ==

=== Kapikulu ===

==== Infantry ====

===== Janissary Corps =====
The Janissary Corps had long been the mainstay of the Ottoman infantry and remained so until its disbandment in 1826. However, estimates of the strength of the Corps vary greatly: by 1790, some 12,000 (2,000 combat) were said to reside in Istanbul alone, yet when summoned for campaign in 1810, only 13,000 assembled. Various other estimates place the total strength between 150,000 and 400,000, of which only 50,000 actually served as soldiers (with the remainder collecting pay but refusing to fight). 
Despite their backwardness in terms of combat, the Corps possessed immense &quot;espirit-de-corps&quot;, showing great initiative and often fighting to the death. While engaged in combat, the Janissaries would at times mock Western soldiers for their tendency to fight in close order formations. Their older matchlock muskets, despite being slower to fire, were preferred over newer flintlocks, on account of their greater range and accuracy.

===== Bostanji =====

These were the palace guards of the empire and numbered no more than a few thousand throughout the period and were an elite reserve around Edirne and Istanbul.

===== Other formations =====
The Bosnians were organised into the &quot;panduks&quot; and the Anatolian Turks into the Sekban. The Tufenkis who were mounted infantry were largely Kurdish in origin.

==== Cavalry ====
The Sipahis, traditionally paid by Timars, had degenerated considerably by the 18th century, shrinking from an earlier peak of 30,000 to as few as 2,000 to 3,000. By the end of Selim III&#x27;s reign, however, they experienced a renewal, expanding to some 10,000 salaried Sipahis (not including provincial cavalry or irregular Deli horsemen). This was a considerable cavalry force, with many of the troopers being instructed by the French advisors to the Porte.

==== Artillery ====
The artillery was divided into the &quot;topçu ocağı&quot; (artillery corps) and the &quot;humbaracı ocağı&quot; (mortar corps), these 2 groups received the most attention from the reformers with French and Spanish assistance during the 1807 Anglo-Turkish war, where the Ottoman artillery assembled 322 cannons and mortars alongside thousands of troops to defend the coastline of the Sea of Marmara, necessitating a British withdrawal. The Topçu corps alone contained 30,000 men and the &quot;suratçı ocağı&quot; (rapid-fire gun corps) had 2,000 men. The artillery corps had 10 infantry assigned per gun and they jointly garrisoned the European side of the Boshporus.

=== Provincial forces ===

==== Asia ====
In Antatolia the majority of local musketeers were Kurdish and the governor of Trabzon organised his own army and proclaimed his independence. However the majority of the Ayans remained loyal including those in the Caucauss with the Kabartay princes and their 30,000 soldiers remaining loyal to the Sultan.

In Iraq, mamluks were used for local law and order whilst Arab troops occupied the forts around Baghdad and they proved adept in combat rebelling the Wahhabi raiders.

In Syria local government was more divided with many of the Pashas maintaining sizable personal armies ranging from 1,000 cavalry and 900 cavalry to 300 cavalry and 100 infantry. The troops were of an ethnic mix and some zamburaks were noted to be used in the Syrian armies.

=== Egypt ===
The Mamluks were the pre-eminent force in Egypt with their forces numbering 10,000 men in strength with 3,000 assistants with 8,500 mamluks in training in the 1780s. The Mamluks spent their entire time dedicated to training and fighting and jealously guarded their military privileges banning anyone from riding a horse in Egypt. The mamluks had by this period fully adopted firearms and trained with these and had abandoned horse archery.

There were also musketeers, janissaries, sipahis and other Ottoman units though these had long since degenerated and the Arabs and Mamluks provided the main forces in Egypt.

== Reforms of Selim III ==
When Selim III came to the throne in 1789, an ambitious effort of military reform was launched, geared towards securing the Ottoman Empire. The sultan and those who surrounded him were conservative and desired to preserve the status quo. Selim III in 1789 to 1807 set up the &quot;Nizam-i Cedid&quot; [new order] army to replace the inefficient and outmoded imperial army. The old system depended on Janissaries, who had largely lost their military effectiveness. Selim closely followed Western military forms. It would be expensive for a new army, so a new treasury [&#x27;Irad-i Cedid&#x27;] had to be established. The result was the Porte now had an efficient, European-trained army equipped with modern weapons. However it had fewer than 10,000 soldiers in an era when Western armies were ten to fifty times larger. Furthermore, the Sultan was upsetting the well-established traditional political powers. As a result it was rarely used, apart from its use against Napoléon Bonaparte&#x27;s expeditionary force at Gaza and Rosetta as well as quelling of the First Serbian Uprising at the battle of Deligrad. The new army was dissolved by reactionary elements with the overthrow of Selim in 1807, but it became the model of the new Ottoman Army created later in the 19th century.

=== Introduction of advisors ===

Western military advisors were imported as advisors but their abilities to enact change were limited. A parade of French officers were brought in, and none of them could do a great deal. One example of an advisor who achieved limited success was the François Baron de Tott, a French officer. He did succeed in having a new foundry built to make artillery. He also directed the construction of a new naval base. However it was almost impossible for him to divert soldiers from the regular army into the new units. The new ships and guns that made it into service were too few to have much of an influence on the Ottoman army and de Tott returned home. He was succeeded by a Scot known as Ingiliz Mustafa.

When they had requested French help, General Bonaparte was to be sent to Constantinople in 1795 to help organize Ottoman artillery. He did not go, for just days before he was to embark for the Near East he proved himself useful to the Directory by putting down a Parisian mob in the &quot;whiff of grapeshot&quot; and was kept in France.

== Reforms of Mahmud II ==

In 1808 Mustafa IV was replaced by Mahmud II with martial law of Alemdar Mustafa Pasha who restarted the reform efforts. His first task was to ally with the Janissaries in order to break the power of the provincial governors. He then turned on the Janissaries, massacring them in their barracks in Istanbul and the provincial capitals in 1826, which is known as the Auspicious Incident. The Sultan now set himself to replace the Janissaries by other regular troops. The Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829 did not give him time to organize a new army, and the Sultan was forced to fight with these young and undisciplined recruits. The war was brought to a close by the disastrous Treaty of Adrianople. While the reforms in question were mainly implemented to improve the military, the most notable development that arose out of these efforts was a series of schools teaching everything from math to medicine to train new officers.

== Reforms of Abdulmejid I ==
Sultan Abdulmejid I enjoyed several years of peace, which enabled him to form a powerful and well disciplined army that was established at the beginning of the year 1842.

The chain-of-command in the general staff of each army was composed of a commander-in-chief, two lieutenant-generals, three brigadiers of infantry, one of whom commands the reserve, two brigadiers of cavalry, and one brigadier of artillery. In each corps there were three regiments of infantry, two of cavalry, and one of artillery, with thirty-three guns. The total strength of these twelve regiments of active forces was 30,000 men, but it was diminished in time of peace by furlough to an effective strength of about 25,000 men in three of the six armies, as well as 15,000 troops in the other three, a consequence of the recruiting system being as yet incomplete in its application all over the Ottoman Empire. The whole establishment of this branch amounts, therefore, to 180,000 men, belonging to the active service, but its effective strength is at present 123,000.

The reserve of four of the six armies consisted of eleven regiments, six of which were infantry, four of cavalry, and one of artillery. The total combined force equalled 12,000 troops, while the other two armies have not met their reserve of soldiers who have served five years. In time of war, however, the reserve would form two corps of 25,000 men in each army; giving a total of 300,000. The two services, therefore, as they stood, formed an effective force of 135,000 men; and when their full strength shall have been filled up it will amount to 480,000.

Besides these six armies there were four detached corps. These corps raise the effective strength of the standing army to 365,000 men.

Deployment at the time consisted of the following:

*the Island of Crete was assigned three regiments of infantry and one of cavalry, in all 11,000 men;
*the Pashalik of Tripoli in Africa was assigned one regiment of infantry and one of cavalry, about 5,000 strong;
*the Pashalik of Tunis was assigned one regiment of infantry and one of cavalry, about 5,000 strong.

Aside from deployed troops, the Ottoman military also had the following units:

**the central artillery corps,
**a standing brigade of sappers and miners with engineer officers,
**the veteran artillery brigade,
**permanent artillery garrisons of the fortresses on
***The Hellespont,
***The Bosphorus,
***The Danube, in Serbia, on the Adriatic,
***The coast of Asia Minor, in the islands of the Archipelago,
***the southern shores of the Black Sea, constituting a combined force of approximately 9,000 troops.

Besides augmentation of 32,000 men by the submission of Bosnia and Northern Albania to the new system; and a further increase of 40,000 men, which Serbia had arranged to furnish, 18,000 men served in Egypt, which would act to reinforce the reserve of the fifth army.

The marines, sailors, and workmen, enrolled in brigades that amounted to 34,000 total men. The grand total of armed men at the disposal of Ottoman Empire at the time could be calculated at no less than 664,000 men. In addition, the Ottomans could call-up occasional levies, which were more easily and efficiently utilized in the Ottoman Empire than in any other country at the time. After years of peace and stability the modernized army was put to test in the Crimean War.

== Reforms of Abdul Hamid II ==

Abdul Hamid II attached utmost importance to the reorganization of the military. As early as 1880 he sought, and two years later secured, German assistance, which culminated in the appointment of Lt. Col. Kohler and, finally, Colmar Von der Goltz as military advisors.

The curriculum of Harbiye (War College) was specialized further to train staff officers in the European style. The school’s name was changed to Mekteb-i Fununu Harb (School of War Science). It was during his reign that the officers’ training was upgraded and regularized, starting with the mid-level military rt2diye and idadi schools and culminating in the Mekteb-i Harbiye (War College) or, for the most capable, in the Erkan-i Harbiye (Chiefs of Staff). The last, as a concept and an organization, was largely the work of von der Goltz.

However, although the consensus that Abdulhamid favoured the modernization of the Ottoman army and the professionalization of the officer corps was fairly general, it seems that he neglected the military during the last fifteen years of his reign, and he also cut down the military budget. The problem with the army (numbering Ca. 700,000 at the end of the century) The annual army expenditures were some 7,756,000 liras out of a total national budget of 18,927,000 liras for 1897; when the Debt Administration claimed 6,483.000 liras, little was left for investment in economic development.

<doc id="166321" wikidata="Q753880" url="?curid=166321" title="Jurchen people">
<text>Jurchen (, ; , ) is a term used to collectively describe a number of East Asian Tungusic-speaking people. They lived in northeastern China, also known as Manchuria, before the 18th century. The Jurchens were renamed Manchus in 1635 by Hong Taiji. Different Jurchen groups lived as hunter-gatherers, pastoralist semi-nomads, or sedentary agriculturists. Generally lacking a central authority, and having little communication with each other, many Jurchen groups fell under the influence of neighbouring dynasties, their chiefs paying tribute and holding nominal posts as effectively hereditary commanders of border guards.

Han officials of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) classified them into three groups, reflecting relative proximity to the Ming:

#Jianzhou (Chinese: 建州) Jurchens, some of whom were mixed with Chinese populations, lived in the proximity of the Mudan river, the Changbai mountains, and Liaodong. They were noted as able to sew clothes similar to the Chinese, and lived by hunting and fishing, sedentary agriculture, and trading in pearls and ginseng. 
#Haixi (Chinese: 海西) Jurchens, named after the Haixi or Songhua river, included several populous and independent tribes, largely divided between semi-nomadic pastoralists in the west and sedentary agriculturalists in the east. They were the Jurchens most strongly influenced by the Mongols.
#Yeren (Chinese: 野人, lit. &#x27;Wild People,&#x27; or, &#x27;savage,&#x27; &#x27;barbarian&#x27;), a term sometimes used by Chinese and Korean commentators to refer to all Jurchens. It more specifically referred to the inhabitants of the sparsely populated north of Manchuria beyond the Liao and Songhua river valleys, supporting themselves by hunting, fishing, pig farming, and some migratory agriculture. 
Many &quot;Yeren Jurchens&quot;, like the Nivkh (speaking a language isolate), Negidai, Nanai, Oroqen and many Evenks, are today considered distinct ethnic groups.

The Jurchens are chiefly known for producing the Jin (1115–1234) and Qing (1644–1912) conquest dynasties on the Chinese territory. The latter dynasty, originally calling itself the Later Jin, was founded by a Jianzhou commander, Nurhaci (r. 1616–26), who unified most Jurchen tribes, incorporated their entire population into hereditary military regiments known as the Eight Banners, and patronized the creation of an alphabet for their language based on the Mongolian script. The term Manchu, already in official use by the Later Jin at that time, was in 1635 decreed to be the sole acceptable name for that people.

==Name==
The name Jurchen is derived from a long line of other variations of the same name.

The initial Khitan form of the name was said to be &quot;Lüzhen&quot;. The variant &quot;Nrjo-tsyin&quot; (now Nüzhen, whence English Nurchen) appeared in the 10th century under the Liao dynasty. The Jurchens were also interchangeably known as the &quot;Nrjo-drik&quot; (now Nüzhi). This is traditionally explained as an effect of the Chinese naming taboo, with the character being removed after the 1031 enthronement of Zhigu, Emperor Xingzong of Liao, because it appeared in the sinified form of his personal name. Aisin-Gioro Ulhicun, however, argues that this was a later folk etymology and the original reason was uncertainty among dialects regarding the name&#x27;s final &quot;-n&quot; (Nussin, Naisin).

The form &quot;Niuche&quot; was introduced to the West by Martino Martini in his 1654 work &quot;De bello tartarico historia&quot;, and it soon appeared, e.g., on the 1660 world map by Nicolas Sanson.

&quot;Jurchen&quot; (Jyrkin) is an anglicization of Jurčen, an attempted reconstruction of this unattested original form of the native name, which has been transcribed into Middle Chinese as &quot;Trjuwk-li-tsyin&quot; () and into Khitan small script as &quot;Julisen&quot;(sulaisin). The ethnonyms &quot;Sushen&quot; and &quot;Jizhen&quot; (, recorded in geographical works like the &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot; and the &quot;Book of Wei&quot; are possibly cognates. It was the source of Fra Mauro&#x27;s &#x27; and Marco Polo&#x27;s &#x27;, reflecting the Persian form of their name. Vajda considers that the Jurchens&#x27; name probably derives from the Tungusic words for &quot;reindeer people&quot; and is cognate with the names of the Orochs (urakka, uroot, urhot) of Khabarovsk Province and the Oroks of Sakhalin. (&quot;Horse Tungus&quot; and &quot;Reindeer Tungus&quot; are still the primary divisions among the Tungusic cultures.)

Janhunen argues that these records already reflect the Classical Mongolian plural form of the name, recorded in the &quot;Secret History&quot; as &quot;J̌ürčät&quot; (Jyrkät), and further reconstructed as *&quot;Jörcid&quot;, The modern Mongolian form is &quot;Зүрчид&quot; (Zürčid, Suurseita)) whose medial does not appear in the later Jurchen &quot;Jucen&quot; or &quot;Jušen&quot; (Jussin)(Jurchen:) or Manchu &quot;Jushen&quot;(Jussin). In Manchu, this word was more often used to describe the serfs—though not slaves—of the free Manchu people, who were themselves mostly the former Jurchens. To describe the historical people who founded the Jin dynasty, they reborrowed the Mongolian name as &quot;Jurcit&quot;(Jyrkät).

In the dictionary of I. I. Zakharov “Complete Manchu-Russian dictionary” the word &quot;чжурчэнь&quot; (Jurchen’) is defined as &quot;resistance&quot;, &quot;disobedience&quot;, &quot;insubordination&quot; (сопротивление, непослушание, непокорность). 

==Appearance==

According to William of Rubruck, the Jurchens were &quot;swarthy like Spaniards.&quot;

Sin Chung-il, a Korean emissary who in 1595 had visited the Jurchen living north-west of the Yalu River, notes that during his visit to Fe Ala all those who served Nurhaci were uniform in their dress and hairstyle. They all shaved a portion of their scalp and kept the remaining hair in a long plaited braid. All men wore leather boots, breeches, and tunics.

==History==
===Origin===
====Mohe origin====
When the Jurchens first entered Chinese records in 748, they inhabited the forests and river valleys of the land which is now divided between China&#x27;s Heilongjiang Province and Russia&#x27;s Primorsky Krai province. In earlier records, this area was known as the home of the Sushen ( BC), the Yilou (around AD 200), the Wuji (), and the Mohe (). Scholarship since the Qing period traces the origin of the Jurchens to the &quot;Wanyen tribe of the Mohos&quot; around Mt Xiaobai, or to the Heishui or Blackwater Mohe, and some sources stress the continuity between these earlier peoples with the Jurchen but this remains conjectural.

The tentative ancestors of the Jurchens, the Tungusic Mohe tribes, were people of the multi-ethnic kingdom of Balhae. The Mohe enjoyed eating pork, practiced pig farming extensively, and were mainly sedentary. They used both pig and dog skins for coats. They were predominantly farmers and grew soybean, wheat, millet, and rice in addition to hunting. Like all Tungus people, the Mohe practiced slavery. Horses were rare in the region they inhabited until the 10th century under the domination of the Khitans. The Mohe rode reindeer.

====Wanyan origin====
There is no dated evidence of the Jurchens before the time of Wugunai (1021-74), when the Jurchens began to coalesce into a nation-like federation. According to tradition passed down via oral transmission, Wugunai was the 6th generation descendant of Hanpu, the founder of the Wanyan clan, who therefore must have lived around the year 900. Hanpu originally came from the Heishui Mohe tribe of Balhae. According to the &quot;History of Jin&quot;, when he came to the Wanyan tribe, it was for the repayment of a murder and a form of compensation. He had two brothers, one who stayed in Goryeo and the other in Balhae when he left. By the time he arrived and settled among the Wanyan, he was already 60 years old and accepted as a &quot;wise man&quot;. He succeeded in settling a dispute between two families without resorting to violence, and as a reward, was betrothed to a worthy unmarried maiden also 60 years old. The marriage was blessed with the gift of a dark ox, which was revered in Jurchen culture, and from this union came one daughter and three sons. With this, Hanpu became the chief of the Wanyan and his descendants became formal members of the Wanyan clan.

Because Hanpu arrived from Goryeo, some South Korean scholars have claimed that Hanpu hailed from Goryeo. According to Alexander Kim, this cannot be easily identified as him being Korean because many Balhae people lived in Goryeo at that time. Later when Aguda appealed to the Balhae people in the Liao dynasty for support by emphasizing their common origin, he only mentioned those who descended from the &quot;seven Wuji tribes&quot;, which the Goguryeo people were not a part of. It seems by that point, the Jurchens saw only the Mohe tribes as a related people. Some western scholars consider the origin of Hanpu to be legendary in nature. Herbert Franke described the narrative provided in the &quot;History of Jin&quot; as an &quot;ancestral legend&quot; with a historical basis in that the Wanyan clan had absorbed immigrants from Goryeo and Balhae during the 10th century. Frederick W. Mote described it as a &quot;tribal legend&quot; that may have born the tribe&#x27;s memories. The two brothers remaining in Goryeo and Balhae may represent ancestral ties to those two peoples while Hanpu&#x27;s marriage may represent the tribe&#x27;s transformation from a matrilineal to patrilineal society.

====Qing origin====
Hongtaiji, the Qing dynasty emperor of the Aisin Gioro clan, claimed that their progenitor, Bukūri Yongšon (布庫里雍順), was conceived from a virgin birth. According to the legend, three heavenly maidens, namely Enggulen (恩古倫), Jenggulen (正古倫) and Fekulen (佛庫倫), were bathing at a lake called Bulhūri Omo near the Changbai Mountains. A magpie dropped a piece of red fruit near Fekulen, who ate it. She then became pregnant with Bukūri Yongšon. However, another older version of the story by the Hurha (Hurka) tribe member Muksike recorded in 1635 contradicts Hongtaiji&#x27;s version on location, claiming that it was in Heilongjiang province close to the Amur river where Bulhuri lake was located where the &quot;heavenly maidens&quot; took their bath. This was recorded in the Jiu Manzhou Dang and is much shorter and simpler in addition to being older. This is believed to be the original version and Hongtaiji changed it to the Changbai mountains. It shows that the Aisin Gioro clan originated in the Amur area and the Heje (Hezhen) and other Amur valley Jurchen tribes had an oral version of the same tale. It also fits with Jurchen history since some ancestors of the Manchus originated north before the 14th-15th centuries in the Amur and only later moved south.

===Liao vassals===

By the 11th century, the Jurchens had become vassals of the Khitan rulers of the Liao dynasty. The Jurchens in the Yalu River region had been tributaries of Goryeo since the reign of Wang Geon, who called upon them during the wars of the Later Three Kingdoms period, but the Jurchens opportunistically switched allegiance between Liao and Goryeo multiple times. They offered tribute to both courts out of political necessity and the desire for material benefits.

In 1019, Jurchen pirates raided Japan for slaves. The Jurchen pirates slaughtered Japanese men while seizing Japanese women as prisoners. Fujiwara Notada, the Japanese governor was killed. In total, 1,280 Japanese were taken prisoner, 374 Japanese were killed and 380 Japanese owned livestock were killed for food. Only 259 or 270 were returned by Koreans from the eight ships. The woman Uchikura no Ishime&#x27;s report was copied down.

One of the causes of the Jurchen rebellion and the fall of the Liao was the custom of raping married Jurchen women and Jurchen girls by Khitan envoys, which caused resentment from the Jurchens. The custom of having sex with unmarried girls by Khitan was itself not a problem, since the practice of guest prostitution - giving female companions, food and shelter to guests - was common among Jurchens. Unmarried daughters of Jurchen families of lower and middle classes in Jurchen villages were provided to Khitan messengers for sex, as recorded by Hong Hao. Song envoys among the Jin were similarly entertained by singing girls in Guide, Henan. There is no evidence that guest prostitution of unmarried Jurchen girls to Khitan men was resented by the Jurchens. It was only when the Khitans forced aristocratic Jurchen families to give up their beautiful wives as guest prostitutes to Khitan messengers that the Jurchens became resentful. This suggests that in Jurchen upper classes, only a husband had the right to his married wife while among lower class Jurchens, the virginity of unmarried girls and sex with Khitan men did not impede their ability to marry later. The Jurchens and their Manchu descendants had Khitan linguistic and grammatical elements in their personal names like suffixes. Many Khitan names had a &quot;ju&quot; suffix.

===Goryeo-Jurchen war===
The Jurchens in the Yalu River region were tributaries of Goryeo since the reign of Taejo of Goryeo (r. 918-943), who called upon them during the wars of the Later Three Kingdoms period. Taejo relied heavily on a large Jurchen cavalry force to defeat Later Baekje. The Jurchens switched allegiances between Liao and Goryeo multiple times depending on which they deemed the most appropriate. The Liao and Goryeo competed to gain the allegiance of Jurchen settlers who effectively controlled much of the border area beyond Goryeo and Liao fortifications. These Jurchens offered tribute but expected to be rewarded richly by the Goryeo court in return. However the Jurchens who offered tribute were often the same ones who raided Goryeo&#x27;s borders. In one instance, the Goryeo court discovered that a Jurchen leader who had brought tribute had been behind the recent raids on their territory. The frontier was largely outside of direct control and lavish gifts were doled out as a means of controlling the Jurchens. Sometimes Jurchens submitted to Goryeo and were given citizenship. Goryeo inhabitants were forbidden from trading with Jurchens.

The tributary relations between Jurchens and Goryeo began to change under the reign of Jurchen leader Wuyashu (r. 1103–1113) of the Wanyan clan. The Wanyan clan was intimately aware of the Jurchens who had submitted to Goryeo and used their power to break the clans&#x27; allegiance to Goryeo, unifying the Jurchens. The resulting conflict between the two powers led to Goryeo&#x27;s withdrawal from Jurchen territory and acknowledgment of Jurchen control over the contested region.

As the geopolitical situation shifted, Goryeo unleashed a series of military campaigns in the early 12th century to regain control of its borderlands. Goryeo had already been in conflict with the Jurchens before. In 984, Goryeo failed to control the Yalu River basin due to conflict with the Jurchens. In 1056, Goryeo repelled the Eastern Jurchens and afterward destroyed their stronghold of over 20 villages. In 1080, Munjong of Goryeo led a force of 30,000 to conquer ten villages. However by the rise of the Wanyan clan, the quality of Goryeo&#x27;s army had degraded and it mostly consisted of infantry. There were several clashes with the Jurchens, usually resulting in Jurchen victory with their mounted cavalrymen. In 1104, the Wanyan Jurchens reached Chongju while pursuing tribes resisting them. Goryeo sent Lim Gan to confront the Jurchens, but his untrained army was defeated, and the Jurchens took Chongju castle. Lim Gan was dismissed from office and reinstated, dying as a civil servant in 1112. The war effort was taken up by Yun Kwan, but the situation was unfavorable and he returned after making peace.

Yun Kwan believed that the loss was due to their inferior cavalry and proposed to the king that an elite force known as the Byeolmuban (別武班; &quot;Special Warfare Army&quot;) be created. it existed apart from the main army and was made up of cavalry, infantry, and a &quot;Hangmagun&quot; (&quot;Subdue Demon Corps&quot;). In December 1107, Yun Kwan and O Yŏnch’on set out with 170,000 soldiers to conquer the Jurchens. The army won against the Jurchens and built Nine Fortresses over a wide area on the frontier encompassing Jurchen tribal lands, and erected a monument to mark the boundary. However due to unceasing Jurchen attacks, diplomatic appeals, and court intrigue, the Nine Fortresses were handed back to the Jurchens. In 1108, Yun Kwan was removed from office and the Nine Fortresses were turned over to the Wanyan clan. It is plausible that the Jurchens and Goryeo had some sort of implicit understanding where the Jurchens would cease their attacks while Goryeo took advantage of the conflict between the Jurchens and Khitans to gain territory. According to Breuker, Goryeo never really had control of the region occupied by the Nine Fortresses in the first place and maintaining hegemony would have meant a prolonged conflict with militarily superior Jurchen troops that would prove very costly. The Nine Fortresses were exchanged for Poju (Uiju), a region the Jurchens later contested when Goryeo hesitated to recognize them as their suzerain.

Later, Wuyashu&#x27;s younger brother Aguda founded the Jin dynasty (1115–1234). When the Jin was founded, the Jurchens called Goryeo their &quot;parent country&quot; or &quot;father and mother&quot; country. This was because it had traditionally been part of their system of tributary relations, its rhetoric, advanced culture, as well as the idea that it was &quot;bastard offspring of Koryŏ&quot;. The Jin also believed that they shared a common ancestry with the Balhae people in the Liao dynasty. The Jin went on to conquer the Liao dynasty in 1125 and capture the Song capital of Kaifeng in 1127 (Jingkang incident). The Jin also put pressure on Goryeo and demanded that Goryeo become their subject. While many in Goryeo were against this, Yi Cha-gyöm was in power at the time and judged peaceful relations with the Jin to be beneficial to his own political power. He accepted the Jin demands and in 1126, the king of Goryeo declared himself a Jin vassal (tributary). However the Goryeo king retained his position as &quot;Son of Heaven&quot; within Goryeo. By incorporating Jurchen history into that of Goryeo and emphasizing the Jin emperors as bastard offspring of Goryeo, and placing the Jin within the template of a &quot;northern dynasty&quot;, the imposition of Jin suzerainty became more acceptable.

=== Jin dynasty ===

Wanyan Aguda, chief of the Wanyan tribe, unified the various Jurchen tribes in 1115 and declared himself emperor. In 1120 he seized Shangjing, also known as Linhuang Prefecture (), the northern capital of the Liao dynasty. During the Jin–Song Wars, the Jurchens invaded the Northern Song dynasty and overran most of northern China. The Jurchens initially created the puppet regimes of Da Qi and Da Chu but later adopted a dynastic name and became known as &quot;Jin&quot; 金, which means &quot;gold&quot;, not to be confused with the earlier Jin 晋 dynasties named after the region around Shanxi and Henan provinces. The name of the Jurchen dynasty in Chinese — meaning &quot;gold&quot;—is derived from the &quot;Gold River&quot; (Jurchen: &quot;antʃu-un&quot;; Manchu: &quot;Aisin&quot;) in their ancestral homeland. The Jurchens who settled into urban communities eventually intermarried with other ethnicities in China. The Jin rulers themselves came to follow Confucian norms. The Jin dynasty captured the Northern Song dynasty&#x27;s capital, Bianjing, in 1127. Their armies pushed the Song all the way south to the Yangtze River and eventually settled on a border with the Southern Song dynasty along the Huai River.

Poor Jurchen families in the southern Routes (Daming and Shandong) Battalion and Company households tried to live the lifestyle of wealthy Jurchen families and avoid doing farming work by selling their own Jurchen daughters into slavery and renting their land to Han tenants. The Wealthy Jurchens feasted and drank and wore damask and silk. The History of Jin (Jinshi) says that Emperor Shizong of Jin took note and attempted to halt these things in 1181.

After 1189, the Jin dynasty became increasingly involved in conflicts with the Mongols. By 1215, after losing much territory to the Mongols, the Jurchens moved their capital south from Zhongdu to Kaifeng. The Jin emperor Wanyan Yongji&#x27;s daughter, Jurchen Princess Qiguo was married to Mongol leader Genghis Khan in exchange for relieving the Mongol siege upon Zhongdu. After a siege lasting about a year, Kaifeng fell to the Mongols in 1233. Emperor Aizong fled to Caizhou for shelter, but Caizhou also fell to the Mongols in 1234, marking the end of the Jin dynasty.

=== Ming dynasty ===


Chinese chroniclers of the Ming dynasty distinguished three different groups of Jurchens: the Wild Jurchens () of what became Outer Manchuria, the Haixi Jurchens () of modern Heilongjiang Province and the Jianzhou Jurchens of modern Jilin Province. They led a pastoral-agrarian lifestyle, hunting, fishing, and engaging in limited agriculture. In 1388, the Hongwu Emperor dispatched a mission to establish contact with the Odoli, Huligai and T&#x27;owen tribes.

The issue of controlling the Jurchens was a point of contention between Joseon Korea and the early Ming.

The Yongle Emperor (r. 1402–1424) found allies among the various Jurchen tribes against the Mongols. He bestowed titles and surnames to various Jurchen chiefs and expected them to send periodic tribute. One of the Yongle Emperor&#x27;s consorts was a Jurchen princess, which resulted in some of the eunuchs serving him being of Jurchen origin.

Chinese commanderies were established over tribal military units under their own hereditary tribal leaders. In the Yongle period, 178 commanderies were set up in Manchuria. Later on, horse markets were established in the northern border towns of Liaodong. Increased contact with the Chinese gave Jurchens the more complex and sophisticated organizational structures.

The Koreans dealt with the Jurchen military through appeals to material benefits and launching punitive expeditions. To appease them the Joseon court handed out titles and degrees, trading with them, and sought to acculturate them by having Korean women marry Jurchens and integrating them into Korean culture. These measures were unsuccessful and fighting continued between the Jurchen and the Koreans. This relationship between the Jurchens and Koreans was ended by the Ming which envisioned the Jurchens as a form of protective border to the north. In 1403, Ahacu, chieftain of Huligai, paid tribute to the Yongle Emperor. Soon after, Mentemu, chieftain of Odoli clan of the Jianzhou Jurchens, defected from paying tribute to Korea, becoming a tributary to China instead. Yi Seong-gye, the first ruler of Joseon, asked the Ming dynasty to send Mentemu back but was refused. The Yongle Emperor was determined to wrest the Jurchens out of Korean influence and have China dominate them instead. The Koreans tried to persuade Mentemu to reject the Ming dynasty&#x27;s overtures but were unsuccessful. The Jurchen tribes presented tribute to the Ming dynasty in succession. They were divided in 384 guards by the Ming dynasty and the Jurchen became vassals to the Ming emperors. The name given to the Jurchen land by the Ming dynasty was Nurgan. Later, a Korean army led by Yi-Il and Yi Sun-sin would expel them from Korea.

In 1409, the Ming government created the Nurgan Command Post () at Telin (present-day Tyr, Russia, about 100 km upstream from Nikolayevsk-on-Amur in the Russian Far East) in the vicinity of Heilongjiang. The Jurchens came under the nominal administration of the Nurgan Command Post which lasted only 25 years and was abolished in 1434. Leaders of the Haixi and Jianzhou tribes did, however, accept the Ming titles.

From 1411 to 1433, the Ming eunuch Yishiha (who himself was a Haixi Jurchen) led ten large missions to win over the allegiance of the Jurchen tribes along the Songhua River and Amur River. His fleet sailed down the Songhua into the Amur, and set up the Nurgan Command at Telin near the mouth of the Amur River. These missions are not well recorded in the Ming histories, but there exist two stone steles erected by Yishiha at the site of the Yongning Temple, a Guanyin temple commissioned by him at Telin. The inscriptions on the steles are in four languages: Chinese, Jurchen, Mongol, and Tibetan. There is probably quite a lot of propaganda in the inscriptions, but they give a detailed record of the Ming court&#x27;s efforts to assert suzerainty over the Jurchen. When Yishiha visited Nurgan for the 3rd time in 1413, he built a temple called Yongning Temple at Telin and erected the Yongning Temple Stele in front of it. Yishiha paid his 10th visit to Nurgan in 1432, during which he rebuilt the Yongning Temple and re-erected a stele in front of it. The stele bore the heading &quot;Record of Re-building Yongning Temple&quot;. The setting up of the Nurgan Command Post and the repeated declarations to offer blessings to this region by Yishiha and others were all recorded in this and the first steles.

In the ninth year of the Ming Xuande emperor the Jurchens in Manchuria under Ming rule suffered from famine forcing them to sell their daughters into slavery and moving to Liaodong to beg for help and relief from the Ming dynasty government.

===Establishment of the Manchu===
Over a period of 30 years from 1586, Nurhaci, a chieftain of the Jianzhou Jurchens, united the Jurchen tribes. In 1635, his son and successor, Hong Taiji, renamed his people the Manchus as a clear break from their past as Chinese vassals. During the Ming dynasty, the Koreans of Joseon referred to the Jurchen-inhabited lands north of the Korean peninsula, above the rivers Yalu and Tumen as part of the &quot;superior country&quot; (sangguk) which they called Ming China. The Qing deliberately excluded references and information that showed the Jurchens (Manchus) as subservient to the Ming dynasty, when composing the History of Ming to hide their former subservient relationship. The Veritable Records of Ming were not used to source content on Jurchens during Ming rule in the History of Ming because of this. The Yongzheng Emperor attempted to rewrite the historical record and claim that the Aisin Gioro were never subjects of past dynasties and empires trying to cast Nurhaci&#x27;s acceptance of Ming titles like Dragon Tiger General (longhu jiangjun 龍虎將軍) by claiming he accepted to &quot;please Heaven&quot;.

During the Qing dynasty, the two original editions of the books of the &quot;&quot;Qing Taizu Wu Huangdi Shilu&quot; and the &quot;Manzhou Shilu Tu&quot;&quot; (Taizu Shilu Tu) were kept in the palace, forbidden from public view because they showed that the Manchu Aisin Gioro family had been ruled by the Ming dynasty.

== Culture ==

Jurchen culture shared many similarities with the hunter-gatherer lifestyle of Siberian-Manchurian tundra and coastal peoples. Like the Khitan people and Mongols, they took pride in feats of strength, horsemanship, archery, and hunting. Both Mongols and Jurchens used the title &quot;Khan&quot; for the leaders of a political entity, whether &quot;emperor&quot; or &quot;chief&quot;. A particularly powerful chief was called &quot;beile&quot; (&quot;prince, nobleman&quot;), corresponding with the Mongolian &quot;beki&quot; and Turkic &quot;baig&quot; or &quot;bey&quot;. Also like the Mongols and the Turks, the Jurchens did not observe primogeniture. According to tradition, any capable son or nephew could be chosen to become leader.

Unlike the Mongols, the Jurchens were a sedentary and agrarian society. They farmed grain and millet as their primary cereal crops, grew flax and raised oxen, pigs, sheep, and horses. &quot;At the most&quot;, the Jurchen could only be described as &quot;semi-nomadic&quot; while the majority of them were sedentary.

Jurchen similarities and differences with the Mongols were emphasized to various degrees by Nurhaci out of political expediency. Nurhaci once said to the Mongols that &quot;the languages of the Chinese and Koreans are different, but their clothing and way of life is the same. It is the same with us Manchus (&quot;Jušen&quot;) and Mongols. Our languages are different, but our clothing and way of life is the same.&quot; Later, Nurhaci indicated that the bond with the Mongols was not based on any real shared culture, but rather on pragmatic reasons of &quot;mutual opportunism&quot;. He said to the Mongols, &quot;You Mongols raise livestock, eat meat and wear pelts. My people till the fields and live on grain. We two are not one country and we have different languages&quot;.

During the Ming dynasty, the Jurchens lived in sub-clans (&quot;mukun&quot; or &quot;hala mukun&quot;) of ancient clans (&quot;hala&quot;). Not all clan members were blood related, and division and integration of different clans was common. Jurchen households (&quot;boo&quot;) lived as families (&quot;booigon&quot;) consisting of five to seven blood-related family members and a number of slaves. Households formed squads (&quot;tatan&quot;) to engage in tasks related to hunting and food gathering and formed companies (&quot;niru&quot;) for larger activities, such as war.

===Haixi, Jianzhou, Yeren===
The Haixi Jurchens were &quot;semi-agricultural, the Jianzhou Jurchens and Maolian () Jurchens were sedentary, while hunting and fishing was the way of life of the &quot;Wild Jurchens&quot;. Hunting, horseback archery, horsemanship, livestock raising, and sedentary agriculture were all practiced by Jianzhou Jurchens. The Jurchen way of life (economy) was described as agricultural. They farmed crops and raised animals. Jurchens practiced slash-and-burn agriculture in the areas north of Shenyang.

===Queue===
In 1126, the Jurchens initially ordered male Han Chinese within their conquered territories to adopt the Jurchen hairstyle by shaving the front of their heads and adopting Jurchen dress, but the order was later lifted. Jurchens were impersonated by Han rebels who wore their hair in the Jurchen queue to strike fear within their population. During the Qing dynasty, the Manchus, who descended from the Jurchens, similarly made Han Chinese men shave the front of their head and wear the rest of their hair in a queue, or &quot;soncoho&quot; () (), the traditional Manchu hairstyle.

===Dogs===
Although their Mohe ancestors did not revere dogs, the Jurchens began to revere dogs around the time of the Ming dynasty and passed this tradition on to the Manchus. It was prohibited in Jurchen culture to use dog skin, and forbidden for Jurchens to harm, kill, or eat dogs. The Jurchens believed that the &quot;utmost evil&quot; was the usage of dog skin by Koreans.

===Sex and marriage===
Pre-marital sex was probably accepted in lower class Jurchen society since the practice of guest prostitution - providing visitors with sex - did not impede their ability to marry later. The Jurchens also allowed marriage with in-laws, a practice considered taboo in Chinese society. Abduction marriages were common.

===Burial===
Until recently, it was uncertain what kind of burial rites existed among the Jurchens. In July 2012, Russian archaeologists discovered a Jurchen burial ground in Partizansky District of Primorye in Russia. Fifteen graves dating to the 12th or 13th century were found, consisting of the grave of a chieftain placed in the centre, with the graves of 14 servants nearby. All the graves contained pots with ashes, prompting the scientists to conclude that the Jurchens cremated the corpses of their dead. The grave of the chieftain also contained a quiver with arrows and a bent sword. The archaeologists propose that the sword was purposely bent, to signify that the owner would no longer need it in earthly life. The researchers planned to return to Primorye to establish whether this was a singular burial or a part of the larger burial ground.

===Agriculture===
Only the Mongols and the northern &quot;wild&quot; Jurchen were semi-nomadic, unlike the mainstream Jianzhou Jurchens descended from the Jin dynasty, who were farmers that foraged, hunted, herded and harvested crops in the Liao and Yalu river basins. They gathered ginseng root, pine nuts, hunted for came pels in the uplands and forests, raised horses in their stables, and farmed millet and wheat in their fallow fields. They engaged in dances, wrestling and drinking strong liquor as noted during midwinter by the Korean Sin Chung-il when it was very cold. These Jurchens who lived in the northeast&#x27;s harsh cold climate sometimes half sunk their houses in the ground which they constructed of brick or timber and surrounded their fortified villages with stone foundations on which they built wattle and mud walls to defend against attack. Village clusters were ruled by beile, hereditary leaders. They fought each other and dispensed weapons, wives, slaves and lands to their followers in them. This was how the Jurchens who founded the Qing lived and how their ancestors lived before the Jin. Alongside Mongols and Jurchen clans there were migrants from Liaodong provinces of Ming China and Korea living among these Jurchens in a cosmopolitan manner. Nurhaci, who was hosting Sin Chung-il, was uniting all of them into his own army, having them adopt the Jurchen hairstyle of a long queue and a shaved forecrown and wearing leather tunics. His armies had black, blue, red, white and yellow flags. These became the Eight Banners, initially capped to 4 then growing to 8 with three different types of ethnic banners as Han, Mongol and Jurchen were recruited into Nurhaci&#x27;s forces. Jurchens like Nurhaci spoke both their native Tungusic language and Chinese, adopting the Mongolian script for their own language, unlike the Jin Jurchen&#x27;s use of the Khitan large script. They adopted Confucian values and practiced shamanist traditions. Most Jurchens raised pigs and stock animals and were farmers.

The Qing stationed the &quot;New Manchu&quot; Warka foragers in Ningguta and attempted to turn them into normal agricultural farmers but then the Warka just reverted to hunter gathering and requested money to buy cattle for beef broth. The Qing wanted the Warka to become soldier-farmers and imposed this on them, but the Warka simply left their garrison at Ningguta and went back to the Sungari to their homes to herd, fish and hunt. The Qing accused them of desertion.

==Religion==
Jurchens practiced shamanic rituals and believed in a supreme sky goddess (&quot;abka hehe&quot;, literally sky woman). The Jurchens of the Jin dynasty practiced Buddhism, which became the prevalent religion of the Jurchens, and Daoism. The Jurchen word for &quot;sorceress&quot; was &quot;shanman&quot;. Under Confucian influence during the Qing dynasty the gender of the female sky deity was switched to a male sky father, Abka Enduri (&quot;abka-i enduri&quot;, &quot;abka-i han&quot;).

==Language==
The early Jurchen script was invented in 1120 by Wanyan Xiyin, acting on the orders of Wanyan Aguda. It was based on the Khitan script that was inspired in turn by Chinese characters. The written Jurchen language died out soon after the fall of the Jin dynasty. The Translators&#x27; Bureau of the Ming tributary bureaucracy received a communication from the Jurchens in 1444 stating that nobody among them understood the Jurchen script, so all letters sent to them should be written in Mongolian.

Until the end of the 16th century, when Manchu became the new literary language, the Jurchens used a combination of Mongolian and Chinese. The pioneering work on studies of the Jurchen script was done by Wilhelm Grube at the end of the 19th century.

==Genetics==
Haplogroup C3b2b1*-M401(xF5483) has been identified as a possible marker of the Aisin Gioro and is found in ten different ethnic minorities in northern China, but completely absent from Han Chinese.

Genetic testing also showed that the haplogroup C3b1a3a2-F8951 of the Aisin Gioro family came to southeastern Manchuria after migrating from their place of origin in the Amur river&#x27;s middle reaches, originating from ancestors related to Daurs in the Transbaikal area. The Tungusic speaking peoples mostly have C3c-M48 as their subclade of C3 which drastically differs from the C3b1a3a2-F8951 haplogroup of the Aisin Gioro which originates from Mongolic speaking populations like the Daur. Jurchen (Manchus) are a Tungusic people. The Mongol Genghis Khan&#x27;s haplogroup C3b1a3a1-F3796 (C3*-Star Cluster) is a fraternal &quot;brother&quot; branch of C3b1a3a2-F8951 haplogroup of the Aisin Gioro. A genetic test was conducted on 7 men who claimed Aisin Gioro descent with 3 of them showing documented genealogical information of all their ancestors up to Nurhaci. 3 of them turned out to share the C3b2b1*-M401(xF5483) haplogroup, out of them, 2 of them were the ones who provided their documented family trees. The other 4 tested were unrelated. The Daur Ao clan carries the unique haplogroup subclade C2b1a3a2-F8951, the same haplogroup as Aisin Gioro and both Ao and Aisin Gioro only diverged merely a couple of centuries ago from a shared common ancestor. Other members of the Ao clan carry haplogroups like N1c-M178, C2a1b-F845, C2b1a3a1-F3796 and C2b1a2-M48. People from northeast China, the Daur Ao clan and Aisin Gioro clan are the main carriers of haplogroup C2b1a3a2-F8951. The Mongolic C2*-Star Cluster (C2b1a3a1-F3796) haplogroup is a fraternal branch to Aisin Gioro&#x27;s C2b1a3a2-F8951 haplogroup.

==In fiction==

In the Alternative History timeline of Harry Turtledove&#x27;s novel &quot;Agent of Byzantium&quot;, the Jurchens migrate westwards, reach Europe and become a serious threat to the Byzantine Empire.

<doc id="166323" wikidata="Q5869870" url="?curid=166323" title="History of the Khitans">
<text>The history of the [[Khitan people|Khitans]] dates back to the 4th century. The Khitan people dominated much of northern China, Manchuria and the Mongolian Plateau. They subsequently established the Liao dynasty and the Western Liao dynasty.
Originally from Xianbei origins, the Khitans were part of the Kumo Xi tribe until 388 when the Kumo Xi–Khitan tribal grouping was defeated by the newly established Northern Wei dynasty. This allowed the Khitans to reorganize and consolidate their own tribal identity which led to the beginning of Khitan written history.
From the 5th to the 8th centuries, the Khitans were dominated by the Turks and then the Uyghurs in the west, various Central Plain dynasties in the south, and Goguryeo in the east. Despite coming under the domination of other polities, the Khitans grew in power. Their rise was slow compared to others because they were frequently crushed by neighbouring powers—each employing the Khitan warriors when needed but ready to crush them when the Khitans became too powerful.
Following the collapse of the Tang dynasty in the early 10th century, they founded the Liao dynasty in 916. The Liao dynasty proved to be a significant power north of the Central Plain and it gradually expanded to occupy other territories including the Sixteen Prefectures. They eventually fell to the Jin dynasty in 1125, who subordinated and absorbed the Khitans to their military benefit.
Following the fall of the Liao dynasty, many Khitans migrated westward and established the Western Liao dynasty. Although the Khitans no longer survive as a distinct ethnic group in contemporary times, their name is preserved in the Russian word for China (Китай, &quot;Kitay&quot;) as well as the archaic English (Cathay) Portuguese (&quot;Catai&quot;) Hungarian (&quot;Kína&quot;) and the Spanish (&quot;Catay&quot;) appellations of the name. 

==Origins==
References to the Khitan people in Chinese sources date back to the 4th century. After their regime was conquered by the Murong clan the remnants scattered in the modern-day Inner Mongolia and mixed there with the original Mongolic population.

== Pre-dynastic Khitans (388–916) ==

During the time of the Chinese Tang dynasty, the Khitan people were vassals to the suzerain Tang or Turks, depending on the balance of power between the two, or the suzerain Uyghurs when they replaced the Turks as the main steppe power. Once the Uyghurs left their home in the Mongolian Plateau in 842 enough of a power vacuum was left to give the Khitan the opportunity to cast off the bonds of subordinacy. The Khitan occupied the areas vacated by the Uyghurs bringing them under their control.
=== Khitan military activities from 388 to 618 ===
In the 5th century, the Khitan were under the Toba Wei influence.

In the 6th century, the Khitan tribes were still a weak confederation after being heavily defeated in 553 by the Northern Qi who enslaved many Khitans and seized a large part of their livestock, leading to harsh times for the Khitans. By that time the Khitan are still described as the lower level of nomadic civilization, their &#x27;confederation&#x27; still being an anarchist system of isolated tribes, each tending his own sheep and horses and hunting on his private territory. Some federal leaders were created after elections during a time of war after which it became a local power.

When the Sui dynasty was established in 581 when the Khitan were living in a period of internal military turmoil. Their tribes were fighting each other perhaps as a result of Sui Wendi strategy to increase tensions between nomads in order to create internal divisions. In 586 some Khitans tribes submitted to the Eastern Tujue (Turks) while others submitted to the Sui.

Notable Khitan raids on the Chinese Empire were record as early as the 7th century. In 605 they staged a large-scale raid southward invading Sui territories (Northern modern Shanxi, Hebei). They were eventually crushed by a Sui general leading 20,000 Turkish cavalry.

=== Military activities during the first half of the Tang dynasty (618–735) ===
====The Li-Sun Rebellion (696–697)====

Under Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 626–649) the Khitans became vassals of Tang dynasty. Despite some occasional clashes, the Khitans remained Chinese vassals until the 690s when Empress Wu took the throne of China. According to the &quot;Loose rein policy&quot;, the Khitan area was under Tang&#x27;s control by Zhao Wenhui, the governor-general of Yingzhou. Zhao was assisted by two local Khitan chieftains: Li Jinzhong, the governor (Dudu) of Songmo protectorate, and Duke of Yongle County, Sun Wanrong, who was the brother-in-law of Li Jinzhong.

Opposition rose because of the behaviour of Zhao Wenhui, who treated Khitan chieftains as his servants and refused to provide help during a famine that struck the Khitan area in 696. According to the &quot;loose rein policy&quot; the Tang governor-general was supposed to provide famine relief. When Zhao Wenhui failed to do so, Li and Sun launched a Khitan rebellion in the fifth month of 696.

Li Jinzhong declared himself &quot;Wushang Kehan&quot; (無上可汗: &quot;paramount khaghan&quot;) and killed Zhao Wenhui after capturing Yingzhou. Sun Wanrong assisted him as general who successfully led tens of thousands of troops marching southward and conquered several other towns of Tang dynasty.

The first significant Chinese response was to send an army led by twenty-eight generals, but they were defeated by Khitans in the Battle of Xiashi Gorge (near modern Lulong County of Hebei Province) in the eighth month of 696. Empress Wu was astonished by the announcement of the defeat and she quickly issued decrees to launch a new attack to the rebels. Khitans kept winning on the battlefields until Li Jinzhong died of disease. The rising power of the Khitans also threatened the newly established Second Turkic Khaganate, and the khagan Qapaghan Qaghan (Ashina Mochuo), who had supported the Khitan rebellion, switched to Empress Wu&#x27;s side after the Chinese gave him several promises including an imperial marriage for his daughter, adoption as the son of Empress Wu, the relocating of his people to (Hexi Corridor) and the restoration of Turkish overlordship of the Khitans.

The second major counter-attack from Empress Wu to the Khitans came in October 696, taking advantage of the recent death of Li Jingzhong. This time, Tang forces planned to attack Khitan from the south and the Turks would also invade Khitan from north. The Khitans suffered heavy losses in this campaign, but Sun Wanrong managed to stand still and motivated the Khitan troops. The rebellion of Khitans continued and Sun Wanrong&#x27;s men stormed into Jizhou and Yingzhou, shaking the whole region of Hebei. Empress Wu sent one of his best generals, Wang Xiaojie, assisted by Su Honghui and some other top warriors, with a third army of 170,000 men, to put down the rebellion. Due to the unfamiliarity to the local geography and terrains, Wang Xiaojie&#x27;s force was ambushed by Sun Wanrong at the Dongxia Rocky Valley (东峡石谷). Wang Xiaojie was killed while Su Honghui fled away. After that, Khitans captured Youzhou (near today&#x27;s Beijing), which was an important gateway to the northern plain of China.

In a fourth campaign during May 697, Empress Wu sent Lou Shide and Shatuo Zhongyi with 200,000 troops to stop Sun Wanrong&#x27;s from going further south. Khitans tried to ask for reinforcement from Turks. However, Turks refused the proposed Khitan-Turk alliance. Instead, they somehow allied with Empress Wu and launched a massive attack on Khitans. Meanwhile, Kumo Xi, another minority group who initially allied with Khitan in this rebellion, switched to Tang. Khitans had to face devastating Turkish raids from the north while a 200,000-men Chinese and Xi allied force attacking from the south. In this critical situation, Sun Wanrong was assassinated by one of his own subordinates, and the Khitan force collapsed. After this rebellion, Khitans began a new allegiance with the Turks as Qapaghan and the Empress Wu had planned early in 696. Empress Wu also appointed a new Khitan chieftain, whose name was Li Shihuo (697–717, [李]失活).

Consequently, Turks broke away with Empress Wu (who handed the crown back to the royal clan of Tang in 705). Tang launched several campaigns against them from 700 to 714 and eventually the khanate of Turks was overthrown by Uighurs who was supported by Tang dynasty.

====The Li-Sun rebellion and the Turks====
The Turks played a major role in crushing a rebellion in military actions and in a strategic role as well. The Turks were to submit to China in 630 after their first Turkish Empire was crushed. In 679 during a period of Chinese internal political turmoil they revolted. They were defeated by Tang troops in 681 in a Pyrrhic victory, also, the remaining Eastern Turks reunited under Ilterish Qaghan (Ashina Gutulu) (died 691) who was able to proclaim the rebirth of the Turkish empire without Tang&#x27;s reaction.

When Li-Sun died, his brother-in-law Sun Wanrong replaced him and engaged the Turks in an aggressive policy of &quot;plunder to strengthen&quot; as the best way to revitalize his Empire. The Turks plundered all their neighbour, the Khitan and Chinese included, but encouraged the Khitans to rebel against Tang rule. Almost as soon as the Khitan rebelled and were successful the Turks proposed an alliance with China. The Turks, engaged in a war against China, were just asking the Khitans for a diversion in the east allowing them to be more free on their front. When the Khitans unexpectedly appeared to be successful they both were surprised and afraid at seeing a new power born on their East. Seeing the Khitans fighting hard against the Chinese seemed the perfect occasion to take advantage of both the busy Khitan and the downtrodden Tang. By attacking Khitan on their rear the Turks provided an inestimable help to Tang which also worked for themselves by crushing that eastern rising power.

While the fourth Chinese campaign was still not launched, and despite previous propositions of alliance, the Turks attacked the Chinese territories to show clearly they were strong in the third month of 697. Along with the final victory they freed some Turkish prisoners held in six Chinese northern border prefectures since 670–674, gained the submission of both the Khitan and the Xi, plundered a large amount of seed-grain, silk, farming implements and iron as well as winning noble titles for Qapaghan and the asked for imperial marriage with Wu Zetian.

====The Ketuyu rebellion (720–734)====
In the 710s the Khitan military chief Ketuyu (可突于) was so valiant and beloved by Khitan&#x27;s commoners that the Khitan King Suogu (李娑固 Li Suogu, r. 718–720) became both jealous of him and in fear of a take-over. Accordingly, he plotted to assassinate Ketuyu. As is often the case the plot was disclosed and Ketuyu&#x27;s troops attacked the King who fled to Yingzhou to get Chinese support.

Xu Qinzhan (許欽?), the Chinese governor-general of Yingzhou, immediately called for a punitive military campaign ordering General Xue Tai assisted by 500 valiant soldier, Xi troops, and Suogu troops to go northwards. The Chinese-loyalist army was crushed and both Suogu (Khitan King) and Li Dapu (Xi King) were killed while Xue Tai was captured by Ketuyu. In hope of resuming good relations with the Chinese Tai was not executed and an envoy was sent to humbly apologize while Ketuyu enthroned Suogu&#x27;s cousin Yuyu (李鬱于, 720–722/724).

Peaceful relations were restored and when Ketuyu made a second coup to face the new king Tuyu suspicions, the Tang court peacefully confirmed the newly enthroned king Shaogu (李邵固 Li Shaogu, 725–730) who on his side displayed respect for Tang&#x27;s wishes of appeasement.

In 730 Ketuyu went to present tributes to Chang&#x27;an but was mistreated by chancellor Li Yuanhong. Back in the Khitan territories Ketuyu assassinated the pro-Tang Shaogu in the fifth month of 730 and switched the allegiance of his subjects, and of the Xi tribes, from Tang to the Türks sending a clear message to Tang. Ketuyu then attacked Pinglu (part of Yingzhou) where a defensive army of Tang&#x27;s was stationed. The Chang&#x27;an officials were panicked by the vision of a new Khitan rebellion and ordered Prince of Zhong Jun, as commander in chief assisted by 18 generals, to go north with warriors recruited from as far as Guannei, Hedong, Henan and Hebei to crush this Khitan-Xi rebellion. 

In the third month of 732 the Khitan-Xi troops were defeated by the Prince of Xin&#x27;an and Ketuyu had to flee while Li Shisuogao(李詩瑣高), the Xi king, betrayed him submitting to Tang with his 5,000 subjects getting the titles of the Prince of Guiyi (allegiance and righteousness) and prefect of Guiyi Zhou with the Xi allowed to settle in Youzhou under Chinese protection.

A second major campaign came in the fourth month of 733 when Guo Yingjie was ordered to lead 10,000 troops, assisted by Xi warriors, to crush Khitan. Ketuyu came first with Turkish support putting the Chinese-Xi troops in difficulty forcing the Xi to flee to save themselves. Predictably Guo Yingjie and his men, left alone to face the Khitan-Turkish troops, lost with heavy casualties. Guo and most of his men were killed on the battlefield. One year later the Khitan were defeated by Zhang Shougui, regional commander of Youzhou in the second month of 734.

Ketuyu, seeing the Khitan forces exhausted by repetitive Tang campaigns, pretended to surrender in the twelfth month of 734 and was murdered, together with his puppet King Yaonian Qulie (遙輦屈列, 730–734), by his subordinate Li Guozhe (李過折). Li Guozhe was soon himself assassinated in favor of a Ketuyu clan restoration.

====Origins of the Ketuyu Rebellion====
While traditional scholars explain this Ketuyu Rebellion as a typically barbarian reaction modern historians are more cautious. Both the Chinese Liao expert Shu Fen and the Japanese Matsui Hitoshi are inclined to think that Chinese lenient policy encouraged Ketuyu&#x27;s arrogance.
In contrast, Xu Elian-Qian supports the theory that Chinese interferences in Khitan internal changes caused the aggression to Ketuyu&#x27;s reactions. That may be true for the conflict of 720 and the aggressive Chinese behaviour. But this opinion does not explain the Chinese appeasement policy in 725 where the Chinese let Ketuyu kill the Khitan king and enthrone a new one. When Ketuyu was personally mistreated, in Chang&#x27;an in 730, this resentment led him to choose the larger of consequence of diplomatic opposition by turning his submission to the Turks. This was predictably understood by Chang&#x27;an as a first magnitude treason which could not be tolerated and lead to the ensuing five years of war to recapture them. Shu and Matsui do not see this Chinese reaction as an aggressive interference but rather as a predictable interference caused by Ketuyu&#x27;s arrogant reaction to the recent lenient policy.

Xu explains that the Khitans were at a turning point. The Dahe family collapsing as an after-shock of the Li-Sun Rebellion while the Yaonian family was growing by organizing a new confederation of alliances. Accordingly, this period was rich in turmoil. The opposition may have come from the respective perceived definition of the Loose rein agreement. In times of weakness in the central power, such as in the 680&#x27;s, this loose rein policy meant largely independence for the subordinate population who chose their own chief etc. In times of strong central power, as under Tang Xuanzong (r. 712–756), the central Chinese power was inclined to impose pro-Chinese choices, including in choice of Kings and major chiefs, despite the previous loose rein agreement. Also in prosperous times such as Xuanzong&#x27;s reign, and his courage in facing the 720&#x27;s coup, Tang officials immediately sent an army to support the dethroned pro-Tang king clearly interfering in Khitan internal affairs.

The 730–734 war seems to have been the consequence of both Chinese revitalized foreign policy, Khitan internal turmoil and associated oppression of Ketuyu and the miscalculations made by him.

=== An Lushan era (750s) ===

====Rise of An Lushan and Chinese-on-Khitan hostilities====
By the 730s regional commanders already have largely autonomy of initiative to face neighbouring threats and accordingly boundary wars and rebellions are understood by many scholars as the full responsibility of local general commanders.

In the third month of 736 Zhang Shougui, the general commander of Youzhou, sent his protected An Lushan, an officer of the Pinglu Army (平盧軍) based in modern Chaoyang who was said to know 6 languages of Chinese, to attack Khitan and the Xi rebels but An Lushan made an overtly audacious attack which cost him almost all of his troops. He escaped the usual execution for such disobedience cases in part because of Zhangs affection for him and in part thanks to Emperor Xuanzong who, overviewing death penalty cases, believed that his audacious and mid-barbarian character should not pay by death.

Youzhou soon became the &quot;Bingmashi&quot; (兵馬使) &quot;of the Pinglu Army&quot; in the seventh month of 741. He carefully cultivated relationships with other officials and generals to earn praises and bribed Imperial messengers to include him in their reports. As the consequence of this systematic bribery he was promoted to &quot;commandant at Yingzhou&quot; (Ying prefecture) and &quot;Jiedushi&quot; (&quot;military governor&quot;) of the Pinglu army in 742 to face and defeat the northern threat from Khitans, Xi, Balhae and Heishui Mohe. He was made military governor of Fanyang Circuit (范陽, headquartered in modern Beijing) in 744 plundering Khitan and Xi villages to display his military abilities. This continuous harassment of Khitan is understood by some scholars as provocation to the Khitan aggressiveness and the threat aimed to get more troops from Chang&#x27;an for his future rebellion as well as the reason for the 745 Khitan-Xi rebellion.

As commander of the northeastern frontier in 744–755 An Lushan organised military operations against the Khitan-Xi nomads. His motivation was to curry favour with the Tang court and probably also to obtain more troops. He needed these for his subsequent campaigns to defeat what he saw as the enormous threat presented by the northeastern &quot;barbarians&quot; amongst who the Khitan were the most significant. He may also have been motivated by thoughts of preparing for his future rebellion of 755–763.

The rebel An Lushan had a Khitan eunuch named Li Zhu&#x27;er (李豬兒) (Li Chu-erh) who was working for An Lushan when he was a teenager but An Lushan used a sword to sever his genitals as he almost died losing multiple pints of blood. An Lushan revived him after smearing ashes on his injury. Li Zhu&#x27;er was An Lushan&#x27;s eunuch after this and highly used and trusted by him. Li Zhu&#x27;er and another 2 men helped carry the obese An Lushan when he was taking off or wearing his clothes. Li Zhu&#x27;er helped cloth and take of his clothes at the Huaqing (Hua-ch&#x27;ing) steam baths granted by Emperor Xuanzang. Li Zhuer was approached by people who wanted to assassinate An Lushan after An Lushan became paranoid and blind, stricken with skin disease and started flogging and murdering his subordinates. An Lushan was hacked to death in his stomach and abdomen by Li Zhuer and another conspirator, Yan Zhuang (Yen Chuang) (嚴莊) who was beaten by An before. An Lushan screamed &quot;this is a thief of my own household&quot; as he desperately shook his curtains since he could not find his sword to defend himself. An Lushan&#x27;s intestines came out of his body as he was hacked to death by Li Zhuer and Yan Zhuang. A horse was once crushed to death under An Lushan&#x27;s sheer weight due to his fatness.

====745s Khitan rebellion====
In the third month of 745 several Tang princesses were married to Khitan&#x27;s leaders in a sign of appeasement. But for some reason the Khitans soon turned into an open rebellion against Tang in the ninth month of 745 killing the princesses and starting military operations. Huge previous pressures from An Lushan combined with the Chang&#x27;an courts praise for him may have been seen Khitan as presenting an impasse against which they eventually revolted.

The Khitans were quickly defeated by An Lushan&#x27;s troops by punitive expeditions and traps. Sources report that Banquets for a peace declaration were set up by An Lushan and offered to Khitan and Xi who, happy to get both peace and free provisions, rushed to the buffet and drunk heavily. It turned out that the food and wine were poisoned by narcotics. An Lushan then led his warriors to kill all of those who were sleeping on the ground or drunk enough to be easy to kill and the Chiefs&#x27; heads were sent to the Tang court for display. Sources have said that each of such Banquets ended with the death of thousands of warriors. This claim is difficult to believe: can Khitan have been that naive to let An Lushan kill thousands of them, several times, in the same kind of &quot;free food traps&quot;. The difficulty is that Chinese sources seem biased against An Lushan depicting him by this story as a terrible untrustable enemy. The final result was that Khitan&#x27;s 745 rebellion was crushed.

====751–752s wars to 755s An Shi rebellion====
In 751–752, following An Lushan&#x27;s provocations and harassment, the Khitans moved south to attack the Chinese Tang Empire. Accordinglys Khitan were soon subject to a Chinese campaign in the eighth month of 751: An Lushan assisted by 2,000 Xi guides leading 60,000 Chinese troops into Khitan territories. When the fighting started the Xi suddenly turned their support to Khitan and the Khitan-Xi army then quickly pushed against the Tang armies who were hampered by rains. The Khitan-Xi army killed almost all the enemy soldiers while An Lushan escaped to Shizhou with just twenty cavalrymen. The defending general Su Dingfang, a Tang general, was eventually able to stop the Khitan pursuit troops which retreated. They had their battlefield victory, although not An Lushan&#x27;s head, and so they laid siege to the city which only Shi Siming (one An Lushan&#x27;s general) was able to end. One of his generals was killed in action and, after retreating, he blamed and executed the other two for the defeat.

In 752, to punish this audacity and insult, a 200,000 strong army including both Chinese and barbarian infantry and cavalry went northwards to meet the Khitan. But while An Lushan requested that the ethnically Tujue general Li Xianzhong (李獻忠) accompany him Li feared An and, when compelled to, rebelled putting a halt to An&#x27;s campaign. After three years in the month fourth of 755 An announced his victory about which historical records are not very clear. By this time An Lushan was already engaged in an opposition to the Yang clan located in Chang&#x27;an which turned around his system of alliances. Put into an impasse he rose into rebellion and had to walk southwards to quickly beat the unprotected heartland of the Tang territories. In this movement he looked for assistance from the northern nomads: Tujue, Uighurs, Khitan, Xi and Shiwei. All, to some extent, assisted his troops and his rebellion, Khitan principally by his previously taken prisoners&#x27;. But the Khitan were exhausted and took little part in these campaigns.

;Background reasons of these oppositions
The continuous agitation of Khitans on the northeast of the Empire, maintained by An Lushan actions, provided An Lushan more and more support troops from Chang&#x27;an for his own power and ambitions growing to 160,000–200,000 men. This was caused by several factors:
* An Lushan seemed to be a clever military official especially skilled to set up good relationships with his superiors, whatever by systematic brides (as say sources) or by his possible real abilities;
* An Lushan was skilled to both: up Khitan&#x27;s aggressivity, enlarge the threat in his rapports, and trap/crush them, getting large praises
* the time (740s) was an apogee of prosperity, the treasury was full, the Chinese Empire was at a maximum of extension, Xuanzong and Chang&#x27;an officials sur-estimated their own power and displayed growing mark of lazy behaviour and management: waste of financial resources, lack of troops in the Central area;
* in Chang&#x27;an, the high chancellor Li Linfu, facing to the rise of the Yang clan in Chang&#x27;an, wanted both to resist the Khitans&#x27; pressure and counterbalance the growing influence of the Yang clan in Chang&#x27;an affairs.

Accordingly, An Lushan&#x27;s power strengthened with associated pressure on the Khitan.

The turning point came when An became worried about the post of Xuanzong-Li Linfu (An Lushan add &quot;get their favor&quot;, but at the cost of relations with other officials). Noticing that the heart of the empire was without defenses An considered to plan a rebellion. He selected a dozen able generals and some 8,000 soldiers from amongst the surrendered Khitan, Xi, and Tongluo (同羅) tribesmen organizing them into an elite corps known as the &quot;Yeluohe&quot; (曵落河, &quot;the brave&quot;).

When Li Linfu died and Yang Guozhong, a Yang clan member, replaced him as high chancellor An Lushan rose in rebellion with his armies and attacked the central power with Khitan, Xi and Turkish supporters.
=== 2nd half of the Tang dynasty (763–907) ===
;Middle of Tang&#x27;s dynasty
The Khitan were concentrating themselves on their own development and were relatively peaceful.

;Uighurs domination and Khitans state
When the Turks were overthrown by the Uighurs in 745, the war-loving power of the Turks was replaced by the commerce-loving Uighurs. The control that the Uighurs had on the Khitans were of a different kind. Uighurs were focusing on economic exchanges, were the protectors of the diplomatic stability and left large political and internal freedom to their vassals. The Khitans used this to keep a peaceful environment helping to strengthen all their demographic, economic and structural force.

For their demographic the main point was the choice to avoid foreign conflicts. The new &quot;Steppe Lords&quot; were relatively peaceful while the Tang dynasty was later greatly weakened by the An-Shi rebellion of 755–763 providing a new intra-China situation with a weak center and with provincial generals pacification and strengthening of their respective provinces. In this context the Khitans and their close-relatives the Xi had opposite strategies. Kumo Xi kept a relatively aggressive foreign policy slowly exhausting their forces. The Khitans chose to stay as a calm self-defensive power enjoying most of the Manchurian plain and working to improve their daily situation. While previous centuries had seen successive Turko-Chinese provocations or recall to obeisance, and the following wars had prevented Khitan gaining any notable expansion, the 8th-century situation eventually allowed one. This demographic growth would strongly support the other qualitative changes.
=== Pre-dynastic Khitan&#x27;s allegiances and reasons ===
* Pre-388 : Kumo Xi – submitted to the Turks. Part of the Kumo Xi-Khitan tribal complex
* 388–?: Later (383–409) and Northern Yan (409–436) – a result of the 388 Kumo Xi defeat facing the Northern Wei
* 479–?: Northern Wei – to avoid a Rouran-Goguryean invasion
* 560s(?)–?: some tribes submitted to Goguryeo to avoid Northern Qi and Eastern Turk threats;

* 648–696: Tang dynasty– because of recent Tang expansion and following the Turkish collapse.
* 696–697 : independent (Li-Sun Rebellion) and in war on all sides, encouraged by Tujue and caused by Chinese official mistreatment and famine.
* 697–720s : Tang dynasty+ Tujue, since the 697 defeat.
* 730–734: Turks – Ketuyu Rebellion caused by Tang interventionism and Tang&#x27;s chancellors mistreatment.
* 734–? : Tang dynasty – because of recent defeat.
* &quot;To complete&quot;

==Liao dynasty (916–1125)==


The Liao dynasty was founded in 916 when Abaoji, posthumously known by his temple name as Emperor Taizu, was named the leader of the Khitan tribal confederation. The dynastic name &quot;Great Liao&quot; was proclaimed in 947 by his successor, the Emperor Taizong of Liao.

Though Abaoji died in 926 the dynasty would last nearly two more centuries. Five cities were designated as capitals during that dynasty. In addition to the supreme capital in the heartland of Khitan territory there were four regional capitals. One of which was Beijing which became a capital for the first time in its history. It was not the principle capital of the dynasty but rather was designated as the southern capital after the Khitan acquired the contentious Sixteen Prefectures in 935.

Abaoji introduced a number of innovations – some more successful than others. He divided the empire into two parts: one was governed based on nomadic models while the sedentary population was governed largely in accordance with Chinese techniques. Less successful was the attempted introduction of primogeniture in succession to the throne. Although he desired his eldest son to be heir he did not succeed Abaoji.

Abaoji was &quot;afraid that their use of Chinese advisers and administrative techniques would blur their own ethnic identity, the Khitan made a conscious effort to retain their own tribal rites, food, and clothing and refused to use the Chinese language, devising a writing system for their own language instead.&quot; The first of these two scripts was created in 920. The second, based on alphabetic principles, was created five years later.

Before the Jurchens overthrew their Khitan rulers, married Jurchen women and Jurchen girls were raped by Liao dynasty Khitan envoys as a custom which caused resentment by the Jurchens against the Khitan. Liao Khitan envoys among the Jurchens were treated to guest prostitutes by their Jurchen hosts. Unmarried Jurchen girls and their families hosted the Liao envoys who had sex with the girls. Song envoys among the Jin were similarly entertained by singing girls in Guide, Henan. Although the Liao Khitan had superior power over the Jurchens when ruling them there were no evidence that guest prostitution of unmarried Jurchen girls to Khitan men was hated or resented by the Jurchens. It was only when the Liao Khitan forced aristocratic Jurchen families to give up their beautiful wives as guest prostitutes to Liao Khitan messengers stirred resentment and anger by the Jurchens. A historian has speculated that this could mean that in Jurchen upper classes, only a husband had the right to his married wife while among lower class Jurchens, unmarried girls virginity and sleeping with Liao Khitan men did not matter and did not impede their ability to marry later. The Jurchens sexual habits and norms were seemed lax to Han Chinese, such as marrying with an in-law, which was one of China&#x27;s &quot;Ten Heinous Crimes&quot;. Jurchens very commonly practiced guest prostitution giving female companions, food and shelter to guests. Unmarried daughters of Jurchen families of lower and middle classes in native Jurchen villages were provided to Liao Kitan messengers for sexual intercourse and amusement as recorded by Hong Hao (Hung Hao). Marco Polo also reported that Hami (Camul) guest prostitution was practiced with hosts giving their female relatives, sisters, daughters and wives to guests in their house. Tanguts practiced this guest prostitution.

==Post-Liao dynasty history==

The Khitans were absorbed by the Jurchens and widely used in the following years of war to conquer the northern Song territories.

In contrast a number of the nobles of the Liao dynasty escaped the area towards the Western Regions establishing the Qara Khitai (Western Liao dynasty). They were in turn absorbed by the local Turkic and Iranian populations and left no influence of themselves. As the Khitan language is still almost completely illegible it is difficult to create a detailed history of their movements. The Khitans were mainly employed by the Mongols in military and civil services after they conquered most of Eurasia. The Daur people and some Baarin people are direct descendants of the Khitans.

On the Eastern front, Khitans elements fled the Mongol offensives toward Korea. In 1216 the Khitans invaded Goryeo and defeated the Korean armies multiple times, even reaching the gates of the capital and raiding deep into the south, but were defeated by Korean General Kim Chwi-ryeo who pushed them back north to Pyongan, where the remaining Khitans were finished off by allied Mongol-Goryeo forces in 1219. These Khitans are possibly the origin of the Baekjeong.

<doc id="166324" wikidata="Q33050" url="?curid=166324" title="Dungan language">
<text>Dungan ( or ) is a Sinitic language spoken primarily in the Chu Valley of southeastern Kazakhstan and northern Kyrgyzstan. It is the native language of the Dungan people, a Hui subgroup that fled Qing China in the 19th century. It evolved from the Central Plains Mandarin variety spoken in Gansu and Shaanxi. It is the only Sino-Tibetan language to be officially written in the Cyrillic script. In addition, the Dungan language contains loanwords and archaisms not found in other modern varieties of Mandarin.

== History ==
The Dungan people of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan (with smaller groups living in other post-Soviet states) are the descendants of several groups of the Hui people that migrated to the region in the 1870s and the 1880s after the defeat of the Dungan revolt in Northwestern China. The Hui of Northwestern China (often referred to as &quot;Dungans&quot; or &quot;Tungani&quot; by 19th-century western writers, as well as by some Turkic peoples) would normally speak the same Mandarin dialect as the Han people in the same area (or in the area from which the particular Hui community had been resettled). At the same time, due to their unique history, their speech would be rich in Islamic or Islam-influenced terminology, based on loanwords from Arabic, Persian and Turkic languages, as well as translations of them into Chinese. The Hui traders in the bazaars would be able to use Arabic or Persian numbers when talking between themselves, to keep their communications secret from Han bystanders. While not constituting a separate language, these words, phrases and turns of speech, known as &quot;Huihui hua&quot; (, &quot;Hui speech&quot;), served as markers of group identity. As early 20th century travellers in Northwestern China would note, &quot;the Mohammedan Chinese have to some extent a vocabulary and always a style and manner of speech, all their own&quot;.

As the Dungans in the Russian Empire — and even more so in the Soviet Union — were isolated from China, their language experienced significant influence from the Russian and the Turkic languages of their neighbors.

In the Soviet Union, a written standard of the Dungan language was developed, based on a dialect of the Gansu Province, rather than the Beijing base of Standard Chinese. The language was used in the schools in Dungan villages. In the Soviet time there were several school textbooks published for studying the Dungan language, a three volume Russian–Dungan dictionary (14,000 words), the Dungan–Russian dictionary, linguistics monographs on the language and books in Dungan. The first Dungan-language newspaper was established in 1932; it continues publication today in weekly form.

When Dru C. Gladney, who had spent some years working with the Hui people in China, met with Dungans in Almaty in 1988, he described the experience as speaking &quot;in a hybrid Gansu dialect that combined Turkish and Russian lexical items&quot;.

== Mutual intelligibility with Mandarin dialects ==
There is a varying degree of mutual intelligibility between Dungan and various Mandarin dialects. The Central Plains Mandarin varieties and Jin Chinese are both understood by Dungans. On the other hand, Dungan speakers like Iasyr Shivaza and others have reported that people who speak the Beijing Mandarin dialect can understand Dungan, but Dungans could not understand Beijing Mandarin.

== Demographics ==
Dungan is spoken primarily in Kyrgyzstan, with speakers in Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as well. The Dungan ethnic group are the descendants of refugees from China who migrated west into Central Asia.

According to the Soviet census statistics from 1970 to 1989, the Dungan maintained the use of their ethnic language much more successfully than other minority ethnic groups in Central Asia; however, in the post-Soviet period, the proportion of Dungans speaking the Dungan language as their native language appears to have fallen sharply.

== Grammar ==
=== Classifiers ===

Chinese varieties usually have different classifiers for different types of nouns, with northern varieties tending to have fewer classifiers than southern ones. () is the only classifier found in the Dungan language, though not the only measure word.

== Phonology ==
In basic structure and vocabulary, the Dungan language is not very different from Mandarin Chinese, specifically a variety of Zhongyuan Mandarin (not Lan-Yin Mandarin) spoken in the southern part of the province of Gansu and the western part of the valley of Guanzhong in the province of Shaanxi. Like other Chinese varieties, Dungan is tonal. There are two main dialects, one with 4 tones and the other, considered standard, with 3 tones in the final position in phonetic words and 4 tones in the nonfinal position.

=== Consonants ===
* can also be heard as a voiced fricative among other Gansw dialects.
* can be heard as in the Şanşi dialects.

=== Vowels ===
* can be heard as in Kyrgyzstan.

Vowel constructs that can be used as independent syllable without consonants are shown in parentheses. There are rhotacised vowels, as well as some syllables only seen in loan words from Russian, Arabic, Kyrgyz, etc., in addition to the above table.

=== Tones ===
Tones in Dungan are marked with nothing (tone 1), a ъ (tone 2) and ь (tone 3).
== Vocabulary ==
The basilects of Gansu/Shaanxi Mandarin and Dungan are largely mutually intelligible; Chinese journalists conversant in one of those Mandarin dialects report that they can make themselves understood when communicating with Dungan speakers. However, even at the level of basic vocabulary, Dungan contains many words not present in modern Mandarin dialects, such as Russian, Arabic, Turkic, and Persian loanwords. Furthermore, Dungan contains some archaic Qing dynasty-era Chinese vocabulary. Because of this, some Dungan vocabulary may sound archaic to Chinese people. For example, they refer to a President as an &quot;Emperor&quot; (Хуаңды/皇帝, &quot;huan&#x27;g-di&quot;) and call government offices &quot;yamen&quot; (ямын/衙門, &quot;ya-min&quot;), a term for mandarins&#x27; offices in ancient China.

Furthermore, the acrolects of Dungan and Gansu/Shaanxi Mandarin have diverged significantly due to time and cultural influences. During the 20th century, translators and intellectuals introduced many neologisms and calques into the Chinese language, especially for political and technical concepts. However, the Dungan, cut off from the mainstream of Chinese discourse by orthographic barriers, instead borrowed words for those same concepts from Russian, with which they came into contact through government and higher education. As a result of these borrowings, the equivalent standard Chinese terms are not widely known or understood among the Dungan.

== Writing system ==

The modern Dungan language is the only Chinese language that is written in the Cyrillic alphabet, as they lived under Soviet rule. It is a Russian-based alphabet plus five additional letters: Ә, Җ, Ң, Ү and Ў. As such, it differs from the Palladius System that is normally used in Russia to render Chinese in Cyrillic.


*The letters ъ and ь are only used to write Russian loanwords and tone markings on children&#x27;s primers dictionaries

Dungan is unique in that it is one of the few varieties of Chinese that is not normally written using Chinese characters. Though it may be seen written in Chinese characters, this writing system is now considered obsolete. Originally, the Dungan, as descendants of the Hui, wrote their language in an Arabic-based alphabet known as Xiao&#x27;erjing. The Soviet Union banned all Arabic scripts in 1925, which led to a Latin orthography based on Yañalif. The Latin orthography lasted until 1940, when the Soviet government promulgated the current Cyrillic-based system. Xiao&#x27;erjing is now virtually extinct in Dungan society, but it remains in limited use by some Hui communities in China.

The writing system is based on the standard 3-tone dialect. Tone marks or numbering do not appear in general-purpose writing, but are specified in dictionaries, even for loanwords. The tones are specified using the soft sign, hard sign, or none.

=== Comparison with Palladius system ===
== Literature ==
A number of books in the Dungan language, which includes textbooks, Dungan-Russian and Russian-Dungan dictionaries, a Dungan etymological dictionary, collections of folk tales, original and translated fiction, and poetry have been published in Kyrgyzstan. Usual print runs were no more than a few hundred copies. A newspaper in Dungan has been published as well.

Many literary works of Dungan poet Iasyr Shivaza have been translated into Russian, Standard Chinese and a number of other languages, with print runs in some of them been much higher than in the original Dungan. English translations of some of them, along with the original Dungan text, are available in the book by S. Rimsky-Korsakoff (1991).

<text>Dungan is a term used in territories of the former Soviet Union to refer to a group of Muslim people of Hui origin. Turkic-speaking peoples in Xinjiang also sometimes refer to Hui Muslims as Dungans. In both China and the former Soviet republics where they reside, however, members of this ethnic group call themselves Hui because Dungans are descendants of historical Hui groups that migrated to Central Asia.

In the censuses of the countries of the former Soviet Union, the Dungans (enumerated separately from Chinese) are found in Kazakhstan (36,900 according to the 1999 census), Kyrgyzstan (58,409 according to the 2009 census) and Russia (801 according to the 2002 census).

==History==
=== Migration from China ===
In the Ferghana Valley, the first Dungans to appear in Central Asia originated from Kuldja and Kashgar, as slaves captured by raiders; they mostly served in private wealthy households. After the Russians conquered Central Asia in the late 19th century and abolished slavery, most female Dungan slaves remained where they had originally been held captive. Russian ethnographer Vlaidimir Petrovich Nalivkin and his wife said that &quot;women slaves almost all remained in place, because they either were married to workers and servants of their former owners or they were too young to begin an independent life&quot;. Dungan women slaves were of low status and not regarded highly in Bukhara.

Turkic Muslim slave-raiders from Khoqand did not distinguish between Hui Muslim and Han Chinese, enslaving Hui Muslims in violation of Islamic law. During the Afaqi Khoja revolts Turkic Muslim Khoja Jahangir Khoja led an invasion of Kashgar from the Kokand Khanate and Jahangir&#x27;s forces captured several hundred Dungan Chinese Muslims (Tungan or Hui) who were taken to Kokand. Tajiks bought two Chinese slaves from Shaanxi; they were enslaved for a year before being returned by the Tajik Beg Ku-bu-te to China. All Dungans captured, both merchants and the 300 soldiers Janhangir captured in Kashgar, had their queues cut off when brought to Kokand and Central Asia as prisoners. Many of the captives became slaves. Accounts of these slaves in Central Asia increased. The queues were removed from Dungan Chinese Muslim prisoners and then sold or given away. Some of them escaped to Russian territory where they were repatriated back to China and the accounts of their captures were recorded in Chinese records. The Russians record an incident where they rescued these Chinese Muslim merchants who escaped, after they were sold by Jahangir&#x27;s Army in Central Asia and sent them back to China.

The Dungan in the former Soviet republics are Hui who fled China in the aftermath of the Hui Minorities&#x27; War (also known as the &quot;Dungan Rebellion&quot;) in the 19th century. According to Rimsky-Korsakoff (1992), three separate groups of the Hui people fled to the Russian Empire across the Tian Shan mountains during the exceptionally severe winter of 1877/78 after the end of the Hui Minorities&#x27; War:
# The first group, of some 1000 people, originally from Turpan in Xinjiang, led by Ma Daren (馬大人, &#x27;the Great Man Ma&#x27;), also known as Ma Da-lao-ye (馬大老爺, &#x27;the Great Master Ma&#x27;), reached Osh in Southern Kyrgyzstan.
# The second group, originally from Didaozhou (狄道州) in Gansu, led by &quot;ahong&quot; Ma Yusuf (馬郁素夫), also known as Ah Ye Laoren (阿爺老人, &#x27;the Old Man O&#x27;Granpa&#x27;), were settled in the spring of 1878 in the village of Yrdyk ( or Ырдык) some 15 km from Karakol in Eastern Kyrgyzstan. They numbered 1130 on arrival.
# The third group, originally from Shaanxi, led by Bai Yanhu (白彦虎; also spelt Bo Yanhu; often called by his followers &quot;虎大人&quot;, &#x27;The Great Man Hu (Tiger)&#x27;, 1829(?)-1882), one of the leaders of the rebellion, were settled in the village of Karakunuz (now Masanchi), in modern Zhambyl Province of Kazakhstan. It is 8 km north of the city Tokmak in northwestern Kyrgyzstan. This group numbered 3314 on arrival. Bai Yanhu&#x27;s name in other romanizations was Bo-yan-hu or Pai Yen-hu; other names included Boyan-akhun (Akhund or Imam Boyan) and Muhammad Ayyub.

The next wave of immigration followed in the early 1880s. In accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881), which required the withdrawal of the Russian troops from the Upper Ili basin (the Kulja area), the Dungan (Hui) and Taranchi (Uyghur) people of the region were allowed to opt to move to the Russian side of the border. Many chose to do so; according to Russian statistics, 4,682 Hui moved to the Russian Empire under the treaty. They migrated in many small groups between 1881 and 1883, settling in the village of Sokuluk some 30 km west of Bishkek, as well as in a number of locations between the Chinese border and Sokuluk, in southeastern Kazakhstan and in northern Kyrgyzstan.

===Name===

In the Russian Empire, Soviet Union, and the post-Soviet states, the Dungans continue to refer to themselves as the &quot;Hui people&quot; (, Huízú; in Cyrillic Soviet Dungan spelling, xуэйзў).

The name &quot;Dungan&quot; is of obscure origin. One popular theory derives this word from Turkic &quot;döñän&quot; (&quot;one who turns&quot;), which can be compared to Chinese (huí), which has a similar meaning. Another theory derives it from the Chinese 东甘 (Dong Gan), &#x27;Eastern Gansu&#x27;, the region to which many of the Dungan can trace their ancestry; however the character &quot;gan&quot; (干) used in the name of the ethnic group is different from that used in the name of the province (甘).

The term &quot;Dungan&quot; (&quot;Tonggan&quot;, &quot;Donggan&quot;) has been used by Central Asian Turkic-and Tajik-speaking people to refer to Chinese-speaking Muslims for several centuries. Joseph Fletcher cites Turkic and Persian manuscripts related to the preaching of the 17th century Kashgarian Sufi master Muhammad Yūsuf (or, possibly, his son Afaq Khoja) inside the Ming Empire (in today&#x27;s Gansu and/or Qinghai), where the Kashgarian preacher is told to have converted &quot;&#x27;ulamā-yi Tunganiyyān&quot; (i.e., &quot;Dungan ulema&quot;) into Sufism.

Presumably, it was from the Turkic languages that the term was borrowed into Russian (дунгане, &quot;dungane&quot; (pl.); дунганин, &quot;dunganin&quot; (sing.)) and Chinese (), as well as to Western European languages.
In English and German, the ethnonym &quot;Dungan&quot;, in various spellings, has been attested as early as the 1830s, typically referring to the Hui people of Xinjiang. For example, James Prinsep in 1835 mentioned Muslim &quot;Túngánis&quot; in &quot;Chinese Tartary&quot;. In 1839, Karl Ernst von Baer in his German-language account of Russian Empire and adjacent Asian lands has a one-page account of Chinese-speaking Muslim &quot;Dungani&quot; or &quot;Tungani&quot;, who visited Orenburg in 1827 with a caravan from China; he also mentions &quot;Tugean&quot; as a spelling variant used by other authors. R.M. Martin in 1847 mentions &quot;Tungani&quot; merchants in Yarkand.

The word (mostly in the form &quot;Dungani&quot; or &quot;Tungani&quot;, sometimes &quot;Dungens&quot; or &quot;Dungans&quot;) acquired some currency in English and other western languages when a number of books in the 1860-1870s discussed the Dungan rebellion in northwestern China. At the time, European and American authors applied the term &quot;Tungani&quot; to the Hui people both in Xinjiang,
and in Shaanxi and Gansu (which at the time included today&#x27;s Ningxia and Qinghai as well). Authors aware of the general picture of the spread of Islam in China, viewed these &quot;Tungani&quot; as just one of the groups of China&#x27;s Muslims.

Marshall Broomhall, who has a chapter on &quot;the Tungan Rebellion&quot; in his 1910 book, introduces &quot;the name Tungan or Dungan, by which the Muslims of these parts [i.e., NE China] are designated, as distinguished from the Chinese Buddhists who were spoken of as Kithay. The reference to &quot;Khitay&quot; shows that he was observing the two terms as used by Turkic speakers. Broomhall&#x27;s book also contains a translation of the report on Chinese Muslims by the Ottoman writer named Abd-ul-Aziz. Abd-ul-Aziz divides the &quot;Tungan people&quot; into two branches: &quot;the Tunagans of China proper&quot; (including, apparently all Hui people in &quot;China proper&quot;, as he also talks e.g. about the Tungans having 17 mosques in Beijing), and &quot;The Tungans of Chinese and Russian Turkestan&quot;, who still looked and spoke Chinese, but had often also learned the &quot;Turkish&quot; language.

Later authors continued to use the term Dungan (in various transcriptions) for, specifically, the Hui people of Xinjiang.
For example, Owen Lattimore, writing c. 1940, maintains the terminological distinction between these two related groups: &quot;T&#x27;ungkan&quot; (i.e. Wade-Giles for &quot;Dungan&quot;), described by him as the descendants of the Gansu Hui people resettled in Xinjiang in 17–18th centuries, vs. e.g. &quot;Gansu Moslems&quot; or generic &quot;Chinese Moslems&quot;. The term (usually as &quot;Tungans&quot;) continues to be used by many modern historians writing about the 19th century Dungan Rebellion (e.g., by Denis C. Twitchett in The Cambridge History of China, by James A. Millward in his economic history of the region, or by Kim Ho-dong in his monograph).

===Dungan villages in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan===
The Dungans themselves referred to Karakunuz (, sometimes Караконыз or Караконуз) as &quot;Ingpan&quot; (, Yingpan; ), which means &#x27;a camp, an encampment&#x27;. In 1965, Karakunuz was renamed Masanchi (sometimes spelt as &quot;Masanchin&quot;), after Magaza Masanchi or Masanchin (Dungan: Магәзы Масанчын; ), a Dungan participant in the Communist Revolution and a statesman of Soviet Kazakhstan.

The following table summarizes location of Dungan villages in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, alternative names used for them, and their Dungan population as reported by Ma Tong (2003). The Cyrillic Dungan spelling of place names is as in the textbook by Sushanlo, Imazov (1988); the spelling of the name in Chinese characters is as in Ma Tong (2003).
The position of the Kazakhstan villages within the administrative division of Jambyl Region, and the total population of each village can be found at the provincial statistics office web site.

Besides the traditionally Dungan villages, many Dungan people live in the nearby cities, such as Bishkek, Tokmok, Karakol.

===Soviet rule===
During World War II, some Dungans served in the Red Army, one of them who was (Cyrillic Dungan: мансуза ванахун; ) a Dungan war &quot;hero&quot; who led a &quot;mortar battery&quot;.

Reportedly, Dungans were &quot;strongly anti-Japanese&quot;. During the 1930s, a White Russian driver for Nazi German agent Georg Vasel in Xinjiang was afraid to meet Hui general Ma Zhongying, saying: &quot;You know how the Tungans hate the Russians.&quot; Vasel passed the Russian driver off as a German.

===Present day===

As Ding (2005) notes, &quot;[t]he Dungan people derive from China&#x27;s Hui people, and now live mainly in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Their population is about 110,000. This people have now developed a separate ethnicity outside China, yet they have close relations with the Hui people in culture, ethnic characteristics and ethnic identity.&quot; Today the Dungans play a role as cultural &quot;shuttles&quot; and economic mediators between Central Asia and the Chinese world. Husei Daurov, the president of the Dungan center, has succeeded in transforming cultural exchanges into commercial partnerships.

In February 2020, a conflict broke out between ethnic Kazakhs and Dungans in the Korday area in Kazakhstan on the border to Kyrgyzstan. According to official Kazakh sources, 10 people were killed and many more were wounded. In the altercation, cars and homes were burned and rifles were fired. 600 people fled across the border to Kyrgyzstan.

==Language==
The Dungan language, which the Dungan people call the &quot;Hui language&quot; (Хуэйзў йүян/回族語言 or &quot;Huejzw jyian&quot;), is similar to the Zhongyuan dialect of Mandarin Chinese, which is widely spoken in the south of Gansu and the west of Guanzhong in Shaanxi in China.

Like other varieties of Chinese, Dungan is tonal. There are two main dialects, one with four tones and the other, considered standard, with three tones in the final position in words and four tones in the non-final position.

Some Dungan vocabulary may sound archaic to Chinese people. For example, they refer to a President as an &quot;Emperor&quot; (Хуаңды/皇帝, &quot;huan&#x27;g-di&quot;) and call government offices &quot;yamen&quot; (ямын/衙門, &quot;ya-min&quot;), a term for mandarins&#x27; offices in ancient China. Their language also contains many loanwords from Russian, Arabic, Persian and Turkic. Since the 1940s, the language has been written in Cyrillic script, though the language has historically also used Chinese characters and Xiao&#x27;erjing (Arabic script used for Chinese), though these are now considered obsolete.

Dungan people are generally multilingual. In addition to Dungan Chinese, more than two-thirds of the Dungan speak Russian and a small proportion can speak Kyrgyz or other languages belonging to the titular nationalities of the countries where they live.

==Culture==

Nineteenth century explorer Henry Lansdell noted that the Dungan people abstained from spirits and opium, neither smoked nor took snuff and
&quot;are of middle height, and inclined to be stout. They have high and prominent foreheads, thick and arched eyebrows, eyes rather sunken, fairly prominent cheek-bones, face oval, mouth of average size, lips thick, teeth normal, chin round, ears small and compressed, hair black and smooth, beard scanty and rough, skin smooth, neck strong, and extremities of average proportions. The characteristics of the Dungans are kindness, industry, and hospitality.
They engage in husbandry, horticulture, and trade. In domestic life parental authority is very strong. After the birth of a child the mother does not get up for fifteen days, and, without any particular feast, the child receives its name in the presence of a mullah the day succeeding that of its birth. Circumcision takes place on the eighth, ninth, or tenth day. When a girl is married she receives a dower. In sickness they have recourse to medicine and doctors, but never to exorcisms. 
After death, the mullah and the aged assemble to recite prayers; the corpse is wrapped in white linen and then buried, but never burned. On returning from the interment the mullah and the elders partake of bread and meat. To saints they erect monuments like little mosques, for others simple hillocks. The widow may re-marry after 90 days, and on the third anniversary of the death a feast takes place.&quot;

The Dungan are primarily farmers, growing rice and vegetables such as sugar beet. Many also raise dairy cattle. In addition, some are involved in opium production. The Dungan tend to be endogamous.

The Dungan are well known for their hospitality and hold many ceremonies and banquets to preserve their culture. They have elaborate and colorful observances of birthdays, weddings, and funerals. In addition, schools have museums to preserve other parts of their culture, such as embroidery, traditional clothing, silver jewelry, paper cuts of animals and flowers and tools.

The Dungan still practice elements of Chinese culture, in cuisine and attire, up to 1948 they also practiced foot binding until the practice was banned by the Soviet government, and later the Chinese government. The conservative Shaanxi Dungan cling more tightly to Chinese customs than the Gansu Dungan.

The Dungans have retained Chinese traditions which have disappeared in modern China. Traditional marriage practices are still widespread with matchmakers, the marriages conducted by the Dungan are similar to Chinese marriages in the 19th century, hairstyles worn by women and attire date back to the Qing dynasty.

Shaanxi female attire is still Chinese, though the rest of the Dungans dress in western attire. Chopsticks are used by Dungans. The cuisine of the Dungan resembles northwestern Chinese cuisine. However, being Muslims they do not consume pork, one of the most popular meats in Chinese cuisine, and meat is procured in accordance to being halal.

Around the late 19th century the bride price was between 240 and 400 rubles for Dungan women. Dungans have been known to take other women such as Kirghiz and Tatars as brides willingly, or kidnap Kirghiz girls. Shaanxi Dungans are even conservative when marrying with other Dungans; they want only other Shaanxi Dungans marrying their daughters, while their sons are allowed to marry Gansu Dungan, Kirghiz, and Kazakh women. As recently as 1962, inter-ethnic marriage was reported to be anathema among Dungans.

==Identity==

During the Qing dynasty, the term Zhongyuanren () was synonymous with being mainstream Chinese, especially referring to Han Chinese and Hui Muslims in Xinjiang or Central Asia.

For religious reasons, while Hui people do not consider themselves Han and are not Han Chinese, they consider themselves part of the wider Chinese race and refer to themselves as Zhongyuanren. The Dungan people, descendants of Hui who fled to Central Asia, called themselves Zhongyuanren in addition to the standard labels Lao Huihui and Huizi. 

Zhongyuanren was used generally by Turkic Muslims to refer to Han and Hui Chinese people. When Central Asian invaders from Kokand invaded Kashgar, in a letter the Kokandi commander criticizes the Kashgari Turkic Muslim Ishaq for allegedly not behaving like a Turkic-origin Muslim and wanting to be a Zhongyuanren.

<doc id="166329" wikidata="Q183057" url="?curid=166329" title="Reiki">
<text>Reiki is a pseudoscientific form of energy healing, a type of alternative medicine originating in Japan. Reiki practitioners use a technique called &quot;palm healing&quot; or &quot;hands-on healing&quot; through which, according to practitioners, a &quot;universal energy&quot; is transferred through the palms of the practitioner to the client, to encourage emotional or physical healing. It is based on qi (&quot;chi&quot;), which practitioners say is a universal life force, although there is no empirical evidence that such a life force exists.

Reiki is used as an illustrative example of pseudoscience in scholarly texts and academic journal articles. The marketing of reiki has been described as &quot;fraudulent misrepresentation&quot;, and itself as a &quot;nonsensical method&quot;, with a recommendation that the American government agency NCCAM should stop funding reiki research because it &quot;has no substantiated health value and lacks a scientifically plausible rationale&quot;.

Clinical research does not show reiki to be effective as a treatment for any medical condition, including cancer, diabetic neuropathy, anxiety or depression. There is no proof of the effectiveness of reiki therapy compared to placebo. Studies reporting positive effects have had methodological flaws.

==Etymology==

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the English alternative medicine word &quot;reiki&quot; comes from Japanese () &quot;mysterious atmosphere, miraculous sign&quot;, combining &quot;universal&quot; and &quot;vital energy&quot;—the Sino-Japanese reading of Chinese () &quot;numinous atmosphere&quot;.

==Conceptual basis==
Reiki&#x27;s teachings and adherents claim that qi is a physiological force that can be manipulated to treat a disease or condition. There is no evidence that qi exists as an observable phenomenon. Reiki is thus classified as a pseudoscientific practice based on metaphysical, rather than physiological, concepts.

Most research on reiki is poorly designed and prone to bias. There is no reliable empirical evidence that reiki is helpful for treating any medical condition, although some physicians have said it might help promote feelings of general well-being. In 2011, William T. Jarvis of The National Council Against Health Fraud stated there &quot;is no evidence that clinical reiki&#x27;s effects are due to anything other than suggestion&quot; or the placebo effect.

The 22 April 2014 &quot;Skeptoid&quot; podcast episode entitled &quot;Your Body&#x27;s Alleged Energy Fields&quot; relates a reiki practitioner&#x27;s report of what was happening as she passed her hands over a subject&#x27;s body:
== Technique ==

A session usually lasts for approximately one hour. A &quot;Level 1&quot; practitioner places their hand or hands on or near various parts of the body for several minutes. During this time, a vital energy is meant to flow from the practitioner into the client&#x27;s body. &quot;Level 2&quot; practitioners alternatively may offer their services at a distance with no skin contact.

==Research and critical evaluation==

Reiki is used as an illustrative example of pseudoscience in scholarly texts and academic journal articles. David Gorski writes that reiki vies with homeopathy to be the &quot;one quackery that rules them all&quot; because of its &quot;sheer ridiculousness and disconnect from reality&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gorski_3/9/2020&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Jann Bellamy, a lawyer and critic of alternative medicine, has described the marketing of reiki as &quot;fraudulent misrepresentation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bellamy_6/12/2014&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In criticizing the State University of New York for offering a continuing education course on reiki, one source stated, &quot;reiki postulates the existence of a universal energy unknown to science and thus far undetectable surrounding the human body, which practitioners can learn to manipulate using their hands,&quot; and others said, &quot;In spite of its [reiki&#x27;s] diffusion, the baseline mechanism of action has not been demonstrated ...&quot; and, &quot;Neither the forces involved nor the alleged therapeutic benefits have been demonstrated by scientific testing.&quot;

Several authors have pointed to the vitalistic energy which reiki is claimed to treat, with one saying, &quot;Ironically, the only thing that distinguishes reiki from therapeutic touch is that it [reiki] involves actual touch,&quot; and others stating that the International Center for Reiki Training &quot;mimic[s] the institutional aspects of science&quot; seeking legitimacy but holds no more promise than an alchemy society.

A guideline published by the American Academy of Neurology, the American Association of Neuromuscular &amp; Electrodiagnostic Medicine, and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation states, &quot;Reiki therapy should probably not be considered for the treatment of PDN [painful diabetic neuropathy].&quot; Canadian sociologist Susan J. Palmer has listed reiki as among the pseudoscientific healing methods used by cults in France to attract members.

Stephen Barrett of Quackwatch describes reiki as a &quot;nonsensical method&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrett_3/3/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As a reason for why NCCAM should stop funding reiki research, he writes: &quot;Reiki has no substantiated health value and lacks a scientifically plausible rationale. Science-based healthcare settings should not tolerate its use, and scarce government research dollars should not be used to study it further.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrett_6/23/2009&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evidence quality ===

A 2008 systematic review of nine randomized clinical trials found several shortcomings in the literature on reiki. Depending on the tools used to measure depression and anxiety, the results varied and were not reliable or valid. Furthermore, the scientific community has been unable to replicate the findings of studies that support reiki. The review also found issues in reporting methodology in some of the literature, in that often there were parts omitted completely or not clearly described. Frequently in these studies, sample sizes were not calculated and adequate allocation and double-blind procedures were not followed. The review also reported that such studies exaggerated the effectiveness of treatment and there was no control for differences in experience of reiki practitioners or even the same practitioner at times produced different outcomes. None of the studies in the review provided a rationale for the treatment duration and no study reported adverse effects.

===Safety===
Safety concerns for reiki sessions are very low and are akin to those of many complementary and alternative medicine practices. Some physicians and health care providers, however, believe that patients may unadvisedly substitute proven treatments for life-threatening conditions with unproven alternative modalities including reiki, thus endangering their health.

==Training, certification and adoption==

A reiki practitioner who offers teaching is known as a &quot;reiki master&quot;.

There is no central authority controlling use of the words &quot;reiki&quot; or &quot;reiki master&quot;. Certificates can be purchased online for under $100. It is &quot;not uncommon&quot; for a course to offer attainment of reiki master in two weekends. There is no regulation of practitioners or reiki master in the United States.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in 2014 that in response to customer demand, at least 60 hospitals in the United States offered reiki, at a cost of between $40 and $300 per session. Cancer Research UK reported in 2019 that some cancer centers and hospices in the UK offer free or low-cost reiki for people with cancer. The cost per session for treatment vary widely, but a CNBC report found a practitioner charging $229 per session of 60–90 minutes.

==History==
Mikao Usui originated the practice in Japan. According to the inscription on his memorial stone, Usui taught his system of reiki to more than 2,000 people during his lifetime. While teaching reiki in Fukuyama, Usui suffered a stroke and died on 9 March 1926.

The first reiki clinic in the United States was started in 1970 by Hawayo Takata, a student of Chujiro Hayashi (who was a disciple of Usui).&lt;ref name=&quot;Joyce_Herbison_4/3/2015&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
