<text>CFNY-FM (102.1 MHz, &quot;102.1 The Edge&quot;) is a radio station licensed to Brampton, Ontario. Owned by Corus Entertainment, the station broadcasts a modern rock format serving the Greater Toronto Area. Its studios are in Downtown Toronto at Corus Quay on Toronto&#x27;s Harbourfront, and its transmitter is located atop the CN Tower.

==History==
===From CHIC to CFNY===
The station commenced operations on August 8, 1960, as an FM rebroadcast of an AM station, CHIC. On September 21, 1962, two brothers, Leslie and Harry Allen Jr., agreed to purchase all shares of CHIC Radio Ltd. from S.W. Caldwell, Frank M. Early, F.J. Shouldice, John Fox, W.S. Martin, Frank W. Richardson, Garth H. Ketemer, G. Clare Burt, J.R. Jenkins and Gordon F. Keeble. The sale occurred on October 15 later that year and was subject to government approval. They began playing album rock music in the evenings while simulcasting the AM programming during the day. The nearby Humber College provided a steady stream of young employees, who were encouraged to play their own selections. Noted Canadian radio and television personality Vicki Gabereau was one of such employees. At this point in the station&#x27;s existence, it operated under the call letters CHIC-FM, broadcasting about 30 hours per week, with a transmitter power of 857 watts ERP mono. This was enough to just service the town of Brampton.

Until approximately 1975, the AM control room operator spun LPs from the third turntable in AM master control. Nonstop full play of each side of the LP was the norm - with just a break by the AM operator for ID and to flip the LP over. The music was picked by the AM operator prior to their shift. Some of those on air people were Dave Gordon, Mike Lynch, Steve Martak, Rich Elwood, Ted Woloshyn, Scott Cameron; any genre of music was open to airtime.

The style of the station was well received by listeners. In 1976, a new FM studio was built just up the road from the old studio in Brampton on a very limited budget. Engineers Mike Hargrave Pawson and Steve Martak built the new studio and a new transmitter site in Georgetown to increase the coverage from 857 watts to 100 kW ERP, thus able to cover much of the Greater Toronto Area.

In 1976, CHIC-FM officially became CFNY-FM. The phrases &quot;Canada&#x27;s First New Youth&quot;, &quot;Canada Finds New Youth&quot;, and &quot;Canada&#x27;s Fresh New Youth&quot; have often been cited as backronyms for the call sign. Staff employed to that point were fired in favour of hiring a new team and David Pritchard joined the station as CFNY&#x27;s first program director. He had previously been a DJ at CHUM-FM, and under his guidance the station became more structured. It also began hosting specialty programs of reggae and blues music, and a popular, nationally syndicated Beatles show.

David Marsden, who had started as an announcer at the station, was selected as Pritchard&#x27;s successor in 1978.

===&quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot;===
During Marsden&#x27;s tenure as program director, the style of the station evolved into a sound which has been described as a more professional-sounding version of a campus radio station. At the time, alternative music was new and had not yet received wide exposure, but new wave and punk rock soon emerged as dominant forms of popular music—and so the station became known as one of the few commercial stations at the time which played alternative music.
During this period, the station began using &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; as a promotional catchphrase. In turn, listeners of the station began to refer to CFNY as &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot;. Canadian band Rush was unable to obtain airplay on many radio stations other than CFNY early in their career, and in 1979 wrote the song &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; about the station. Unable to mention CFNY directly for fear of alienating airplay on other stations, the band instead ensured the catalogue number for their album &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; was 1021, a nod to the station&#x27;s 102.1 FM frequency.

While the fan base was loyal, the station struggled to grow its audience due to its small studio and low broadcasting power of only 679 watts. With only a small broadcast range, the station used unconventional promotional strategies in an attempt to grow the brand. CFNY would send DJs to host regular new wave dance parties, both to build a community amongst its fans and to supplement the station&#x27;s limited advertising revenue through admission fees.

===Turbulence and expansion===
In 1979, the station&#x27;s original owners were involved in court action unrelated to CFNY and forced to sell the station. In spite of its problems, CFNY garnered praise from its listeners and other broadcasters alike. Referring to its free-form format, the station was called &quot;one of the last truly alternative radio stations in North America&quot;. When the new owners went bankrupt in 1979, the station received 6,200 letters and tens of thousands of names on a petition lobbying the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to &quot;save real radio.&quot;

With the Canadian economy in recession and interest rates high, the station&#x27;s owners sold the station to media conglomerate Selkirk Communications. Selkirk moved the station&#x27;s transmitter to the CN Tower in Toronto, thereby greatly increasing the broadcasting power and range of the station. By 1985, the station had reached new heights of popularity, capturing over 5.4% of the Toronto area listeners and becoming internationally famous for its music mix, due to its availability via satellite. By this time, the station&#x27;s dance party tradition had evolved into a large video dance party, hosted by Martin Streek, who joined the station as a DJ and on-air personality in 1984. This event regularly toured throughout southern Ontario and expanded the station&#x27;s influence well beyond its actual broadcast range. For a brief period, it was also available on satellite across North America, although this also led to the introduction of more &quot;popular&quot; music.

Through the early and mid-1980s, CFNY was well-respected for introducing new performers that other stations wouldn&#x27;t play due to not being well-known names, including Canadian artists such as Martha and the Muffins, Rough Trade, Blue Rodeo, Jane Siberry, 54-40, Skinny Puppy, and Spoons.

CFNY also created Canada&#x27;s first independent music awards, the U-Knows, the name of which was a pun on Canada&#x27;s mainstream Juno Awards. In 1986, the station held a listener contest to rename the awards, which were re-dubbed the CASBY Awards, for &quot;Canadian Artists Selected By You&quot;.

In 1987, after nine years in the position, David Marsden stepped down as program director. He was succeeded in the role by on-air personality Don Berns. Marsden moved to Vancouver, where he created and launched the variety series &quot;Pilot One&quot; for CBC Television and became program director of Coast 800.

One notable broadcast was their worldwide period of silence for John Lennon, followed by &quot;Remember&quot; for the recently slain singer. More than 500 radio stations, including one in each Canadian province and American state, plus one in Sydney, Australia played this Dream Network tribute broadcast.

===Format change and listener rebellion===
Late in 1988, management at CFNY ordered a change in format. After nearly 13 years of success and popular acclaim as a freestyle rock and alternative radio station, CFNY switched to a primarily Top 40 format and began to identify on-air as &quot;FM102&quot;. Alternative, which had supported the station for most of its history to that point, was relegated to weekends and late night programming.

This dramatic shift in format would not be without consequences. Most significantly, the change sparked a rebellion in its fan base. The station&#x27;s mid-day phone-in request show was inundated with requests for alternative songs. In support of their new policies and format, station management quickly attempted to put a stop to this by ordering that DJs were to refuse all such calls and fulfill only those requests which were for Top 40 music. Not just unpopular with the station&#x27;s fan base, the new format also resulted in the dismissal or resignation of much of the on-air staff. Perhaps the most notable of these was the resignation of program director Don Berns after only two years in the role, in protest against station management&#x27;s decisions.

In response, the more devoted of the station&#x27;s listeners and fans began signing petitions, even going so far as to file an intervention with the CRTC to oppose the station&#x27;s 1989 licence renewal. Certain radio analyst reports suggested that as many as 100,000 new listeners had been gained by the change, but this masked the fact that the market share dropped considerably, to 4.3%.

===Revival, evolution, and beginning of the Edge===
In the summer of 1989, Selkirk was acquired by Maclean-Hunter, which was committed to returning the station to an alternative format. Instead of reviving the old free-form programming, however, Maclean-Hunter tweaked the station&#x27;s programming to create a more conventional modern rock station. In the same year, &quot;Humble&quot; Howard Glassman and Fred Patterson launched the station&#x27;s new morning show, Humble &amp; Fred, which would go on to receive wide acclaim.

In the early 1990s, the station again became an important outlet for new Canadian music, with bands such as Barenaked Ladies, The Lowest of the Low, Rheostatics, and Sloan counting CFNY as their first major radio supporter. However, alternative rock was the dominant commercial genre by this time, so CFNY did not sound as distinctive compared to other radio stations as it once had.

Unfortunately it would also be some time before the changes were effective in resolving the staff morale problems born during the station&#x27;s recent turbulent years. The most public manifestation of the station&#x27;s morale woes came in 1992, when DJ Dani Elwell resigned from the station by reading her résumé live over the air. 

In June 1992, with the arrival of the new management team of Vince DiMaggio as general manager and Stewart Meyers as program director, sixteen staff were let go in one day. Those included Scot Turner, Don Berns, Kneale Mann (who would return three years later), Jim Duff, and others. 

But the 1990s were also a period of revival and sowing seeds of growth for the station. In addition to the growth of the Humble &amp; Fred morning show, Jason Barr also joined the station at this time and would go on to become a significant contributor to CFNY.

A creation of program director Stewart Meyers, on-air personality Alan Cross launched a new feature on the station in 1993, &quot;The Ongoing History of New Music&quot;. The program chronicled all manner of history and trivia about the roots of rock music in a quasi-documentary style. Over time the feature would come to be one of the most recognizable and long-running shows on the station, being owned by the station until 2008 and continuing to air new segments up until May 2011, when Cross left the station for other opportunities; it was then revived in 2014 after he returned, and continues to air today.

The mid-1990s were another era of transition for CFNY as station owner Maclean-Hunter was acquired by Rogers Communications in 1994. CFNY was sold to competing telecommunications conglomerate Shaw Communications as a result of the acquisition. During this period, the station dropped its old branding and became &quot;102.1 The Edge&quot;. For several years toward the end of the 1990s it was also referred to as &quot;Edge 102&quot; before this was dropped in favour of the current usage. On May 1, 1996, the station finally moved from its old studio in Brampton to a new facility at Yonge-Dundas Square along with a street-level studio at 228 Yonge Street in downtown Toronto.

After only four years of ownership, Shaw Communications chose to spin off its radio holdings to Corus Entertainment in 1999. Corus remains CFNY&#x27;s owner today.

===Corus Entertainment===
After 13 years as CFNY&#x27;s morning show hosts, Howard Glassman and Fred Patterson departed CFNY for CFMJ in April 2001. Taking their place were newcomers Dean Blundell and Todd Shapiro, as well as station regular and Humble &amp; Fred contributor Jason Barr. The new morning show was launched as &quot;The Morning Show with Dean Blundell&quot;, and later renamed &quot;The Dean Blundell Show&quot;. This remained the station&#x27;s morning show until its cancellation in January 2014 broadcasting from 5:30 a.m. until 10 a.m., and was a significant driving force behind many of the station&#x27;s contests and events. Shapiro was fired from the station on July 24, 2013.

Josie Dye joined the station in 2003 as its new mid-day host, on air from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. 2002 also saw Derek Welsman join the station as a commercial producer. Welsman was a member of the Dean Blundell morning show until the show was canceled. In June 2003, assistant program director, music director, and host Kneale Mann left the station to launch CJDV-FM, a new Corus station in Kitchener-Waterloo as program director. He left Corus two years later to launch CILV-FM for Newcap (now Stingray) as program director in Ottawa. Mann left the station in December 2006 and created his own consulting firm MannLeadership, which he managed for 14 years. He then became a managing partner at Kenner Media, and is now an integrated marketing manager for Central Ontario Broadcasting.

Alan Cross, host of &quot;The Ongoing History of New Music&quot;, as well as on-air personality since 1986, departed the station in 2001 to pursue an opportunity as program director at Hamilton-based radio station CJXY-FM for several years. However, in 2004 he returned to the Edge as program director. His tenure as program director for the Edge garnered acclaim for both him and the station, as he was awarded Canadian Program Director of the Year three times—in 2005, 2006, and 2008. Cross returned to the station in 2014 as a programming consultant and to resurrect his popular syndicated show &quot;The Ongoing History of New Music&quot;.

For a number of years in the 2000s, it became rare that the station would announce its call letters. To most, it was simply 102.1 The Edge. Perhaps due to CRTC regulations requiring radio stations to announce their call letters, the station began in August 2005 to identify itself as both CFNY and the Edge during identification breaks. In 2006, however, the station fell afoul of the CRTC. The regulating body opted to give CFNY only a four-year licence renewal, rather than the customary seven. The regulator&#x27;s concerns reportedly involved the station failing once to meet its mandated Canadian content targets.

Further staff shake-ups and alterations came with the close of the 2000s. Program director Alan Cross departed the station once more in 2008 to take a position at Corus Entertainment&#x27;s interactive division, Splice Media. His replacement was former national program director Ross Winters who was fired in July 2013. In May 2009, host Barry Taylor, as well as longtime personality and live-to-air club host Martin Streek were fired for undisclosed reasons. Two months later, Streek took his own life on July 9.

With the departure of Taylor and Streek, host Dave &quot;Bookie&quot; Bookman briefly took over the afternoon drive slot until the Edge hired &quot;Fearless&quot; Fred Kennedy, a host at Edmonton-based CFBR-FM to take over the position. Fred joined the Edge as afternoon drive host in August 2009, while Bookman moved to the weekday evenings time slot.

Just a year later, in August 2010, &quot;Dean Blundell Show&quot; co-host Jason Barr was released from his contract and left the station and formed the &quot;Biggs &amp; Barr&quot; morning show at CHTZ-FM with former Mix 99.9 announcer Chris Biggs. Derek Welsman, former commercial producer and show guest, returned to &quot;The Dean Blundell Show&quot; after a three-year stint at Astral Media as permanent co-host in November of that year.

On September 13, 2010, the Edge left its longtime home studio at 228 Yonge Street for a new studio at the Corus Quay, at 25 Dockside Drive. The new location is adjacent to Sugar Beach, and across the street from the Kool Haus concert venue.

On December 9, 2012, long-time on-air personality and staple Dave Bookman left the station to join the then-upcoming indie station, CIND-FM, making his on-air debut in September 2013. Bookman died on May 21, 2019, after suffering an aneurysm. Indie 88 paid tribute to him with an entire day of programming devoted to their lost colleague. 

====Staffing changes====
In August, 2010 cohost Jason Barr left &quot;The Dean Blundell Show&quot; and CFNY.

On July 24, 2013, it was announced that Todd Shapiro would not be returning to &quot;The Dean Blundell Show&quot;. The exact reasons have not been made public.

In November 2013, the station faced criticism when &quot;Dean Blundell Show&quot; cohost Derek Welsman made on-air comments about a criminal trial on which he had been the jury foreman, resulting in allegations both of homophobia—the case involved allegations of sexual assault against a client of a gay bathhouse—and of potentially causing a mistrial by publicly discussing aspects of the jury deliberations. The station announced the show&#x27;s suspension on December 12, 2013, and the show was ultimately cancelled on January 6, 2014. With the firings of Blundell and Welsman, the station&#x27;s morning show was taken over by &quot;Fearless Fred&quot; Kennedy until March 18, 2014, when former CILQ-FM evening show host Dominik Diamond was announced as the morning show&#x27;s new host.

On March 31, 2014, the station debuted a new weekday schedule. Midday and evening hosts Josie Dye and Greg Beharrell would move to mornings to co-host alongside newcomer Diamond, past host and music programmer Carlos Benevides was re-hired to take over middays, while Fearless Fred returned to the afternoon drive slot joined by weekend host Melani Mariani. Longtime swing host Adam was also granted a permanent timeslot, as evening host.

This lineup, however, would prove short-lived. The departure of both Beharrell to KITS in San Francisco and Benevides back to mornings at CKBT-FM in Kitchener was followed by the apparent dismissal of Diamond, forcing the station to rearrange its broadcast schedule for the third time in less than a year.

In September 2014, Alan Cross rejoined the station as music consultant and host, relaunching &quot;The Ongoing History of New Music&quot; and a new weekday programming feature called &quot;Adventures in Vinyl&quot;. &quot;Spirit of Radio&quot;-era personality Scot Turner, also program director for CJDV-FM and CKBT-FM, rejoined the station as host of &quot;Spirit of Radio Sunday&quot;, a program which focused on classic alternative rock tracks from the &quot;Spirit of Radio&quot; era in the 1980s. The return of Cross and Turner was intended to draw in younger listeners, as well as older audiences from the &quot;Spirit of Radio&quot; era who were alienated by station&#x27;s &quot;harder-edged&quot; atmosphere.

&quot;Spirit of Radio Sunday&quot; became the station&#x27;s highest-rated program, but was discontinued following its February 1, 2015, edition because it was not sufficiently popular among the station&#x27;s core 18–34 demographic. Around this time, the station retired its previous slogan (&quot;Toronto&#x27;s Alternative&quot;) and adopted its current one: &quot;Modern Music&quot;.

In February 2016, the station announced that former MuchMusic VJ and current &quot;ET Canada&quot; correspondent Rick Campanelli will join the station as cohost with Fred and Mel of the morning show, beginning June 27.

In November 2018, Kolter Bouchard (ex-CILQ-FM) and Meredith Geddes (ex-CFOX-FM) were announced as the new afternoon drive show, effective immediately. After Geddes left in April 2023 to return to Vancouver and accept a position at CJAX-FM, she was succeeded by Casey-Jo Loos from Vancouver&#x27;s CFOX-FM as co-host of the afternoon drive show, now called &quot;Kolter &amp; Casey-Jo&quot;. Bouchard left the station at the end of March 2024 to become a full-time online content creator. Loos left Corus in a round of company-wide staffing cuts in February 2025.

In January 2020, Ruby and Alex were released and replaced in February 2020 by the morning show team of Shawna, Chris Z and Jay Brody (known collectively as &quot;The B Team&quot;) from Hamilton sister station CJXY-FM.

In February 2025, the station announced the addition of Justin Wilcomes, also known as Drex, in the afternoon slot effective March 3. &quot;The Drex Show&quot; also airs mornings on CFGQ-FM in Calgary.

==Studios==
Prior to 1996, CFNY studios were located in Brampton. The first location was a house at 2 Ellen Street, then to another house 340 Main Street North and finally to a strip plaza at 83 Kennedy Road South. After 1996 the studio moved to downtown Toronto with two locations on Yonge Street before its current location at Corus Quay.

==Availability and international reach==
102.1 The Edge has long been an international station, as its signal is strong enough that, like many other Toronto radio stations, it is widely available in two of the top fifty media markets in North America. Its signal from Toronto beams from the CN Tower throughout the Buffalo-Niagara Falls New York market, in addition to Toronto.

As a result of these factors, CFNY frequently promotes itself as one of the most listened-to radio stations in the world—the station ranked tenth in a 2002 Arbitron survey of the world&#x27;s most listened-to Internet radio streams.

==Accolades and awards==
CFNY-FM and its staff have been the recipients of numerous awards in the station&#x27;s history.
* The station has been named &quot;Canadian Rock Station of the Year&quot; by the Canadian Music and Broadcast Industry Awards more than two dozen times.
* Former morning show &quot;Humble &amp; Fred&quot; was voted &quot;Best Morning Show in Canada&quot; four times by the Canadian radio industry.
* Former music director and on-air personality Kneale Mann was twice named Canadian Music Director of Year.
* Former program director Stewart Meyers was named Canadian Program Director of the Year three times.
* Former program director Alan Cross was named Canadian Program Director of the Year three times.
* Afternoon drive host &quot;Fearless&quot; Fred Kennedy won the inaugural 2009 Steve Young Award, recognizing rising Canadian radio stars under the age of 30
* &quot;The Dean Blundell Show&quot; was awarded 2011&#x27;s &quot;Top Radio Program (Morning Show)&quot; award by Top Choice Awards

==Contests, events and features==
===CASBY Music Awards===

In 1981, on the program director David Marsden&#x27;s initiative, CFNY launched the annual U-Know Awards (U-Knows) as a way of recognizing Canadian alternative musical acts ignored by the Top-40 focused mainstream Juno Awards. Following a listener contest in 1986, the ceremony was renamed the CASBY Awards - an acronym for Canadian Artists Selected By You (originally, Chosen As Selected By You). The event, presenting awards to Canadian musicians who have won the most votes from listeners, was held every year until 1996.

The CASBY Awards were then revived in 2002 and held annually until being discontinued following the 2017 edition.

===Edgefest===

Began in 1987 and founded by CFNY-FM staffers Kneale Mann, Earl Veale, and Phil Evans as a thank-you gesture to the listeners and as a birthday party to commemorate both the station&#x27;s tenth birthday and Canada Day. Since then, it has spanned 30 years, more than 300 bands, over 500,000 attendees, and five locations; Molson Park in Barrie, Ontario, the Ontario Place Forum, the Molson Amphitheatre, Downsview Park, and most recently at TD Echo Beach. It was the longest running rock festival in Canada.

===Edge Free Money===
Edge Free Money, originally known as Free Money Month, is a call-in contest run by the station. Every day for a given period of time, a band is selected as the Edge Artist of the Day. The first time that this artist is played on-air, listeners may begin calling in. The 102nd caller to get through wins $1000 from the station. In 2011, Free Money Month actually spanned three months: September, October, and November.

===Jingle Bell Rock===
Since 1998, the Edge has run an annual concert series in December of each year. From 1998 to 2008, it was known as the Edge Electric Christmas. Starting in 2009, it began to be billed as Jingle Bell Rock. It is a series of several concerts which are generally in smaller concert venues, although playing in large venues is not unheard-of. A percentage of proceeds from ticket sales are donated to the Daily Bread Food Bank.

===Rock of Fame===
The station launched its own hall of fame for notable musicians in summer 2011. This initiative is now defunct as it relied on Dave &quot;Bookie&quot; Bookman&#x27;s presence in the radio and music industries. 
*Foo Fighters (inducted August 9, 2011)
*Coldplay (inducted September 21, 2011)
*Red Hot Chili Peppers (inducted April 28, 2012)
*The Offspring (inducted September 2, 2012)
*The Tragically Hip (inducted November 1, 2012)

===Sausagefest===
A yearly event which had been held since the start of the &quot;Dean Blundell Show&quot;, Sausagefest was a summertime backyard barbecue-style event which was typically held at the Sound Academy venue and emceed by the hosts of the show. It featured artists and bands (different each year) performing on the stage inside, while drinks and barbecued food were sold outside. The final Sausagefest was held in the summer of 2012.

<doc id="164676" wikidata="Q158252" url="?curid=164676" title="Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia">
<text>Elizabeth Stuart (19 August 1596 – 13 February 1662) was Electress of the Palatinate and briefly Queen of Bohemia as the wife of Frederick V of the Palatinate. The couple&#x27;s selection for the crown by the nobles of Bohemia was part of the political and religious turmoil that set off the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Since her husband&#x27;s reign in Bohemia lasted over only one winter, she is called &quot;the Winter Queen&quot; (, ).

Princess Elizabeth was the only surviving daughter of James VI and I, King of Scotland, England, and Ireland, and his queen, Anne of Denmark; she was the elder sister of Charles I. Born in Scotland, she was named in honour of her father&#x27;s predecessor and cousin in England, Elizabeth I. During Elizabeth Stuart&#x27;s childhood, unbeknownst to her, part of the failed Gunpowder Plot was a scheme to replace her father with her on the throne, and forcibly raise her as a Catholic.

Her father later arranged for her marriage to the Protestant Frederick V, a senior prince of the Holy Roman Empire. They were married in the Chapel Royal in the Palace of Whitehall, and then left for his lands in Germany. Their marriage proved successful, but after they left Bohemia, they spent years in exile in The Hague, while the Thirty Years&#x27; War continued. In her widowhood, she eventually returned to England at the end of her own life during the Stuart Restoration of her nephew and is buried in Westminster Abbey.

With the demise in 1714 of Elizabeth&#x27;s great-niece, Anne, Queen of Great Britain, the last Stuart monarch, the British throne passed to her grandson (by her daughter Sophia of Hanover) as George I, initiating the rule of the House of Hanover.

==Early life==

Elizabeth was born at Dunfermline Palace, Fife, on 19 August 1596 at 2 o&#x27;clock in the morning. King James rode to the bedside from Callendar, where he was attending the wedding of the Earl of Orkney. At the time of her birth, her father was King of Scotland, but not yet King of England. Named in honour of Elizabeth I of England, her godmother, the young Elizabeth was christened on 28 November 1596 in the Chapel Royal at Holyroodhouse, and was then proclaimed by the heralds as &quot;Lady Elizabeth&quot;. During her early life in Scotland, Elizabeth was brought up at Linlithgow Palace, where she was placed in the care of Lord Livingstone and his wife, Eleanor Hay. A couple of years later the king&#x27;s second daughter, Margaret, was placed in their care as well. Elizabeth &quot;did not pay particular attention to this younger sister&quot;, as even at this young age her affections were with her brother, Henry.

===Move to England===
When Queen Elizabeth I of England died in 1603, Elizabeth Stuart&#x27;s father, James, succeeded as King of England and Ireland. The Countess of Kildare was appointed the princess&#x27;s governess. Along with her elder brother, Henry, Elizabeth made the journey southward to England with her mother &quot;in a triumphal progress of perpetual entertainment&quot;. On her father&#x27;s birthday, 19 June, Elizabeth danced at Worksop Manor with Robert Cecil&#x27;s son.

Elizabeth remained at court for a few weeks, but &quot;there is no evidence that she was present at her parents&#x27; coronation&quot; on 25 July 1603. It seems likely that by this time the royal children already had been removed to Oatlands, an old Tudor hunting lodge near Weybridge. There was plague in London, and Prince Henry and Princess Elizabeth were moved to Winchester. Her mother, Anne of Denmark, produced a masque to welcome them. On 19 October 1603 &quot;an order was issued under the privy seal announcing that the King had thought fit to commit the keeping and education of the Lady Elizabeth to the Lord Harrington and his wife&quot;.

Under the care of Lord and Lady Harington at Coombe Abbey, Elizabeth met Anne Dudley, with whom she was to strike up a lifelong friendship. On 3 April 1604, Princess Elizabeth and her ladies rode from Coombe Abbey to Coventry. The Mayor and Aldermen met her at &quot;Jabet&#x27;s Ash on Stoke-green&quot;. She heard a sermon in St Michael&#x27;s Church and dined in St Mary&#x27;s Hall.

===Gunpowder Plot===

Part of the intent of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was to assassinate Elizabeth&#x27;s father King James and the Protestant aristocracy, kidnap the nine-year-old Elizabeth from Coombe Abbey, and place her on the throne of England – and presumably the thrones of Ireland and Scotland – as a Catholic monarch. The conspirators chose Elizabeth after considering the other available options. Prince Henry, it was believed, would perish alongside his father. Charles was seen as too feeble (having only just learnt to walk) and Mary too young. Elizabeth, on the other hand, had already attended formal functions, and the conspirators knew that &quot;she could fulfil a ceremonial role despite her comparative youth&quot;.

The conspirators aimed to cause an uprising in the Midlands to coincide with the explosion in London and at this point secure Elizabeth&#x27;s accession as a puppet queen. She would then be brought up as a Catholic and later married to a Catholic bridegroom. The plot failed when the conspirators were betrayed, and Guy Fawkes was caught by the King&#x27;s soldiers before he was able to ignite the powder.

===Education===

Elizabeth was given a comprehensive education for a princess at that time. This education included instruction in natural history, geography, theology, languages, writing, music, and dancing. She was denied instruction in the classics as her father believed that &quot;Latin had the unfortunate effect of making women more cunning&quot;. By the age of 12, Elizabeth was fluent in several languages, including French, &quot;which she spoke with ease and grace&quot; and would later use to converse with her husband. She was also an excellent rider, had a thorough understanding of the Protestant religion, and had an aptitude for writing letters that &quot;sounded sincere and never stilted&quot;. She also was extremely literary, and &quot;several mementoes of her early love of books exist&quot;.

==Courtship and marriage==

===Suitors===
As the daughter of a reigning monarch, the hand of the young Elizabeth was seen as a very desirable prize. Suitors came from across the continent and were many and varied. They included:
* Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, son (and later successor) of the King of Sweden
* Frederic Ulric, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel
* Prince Maurice of Nassau
* Theophilus Howard, Lord Howard of Walden, later second Earl of Suffolk
* Otto, Hereditary Prince of Hesse-Kassel, son of Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel
* Victor Amadeus, Prince of Piedmont, the King of Spain&#x27;s nephew and heir to the Duke of Savoy
* Philip III of Spain, newly widowed in 1611.
Each suitor brought to the proposed marriage the prospect of power and greatness for the young Elizabeth.

Marriage could be of great benefit to her father&#x27;s kingdom. When James had succeeded to the English throne in 1603, England had acquired a new role in European affairs. James, unlike the childless Elizabeth I, by simply &quot;having children, could play an important role in dynastic politics&quot;. The selection of Elizabeth&#x27;s spouse, therefore, had little to do with her personal preference and a great deal to do with the benefits the match could bring.

Most of her suitors were rejected quickly for a variety of reasons. Some simply were not of high enough birth, had no real prospects to offer, or in the case of Gustavus Adolphus, who on all other grounds seemed like a perfect match, because &quot;his country was at war with Queen Anne&#x27;s native Denmark&quot;. Furthermore, England could not face another religious revolution, and therefore the religious pre-requisite was paramount.
The man chosen was Frederick (Friedrich) V, Count Palatine of the Rhine. Frederick was of undeniably high lineage. His ancestors included the kings of Aragon and Sicily, the landgraves of Hesse, the dukes of Brabant and Saxony, and the counts of Nassau and Leuven. He and Elizabeth also shared a common ancestor in Henry II of England. He was &quot;a senior Prince of the Empire&quot; and a staunch defender of the Protestant faith.

===Courtship===
Frederick arrived in England on 16 October 1612, and the match seemed to please them both from the beginning. Their contemporaries noted how Frederick seemed to &quot;delight in nothing but her company and conversation&quot;. Frederick also struck up a friendship with Elizabeth&#x27;s elder brother, Prince Henry, which delighted his prospective bride immensely. King James did not take into consideration the couple&#x27;s happiness, but saw the match as &quot;one step in a larger process of achieving domestic and European concord&quot;. The only person seemingly unhappy with the match was Queen Anne. As the daughter of a king, the sister of a king, the wife of a king, and the mother of a future king, she also desired to be the mother of a queen. She is said to have been somewhat fond of Frederick&#x27;s mild manner and generous nature but simply felt that he was of low stock.

On 6 November 1612, Henry, Prince of Wales, died. His death took an emotional toll on Elizabeth, and her new position as second-in-line to the throne made her an even more desirable match. Queen Anne and those like-minded who had &quot;always considered the Palsgrave to be an unworthy match for her, were emboldened in their opposition&quot;. Elizabeth stood by Frederick, whom her brother had approved, and whom she found to have the sentiments of a fine gentleman. Above all, he was &quot;regarded as the future head of the Protestant interest in Germany&quot;.

===Marriage to Frederick V===

The wedding took place on 14 February 1613 at the royal chapel at the Palace of Whitehall and was a grand occasion that saw more royalty than ever visit the court of England. The marriage was an enormously popular match and was the occasion for an outpouring of public affection with the ceremony described as &quot;a wonder of ceremonial and magnificence even for that extravagant age&quot;.

It was celebrated with lavish and sophisticated festivities both in London and Heidelberg, including mass feasts and lavish furnishings that cost nearly £50,000, and nearly bankrupted King James. Among many celebratory writings of the events was John Donne&#x27;s &quot;Epithalamion, Or Marriage Song on the Lady Elizabeth, and Count Palatine being married on St Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;. A contemporary author viewed the whole marriage as a prestigious event that saw England &quot;lend her rarest gem, to enrich the Rhine&quot;.

==Electress Palatine==
After almost a two-month stay in London for continued celebrations, the couple began their journey to join the Electoral court in Heidelberg. The journey was filled with meeting people, sampling foods and wines, and being entertained by a wide variety of performers and companies. At each place the young couple stopped, Elizabeth was expected to distribute presents. The cash to allow her to do so was not readily available, so she had to use one of her own jewels as collateral so that the goldsmith Abraham Harderet would &quot;provide her with suitable presents on credit&quot;.

Her arrival in Heidelberg was seen as &quot;the crowning achievement of a policy which tried to give the Palatinate a central place in international politics&quot; and was long anticipated and welcomed. Elizabeth&#x27;s new husband transformed his seat at Heidelberg Castle, creating between 1610 and 1613 the &quot;Englischer Bau&quot; (i.e., English Building) for her, a monkey-house, a menagerie, and the beginnings of a new garden in the Italian Renaissance garden style popular in England at the time. The garden, the &quot;Hortus Palatinus&quot;, was constructed by Elizabeth&#x27;s former tutor, Salomon de Caus. It was dubbed the &quot;Eighth Wonder of the World&quot; by contemporaries.

Although Elizabeth and Frederick were considered to be genuinely in love and remained a romantic couple throughout the course of their marriage, problems already had begun to arise. Before the couple had left England, King James had made Frederick promise that Elizabeth &quot;would take precedence over his mother ... and always be treated as if she were a Queen&quot;. This at times made life in the Palatinate uncomfortable for Elizabeth, for Frederick&#x27;s mother Louise Juliana had &quot;not expected to be demoted in favour of her young daughter-in-law&quot; and, as such, their relationship was never more than civil.

Elizabeth gave birth to three children in Heidelberg: Frederick Henry, Hereditary Prince of the Palatinate (sometimes called Henry Frederick) was born in 1614, Charles in 1617, and Elisabeth in 1619.

==Queen of Bohemia==
In 1619 Elizabeth&#x27;s husband Frederick was one of those offered the throne of Bohemia.

The Kingdom of Bohemia was &quot;an aristocratic republic in all but name&quot;, whose nobles elected the monarch. It was one of the few successful pluralist states. The country had enjoyed a long period of religious freedom, but in March 1619, on the death of Emperor Matthias, this seemed about to change. The Habsburg heir, Archduke Ferdinand, crowned King of Bohemia in 1617, was a fervent Catholic who brutally persecuted Protestants in his Duchy of Styria. The Bohemian nobles had to choose between &quot;either accepting Ferdinand as their king after all or taking the ultimate step of deposing him&quot;. They decided on deposition, and, when others declined because of the risks involved, the Bohemians &quot;pandered to the elector&#x27;s royalist pretensions&quot; and extended the invitation to Elizabeth&#x27;s husband.

Frederick, although doubtful, was persuaded to accept. Elizabeth &quot;appealed to his honour as a prince and a cavalier, and to his humanity as a Christian&quot;, aligning herself with him completely. The family moved to Prague, where &quot;the new King was received with genuine joy&quot;. Frederick was crowned officially in the St. Vitus Cathedral at the Prague Castle on 4 November 1619. The coronation of Elizabeth as Queen of Bohemia followed three days later.

The royal couple&#x27;s third son, Prince Rupert, was born in Prague one month after the coronation. There was great popular rejoicing. Thus, Frederick&#x27;s reign in Bohemia had begun well, but only lasted one year. The Bohemian crown &quot;had always been a corner-stone of Habsburg policy&quot; and the heir, Ferdinand, now Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II, would not yield. Frederick&#x27;s reign ended with the defeat of Bohemian Protestant armies at the Battle of White Mountain (which ended the first phase of the Thirty Years&#x27; War) on 8 November 1620.

Elizabeth is remembered as the &quot;Winter Queen&quot;, and Frederick as the &quot;Winter King&quot;, in reference to the brevity of their reign, and to the season of the battle.

==Exile==
Fearing the worst, by the time of the defeat at the Battle of White Mountain, Elizabeth already had left Prague and was awaiting the birth of her fifth child at the Castle of Custrin, about from Berlin. It was there on 6 January 1621 that she &quot;in an easy labour lasting little more than an hour&quot; was delivered of a healthy son, Maurice.

The military defeat removed the prospect of returning to Prague, and the entire family was forced to flee. They could no longer return to the Palatinate as it was occupied by the Catholic league and a Spanish contingent. Hence, after an invitation from the Prince of Orange, they moved to The Hague.

Elizabeth arrived in The Hague in spring 1621 with only a small court. Her sense of duty to assist her husband out of the political mess in which they had found themselves meant that &quot;she became much more an equal, if not the stronger, partner in the marriage&quot;. Her lady-in-waiting, Amalia van Solms, soon became involved with Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, and married him in 1625. The two women became rivals at the court of The Hague.

While in exile Elizabeth produced eight more children, four boys and four girls. The last, Gustavus, was born on 2 January 1632 and baptised in the Cloister Church where two of his siblings who had died young, Louis and Charlotte, were buried. Later that same month, Frederick said farewell to Elizabeth and set out on a journey to join the king of Sweden on the battlefield. After declining conditions set out by King Gustavus Adolphus that would have seen the Swedish king assist in his restoration, the pair parted with Frederick heading back toward The Hague. He had been ill with an infection since the beginning of October 1632, and died on the morning of 29 November before reaching The Hague.

==Widowhood==
When Elizabeth received the news of Frederick&#x27;s death, she became senseless with grief and for three days did not eat, drink, or sleep. When Charles I heard of Elizabeth&#x27;s state, he invited her to return to England, but she refused. The rights of her son and Frederick&#x27;s heir Charles Louis &quot;remained to be fought for&quot;. Elizabeth then fought for her son&#x27;s rights, but she remained in The Hague even after he regained the Electorate of the Palatinate in 1648. She became a patron of the arts, and commissioned a larger family portrait to honour herself and her husband, to complement the impressive large seascape of her 1613 joyous entry to the Netherlands. Her memorial family portrait of 1636 was outdone by Amalia van Solms, who commissioned the Oranjezaal after the death of her husband Frederick Henry in 1648–1651.

Elizabeth filled her time with copious letter writing and making marriage matches for her children. Between Frederick&#x27;s death in 1632 and her own 30 years later, she witnessed the deaths of four more of her ten surviving children: Gustavus in 1641, Philip in 1650, Henriette Marie in 1651, and Maurice in 1652. Her brother Charles I, King of England was executed in early 1649, and the surviving Stuart family was exiled during the years of the Commonwealth. The relationships with her remaining living children also became somewhat estranged, although she did spend time with her growing number of grandchildren. She began to pay the price for having been &quot;a distant mother to most of her own children&quot;, and the idea of going to England now was uppermost in her thoughts.

==Death==

In 1660, the Stuarts were restored to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland in the person of Elizabeth&#x27;s nephew Charles II. Elizabeth arrived in England on 26 May 1661. By July, she was no longer planning on returning to The Hague and made plans for the remainder of her furniture, clothing, and other property to be sent to her. She then proceeded to move to Drury House, where she established a small, but impressive and welcoming, household. On 29 January 1662 she made another move, to Leicester House, Westminster, but by this time she was quite ill. Elizabeth caught pneumonia, bled from her lungs on 10 February 1662 and died soon after midnight on 13 February.

Her death caused little public stir as by then her &quot;chief, if not only, claim to fame [in London] was as the mother of Rupert of the Rhine, the legendary Cavalier general&quot;. On the evening of 17 February, when her coffin (into which her remains had been placed the previous day) left Somerset House, Rupert was the only one of her sons to follow the funeral procession to Westminster Abbey. There in the chapel of Henry VII, &quot;a survivor of an earlier age, isolated and without a country she could really call her own&quot;, she was laid to rest among her ancestors and close to her beloved elder brother, Henry, Prince of Wales, in the Mary, Queen of Scots vault.

==Issue==
Elizabeth and Frederick had 13 children, six of whom outlived their mother:

# Henry Frederick, Hereditary Prince of the Palatinate (1614–1629); drowned
# Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine (1617–1680); married Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel, had issue including Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine, Duchess of Orleans; married Marie Luise von Degenfeld, had issue; married again Elisabeth Holländer von Berau (1659-1702), had issue
# Elisabeth of the Palatinate (1618–1680)
# Rupert, Count Palatine of the Rhine (1619–1682); had two illegitimate children
# Maurice of the Palatinate (16 January 1621 – 1 September 1652)
# Louise Hollandine of the Palatinate (18 April 162211 February 1709)
# Louis (21 August 162424 December 1624)
# Edward, Count Palatine of Simmern (1625–1663); married Anne Gonzaga, had issue
# Henriette Marie of the Palatinate (7 July 162618 September 1651); married Prince Sigismund Rákóczi, brother of George II Rákóczi, Prince of Transylvania, on 16 June 1651
# John Philip Frederick of the Palatinate (26 September 162716 February 1650); also reported to have been born on 15 September 1629 
# Charlotte of the Palatinate (19 December 162814 January 1631)
# Sophia, Electress of Hanover (14 October 16308 June 1714); married Ernest Augustus, Elector of Hanover, had issue, including King George I of Great Britain. Many other royal families are Sophia&#x27;s, and therefore, Elizabeth&#x27;s, descendants. Sophia came close to ascending to the British throne, but died two months before Queen Anne.
# Gustavus Adolphus of the Palatinate (14 January 16321641)

==Ancestry and family tree ==

==Legacy==
Under the English Act of Settlement 1701, the succession to the English and Scottish crowns (later British crown) was settled on Elizabeth&#x27;s youngest daughter Sophia of Hanover and her issue. In August 1714, Sophia&#x27;s son (Elizabeth&#x27;s grandson) George I ascended to the throne, with the future Royal family all his descendants and hence, also descendants of Elizabeth.

The Elizabeth River in colonial Southeastern Virginia was named in honour of the princess, as was Cape Elizabeth, a peninsula (and today a town) in the United States in the state of Maine. John Smith explored and mapped New England and gave names to places mainly based on the names used by Native Americans. When Smith presented his map to Charles I, he suggested that the king should feel free to change the &quot;barbarous names&quot; for &quot;English&quot; ones. The king made many such changes, but only four survive today, one of which is Cape Elizabeth.

According to legend, William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven, built Ashdown House in Berkshire, England, in honour of Elizabeth, although she died before the house was completed.

<text>Barnim () is a district in Brandenburg, Germany. It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) Poland, the district of Märkisch-Oderland, the city state of Berlin and the districts of Oberhavel and Uckermark.

== History ==
The name &quot;Barnim&quot; emerged in the 13th century and was applied to a large forest region east of the Havel and north of the Spree on the homonymous plateau, where noblemen used to hunt. The present district is roughly identical with, but somewhat smaller than this historical region.

The district was established in 1993 by merging the former districts of Bernau and Eberswalde.

== Geography ==
Barnim extends from the Oder River to the outskirts of Berlin. The Oder River forms the eastern border. From here the Oder Havel Canal (connecting Oder and Havel) and the historical Finow Canal lead westwards to Eberswalde and beyond. The portions north of these artificial waterways are called Schorfheide. This is a forest region with several large lakes, e.g. Werbellinsee (8 km2), Grimnitzsee (8 km2) and Parsteiner See (10 km2). The Schorfheide is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and houses several rare animals like the white-tailed eagle, greater spotted eagle, osprey, black stork, European beaver and Eurasian otter.

== Demography ==


== Coat of arms ==

The coat of arms of the district resembles the coat of arms of the former district Oberbarnim. The only difference is that the old one had a silver top half and a red bottom half, while the current one is split into four parts and in the right half exchanged red and silver. The eagle in the top half is the eagle of Brandenburg.

<doc id="164678" wikidata="Q647370" url="?curid=164678" title="Mercyful Fate">
<text>Mercyful Fate is a Danish heavy metal band from Copenhagen, formed in 1981 by vocalist King Diamond and guitarist Hank Shermann. Influenced by progressive rock and hard rock, and with lyrics dealing with LaVeyan Satanism (often with ironic or sardonic use of Christian themes) and the occult, Mercyful Fate was part of the first wave of black metal in the early to mid-1980s, along with Venom and Bathory. The band is also cited as a formative influence on many then-up-and-coming subgenres of heavy metal, including thrash metal and death metal, as well as the Norwegian black metal scene.

Since its inception in 1981, Mercyful Fate has released seven studio albums, two extended plays, and four compilations. After several line-up changes and self-made demos, they released their self-titled EP in 1982, with the line-up of King Diamond (vocals), Hank Shermann (lead and rhythm guitars), Michael Denner (rhythm and lead guitars), Timi Hansen (bass) and Kim Ruzz (drums). With this line-up, the group recorded their first two studio albums: 1983&#x27;s &quot;Melissa&quot; and 1984&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Break the Oath&quot;. In spite of their reputation as one of the most acclaimed bands of the European heavy metal scene of the 1980s, Mercyful Fate were the subject of controversy due to their satanic imagery, and one of their songs &quot;Into the Coven&quot; (from &quot;Melissa&quot;) later gained notoriety for appearing as one of the PMRC&#x27;s &quot;Filthy Fifteen&quot; list of objectionable songs.

After disbanding in 1985 due to musical differences, four out of the five members of Mercyful Fate reunited in 1992 and recorded the album &quot;In the Shadows&quot;, which was released the following year. During the 1990s, the band released four more studio albums and went through several line-up changes. Mercyful Fate went on hiatus in 1999, but had reunited on occasion during the 2000s. On August 1, 2019, it was announced that Mercyful Fate was reuniting on a more permanent basis, with plans to tour and release a new album, which will be their first since &quot;9&quot; in 1999.

==History==
===Formation and first releases (1981–1985)===
Mercyful Fate was originally formed in Copenhagen in the spring of 1981, following the dissolution of the band Brats. Brats were a punk/metal band, featuring future Mercyful Fate members, vocalist King Diamond, and guitarists Hank Shermann and Michael Denner. After two studio albums and several line-up changes (including the addition of Diamond and the departure of Denner), Diamond and Shermann began writing new material that was much heavier than any of Brats&#x27; previous work. The band&#x27;s record label CBS was not pleased with the material, and demanded they stop singing in English and become more commercial. As a result, Diamond and Shermann quit the group and went on to form Mercyful Fate. Former Rock Nalle bassist Ole Beich (later of L.A. Guns and Guns N&#x27; Roses) briefly joined the band around this time. After several line-up changes and semi-professional demo tapes, Mercyful Fate released their self-titled EP in 1982. This line-up, consisting of King Diamond, Hank Shermann, bassist Timi Hansen, drummer Kim Ruzz and guitarist Michael Denner. 

In July 1983, Mercyful Fate recorded their debut album at Easy Sound Recording, in Copenhagen, Denmark. Entitled &quot;Melissa&quot;, the album was produced by Henrik Lund and released on October 30, 1983 through Roadrunner Records. &quot;Melissa&quot; has been referred to as &quot;one of the first records to start to develop an &#x27;extreme metal&#x27; sound&quot; and was major influence on the then-emerging thrash metal, death metal and black metal genres. The character of Melissa, a witch who was burned at the stake, appears for the first time on the eponymous debut album and intermittently throughout the band&#x27;s later work. One of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Into the Coven&quot;, received particular attention two years later, when it was listed by the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) as one of their &quot;Filthy Fifteen&quot; songs due to its perceived occult content. King Diamond was, in reality, interested in LaVeyan Satanism, which he called &quot;a life philosophy&quot; and stated that it had nothing to do with the Devil of Abrahamic religions. After a number of concerts around Denmark, Mercyful Fate entered the studio in May 1984 to record their second studio album &quot;Don&#x27;t Break the Oath&quot;, which was released on September 7, 1984. During the album&#x27;s supporting tour, the band played the US for two months and made festival appearances in Germany. Despite winning a cult following around the world, Mercyful Fate broke up in April 1985, due to musical differences. Guitarist Hank Shermann wanted the band to move to a more commercial sound; King Diamond refused and announced his departure from Mercyful Fate, which led to the band breaking up.

===After disbanding (1985–1992)===
After Mercyful Fate broke up in 1985, King Diamond, along with Michael Denner and Timi Hansen, formed the eponymous King Diamond band. Both Denner and Hansen stayed with the group until 1987&#x27;s &quot;Abigail&quot;, after which both left King Diamond. They were replaced by Mike Moon and Hal Patino, respectively, and King Diamond continued releasing albums even after Mercyful Fate had reformed. After leaving King Diamond, Michael Denner opened up a recordshop in Copenhagen, until 1988, when he formed the band Lavina (which would later become Zoser Mez), along with former bandmate Hank Shermann. Hank Shermann had formed the hard rock band Fate in 1985, after having left Mercyful Fate. With Fate, Shermann released two albums: 1985&#x27;s &quot;Fate&quot; and 1986&#x27;s &quot;A Matter of Attitude&quot;. After leaving the band, Shermann joined-up with Michael Denner to form Lavina.

During the time Mercyful Fate were disbanded, Roadrunner Records released three Mercyful Fate compilation albums. &quot;The Beginning&quot; was released on June 24, 1987, and featured material from the band&#x27;s 1982 self-titled EP, as well as rare live and studio recordings. On May 12, 1992, &quot;Return of the Vampire&quot; was released, which was another compilation of rare studio recordings. On October 6, 1992, Roadrunner Records released &quot;A Dangerous Meeting&quot;, a greatest hits album under the King Diamond name, featuring material from both Mercyful Fate and King Diamond.

===Reunion (1992–1999)===
In 1992, King Diamond, Hank Shermann, Michael Denner and Timi Hansen reunited to reform Mercyful Fate (drummer Kim Ruzz was replaced by Morten Nielsen). The result was the band&#x27;s third album &quot;In the Shadows&quot;, which was released on June 22, 1993 through Metal Blade Records. The album also featured a guest appearance by Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich (a fellow Dane) on the track &quot;Return of the Vampire&quot;. For the album&#x27;s supporting tour, Morten Nielsen was replaced by King Diamond drummer Snowy Shaw, due to a knee injury Nielsen had sustained. Bassist Timi Hansen was also replaced by Sharlee D&#x27;Angelo, as Hansen did not want to take part in touring. On June 27, 1994, the band released &quot;The Bell Witch&quot;, an EP of live tracks, as well as studio recordings from &quot;In the Shadows&quot;.
On October 25, 1994, Mercyful Fate released its fourth album &quot;Time&quot;, which was recorded and mixed at the Dallas Sound Lab during May and August of that year. After the album&#x27;s release, drummer Snowy Shaw was replaced by Bjarne T. Holm for the Time Tour. Holm had originally been asked to join Mercyful Fate back in 1981, but had declined due to prior commitments. The band spent January through February 1996 recording and mixing their next album &quot;Into the Unknown&quot;, which was released on August 20, 1996. After the album&#x27;s release, guitarist Michael Denner left the band and was replaced by Mike Wead. In October 1997, Mercyful Fate began recording its sixth album &quot;Dead Again&quot; at the Nomad Recording Studio in Carrollton, Texas. &quot;Dead Again&quot; was released on June 9, 1998. In February 1999, Mercyful Fate began recording its seventh studio album &quot;9&quot;, which was released on June 15, 1999.

===Hiatus and sporadic reunions (1999–2018)===
After the supporting tour for &quot;9&quot;, Mercyful Fate was put on hiatus. King Diamond focused on his eponymous band, along with guitarist Mike Wead, who joined the group during the European &quot;House of God&quot; tour. Hank Shermann and Bjarne T. Holm reunited with Michael Denner to form Force of Evil, while Sharlee D&#x27;Angelo joined the band Arch Enemy. When asked about the current state of the band in 2008, Diamond stated that Mercyful Fate is currently &quot;hibernating&quot;, and that &quot;it&#x27;s definitely not finished, at least in my book.&quot; In August 2008, King Diamond was asked by Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich if Mercyful Fate would be willing to participate in Activision&#x27;s &quot;Guitar Hero: Metallica&quot; video game. Ulrich requested the original masters for two of the band&#x27;s songs, so they could be used in the game. Unable to locate them, Diamond suggested to Activision the band re-record the songs, and as a result, King Diamond, Hank Shermann, Michael Denner, Timi Hansen and Bjarne T. Holm reunited to re-record the songs &quot;Evil&quot; and &quot;Curse of the Pharaohs&quot;. King Diamond was also made into a playable character in the game.

On December 7, 2011, King Diamond, Hank Shermann, Michael Denner and Timi Hansen reunited onstage at Metallica&#x27;s 30th Anniversary concert, at the Fillmore in San Francisco, California, where they, alongside Metallica, performed the latter&#x27;s &quot;Mercyful Fate&quot; medley from &quot;Garage Inc.&quot;

On January 28, 2017, the original line-up of Mercyful Fate (minus Diamond) reunited to receive the Pioneer Prize at the Steppeulven ceremony by the Danish Association of Music Critics at the Bremen Teater in Copenhagen. This was the first time drummer Ruzz appeared with the band since the 1985 split.

===Full-time reunion (2019–present)===

On August 1, 2019, it was announced that Mercyful Fate would be performing an unspecified number of concerts throughout Europe in the summer of 2020. The band&#x27;s line-up consists of King Diamond on vocals, Hank Shermann on guitar, Bjarne T. Holm on drums, Mike Wead on guitar and Joey Vera on bass, the latter of whom was filling in for Timi Hansen, who was battling cancer; Vera then became their full-time bass player after Hansen died on November 4, 2019, shortly after his 61st birthday. Aside from previously released material, the band was also going to perform new songs over the course of the summer.

In a May 2020 interview with Heavy magazine, Shermann said that he had &quot;written six or seven songs&quot; for the band&#x27;s new album. On June 2, 2022, Mercyful Fate performed their first live show since 1999 in Hanover as part of a European tour, where they debuted a brand new song titled &quot;The Jackal of Salzburg&quot;.

On January 16, 2024, Mercyful Fate announced that they had &quot;mutually decided to split ways&quot; with Vera. Three days later, it was announced Becky Baldwin was the new bassist of the band, who filled in for Vera during the band&#x27;s 2022 tour. In the following month, Baldwin stated that the new Mercyful Fate album is not expected to be released before 2025, due to King Diamond&#x27;s focus on his namesake band&#x27;s upcoming thirteenth studio album &quot;The Institute&quot;.

==Style and legacy==
Mercyful Fate were a part of the first wave of black metal, along with other groups, such as Venom, Bathory, and Hellhammer. Many of these groups helped establish the style upon which future black metal artists would later build. Unlike the other first-wave bands, typical elements of Mercyful Fate&#x27;s style are influences from progressive rock, epic 1970s hard rock, and traditional heavy metal. As many of the band&#x27;s songs featured lyrics about Satanism and the occult and King Diamond was among the first black metal musicians to use the now famous corpse paint, Mercyful Fate was a pioneer in developing black metal, although their musical style was not as much an influence as that of other first wave bands. The band has also been cited as an influence on or inspiration to bands of the then-emerging death metal genre, including Death, Morbid Angel, Obituary and Cannibal Corpse.

Mercyful Fate have been cited as a formative influence on the 1980s thrash metal scene, including two-fourths of the genre&#x27;s &quot;Big Four&quot; – Metallica and Slayer. Other thrash metal bands that have cited the band as an influence or inspiration to them include Testament, Exodus and Kreator. Slayer guitarist Kerry King has stated that he and then-guitarist Jeff Hanneman were big fans of Mercyful Fate and cited them as influence on their second album &quot;Hell Awaits&quot;. Metallica recorded a medley of Mercyful Fate songs on their 1998 covers album &quot;Garage Inc.&quot;. Since then, the band has performed the song various times live with several members of Mercyful Fate. Lars Ulrich from Metallica has said in about 2008: &quot;Mercyful Fate has made two of the best heavy rock records ever. We have been friends with them for 23 years. The first time I ever played on some other record was with them – I was in Dallas to make &quot;Return of the Vampire&quot; in 1992. They have been a very, very big inspiration for our sound.&quot;

<text>Roy Oliver Disney ( ; June 24, 1893 – December 20, 1971) was an American entertainment executive who co-founded the Walt Disney Company with his younger brother, Walt Disney. He also served as the company&#x27;s first CEO and was the father of Roy E. Disney.

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Disney was born to Irish-Canadian Elias Charles Disney and English-German-American Flora Call Disney in Chicago, Illinois, on June 24, 1893. The family moved to Marceline, Missouri, and to Kansas City in 1911. 

On July 1, 1911, Elias purchased a newspaper delivery route for &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot;. It extended from 27th Street to the 31st Street and from Prospect Avenue to Indiana Avenue. Roy and his brother Walt worked as newspaper delivery boys. The family delivered the morning newspaper, &quot;The Kansas City Times,&quot; to approximately 700 customers and &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; to more than 600. The number of customers served increased with time.

Disney graduated from the Manual Training High School of Kansas City in 1912. He left the paper delivery route and worked on a farm in the summer. He was then employed as a bank clerk along with brother Raymond Arnold Disney at the First National Bank of Kansas City. 

Disney served in the United States Navy from 1917 to 1919. He military career was cut short by a contraction of tuberculosis during his service and Disney was honorably discharged from military duty.

While convalescing from a recurrence of tuberculosis at the Sawtelle Veterans Home in Los Angeles in October of 1923, his brother Walt came to visit late at night to ask for his help in establishing a cartoon studio. After Walt explained that he had secured a deal with New York distributor Margaret Winkler, Disney agreed and left the hospital the next morning—never again having a relapse of tuberculosis.

===Walt Disney Productions===
Together Roy and Walt founded the Disney Brothers Studio in October of 1923. Unlike Max and Dave Fleischer of rival Fleischer Studios, Roy was not a co-producer. But Roy was an equal partner in all facets of the production company. While Walt led the creative side, Roy guided the business side and finances. 

Roy became the company&#x27;s first CEO in 1929, although the official title was not given to him until 1966. He also shared the role of chairman of the board with Walt from 1945 and succeeded Walt in the position of president around this time as well. He held the position until 1968 when he handed it to Donn Tatum. In 1960, Walt dropped the chairman title so he could focus more on the creative aspects of the company. Following Walt&#x27;s death on December 15, 1966, from lung cancer, Roy postponed his retirement to oversee the construction of what was then known as Disney World. Five years after Walt&#x27;s death, Roy was able to open the resort at a cost of $400 million without having additional debt. He later named it Walt Disney World as a tribute to his brother.

==Personal life==
Roy was married to Edna Francis from April 1925 until his death. Roy met Edna in Kansas City, Missouri when she worked at &quot;The Kansas City Times&quot; along with close friend Meredith A. Boyington, and she introduced Meredith to Raymond Arnold Disney, who was an older brother to Roy O. Disney. Raymond and Meredith were married and were lifetime close friends to Edna and Roy; they had two sons, Charles Elias Disney and Daniel H. Disney. Roy and Edna&#x27;s son Roy Edward Disney was born on January 10, 1930. Roy Edward Disney later was vice chairman of the Walt Disney Company. Throughout his life, Roy Oliver Disney rejected the publicity and fame that came with being Walt&#x27;s brother. Roy&#x27;s nephew Charles Elias Disney chose to name his son Charles Roy Disney in Roy&#x27;s honor. Roy remained a member of the Freemasons for decades before he resigned his membership.

==Death==

After the opening of Walt Disney World on October 1, 1971, Roy finally retired, but soon after he died from a stroke at the age of 78 on December 20, 1971, five days after the fifth anniversary of his younger brother&#x27;s death. He is interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills) next to his wife Edna in Los Angeles.

==Legacy==

One of the Walt Disney World Railroad locomotives was named after Roy. On June 6, 2002, his son Roy E. Disney rededicated this locomotive in his father&#x27;s honor. In September 2016, the locomotive took part in its centennial celebration hosted by the Carolwood Pacific Historical Society.

One of the three Hong Kong Disneyland Railroad locomotives is also named after Roy, where each locomotive is named after a past Walt Disney Company president.

The Roy O. Disney Concert Hall, the primary performance space for the Herb Alpert School of Music at the California Institute of the Arts (of which Disney was a benefactor), is named after him.

&quot;Sharing the Magic&quot;, a statue of Disney seated on a park bench beside Minnie Mouse, was dedicated in October of 1999 as a companion piece to the &quot;Partners&quot; statue of Walt and Mickey Mouse. The statue is located in the Town Square of Main Street, U.S.A., at the Magic Kingdom at the Walt Disney World Resort. A duplicate of &quot;Sharing the Magic&quot; is located outside the Team Disney building at Disney&#x27;s corporate headquarters in Burbank, California—dedicated in 2003. A second copy is at the World Bazaar section of Tokyo Disneyland. The Roy O. Disney Suite is located on the top floor of the Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel.

In 2014, Roy O. Disney was portrayed in the feature film &quot;Walt Before Mickey&quot; by Jon Heder.

<doc id="164681" wikidata="Q7248371" url="?curid=164681" title="Prognostic variable">
<text>A prognostic variable in engineering within the context of prognostics, is a measured or estimated variable that is correlated with the health condition of a system, and may be used to predict its residual useful life.

An ideal prognostic variable is easily measured or calculated, and provides an exact estimation of how long time the system can continue to operate before maintenance or replacement will be required. Real prognostic variables are usually known with some uncertainty, may be difficult to measure, and their correlation to the system&#x27;s state of health may not be exact.

Examples of prognostic variables are the age of a vehicle and its odometer reading: the older a car is, and the longer it has been driven, the more worn it can be expected to be. These prognostic variables are useful but not ideal since they do not consider other aspects such as the regularity of the maintenance that was applied on the vehicle, how they were driven, in which weather conditions, etc.; they do, however, have the advantage of being easily measured, understood and verified, whereas an in-depth analysis of the mechanical condition of the vehicle would be expensive to perform, require specific skills to be understood and would be difficult to verify.

== In climate science ==
In climate science, the term indicates a variable that a computer model predicts by integration of a physical equation, typically vorticity, divergence, temperature, surface pressure, and water vapour concentration in atmospheric models.

The term &quot;prognostic&quot; is given to some values or variables that are directly predicted by the model, such as temperature, water vapour, salinity, and depth in atmospheric or ocean models, i.e., variables that can be directly obtained as a model outcome. On the other hand, some other variables need to be calculated separately as derived variables, such as relative humidity, which may be a diagnostic variable obtained from the model&#x27;s prognostic variables, temperature and water vapour.

<doc id="164685" wikidata="Q1501757" url="?curid=164685" title="Nyquist frequency">
<text>In signal processing, the Nyquist frequency (or folding frequency), named after Harry Nyquist, is a characteristic of a sampler, which converts a continuous function or signal into a discrete sequence. For a given sampling rate (&quot;samples per second&quot;), the Nyquist frequency &quot;(cycles per second&quot;) is the frequency whose cycle-length (or period) is twice the interval between samples, thus &quot;0.5 cycle/sample&quot;. For example, audio CDs have a sampling rate of 44100 &quot;samples/second&quot;. At &quot;0.5 cycle/sample&quot;, the corresponding Nyquist frequency is 22050 &quot;cycles/second&quot; (Hz). Conversely, the Nyquist rate for sampling a 22050 Hz signal is 44100 &quot;samples/second&quot;. 

When the highest frequency (bandwidth) of a signal is less than the Nyquist frequency of the sampler, the resulting discrete-time sequence is said to be free of the distortion known as aliasing, and the corresponding sample rate is said to be above the Nyquist rate for that particular signal.

In a typical application of sampling, one first chooses the highest frequency to be preserved and recreated, based on the expected content (voice, music, etc.) and desired fidelity. Then one inserts an anti-aliasing filter ahead of the sampler. Its job is to attenuate the frequencies above that limit. Finally, based on the characteristics of the filter, one chooses a sample rate (and corresponding Nyquist frequency) that will provide an acceptably small amount of aliasing. In applications where the sample rate is predetermined (such as the CD rate), the filter is chosen based on the Nyquist frequency, rather than vice versa.

== Folding frequency ==

In this example, is the sampling rate, and is the corresponding Nyquist frequency. The black dot plotted at represents the amplitude and frequency of a sinusoidal function whose frequency is 60% of the sample rate. The other three dots indicate the frequencies and amplitudes of three other sinusoids that would produce the same set of samples as the actual sinusoid that was sampled. Undersampling of the sinusoid at is what allows there to be a lower-frequency alias. If the true frequency were , there would still be aliases at 0.6, 1.4, 1.6, etc.

The red lines depict the paths () of the 4 dots if we were to adjust the frequency and amplitude of the sinusoid along the solid red segment (between    and  ).  No matter what function we choose to change the amplitude vs frequency, the graph will exhibit symmetry between 0 and    This symmetry is commonly referred to as folding, and another name for    (the Nyquist frequency) is folding frequency.

==Other meanings==
Early uses of the term &quot;Nyquist frequency&quot;, such as those cited above, are all consistent with the definition presented in this article. Some later publications, including some respectable textbooks, call twice the signal bandwidth the Nyquist frequency; this is a distinctly minority usage, and the frequency at twice the signal bandwidth is otherwise commonly referred to as the Nyquist rate.

<text>Don&#x27;t Break the Oath is the second studio album by Danish heavy metal band Mercyful Fate, released on 7 September 1984 through Roadrunner Records.

The style Mercyful Fate employed on &quot;Don&#x27;t Break the Oath&quot; resembled a mixture of heavy metal with progressive elements, lyrically preoccupied with Satan and the occult and distinguished by King Diamond&#x27;s theatrical falsetto vocals. Very influential to future black metal bands due to its lyrical content, the music itself tends toward progressive forms such as dramatic modulations, tempo and tone changes. The album was remastered and subsequently re-issued on Roadrunner Records in 1997. This reissue came with the bonus track &quot;Death Kiss (Demo)&quot;, which would eventually evolve into the album&#x27;s lead-off track, &quot;A Dangerous Meeting&quot;. The album received critical acclaim, and &quot;Metal Rules&quot; named this the greatest extreme metal album of all time.

<text>Kim Bendix Petersen (born 14 June 1956), better known by his stage name King Diamond, is a Danish rock musician. As a vocalist, he is known for his powerful and wide-ranging countertenor singing voice, in particular his far-reaching falsetto screams. He is the lead vocalist and lyricist for both Mercyful Fate and the eponymous King Diamond. He also plays keyboards and guitars on studio recordings but uses live shows to focus solely on his vocal performance. Diamond is renowned for his dark lyrical content and his story concepts. He is also known for his distinctive shock stage persona (in particular his black and white facepaint). He has been an influence for other rock and metal artists, including Metallica, Slayer and Cradle of Filth.

==Career==
===Early days===
King Diamond&#x27;s first heavy rock band was called Brainstorm (1974–76), with Jeanette Blum (Jean Blue) on vocals and bass, Michael Frohn (Mike West) on guitar and Jes Jacobsen (Jesse James) on drums. Diamond left Brainstorm and began singing with local Danish hard rock band Black Rose. He began experimenting with horror-themed theatrics and shaping a malevolent quasi-Satanic stage persona. He left Black Rose and joined the punk-metal band Brats, where he met Hank Shermann. The two were soon asked to help Michael Denner (also formerly a member of Brats) with his own project, Danger Zone. This band included Timi Hansen, and the musicians would join with Diamond in 1980 to become Mercyful Fate.

===Mercyful Fate===

Following Mercyful Fate&#x27;s 1984 release of &quot;Don&#x27;t Break the Oath&quot; and the subsequent tour (which saw them play in the U.S. for the first time), Diamond split ways with Mercyful Fate. With him, he took two of his bandmates (Hansen and Denner) to pursue a solo career under his own name.

Mercyful Fate reunited in 1992 (while Diamond simultaneously continued his solo career) and recorded five more studio albums. In 1999, Diamond and Hank Shermann performed the song &quot;Evil&quot; live with Metallica. This performance also featured Diamond without his famous makeup.
In 2000, Diamond decided to put Mercyful Fate on hold and continue on with his solo career.

On 1 August 2019 Mercyful Fate announced a reunion and an accompanying European tour.

In June 2022, Mercyful Fate debuted a new song, &quot;The Jackal of Salzburg&quot;. In August 2022, King Diamond confirmed that the band was actively working on a new album.

===King Diamond===

In 2001, King Diamond worked out a deal with the band Usurper to sing backup vocals on the song &quot;Necronemesis&quot; in exchange for them shifting their recording schedule around to accommodate the recording of &quot;Abigail II: The Revenge&quot;. In 2004, Diamond contributed vocals to &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, the final track on the album of Dave Grohl&#x27;s heavy metal side project Probot. In late 2005, Diamond appeared on the &quot;Roadrunner United – The All-Star Sessions&quot; album, contributing vocals for his song &quot;In the Fire&quot;, which featured multiple Roadrunner Records musicians (past and present) working together to create individual songs. Diamond also guested on the Cradle of Filth song &quot;Devil Woman&quot; in late 2005.

In April 2006, Diamond reunited with Mikkey Dee (Motörhead drummer) at a sold-out gig at Kåren in Gothenburg, Sweden. In 2001 he referred to Dee as &quot;one of the best drummers of all time and that&#x27;s something that has bothered us since he left.&quot;

Diamond released his album &quot;Give Me Your Soul... Please&quot;, on 26 June 2007. The band received a Grammy nomination in the &quot;Best Metal Performance&quot; category for the track &quot;Never Ending Hill&quot;.

He was forced to cancel a United States tour due to a herniated disk, causing severe back pain, which puts him in intense pain almost all of the time. He attributes the problem to the long stressful hours spent working on the album.

Diamond made an appearance at Ozzfest on 9 August 2008 at Frisco, Texas alongside Metallica, performing a medley of Mercyful Fate songs previously released on Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Garage Inc.&quot; album. He also performed a cover of the Pantera song &quot;A New Level&quot; with Vinnie Paul, Scott Ian, Max Cavalera, and Nick Bowcott.

In 2009, Diamond was revealed to be a playable character for the rhythm game &quot;Guitar Hero: Metallica&quot;, appearing with Mercyful Fate&#x27;s song &quot;Evil&quot;. The player must complete the song on any instrument and any difficulty to unlock the character.

On 29 November 2010, Diamond was taken to the hospital, where doctors discovered several blockages in his arteries due to his heavy smoking habit. They determined that he had had several heart attacks and that he needed triple-bypass surgery, during which time he was medically dead for five hours. The surgery was performed successfully and on 11 December 2010 it was announced that he was at home recovering. All his musical projects were placed on hold.

On 7 December 2011, Diamond appeared on stage with Metallica at the Fillmore in San Francisco to celebrate Metallica&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

In June 2012, Diamond performed his comeback concert at Sweden Rock Festival.

On Saturday 8 September 2012, Diamond appeared along with Mark Tremonti on VH1 Classic&#x27;s &quot;That Metal Show&quot; discussing his surgery and various details about upcoming events.

He appeared on Volbeat&#x27;s 2013 album, &quot;Outlaw Gentlemen &amp; Shady Ladies&quot;, providing guest vocals on the track &quot;Room 24&quot;. In August 2013 Diamond performed at Open Air Bloodstock Festival, UK.

Slayer was chosen to headline the 2015 Rockstar Energy Mayhem Festival. The bands HELLYEAH, King Diamond, The Devil Wears Prada, Thy Art Is Murder, Jungle Rot, Sister Sin, Sworn In, Shattered Sun, Feed Her To The Sharks, Code Orange and Kissing Candice also participated in the Rockstar Tour.

====Other media====
Diamond was a special celebrity guest star in four episodes of the Warner Bros. adult-oriented cartoon &quot;Metalocalypse&quot; as the Blues Devil, Ronald von Moldenberg, a fast food manager, and one of the Klokateers in 2006 on Adult Swim.

==Stage presence==
On stage, Diamond uses a microphone stand consisting of a femur bone and a tibia bone in the shape of a cross. He previously used a human skull, called Melissa, on stage. In the mid-1980s Melissa was stolen after a performance in the Netherlands.

Diamond has changed the design of his make-up often over the years. With &quot;Conspiracy&quot;, he wore a mesh of black and white line war paint, with some red &quot;blood&quot; made to look like a wound coming out of his forehead. With his album &quot;The Puppet Master&quot;, he used very little white and mainly had black crosses and inverted crosses going up and down his face.

==Influences==
Diamond cites Arthur Brown, David Byron, Alice Cooper, Ronnie James Dio, Ian Gillan, Ozzy Osbourne and Robert Plant as his primary influences.

According to Diamond&#x27;s biography on his official website, the first two albums he bought were Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Fireball&quot; and Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Master of Reality&quot;.

==Religion==
Diamond follows LaVeyan Satanism, which he does not see as a religion, but a philosophy by which he lived even before reading occultist Anton LaVey&#x27;s &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;. Michael Moynihan calls him &quot;one of the only performers of the &#x27;80s Satanic Metal who was more than just a poseur using a devilish image for shock value&quot;. Diamond has expressed concern that religion has led so many people to kill and destroy each other. He stated that he cannot comprehend why religion has caused so much death and destruction when it is logically impossible to prove the presence or absence of any deity. He states that he has reached a point in his life where he has completely given up believing in anything religious.

==Personal life==
Diamond is married to Livia Zita, a Hungarian-born singer who has made appearances as a backup vocalist on the albums &quot;The Puppet Master&quot; and &quot;Give Me Your Soul...Please&quot;, as well as during live performances. She is also his business partner, and is currently working with him to compile old footage for two planned DVD releases of King Diamond and Mercyful Fate live performances. She also helped him make remastered editions of the King Diamond albums &quot;The Spider&#x27;s Lullabye&quot;, &quot;The Graveyard&quot;, &quot;Voodoo&quot; and &quot;House of God&quot;.

In 2017, they became parents to a son, Byron, born in March.

==Legacy==
Metallica released an 11-minute medley of five Mercyful Fate songs on their 1998 &quot;Garage Inc.&quot; cover album. King Diamond has provided guest vocals for live performances of the medley at Metallica&#x27;s concerts on three occasions: at the 1999 Gods of Metal festival in Milan, Italy (with Hank Shermann on guitar); at the 2008 Ozzfest in Dallas, Texas; and at a 2011 Metallica fan club gig in San Francisco, California (with Hank Shermann on guitar, Michael Denner on guitar and Timi Hansen on bass).

King Diamond has appeared on the covers of many rock and metal magazines, and has influenced many artists, including Metallica&#x27;s Lars Ulrich, Cradle of Filth, Cage, and Andy DiGelsomina of the Wagnerian opera metal project Lyraka.

American heavy metal band Cage devoted to him the song &quot;King Diamond&quot; on the album &quot;Hell Destroyer&quot; in 2007.

<text>Karl Pearson (; born Carl Pearson; 27 March 1857 – 27 April 1936) was an English biostatistician and mathematician. He has been credited with establishing the discipline of mathematical statistics. He founded the world&#x27;s first university statistics department at University College London in 1911, and contributed significantly to the field of biometrics and meteorology. Pearson was also a proponent of Social Darwinism and eugenics, and his thought is an example of what is today described as scientific racism. Pearson was a protégé and biographer of Sir Francis Galton. He edited and completed both William Kingdon Clifford&#x27;s &quot;Common Sense of the Exact Sciences&quot; (1885) and Isaac Todhunter&#x27;s &quot;History of the Theory of Elasticity&quot;, Vol. 1 (1886–1893) and Vol. 2 (1893), following their deaths.

==Early life and education==
Pearson was born in Islington, London, into a Quaker family. His father was William Pearson QC of the Inner Temple, and his mother Fanny (née Smith), and he had two siblings, Arthur and Amy. Pearson attended University College School, followed by King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1876 to study mathematics, graduating in 1879 as Third Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos. He then travelled to Germany to study physics at the University of Heidelberg under G. H. Quincke and metaphysics under Kuno Fischer. He next visited the University of Berlin, where he attended the lectures of the physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond on Darwinism (Emil was a brother of Paul du Bois-Reymond, the mathematician). Pearson also studied Roman Law, taught by Bruns and Mommsen, medieval and 16th century German Literature, and Socialism. He became an accomplished historian and Germanist and spent much of the 1880s in Berlin, Heidelberg, Vienna, Saig bei Lenzkirch, and Brixlegg. He wrote on Passion plays, religion, Goethe, Werther, as well as sex-related themes, and was a founder of the Men and Women&#x27;s Club.
Pearson was offered a Germanics post at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Comparing Cambridge students to those he knew from Germany, Karl found German students inathletic and weak. He wrote to his mother, &quot;I used to think athletics and sport was overestimated at Cambridge, but now I think it cannot be too highly valued.&quot;

On returning to England in 1880, Pearson first went to Cambridge:

In his first book, &quot;The New Werther&quot;, Pearson gives a clear indication of why he studied so many diverse subjects:

Pearson then returned to London to study law, emulating his father. Quoting Pearson&#x27;s own account:
==Career==
His next career move was to the Inner Temple, where he read law until 1881 (although he never practised). After this, he returned to mathematics, deputising for the mathematics professor at King&#x27;s College, London in 1881 and for the professor at University College London in 1883. In 1884, he was appointed to the Goldsmid Chair of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics at University College London. Pearson became the editor of &quot;Common Sense of the Exact Sciences&quot; (1885) when William Kingdon Clifford died. 1891 saw him also appointed to the professorship of Geometry at Gresham College; here he met Walter Frank Raphael Weldon, a zoologist who had some interesting problems requiring quantitative solutions. The collaboration, in biometry and evolutionary theory, was a fruitful one and lasted until Weldon died in 1906. Weldon introduced Pearson to Charles Darwin&#x27;s cousin Francis Galton, who was interested in aspects of evolution such as heredity and eugenics. Pearson became Galton&#x27;s protégé, at times to the verge of hero worship.

After Galton&#x27;s death in 1911, Pearson embarked on producing his definitive biography—a three-volume tome of narrative, letters, genealogies, commentaries, and photographs—published in 1914, 1924, and 1930, with much of Pearson&#x27;s own money paying for their print runs. The biography, done &quot;to satisfy myself and without regard to traditional standards, to the needs of publishers or to the tastes of the reading public&quot;, triumphed Galton&#x27;s life, work and personal heredity. He predicted that Galton, rather than Charles Darwin, would be remembered as the most prodigious grandson of Erasmus Darwin.

When Galton died, he left the residue of his estate to the University of London for a chair in Eugenics. Pearson was the first holder of this chair—the &quot;Galton Chair of Eugenics&quot;, later the &quot;Galton Chair of Genetics&quot;—in accordance with Galton&#x27;s wishes. Pearson formed the Department of Applied Statistics (with financial support from the Drapers&#x27; Company), which combined the Biometric and Galton Laboratories. He remained with the department until his retirement in 1933, and continued to work until his death.

==Personal life==

In 1890, Pearson married Maria Sharpe. The couple had three children: Sigrid Loetitia Pearson, Helga Sharpe Pearson, and Egon Pearson, who became a statistician himself and succeeded his father as head of the Applied Statistics Department at University College. Maria died in 1928 and in 1929 Karl married Margaret Victoria Child, a co-worker at the Biometric Laboratory. He and his family lived at 7 Well Road in Hampstead, now marked with a blue plaque. He died at Coldharbour, Surrey, on 27 April 1936.

==Einstein and Pearson&#x27;s work==
When the 23-year-old Albert Einstein started the Olympia Academy study group in 1902, with his two younger friends, Maurice Solovine and Conrad Habicht, his first reading suggestion was Pearson&#x27;s &quot;The Grammar of Science&quot;. This book covered several themes that were later to become part of the theories of Einstein and other scientists. Pearson asserted that the laws of nature are relative to the perceptive ability of the observer. Irreversibility of natural processes, he argued, is a purely relative conception. An observer who travels at the exact velocity of light would see an eternal now, or an absence of motion. He speculated that an observer who travelled faster than light would see time reversal, similar to a cinema film being run backwards. Pearson also discussed antimatter, the fourth dimension, and wrinkles in time.

Pearson&#x27;s relativity was based on idealism, in the sense of ideas or pictures in a mind. &quot;There are many signs&quot;, he wrote, &quot;that a sound idealism is surely replacing, as a basis for natural philosophy, the crude materialism of the older physicists.&quot; (Preface to second Ed., &quot;The Grammar of Science&quot;) Further, he stated, &quot;... science is in reality a classification and analysis of the contents of the mind ... In truth, the field of science is much more consciousness than an external world.&quot; (&quot;Ibid.&quot;, Ch. II, § 6) &quot;Law in the scientific sense is thus essentially a product of the human mind and has no meaning apart from man.&quot; (&quot;Ibid.&quot;, Ch. III, § 4)

==Political views and eugenics==

Pearson was a &quot;zealous&quot; atheist, &quot;freethinker&quot;, and socialist. He gave lectures on such issues as &quot;the woman&#x27;s question&quot; (this was the era of the suffragist movement in the UK) and upon Karl Marx. His commitment to socialism and its ideals led him to refuse the offer of being created an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 1920 and also to refuse a knighthood in 1935.

A eugenicist who applied social Darwinism to entire nations, Pearson saw war against &quot;inferior races&quot; as a logical implication of the theory of evolution. &quot;My view – and I think it may be called the scientific view of a nation&quot;, he wrote, &quot;is that of an organized whole, kept up to a high pitch of internal efficiency by insuring that its numbers are substantially recruited from the better stocks, and kept up to a high pitch of external efficiency by contest, chiefly by way of war with inferior races.&quot; He reasoned that, if August Weismann&#x27;s theory of germ plasm is correct, the nation is wasting money when it tries to improve people who come from &quot;poor stock&quot;.

Weismann argued that acquired characteristics could not be inherited. Therefore, training benefits only the trained generation. Their children will not exhibit the learned improvements and, in turn, will need to be improved. &quot;No degenerate and feeble stock will ever be converted into healthy and sound stock by the accumulated effects of education, good laws, and sanitary surroundings. Such means may render the individual members of a stock passable if not strong members of society, but the same process will have to be gone through again and again with their offspring, and this in ever-widening circles, if the stock, owing to the conditions in which society has placed it, is able to increase its numbers.&quot;

History shows me one way, and one way only, in which a high state of civilization has been produced, namely, the struggle of race with race, and the survival of the physically and mentally fitter race. If you want to know whether the lower races of man can evolve a higher type, I fear the only course is to leave them to fight it out among themselves, and even then the struggle for existence between individual and individual, between tribe and tribe, may not be supported by that physical selection due to a particular climate on which probably so much of the Aryan&#x27;s success depended.

In &quot;The Myth of the Jewish Race&quot; Raphael and Jennifer Patai cite Karl Pearson&#x27;s 1925 opposition (in the first issue of the journal &quot;Annals of Eugenics&quot; which he founded) to Jewish immigration into Britain. Pearson alleged that these immigrants &quot;will develop into a parasitic race. [...] Taken &quot;on the average&quot;, and regarding both sexes, this alien Jewish population is somewhat inferior physically and mentally to the native population&quot;.

Pearson concluding remarks on stepping down as editor of the &quot;Annals of Eugenics&quot;, indicate a sense of failure of his aim to use the scientific study of eugenics as a guide for moral conduct and public policy. 
Nonetheless, in June 2020 UCL announced that it was renaming two buildings which had been named after Pearson, because of his connection with eugenics.

== Contributions to biometrics ==
Karl Pearson was important in the founding of the school of biometrics, which was one of several competing theories to describe evolution and population inheritance at the turn of the 20th century. His series of eighteen papers, &quot;Mathematical Contributions to the Theory of Evolution&quot; established him as the founder of the biometrical school for inheritance. In fact, Pearson devoted much time during 1893 to 1904 to developing statistical techniques for biometry. These techniques, which are widely used today for statistical analysis, include the chi-squared test, standard deviation, and correlation and regression coefficients. Pearson&#x27;s Law of Ancestral Heredity stated that germ plasm consisted of heritable elements inherited from the parents as well as from more distant ancestors, the proportion of which varied for different traits. Karl Pearson was a follower of Galton, and although the two differed in some respects, Pearson used a substantial amount of Francis Galton&#x27;s statistical concepts in his formulation of the biometrical school for inheritance, such as the law of regression. The biometric school, unlike the Mendelians, focused not on providing a mechanism for inheritance, but rather on providing a mathematical description for inheritance that was not causal in nature. While Galton proposed a discontinuous theory of evolution, in which species would have to change via large jumps rather than small changes that built up over time, Pearson pointed out flaws in Galton&#x27;s argument and actually used Galton&#x27;s ideas to further a continuous theory of evolution, whereas the Mendelians favored a discontinuous theory of evolution. While Galton focused primarily on the application of statistical methods to the study of heredity, Pearson and his colleague Weldon expanded statistical reasoning to the fields of inheritance, variation, correlation, and natural and sexual selection.

For Pearson, the theory of evolution was not intended to identify a biological mechanism that explained patterns of inheritance, whereas Mendelian&#x27;s theory postulated the gene as the mechanism for inheritance. Pearson criticized Bateson and other biologists for their failure to adopt biometrical techniques in their study of evolution. Pearson criticized biologists who did not focus on the statistical validity of their theories, stating that &quot;before we can accept [any cause of a progressive change] as a factor we must have not only shown its plausibility but if possible have demonstrated its quantitative ability&quot; Biologists had succumb to &quot;almost metaphysical speculation as to the causes of heredity,&quot; which had replaced the process of experimental data collection that actually might allow scientists to narrow down potential theories.

For Pearson, laws of nature were useful for making accurate predictions and for concisely describing trends in observed data. Causation was the experience &quot;that a certain sequence has occurred and recurred in the past&quot;. Thus, identifying a particular mechanism of genetics was not a worthy pursuit of biologists, who should instead focus on mathematical descriptions of empirical data. This, in part led to the fierce debate between the biometricians and the Mendelians, including Bateson. After Bateson rejected one of Pearson&#x27;s manuscripts that described a new theory for the variability of an offspring, or homotyposis, Pearson and Weldon established Biometrika in 1902. Although the biometric approach to inheritance eventually lost to the Mendelian approach, the techniques Pearson and the biometricians at the time developed are vital to studies of biology and evolution today.

==Contributions to statistics==
Pearson&#x27;s work was all-embracing in the wide application and development of mathematical statistics, and encompassed the fields of biology, epidemiology, anthropometry, medicine, psychology and social history. In 1901, with Weldon and Galton, he founded the journal &quot;Biometrika&quot; whose object was the development of statistical theory. He edited this journal until his death. Among those who assisted Pearson in his research were a number of female mathematicians who included Beatrice Mabel Cave-Browne-Cave, Frances Cave-Browne-Cave, and Alice Lee. He also founded the journal &quot;Annals of Eugenics&quot; (now &quot;Annals of Human Genetics&quot;) in 1925. He published the &quot;Drapers&#x27; Company Research Memoirs&quot; largely to provide a record of the output of the Department of Applied Statistics not published elsewhere.

Pearson&#x27;s thinking underpins many of the &#x27;classical&#x27; statistical methods which are in common use today. Examples of his contributions are:

*Correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient (first developed by Auguste Bravais and Francis Galton) was defined as a product-moment, and its relationship with linear regression was studied.
*Method of moments. Pearson introduced moments, a concept borrowed from physics, as descriptive statistics and for the fitting of distributions to samples.
*Pearson&#x27;s system of continuous curves. A system of continuous univariate probability distributions that came to form the basis of the now conventional continuous probability distributions. Since the system is complete up to the fourth moment, it is a powerful complement to the Pearsonian method of moments.
*Chi distance. A precursor and special case of the Mahalanobis distance.
*p-value. Defined as the probability measure of the complement of the ball with the hypothesized value as center point and chi distance as radius.
*Foundations of statistical hypothesis testing theory and statistical decision theory. In the seminal &quot;On the criterion...&quot; paper, Pearson proposed testing the validity of hypothesized values by evaluating the chi distance between the hypothesized and the empirically observed values via the p-value, which was proposed in the same paper. The use of preset evidence criteria, so called alpha type-I error probabilities, was later proposed by Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson.
*Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test. A hypothesis test using normal approximation for discrete data.
*Principal component analysis. The method of fitting a linear subspace to multivariate data by minimising the chi distances.
*The first introduction of the histogram is usually credited to Pearson.

==Awards from professional bodies==
Pearson achieved widespread recognition across a range of disciplines and his membership of, and awards from, various professional bodies reflects this:
*1896: elected FRS: Fellow of the Royal Society
*1898: awarded the Darwin Medal
*1911: awarded the honorary degree of LLD from the University of St Andrews
*1911: awarded a DSc from University of London
*1920: offered (and refused) the OBE
*1932: awarded the Rudolf Virchow medal by the Berliner Anthropologische Gesellschaft
*1934: offered (and refused) the Guy Medal of the Royal Statistical Society 
*1935: offered (and refused) a knighthood

He was also elected an Honorary Fellow of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, University College London and the Royal Society of Medicine, and a Member of the Actuaries&#x27; Club. A sesquicentenary conference was held in London on 23 March 2007, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of his birth.

<text>Marjorie Merriweather Post (March 15, 1887 – September 12, 1973) was an American businesswoman, socialite, and philanthropist. She was the daughter of C. W. Post and the owner of General Foods Corporation. For much of Post&#x27;s life, she was known as the wealthiest woman in the United States.

Post used much of her fortune to collect art, particularly Imperial-era Russian art, much of which is now on display at Hillwood, the museum which was her estate in Washington, D.C. She is also known for her mansion, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Florida.

==Early life==
Marjorie Merriweather Post was born in Springfield, Illinois, the daughter and only child of C. W. Post and Ella Letitia Merriweather. At age 27, following her father&#x27;s death in 1914, she became the owner of the rapidly growing Postum Cereal Company, founded in 1895. She inherited a US$ 20 million fortune. 

Post lived in Battle Creek, Michigan from ages 3-14. She then moved to Washington, D.C. to attend the Mount Vernon Seminary and College (now the George Washington University&#x27;s Mount Vernon Campus). She maintained a close lifelong relationship with her alma mater and served as its first alumna trustee. Today, a collection of her correspondence with Mount Vernon administrators is maintained by GWU&#x27;s Special Collections Research Center. Post&#x27;s complete collection of personal papers, as well as those of her father, are held by the University of Michigan&#x27;s Bentley Historical Library.

== General Foods Corporation ==
Post became the owner of Postum Cereal Company in 1914, after the death of her father, and was a director of the company until 1958. She, along with her second husband, E.F. Hutton, began expanding the business and acquiring other American food companies such as Hellmann&#x27;s Mayonnaise, Jell-O, Baker&#x27;s Chocolate, Maxwell House, and many more. In 1929, Postum Cereal Company was renamed General Foods Corporation.

While taking a voyage on her yacht, the &quot;Hussar&quot;, she came across the innovations of Clarence Birdseye in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Birdseye had developed a new way to preserve food by freezing it. Post foresaw the future advantages of frozen food, and bought Birdseye&#x27;s company, which eventually became a success.

== Philanthropy ==
Post funded a U.S. Army hospital in France during World War I, and, decades later, the French government awarded her the Legion of Honour, in the degree of Commander. Starting in 1929 and throughout the Great Depression, she financed and personally supervised a Salvation Army feeding station in New York. She also donated the cost of the Boy Scouts of America headquarters in Washington. Years later in 1971, she was among the first three recipients of the Silver Fawn Award, presented by the Boy Scouts of America. The 425-acre (172 ha) Lake Merriweather at Goshen Scout Reservation in Goshen, Virginia, was named in her honor. Camp Post is named for her.

In 1966, at Long Island University&#x27;s C.W. Post College, located on her former Long Island estate, she became honorary housemother of Zeta Beta Tau&#x27;s Gamma Delta chapter, often hosting the fraternity brothers for brunches. Post served as the honorary house mother of the college&#x27;s first local fraternity, Sigma Beta Epsilon, which, in 1969, became the New York Beta chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Since Post had borne only girls, she referred to the fraternity of sons-in-law as her &quot;boys&quot;, while they called her &quot;Mother Marjorie&quot;. Post was honored by Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity as a &quot;Golden Daughter of Minerva&quot;.

She donated $100,000 to the National Cultural Center in Washington that would later become the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. In 1955, she contributed $100,000 to the National Symphony for free concerts that led to the beginning of the Music for Young America Concerts, which she financed annually. The Merriweather Post Pavilion, an outdoor concert venue in Columbia, Maryland, is named for her.

==Lifestyle==

=== Jewelry ===
Some of Post&#x27;s jewelry, bequeathed to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., is displayed in the Harry Winston exhibit. Pieces in the collection include the Napoleon Diamond Necklace and the Marie Louise Diadem, a 275-ct (55 g) diamond-and-turquoise necklace and tiara set that Napoleon I gave to his second wife, Empress Marie Louise; the Marie Antoinette Diamond Earrings, a pair of diamond earrings set with pear shapes, weighing 14 ct (2.8 g) and 20 ct (4 g), once belonging to Marie Antoinette; the Blue Heart Diamond, a 30.82-ct (6.164 g) heart-shaped blue diamond ring; and an emerald-and-diamond necklace and ring, once belonging to Habsburg aristocrat and one time emperor of Mexico, Maximilian.

===Russian art collection===
According to the Hermitage Museum Foundation, Post was a Russophile. During the 1930s, the Soviet government under Joseph Stalin began selling art treasures and other valuables seized from the Romanov family and former Russian aristocrats after the Russian Revolution to earn hard currency for its industrialization and military armament programs. Critics have claimed that these items were expropriated; however, the transactions by Post and her third husband, Joseph E. Davies, were from the recognized governmental authority. Neither Post nor Davies were involved with the original seizing of the items. Allegations later surfaced that many works of art from the Tretyakov Gallery and other collections were either donated or offered at nominal prices to the couple, who were both art collectors. Davies is also alleged to have purchased art expropriated from Soviet citizens well after the Russian Revolution, including victims of Stalin&#x27;s Terror at discount prices from Soviet authorities.

Many of the items, which remain under the control of the Post estate or its agents, can be viewed at Hillwood, her former estate. Hillwood has operated as a private museum since Post&#x27;s death and displays her French and Russian art collection, featuring the work of Fabergé, Sèvres porcelain, French furniture, tapestries, and paintings.

== Notable residences ==
* Mar-a-Lago, Palm Beach, Florida: Designed by Marion Sims Wyeth and Joseph Urban, Post willed Mar-a-Lago to the United States federal government in 1973 as a retreat for presidents and visiting foreign dignitaries. Congress repealed acceptance of the estate in 1980 and the Post Foundation sold it to Donald Trump in 1986. Ultimately the mansion was thus used for this purpose during the Trump administration. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1980; it had been a National Historic Site since 1969.
* Hillwood (Washington, D.C.): now operates as a private museum since Post&#x27;s death and displays her French and Russian art collection, featuring the work of Fabergé, Sèvres porcelain, French furniture, tapestries, and paintings.
* Camp Topridge, Upper St. Regis Lake, New York: a &quot;rustic retreat&quot; in the Adirondack Mountains. It included a fully staffed main lodge and private guest cabins, each staffed with its own butler. The expansive Great Camp, built in 1923 by Benjamin A. Muncil, eventually contained nearly 70 buildings, as well as a Russian dacha, on 300 acres. It was one of only two Adirondack camps to be featured in &quot;Life&quot; magazine.
* &quot;Sea Cloud&quot; (&quot;Hussar V&quot;): a yacht that was personally designed by Post, and built as a replacement for the original yacht &quot;Hussar IV&quot; for her and her second husband, E. F. Hutton, in 1931. It was the largest privately owned sea-going yacht in the world at the time. They traveled the world on it for portions of the year with their daughter Nedenia. After her divorce from Hutton, she renamed the yacht &quot;Sea Cloud&quot;, and continued to sail it with her new husband Joseph E. Davies for his ambassadorial trips to the Soviet Union. She sold the yacht in 1955 to the President of the Dominican Republic, Rafael Trujillo; it is now a cruise ship.
* Hillwood (Long Island): Built in 1922 in Brookville, New York, after Post purchased and greatly altered the former Warburton Hall Estate, it was designed in the Tudor revival style by architect Charles Mansfield Hart. Post sold it in 1951 to Long Island University, and the property would later become LIU Post. In 2005, it was restored and renamed Winnick House and is used for campus administration, academic offices and event space.

==Personal life==

=== Marriages ===
Edward Bennett Close: In 1905, Post married investment banker Edward Bennett Close of Greenwich, Connecticut. They divorced in 1919. Together, they had two daughters:
*Adelaide Brevoort Close (1908–1998), who married three times, to Thomas Wells Durant, Merrall MacNeille, and Augustus Riggs IV.
*Eleanor Post Close (1909–2006), later known in the media as &quot;Eleanor Post Hutton&quot;, married six times, to film director Preston Sturges, Etienne Marie Robert Gautier, George Curtis Rand, Hans Habe, Owen D. Johnson (son of author Owen Johnson), and orchestra conductor Léon Barzin.
Via his second marriage, Edward Bennett Close would later become the paternal grandfather of actress Glenn Close.

Edward Francis Hutton: Post was married for a second time, in 1920, to financier Edward Francis Hutton. In 1923, he became the chairman of the board of the Postum Cereal Company. Together they developed a larger variety of food products, including Birdseye Frozen Foods. The company became the General Foods Corporation in 1929. Post and Hutton divorced in 1935. They had one daughter:
* Nedenia Marjorie Hutton (1923–2017), better known as the actress Dina Merrill.

Joseph E. Davies: In 1935, Post married her third husband, Joseph E. Davies, a Washington, D.C., lawyer. They had no children and were divorced in 1955. From November 1936 to June 1938, in a crucial period leading up to World War II, Davies served as the American ambassador to the Soviet Union, ruled at that time by Joseph Stalin. Post accompanied Davies to Moscow, and they acquired many valuable Russian works of art from Soviet authorities at very reasonable prices.

Herbert A. May: Post&#x27;s final marriage, in 1958, was to Herbert A. May, a wealthy Pittsburgh businessman and the former master of fox hounds of the Rolling Rock Hunt Club in Ligonier, Pennsylvania. That marriage ended in divorce in May 1964 and she subsequently reclaimed the name Marjorie Merriweather Post.

=== Death ===
Post died at her Hillwood estate in Washington, D.C., on September 12, 1973, after a long illness, and was buried there. She left the bulk of her estate to her three daughters.

==In popular culture==
Merriweather Post was portrayed by Ann Harding in the 1943 film &quot;Mission to Moscow&quot;. It was a dramatization of the book by the same title, written by her third husband Joseph E. Davies, who had chronicled his time as U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union.

Anne Francis portrayed Merriweather Post in the 1987 miniseries &quot;Poor Little Rich Girl: The Barbara Hutton Story&quot;. She was portrayed by Morgan Bradley in the History Channel docudrama series &quot;The Food That Built America&quot;, which debuted in 2019.

A fictionalized version of Merriweather Post was played by Amy Schumer in the 2024 Netflix film &quot;Unfrosted&quot; written by Jerry Seinfeld.

In 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article, &quot;Mystery on Fifth Avenue&quot;, about a luxury Fifth Avenue apartment that the occupants, Steven Klinsky and Maureen Sherry, had &quot;redesigned to include hidden compartments, messages, puzzles, poems, codes and games for their four preteen kids.&quot; The apartment was originally part of a triplex built for Merriwether Post in the 1920s. The redesign was undertaken by Eric Clough and his architectural firm, 212box. American filmmaker J. J. Abrams purchased the rights to &quot;Mystery on Fifth Avenue&quot; but as yet no film about it has been produced.

==Legacy==
Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland, is named in her honor because of her years of sustained financial support for the National Symphony.

Merriweather Hall (formerly &#x27;The Post House&#x27;) and Post Hall, at the George Washington University&#x27;s Mount Vernon Campus, is named in her honor.

<text>Reign of Fire is a 2002 post-apocalyptic science fantasy film directed by Rob Bowman and starring Matthew McConaughey, Christian Bale, Izabella Scorupco and Gerard Butler with the screenplay written by Matt Greenberg, Gregg Chabot, and Kevin Peterka.

The film is set in England in the year 2020, eighteen years after a London Underground tunneling project inadvertently awakened dragons from centuries of slumber and the creatures have subsequently replaced humans as the dominant species on Earth. With the fate of mankind at stake, two surviving parties, led by Quinn Abercromby (Bale) and Denton Van Zan (McConaughey), find that they must work together to hunt down and destroy the beasts in a desperate attempt to take back the world.

The film was released by Buena Vista Pictures through the Touchstone Pictures label on 12 July 2002. Upon release, it received generally mixed reviews from critics and underperformed at the box office, grossing far less than expected, only $82 million on a $60 million budget.

==Plot==
Quinn Abercromby is visiting a London Underground construction project. Construction workers penetrate a cave and a dragon emerges from hibernation, incinerating the workers with its fire breath. The only survivor is Quinn, whose mother Karen, the project engineer, dies protecting him. The dragon flies out of the Underground and soon more dragons appear. The world&#x27;s militaries fail to stop the spread of the dragon population and target large populated areas with nuclear weapons, leaving humans nearly extinct.

Eighteen years later, the dragons are dying off but have become increasingly aggressive in search of food. Quinn, along with his best friend Creedy, leads a community of survivors at Bamburgh Castle, Northumberland where he plans to outlast dragons until they return into hibernation; as insurance, he shares his notes and plans with Jared, an orphan he rescued and is mentoring to take over as community leader. The community is short on supplies, causing unrest pending the harvest of their meager crops. Eddie and some of his followers steal a truck to harvest the crops for food but are attacked by a dragon. Quinn, Creedy, and Jared repel the dragon, which burns most of the crops, leaving the community without food.

A group of heavily armed Americans led by Denton Van Zan then arrive in an armored convoy, including a tank and a utility helicopter. Quinn is initially skeptical and suspects they are marauders, but Van Zan convinces him to let them stay when he reveals the dragons&#x27; main weakness: poor vision during twilight. With Quinn&#x27;s help, Van Zan and his team slay the dragon who destroyed the crops.

Van Zan introduces Quinn to Alex Jensen, his team&#x27;s helicopter pilot and intelligence officer, and briefs Quinn on their mission. After killing hundreds of dragons, Alex discovered they were all female; she postulates that they reproduce quickly because the species relies on a single male to fertilize all the eggs en masse. Having tracked the spread of the dragons, they believe that the male is in London and that if they kill it, the dragons will no longer be able to reproduce, effectively eradicating the species. Quinn, suspecting that the male dragon is the same one that killed his mother, refuses to help, knowing that London is infested with dragons and that if they fail, the dragons will track them back to their shelter.

Van Zan drafts the castle defenders, despite Quinn&#x27;s objections. Van Zan, Alex, and some of the castle&#x27;s men then depart for London, but true to Quinn&#x27;s warnings, their caravan is attacked by the male dragon. Everyone except for Van Zan and Alex are killed. The dragon then finds the castle and attacks, killing many of its inhabitants. Quinn gets the survivors to an underground bunker, but they are trapped by rubble when the dragon returns; during this attack, Creedy is killed.

Van Zan and Alex return and free everyone trapped in the bunker. Quinn leaves Jared in charge and decides to help Van Zan and Alex hunt down the male dragon. They fly to London and find hundreds of female dragons; one is cannibalized by the much larger male out of hunger. This scatters the female dragons and leaves the male alone. Van Zan coordinates a plan: split up, bait the male into attacking, ground him with explosive crossbow bolts, and shoot one into his mouth once he is ground level. The plan initially works, but the dragon detonates the first explosive bolt early with its fire breath and Van Zan is swallowed whole. Quinn and Alex gather the last explosives and lure the dragon to ground level, where Quinn fires an explosive down the dragon&#x27;s throat, killing it.

Three months later, Quinn and Alex erect a radio tower on a hill overlooking the North Sea, having seen no dragons since the battle in London. Jared arrives and reveals they have contact with French survivors who want to speak to the group&#x27;s leader. Quinn declares Jared the new community leader and dedicates himself to rebuilding civilization with Alex.

==Cast==
==Production==
Kevin Peterka and Gregg Chabot wrote the original screenplay in 1996, after which they sold it to Spyglass Media Group. In 2000 Matt Greenberg revised the screenplay for production.

&quot;Reign of Fire&quot; was filmed in Ireland&#x27;s Wicklow Mountains, at the Glendasan Valley Lead Mines. Permission was given on the condition that the area not be damaged, and the crew removed all sets once filming was complete. However, an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Europe stopped many planned scenes from being filmed due to quarantine restrictions.

The dead dragon was designed and built by Artem, with visual effects by Secret Lab. The dragon&#x27;s digital effects posed a problem for animators: &quot;In recent years there have been several movies starring creatures with scaled surfaces. Among these are &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;Dragonheart&quot;, and &quot;Lake Placid&quot;. The surfaces of these creatures have generally been constructed by layering painted textures atop displacement maps. This gives the model texture, but the scales stretch and shrink under the movement of the creature, giving a rubbery look that is not realistic.&quot; In order to overcome this limitation, the then-groundbreaking work done by digital effects animator Neil Eskuri on Disney&#x27;s 2000 release &quot;Dinosaur&quot; was utilized as a benchmark in order to create a realistic physical simulation of the dragon. According to Carlos Gonzalez-Ochoa, the film called for &quot; creatures with wing spans of that could undergo enormous speeds and accelerations. The artistic direction required each dragon to have wings that transition between a variety of physical behaviors and interact with the environment.&quot;

==Soundtrack==


==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 42% based on 173 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Reign of Fire&quot; gains some altitude with its pyrotechnic action and a smolderingly campy Matthew McConaughey, but the feature&#x27;s wings are clipped by a derivative script and visual effects that fizzle out.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 39 out of 100, based on 30 reviews from critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F.

Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; said of the film, &quot;An uncommonly exciting and satisfying post-apocalyptic popcorn flick, director Rob Bowman deftly combines an uncommonly satisfying mix of medieval fantasy, high-tech military action and &quot;Mad Max&quot;-style misadventure.&quot; Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a B grade, saying &quot;the season could do with more grinning, spinning, un-self-important, happy-to-be-B throwback movies like this one.&quot; Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;the movie might have been a minor classic if it had maximized its own possibilities. But until the rush wears off, the picture is as much fun as a great run at a slot machine: even when your luck runs out, you&#x27;re losing only pocket change.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film one star out of four, describing it as &quot;a vast enterprise marshaled in the service of such a minute idea&quot;, adding that &quot;the movie makes no sense on its own terms, let alone ours. And it is such a grim and dreary enterprise. One prays for a flower or a ray of sunshine as those grotty warriors clamber into their cellars and over their slag heaps.&quot;

&quot;Reign of Fire&quot; was third at the US box-office receipts during its opening weekend (12 July 2002), taking in $15,632,281, behind &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; and &quot;Men in Black II&quot;.

==Awards==
&quot;Reign of Fire&quot; was nominated for one Saturn Award (but lost to &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;) and two Sitges Film Festival awards, winning one.
==Video game==
In 2002, Kuju Entertainment released the video game adaptation &quot;Reign of Fire&quot; for PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube, which received mixed reviews much like the film it was based on.

==Cancelled sequel==
In a 2002 interview, Christian Bale was asked: &quot;Is there a sequel possibility to &quot;Reign of Fire&quot;?&quot; to which Bale responded: &quot;Possibly. I told Scott Moutter, who plays my stepson in the movie, that he&#x27;s well positioned to take the sequel from me because of the way the movie ends!&quot;. However, due to the film underperforming at the box office, no development on a sequel has been spoken of since. Twenty years later, Bale joked that a sequel would be made &quot;for &quot;Dexerto&quot;&#x27;s eyes only.&quot;

==Legacy==
The mechanism of dragon&#x27;s fire breath in this movie, inspired from biology of real-life creatures such as anti-predator adaptation of bombardier beetle and poison glands of vipers, was used in later works such as &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, &quot;Gods of Egypt&quot;, and &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

<doc id="164699" wikidata="Q5006960" url="?curid=164699" title="C. W. Post">
<text>Charles William Post (October 26, 1854 – May 9, 1914) was an American innovator, breakfast cereal and foods manufacturer and a pioneer in the prepared-food industry. He was the founder of what is now Post Consumer Brands.

==Early life and education==

Post, commonly known as &quot;C. W.&quot;, was born October 26, 1854, in Springfield, Illinois, the son of Charles Rollin Post and Caroline Lathrop Post, and grew up in the adopted hometown of Abraham Lincoln, who served as President of the United States during Post&#x27;s childhood.

Post graduated from public schools in Springfield, and then enrolled at Illinois Industrial University, where he remained for two years before leaving without a degree.

After a brief stay in Independence, Kansas, Post returned to Springfield, where he remained for over a decade working as a salesman and manufacturer of agricultural machinery. During this interval Post invented and patented several farm implements, including a plow, a harrow, and a hay-stacking machine.

In November 1874, Post married Ella Letitia Merriweather; they had one daughter, Marjorie. Ella supported her husband throughout his career and cared for him when he was ill. As Post became wealthier and began spending more time away from Ella, who was often ill, his relationship with her waned. Against her wishes, Post separated from her in 1904 and married his second wife, Leila Young, his 27-year-old secretary, in November 1904. Marjorie, who remained close to her father, later said that her mother died of &quot;a broken heart&quot; after Post divorced her and married his secretary. In a deceitful attempt to have his daughter become closer with his secretary (soon to be wife), C. W. hired her to be a travel companion for Marjorie. When Marjorie realized the ruse, she deeply resented Leila.

==Career==

Post suffered a mental breakdown in November 1885, the result of the stress and overwork which accompanied his job as a farm implement manufacturer. Post made a break with his previous life, moving to Texas in 1886, where he came into association with a group of real estate developers in Fort Worth, who were attempting to establish a new community on the eastern outskirts of a town called Riverside. In 1888, Post began a real estate development of his own in Fort Worth on that he had obtained, platting the land for streets and homes and constructing two mills.

The stress of this work again proved too much for Post&#x27;s constitution, and a second breakdown followed in 1891. Post began a period of extensive travels in search of a cure, coming to take particular interest in the chemistry of digestion. After a period traversing Europe, Post visited the Battle Creek Sanitarium of Battle Creek, Michigan, a facility operated by John Harvey Kellogg (brother of Kellogg Company founder Will Keith Kellogg). Post has been accused of stealing several of Kellogg&#x27;s recipes, including Kellogg&#x27;s Caramel Coffee Cereal (Post&#x27;s Postum), Cornflakes (Toasties), and Malted Nuts (Grape-Nuts).

In 1895, Post founded Postum Cereal Co., with his first product, Postum cereal beverage. Post&#x27;s first breakfast cereal premiered in 1897, and he named the product Grape-Nuts cereal because of the fruity aroma noticed during the manufacturing process and the nutty crunch of the finished product. In 1904, he followed up the Grape-Nuts label with a brand of corn flakes, which was first called Elijah&#x27;s Manna before being renamed Post Toasties in 1908. The British government refused to allow Post to market his cereal in the United Kingdom using the name Elijah&#x27;s Manna, stating that it was sacrilegious.

In 1906, Post invested some of his substantial earnings from his food products manufacturing into Texas real estate, purchasing a massive tract in Garza and Lynn Counties. Post platted a new town, which he called Post City. Shade trees were planted, farm parcels laid out, and a hotel, a school, churches, and a department store were constructed for the new Garza County seat.

In 1907, &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; published an article questioning the claim made in advertisements that Grape-Nuts could cure appendicitis. Post responded with advertisements questioning the mental capacity of the article&#x27;s author, and &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; sued for libel. The case was heard in 1910, and Post was fined $50,000. The decision was overturned on appeal, but advertisements for Postum products stopped making such claims.

Post was a staunch opponent of the trade union movement and was remembered by the National Association of Manufacturers as one who &quot;opposed bitterly boycotts, strikes, lockouts, picketing and other forms of coercion in the relations between employer and employee&quot;. Post was also a leading public advocate of the open shop system. However, as compensation, Post paid the highest wages, and provided bonuses and benefits. Near Battle Creek, he had model homes built that were sold to employees under certain conditions.

==Death==
At the end of 1913, Post&#x27;s health deteriorated to the point that he canceled public appearances. 

In early March 1914, he was believed to be suffering from appendicitis, and was rushed via a nonstop train from California to the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minnesota, to be operated on by William Mayo and Charles Mayo, who were regarded as the nation&#x27;s preeminent surgeons at the time. The Mayo brothers operated successfully on Post sometime between March 5 and March 10, 1914, but Post&#x27;s abdominal pain persisted, according to the book &quot;American Empress: The Life and Times of Marjorie Merriweather Post&quot;. 

Post then returned to his home in Santa Barbara, California with his stomach pain persisting. On May 9, 1914, despondent over his ongoing stomach illness and its symptoms, Post died by suicide with a self-inflicted gunshot. He was 59 years old. He was interred at Oak Hill Cemetery in Battle Creek.

==Legacy==
Post&#x27;s 27-year-old daughter, Marjorie Merriweather Post, inherited his company along with most of his vast fortune, one of the largest of the early 20th century.

Marjorie Merriweather Post later married financier E. F. Hutton and owned a estate on Long Island&#x27;s North Shore called &quot;Hillwood.&quot; Marjorie sold the estate in 1951 for $200,000 to Long Island University, which founded its residential C.W. Post College in 1954, marking the 100th anniversary of C. W. Post&#x27;s birth. For a while it was named the C.W. Post Center and then the C.W. Post Campus. What was C.W. Post College has now become mainly a commuter campus called LIU/Post, and it has about 8,500 full- and part-time students and over 100,000 alumni.

The World War II Liberty Ship, , was named in his honor.

<doc id="164700" wikidata="Q57195" url="?curid=164700" title="Frederick V of the Palatinate">
<text>Frederick V (; 26 August 1596 – 29 November 1632) was the Elector Palatine of the Rhine in the Holy Roman Empire from 1610 to 1623, and reigned as King of Bohemia from 1619 to 1620. He was forced to abdicate both roles, and the brevity of his reign in Bohemia earned him the derisive sobriquet &quot;the Winter King&quot; (Czech: &quot;Zimní král&quot;; German: &quot;Winterkönig&quot;).

Frederick was born at the hunting lodge () in Deinschwang, Palatinate (present-day Lauterhofen, Germany). He was the son of Frederick IV and of Louise Juliana of Orange-Nassau, the daughter of William the Silent and Charlotte de Bourbon-Montpensier. An intellectual, a mystic, and a Calvinist, he succeeded his father as Prince-Elector of the Rhenish Palatinate in 1610, and at the age of 17 was married to the Protestant princess Elizabeth Stuart.

In 1618 the largely Protestant Czech nobility of Bohemia rebelled against their Catholic king, Ferdinand II, beginning a conflict that would become the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Frederick was asked to assume the crown of Bohemia. He accepted the offer and was crowned on 4 November 1619, as Frederick I. The estates chose Frederick because he was the leader of the Protestant Union, a military alliance founded by his father, and hoped for the support of Frederick&#x27;s father-in-law, James VI of Scotland and I of England. However, James opposed his son-in-law&#x27;s takeover of Bohemia from the Habsburgs and Frederick&#x27;s allies in the Protestant Union failed to support him militarily by signing the Treaty of Ulm. His brief reign as king of Bohemia ended with his defeat at the Battle of White Mountain on 8 November 1620 – a year and four days after his coronation.

After the battle, the Imperial forces invaded Frederick&#x27;s Palatine lands, forcing him to flee to his uncle Prince Maurice, Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic in 1622. An Imperial edict formally deprived him of the Palatinate in 1623. He lived the rest of his life in exile with his wife and family, mostly at The Hague, and died in Mainz in 1632.

His eldest surviving son Charles Louis was restored to the electorate in 1648 under the Peace of Westphalia. Another son was Prince Rupert of the Rhine, one of the most colourful figures of his time. His daughter Princess Sophia was eventually named heiress presumptive to the British throne, and is the founder of the Hanoverian line of kings.

==Youth, 1596–1610==

Frederick was born on 26 August 1596 was born at the hunting lodge () in Deinschwang, Palatinate (present-day Lauterhofen, Germany). His father, Frederick IV, was the ruler of Electoral Palatinate; his mother was Louise Juliana of Nassau, the daughter of William I of Orange and Charlotte de Bourbon-Monpensier. Frederick was related to almost all of the ruling families of the Holy Roman Empire and a number of diplomats and dignitaries attended his baptism at Amberg on 6 October 1596. The Palatine Simmerns, the elder branch of the House of Wittelsbach, were noted for their attachment to Calvinism; this was in marked contrast to the other cadet branch of Wittelsbachs, headed by Duke Maximilian of Bavaria, which was deeply devoted to the Roman Catholic Church.

The capital of the Palatinate, Heidelberg, was suffering from an outbreak of bubonic plague at this time, so Frederick spent his first two years in the Upper Palatinate before being brought to Heidelberg in 1598. In 1604, at his mother&#x27;s urging, he was sent to Sedan to live in the court of his uncle Henri de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon. During his time at Sedan, Frederick was a frequent visitor to the court of Henry IV of France. His tutor was Calvinist theologian Daniel Tilenus, a professor of theology at the Academy of Sedan. During the Eighty Years&#x27; War and the French Wars of Religion, Tilenus called for the unity of Protestant princes, and taught that it was their Christian duty to intervene if their brethren were being harassed. These views are likely to have shaped Frederick&#x27;s future policies.

==Controversy over guardianship, 1610–1614==

On 19 September 1610, Frederick&#x27;s father, Frederick IV, died from &quot;extravagant living&quot;; his son being 14 years old at the time. Under the terms of the Golden Bull of 1356, Frederick&#x27;s closest male relative would serve as his guardian and as regent of the Palatinate until Frederick reached the age of majority. However, his nearest male relative, Wolfgang William, Count Palatine of Neuburg, was a Catholic, so, shortly before his death, Frederick IV had named another Wittelsbach, John II, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken, as his son&#x27;s guardian. Frederick V welcomed John to Heidelberg, whereas Wolfgang William was denied entry. This led to a heated dispute among the princes of the Holy Roman Empire. 

In 1613, Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor intervened in the dispute, with the result being that Frederick V was able to begin his personal rule in the Palatinate even though he was still underage. The dispute ended in 1614, when Frederick attained his eighteenth birthday. However, much bad blood among the houses was caused by this dispute.

==Marriage to Elizabeth Stuart==

Frederick IV&#x27;s marriage policy had been designed to solidify the Palatinate&#x27;s position within the Reformed camp in Europe. Two of Frederick V&#x27;s sisters were married to leading Protestant princes: his sister Luise Juliane to his one-time guardian John II, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken, and his sister Elizabeth Charlotte to George William, Elector of Brandenburg. Frederick IV had hoped that his daughter Katharina would marry the future Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, although this never came to pass.

In keeping with his father&#x27;s policy, Frederick V sought a marriage to Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of James VI of Scotland and I of England. James had initially considered marrying Elizabeth to Louis XIII of France, but these plans were rejected by his advisors. Frederick&#x27;s advisors in the Palatinate were worried that if Elizabeth were married to a Catholic prince, this would upset the confessional balance of Europe, and they were thus resolved that she should marry Frederick V. Hans Meinhard von Schönberg, who had served as Frederick V&#x27;s &quot;Hofmeister&quot; since his return to Heidelberg, was sent to London to court the princess in spring 1612. After intense negotiations, a marriage contract was signed on 26 May 1612, over the objection of her mother, Queen Anne.

Frederick travelled to London to collect his bride, landing on English soil on 16 October 1612. Frederick and Elizabeth, who had previously corresponded in French, now met each other for the first time, and got on well together. They were formally engaged in January 1613 and married on 14 February 1613 at the royal chapel at the Palace of Whitehall. The event was celebrated in John Donne&#x27;s poetic masterpiece &quot;Epithalamion, or Mariage Song on the Lady Elizabeth, and Count Palatine being married on St. Valentines Day&quot;. Shortly before the ceremony, Frederick was inducted into the Order of the Garter and he wore the Order&#x27;s chain during the wedding ceremony. Elaborate celebrations, organised by Francis Bacon, followed the ceremony; these included a performance of &quot;The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray&#x27;s Inn&quot; by Francis Beaumont and &quot;The Memorable Masque of the Middle Temple and Lincoln&#x27;s Inn&quot; by George Chapman.

On their return trip to Heidelberg, Frederick and Elizabeth travelled to The Hague to visit Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange before leaving for Germany on 5 May 1613. The couple entered Heidelberg on 12 June 1613, amidst widespread celebration. Elizabeth was popular with Frederick&#x27;s subjects, and this popularity grew when, on 1 January 1614, she gave birth to a son, Frederick Henry.

As part of the marriage negotiations, Frederick had agreed to expand Heidelberg Castle. These renovations were completed in 1615 and the &quot;Elizabeth Entrance&quot; to Heidelberg Castle was dedicated.

==Electoral reign before the Thirty Years&#x27; War, 1614–1618==

One of Frederick&#x27;s first acts upon taking the reins of government was attendance at a meeting of the Protestant Union, during which he was struck by fever and nearly died. Subsequently contemporaries described him as changed, melancholy and possibly depressed. As such, Frederick transferred much responsibility to his chancellor, Christian I, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg.

Frederick undertook a large building campaign, designed to glorify his regime. In addition to the renovations to Heidelberg Castle mentioned above, he commissioned a courtyard garden, the &quot;Hortus Palatinus&quot;, designed by English gardener Inigo Jones and French engineer Salomon de Caus. Frederick was depicted therein as Apollo and as Hercules.

Politically, Frederick positioned himself as a leader of the Protestant princes in the Holy Roman Empire, and as a defender of the liberty of the German nobles against the Catholic Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor. Since the Peace of Augsburg, the Empire had been delicately balanced between Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist principalities (although Calvinism was not recognised in the Peace of Augsburg). The conflicts between princes of these three faiths developed into a deep struggle over the Empire&#x27;s constitution. Furthermore, the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce, a hiatus in the Eighty Years&#x27; War, was set to expire in 1621, and was likely to lead to renewed fighting between the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Empire.

With its central location in Germany, the Palatinate was vulnerable to incursions of imperial troops from the Habsburg hereditary lands. Unlike many principalities of the Holy Roman Empire, the Electoral Palatinate was not a solid dominion, but instead consisted of two unconnected provinces surrounded by foreign lands. The Lower Palatinate centred on Heidelberg, while the Upper Palatinate centred on Amberg. The Lower Palatinate&#x27;s economy was dominated by agriculture, while the Upper Palatinate was a mining region with one of the most successful economies in Europe.

==King of Bohemia, 1619–20==
===Background and plans===
The Kingdom of Bohemia was an elective monarchy, and despite being a kingdom, was a part of the Holy Roman Empire. Since 1526, the kings of Bohemia had all been members of the House of Habsburg; since 1555, these kings had also been emperors. In the early seventeenth century, however, Bohemia faced a political crisis. The Estates of the realm of Bohemia became worried that the Habsburgs were planning to transform Bohemia into an absolute monarchy. A large number of Bohemian nobles were Protestant and feared that a Catholic emperor would attempt to impose Catholicism on Bohemia. Thus, a substantial opposition movement developed to the rule of Emperor Rudolf II. Rudolf had waged the Long War against the Ottoman Empire from 1593 to 1606. Dissatisfied with the outcome, Rudolf sought to launch a new war against the Ottomans. To gain Bohemian support, Rudolf agreed to guarantee Bohemia&#x27;s religious liberty, issuing his so-called Letter of Majesty in 1609. Still, the Bohemian nobles remained suspicious of Rudolf and in contact with the Protestant Union.

The Bohemian Estates elected the Habsburg Matthias as Rudolf&#x27;s heir, and Matthias became king of Bohemia in 1611 and emperor in 1612. Yet in the latter year there was discussion within the Protestant Union about fielding a Protestant candidate to supplant Matthias as king of Bohemia, and Frederick&#x27;s name was discussed in this regard. Strategists in the Palatinate believed that if Frederick became king, this would lead John George I, Elector of Saxony, to break his alliance with the Habsburgs and come fully to the Protestant cause. This assumption proved unfounded.

Meanwhile, the sectarian conflicts in Bohemia continued. In 1617, Matthias prevailed on the Bohemian Estates to elect the Habsburg Ferdinand, Duke of Styria, as heir to the throne of Bohemia. Ferdinand was an intensely loyal Catholic, and many Protestant noblemen believed that Ferdinand intended to withdraw the protections of Rudolf II&#x27;s Letter of Majesty. These suspicions were further aroused when Imperial officials ordered Protestants to stop erecting Protestant churches on the &quot;Stifts&quot;, lands held by ecclesiastical lords who were not subject to the Bohemian Estates. The Protestants claimed the status of these lands fell under the term &quot;royal land&quot;, and thus were subject to Bohemia&#x27;s authority by the Letter of Majesty – a very disputed legal interpretation which the Habsburg government rejected. On 23 May 1618, an assembly of Protestant noblemen, led by Count Jindřich Matyáš Thurn, stormed Prague Castle, and seized two Imperial governors, Vilem Slavata of Chlum and Jaroslav Borzita of Martinice. The rebels charged them with violating the Letter of Majesty, found them guilty, and threw them and their scribe Philip Fabricius out of the windows of the Bohemian Chancellery. This event – known as the Second Defenestration of Prague – marked the beginning of the Bohemian Revolt, and with it, the beginning of the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

In these circumstances Christian I, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg, Frederick V&#x27;s governor of the Upper Palatinate, moved to intervene in Bohemia. He did not initially propose nominating Frederick as king because the young elector was still seen as politically inexperienced, and was a Calvinist, while there were virtually no Calvinists in Bohemia. At any rate, Frederick was not initially eager to defy the Emperor, who had praised Frederick&#x27;s loyalty. Frederick did not publicly break with the Emperor, but in a letter to his father-in-law, James I of England, he placed the blame for the Bohemian vote on the Jesuits and the Spanish party at the Habsburg court. This was a questionable evasion of the role played by Frederick&#x27;s own agents.

The first mention in Prague of Frederick&#x27;s name as a possible candidate as king of Bohemia came in November 1618. It is not known if Frederick&#x27;s agents played a role in talking up his possible candidacy. Palatine diplomat Christoph von Dohna approached James I of England with the possibility of Frederick becoming king, but James reacted negatively to this idea. The princes of the Protestant Union similarly rejected the idea, fearing it might lead to religious war and the Elector of Saxony was staunchly opposed.

Behind the scenes, Frederick authorised sending a force under Count Ernst von Mansfeld to support the Bohemian rebels. In August 1618, forces under Mansfeld entered Bohemia and led the Siege of Pilsen, which saw Pilsen fall to rebel forces on 21 November 1618, leaving the entire kingdom in Protestant hands.

Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor died on 20 March 1619. Although his successor, the future Emperor Ferdinand II, had previously been crowned King of Bohemia, the Estates of Bohemia now refused to recognise him as their king. Fearing an invasion by Imperial forces, the Estates sought an alliance with the other members of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (Silesia, Lusatia, Moravia) and on 31 July 1619 at Prague, these states formed the Bohemian Confederacy, dedicated to opposing the Habsburgs; under the terms of this agreement, Protestantism became virtually the state religion of the Bohemian lands. In August 1619, the general parliament of all the Bohemian lands declared that Ferdinand had forfeited the Bohemian throne. This formally severed all ties between Bohemia and the Habsburgs and made war inevitable. Ferdinand of Bavaria, Archbishop of Cologne predicted this decision would lead to twenty, forty, or sixty years of war.

The preferred candidate of Bohemians as their new king was the Elector of Saxony, but he let it be known he would not accept the throne. This left Frederick as the most senior Protestant prince available, since no one else was willing to risk conflict with the emperor. In August 1619, the chances of Frederick becoming King of Bohemia became greater when Gabriel Bethlen launched an anti-Habsburg revolt in Royal Hungary. This was also precisely the period when Ferdinand was travelling to Frankfurt for his coronation.

===Frederick in Prague===
On 26 August 1619, the states of the Bohemian Confederacy elected Frederick as the new King of Bohemia, Frederick receiving news of his election on 29 August in Amberg.

Two days later, Ferdinand II was elected Holy Roman Emperor. Frederick was the only elector who voted against Ferdinand; even the Protestant prince-electors John George I of Saxony and John Sigismund of Brandenburg adhered to the tradition of supporting the Habsburg Imperial candidate. The electoral college also condemned the Bohemian Confederation&#x27;s attempt to remove Ferdinand from the throne of Bohemia and declared that the 1617 vote of the Estates of Bohemia, making Ferdinand King of Bohemia, was binding.

Frederick&#x27;s decision to accept the Bohemian crown has been the subject of much historical speculation. Later Catholic propaganda, in a view accepted by Friedrich Schiller, portrayed the decision as based mainly on Elizabeth Stuart&#x27;s desire to be a queen. More recently, historians have concluded that Frederick&#x27;s decision was based primarily on a sense of duty to his fellow Protestants, although Frederick wavered between his obligations to the emperor and his commitment to his religious brethren. There also seems to have been economic considerations; the Upper Palatinate was at that time Europe&#x27;s center for iron production, while Bohemia was a focal point for the tin and glass trade. Christian I, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg, told Frederick that a union of the two areas could be commercially advantageous.

On 12 September 1619, the Protestant Union met at Rothenburg ob der Tauber and called on Frederick not to intervene in Bohemian affairs. Other possible allies – the Dutch Republic, Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, and the Republic of Venice – sent letters saying they would not be able to offer Frederick assistance if he accepted the Bohemian offer. Only Gabriel Bethlen offered words of encouragement.

Between 24 September and 28, Frederick reached his decision &quot;not to resist the will of the Almighty&quot; and thus decided to accept the Bohemian crown. The Dutch Republic, the Republic of Venice, Denmark, and Sweden recognised Frederick as King of Bohemia.

On 29 September 1619, Frederick left Heidelberg for Prague. He travelled through Ansbach, Amberg, Neumarkt, and Waldsassen, where he was met by representatives from the Bohemian Estates. Together, they then travelled through Cheb, Sokolov, Žatec, Louny, and Slaný. Finally on 31 October 1619, Frederick entered Prague, along with 568 people and 100 cars, and was greeted enthusiastically.

===Coronation===

Frederick donned the Crown of Saint Wenceslas in St. Vitus Cathedral on 4 November 1619. The coronation was conducted not by the Archbishop of Prague but by the Utraquist administrator of the diocese, Jiřík Dicastus, and a Protestant elder, Jan Cyril Špalek z Třebíče. The liturgy was modelled on that used at the coronation of Charles IV, with only a few parts altered. The litany was sung – per the Catholic tradition – rather than spoken as was normally done by the Calvinists. Frederick was anointed with little objection. At the end of the coronation, the Estates paid homage to Frederick.

Although a large part of the country was already devastated by war, and many refugees were encamped in the town, the coronation was celebrated with lavish parties.

===Reign===
Frederick assumed a weak crown and a state torn with internal divisions. The state&#x27;s finances had been disrupted for years, and, at any rate, Bohemian kings had only very limited ability to raise funds, being primarily dependent on the goodwill of the nobility and the tax allocations of the diets. The Protestant nobles felt that higher taxes were necessary to pay for war against the German Catholic League, but the country already felt overburdened in the wake of the Long War. Further limiting Frederick&#x27;s ability to manoeuvre was the need to distribute royal bounty to supporters in order to ensure their loyalty to his regime.

In Prague, Frederick soon came to be alienated from a portion of the nobility and the clergy. Neither Frederick nor his wife spoke Czech, so court offices were staffed primarily with foreigners, while the administration of the localities was left to the local nobles. This made an alliance of the royal family with the corporate bodies of the realm difficult.

Further alienation was caused by Frederick V&#x27;s court preacher, Abraham Scultetus, who was determined to use his new post to advance the cause of Calvinism in Bohemia. The Utraquist churches had retained the use of relics and images in church, but Scultetus now launched an iconoclastic crusade against images: beginning on 21 December 1619, images were removed from St. Vitus Cathedral, and on 27–28 December, the famous Prague Altarpiece of Lucas Cranach the Elder depicting the Virgin Mary was destroyed. There was even a rumour that the grave of St. Wenceslaus was to be desecrated. Scultetus&#x27; iconoclasm was deeply unpopular, and Frederick attempted to distance himself from it, claiming that his orders were not being carried out by his followers.

The nickname &quot;The Winter King&quot; appeared shortly after the beginning of Frederick&#x27;s reign and our first printed reference using the term came in a 1619 Imperial pamphlet that presented the phrase in the context of a royal chronogram. Frederick&#x27;s propagandists attempted to respond to the phrase by arguing that Frederick was in fact a &quot;Winter Lion&quot; who defended the crown of Bohemia against troublemakers and liars, and that he would also be a &quot;Summer Lion.&quot;

Meanwhile, Ferdinand II rallied his forces against Frederick. On 21 October 1619, he signed a treaty with Maximilian, Duke of Bavaria, leader of the Catholic League. This treaty provided that Maximilian would be commander of the forces against Frederick, promised that Maximilian would retain all of the occupied Bohemian lands for himself, and that he would be granted Frederick&#x27;s electoral title as well. The Emperor was also able to obtain the support of Elector John George I of Saxony; John George&#x27;s court preacher, Matthias Hoe von Hoenegg, encouraged the Emperor to smash Frederick and the Bohemians.

Frederick&#x27;s chancellor, Christian of Anhalt, urged Frederick to call a meeting of Protestant princes at Nuremberg in December 1619. This conference was a fiasco, as few princes bothered to send representatives. John George of Saxony declined to send a representative. Those who did attend half-heartedly promised to secure Frederick&#x27;s Rhineland territories during Frederick&#x27;s absence in Bohemia.

In March 1620, during a meeting of the Imperial party at Mulhouse, Frederick despatched a legal defense of his actions. He argued that he had not broken the imperial peace because Bohemia was located outside of the Holy Roman Empire and there was not, therefore, a conflict between an imperial prince and the emperor. Frederick argued that it would therefore be illegal for Ferdinand to use imperial power against him. This meeting, which included John George of Saxony and Maximilian of Bavaria, rejected Frederick&#x27;s argument, finding that Bohemia was an indivisible part of the Empire.

On 1 April 1620, the Imperial party issued an ultimatum calling on Frederick to leave Bohemia by 1 June. If Frederick did not comply by this date, Ferdinand threatened to enforce his right as Holy Roman Emperor and rightful King of Bohemia to overthrow the usurper.

A little later, John George of Saxony signed a treaty with Ferdinand in which Ferdinand guaranteed the practice of Lutheranism in Bohemia and recognized the secular areas in the Netherlands. Ferdinand also agreed to give John George Lusatia, thus cementing John George&#x27;s dominance of the Upper Saxon Circle.

This was the context when the parliament of the Bohemian Confederacy met on 25 March 1620. Frederick called for massive tax increases and conscription to fight the impending Imperial threat. To raise money for the Bohemian forces, Frederick used his private funds, pawned his jewels and, in May 1620, drove the Palatinate into insolvency when he decided to move two tons of gold to Bohemia.

Bad news continued to arrive for Frederick. James VI of Scotland and I of England refused to support his son-in-law militarily. The Netherlands sent only a small force and promised only 50,000 florins a month for Frederick. Worst of all for Frederick, on 3 July 1620, the Protestant Union signed the Treaty of Ulm (1620), thereby withdrawing their support for Frederick and declaring neutrality in the conflict between Frederick and the Catholic League.

====Battle of White Mountain, 8 November 1620====
With the signing of the Treaty of Ulm Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquis of the Balbases, began raising Imperial troops in the Spanish Netherlands and in the Alsace region.

In early August 1620, 25,000 troops, under the command of Spinola, marched into Bohemia. In the third week of August, they shifted their focus and marched into the nearly unarmed Electoral Palatinate, occupying Mainz. The Electoral Palatinate was defended by only 2,000 English volunteers and the country was easily taken. Imperial troops set up camp in Frankenthal and Mannheim. Spinola crossed the Rhine on 5 September 1620 and proceeded to capture Bad Kreuznach on 10 September and Oppenheim on 14 September. From Bohemia, Frederick was powerless to stop the occupation of his ancestral homeland.

After capturing Linz, Upper Austria, Maximilian, Duke of Bavaria crossed the Bohemian border on 26 September 1620. At Rokycany, Maximilian&#x27;s forces first met with the 15,000 ragtag, poorly paid and poorly equipped troops that Frederick had managed to raise. Frederick visited his army on 28 September 1620, but, lacking a military background, left the conduct of the war to his generals. Frederick focused his attention on organizing supplies and preparing fortifications.

After a series of skirmishes, on 5 November 1620, Frederick drew his forces back towards Prague and Imperial troops followed them. On 7 November, Bohemian forces determined to make a stand at White Mountain, just outside Prague. The day before, King Frederick had ridden down the lines and exhorted the soldiers. He then rushed to Prague to implore the Bohemian Estates to raise money for his troops and to receive the envoys of the English king. However, it was too late. When, on 8 November 1620, Frederick wanted to ride back to the troops, he was met at the gates of Prague by fleeing soldiers of his army and his chancellor, Anhalt, who informed him of the disaster: the Bohemian army had received a crushing defeat that morning in the Battle of White Mountain.

===Escape===
Anhalt could recommend only one option to Frederick: immediate flight. As such, on 9 November, Frederick fled to the Silesian capital of Breslau, along with his wife and child, some advisers, and not much more baggage than the Bohemian Crown Jewels.

Maximilian took Prague shortly after Frederick&#x27;s departure. From Silesia, Frederick wanted to plan revenge for the Battle of White Mountain, but the Silesian Estates refused to support this project, and he was forced to leave Silesia in early 1621.

Contemporary pamphleteers – both Catholic and Protestant – were merciless in their portrayal of Frederick&#x27;s flight from Prague. After Frederick&#x27;s Garter was found in Prague, pamphleteers routinely portrayed him with his stockings falling down.

On 21 January 1621, Ferdinand issued a decree against Frederick and Anhalt, accusing them of breach of peace, supporting rebels, and treason. Ferdinand decreed that Frederick&#x27;s lands and titles within the Holy Roman Empire were now forfeited. On 6 February 1621, representatives of the Protestant Union met with Ferdinand at Heilbronn to protest, but they soon agreed to support the settlement in the Palatinate, and the Palatinate remained occupied by Spanish troops. At this point, the Protestant Union had essentially ceased to exist.

The Twelve Years&#x27; Truce ended on 9 April 1621. On 14 April, Frederick joined his wife at The Hague. The Dutch Republic and Frederick signed a contract in which he accepted the support of the Netherlands for the reconquest of his dominions.

In Bohemia, the crushing of the Bohemian Revolt had terrible consequences. Twenty-seven Bohemian nobles were killed in the Old Town Square executions on 21 June 1621. Afterwards, the heads of twelve nobles, along with the hand of Joachim Andreas von Schlick, were nailed to the Old Town Tower of Charles Bridge, where they remained for ten years. The elective monarchy was now abolished; the role of the Estates greatly curtailed; and the Letter of Majesty was torn by Ferdinand himself. Only Lutheranism remained tolerated in Bohemia, and in the coming years, the rest of the population would be actively re-Catholicized. Bohemia would remain part of the Habsburg monarchy until 1918.

==Fall of Frederick&#x27;s ancestral lands, 1621–22==

In summer 1621, John II, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken, Frederick&#x27;s former guardian who had served as regent of the Electoral Palatinate when Frederick left for Prague, resigned. Frederick was also at this time placed under the Imperial ban, which permitted the forfeiture of his territories and effectively rendered him an outlaw.

However, Ernst von Mansfeld continued to occupy a portion of the Upper Palatinate and had successfully resisted efforts by Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly to dislodge him. Mansfeld crossed into the Rhenish Palatinate in early 1622, and on 21 April 1622, Frederick joined Mansfeld there. Frederick attempted to convince other Protestant princes to reconstitute the Protestant Union, but met with limited success. Frederick&#x27;s cause was boosted by a 27 April 1622 victory over Tilly&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Wiesloch, but this boost was short lived. Frederick&#x27;s forces under the command of Georg Friedrich, Margrave of Baden-Durlach were defeated at the Battle of Wimpfen on 6 May 1622; and then forces under Christian the Younger of Brunswick were soundly defeated at the Battle of Höchst on 20 June 1622.

Frederick was increasingly under Mansfeld&#x27;s influence at this time, and was growing disillusioned with the Protestant cause. With Frederick&#x27;s knowledge, Mansfeld raided Darmstadt and captured Louis V, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt and his son Johann as hostages. This was clearly a violation of Imperial law, and cost Frederick whatever remaining sympathy he still had in Europe. During his retreat into Alsace, Mansfeld burned a city and thirty villages.

Frederick dismissed Mansfeld after he became convinced he would be unable to reconquer his hereditary lands. Frederick then spent the summer with his uncle, Henri de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon, in Sedan.

Shortly thereafter, troops under Tilly and Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba completed the Spanish conquest of the Electoral Palatinate. After an eleven-week siege, Heidelberg fell on 19 September 1622; Mannheim similarly fell on 5 November 1622. Only the British garrison in Frankenthal now held out. After the conquest of Heidelberg, the Protestant churches were closed, the university was closed, and at the request of Maximilian, the great library, the famous &quot;Bibliotheca Palatina&quot; (3500 manuscripts), was presented as a gift of thanks to Pope Gregory XV in appreciation of the 620,000 guilders he had provided for financing the campaigns of the Catholic League.

On 23 February 1623, Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor awarded Frederick&#x27;s electoral title to Maximilian of Bavaria, who now became Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria. Maximilian was also awarded the conquered territory of Upper Palatinate as a fief. Other territories of the Electoral Palatinate (Parkstein, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, and Peilstein im Mühlviertel) were awarded to Wolfgang William, Count Palatine of Neuburg.

==Exile, 1622–1632==
In late 1622 and early 1623, Frederick organised a Palatinate government-in-exile at The Hague. This Palatinate council was headed by Ludwig Camerarius.

During the negotiations for the Spanish match, Frederick urged his father-in-law not to go through with the match.

There were attempts at reconciling Frederick with the emperor in 1624–25 and in 1627, but these came to naught. Frederick was willing to compromise with the emperor, but he wanted the restoration of his lands and electoral title, and the emperor was not inclined to restore these to Frederick. Frederick held out some hope that his lands might be retaken militarily, but these hopes were crushed on 27 August 1626, when the forces of Christian IV of Denmark were crushed by Tilly at the Battle of Lutter.

Frederick left most of the day-to-day business of his government-in-exile to his counselors, although he did take some interest in his finances. Frederick was very stingy in funding his administration, and yet, in order to maintain the dignity of a royal court, he spent vast sums on building and entertainment, quickly blowing through donations from the English and Dutch governments. For example, in 1629, Frederick commissioned Bartholomeus van Bassen to build him a large summer palace in Rhenen, the &#x27;Koningshuis&#x27;. When completed in 1631, this palace had a large central residence, a courtyard, a two-storey main building with two wings projecting to the south, and was surrounded by large gardens. Frederick spent much of his time there in hunting and long walks.

Frederick suffered a personal tragedy on 17 January 1629. He was traveling to Amsterdam to view the Spanish treasure fleet captured by the Dutch West India Company when his boat capsized while crossing the Haarlemmermeer, a body of water near Haarlem. Frederick survived the accident, but his eldest son, the fifteen-year-old Frederick Henry of the Palatinate, did not. Frederick himself sustained serious physical injuries in the accident, and would not fully recover for 15 months.

At the Diet of Regensburg (1630), Frederick formally petitioned to be forgiven for having accepted the crown of Bohemia and admitted his wrongdoing. But nothing came of this. In March 1631, Frederick despatched diplomat Sir Robert Anstruther to hold discussions with Ernst Egon VIII, Count of Fürstenberg, president of the Imperial Privy Council, about restoring Frederick&#x27;s lands, but Frederick died before these could bear any fruit.

==Death==
In 1630, King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden intervened in the Thirty Years&#x27; War on the Protestant side. He won the Battle of Breitenfeld (1631) against the Imperial army and marched into southern Germany. When the Swedes captured Oppenheim in December 1631, Frederick believed the time was ripe for him to reestablish himself in the Palatinate, and he left for Heidelberg.

In February 1632, Frederick met Gustavus Adolphus at Frankfurt, with Gustavus Adolphus paying Frederick full royal honours. However, Gustavus Adolphus did not offer Frederick support for restoring him in the Palatinate because England and the Netherlands had not signed off on such a proposal.

Frederick subsequently took part in Gustavus Adolphus&#x27; march into the Duchy of Bavaria, and was present for the march into Munich on 17 May 1632. He pressed his case with Gustavus Adolphus, who told Frederick that he would accept Frederick&#x27;s restoration without Dutch/British support only if Frederick would agree to hold the Palatinate as a fief of the King of Sweden. The lands of the Palatinate were simply too important strategically for Gustavus Adolphus to hand them over to Frederick. Gustavus Adolphus also insisted that Frederick would have to establish equal rights for Lutherans in his territories. Frederick refused Gustavus Adolphus&#x27; conditions and they parted. Frederick travelled to Swedish-occupied Mainz, intending to return to the Hague.

About this time, England finally determined to send an expeditionary force to Germany. Unfortunately for Frederick, it was too late. Gustavus Adolphus was killed at the Battle of Lützen (1632) on 16 November, and in October, Frederick developed an infection that got worse in the following weeks. The famed physician Peter Spina was summoned from Darmstadt to Mainz, but nothing could be done for Frederick. He died on the morning of 29 November 1632, of a &quot;pestilential fever&quot;.

Frederick&#x27;s son and heir, Charles Louis, was only 15 years old. Therefore, his uncle, Frederick&#x27;s brother Ludwig Philipp of Simmern-Kaiserslautern, served as regent. Frederick&#x27;s internal organs were buried at St. Catherine&#x27;s in Oppenheim and his embalmed body was taken to Frankenthal. On 9 June 1635, with Spanish troops approaching, Ludwig Philipp fled to Kaiserslautern with Frederick&#x27;s body. It is believed that Ludwig Philipp transferred Frederick&#x27;s body to Sedan in September 1637, but Frederick&#x27;s final resting place is unknown.

<text>The Nabis (, ) were a group of young French artists active in Paris from 1888 until 1900, who played a large part in the transition from Impressionism and academic art to abstract art, symbolism and the other early movements of modernism. The members included Pierre Bonnard, Maurice Denis, Paul Ranson, Édouard Vuillard, Ker-Xavier Roussel, Félix Vallotton, Paul Sérusier and Auguste Cazalis. Most were students at the Académie Julian in Paris in the late 1880s. The artists shared a common admiration for Paul Gauguin and Paul Cézanne and a determination to renew the art of painting, but varied greatly in their individual styles. They believed that a work of art was not a depiction of nature, but a synthesis of metaphors and symbols created by the artist. In 1900, the artists held their final exhibition and went their separate ways.

==Etymology==
The Nabis took their name from a Hebrew term which comes from the word &quot;nebiim&quot; or &quot;prophets&quot; The term was coined in 1888 by the linguist Auguste Cazalis, who drew a parallel between the way these painters aimed to revitalize painting (as &#x27;prophets of modern art&#x27;) and the way the ancient prophets had rejuvenated Israel.

==Beginning==
The Nabis were a group of young artists of the Académie Julian in Paris, who wanted to transform the foundations of art. One of the artists, Paul Sérusier, had traveled to Pont-Aven in October 1888, where under the guidance of Paul Gauguin he made a small painting of the port on wood, composed of patches of vivid color assembled to give the feeling of the port. The students called this first Nabis painting &quot;The Talisman&quot;, and it eventually became an icon of 20th-century art.

In 1889, the same year of the Paris International Exposition and the opening of the Eiffel Tower, the group held its first modest exposition at the Café des Arts, which was located without the grounds of the Exposition. It was titled &quot;The Impressionist and Synthesist Group&quot;, and included works by two well-known artists, Paul Gauguin and Émile Bernard.

In August 1890, Maurice Denis, then nineteen years old, gave the group a more concrete philosophy. Writing under the name Pierre Louis, he wrote an article in the journal &quot;Art et Critique&quot; entitled &quot;The Definition of Neo-traditionalism&quot;, which became the manifesto of the movement. The celebrated opening line of the essay was: &quot;Remember that a picture, before being a battle horse, a female nude or some sort of anecdote, is essentially a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order.&quot; This idea was not original to Denis; the idea had been put forward not long before by Hippolyte Taine in &quot;The Philosophy of Art&quot;, where Taine wrote: &quot;A painting is a colored surface, in which the various tones and various degrees of light are placed with a certain choice; that is its intimate being.&quot; However, it was the expression of Denis which seized the attention of artists. As Denis explained, he did not mean that the form of the painting was more important than the subject. He wrote, &quot;The profoundness of our emotions comes from the sufficiency of these lines and these colors to explain themselves...everything is contained in the beauty of the work.&quot; In his essay, he termed this new movement &quot;neo-traditionalism&quot;, in opposition to the &quot;progressivism&quot; of the Neo-impressionists, led by Seurat.

The following year, in 1891, three of the Nabis, Pierre Bonnard, Édouard Vuillard and Maurice Denis, took a studio at 28 rue Pigalle in Paris. It was frequented by other early Nabis, including Ker-Xavier Roussel and Paul Sérusier, as well as journalists and figures from the theatrical and literary world.

In 1892, the Nabis branched out into the theatrical world and the decorative arts. Paul Ranson, assisted by Sérusier, Bonnard, and Vuillard, designed sets for a theatrical presentation of the &quot;Bateau ivre&quot; of the poet Arthur Rimbaud. Maurice Denis made costumes and sets for another theatrical production, the &quot;Trilogy d&#x27;Antoina&quot; at the Théatre Moderne, and also painted a ceiling for the residence of the art collector and painter Henry Lerolle.

The Nabis held a group exhibition in Toulouse in June 1894, and the following year presented their work in Siegfried Bing&#x27;s Maison de l&#x27;Art Nouveau, the famous gallery which had given its name to the Art Nouveau movement.

Throughout their existence the Nabis were a sort of half-serious semi-secret society, who used humorous nicknames and a private vocabulary. Even the name of the group was secret until 1897. They called a studio an &#x27;ergasterium&#x27; and ended their letters with the initials &quot;E.T.P.M.V. et M.P.&quot;, signifying &quot;En ta paume, mon verbe et ma pensée&quot; (&quot;In your palm, my word and my thoughts&quot;).

==Japanese influence==
The graphic art of Japan, known as Japonism, particularly woodblock prints, was an important influence on the Nabis. The style was popularized in France by the art dealer Siegfried Bing, who traveled to Japan to collect prints by Hokusai and other Japanese artists, and published a monthly art journal, &quot;Le Japon Artistique&quot;, between May 1888 and April 1891, which offered color illustrations. In 1900 he organized an exhibit of seven hundred prints at the École des Beaux-Arts.

Pierre Bonnard was particularly influenced by the Japanese style; his nickname among the Nabis was &quot;Le plus japonard&quot;. For one series of four paintings created in 1890–91, &quot;The Women in the Garden&quot;, now in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, Bonnard adapted a Japanese format called &quot;kakemono&quot; with a narrow vertical canvas. The models are his sister Andrée and his cousin Berthe Schaedin. The four figures are presented in curving, serpentine postures, like those in Japanese prints. The faces of the women look away from the artist; the bold patterns of their costumes and the foliage behind them dominate the paintings. He originally conceived the work as a Japanese screen, but he finally decided to separate it into four paintings, and to emphasize the decorative aspect, he added a painted border around the canvases.

The theme of women in a garden, stylistically adapted from Japanese prints, appeared in the work of other Nabis, including Maurice Denis and Paul Sérusier. Denis used the theme of women in gardens in paintings and decorative murals. Sérusier adapted the same format in his &quot;Women at the Spring&quot; (1898), stylistically depicting women descending a hill to take water from a spring.

== Religion, symbolism, myths and legends ==
The Nabis were influenced by the literature, music and theater of the symbolist movement, and, among some of the Nabis, there was a strong current of mysticism and esotericism. Their approach to their order was partly humorous and whimsical; the studio of Ranson at 25 Boulevard du Montparnasse was called their &quot;temple&quot;, Madame Ranson was termed &quot;The light of the Temple&quot;, and the original Nabi painting by Sérusier was displayed in the studio like a shrine, and titled &quot;The Talisman&quot;. Sérusier whimsically painted Paul Ranson in a sort of Nabic robe, with a staff and a text before him. However, they also had a more serious side. They rejected the materialism of the new industrial age, and admired the poetry of Baudelaire, Mallarmé and Edgar Allan Poe. They placed themselves in opposition to the current of naturalism expressed in the paintings of Courbet and Manet and the literature of Émile Zola.

Maurice Denis and Paul Sérusier were the Nabis who most often painted religious subjects. The work of Denis was influenced by the paintings of Fra Angelico. He often painted scenes and themes taken from the Bible, but with the figures in modern costume, in simplified landscapes and surrounded by light, a symbol of faith. In 1895, he received a commission for a series of seven large paintings called &quot;The Legend of Saint Hubert&quot; for the Paris home of Baron Cochin. They illustrated the story of Saint Hubert hunting in the forest of Aquitaine, seeing a vision of Christ, and being converted to Christianity.

Paul Sérusier painted less Christian and more mystical scenes, particularly &quot;La Vision pros du torrent&quot; or &quot;The rendezvous of fairies&quot; (1897), showing a group of women in Breton costumes passing through the forest, carrying bouquets of flowers to a ceremony, and &quot;Femmes à la Source&quot;, depicting a series of women solemnly descending through a mystical forest to a spring. This illustrates the legend of the Danaides, who in mythology were condemned to fill and refill leaking jugs of water from a spring. He painted several works of women in Breton costumes conducting pagan ceremonies in the forests of Brittany.

==Interiors==
The Nabis Pierre Bonnard, Félix Vallotton and Édouard Vuillard created particularly remarkable paintings depicting the interiors of homes, where the inhabitants of the rooms were almost entirely absorbed into the intense floral decoration and furnishings. In some of the paintings, such as Vuillard&#x27;s &quot;The Seamstress&quot; and &quot;La Table de toilet&quot; (1895), or &quot;People in an Interior - Music&quot;, it is difficult to even find and count the individuals in the painting.
==Women in the garden==
One of the most common subjects of the Nabis was women in an idyllic garden setting, usually picking flowers or fruit. It appeared in four panels representing the seasons of a young woman&#x27;s life by Maurice Denis (1890–91), painted for the bedroom of a young girl, and in the panels of women in the public parks of Paris by Édouard Vuillard (1894) painted for the residence of his patron Alexandre Nathanson; two paintings of women and children picking apples in an orchard by Pierre Bonnard (1894–96); and in a tapestry by Paul Ranson, &quot;Spring&quot;, depicting three women picking fruit. All the images are highly stylized, often using the same serpentine forms to represent the women, the trees and the foliage. The young women in the series by Denis are shown traveling along a road, dressed in vestal white in the first painting, then in different colors as they reach maturity in the final painting.
==Decorative art==
One of the stated objectives of the Nabis was to break down the barriers between art and ordinary life, and in particular the distinction between art and decoration. Much of the art they created was designed specifically to be decorative, for display in salons and dining rooms. They designed screens, murals, wallpaper, tapestries, dishware, lampshades, and ornament for furniture, as well as theater decor and costume design, and graphic design for advertising posters. Paul Ranson, working with Art Nouveau architect Henry Van de Velde made murals to decorate the dining room of art gallery owner Siegfried Bing. After a visit to the United States, where he saw the stained glass designs of Louis Comfort Tiffany and his firm, Bing invited the Nabis to submit their own designs for Tiffany glass. Roussel, Vuillard, Vallotton, Ranson, Denis, Bonnard, and Ibels all made designs, which Bing displayed in his gallery in Paris in April 1895, along with designs of non-Nabis, including Toulouse-Lautrec. In the end the windows were not made, but Maurice Denis continued to create window designs on symbolist themes, with bold designs and vivid colors. In 1895, Vuillard was commissioned to design a series of plates, which featured women in highly stylized costumes.
==Graphic arts==
Members of the Nabis worked in a variety of media, using oils on both canvas and cardboard, and distemper on canvas and wall decoration, and they also produced posters, prints, book illustrations, textiles and furniture. Considered to be on the cutting edge of modern art during their early period, their subject matter was representational (though often Symbolist in inspiration), but was design-oriented along the lines of the Japanese prints they so admired, and Art Nouveau. However, the artists of the Nabis circle were highly influenced by the paintings of the Impressionists, and thus while sharing the flatness, page layout, and negative space of art nouveau and other decorative modes, much of LesNabis&#x27; art has a painterly, non-realistic look, with color palettes reminiscent of Cézanne and Gauguin. Bonnard&#x27;s posters and lithographs are more firmly in the Art Nouveau, or Toulouse-Lautrec manner. After the turn of the century, as modern art moved towards Fauvism, Expressionism, Cubism, and Abstraction, LesNabis were viewed as conservatives and, indeed, were among the last group of artists to stick to the roots and artistic ambitions of the Impressionists, pursuing these ends almost into the middle of the 20th century. In their later years, these painters also largely abandoned their earlier interests in decorative and applied arts.
==Breakup==
In 1897, the Nabis were not present at the well-known Salon des Indépendants, but instead held their own exposition at the Galerie Vollard, more avant-garde than the Salon. Their final exhibition as a group took place in 1900 at the Galerie Bernheim, with works of Bonnard, Denis, Ibels, Maillol, Roussel, Sérusier, Vallotton and Vuillard. After that show, each of the artists went his separate way.

Looking back in 1909, Denis described the accomplishment of the Nabis. &quot;Art is no longer a visual sensation that we gather, like a photograph, as it were, of nature. No, it is a creation of our spirit, for which nature is only the occasion.&quot;

In 1937, Vuillard described the breakup of the Nabis. &quot;...The march of progress was so rapid. Society was ready to welcome cubism and surrealism before we had reached what we had imagined as our goal. We found ourselves in a way suspended in the air.&quot;

<text>Odilon Redon (born Bertrand Redon; ; 20 April 18406 July 1916) was a French Symbolist draftsman, printmaker, and painter.

Early in his career, both before and after fighting in the Franco-Prussian War, Redon worked almost exclusively in charcoal and lithography, works known as his &quot;noirs&quot;. He gained recognition after his drawings were mentioned in the 1884 novel &quot;À rebours&quot; (&quot;Against Nature&quot;) by Joris-Karl Huysmans. During the 1890s, Redon began working in pastel and oil, which quickly became his favorite medium, abandoning his previous style of &quot;noirs&quot; completely after 1900. He developed a keen interest in Hindu and Buddhist religion and culture, which increasingly showed in his work.

Redon is perhaps best known today for the dreamlike paintings created in the first decade of the 20th century, which were inspired by Japanese art and leaned toward abstraction. His work is considered a precursor to Surrealism.

==Early life==
Odilon Redon was born in Bordeaux, Aquitaine, to a prosperous family. Redon&#x27;s father made his fortune in the slave trade in Louisiana in the 1830s. Redon was conceived in New Orleans and the couple made the transatlantic journey back to France while his mother Marie Guérin, a French Creole woman, was pregnant with his brother Gaston. The young Bertrand Redon acquired the nickname &quot;Odilon&quot; from his mother&#x27;s first name, Odile. Redon started drawing as a child; at the age of ten, he was awarded a drawing prize at school. He began the formal study of drawing at fifteen but, at his father&#x27;s insistence, he changed to architecture. Failure to pass the entrance exams at Paris&#x27; École des Beaux-Arts ended any plans for a career as an architect, although he briefly studied painting there under Jean-Léon Gérôme in 1864. (His younger brother Gaston Redon would become a noted architect.)

Back in his native Bordeaux, he took up sculpting, and Rodolphe Bresdin instructed him in etching and lithography. His artistic career was interrupted in 1870 when he was drafted to serve in the army in the Franco-Prussian War until its end in 1871.

==Career==

At the end of the war, Redon moved to Paris and resumed working almost exclusively in charcoal and lithography. He called his visionary works, conceived in shades of black, his &quot;noirs&quot;. It was not until 1878 that his work gained any recognition with &quot;Guardian Spirit of the Waters&quot;; he published his first album of lithographs, titled &quot;Dans le Rêve&quot;, in 1879. Still, Redon remained relatively unknown until the appearance in 1884 of a cult novel by Joris-Karl Huysmans titled &quot;À rebours&quot; (&quot;Against Nature&quot;). The story featured a decadent aristocrat who collected Redon&#x27;s drawings.

In 1886, Redon exhibited his work with the Impressionists in their the last exhibition. The same year, he also began participating in the exhibitions of Les XX in Brussels.

In the 1890s, Redon worked in pastel and oil; he did not make &quot;noirs&quot; after 1900. In 1899, he exhibited with the Nabis at Durand-Ruel&#x27;s.

Redon had a keen interest in Hindu and Buddhist religion and culture. The figure of the Buddha increasingly showed in his work. Influences of Japonisme blended into his art, such as the painting &quot;The Death of the Buddha&quot; around 1899, &quot;The Buddha&quot; in 1906, &quot;Jacob and the Angel&quot; in 1905, and &quot;Vase with Japanese Warrior&quot; in 1905, among others.
Baron Robert de Domecy (1867–1946) commissioned Redon in 1899 to create 17 decorative panels for the dining room of the Château de Domecy-sur-le-Vault near Sermizelles in Burgundy. Redon had created large decorative works for private residences in the past, but his compositions for the château de Domecy in 1900–1901 were his most radical compositions to that point and mark the transition from ornamental to abstract painting. The landscape details do not show a specific place or space. Only details of trees, twigs with leaves, and budding flowers in an endless horizon can be seen. The colors used are mostly yellow, grey, brown and light blue. The influence of the Japanese painting style found on folding screens, &quot;byōbu&quot;, is discernible in his choice of colors and the rectangular proportions of most of the up to 2.5 metres high panels. Fifteen of them are located today in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, acquired in 1988.

Domecy also commissioned Redon to paint portraits of his wife and their daughter Jeanne, two of which are in the collections of the Musée d&#x27;Orsay and the Getty Museum in California. Most of the paintings remained in the Domecy family collection until the 1960s.


==Personal life==
At 40, Redon married Camille Falte, a young Creole from Île Bourbon. They had a son, Arï Redon (30 April 1889 – 13 May 1972 in Paris). A visual artist himself, and subject of his father&#x27;s portraiture as a child, Arï&#x27;s partner was Suzanne Redon.

Redon died on 6 July 1916 in Paris.

==Reception and interpretations of his work==

During his early years as an artist, Redon&#x27;s works were described as &quot;a synthesis of nightmares and dreams&quot;, as they contained dark, fantastical figures from the artist&#x27;s own imagination. His work represents an exploration of his internal feelings and psyche. Redon wanted to place &quot;the logic of the visible at the service of the invisible&quot;. A telling source of Redon&#x27;s inspiration and the forces behind his works can be found in his journal &quot;A Soi-même&quot; (&quot;To Myself&quot;). Of his process he wrote:

Redon&#x27;s drawings are characterized as mysterious and evocative by Joris-Karl Huysmans in the following passage from the novel &quot;À rebours&quot; (1884):

The art historian Michael Gibson says that Redon began to want his works, even the ones darker in colour and subject matter, to portray &quot;the triumph of light over darkness.&quot;

Redon described his work as ambiguous and undefinable:

== Legacy ==

In 1903, Redon was awarded the Legion of Honour. His popularity increased when a catalogue of etchings and lithographs was published by André Mellerio in 1913; that same year, he was given the largest single representation at the groundbreaking US International Exhibition of Modern Art (aka Armory Show), in New York City, Chicago and Boston.

His choice of color and subject matter in the second part of his career led to Redon being considered a precursor to Dadaism and Surrealism. According to Surrealist André Masson, Redon&#x27;s use of bright colors in his flower pastels, as well as his choice of depicting uncommon or imaginary species renders his works &quot;released from stylized naturalism&quot;, thus demonstrating the &quot;endless possibilities of lyrical chromatics&quot;.

In 1923, Mellerio published &quot;Odilon Redon: Peintre Dessinateur et Graveur&quot;. An archive of Mellerio&#x27;s papers is held by the Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago.

Redon was the inspiration for Guy Maddin&#x27;s 1995 short film &quot;Odilon Redon, or The Eye Like a Strange Balloon Mounts Toward Infinity&quot;.

=== Modern exhibitions ===
In 2005, the Museum of Modern Art launched an exhibition entitled &quot;Beyond The Visible&quot;, a comprehensive overview of Redon&#x27;s work showcasing more than 100 paintings, drawings, prints and books from The Ian Woodner Family Collection. The exhibition ran from 30 October 2005 to 23 January 2006.

In 2007, the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt presented the exhibition &quot;As in a Dream&quot; with a survey of Redon&#x27;s work with more than 200 drawings, lithographs, pastels, and paintings.

The Grand Palais in Paris, France featured a vast exhibition of Redon&#x27;s art from March to June 2011 

The Fondation Beyeler in Basel, Switzerland showed a retrospective from February to May 2014.

The Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo, The Netherlands, had an exhibition with an emphasis on the role that literature and music played in Redon&#x27;s life and work, under the title &quot;La littérature et la musique&quot;. The exhibition ran from 2 June to 9 September 2018.

<text>Ītzpāpalōtl (&quot;Obsidian Butterfly&quot;) was a goddess in Aztec religion.

She was a striking skeletal warrior and death goddess and the queen of the Tzitzimimeh. She ruled over the paradise world of Tamōhuānchān, the paradise of victims of infant mortality and the place identified as where humans were created.

She is the mother of Mixcoatl and is particularly associated with the moth &quot;Rothschildia orizaba&quot; from the family Saturniidae. Some of her associations are birds and fire. However, she primarily appears in the form of the Obsidian Butterfly.
==Iconography==
Itzpapalotl&#x27;s name can either mean &quot;obsidian butterfly&quot; or &quot;clawed butterfly&quot;; the latter meaning seems most likely. It&#x27;s quite possible that clawed butterfly refers to the bat and in some instances Itzpapalotl is depicted with bat wings. However, she can also appear with clear butterfly or eagle attributes. Her wings are obsidian or tecpatl (flint) knife tipped. (In the &quot;Manuscript of 1558&quot;, Itzpapalotl is described as having &quot;blossomed into the white flint, and they took the white and wrapped it in a bundle.&quot;) She could appear in the form of a beautiful, seductive woman or terrible goddess with a skeletal head and butterfly wings supplied with stone blades. Although the identity remains inconclusive, the Zapotec deity named Goddess 2J by Alfonso Caso and Ignacio Bernal may be a Classic Zapotec form of Itzpapalotl. In many instances Goddess 2J, whose image is found on ceramic urns, is identified with bats. &quot;In folklore, bats are sometimes called &quot;black butterflies&quot;&quot;. Itzpapalotl is sometimes represented as a goddess with flowing hair holding a trophy leg. The femur is thought by some scholars to have significance as a war trophy or a sacred object in Pre-Hispanic art.

==Ritual==

Itzpapalotl is the patron of the day and associated with the stars Cozcuauhtli and Trecena 1 House in the Aztec calendar. The Trecena 1 House is one of the five western trecena dates dedicated to the cihuateteo, or women who had died in childbirth. Not only was Itzpapalotl considered one of the cihuateteo herself, but she was also one of the tzitzimime, star demons that threatened to devour people during solar eclipses.

One of the prominent aspects of the ritual surrounding Itzpapalotl relates to the creation story of the Chichimec. The ritual is illustrated in the sixteenth century document known as the Map of Cuauhtinchan No. 2. An illustration from this document shows Chichimec warriors emerging out of a seven-chambered cave behind Itzpapalotl. The deity is shown brandishing a severed leg, thought to be a symbol of battle. Beginning in the 1990s, archeologists exploring the Barranca Del Aguila region, southwest of Mexico City, have discovered caves carved to simulate the seven chambered cave, known as Chicomoztoc, from the ritual creation narrative.

==Mythology==
According to the &quot;Manuscript of 1558&quot;, section VII, Itzpapalotl was one of two divine 2-headed doe-deers (the other one being Chimalman) who temporarily transformed themselves into women in order to seduce men. Itzpapalotl approached the two &quot;cloud serpents named Xiuhnel and Mimich &quot;, who transformed themselves into men (so as to disguise themselves when all the others of the Centzonmimixcoa had been slain in the ambush?). To Xiuhnel, Itzpapalotl said &quot;&#x27;Drink, Xiuhnel.&#x27; Xiuhnel drank the blood and then immediately lay down with her. Suddenly she ... devoured him, tore open his breast. ... Then Mimich ... ran and ... descended into a thorny barrel cactus, fell into it, and the woman fell down after him.&quot; In the myth-history narrative of the Annales de Cuauhtitlan, the cloud deity victims take the form of deer, the hearts of whom are eaten by Itzpapalotl. The theme of the heart devouring goddess appears in other global mythologies.

==Influence on modern culture==

* Orizaba the Moth Fairy, a villain in &quot;Elena of Avalor&quot;, was inspired by Itzpapalotl.
* Beyond pop culture, the name of the goddess has been used to name formations, the Itzpapalotl Tessera, on the planet Venus which are being studied for our knowledge of the geological history of our planet.
* Additionally, the goddess is one of the Pre-Columbian motifs found in California Chicano Literature.
* Ītzpāpalōtl also features prominently in the novel &quot;Obsidian Butterfly&quot;, the ninth book in the Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series by Laurell K. Hamilton.
* She was also the monster in &quot;No One Gets Out Alive&quot;, a movie on Netflix.
* She appears in &quot;Victor and Valentino&quot; in disguise based on the folklore.
* She appears in the American fantasy horror TV series, &quot;From Dusk till Dawn: The Series&quot;, under the guise as La Llorona.
* She will be the main antagonist in the upcoming Mexican animated film &quot;The Mark of the Jaguar&quot;.
* Citlali&#x27;s Passive Skill &quot;Itzpapalotl&#x27;s Star Garments&quot; named after this mythology in &quot;Genshin Impact&quot;.

<doc id="164754" wikidata="Q36092" url="?curid=164754" title="Lilo &amp; Stitch">
<text>Lilo &amp; Stitch is a 2002 American animated science fiction comedy drama film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was written and directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois in their directorial debuts and produced by Clark Spencer, based on an original story created by Sanders. It stars Daveigh Chase and Sanders as the voices of the title characters, with the voices of Tia Carrere, David Ogden Stiers, Kevin McDonald, Ving Rhames, Jason Scott Lee, Zoe Caldwell, and Kevin Michael Richardson in supporting roles. It was the second of three Disney animated feature films produced primarily at the Florida animation studio in Disney-MGM Studios at Walt Disney World near Orlando, Florida.

The film tells the story of two individuals: an orphaned Hawaiian girl named Lilo Pelekai, who is raised by her struggling older sister, Nani, after their parents&#x27; deaths, and the genetically engineered extraterrestrial creature Experiment 626, who Lilo adopts as her &quot;dog&quot; and renames &quot;Stitch&quot;. Stitch, who was designed to cause chaos and destruction, initially uses Lilo to avoid recapture by an intergalactic federation. They develop a close bond through the Hawaiian concept of &quot;ohana&quot;, or extended family, causing Stitch to reconsider his intended destructive purpose in order to keep his newfound family together.

The film is based on an idea by Sanders, who originally conceived Stitch in 1985, and the film&#x27;s design and aesthetics are based on his personal art style. Stitch was initially at the center of a children&#x27;s book Sanders had conceptualized, but later abandoned. A feature-length film starring the character entered development in 1997 when Thomas Schumacher, then the president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, approached Sanders with the objective of &quot;producing the &quot;Dumbo&quot; for our generation.&quot; The use of watercolor backgrounds hearkened back to early Disney productions such as &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937). The film and its accompanying soundtrack made extensive use of the music of Elvis Presley, while Alan Silvestri composed the film&#x27;s score.

&quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on June 16, 2002, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 21. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, humor, charm, and originality. Produced on an $80 million budget and promoted with a marketing campaign that played up its oddities, it was a box-office success, grossing over $273 million worldwide. It was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards but lost to &quot;Spirited Away&quot;. The film&#x27;s success made it a highlight of Disney&#x27;s post-animation renaissance era in the 2000s, spawning a franchise that includes three direct-to-video film sequels and three television series. A live-action adaptation is set to be released in 2025.

==Plot==

On planet Turo, the United Galactic Federation convicts scientist Dr. Jumba Jookiba of illegal genetic experimentation; he has created Experiment 626, an aggressive and near-indestructible creature with great learning capabilities. 626 is sentenced to exile on a desert asteroid, but he escapes and hijacks a space cruiser that crash-lands on Kauai, Hawaii, on the planet Earth. Shortly after landing on Earth, 626 is hit by three passing trucks and taken to an animal shelter. The Federation&#x27;s Grand Councilwoman offers Jumba an early release if he retrieves 626 with the assistance of the council&#x27;s Earth expert, Agent Pleakley.

On Kauai, orphaned teenager Nani Pelekai struggles to take care of her lonely, rambunctious younger sister, Lilo, following their parents&#x27; death in a car crash. Social worker Cobra Bubbles doubts Nani can be an adequate guardian for Lilo and threatens to place Lilo in foster care if the Pelekais&#x27; situation fails to improve. After overhearing Lilo wishing to have a friend, Nani brings her to the animal shelter to adopt a dog. Lilo adopts 626, who is impersonating a dog, and names him &quot;Stitch&quot;. That night, Stitch causes chaos at the lūau where Nani works while trying to avoid capture by Jumba and Pleakley. Nani&#x27;s boss blames Nani for the chaos, and she is fired. The news of Nani&#x27;s unemployment reaches Bubbles, who orders Nani to find a new job and tells Lilo to teach Stitch to be a &quot;model citizen&quot;.

Despite Lilo&#x27;s attempts to domesticate Stitch, his antics repeatedly ruin Nani&#x27;s efforts to find a new job. While Nani, Lilo, and Stitch go surfing with Nani&#x27;s former co-worker and friend David, Jumba and Pleakley again attempt to capture Stitch and unintentionally drag Lilo underwater in the process. David rescues Lilo and Stitch, but Bubbles, having observed the mishap, tells Nani he will retrieve Lilo the following morning. Feeling guilty for causing so much trouble, Stitch runs away. The Grand Councilwoman fires Jumba and Pleakley and tasks her second-in-command, Captain Gantu, with capturing Stitch, while Jumba begins hunting Stitch using less covert methods. When David informs Nani of another job opportunity, Nani leaves Lilo at home alone. Jumba and Pleakley chase Stitch back to the Pelekais&#x27; house. The ensuing fight between Jumba and Stitch culminates in an explosion that destroys the house.

Nani gets the job but frantically returns home after seeing a fire engine driving toward her house. Bubbles arrives to retrieve Lilo. While Bubbles and Nani argue about Lilo&#x27;s well-being, Lilo runs away into the woods and encounters Stitch, who reveals his alien identity just moments before Gantu captures them both. Stitch manages to escape just as Gantu&#x27;s ship takes off. Nani confronts Stitch, but Jumba and Pleakley immediately capture him. Nani asks them to save Lilo, but they insist they only have legal authority to capture Stitch. As Nani breaks down, Stitch remembers &quot;ohana&quot;, a term for &quot;family&quot; he learned from Lilo, and convinces Jumba to help rescue her. Jumba, Pleakley, Stitch, and Nani board Jumba&#x27;s spaceship, pursue Gantu and rescue Lilo.

The Grand Councilwoman arrives to retrieve Stitch herself. She fires Gantu for endangering Lilo and failing to capture Stitch. However, after observing Stitch&#x27;s civilized behavior and being informed that Lilo legally owns Stitch because she bought him at the animal shelter, the Grand Councilwoman decrees that Stitch will live out his exile on Earth and that the Pelekai family has the protection of the United Galactic Federation. Bubbles reveals he is a former CIA agent who had previously met the Grand Councilwoman in Roswell, New Mexico in 1973. Stitch, Jumba, and Pleakley, having joined Lilo and Nani&#x27;s family, rebuild their house with David and Bubbles&#x27; help.

==Production==
===Development===

In 1985, after graduating from California Institute of the Arts, Chris Sanders had created the character of Stitch for an unsuccessful children&#x27;s book pitch. He said, &quot;I wanted to do a children&#x27;s book about this little creature that lived in a forest. It was a bit of a monster with no real explanation as to where it came from.&quot; But he found it difficult to condense the story and abandoned the project. In 1987, Walt Disney Feature Animation hired him for their newly formed visual development department. His first project was &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; (1990), but he soon transitioned into storyboarding. After that, Sanders storyboarded sequences for &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), and was promoted to Head of Story on &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998).

In 1997, several executives at Disney Feature Animation were invited to a retreat at Michael Eisner&#x27;s farm in Vermont to discuss the future animation slate beyond adapting preexisting legends, folklore or classic novels. At the retreat, Thomas Schumacher, then executive vice president of Disney Feature Animation, suggested they produce a film that would be the &quot;&quot;Dumbo&quot; for our generation&quot;, compared to the large-budget Disney animated features they had already done. Schumacher approached Sanders about producing the film, telling him: &quot;Everybody wants this next film to be you.&quot;

During a karaoke dinner at the Walt Disney World Swan Resort, Schumacher asked Sanders, &quot;Is there anything you would like to develop?&quot; Sanders remembered the children&#x27;s book project he had initially developed. At his next meeting, Sanders pitched a remote, non-urban location, with Stitch crash-landing into a forest and interacting entirely with woodland animals, being ostracized by them, and living on his own at a farm in rural Kansas. But Schumacher suggested that Stitch should interact with people instead: &quot;The animal world is already alien to us. So, if you wanna get the best contrast between this monster and the place where it lives, I would recommend you set it in a human world.&quot; Sanders would eventually, albeit inadvertently, revisit his idea of a creature bonding with animals in a forest years later with &quot;The Wild Robot&quot; (2024).

For three straight days in his Palm Springs, Florida hotel room, Sanders created a 29-page pitch book drawing conceptual sketches and outlining the film&#x27;s general story. He initially revised it by adding a boy character. But as the character of Stitch evolved, Sanders decided he needed to be contrasted with a female character: &quot;I think Stitch represented a male character so the balance would be to put him with a little girl. We wanted someone who was going to be in conflict with Stitch, and we realized a little boy might be a comrade.&quot; Sanders then glanced at a map of Hawaii on his wall, and recalling he had recently vacationed there, he relocated the story there. Not well versed in Hawaiian culture, Sanders turned to a vacation roadmap and found the names &quot;Lilo Lane&quot; and &quot;Nani&quot; there. After finishing the booklet, he shipped it to Burbank, and Schumacher approved the pitch with one condition: &quot;it has to look like you drew it.&quot;

===Writing===

Dean DeBlois, who had served as &quot;story co-head&quot; for &quot;Mulan&quot;, was brought on to co-write and co-direct &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; after Thomas Schumacher allowed him to leave production on &quot;&quot; (2001). Meanwhile, Disney executive Clark Spencer was assigned as the film&#x27;s producer. Unlike several previous and concurrent Disney Feature Animation productions, the film&#x27;s pre-production team remained relatively small and isolated from upper management until the film went into full production.

Originally, Stitch was the leader of an intergalactic gang, and Jumba was one of his former cronies summoned by the Intergalactic Council to capture Stitch. Test audience response to early versions of the film led to changing Stitch and Jumba into creation and creator.

While the animation team visited Kauai to research the locale, their tour guide explained the meaning of &quot;ohana&quot; as it applies to extended families. This concept of ohana became an important part of the movie. DeBlois recalls:

The island of Kauai had also been featured in such films as &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981) and the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; trilogy (1993–2001). Disney&#x27;s animators faced the daunting task of meshing the film&#x27;s plot, which showed the impoverished and dysfunctional life that many Hawaiians lived during the then-recent economic downturn, with the island&#x27;s serene beauty. The actors voicing the film&#x27;s young adults, Nani and David, were Tia Carrere, a local of Honolulu, and Jason Scott Lee, who is of Hawaiian descent and grew up in Hawaii. Both Carrere and Lee assisted with rewriting their characters&#x27; dialogue in proper colloquial dialect, and with adding Hawaiian slang terms.

One innovative and unique aspect of the film is its strong focus on the relationship between two sisters. At the time, a central relationship between sisters as a major plot element was rare in American animated films.

===Casting===
Daveigh Chase earned the role of Lilo in the fall of 1998 against 150 other candidates.

Stitch was initially intended to be a non-verbal character, but Sanders said he realized &quot;he&#x27;d have to say a few things, so we made sure that we kept it to a minimum.&quot; Instead of hiring a professional actor to voice Stitch, DeBlois suggested Sanders take the role. According to Sanders, Stitch&#x27;s voice was the one he regularly used &quot;just to bother people at the studio. I&#x27;d call people on the phone and do that voice and annoy them.&quot;

Tia Carrere was originally considered for the title character in &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998), but lost the role to Ming-Na Wen. After learning Disney was doing a Hawaii-set film, Carrere sought a voice role and was hired to voice Nani. She spent two years recording her part in Los Angeles, Paris, and Toronto. Jason Scott Lee was cast as David after Carrere recommended him for the film.

Chris Williams, then a storyboard artist, suggested Kevin McDonald for the part of Agent Pleakley. After McDonald read for the part, he was cast. Cobra Bubbles was initially envisioned as more of a nebbish, with Jeff Goldblum in mind for the role. Goldblum declined the role, and Bubbles was reconceived as a more intimidating character. Sanders and DeBlois recalled Ving Rhames&#x27;s performance in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994) and cast him.

During the film&#x27;s early development, Ricardo Montalbán was cast as one of the villains, with his vocal performance based on the voice he used for Khan Noonien Singh in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;. However, all the lines he recorded were removed and his character was cut after the meeting that lead to the removal of Stitch&#x27;s gang from the story. Eventually the villainous role in the film would be Gantu voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson who is best known for playing villain roles in shows and movies. David Ogden Stiers (who had previously done voices for Disney in past films) was chosen to be the voice of Jumba. Australian actress Zoe Caldwell got the role of voicing the Grand Councilwoman, the leader of the United Galactic Federation.

===Design and animation===

In a deviation from several decades&#x27; worth of Disney features, Sanders and DeBlois chose to use watercolor painted backgrounds for &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;, as opposed to the traditional gouache technique. Watercolors had been used for the early Disney animated shorts, as well as the early Disney features &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937), &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940), and &quot;Dumbo&quot; (1941), but the technique had been largely abandoned by the mid-1940s in favor of less complicated media such as gouache. Sanders preferred that watercolors be used for &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; to evoke both the bright look of a storybook and the art direction of &quot;Dumbo&quot;, requiring the background artists to be trained in working with the medium.

The animation itself was all based on 2D work since the budget was too small for computer-generated imagery. The character designs were based on Sanders&#x27;s personal drawing style, rather than the traditional Disney in-house style. To assist the animators with adapting Sanders&#x27;s style, Sue C. Nichols, the film&#x27;s visual development supervisor, created a manual, &quot;Surfing the Sanders Style&quot;. Because of the limited budget, details like pockets or designs on clothing were avoided in the animation process, and since they could not afford to do shadows throughout much of the film, many of the scenes took place in shaded areas, saving shadows for more pivotal scenes.

The film&#x27;s extraterrestrial elements, such as the spaceships, were designed to resemble marine life, such as whales and crabs. One altered scene in the film involved Stitch, Nani, Jumba, and Pleakley hijacking a Boeing 747 jet from Lihue Airport that scrapes against buildings through downtown Honolulu. But after the September 11 attacks, with only a few weeks left in production, the climax was completely reworked to have them use Jumba&#x27;s spacecraft instead. The location was also shifted to have them fly through the mountains of Kauai. Regardless, the final design still has engines that resembled the 747&#x27;s jet engines, according to Sanders.

Even after this adjustment, the team had enough budget for about two additional minutes of animation, which was used to create the epilogue montage of Lilo, Nani, and Stitch becoming a new family.

==Release==
On June 16, 2002, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; premiered at the El Capitan Theatre. Alongside the filmmakers and Disney studio executives, Priscilla and Lisa Marie Presley, Wynonna Judd, Phil Collins, Gregory Hines, and Jodie Foster were also in attendance.

===Marketing===
Wanting Stitch to be a central part of the film&#x27;s marketing campaign, Sanders pitched a subversive idea: &quot;what if Stitch invaded other Disney properties?&quot; Dick Cook, then chairman of Walt Disney Studios, loved the idea and allowed for four parody teaser trailers to be made (nicknamed &quot;Inter-stitch-als&quot;), in which Stitch crashes memorable moments of four films from the Disney Renaissance (three of which Sanders had worked on): &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989), &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991), &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994). Most of the original actors reprised their roles in the trailers, but they were shocked when asked to act negatively toward Stitch. The trailers also include the AC/DC song &quot;Back in Black.&quot;

The marketing campaign also included several tie-in promotions, like &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; toys being offered as part of McDonald&#x27;s Happy Meals. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; trailers and television ads featured a cover of Elvis&#x27;s song &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot;, performed by Gareth Gates, who became famous on the UK TV program &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. In the U.S., &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was used for both theatrical and television trailers. The marketing campaign presented Stitch as the sort of &quot;Disney Family Black Sheep&quot;. As a promotional campaign, comics of &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; ran in &quot;Disney Adventures &quot;before the film&#x27;s release. The comics detailed events leading up to the film for both title characters, including Stitch&#x27;s creation and escape. These events were later contradicted by the sequel &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch&quot;, rendering the comics non-canonical, but the comics are notable for introducing Experiment 625, Reuben, who was a main character in the subsequent movies and TV series. Most of the comic series have been released as a collective volume, &quot;Comic Zone Volume 1: Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;.

===Home media===
&quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on December 3, 2002. During the first day of release, more than 3 million DVD copies were sold, earning $45 million in retail sales. This THX-certified DVD release features various bonus features, including a &quot;Build An Alien Experiment&quot; game, an audio commentary, music videos, deleted scenes, teaser trailers, and DVD-ROM. In 2003, a 2-disc DVD version was announced to come out along with &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1951) and &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995), which were released in 2004 and 2005. 
A 2-Disc Special Edition DVD of the film was released in Australia on November 10, 2004 and the UK on August 22, 2005, along with the UK release of &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch&quot; (2005), but a release in the US was affected by many delays. On March 24, 2009, Disney finally released the special edition DVD, called the &quot;Big Wave Edition&quot;. This DVD edition retained the original supplemental features, along with an audio commentary, a two-hour documentary, more deleted scenes, a number of behind-the-scenes featurettes, and some games.

On June 11, 2013, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; was released on Blu-ray and re-released on DVD alongside &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch 2&quot; in a &quot;2-Movie Collection&quot;, which included a single Blu-ray with both films but without bonus features, a reprint of disc one of the &quot;Big Wave Edition&quot; DVD, and a reprint of the &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch 2&quot; DVD. The &quot;2-Movie Collection&quot; has since seen two re-releases; one on January 31, 2017, containing only the Blu-ray and a code to redeem a digital download of the two films, and another on August 9, 2022, which places both films on separate Blu-ray discs that also contain most of their original DVD bonus features, the two DVDs from the first Blu-ray collection, and a digital download code as with the second Blu-ray collection.

====Altered scene====
A scene where Nani chases Lilo was modified for the UK home video release. In the original, Lilo hid in a clothes dryer, which was changed to a commode with a cabinet and pizza box used as a &quot;door&quot; to avoid influencing children to hide in dryers. The UK edit was later used for the film&#x27;s Disney+ release and the 2022 Blu-ray release.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; opened in second place earning $35.3 million in its first weekend, ranking narrowly below Tom Cruise&#x27;s &quot;Minority Report&quot;. During its second weekend, it fell to third place, behind &quot;Minority Report&quot; and &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot;. Despite the opening of &quot;Men in Black II&quot; the week after, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; remained in third place.

Meanwhile, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; continued to draw in families while other major summer blockbusters like &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; were still in wide release. Additionally, it went on to compete against the Warner Bros. live-action/animated hybrid film, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, along with Matt Damon&#x27;s action film, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;. The film earned $145.8 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $127.3 million internationally, totaling $273.1 million worldwide.

In the UK, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; collected $2.4 million during its opening weekend, ranking in first place ahead of &quot;Signs&quot; and &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot;. The film would be overtaken by &quot;Red Dragon&quot; in its second weekend.

At the end of its theatrical run, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; earned $145.8 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $127.3 million internationally, totaling $273.1 million worldwide. It became the second-highest-grossing animated film of 2002, behind 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;Ice Age&quot;. They were the only two animated films to approach the $100 million mark that year domestically. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 25 million tickets during its original run.

===Critical reaction===
&quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; received critical acclaim. Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film has an approval rating of 87% based on 149 reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Edgier than traditional Disney fare, &quot;Lilo and Stitch&quot; explores issues of family while providing a fun and charming story.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film stars out of 4, writing: &quot;It&#x27;s one of the most charming feature-length cartoons of recent years—funny, sassy, startling, original and with six songs by Elvis. It doesn&#x27;t get sickeningly sweet at the end, it has as much stuff in it for grown-ups as for kids, and it has a bright offbeat look to it.&quot; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Looser and less obviously formulaic in its fresh approach to our hearts, the brash [film] has an unleashed, subversive sense of humor that&#x27;s less corporate and more uninhibited than any non-Pixar Disney film has been in time out of mind. With its hand-drawn characters and its use of watercolors for backgrounds (the first time the studio&#x27;s done that since the 1940s), this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema&#x27;s most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable.&quot; Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine felt the film is &quot;a bright, engaging bauble with half a dozen Elvis Presley songs for Mom and Dad, and just enough sass. Stitch sticks his tongue into his nose and eats his snot to keep the tweeners giggling ...after a lag in the early sister scenes, Lilo reveals its own very American verve and wit, along with a smart story sense that marks the best animated features, traditional or computerized.&quot;

Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; noted the colors &quot;are ultra-vibrant and rich, appropriate to the Hawaiian setting. Best of all, the movie has an endearingly cheeky attitude sometimes missing from more earnest Disney tales. Witty, touching and well paced, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; is ideal family fare, but little more.&quot; Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; also praised the film&#x27;s use of watercolors, writing it is &quot;appealing. It&#x27;s easy, rather than flashy, on the eyes. And there&#x27;s some sort of relief in that, in this world of hyper-powerful computer-generated imagery.&quot; Owen Gleiberman, reviewing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, argued the &quot;animation in &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; has an engaging retro-simple vivacity, and it&#x27;s nice to see a movie for tots make use of Elvis Presley, but the story is witless and oddly defanged. Stitch gets discovered by Lilo, a temperamental Hawaiian girl who&#x27;s the whiniest of whiny brats. These two become friends in theory only: There&#x27;s so little connection between them that just about the only thing sustaining the movie is its vague &quot;E.T.&quot; outline.&quot;

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; felt Sanders and DeBlois &quot;keep things moving briskly while commendably avoiding any special sentimental &#x27;We Are a Village&#x27; point-making, despite the obvious opportunity. Character designs are familiar enough, but backgrounds possess an unusual pastel quality that gives the film an inviting atmosphere all its own.&quot; In contrast, Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Gate&quot; felt &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; was more appropriate for a television series, writing the directors &quot;find themselves locked into the structure of a feature film. They&#x27;re forced to tell the story of Lilo and Stitch&#x27;s relationship, to give it shape and a sense of arrival. Since this is a kid&#x27;s movie, the relationship can only head in the direction of schmaltz. So the promising anarchy of the first 10 or 15 minutes is suppressed.&quot;

Peter M. Nichols states that through the character of Nani and her struggles, the film appeals to older children better than such attempts by the studio to do so as &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;.

==Soundtrack==


Lilo &amp; Stitch: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack is the soundtrack to Disney&#x27;s 2002 animated feature &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;. It was released by Walt Disney Records on June 11, 2002, on Audio CD and Compact Cassette.

The soundtrack contains two original songs from the film written by Mark Kealiʻi Hoʻomalu and Alan Silvestri (the film&#x27;s composer), and performed by Kealiʻi Hoʻomalu and the Kamehameha Schools children&#x27;s chorus. It also contains five songs by American singer Elvis Presley, and two of his songs re-recorded by contemporary artists. These songs were performed by American singer Wynonna (&quot;Burning Love&quot;) and Swedish group A-Teens (&quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love&quot;).

On June 23, 2003, the soundtrack album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of 1 million units. On March 17, 2023, the song &quot;Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride&quot; received Platinum certification from the RIAA for reaching 1 million certified units.

&quot;Baby You Belong&quot; by Faith Hill was used as the theme song in the Japanese version. In North America the song was simply an album track with no connotation to the film.

==Legacy==
===Spin-off media===

On August 26, 2003, Disney released a direct-to-video sequel, &quot;Stitch! The Movie&quot;, which served as the pilot to a television series titled &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&quot;. This series ran for 65 episodes between September 20, 2003, and July 29, 2006. The series carried on where the film left off and charted Lilo and Stitch&#x27;s efforts to capture and rehabilitate Jumba&#x27;s remaining experiments. The series, as well as the original parts of the franchise that focused on Lilo Pelekai and were set in Hawaii, ended with the television film &quot;Leroy &amp; Stitch&quot;, which aired on June 23, 2006.

On August 30, 2005, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch&quot;, another direct-to-video sequel to the film, was released. In this film (set between &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; and &quot;Stitch! The Movie&quot;), Stitch has a glitch because his molecules were never fully charged (this is contrary to an original opening, &quot;Stitch&#x27;s trial&quot;, which was seen on the DVD release of &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;). Lilo wants to win the May Day hula contest like her mother did in the 1970s, but Stitch continues to have outbursts. Lilo gets increasingly mad at Stitch as his glitch causes more problems for her and ruins her chances of winning the competition. She thinks Stitch is not cooperating properly, until she finds out that Stitch is dying. The &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch&quot; DVD also contained a short film, &quot;The Origin of Stitch&quot;, that served as a bridge between &quot;Stitch Has a Glitch&quot; and &quot;Stitch! The Movie&quot;.

In March 2008, Disney announced an anime based on the &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; franchise aimed at the Japanese market titled &quot;Stitch!&quot;. The anime, which ran as a series from October 2008 to March 2011, features a Japanese girl named Yuna Kamihara in place of Lilo, and is set on a fictional island in Okinawa Prefecture instead of Hawaii. This series was produced by Madhouse for its first two seasons, and Shin-Ei Animation for its third season and two post-series specials in 2012 and 2015.

From March 27 to April 6, 2017, an English-language Chinese animated television series based on the franchise titled &quot;Stitch &amp; Ai&quot; aired in China with a Mandarin Chinese dub. It was produced by Anhui Xinhua Media and Panimation Hwakai Media. Like with the &quot;Stitch!&quot; anime, it features a local girl named Wang Ai Ling instead of Lilo, and is set in the Huangshan mountains. Unlike &quot;Stitch!&quot;, however, this series was originally produced in English in co-operation with American animators (including those who worked on &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&quot;) and then dubbed into Mandarin Chinese; the original English production aired in Southeast Asia during February 2018.

===Live-action adaptation===

In October 2018, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that Walt Disney Pictures was developing a live-action remake of &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; to be produced by &quot;Aladdin&quot; producers Dan Lin and Jonathan Eirich and written by Mike Van Waes. In November 2020, it was reported that Jon M. Chu entered talks to direct the film and that it was unclear if the film would be released in theaters or on Disney+. In July 2022, Dean Fleischer Camp replaced Chu as the film&#x27;s director. In February 2023, Zach Galifianakis joined the film. On March 31, 2023, it was announced that Maia Kealoha was cast as Lilo. Further cast members were announced that April, including Sydney Agudong as Nani, Courtney B. Vance as Bubbles, and Billy Magnussen in an undisclosed role. Kahiau Machado was originally cast as David, but was later replaced by Kaipo Dudoit. On April 21, 2023, Galifianakis was confirmed to play Jumba, and Magnussen was confirmed to play Pleakley, while Chris Sanders entered in final negotiations to return as the voice of Stitch. Tia Carrere, the original voice actress of Nani, was announced to play Mrs. Kekoa, while Amy Hill, who voiced Mrs. Hasagawa in the original, will portray a new character named Tūtū.

In August 2024, the film was shifted to a summer 2025 theatrical release. Two months later, the film was given a release date of May 23, 2025 in the United States.

===Video games===
There were three official games released in 2002 to coincide with the film: &quot;Disney&#x27;s Lilo &amp; Stitch: Trouble in Paradise&quot; for PlayStation and Microsoft Windows, &quot;Disney&#x27;s Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; for Game Boy Advance, and &quot;Disney&#x27;s Stitch: Experiment 626&quot; for PlayStation 2. Stitch is also a summonable character in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; and &quot;III&quot;, and appears along with his homeworld in &quot;Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep&quot; for the PlayStation Portable. Lilo and Stitch both appear in the Nintendo 3DS game &quot;Disney Magical World&quot; and its sequel. Stitch is also a playable character in the &quot;Disney Infinity&quot; series in the second game, &quot;Disney Infinity 2.0&quot;, and the series&#x27; third and final game, &quot;Disney Infinity 3.0&quot;. He was also a meet and greet character in &quot;&quot;. Some characters of the film are playable characters in the game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;. Stitch also appears as a playable character in the mobile game &quot;Disney Mirrorverse&quot;, and as an unlockable villager &quot;Disney Dreamlight Valley&quot;. Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, Gantu, and (from &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&quot;) Angel are playable racers in &quot;Disney Speedstorm&quot;, which also features a track environment based on the film&#x27;s depiction of Kauaʻi.

<doc id="164762" wikidata="Q743325" url="?curid=164762" title="Tamoanchan">
<text>Tamōhuānchān is a mythical location of origin known to the Mesoamerican cultures of the central Mexican region in the Late Postclassic period. In the mythological traditions and creation accounts of Late Postclassic peoples such as the Aztec, Tamoanchan was conceived as a paradise where the gods created the first of the present human race out of sacrificed blood and ground human bones which had been stolen from the Underworld of Mictlan.

==Name==
According to a figurative etymology in the &quot;Florentine Codex&quot; of Sahagún (bk. 10, ch. 29, para. 14), &quot;Tamoanchan probably means &quot;We go down to our home&quot;.
The word &quot;tamoanchan&quot; does not actually come from the Nahuatl languages, but is instead demonstrated to have its roots in Mayan etymology, with a meaning which could be glossed as &quot;place of the misty sky&quot;, or similar. Descriptions of Tamoanchan appearing in the Florentine Codex indicate that the Postclassic Nahuas thought of it being located in the humid lowlands region of the Gulf Coast of Mexico, inhabited by the Huastec Maya people.

==Depiction in codices==
When depicted in Aztec codices Tamoanchan is frequently associated with the &quot;trecena&quot; 1 Calli in the Aztec calendar. This is &quot;&quot;trecena&quot; 15 in the Borbonicus and Tonalamatl Aubin&quot;. The deity Itzpapalotl, one of the main &quot;tzitzimime&quot; figures (&quot;star demons&quot;), commonly presides over this trecena, and by extension Tamoanchan is often considered as part of her dominion.

The toponymic glyph used for Tamoanchan in the codices depicts a cleft tree, flowering and emitting blood; these motifs is the reference of the event when sexual transgression was committed in the paradise, causing the tree of life to be cut as described in the Codex Chimalpopoca. Besides being cleft, the two portions of the Tamoanchan-tree thus separated sometimes bear striping in opposite directions (as, in &quot;Codex Borgia&quot; 44) such that &quot;their diagonal position ... indicates the internal helicoidal movement.&quot; Thus, helical rotations in two opposite directions would appear to be indicated.

== Historic, earthly location ==
Besides the mythical Tamoanchan, Mexican historian and scholar of Mesoamerican belief systems Alfredo López Austin identifies several sacred sites that were historical localities associated with Tamoanchan. According to López Austin the three Tamoanchans located on earth were:

&lt;BR&gt;1) the Tamoanchan in Cuauhnahuac; 
&lt;BR&gt;2) Tamoanchan Chalchiuhmomozco mentioned by Chimalpahin Cuauhtlehuanitzin (... where Chalco Amaquemecan was later established); and 
&lt;BR&gt;3) the Tamoanchan ... mentioned in Sahagún&#x27;s work.&quot;
The first of these was where the first man and woman of the new re-peoplement were created (by Ehecatl), the &quot;new Tamoanchan cave in the Province of Cuernavaca, actually Cuauhnahuac&quot;.

The second of these was &quot;a fountain ... in which they saw a goddess and which they called &quot;chalchiuhmatlalatl&quot; (&quot;blue-green waters of chalchihuite ...&quot;) on a small hill next to Iztactepetl and Popocatepetl. ... Tamoanchan Chalchiuhmomozco was so sacred that no one could defecate there. The settlers had to travel four leagues to relieve themselves at a place called Cuitlatepec, or Cuitlatetelco, but, since they were great magicians, they flew there.&quot; [Likewise for the Otomi, &quot;Mayonikha is so sacred that no one can defecate&quot; thereat.]

The third was the site where &quot;the learned men, ... Tlaltecuin, and Xuchicahuaca, ... invented new sacred books, the count of destiny, the book of years, and the book of dreams.&quot;

<text>Saxtead Green Post Windmill is a Grade II* listed post mill at Saxtead Green, Woodbridge, Suffolk, England which is also a Scheduled monument and has been restored.

==History==

According to the Manorial Records there has been a windmill in Saxtead since 1287. The current &quot;Saxtead Green Mill&quot; dates back to at least 1796 when the miller was Amos Webber. In 1810, the Mill House was built for Robert Holmes. The mill was raised a total of three times during its working life. The mill was tailwinded c. 1853. Around this time, the sails were destroyed and remade but in 1854 Whitmore and Binyon, the Wickham Market millwrights fitted new cast iron machinery and windshaft, and the layout of the machinery changed from Head and Tail to Breast stones. It was in this year that the mill was raised for the third time. Collins, the Melton millwright worked on the mill in the 1870s and Whitmore and Binyon again worked on the mill in the 1890s. From 1926 millwright Jesse Wightman (who was initially apprenticed to A S Aldred the Miller) assisted the owner with repairs until the mill ceased working commercially on the death of the last miller in 1947.

The mill passed to Mr Steven Charles Sullivan,(1908–1997) the son-in-law of A S Aldred, who placed the mill in the guardianship of the Ministry of Works in 1951. The mill is currently owned by Stephen and Jonathan Sullivan (ensuring the Mill has been in the ownership of the same family since 1873) The mill was completely rebuilt between 1957 and 1960 under the supervision of Jesse Wightman. A replacement crowntree was obtained from a windmill at Wetheringsett which had been demolished. The mill has been in the care of English Heritage since 1984 

The mill was repaired, with a new pair of sails made in 2008.

In 2017 the mill was closed by English Heritage who undertook a 250k restoration project of the mill. Local Millwright Tim Whiting was appointed to complete the works which involved building a new set of sails and replacing the fantail. The mill was due to reopen in April 2020 but due to the Coronavirus pandemic was delayed until 2021.

==Description==

&quot;Saxtead Green Mill&quot; is a post mill with a three-storey roundhouse. The mill has four Patent sails carried on a cast-iron windshaft and is winded by a fantail. The mill has two pairs of millstones in the breast. All the machinery is of cast iron except the Brake Wheel, which is of oak.

<text>The builder pattern is a design pattern that provides a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming. The builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. It is one of the 23 classic design patterns described in the book &quot;Design Patterns&quot; and is sub-categorized as a creational pattern.

==Overview==
The builder design pattern solves problems like:
* How can a class (the same construction process) create different representations of a complex object?
* How can a class that includes creating a complex object be simplified?

Creating and assembling the parts of a complex object directly within a class is inflexible. It commits the class to creating a particular representation of the complex object and makes it impossible to change the representation later independently from (without having to change) the class.

The builder design pattern describes how to solve such problems:
* Encapsulate creating and assembling the parts of a complex object in a separate codice_1 object.
* A class delegates object creation to a codice_1 object instead of creating the objects directly.

A class (the same construction process) can delegate to different codice_1 objects to create different representations of a complex object.

==Definition==
The intent of the builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. By doing so, the same construction process can create different representations.

== Advantages ==
Advantages of the builder pattern include:
* Allows you to vary a product&#x27;s internal representation.
* Encapsulates code for construction and representation.
* Provides control over the steps of the construction process.

== Disadvantages ==
Disadvantages of the builder pattern include:
* A distinct ConcreteBuilder must be created for each type of product.
* Builder classes must be mutable.
* May hamper/complicate dependency injection.
* In many null-safe languages, the builder pattern defers compile-time errors for unset fields to runtime.

==Structure==
=== UML class and sequence diagram ===
In the above UML class diagram,
the codice_4 class doesn&#x27;t create and assemble the codice_5 and codice_6 objects directly.
Instead, the codice_4 refers to the codice_1 interface for building (creating and assembling) the parts of a complex object,
which makes the codice_4 independent of which concrete classes are instantiated (which representation is created).
The codice_10 class implements the codice_1 interface by creating and assembling the codice_5 and codice_6 objects.

The UML sequence diagram shows the run-time interactions:
The codice_4 object calls codice_15 on the codice_10 object, which creates and assembles the codice_5 object.
Thereafter,
the codice_4 calls codice_19 on codice_10, which creates and assembles the codice_6 object.

=== Class diagram ===

; Builder
: Abstract interface for creating objects (product).

; ConcreteBuilder
: Provides implementation for Builder. It is an object able to construct other objects. Constructs and assembles parts to build the objects.

== Examples ==

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Represents a product created by the builder.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public class Bicycle
 public Bicycle(string make, string model, string colour, int height)
 Make = make;
 Model = model;
 Colour = colour;
 Height = height;

 public string Make { get; set; }
 public string Model { get; set; }
 public int Height { get; set; }
 public string Colour { get; set; }

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// The builder abstraction.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public interface IBicycleBuilder
 Bicycle GetResult();

 string Colour { get; set; }
 int Height { get; set; }

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Concrete builder implementation.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public class GTBuilder : IBicycleBuilder
 public Bicycle GetResult()
 return Height == 29 ? new Bicycle(&quot;GT&quot;, &quot;Avalanche&quot;, Colour, Height) : null;

 public string Colour { get; set; }
 public int Height { get; set; }

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// The director.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public class MountainBikeBuildDirector
 private IBicycleBuilder _builder;

 public MountainBikeBuildDirector(IBicycleBuilder builder)
 _builder = builder;

 public void Construct()
 _builder.Colour = &quot;Red&quot;;
 _builder.Height = 29;

 public Bicycle GetResult()
 return this._builder.GetResult();
}

public class Client
 public void DoSomethingWithBicycles()
 var director = new MountainBikeBuildDirector(new GTBuilder());
 // Director controls the stepwise creation of product and returns the result.
 director.Construct();
 Bicycle myMountainBike = director.GetResult();
}
The Director assembles a bicycle instance in the example above, delegating the construction to a separate builder object that has been given to the Director by the Client.

<doc id="164850" wikidata="Q637921" url="?curid=164850" title="Factory method pattern">
<text>In object-oriented programming, the factory method pattern is a design pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify their exact classes. Rather than by calling a constructor, this is accomplished by invoking a factory method to create an object. Factory methods can be specified in an interface and implemented by subclasses or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by subclasses. It is one of the 23 classic design patterns described in the book &quot;Design Patterns&quot; (often referred to as the &quot;Gang of Four&quot; or simply &quot;GoF&quot;) and is subcategorized as a creational pattern.

==Overview==
The factory method design pattern solves problems such as:
* How can an object&#x27;s subclasses redefine its subsequent and distinct implementation? The pattern involves creation of a factory method within the superclass that defers the object&#x27;s creation to a subclass&#x27;s factory method.
* How can an object&#x27;s instantiation be deferred to a subclass? Create an object by calling a factory method instead of directly calling a constructor.

This enables the creation of subclasses that can change the way in which an object is created (for example, by redefining which class to instantiate).

==Definition==
According to &quot;Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software&quot;: &quot;Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.&quot;

Creating an object often requires complex processes not appropriate to include within a composing object. The object&#x27;s creation may lead to a significant duplication of code, may require information inaccessible to the composing object, may not provide a sufficient level of abstraction or may otherwise not be included in the composing object&#x27;s concerns. The factory method design pattern handles these problems by defining a separate method for creating the objects, which subclasses can then override to specify the derived type of product that will be created.

The factory method pattern relies on inheritance, as object creation is delegated to subclasses that implement the factory method to create objects.
The pattern can also rely on the implementation of an interface.

==Structure==

=== UML class diagram ===

In the above UML class diagram, the codice_1 class that requires a codice_2 object does not instantiate the codice_3 class directly. Instead, the codice_1 refers to a separate codice_5 to create a product object, which makes the codice_1 independent of the exact concrete class that is instantiated. Subclasses of codice_1 can redefine which class to instantiate. In this example, the codice_8 subclass implements the abstract codice_5 by instantiating the codice_3 class.

== Examples ==
This C++23 implementation is based on the pre C++98 implementation in the book.

import std;

enum class ProductId {MINE, YOURS};

// defines the interface of objects the factory method creates.
class Product {
public:
 virtual void print() = 0;
 virtual ~Product() = default;

// implements the Product interface.
class ConcreteProductMINE: public Product {
public:
 void print() {
 std::println(&quot;this={} print MINE&quot;, this);
};

// )implements the Product interface.
class ConcreteProductYOURS: public Product {
public:
 void print() {
 std::println(&quot;this={} print YOURS&quot;, this);
};

// declares the factory method, which returns an object of type Product.
class Creator {
public:
 virtual std::unique_ptr&lt;Product&gt; create(ProductId id) {
 if (ProductId::MINE == id) return std::make_unique&lt;ConcreteProductMINE&gt;();
 if (ProductId::YOURS == id) return std::make_unique&lt;ConcreteProductYOURS&gt;();
 // repeat for remaining products...

 return nullptr;
 virtual ~Creator() = default;

int main() {
 // The unique_ptr prevent memory leaks.
 std::unique_ptr&lt;Creator&gt; creator = std::make_unique&lt;Creator&gt;();
 std::unique_ptr&lt;Product&gt; product = creator-&gt;create(ProductId::MINE);
 product-&gt;print();

 product = creator-&gt;create(ProductId::YOURS);
 product-&gt;print();


The program output is like
this=0x6e5e90 print MINE
this=0x6e62c0 print YOURS
A maze game may be played in two modes, one with regular rooms that are only connected with adjacent rooms, and one with magic rooms that allow players to be transported at random. 

=== Structure ===
codice_11 is the base class for a final product (codice_12 or codice_13). codice_14 declares the abstract factory method to produce such a base product. codice_12 and codice_13 are subclasses of the base product implementing the final product. codice_17 and codice_18 are subclasses of codice_14 implementing the factory method producing the final products. Factory methods thus decouple callers (codice_14) from the implementation of the concrete classes. This makes the codice_21 operator redundant, allows adherence to the open–closed principle and makes the final product more flexible in the event of change.

=== Example implementations ===
====C#====
// Empty vocabulary of actual object
public interface IPerson
 string GetName();

public class Villager : IPerson
 public string GetName()
 return &quot;Village Person&quot;;
}

public class CityPerson : IPerson
 public string GetName()
 return &quot;City Person&quot;;
}

public enum PersonType
 Rural,
 Urban

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Implementation of Factory - Used to create objects.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public class PersonFactory
 public IPerson GetPerson(PersonType type)
 switch (type)
 case PersonType.Rural:
 return new Villager();
 case PersonType.Urban:
 return new CityPerson();
 default:
 throw new NotSupportedException();
 }

The above code depicts the creation of an interface called codice_22 and two implementations called codice_23 and codice_24. Based on the type passed to the codice_25 object, the original concrete object is returned as the interface codice_22.

A factory method is just an addition to the codice_25 class. It creates the object of the class through interfaces but also allows the subclass to decide which class is instantiated.
public interface IProduct
 string GetName();
 bool SetPrice(double price);

public class Phone : IProduct
 private double _price;

 public string GetName()
 return &quot;Apple TouchPad&quot;;

 public bool SetPrice(double price)
 _price = price;
 return true;
}

/* Almost same as Factory, just an additional exposure to do something with the created method */
public abstract class ProductAbstractFactory
 protected abstract IProduct MakeProduct();

 public IProduct GetObject() // Implementation of Factory Method.
 return this.MakeProduct();
}

public class PhoneConcreteFactory : ProductAbstractFactory
 protected override IProduct MakeProduct()
 IProduct product = new Phone();
 // Do something with the object after receiving it
 product.SetPrice(20.30);
 return product;
}

In this example, codice_28 is used in codice_29. As a result, codice_30 may be invoked in order to retrieve it from the codice_31. Custom logic could run after the object is obtained in the concrete factory method. codice_32 is made abstract in the factory interface.

====Java====
This Java example is similar to one in the book &quot;Design Patterns.&quot;

The codice_14 uses codice_11 but delegates the responsibility of creating codice_11 objects to its subclasses that create the concrete classes. The regular game mode could use this template method:
public abstract class Room {
 abstract void connect(Room room);

public class MagicRoom extends Room {
 public void connect(Room room) {}

public class OrdinaryRoom extends Room {
 public void connect(Room room) {}

public abstract class MazeGame {
 private final List&lt;Room&gt; rooms = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

 public MazeGame() {
 Room room1 = makeRoom();
 Room room2 = makeRoom();
 room1.connect(room2);
 rooms.add(room1);
 rooms.add(room2);

 abstract protected Room makeRoom();


The codice_14 constructor is a template method that adds some common logic. It refers to the codice_37 factory method that encapsulates the creation of rooms such that other rooms can be used in a subclass. To implement the other game mode that has magic rooms, the codice_38 method may be overridden:
public class MagicMazeGame extends MazeGame {
 @Override
 protected MagicRoom makeRoom() {
 return new MagicRoom();
}

public class OrdinaryMazeGame extends MazeGame {
 @Override
 protected OrdinaryRoom makeRoom() {
 return new OrdinaryRoom();
}

MazeGame ordinaryGame = new OrdinaryMazeGame();
MazeGame magicGame = new MagicMazeGame();
====PHP====
This PHP example shows interface implementations instead of subclassing (however, the same can be achieved through subclassing). The factory method can also be defined as codice_39and called directly by the client code (in contrast to the previous Java example).
/* Factory and car interfaces */

interface CarFactory
 public function makeCar(): Car;

interface Car
 public function getType(): string;

/* Concrete implementations of the factory and car */

class SedanFactory implements CarFactory
 public function makeCar(): Car
 return new Sedan();
}

class Sedan implements Car
 public function getType(): string
 return &#x27;Sedan&#x27;;
}

/* Client */

$factory = new SedanFactory();
$car = $factory-&gt;makeCar();
print $car-&gt;getType();
==== Python ====
This Python example employs the same as did the previous Java example.
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class MazeGame(ABC):
 def __init__(self) -&gt; None:
 self.rooms = []
 self._prepare_rooms()

 def _prepare_rooms(self) -&gt; None:
 room1 = self.make_room()
 room2 = self.make_room()

 room1.connect(room2)
 self.rooms.append(room1)
 self.rooms.append(room2)

 def play(self) -&gt; None:
 print(f&quot;Playing using {self.rooms[0]}&quot;)

 @abstractmethod
 def make_room(self):
 raise NotImplementedError(&quot;You should implement this!&quot;)
class MagicMazeGame(MazeGame):
 def make_room(self) -&gt; &quot;MagicRoom&quot;:
 return MagicRoom()
class OrdinaryMazeGame(MazeGame):
 def make_room(self) -&gt; &quot;OrdinaryRoom&quot;:
 return OrdinaryRoom()
class Room(ABC):
 def __init__(self) -&gt; None:
 self.connected_rooms = []

 def connect(self, room: &quot;Room&quot;) -&gt; None:
 self.connected_rooms.append(room)
class MagicRoom(Room):
 def __str__(self) -&gt; str:
 return &quot;Magic room&quot;
class OrdinaryRoom(Room):
 def __str__(self) -&gt; str:
 return &quot;Ordinary room&quot;
ordinaryGame = OrdinaryMazeGame()
ordinaryGame.play()

magicGame = MagicMazeGame()
magicGame.play()

<doc id="164851" wikidata="Q928696" url="?curid=164851" title="Prototype pattern">
<text>The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development. It is used when the types of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects. This pattern is used to avoid subclasses of an object creator in the client application, like the factory method pattern does, and to avoid the inherent cost of creating a new object in the standard way (e.g., using the &#x27;new&#x27; keyword) when it is prohibitively expensive for a given application.

To implement the pattern, the client declares an abstract base class that specifies a pure virtual &quot;clone()&quot; method. Any class that needs a &quot;polymorphic constructor&quot; capability derives itself from the abstract base class, and implements the &quot;clone()&quot; operation.

The client, instead of writing code that invokes the &quot;new&quot; operator on a hard-coded class name, calls the &quot;clone()&quot; method on the prototype, calls a factory method with a parameter designating the particular concrete derived class desired, or invokes the &quot;clone()&quot; method through some mechanism provided by another design pattern.

The mitotic division of a cell — resulting in two identical cells — is an example of a prototype that plays an active role in copying itself and thus, demonstrates the Prototype pattern. When a cell splits, two cells of identical genotype result. In other words, the cell clones itself.

==Overview==
The prototype design pattern is one of the 23 Gang of Four design patterns that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

The prototype design pattern solves problems like:
* How can objects be created so that the specific type of object can be determined at runtime?
* How can dynamically loaded classes be instantiated?

Creating objects directly within the class that requires (uses) the objects is inflexible because it commits the class to particular objects at compile-time and makes it impossible to specify which objects to create at run-time.

The prototype design pattern describes how to solve such problems:
* Define a codice_1 object that returns a copy of itself.
* Create new objects by copying a codice_1 object.

This enables configuration of a class with different codice_1 objects, which are copied to create new objects, and even more, codice_1 objects can be added and removed at run-time.&lt;br&gt;
See also the UML class and sequence diagram below.

==Structure==

=== UML class and sequence diagram ===

In the above UML class diagram, 
the codice_5 class refers to the codice_1 interface for cloning a codice_7.
The codice_8 class implements the codice_1 interface by creating a copy of itself.
&lt;br&gt;
The UML sequence diagram shows the run-time interactions: 
The codice_5 object calls codice_11 on a codice_12 object, which creates and returns a copy of itself (a codice_13 object).

=== UML class diagram ===
== Rules of thumb ==
Sometimes creational patterns overlap—there are cases when either prototype or abstract factory would be appropriate. At other times, they complement each other: abstract factory might store a set of prototypes from which to clone and return product objects. Abstract factory, builder, and prototype can use singleton in their implementations. Abstract factory classes are often implemented with factory methods (creation through inheritance), but they can be implemented using prototype (creation through delegation).

Often, designs start out using Factory Method (less complicated, more customizable, subclasses proliferate) and evolve toward abstract factory, prototype, or builder (more flexible, more complex) as the designer discovers where more flexibility is needed.

Prototype does not require subclassing, but it does require an &quot;initialize&quot; operation. Factory method requires subclassing, but does not require initialization.

Designs that make heavy use of the composite and decorator patterns often can benefit from Prototype as well.

A general guideline in programming suggests using the codice_11 method when creating a duplicate object during runtime to ensure it accurately reflects the original object. This process, known as object cloning, produces a new object with identical attributes to the one being cloned. Alternatively, &quot;instantiating&quot; a class using the codice_15 keyword generates an object with default attribute values.

For instance, in the context of designing a system for managing bank account transactions, it may be necessary to duplicate the object containing account information to conduct transactions while preserving the original data. In such scenarios, employing the codice_11 method is preferable over using codice_15 to instantiate a new object.

<text>In software engineering, the composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern. The composite pattern describes a group of objects that are treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object. The intent of a composite is to &quot;compose&quot; objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

==Overview==

The Composite
design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known 
&quot;GoF design patterns&quot; 
that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

===Problems the Composite design pattern can solve===

* Represent a part-whole hierarchy so that clients can treat part and whole objects uniformly.
* Represent a part-whole hierarchy as tree structure.

When defining (1) codice_1 objects and (2) codice_2 objects that act as containers for codice_1 objects, clients must treat them separately, which complicates client code.

===Solutions the Composite design pattern describes===

* Define a unified codice_4 interface for part (codice_5) objects and whole (codice_6) objects.
* Individual codice_5 objects implement the codice_4 interface directly, and codice_6 objects forward requests to their child components.

This enables clients to work through the codice_4 interface to treat codice_5 and codice_6 objects uniformly:
codice_5 objects perform a request directly,
and codice_6 objects 
forward the request to their child components recursively downwards the tree structure.
This makes client classes easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

See also the UML class and object diagram below.

== Motivation ==
When dealing with Tree-structured data, programmers often have to discriminate between a leaf-node and a branch. This makes code more complex, and therefore, more error prone. The solution is an interface that allows treating complex and primitive objects uniformly. In object-oriented programming, a composite is an object designed as a composition of one-or-more similar objects, all exhibiting similar functionality. This is known as a &quot;has-a&quot; relationship between objects. The key concept is that you can manipulate a single instance of the object just as you would manipulate a group of them. The operations you can perform on all the composite objects often have a least common denominator relationship. For example, if defining a system to portray grouped shapes on a screen, it would be useful to define resizing a group of shapes to have the same effect (in some sense) as resizing a single shape.

== When to use ==
Composite should be used when clients ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects. If programmers find that they are using multiple objects in the same way, and often have nearly identical code to handle each of them, then composite is a good choice; it is less complex in this situation to treat primitives and composites as homogeneous.

==Structure==
=== UML class and object diagram ===
In the above UML class diagram, the codice_15 class doesn&#x27;t refer to the codice_5 and codice_6 classes directly (separately).
Instead, the codice_15 refers to the common codice_4 interface and can treat codice_5 and codice_6 uniformly.
&lt;br&gt;
The codice_5 class has no children and implements the codice_4 interface directly.
&lt;br&gt;
The codice_6 class maintains a container of child
codice_4 objects (codice_26) and forwards requests
to these codice_26 (codice_28).
&lt;br&gt;

The object collaboration diagram 
shows the run-time interactions: In this example, the codice_15 object sends a request to the top-level codice_6 object (of type codice_4) in the tree structure.
The request is forwarded to (performed on) all child codice_4 objects 
(codice_5 and codice_6 objects) downwards the tree structure.&lt;br&gt;

;Defining Child-Related Operations
There are two design variants for defining and implementing child-related operations
like adding/removing a child component to/from the container (codice_35) and accessing a child component (codice_36):
* &quot;Design for uniformity:&quot; Child-related operations are defined in the codice_4 interface. This enables clients to treat codice_5 and codice_6 objects uniformly. But type safety is lost because clients can perform child-related operations on codice_5 objects.
* &quot;Design for type safety:&quot; Child-related operations are defined only in the codice_6 class. Clients must treat codice_5 and codice_6 objects differently. But type safety is gained because clients &quot;cannot&quot; perform child-related operations on codice_5 objects.

The Composite design pattern emphasizes &quot;uniformity&quot; over &quot;type safety&quot;.

=== UML class diagram ===
;Component
* is the abstraction for all components, including composite ones
* declares the interface for objects in the composition
* (optional) defines an interface for accessing a component&#x27;s parent in the recursive structure, and implements it if that&#x27;s appropriate

;Leaf
* represents leaf objects in the composition
* implements all Component methods

;Composite
* represents a composite Component (component having children)
* implements methods to manipulate children
* implements all Component methods, generally by delegating them to its children

== Variation ==
As it is described in Design Patterns, the pattern also involves including the child-manipulation methods in the main Component interface, not just the Composite subclass. More recent descriptions sometimes omit these methods.

== Example ==
This C++14 implementation is based on the pre C++98 implementation in the book.

<doc id="164854" wikidata="Q23839" url="?curid=164854" title="Decorator pattern">
<text>In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other instances of the same class. The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern as well as to the Open-Closed Principle, by allowing the functionality of a class to be extended without being modified. Decorator use can be more efficient than subclassing, because an object&#x27;s behavior can be augmented without defining an entirely new object.

==Overview== 
The &quot;decorator&quot; design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known &quot;design patterns&quot;; these describe how to solve recurring design problems and design flexible and reusable object-oriented software—that is, objects which are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

The decorator pattern provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. When using subclassing, different subclasses extend a class in different ways. However, an extension is bound to the class at compile-time and can&#x27;t be changed at run-time. The decorator pattern allows responsibilities to be added (and removed from) an object dynamcally at run-time. It is achieved by defining codice_1 objects that
* implement the interface of the extended (decorated) object (codice_2) transparently by forwarding all requests to it.
* perform additional functionality before or after forwarding a request.

This allows working with different codice_1 objects to extend the functionality of an object dynamically at run-time.

==Intent==

The decorator pattern can be used to extend (decorate) the functionality of a certain object statically, or in some cases at run-time, independently of other instances of the same class, provided some groundwork is done at design time. This is achieved by designing a new &quot;Decorator&quot; class that wraps the original class. This wrapping could be achieved by the following sequence of steps:
# Subclass the original &quot;Component&quot; class into a &quot;Decorator&quot; class (see UML diagram);
# In the &quot;Decorator&quot; class, add a &quot;Component&quot; pointer as a field;
# In the &quot;Decorator&quot; class, pass a &quot;Component&quot; to the &quot;Decorator&quot; constructor to initialize the &quot;Component&quot; pointer;
# In the &quot;Decorator&quot; class, forward all &quot;Component&quot; methods to the &quot;Component&quot; pointer; and
# In the ConcreteDecorator class, override any &quot;Component&quot; method(s) whose behavior needs to be modified.

This pattern is designed so that multiple decorators can be stacked on top of each other, each time adding a new functionality to the overridden method(s).

Note that decorators and the original class object share a common set of features. In the previous diagram, the operation() method was available in both the decorated and undecorated versions.

The decoration features (e.g., methods, properties, or other members) are usually defined by an interface, mixin (a.k.a. trait) or class inheritance which is shared by the decorators and the decorated object. In the previous example, the class &quot;Component&quot; is inherited by both the ConcreteComponent and the subclasses that descend from &quot;Decorator&quot;.

The decorator pattern is an alternative to subclassing. Subclassing adds behavior at compile time, and the change affects all instances of the original class; decorating can provide new behavior at run-time for selected objects.

This difference becomes most important when there are several &quot;independent&quot; ways of extending functionality. In some object-oriented programming languages, classes cannot be created at runtime, and it is typically not possible to predict, at design time, what combinations of extensions will be needed. This would mean that a new class would have to be made for every possible combination. By contrast, decorators are objects, created at runtime, and can be combined on a per-use basis. The I/O Streams implementations of both Java and the .NET Framework incorporate the decorator pattern.

==Motivation==

As an example, consider a window in a windowing system. To allow scrolling of the window&#x27;s contents, one may wish to add horizontal or vertical scrollbars to it, as appropriate. Assume windows are represented by instances of the &quot;Window&quot; interface, and assume this class has no functionality for adding scrollbars. One could create a subclass &quot;ScrollingWindow&quot; that provides them, or create a &quot;ScrollingWindowDecorator&quot; that adds this functionality to existing &quot;Window&quot; objects. At this point, either solution would be fine.

Now, assume one also desires the ability to add borders to windows. Again, the original &quot;Window&quot; class has no support. The &quot;ScrollingWindow&quot; subclass now poses a problem, because it has effectively created a new kind of window. If one wishes to add border support to many but not &quot;all&quot; windows, one must create subclasses &quot;WindowWithBorder&quot; and &quot;ScrollingWindowWithBorder&quot;, etc. This problem gets worse with every new feature or window subtype to be added. For the decorator solution, a new &quot;BorderedWindowDecorator&quot; is created. Any combination of &quot;ScrollingWindowDecorator&quot; or &quot;BorderedWindowDecorator&quot; can decorate existing windows. If the functionality needs to be added to all Windows, the base class can be modified. On the other hand, sometimes (e.g., using external frameworks) it is not possible, legal, or convenient to modify the base class.

In the previous example, the &quot;SimpleWindow&quot; and &quot;WindowDecorator&quot; classes implement the &quot;Window&quot; interface, which defines the &quot;draw()&quot; method and the &quot;getDescription()&quot; method that are required in this scenario, in order to decorate a window control.

== Common usecases ==
=== Applying decorators === 
Adding or removing decorators on command (like a button press) is a common UI pattern, often implemented along with the Command design pattern. For example, a text editing application might have a button to highlight text. On button press, the individual text glyphs currently selected will all be wrapped in decorators that modify their draw() function, causing them to be drawn in a highlighted manner (a real implementation would probably also use a demarcation system to maximize efficiency). 

Applying or removing decorators based on changes in state is another common use case. Depending on the scope of the state, decorators can be applied or removed in bulk. Similarly, the State design pattern can be implemented using decorators instead of subclassed objects encapsulating the changing functionality. The use of decorators in this manner makes the State object&#x27;s internal state and functionality more compositional and capable of handling arbitrary complexity.

=== Usage in Flyweight objects === 

Decoration is also often used in the Flyweight design pattern. Flyweight objects are divided into two components: an invariant component that is shared between all flyweight objects; and a variant, decorated component that may be partially shared or completely unshared. This partitioning of the flyweight object is intended to reduce memory consumption. The decorators are typically cached and reused as well. The decorators will all contain a common reference to the shared, invariant object. If the decorated state is only partially variant, then the decorators can also be shared to some degree - though care must be taken not to alter their state while they&#x27;re being used. iOS&#x27;s UITableView implements the flyweight pattern in this manner - a tableview&#x27;s reusable cells are decorators that contains a references to a common tableview row object, and the cells are cached / reused.

=== Obstacles of interfacing with decorators === 
Applying combinations of decorators in diverse ways to a collection of objects introduces some problems interfacing with the collection in a way that takes full advantage of the functionality added by the decorators. The use of an Adapter or Visitor patterns can be useful in such cases. Interfacing with multiple layers of decorators poses additional challenges and logic of Adapters and Visitors must be designed to account for that.

=== Architectural relevance === 
Decorators support a compositional rather than a top-down, hierarchical approach to extending functionality. A decorator makes it possible to add or alter behavior of an interface at run-time. They can be used to wrap objects in a multilayered, arbitrary combination of ways. Doing the same with subclasses means implementing complex networks of multiple inheritance, which is memory-inefficient and at a certain point just cannot scale. Likewise, attempting to implement the same functionality with properties bloats each instance of the object with unnecessary properties. 
For the above reasons decorators are often considered a memory-efficient alternative to subclassing. 

Decorators can also be used to specialize objects which are not subclassable, whose characteristics need to be altered at runtime (as mentioned elsewhere), or generally objects that are lacking in some needed functionality.

=== Usage in enhancing APIs === 
The decorator pattern also can augment the Facade pattern. A facade is designed to simply interface with the complex system it encapsulates, but it does not add functionality to the system. However, the wrapping of a complex system provides a space that may be used to introduce new functionality based on the coordination of subcomponents in the system. 
For example, a facade pattern may unify many different languages dictionaries under one multi-language dictionary interface. The new interface may also provide new functions for translating words between languages. 
This is a hybrid pattern - the unified interface provides a space for augmentation. Think of decorators as not being limited to wrapping individual objects, but capable of wrapping clusters of objects in this hybrid approach as well.

== Alternatives to decorators ==

As an alternative to the decorator pattern, the adapter can be used when the wrapper must respect a particular interface and must support polymorphic behavior, and the Facade when an easier or simpler interface to an underlying object is desired.

==Structure==
=== UML class and sequence diagram ===
In the above UML class diagram, 
the abstract codice_1 class maintains a reference (codice_5) 
to the decorated object (codice_2) and forwards all requests to it
(codice_7). 
This makes codice_1 transparent (invisible) to clients of codice_2.

Subclasses (codice_10,codice_11) implement additional behavior
(codice_12) that should be added to the codice_2 (before/after forwarding a request to it).

The sequence diagram 
shows the run-time interactions: The codice_14 object 
works through codice_10 and codice_11 objects to
extend the functionality of a codice_17 object.

The codice_14 calls codice_19 
on codice_10, which forwards the request to codice_11.
codice_11 performs codice_12 after forwarding 
the request to codice_17 and returns to
codice_10, which performs codice_12 
and returns to the codice_14.

 virtual void drink() override {
 callComponentDrink();
 std::print(&quot;, with {} spoons of sugar&quot;, spoons);

private:

 int spoons = 1;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { 
 std::unique_ptr&lt;Beverage&gt; soda = std::make_unique&lt;Soda&gt;();
 soda = std::make_unique&lt;IceCubes&gt;(std::move(soda), 3);
 soda = std::make_unique&lt;Sugar&gt;(std::move(soda), 1);

 soda-&gt;drink();
 std::println();
 std::unique_ptr&lt;Beverage&gt; coffee = std::make_unique&lt;Coffee&gt;();
 coffee = std::make_unique&lt;IceCubes&gt;(std::move(coffee), 16);
 coffee = std::make_unique&lt;Milk&gt;(std::move(coffee), 3.);
 coffee = std::make_unique&lt;Sugar&gt;(std::move(coffee), 2);

 coffee-&gt;drink();

 return 0;


The program output is like
Drinking Soda, with 3 ice cubes, with 1 spoons of sugar
Drinking Coffee, with 16 ice cubes, with milk of richness 3%, with 2 spoons of sugar
Full example can be tested on a godbolt page.

=== C++ ===
Two options are presented here: first, a dynamic, runtime-composable decorator (has issues with calling decorated functions unless proxied explicitly) and a decorator that uses mixin inheritance.

==== Dynamic decorator ====

import std;

struct Shape {
 virtual ~Shape() = default;

 virtual std::string getName() const = 0;

struct Circle: Shape {
 void resize(float factor) { radius *= factor; }

 std::string getName() const override {
 return std::format(&quot;A circle of radius {}&quot;, radius);

 float radius = 10.0f;

struct ColoredShape: Shape {
 ColoredShape(const std::string&amp; color, Shape&amp; shape): 
 color(color), shape(shape) {}

 std::string getName() const override {
 return std::format(&quot;{} which is colored {}&quot;, shape.getName(), color);

 std::string color;
 Shape&amp; shape;

int main() {
 Circle circle;
 ColoredShape coloredShape{&quot;red&quot;, circle};
 std::println(&quot;{}&quot;, coloredShape.getName());

import std;

struct WebPage {
 virtual void display()=0;
 virtual ~WebPage() = default;

struct BasicWebPage: WebPage {
 std::string html;
 void display() override {
 std::println(&quot;Basic WEB page&quot;);
};

struct WebPageDecorator: WebPage {
 WebPageDecorator(std::unique_ptr&lt;WebPage&gt; webPage): 
 _webPage(std::move(webPage)) {}
 void display() override {
 _webPage-&gt;display();
private:
 std::unique_ptr&lt;WebPage&gt; _webPage;

struct AuthenticatedWebPage: WebPageDecorator {
 AuthenticatedWebPage(std::unique_ptr&lt;WebPage&gt; webPage):
 WebPageDecorator(std::move(webPage))

 void authenticateUser() {
 std::println(&quot;authentification done&quot;);
 void display() override {
 authenticateUser();
 WebPageDecorator::display();
};

struct AuthorizedWebPage: WebPageDecorator {
 AuthorizedWebPage(std::unique_ptr&lt;WebPage&gt; webPage):
 WebPageDecorator(std::move(webPage))

 void authorizedUser() {
 std::println(&quot;authorized done&quot;);
 void display() override {
 authorizedUser();
 WebPageDecorator::display();
};

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
 std::unique_ptr&lt;WebPage&gt; myPage = std::make_unique&lt;BasicWebPage&gt;();

 myPage = std::make_unique&lt;AuthorizedWebPage&gt;(std::move(myPage));
 myPage = std::make_unique&lt;AuthenticatedWebPage&gt;(std::move(myPage));
 myPage-&gt;display();
 std::println();
 return 0;

==== Static decorator (mixin inheritance) ====

This example demonstrates a static Decorator implementation, which is possible due to C++ ability to inherit from the template argument.
import std;

struct Circle {
 void resize(float factor) { radius *= factor; }

 std::string getName() const {
 return std::format(&quot;A circle of radius {}&quot;, radius);

 float radius = 10.0f;

template &lt;typename T&gt;
struct ColoredShape: public T {
 ColoredShape(const std::string&amp; color): 
 color(color) {}

 std::string getName() const {
 return std::format(&quot;{} which is colored {}&quot;, T::getName(), color);

 std::string color;

int main() {
 ColoredShape&lt;Circle&gt; redCircle{&quot;red&quot;};
 std::println(&quot;{}&quot;, redCircle.getName());
 redCircle.resize(1.5f);
 std::println(&quot;{}&quot;, redCircle.getName());

=== Java ===

==== First example (window/scrolling scenario) ====
The following Java example illustrates the use of decorators using the window/scrolling scenario.
// The Window interface class
public interface Window {
 void draw(); // Draws the Window
 String getDescription(); // Returns a description of the Window

// Implementation of a simple Window without any scrollbars
class SimpleWindow implements Window {
 @Override
 public void draw() {
 // Draw window
 @Override
 public String getDescription() {
 return &quot;simple window&quot;;
}
The following classes contain the decorators for all codice_28 classes, including the decorator classes themselves.
// abstract decorator class - note that it implements Window
abstract class WindowDecorator implements Window {
 private final Window windowToBeDecorated; // the Window being decorated

 public WindowDecorator (Window windowToBeDecorated) {
 this.windowToBeDecorated = windowToBeDecorated;
 @Override
 public void draw() {
 windowToBeDecorated.draw(); //Delegation
 @Override
 public String getDescription() {
 return windowToBeDecorated.getDescription(); //Delegation
}

// The first concrete decorator which adds vertical scrollbar functionality
class VerticalScrollBarDecorator extends WindowDecorator {
 public VerticalScrollBarDecorator (Window windowToBeDecorated) {
 super(windowToBeDecorated);

 @Override
 public void draw() {
 super.draw();
 drawVerticalScrollBar();

 private void drawVerticalScrollBar() {
 // Draw the vertical scrollbar

 @Override
 public String getDescription() {
 return super.getDescription() + &quot;, including vertical scrollbars&quot;;
}

// The second concrete decorator which adds horizontal scrollbar functionality
class HorizontalScrollBarDecorator extends WindowDecorator {
 public HorizontalScrollBarDecorator (Window windowToBeDecorated) {
 super(windowToBeDecorated);

 @Override
 public void draw() {
 super.draw();
 drawHorizontalScrollBar();

 private void drawHorizontalScrollBar() {
 // Draw the horizontal scrollbar

 @Override
 public String getDescription() {
 return super.getDescription() + &quot;, including horizontal scrollbars&quot;;
}
Here&#x27;s a test program that creates a codice_28 instance which is fully decorated (i.e., with vertical and horizontal scrollbars), and prints its description:
public class DecoratedWindowTest {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 // Create a decorated Window with horizontal and vertical scrollbars
 Window decoratedWindow = new HorizontalScrollBarDecorator (
 new VerticalScrollBarDecorator (new SimpleWindow()));

 // Print the Window&#x27;s description
 System.out.println(decoratedWindow.getDescription());
}
The output of this program is &quot;simple window, including vertical scrollbars, including horizontal scrollbars&quot;. Notice how the codice_30 method of the two decorators first retrieve the decorated codice_28&#x27;s description and &quot;decorates&quot; it with a suffix.

Below is the JUnit test class for the Test Driven Development

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

import org.junit.Test;

public class WindowDecoratorTest {
 @Test
 public void testWindowDecoratorTest() {
 Window decoratedWindow = new HorizontalScrollBarDecorator(new VerticalScrollBarDecorator(new SimpleWindow()));
 // assert that the description indeed includes horizontal + vertical scrollbars
 assertEquals(&quot;simple window, including vertical scrollbars, including horizontal scrollbars&quot;, decoratedWindow.getDescription());
}

==== Second example (coffee making scenario) ====
The next Java example illustrates the use of decorators using coffee making scenario.
In this example, the scenario only includes cost and ingredients.
// The interface Coffee defines the functionality of Coffee implemented by decorator
public interface Coffee {
 public double getCost(); // Returns the cost of the coffee
 public String getIngredients(); // Returns the ingredients of the coffee

// Extension of a simple coffee without any extra ingredients
public class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {
 @Override
 public double getCost() {
 return 1;

 @Override
 public String getIngredients() {
 return &quot;Coffee&quot;;
}
The following classes contain the decorators for all classes, including the decorator classes themselves.

// Abstract decorator class - note that it implements Coffee interface
public abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
 private final Coffee decoratedCoffee;

 public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee c) {
 this.decoratedCoffee = c;

 @Override
 public double getCost() { // Implementing methods of the interface
 return decoratedCoffee.getCost();

 @Override
 public String getIngredients() {
 return decoratedCoffee.getIngredients();
}

// Decorator WithMilk mixes milk into coffee.
// Note it extends CoffeeDecorator.
class WithMilk extends CoffeeDecorator {
 public WithMilk(Coffee c) {
 super(c);

 @Override
 public double getCost() { // Overriding methods defined in the abstract superclass
 return super.getCost() + 0.5;

 @Override
 public String getIngredients() {
 return super.getIngredients() + &quot;, Milk&quot;;
}

// Decorator WithSprinkles mixes sprinkles onto coffee.
// Note it extends CoffeeDecorator.
class WithSprinkles extends CoffeeDecorator {
 public WithSprinkles(Coffee c) {
 super(c);

 @Override
 public double getCost() {
 return super.getCost() + 0.2;

 @Override
 public String getIngredients() {
 return super.getIngredients() + &quot;, Sprinkles&quot;;
}
Here&#x27;s a test program that creates a instance which is fully decorated (with milk and sprinkles), and calculate cost of coffee and prints its ingredients:
public class Main {
 public static void printInfo(Coffee c) {
 System.out.println(&quot;Cost: &quot; + c.getCost() + &quot;; Ingredients: &quot; + c.getIngredients());

 public static void main(String[] args) {
 Coffee c = new SimpleCoffee();
 printInfo(c);

 c = new WithMilk(c);
 printInfo(c);

 c = new WithSprinkles(c);
 printInfo(c);
}
The output of this program is given below:
===PHP===

abstract class Component
 protected $data;
 protected $value;

 abstract public function getData();

 abstract public function getValue();

class ConcreteComponent extends Component
 public function __construct()
 $this-&gt;value = 1000;
 $this-&gt;data = &quot;Concrete Component:\t{$this-&gt;value}\n&quot;;

 public function getData()
 return $this-&gt;data;

 public function getValue()
 return $this-&gt;value;
}

abstract class Decorator extends Component
 

class ConcreteDecorator1 extends Decorator
 public function __construct(Component $data)
 $this-&gt;value = 500;
 $this-&gt;data = $data;

 public function getData()
 return $this-&gt;data-&gt;getData() . &quot;Concrete Decorator 1:\t{$this-&gt;value}\n&quot;;

 public function getValue()
 return $this-&gt;value + $this-&gt;data-&gt;getValue();
}

class ConcreteDecorator2 extends Decorator
 public function __construct(Component $data)
 $this-&gt;value = 500;
 $this-&gt;data = $data;

 public function getData()
 return $this-&gt;data-&gt;getData() . &quot;Concrete Decorator 2:\t{$this-&gt;value}\n&quot;;

 public function getValue()
 return $this-&gt;value + $this-&gt;data-&gt;getValue();
}

class Client
 private $component;

 public function __construct()
 $this-&gt;component = new ConcreteComponent();
 $this-&gt;component = $this-&gt;wrapComponent($this-&gt;component);

 echo $this-&gt;component-&gt;getData();
 echo &quot;Client:\t\t\t&quot;;
 echo $this-&gt;component-&gt;getValue();

 private function wrapComponent(Component $component)
 $component1 = new ConcreteDecorator1($component);
 $component2 = new ConcreteDecorator2($component1);
 return $component2;
}

$client = new Client();

// Result: #quanton81

//Concrete Component: 1000
//Concrete Decorator 1: 500
//Concrete Decorator 2: 500
//Client: 2000
=== Python ===

The following Python example, taken from Python Wiki - DecoratorPattern, shows us how to pipeline decorators to dynamically add many behaviors in an object:
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Demonstrated decorators in a world of a 10x10 grid of values 0-255. 

import random
def s32_to_u16(x):
 if x &lt; 0:
 sign = 0xF000
 else:
 sign = 0
 bottom = x &amp; 0x00007FFF
 return bottom | sign
def seed_from_xy(x, y):
 return s32_to_u16(x) | (s32_to_u16(y) « 16)
class RandomSquare:
 def __init__(s, seed_modifier):
 s.seed_modifier = seed_modifier

 def get(s, x, y):
 seed = seed_from_xy(x, y) ^ s.seed_modifier
 random.seed(seed)
 return random.randint(0, 255)
class DataSquare:
 def __init__(s, initial_value=None):
 s.data = [initial_value] * 10 * 10

 def get(s, x, y):
 return s.data[(y * 10) + x] # yes: these are all 10x10

 def set(s, x, y, u):
 s.data[(y * 10) + x] = u
class CacheDecorator:
 def __init__(s, decorated):
 s.decorated = decorated
 s.cache = DataSquare()

 def get(s, x, y):
 if s.cache.get(x, y) == None:
 s.cache.set(x, y, s.decorated.get(x, y))
 return s.cache.get(x, y)
class MaxDecorator:
 def __init__(s, decorated, max):
 s.decorated = decorated
 s.max = max

 def get(s, x, y):
 if s.decorated.get(x, y) &gt; s.max:
 return s.max
 return s.decorated.get(x, y)
class MinDecorator:
 def __init__(s, decorated, min):
 s.decorated = decorated
 s.min = min

 def get(s, x, y):
 if s.decorated.get(x, y) &lt; s.min:
 return s.min
 return s.decorated.get(x, y)
class VisibilityDecorator:
 def __init__(s, decorated):
 s.decorated = decorated

 def get(s, x, y):
 return s.decorated.get(x, y)

 def draw(s):
 for y in range(10):
 for x in range(10):
 print(&quot;%3d&quot; % s.get(x, y), end=&#x27; &#x27;)
 print()
# Now, build up a pipeline of decorators:

random_square = RandomSquare(635)
random_cache = CacheDecorator(random_square)
max_filtered = MaxDecorator(random_cache, 200)
min_filtered = MinDecorator(max_filtered, 100)
final = VisibilityDecorator(min_filtered)

final.draw()
Note:

The Decorator Pattern (or an implementation of this design pattern in Python - as the above example) should not be confused with Python Decorators, a language feature of Python. They are different things.

Second to the Python Wiki:

The Decorator Pattern is a pattern described in the Design Patterns Book. It is a way of apparently modifying an object&#x27;s behavior, by enclosing it inside a decorating object with a similar interface.
This is not to be confused with Python Decorators, which is a language feature for dynamically modifying a function or class.

<doc id="164856" wikidata="Q23846" url="?curid=164856" title="Proxy pattern">
<text>In computer programming, the proxy pattern is a software design pattern. A &quot;proxy&quot;, in its most general form, is a class functioning as an interface to something else. The proxy could interface to anything: a network connection, a large object in memory, a file, or some other resource that is expensive or impossible to duplicate. In short, a proxy is a wrapper or agent object that is being called by the client to access the real serving object behind the scenes. Use of the proxy can simply be forwarding to the real object, or can provide additional logic. In the proxy, extra functionality can be provided, for example caching when operations on the real object are resource intensive, or checking preconditions before operations on the real object are invoked. For the client, usage of a proxy object is similar to using the real object, because both implement the same interface.

==Overview==
The Proxy 

design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known 
&quot;GoF design patterns&quot; 
that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

===What problems can the Proxy design pattern solve? ===

* The access to an object should be controlled.
* Additional functionality should be provided when accessing an object.

When accessing sensitive objects, for example, it should be possible to check that clients have the needed access rights.

===What solution does the Proxy design pattern describe?===

Define a separate codice_1 object that 
* can be used as a substitute for another object (codice_2), and 
* implements additional functionality to control the access to this subject.

This makes it possible to work through a codice_1 object to perform additional functionality when accessing a subject, like checking the access rights of clients accessing a sensitive object.

To act as a substitute for a subject, a proxy must implement the codice_2 interface. Clients can&#x27;t tell whether they work with a subject or its proxy.
See also the UML class and sequence diagram below.

==Structure==
=== UML class and sequence diagram ===
In the above UML class diagram, 
the codice_1 class implements the codice_2 interface so that it can act as substitute for codice_2 objects. It maintains a reference (codice_8) 
to the substituted object (codice_9) so that it can forward requests to it
(codice_10). 

The sequence diagram 
shows the run-time interactions: The codice_11 object 
works through a codice_1 object that
controls the access to a codice_9 object.
In this example, the codice_1 forwards the request to the codice_9, which performs the request.

=== Class diagram ===


== Possible usage scenarios ==
===Remote proxy===
In distributed object communication, a local object represents a remote object (one that belongs to a different address space). The local object is a proxy for the remote object, and method invocation on the local object results in remote method invocation on the remote object. An example would be an ATM implementation, where the ATM might hold proxy objects for bank information that exists in the remote server.

===Virtual proxy===

In place of a complex or heavy object, a skeleton representation may be advantageous in some cases. When an underlying image is huge in size, it may be represented using a virtual proxy object, loading the real object on demand.

===Protection proxy===
A protection proxy might be used to control access to a resource based on access rights.

<text>In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.

Four terms always associated with the command pattern are &quot;command&quot;, &quot;receiver&quot;, &quot;invoker&quot; and &quot;client&quot;. A &quot;command&quot; object knows about &quot;receiver&quot; and invokes a method of the receiver. Values for parameters of the receiver method are stored in the command. The receiver object to execute these methods is also stored in the command object by aggregation. The &quot;receiver&quot; then does the work when the codice_1 method in &quot;command&quot; is called. An &quot;invoker&quot; object knows how to execute a command, and optionally does bookkeeping about the command execution. The invoker does not know anything about a concrete command, it knows only about the command &quot;interface&quot;. Invoker object(s), command objects and receiver objects are held by a &quot;client&quot; object. The &quot;client&quot; decides which receiver objects it assigns to the command objects, and which commands it assigns to the invoker. The client decides which commands to execute at which points. To execute a command, it passes the command object to the invoker object.

Using command objects makes it easier to construct general components that need to delegate, sequence or execute method calls at a time of their choosing without the need to know the class of the method or the method parameters. Using an invoker object allows bookkeeping about command executions to be conveniently performed, as well as implementing different modes for commands, which are managed by the invoker object, without the need for the client to be aware of the existence of bookkeeping or modes.

The central ideas of this design pattern closely mirror the semantics of first-class functions and higher-order functions in functional programming languages. Specifically, the invoker object is a higher-order function of which the command object is a first-class argument.

==Overview==
The command
design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known &quot;GoF design patterns&quot; that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

Using the command design pattern can solve these problems:
* Coupling the invoker of a request to a particular request should be avoided. That is, hard-wired requests should be avoided.
* It should be possible to configure an object (that invokes a request) with a request.

Implementing (hard-wiring) a request directly into a class is inflexible because it couples the class to a particular request at compile-time, which makes it impossible to specify a request at run-time.

Using the command design pattern describes the following solution:

* Define separate (command) objects that encapsulate a request.
* A class delegates a request to a command object instead of implementing a particular request directly.

This enables one to configure a class with a command object that is used to perform a request. The class is no longer coupled to a particular request and has no knowledge (is independent) of how the request is carried out.

See also the UML class and sequence diagram below.

== Structure ==
=== UML class and sequence diagram ===
In the above UML class diagram, the codice_2 class doesn&#x27;t implement a request directly.
Instead, codice_2 refers to the codice_4 interface to perform a request (codice_5), which makes the codice_2 independent of how the request is performed.
The codice_7 class implements the codice_4 interface by performing an action on a receiver (codice_9).
The UML sequence diagram
shows the run-time interactions: The codice_2 object calls codice_1 on a codice_7 object.
codice_7 calls codice_14 on a codice_15 object,
which performs the request.

==Uses==
; GUI buttons and menu items: In Swing and Borland Delphi programming, an is a command object. In addition to the ability to perform the desired command, an may have an associated icon, keyboard shortcut, tooltip text, and so on. A toolbar button or menu item component may be completely initialized using only the object.
; Macro recording: If all user actions are represented by command objects, a program can record a sequence of actions simply by keeping a list of the command objects as they are executed. It can then &quot;play back&quot; the same actions by executing the same command objects again in sequence. If the program embeds a scripting engine, each command object can implement a method, and user actions can then be easily recorded as scripts.
; Mobile code: Using languages such as Java where code can be streamed/slurped from one location to another via URLClassloaders and Codebases the commands can enable new behavior to be delivered to remote locations (EJB Command, Master Worker).
; Multi-level undo: If all user actions in a program are implemented as command objects, the program can keep a stack of the most recently executed commands. When the user wants to undo a command, the program simply pops the most recent command object and executes its method.
; Networking: It is possible to send whole command objects across the network to be executed on the other machines, for example player actions in computer games.
; Parallel processing: Where the commands are written as tasks to a shared resource and executed by many threads in parallel (possibly on remote machines; this variant is often referred to as the Master/Worker pattern)
; Progress bars: Suppose a program has a sequence of commands that it executes in order. If each command object has a method, the program can easily estimate the total duration. It can show a progress bar that meaningfully reflects how close the program is to completing all the tasks.
; Thread pools: A typical, general-purpose thread pool class might have a public method that adds a work item to an internal queue of tasks waiting to be done. It maintains a pool of threads that execute commands from the queue. The items in the queue are command objects. Typically these objects implement a common interface such as that allows the thread pool to execute the command even though the thread pool class itself was written without any knowledge of the specific tasks for which it would be used.
; Transactional behavior: Similar to undo, a database engine or software installer may keep a list of operations that have been or will be performed. Should one of them fail, all others can be reversed or discarded (usually called &quot;rollback&quot;). For example, if two database tables that refer to each other must be updated, and the second update fails, the transaction can be rolled back, so that the first table does not now contain an invalid reference.
; Wizards: Often a wizard presents several pages of configuration for a single action that happens only when the user clicks the &quot;Finish&quot; button on the last page. In these cases, a natural way to separate user interface code from application code is to implement the wizard using a command object. The command object is created when the wizard is first displayed. Each wizard page stores its GUI changes in the command object, so the object is populated as the user progresses. &quot;Finish&quot; simply triggers a call to . This way, the command class will work.

==Terminology==
The terminology used to describe command pattern implementations is not consistent and can therefore be confusing.
This is the result of ambiguity, the use of synonyms, and implementations that may obscure the original pattern by going well beyond it.
# Ambiguity.
## The term command is ambiguous. For example, &quot;move up, move up&quot; may refer to a single (move up) command that should be executed twice, or it may refer to two commands, each of which happens to do the same thing (move up). If the former command is added twice to an undo stack, both items on the stack refer to the same command instance. This may be appropriate when a command can always be undone the same way (e.g. move down). Both the Gang of Four and the Java example below use this interpretation of the term &quot;command&quot;. On the other hand, if the latter commands are added to an undo stack, the stack refers to two separate objects. This may be appropriate when each object on the stack must contain information that allows the command to be undone. For example, to undo a &quot;delete selection&quot; command, the object may contain a copy of the deleted text so that it can be re-inserted, if the &quot;delete selection&quot; command must be undone. Note that using a separate object for each invocation of a command is also an example of the chain of responsibility pattern.
## The term execute is also ambiguous. It may refer to running the code identified by the command object&#x27;s &quot;execute&quot; method. However, in Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Presentation Foundation a command is considered to have been executed when the command&#x27;s &quot;execute&quot; method has been invoked, but that does not necessarily mean that the application code has run. That occurs only after some further event processing.
# Synonyms and homonyms.
## Client, Source, Invoker: the button, toolbar button, or menu item clicked, the shortcut key pressed by the user.
## Command Object, Routed Command Object, Action Object: a singleton object (e.g. there is only one codice_16 object), which knows about shortcut keys, button images, command text, etc. related to the command. A source or invoker object calls the Command or Action object&#x27;s execute or performAction method. The Command/Action object notifies the appropriate source/invoker objects when the availability of a command/action has changed. This allows buttons and menu items to become inactive (grayed out) when a command/action cannot be executed/performed.
## Receiver, Target Object: the object that is about to be copied, pasted, moved, etc. The receiver object owns the method that is called by the command&#x27;s &quot;execute&quot; method. The receiver is typically also the target object. For example, if the receiver object is a &quot;cursor&quot; and the method is called codice_17, then one would expect that the cursor is the target of the codice_17 action. On the other hand, if the code is defined by the command object itself, the target object will be a different object entirely.
## Command Object, routed event arguments, event object: the object that is passed from the source to the Command/Action object, to the Target object to the code that does the work. Each button click or shortcut key results in a new command/event object. Some implementations add more information to the command/event object as it is being passed from one object (e.g. codice_16) to another (e.g. document section). Other implementations put command/event objects in other event objects (like a box inside a bigger box) as they move along the line, to avoid naming conflicts. (See also chain of responsibility pattern.)
## Handler, codice_20, method, function: the actual code that does the copying, pasting, moving, etc. In some implementations the handler code is part of the command/action object. In other implementations the code is part of the Receiver/Target Object, and in yet other implementations the handler code is kept separate from the other objects.
## Command Manager, Undo Manager, Scheduler, Queue, Dispatcher, Invoker: an object that puts command/event objects on an undo stack or redo stack, or that holds on to command/event objects until other objects are ready to act on them, or that routes the command/event objects to the appropriate receiver/target object or handler code.
# Implementations that go well beyond the original command pattern.
## Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), introduces routed commands, which combine the command pattern with event processing. As a result, the command object no longer contains a reference to the target object nor a reference to the application code. Instead, invoking the command object&#x27;s &quot;execute&quot; command results in a so-called &quot;Executed Routed Event&quot; that during the event&#x27;s tunneling or bubbling may encounter a so-called &quot;binding&quot; object that identifies the target and the application code, which is executed at that point.

== Example ==
This C++14 implementation is based on the pre C++98 implementation in the book.
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;

class Command {
public:
 // declares an interface for executing an operation.
 virtual void execute() = 0;
 virtual ~Command() = default;
protected:
 Command() = default;

template &lt;typename Receiver&gt;
class SimpleCommand : public Command { // ConcreteCommand
public:
 typedef void (Receiver::* Action)();
 // defines a binding between a Receiver object and an action.
 SimpleCommand(std::shared_ptr&lt;Receiver&gt; receiver_, Action action_) :
 receiver(receiver_.get()), action(action_) { }
 SimpleCommand(const SimpleCommand&amp;) = delete; // rule of three
 const SimpleCommand&amp; operator=(const SimpleCommand&amp;) = delete;
 // implements execute by invoking the corresponding operation(s) on Receiver.
 virtual void execute() {
 (receiver-&gt;*action)();
private:
 Receiver* receiver;
 Action action;

class MyClass { // Receiver
public:
 // knows how to perform the operations associated with carrying out a request. Any class may serve as a Receiver.
 void action() {
 std::cout « &quot;MyClass::action\n&quot;;
};

int main() {
 // The smart pointers prevent memory leaks.
 std::shared_ptr&lt;MyClass&gt; receiver = std::make_shared&lt;MyClass&gt;();
 std::unique_ptr&lt;Command&gt; command = std::make_unique&lt;SimpleCommand&lt;MyClass&gt; &gt;(receiver, &amp;MyClass::action);
 command-&gt;execute();


The program output is
MyClass::action

==History==
The first published mention of using a Command class to implement interactive systems seems to be a 1985 article by Henry Lieberman. The first published description of a (multiple-level) undo-redo mechanism, using a Command class with &quot;execute&quot; and &quot;undo&quot; methods, and a history list, appears to be the first (1988) edition of Bertrand Meyer&#x27;s book Object-oriented Software Construction, section 12.2.

<text>In object-oriented programming, the iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container&#x27;s elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.

For example, the hypothetical algorithm &quot;SearchForElement&quot; can be implemented generally using a specified type of iterator rather than implementing it as a container-specific algorithm. This allows &quot;SearchForElement&quot; to be used on any container that supports the required type of iterator.
==Overview==
The Iterator

design pattern is one of the 23 well-known 
&quot;&quot;Gang of Four&quot; design patterns&quot; 
that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

===What problems can the Iterator design pattern solve?===

* The elements of an aggregate object should be accessed and traversed without exposing its representation (data structures).
* New traversal operations should be defined for an aggregate object without changing its interface.

Defining access and traversal operations in the aggregate interface is inflexible because it commits the aggregate to particular access and traversal operations and makes it impossible to add new operations
later without having to change the aggregate interface.

===What solution does the Iterator design pattern describe?===

* Define a separate (iterator) object that encapsulates accessing and traversing an aggregate object.
* Clients use an iterator to access and traverse an aggregate without knowing its representation (data structures).

Different iterators can be used to access and traverse an aggregate in different ways. 
&lt;br&gt;New access and traversal operations can be defined independently by defining new iterators.

See also the UML class and sequence diagram below.

==Definition==
The essence of the Iterator Pattern is to &quot;Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.&quot;.

== Structure ==
=== UML class and sequence diagram ===

In the above UML class diagram, the codice_1 class refers (1) to the codice_2 interface for creating an codice_3 object (codice_4) and (2) to the codice_3 interface for traversing an codice_2 object (codice_7).
The codice_8 class implements the codice_3 interface by accessing the codice_10 class.

The UML sequence diagram
shows the run-time interactions: The codice_1 object calls codice_4 on an codice_10 object, which creates an codice_8 object and returns it
to the codice_1.
The codice_1 uses then codice_8 to traverse the elements of the codice_10 object.

=== UML class diagram ===
== Example ==

Some languages standardize syntax. C++ and Python are notable examples.

=== C++ ===
C++ implements iterators with the semantics of pointers in that language. In C++, a class can overload all of the pointer operations, so an iterator can be implemented that acts more or less like a pointer, complete with dereference, increment, and decrement. This has the advantage that C++ algorithms such as codice_19 can immediately be applied to plain old memory buffers, and that there is no new syntax to learn. However, it requires an &quot;end&quot; iterator to test for equality, rather than allowing an iterator to know that it has reached the end. In C++ language, we say that an iterator models the iterator concept.

This C++11 implementation is based on chapter &quot;Generalizing vector yet again&quot;.
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;stdexcept&gt;
#include &lt;initializer_list&gt;
class Vector {
public:
 using iterator = double*;
 iterator begin() { return elem; }
 iterator end() { return elem + sz; }
 Vector(std::initializer_list&lt;double&gt; lst) :elem(nullptr), sz(0) {
 sz = lst.size();
 elem = new double[sz];
 double* p = elem;
 for (auto i = lst.begin(); i != lst.end(); ++i, ++p) {
 *p = *i;
 } 
 ~Vector() { delete[] elem; }
 int size() const { return sz; }
 double&amp; operator[](int n) {
 if (n &lt; 0 || n &gt;= sz) throw std::out_of_range(&quot;Vector::operator[]&quot;);
 return elem[n];
 Vector(const Vector&amp;) = delete; // rule of three
 Vector&amp; operator=(const Vector&amp;) = delete;
private:
 double* elem;
 int sz;

int main() {
 Vector v = {1.1*1.1, 2.2*2.2};
 for (const auto&amp; x : v) {
 std::cout « x « &#x27;\n&#x27;;
 for (auto i = v.begin(); i != v.end(); ++i) {
 std::cout « *i « &#x27;\n&#x27;;
 for (auto i = 0; i &lt;= v.size(); ++i) {
 std::cout « v[i] « &#x27;\n&#x27;;
}

The basic idea is to have a class for each symbol (terminal or nonterminal) in a specialized computer language. The syntax tree of a sentence in the language is an instance of the composite pattern and is used to evaluate (interpret) the sentence for a client. See also Composite pattern.

==Overview==
The Interpreter

design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known 
&quot;GoF design patterns&quot; 
that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

===What problems can the Interpreter design pattern solve?===

Source:

* A grammar for a simple language should be defined
* so that sentences in the language can be interpreted.

When a problem occurs very often, it could be considered to represent it as a sentence in a simple language
(Domain Specific Languages) so that an interpreter can solve the problem
by interpreting the sentence.

For example, when many different or complex search expressions must be specified.
Implementing (hard-wiring) them directly into a class is inflexible
because it commits the class to particular expressions and makes it impossible to specify new expressions or change existing ones independently from (without having to change) the class.

===What solution does the Interpreter design pattern describe?===
* Define a grammar for a simple language by defining an codice_1 class hierarchy and implementing an codice_2 operation.
* Represent a sentence in the language by an abstract syntax tree (AST) made up of codice_1 instances.
* Interpret a sentence by calling codice_2 on the AST.

The expression objects are composed recursively into a composite/tree structure that is called
&quot;abstract syntax tree&quot; (see Composite pattern).
&lt;br&gt;The Interpreter pattern doesn&#x27;t describe how
to build an abstract syntax tree. This can
be done either manually by a client or automatically by a parser.

See also the UML class and object diagram below.

== Uses ==
* Specialized database query languages such as SQL.
* Specialized computer languages that are often used to describe communication protocols.
* Most general-purpose computer languages actually incorporate several specialized languages.

=== UML class and object diagram ===
In the above UML class diagram, the codice_5 class refers to the common codice_6 interface for interpreting an expression
codice_7.
&lt;br&gt;
The codice_8 class has no children and interprets an expression directly.
&lt;br&gt;
The codice_9 class maintains a container of child expressions
(codice_10) and forwards interpret requests
to these codice_10.
&lt;br&gt;

The object collaboration diagram 
shows the run-time interactions: The codice_5 object sends an interpret request to the abstract syntax tree.
The request is forwarded to (performed on) all objects downwards the tree structure.
&lt;br&gt;The codice_9 objects (codice_14) forward the request to their child expressions.
&lt;br&gt;The codice_8 objects (codice_16) perform the interpretation directly.

<text>In software engineering, the mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern is considered to be a behavioral pattern due to the way it can alter the program&#x27;s running behavior.

In object-oriented programming, programs often consist of many classes. Business logic and computation are distributed among these classes. However, as more classes are added to a program, especially during maintenance and/or refactoring, the problem of communication between these classes may become more complex. This makes the program harder to read and maintain. Furthermore, it can become difficult to change the program, since any change may affect code in several other classes.

With the mediator pattern, communication between objects is encapsulated within a mediator object. Objects no longer communicate directly with each other, but instead communicate through the mediator. This reduces the dependencies between communicating objects, thereby reducing coupling.

==Overview==
The mediator design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known design patterns that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

===Problems that the mediator design pattern can solve===
Source:
* Tight coupling between a set of interacting objects should be avoided.
* It should be possible to change the interaction between a set of objects independently.

Defining a set of interacting objects by accessing and updating each other directly is inflexible because it tightly couples the objects to each other and makes it impossible to change the interaction independently from (without having to change) the objects.
And it stops the objects from being reusable and makes them hard to test.

&quot;Tightly coupled objects&quot; are hard to implement, change, test, and reuse because they refer to and know about many different objects.

===Solutions described by the mediator design pattern ===
* Define a separate (mediator) object that encapsulates the interaction between a set of objects.
* Objects delegate their interaction to a mediator object instead of interacting with each other directly.

The objects interact with each other indirectly through a mediator object that controls and coordinates the interaction.

This makes the objects &quot;loosely coupled&quot;. They only refer to and know about their mediator object and have no explicit knowledge of each other.

See also the UML class and sequence diagram below.

== Definition ==
The essence of the mediator pattern is to &quot;define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact&quot;. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it allows their interaction to be varied independently. Client classes can use the mediator to send messages to other clients, and can receive messages from other clients via an event on the mediator class.

==Structure==
===UML class and sequence diagram===

In the above UML class diagram, the codice_1 and codice_2 classes do not refer to (and update) each other directly.
Instead, they refer to the common codice_3 interface for controlling and coordinating interaction (codice_4), which makes them independent from one another with respect to how the interaction is carried out.
The codice_5 class implements the interaction between codice_1 and codice_2.

The UML sequence diagram shows the run-time interactions. In this example, a codice_5 object 
mediates (controls and coordinates) the interaction between codice_1 and codice_2 objects.

Assuming that codice_1 wants to interact with codice_2 (to update/synchronize its state, for example), codice_1 calls codice_14 on the codice_5 object, which gets the changed data from codice_1 and performs an codice_17 on codice_2.

Thereafter,
codice_2 calls codice_14 on the codice_5 object, which gets the changed data from codice_2 and performs an codice_23 on codice_1.

===Class diagram===
;Participants
Mediator - defines the interface for communication between &quot;Colleague&quot; objects

ConcreteMediator - implements the mediator interface and coordinates communication between &quot;Colleague&quot; objects. It is aware of all of the &quot;Colleagues&quot; and their purposes with regards to inter-communication.

Colleague - defines the interface for communication with other &quot;Colleagues&quot; through its &quot;Mediator&quot;

ConcreteColleague - implements the Colleague interface and communicates with other &quot;Colleagues&quot; through its &quot;Mediator&quot;

== Example ==

=== C# ===
The mediator pattern ensures that components are loosely coupled, such that they do not call each other explicitly, but instead do so through calls to a mediator. In the following example, the mediator registers all Components and then calls their methods.

interface IComponent
 void SetState(object state);

class Component1 : IComponent
 internal void SetState(object state)
 throw new NotImplementedException();
}

class Component2 : IComponent
 internal void SetState(object state)
 throw new NotImplementedException();
}

// Mediates the common tasks
class Mediator
 internal IComponent Component1 { get; set; }
 internal IComponent Component2 { get; set; }

 internal void ChangeState(object state)
 this.Component1.SetState(state);
 this.Component2.SetState(state);
}
A chat room could use the mediator pattern, or a system where many ‘clients’ each receive a message each time one of the other clients performs an action (for chat rooms, this would be when each person sends a message). In reality using the mediator pattern for a chat room would only be practical when used with remoting. Using raw sockets would not allow for the delegate callbacks (people subscribed to the Mediator class’ MessageReceived event).
public delegate void MessageReceivedEventHandler(string message, string sender);

public class Mediator
 public event MessageReceivedEventHandler MessageReceived;

 public void Send(string message, string sender)
 if (MessageReceived != null)
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;Sending &#x27;{0}&#x27; from {1}&quot;, message, sender);
 MessageReceived(message, sender);
 }

public class Person
 private Mediator _mediator;

 public Person(Mediator mediator, string name)
 Name = name;
 _mediator = mediator;
 _mediator.MessageReceived += new MessageReceivedEventHandler(Receive);

 public string Name { get; set; }

 private void Receive(string message, string sender)
 if (sender != Name)
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0} received &#x27;{1}&#x27; from {2}&quot;, Name, message, sender);

 public void Send(string message)
 _mediator.Send(message, Name);
}
=== Java ===
In the following example, a codice_3 object controls the values of several codice_26 objects, forcing the user code to access the stored values through the mediator. When a storage object wants to emit an event indicating that its value has changed, it also goes back to the mediator object (via the method codice_27) that controls the list of the observers (implemented using the observer pattern).
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Optional;
import java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList;
import java.util.function.Consumer;

class Storage&lt;T&gt; {
 T value;
 T getValue() {
 return value;
 void setValue(Mediator&lt;T&gt; mediator, String storageName, T value) {
 this.value = value;
 mediator.notifyObservers(storageName);
}

class Mediator&lt;T&gt; {
 private final HashMap&lt;String, Storage&lt;T» storageMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
 private final CopyOnWriteArrayList&lt;Consumer&lt;String» observers = new CopyOnWriteArrayList&lt;&gt;();
 public void setValue(String storageName, T value) {
 Storage storage = storageMap.computeIfAbsent(storageName, name -&gt; new Storage&lt;&gt;());
 storage.setValue(this, storageName, value);
 
 public Optional&lt;T&gt; getValue(String storageName) {
 return Optional.ofNullable(storageMap.get(storageName)).map(Storage::getValue);
 
 public void addObserver(String storageName, Runnable observer) {
 observers.add(eventName -&gt; {
 if (eventName.equals(storageName)) {
 observer.run();
 });
 
 void notifyObservers(String eventName) {
 observers.forEach(observer -&gt; observer.accept(eventName));
}

public class MediatorDemo {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 Mediator&lt;Integer&gt; mediator = new Mediator&lt;&gt;();
 mediator.setValue(&quot;bob&quot;, 20);
 mediator.setValue(&quot;alice&quot;, 24);
 mediator.getValue(&quot;alice&quot;).ifPresent(age -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;age for alice: &quot; + age));
 mediator.addObserver(&quot;bob&quot;, () -&gt; {
 System.out.println(&quot;new age for bob: &quot; + mediator.getValue(&quot;bob&quot;).orElseThrow(RuntimeException::new));
 mediator.setValue(&quot;bob&quot;, 21);
}

<text>In software design and engineering, the observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

It is often used for implementing distributed event-handling systems in event-driven software. In such systems, the subject is usually named a &quot;stream of events&quot; or &quot;stream source of events&quot; while the observers are called &quot;sinks of events.&quot; The stream nomenclature alludes to a physical setup in which the observers are physically separated and have no control over the emitted events from the subject/stream source. This pattern thus suits any process by which data arrives from some input that is not available to the CPU at startup, but instead may arrive at arbitrary or indeterminate times (HTTP requests, GPIO data, user input from peripherals and distributed databases, etc.).

==Overview==

The observer design pattern is a behavioural pattern listed among the 23 well-known &quot;Gang of Four&quot; design patterns that address recurring design challenges in order to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, yielding objects that are easier to implement, change, test and reuse.

The observer pattern addresses the following problems:
* A one-to-many dependency between objects should be defined without making the objects tightly coupled. 
* When one object changes state, an open-ended number of dependent objects should be updated automatically.
* An object can notify multiple other objects.

Defining a one-to-many dependency between objects by defining one object (subject) that updates the state of dependent objects directly is inflexible because it couples the subject to particular dependent objects. However, it might be applicable from a performance point of view or if the object implementation is tightly coupled (such as low-level kernel structures that execute thousands of times per second). Tightly coupled objects can be difficult to implement in some scenarios and are not easily reused because they refer to and are aware of many objects with different interfaces. In other scenarios, tightly coupled objects can be a better option because the compiler is able to detect errors at compile time and optimize the code at the CPU instruction level.

* Define codice_1 and codice_2 objects.
* When a subject changes state, all registered observers are notified and updated automatically (and probably asynchronously).

The sole responsibility of a subject is to maintain a list of observers and to notify them of state changes by calling their codice_3 operation. The responsibility of observers is to register and unregister themselves with a subject (in order to be notified of state changes) and to update their state (to synchronize their state with the subject&#x27;s state) when they are notified. This makes subject and observers loosely coupled. Subject and observers have no explicit knowledge of each other. Observers can be added and removed independently at run time. This notification-registration interaction is also known as publish-subscribe.

== Strong vs. weak reference ==

The observer pattern can cause memory leaks, known as the lapsed listener problem, because in a basic implementation, it requires both explicit registration and explicit deregistration, as in the dispose pattern, because the subject holds strong references to the observers, keeping them alive. This can be prevented if the subject holds weak references to the observers.

== Coupling and typical publish-subscribe implementations ==
Typically, the observer pattern is implemented so that the subject being observed is part of the object for which state changes are being observed (and communicated to the observers). This type of implementation is considered tightly coupled, forcing both the observers and the subject to be aware of each other and have access to their internal parts, creating possible issues of scalability, speed, message recovery and maintenance (also called event or notification loss), the lack of flexibility in conditional dispersion and possible hindrance to desired security measures. In some (non-polling) implementations of the publish-subscribe pattern, this is solved by creating a dedicated message queue server (and sometimes an extra message handler object) as an extra stage between the observer and the object being observed, thus decoupling the components. In these cases, the message queue server is accessed by the observers with the observer pattern, subscribing to certain messages and knowing (or not knowing, in some cases) about only the expected message, while knowing nothing about the message sender itself; the sender may also know nothing about the observers. Other implementations of the publish-subscribe pattern, which achieve a similar effect of notification and communication to interested parties, do not use the observer pattern. 

In early implementations of multi-window operating systems such as OS/2 and Windows, the terms &quot;publish-subscribe pattern&quot; and &quot;event-driven software development&quot; were used as synonyms for the observer pattern. 

The observer pattern, as described in the &quot;Design Patterns&quot; book, is a very basic concept and does not address removing interest in changes to the observed subject or special logic to be performed by the observed subject before or after notifying the observers. The pattern also does not deal with recording change notifications or guaranteeing that they are received. These concerns are typically handled in message-queueing systems, in which the observer pattern plays only a small part. 

Related patterns include publish–subscribe, mediator and singleton.

===Uncoupled===
The observer pattern may be used in the absence of publish-subscribe, as when model status is frequently updated. Frequent updates may cause the view to become unresponsive (e.g., by invoking many repaint calls); such observers should instead use a timer. Instead of becoming overloaded by change message, the observer will cause the view to represent the approximate state of the model at a regular interval. This mode of observer is particularly useful for progress bars, in which the underlying operation&#x27;s progress changes frequently.

==Structure==
===UML class and sequence diagram===

In this UML class diagram, the codice_1 class does not update the state of dependent objects directly. Instead, codice_1 refers to the codice_2 interface (codice_3) for updating state, which makes the codice_1 independent of how the state of dependent objects is updated. The codice_9 and codice_10 classes implement the codice_2 interface by synchronizing their state with subject&#x27;s state.

The UML sequence diagram shows the runtime interactions: The codice_9 and codice_10 objects call codice_14 on codice_15 to register themselves. Assuming that the state of codice_15 changes, codice_15 calls codice_18 on itself. codice_18 calls codice_3 on the registered codice_9 and codice_10objects, which request the changed data (codice_23) from codice_15 to update (synchronize) their state.

===UML class diagram===
==Example==
While the library classes codice_25 and codice_26 exist, they have been deprecated in Java 9 because the model implemented was quite limited.

Below is an example written in Java that takes keyboard input and handles each input line as an event. When a string is supplied from codice_27, the method codice_28 is then called in order to notify all observers of the event&#x27;s occurrence, in the form of an invocation of their update methods.

===Java===

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Scanner;

interface Observer {
 void update(String event);
 
class EventSource {
 List&lt;Observer&gt; observers = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
 public void notifyObservers(String event) {
 observers.forEach(observer -&gt; observer.update(event));
 
 public void addObserver(Observer observer) {
 observers.add(observer);
 
 public void scanSystemIn() {
 Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
 while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
 String line = scanner.nextLine();
 notifyObservers(line);
 }

public class ObserverDemo {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 System.out.println(&quot;Enter Text: &quot;);
 EventSource eventSource = new EventSource();
 eventSource.addObserver(event -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;Received response: &quot; + event));

 eventSource.scanSystemIn();
}

This is a C++11 implementation.

===JavaScript===

JavaScript has a deprecated function that was a more accurate implementation of the observer pattern. This would fire events upon change to the observed object. Without the deprecated function, the pattern may be implemented with more explicit code:
let Subject = {
 _state: 0,
 _observers: [],
 add: function(observer) {
 this._observers.push(observer);
 getState: function() {
 return this._state;
 setState: function(value) {
 this._state = value;
 for (let i = 0; i &lt; this._observers.length; i++)
 this._observers[i].signal(this);
 }

let Observer = {
 signal: function(subject) {
 let currentValue = subject.getState();
 console.log(currentValue);
}

Subject.add(Observer);
Subject.setState(10);
//Output in console.log - 10

<text>The state pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is close to the concept of finite-state machines. The state pattern can be interpreted as a strategy pattern, which is able to switch a strategy through invocations of methods defined in the pattern&#x27;s interface.

The state pattern is used in computer programming to encapsulate varying behavior for the same object, based on its internal state. This can be a cleaner way for an object to change its behavior at runtime without resorting to conditional statements and thus improve maintainability.

==Overview==

The state design pattern is one of twenty-three design patterns documented by the Gang of Four that describe how to solve recurring design problems. Such problems cover the design of flexible and reusable object-oriented software, such as objects that are easy to implement, change, test, and reuse.

The state pattern is set to solve two main problems:
* An object should change its behavior when its internal state changes.
* State-specific behavior should be defined independently. That is, adding new states should not affect the behavior of existing states.

Implementing state-specific behavior directly within a class is inflexible because it commits the class to a particular behavior and makes it impossible to add a new state or change the behavior of an existing state later, independently from the class, without changing the class. In this, the pattern describes two solutions:
* Define separate (state) objects that encapsulate state-specific behavior for each state. That is, define an interface (state) for performing state-specific behavior, and define classes that implement the interface for each state.
* A class delegates state-specific behavior to its current state object instead of implementing state-specific behavior directly.

This makes a class independent of how state-specific behavior is implemented. New states can be added by defining new state classes. A class can change its behavior at run-time by changing its current state object.

== Structure ==

In the accompanying Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram, the codice_1 class doesn&#x27;t implement state-specific behavior directly. Instead, codice_1 refers to the codice_3 interface for performing state-specific behavior (codice_4), which makes codice_1 independent of how state-specific behavior is implemented. The codice_6 and codice_7 classes implement the codice_3 interface, that is, implement (encapsulate) the state-specific behavior for each state. The UML sequence diagram shows the run-time interactions:

The codice_1 object delegates state-specific behavior to different codice_3 objects. First, codice_1 calls codice_12 on its current (initial) state object (codice_6), which performs the operation and calls codice_14 on codice_1 to change context&#x27;s current state to codice_7. The next time, codice_1 again calls codice_12 on its current state object (codice_7), which performs the operation and changes context&#x27;s current state to codice_6.

<doc id="164865" wikidata="Q775349" url="?curid=164865" title="Strategy pattern">
<text>In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives runtime instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.

Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. Strategy is one of the patterns included in the influential book &quot;Design Patterns&quot; by Gamma et al. that popularized the concept of using design patterns to describe how to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software. Deferring the decision about which algorithm to use until runtime allows the calling code to be more flexible and reusable.

For instance, a class that performs validation on incoming data may use the strategy pattern to select a validation algorithm depending on the type of data, the source of the data, user choice, or other discriminating factors. These factors are not known until runtime and may require radically different validation to be performed. The validation algorithms (strategies), encapsulated separately from the validating object, may be used by other validating objects in different areas of the system (or even different systems) without code duplication.

Typically, the strategy pattern stores a reference to code in a data structure and retrieves it. This can be achieved by mechanisms such as the native function pointer, the first-class function, classes or class instances in object-oriented programming languages, or accessing the language implementation&#x27;s internal storage of code via reflection.

== Structure ==
=== UML class and sequence diagram ===

In the above UML class diagram, the codice_1 class does not implement an algorithm directly.
Instead, codice_1 refers to the codice_3 interface for performing an algorithm (codice_4), which makes codice_1 independent of how an algorithm is implemented.
The codice_6 and codice_7 classes implement the codice_3 interface, that is, implement (encapsulate) an algorithm.
&lt;br&gt;
The UML sequence diagram
shows the runtime interactions: The codice_1 object delegates an algorithm to different codice_3 objects. First, codice_1 calls codice_12 on a codice_6 object,
which performs the algorithm and returns the result to codice_1. 
Thereafter, codice_1 changes its strategy and calls codice_12 on a codice_7 object,
which performs the algorithm and returns the result to codice_1.

=== Class diagram ===


== Strategy and open/closed principle ==

According to the strategy pattern, the behaviors of a class should not be inherited. Instead, they should be encapsulated using interfaces. This is compatible with the open/closed principle (OCP), which proposes that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

As an example, consider a car class. Two possible functionalities for car are &quot;brake&quot; and &quot;accelerate&quot;. Since accelerate and brake behaviors change frequently between models, a common approach is to implement these behaviors in subclasses. This approach has significant drawbacks; accelerate and brake behaviors must be declared in each new car model. The work of managing these behaviors increases greatly as the number of models increases, and requires code to be duplicated across models. Additionally, it is not easy to determine the exact nature of the behavior for each model without investigating the code in each.

The strategy pattern uses composition instead of inheritance. In the strategy pattern, behaviors are defined as separate interfaces and specific classes that implement these interfaces. This allows better decoupling between the behavior and the class that uses the behavior. The behavior can be changed without breaking the classes that use it, and the classes can switch between behaviors by changing the specific implementation used without requiring any significant code changes. Behaviors can also be changed at runtime as well as at design-time. For instance, a car object&#x27;s brake behavior can be changed from codice_19 to codice_20 by changing the codice_21 member to:
brakeBehavior = new Brake();


/* Encapsulated family of Algorithms
 * Interface and its implementations
public interface IBrakeBehavior {
 public void brake();

public class BrakeWithABS implements IBrakeBehavior {
 public void brake() {
 System.out.println(&quot;Brake with ABS applied&quot;);
}

public class Brake implements IBrakeBehavior {
 public void brake() {
 System.out.println(&quot;Simple Brake applied&quot;);
}

/* Client that can use the algorithms above interchangeably */
public abstract class Car {
 private IBrakeBehavior brakeBehavior;

 public Car(IBrakeBehavior brakeBehavior) {
 this.brakeBehavior = brakeBehavior;

 public void applyBrake() {
 brakeBehavior.brake();

 public void setBrakeBehavior(IBrakeBehavior brakeType) {
 this.brakeBehavior = brakeType;
}

/* Client 1 uses one algorithm (Brake) in the constructor */
public class Sedan extends Car {
 public Sedan() {
 super(new Brake());
}

/* Client 2 uses another algorithm (BrakeWithABS) in the constructor */
public class SUV extends Car {
 public SUV() {
 super(new BrakeWithABS());
}

/* Using the Car example */
public class CarExample {
 public static void main(final String[] arguments) {
 Car sedanCar = new Sedan();
 sedanCar.applyBrake(); // This will invoke class &quot;Brake&quot;

 Car suvCar = new SUV();
 suvCar.applyBrake(); // This will invoke class &quot;BrakeWithABS&quot;

 // set brake behavior dynamically
 suvCar.setBrakeBehavior( new Brake() );
 suvCar.applyBrake(); // This will invoke class &quot;Brake&quot;

<text>Märkisch-Oderland is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the eastern part of Brandenburg, Germany. Neighboring this district are (from the north clockwise) the district of Barnim, the country of Poland, the district-free city of Frankfurt (Oder), the district of Oder-Spree and the &quot;&quot; of Berlin. The administrative seat is the town of Seelow but the largest town is Strausberg.

== Geography ==

The district extends from the outskirts of Berlin in the west to the Oder river and the Polish border in the east. It includes a swampy area along the Oder known as the &quot;Oderbruch&quot;, about 60 km in length and 17 km in width. The Oderbruch was partially drained and populated in the 18th century. The rest of the district is mainly agricultural land.

== History ==
The district dates back to the district of Lebus and the district of Oberbarnim, which were both created in 1816. The district of Lebus dates back to the &quot;Land Lebus&quot;, the region around the town of Lebus. In 1863 Seelow became the seat of the administration of the district of Lebus, and in 1950 the district was renamed to &quot;Kreis Seelow&quot;. In 1952 the districts were split into three parts, the districts of Bad Freienwalde, Seelow and Strausberg. In 1993 the three parts were merged to form the current district - the new name refers to Northmarch lands at the Oder river.

== Demography ==


== Coat of arms ==

The coat of arms shows the eagle of Brandenburg in the upper half. The upper half also resembles the coat of arms of the former district of Oberbarnim. In the lower half are two boat-hooks and a star, both taken from the coat of arms of the former district of Seelow. The wavy line in the bottom represents the Oder river.

<doc id="164870" wikidata="Q4851131" url="?curid=164870" title="Balking pattern">
<text>The balking pattern is a software design pattern that only executes an action on an object when the object is in a particular state. For example, if an object reads ZIP files and a calling method invokes a get method on the object when the ZIP file is not open, the object would &quot;balk&quot; at the request. In the Java programming language, for example, an codice_1 might be thrown under these circumstances. In C# it would be codice_2.
There are some specialists in this field who consider balking more of an anti-pattern than a design pattern. If an object cannot support its API, it should either limit the API so that the offending call is not available, or so that the call can be made without limitation. It should:
* Be created in a &quot;sane state&quot;;
* not make itself available until it is in a sane state;
* become a facade and answer back an object that is in a sane state.

==Usage==
Objects that use this pattern are generally only in a state that is prone to balking temporarily but for an unknown amount of time. If objects are to remain in a state which is prone to balking for a known, finite period of time, then the guarded suspension pattern may be preferred.

==Implementation==
Below is a general, simple example for an implementation of the balking pattern. As demonstrated by the definition above, notice how the &quot;synchronized&quot; line is utilized. If there are multiple calls to the job method, only one will proceed while the other calls will return with nothing. Another thing to note is the codice_3 method. The reason it is synchronized is because the only way to guarantee another thread will see a change to a field is to synchronize all access to it. Actually, since it is a boolean variable, it could be left not explicitly synchronized, only declared volatile - to guarantee that the other thread will not read an obsolete cached value.
public class Example {
 private boolean jobInProgress = false;

 public void job() {
 synchronized(this) {
 if (jobInProgress) {
 return;
 jobInProgress = true;
 // Code to execute job goes here
 jobCompleted();

 void jobCompleted() {
 synchronized(this) {
 jobInProgress = false;
 }

<doc id="164871" wikidata="Q5614004" url="?curid=164871" title="Guarded suspension">
<text>In concurrent programming, guarded suspension is a software design pattern for managing operations that require both a lock to be acquired and a precondition to be satisfied before the operation can be executed. The guarded suspension pattern is typically applied to method calls in object-oriented programs, and involves suspending the method call, and the calling thread, until the precondition (acting as a guard) is satisfied.

==Usage==
Because it is blocking, the guarded suspension pattern is generally only used when the developer knows that a method call will be suspended for a finite and reasonable period of time. If a method call is suspended for too long, then the overall program will slow down or stop, waiting for the precondition to be satisfied. If the developer knows that the method call suspension will be indefinite or for an unacceptably long period, then the balking pattern may be preferred.

==Implementation==
In Java, the Object class provides the codice_1 and codice_2 methods to assist with guarded suspension. In the implementation below, originally found in , if there is no precondition satisfied for the method call to be successful, then the method will wait until it finally enters a valid state.
public class Example {
 synchronized void guardedMethod() {
 while (!preCondition()) {
 try {
 // Continue to wait
 wait();
 } catch (InterruptedException e) {
 }
 // Actual task implementation
 synchronized void alterObjectStateMethod() {
 // Change the object state
 // Inform waiting threads
 notify();
}
An example of an actual implementation would be a queue object with a codice_3 method that has a guard to detect when there are no items in the queue. Once the codice_4 method notifies the other methods (for example, a codice_3 method), then the codice_3 method can exit its guarded state and proceed with a call. Once the queue is empty, then the codice_3 method will enter a guarded state once again.

<doc id="164874" wikidata="Q2712542" url="?curid=164874" title="Double-checked locking">
<text>In software engineering, double-checked locking (also known as &quot;double-checked locking optimization&quot;) is a software design pattern used to reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by testing the locking criterion (the &quot;lock hint&quot;) before acquiring the lock. Locking occurs only if the locking criterion check indicates that locking is required.

The original form of the pattern, appearing in &quot;Pattern Languages of Program Design 3&quot;, has data races, depending on the memory model in use, and it is hard to get right. Some consider it to be an anti-pattern. There are valid forms of the pattern, including the use of the keyword in Java and explicit memory barriers in C++.

The pattern is typically used to reduce locking overhead when implementing &quot;lazy initialization&quot; in a multi-threaded environment, especially as part of the Singleton pattern. Lazy initialization avoids initializing a value until the first time it is accessed.

== Motivation and original pattern ==

Consider, for example, this code segment in the Java programming language:
// Single-threaded version
class Foo {
 private static Helper helper;
 public Helper getHelper() {
 if (helper == null) {
 helper = new Helper();
 return helper;

 // other functions and members...


The problem is that this does not work when using multiple threads. A lock must be obtained in case two threads call codice_1 simultaneously. Otherwise, either they may both try to create the object at the same time, or one may wind up getting a reference to an incompletely initialized object.

Synchronizing with a lock can fix this, as is shown in the following example:
// Correct but possibly expensive multithreaded version
class Foo {
 private Helper helper;
 public synchronized Helper getHelper() {
 if (helper == null) {
 helper = new Helper();
 return helper;

 // other functions and members...


This is correct and will most likely have sufficient performance. However, the first call to codice_1 will create the object and only the few threads trying to access it during that time need to be synchronized; after that all calls just get a reference to the member variable. Since synchronizing a method could in some extreme cases decrease performance by a factor of 100 or higher, the overhead of acquiring and releasing a lock every time this method is called seems unnecessary: once the initialization has been completed, acquiring and releasing the locks would appear unnecessary. Many programmers, including the authors of the double-checked locking design pattern, have attempted to optimize this situation in the following manner:

# Check that the variable is initialized (without obtaining the lock). If it is initialized, return it immediately.
# Obtain the lock.
# Double-check whether the variable has already been initialized: if another thread acquired the lock first, it may have already done the initialization. If so, return the initialized variable.
# Otherwise, initialize and return the variable.
// Broken multithreaded version
// original &quot;Double-Checked Locking&quot; idiom
class Foo {
 private Helper helper;
 public Helper getHelper() {
 if (helper == null) {
 synchronized (this) {
 if (helper == null) {
 helper = new Helper();
 }
 return helper;

 // other functions and members...


Intuitively, this algorithm is an efficient solution to the problem. But if the pattern is not written carefully, it will have a data race. For example, consider the following sequence of events:

# Thread &quot;A&quot; notices that the value is not initialized, so it obtains the lock and begins to initialize the value.
# Due to the semantics of some programming languages, the code generated by the compiler is allowed to update the shared variable to point to a &quot;partially constructed&quot; object before &quot;A&quot; has finished performing the initialization. For example, in Java if a call to a constructor has been inlined then the shared variable may immediately be updated once the storage has been allocated but before the inlined constructor initializes the object.
# Thread &quot;B&quot; notices that the shared variable has been initialized (or so it appears), and returns its value. Because thread &quot;B&quot; believes the value is already initialized, it does not acquire the lock. If &quot;B&quot; uses the object before all of the initialization done by &quot;A&quot; is seen by &quot;B&quot; (either because &quot;A&quot; has not finished initializing it or because some of the initialized values in the object have not yet percolated to the memory &quot;B&quot; uses (cache coherence)), the program will likely crash.

Most runtimes have memory barriers or other methods for managing memory visibility across execution units. Without a detailed understanding of the language&#x27;s behavior in this area, the algorithm is difficult to implement correctly. One of the dangers of using double-checked locking is that even a naive implementation will appear to work most of the time: it is not easy to distinguish between a correct implementation of the technique and one that has subtle problems. Depending on the compiler, the interleaving of threads by the scheduler and the nature of other concurrent system activity, failures resulting from an incorrect implementation of double-checked locking may only occur intermittently. Reproducing the failures can be difficult.

== Usage in C++11 ==
For the singleton pattern, double-checked locking is not needed:


Singleton&amp; GetInstance() {
 static Singleton s;
 return s;


C++11 and beyond also provide a built-in double-checked locking pattern in the form of codice_3 and codice_4:

#include &lt;mutex&gt;
#include &lt;optional&gt; // Since C++17

// Singleton.h
class Singleton {
 public:
 static Singleton* GetInstance();
 private:
 Singleton() = default;

 static std::optional&lt;Singleton&gt; s_instance;
 static std::once_flag s_flag;

// Singleton.cpp
std::optional&lt;Singleton&gt; Singleton::s_instance;
std::once_flag Singleton::s_flag{};

Singleton* Singleton::GetInstance() {
 std::call_once(Singleton::s_flag,
 []() { s_instance.emplace(Singleton{}); });
 return &amp;*s_instance;


If one truly wishes to use the double-checked idiom instead of the trivially working example above (for instance because Visual Studio before the 2015 release did not implement the C++11 standard&#x27;s language about concurrent initialization quoted above ), one needs to use acquire and release fences:
#include &lt;atomic&gt;
#include &lt;mutex&gt;

class Singleton {
 public:
 static Singleton* GetInstance();

 private:
 Singleton() = default;

 static std::atomic&lt;Singleton*&gt; s_instance;
 static std::mutex s_mutex;

Singleton* Singleton::GetInstance() {
 Singleton* p = s_instance.load(std::memory_order_acquire);
 if (p == nullptr) { // 1st check
 std::lock_guard&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock(s_mutex);
 p = s_instance.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
 if (p == nullptr) { // 2nd (double) check
 p = new Singleton();
 s_instance.store(p, std::memory_order_release);
 }
 return p;


== Usage in POSIX ==
codice_5 must be used
to initialize library (or sub-module) code when its API does not have a dedicated initialization 
procedure required to be called in single-threaded mode.

== Usage in Go ==

package main

import &quot;sync&quot;

var arrOnce sync.Once
var arr []int

// getArr retrieves arr, lazily initializing on first call. Double-checked
// locking is implemented with the sync.Once library function. The first
// goroutine to win the race to call Do() will initialize the array, while
// others will block until Do() has completed. After Do has run, only a
// single atomic comparison will be required to get the array.
func getArr() []int {
 arrOnce.Do(func() {
 arr = []int{0, 1, 2}
 return arr

func main() {
 // thanks to double-checked locking, two goroutines attempting to getArr()
 // will not cause double-initialization
 go getArr()
 go getArr()


== Usage in Java ==

As of J2SE 5.0, the volatile keyword is defined to create a memory barrier. This allows a solution that ensures that multiple threads handle the singleton instance correctly. This new idiom is described in and .
// Works with acquire/release semantics for volatile in Java 1.5 and later
// Broken under Java 1.4 and earlier semantics for volatile
class Foo {
 private volatile Helper helper;
 public Helper getHelper() {
 Helper localRef = helper;
 if (localRef == null) {
 synchronized (this) {
 localRef = helper;
 if (localRef == null) {
 helper = localRef = new Helper();
 }
 return localRef;

 // other functions and members...


Note the local variable &quot;, which seems unnecessary. The effect of this is that in cases where is already initialized (i.e., most of the time), the volatile field is only accessed once (due to &quot; instead of &quot;&quot;), which can improve the method&#x27;s overall performance by as much as 40 percent.

Java 9 introduced the class, which allows use of relaxed atomics to access fields, giving somewhat faster reads on machines with weak memory models, at the cost of more difficult mechanics and loss of sequential consistency (field accesses no longer participate in the synchronization order, the global order of accesses to volatile fields).
// Works with acquire/release semantics for VarHandles introduced in Java 9
class Foo {
 private volatile Helper helper;

 public Helper getHelper() {
 Helper localRef = getHelperAcquire();
 if (localRef == null) {
 synchronized (this) {
 localRef = getHelperAcquire();
 if (localRef == null) {
 localRef = new Helper();
 setHelperRelease(localRef);
 }
 return localRef;

 private static final VarHandle HELPER;
 private Helper getHelperAcquire() {
 return (Helper) HELPER.getAcquire(this);
 private void setHelperRelease(Helper value) {
 HELPER.setRelease(this, value);

 static {
 try {
 MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
 HELPER = lookup.findVarHandle(Foo.class, &quot;helper&quot;, Helper.class);
 } catch (ReflectiveOperationException e) {
 throw new ExceptionInInitializerError(e);
 }

 // other functions and members...


If the helper object is static (one per class loader), an alternative is the initialization-on-demand holder idiom (See Listing 16.6 from the previously cited text.)

// Correct lazy initialization in Java
class Foo {
 private static class HelperHolder {
 public static final Helper helper = new Helper();

 public static Helper getHelper() {
 return HelperHolder.helper;
}
This relies on the fact that nested classes are not loaded until they are referenced.

Semantics of field in Java 5 can be employed to safely publish the helper object without using :
public class FinalWrapper&lt;T&gt; {
 public final T value;
 public FinalWrapper(T value) {
 this.value = value;
}

public class Foo {
 private FinalWrapper&lt;Helper&gt; helperWrapper;

 public Helper getHelper() {
 FinalWrapper&lt;Helper&gt; tempWrapper = helperWrapper;

 if (tempWrapper == null) {
 synchronized (this) {
 if (helperWrapper == null) {
 helperWrapper = new FinalWrapper&lt;Helper&gt;(new Helper());
 tempWrapper = helperWrapper;
 }
 return tempWrapper.value;
}
The local variable is required for correctness: simply using for both null checks and the return statement could fail due to read reordering allowed under the Java Memory Model. Performance of this implementation is not necessarily better than the implementation.

== Usage in C# ==

In .NET Framework 4.0, the codice_6 class was introduced, which internally uses double-checked locking by default (ExecutionAndPublication mode) to store either the exception that was thrown during construction, or the result of the function that was passed to codice_6:
public class MySingleton
 private static readonly Lazy&lt;MySingleton&gt; _mySingleton = new Lazy&lt;MySingleton&gt;(() =&gt; new MySingleton());

 private MySingleton() { }

 public static MySingleton Instance =&gt; _mySingleton.Value;

<text>Thomas Fuller (baptised 19 June 1608 – 16 August 1661) was an English churchman and historian. He is now remembered for his writings, particularly his &quot;Worthies of England&quot;, published in 1662, after his death. He was a prolific author, and one of the first English writers able to live by his pen (and his many patrons).

==Early life==
Fuller was the eldest son of Thomas Fuller, rector of Aldwinkle St Peter&#x27;s, Northamptonshire. He was born at his father&#x27;s rectory and was baptised on 19 June 1608. Dr John Davenant, bishop of Salisbury, was his uncle and godfather. According to John Aubrey, Fuller was &quot;a boy of pregnant wit&quot;. At thirteen he was admitted to Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, then presided over by John Davenant. His cousin, Edward Davenant, was a tutor there. He did well academically; and in Lent 1624–1625 he became B.A. and in July 1628, at only 20 years of age, received his M.A. After being overlooked in an election of fellows of his college, he moved to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge in November 1628. In 1630 he received from Corpus Christi College the curacy of St Bene&#x27;t&#x27;s, Cambridge.

Fuller&#x27;s oratory soon attracted attention. In June 1631 his uncle gave him a prebend in Salisbury, where his father, who would die in the following year, already held a canonry. The rectory of Broadwindsor, Dorset, then in the diocese of Bristol, was his next preferment (1634); and on 11 June 1635 he achieved the degree of Bachelor of Divinity from Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. In 1640, he was elected proctor for Bristol in the memorable Convocation of Canterbury, which assembled with the Short Parliament. On the sudden dissolution of the latter he joined those who urged that convocation should likewise dissolve. That opinion was overruled; and the assembly continued to sit by royal writ. Fuller wrote a valuable account of the proceedings of this synod in his &quot;Church History,&quot; although he was fined £200 for remaining.

==Civil War period==
At Broadwindsor, early in 1641, Thomas Fuller, his curate Henry Sanders, the churchwardens, and five others certified that their parish, represented by 242 adult males, had taken the Protestation ordered by the speaker of the Long Parliament. Fuller was not formally dispossessed of his living and prebend on the triumph of the Presbyterian party, but he relinquished both preferments about this time. For a short time he preached with success at the Inns of Court, and then at the invitation of the master of the Savoy, Walter Balcanqual, and the brotherhood of that foundation, became lecturer at their chapel of St Mary Savoy. Some of the best discourses of the witty preacher were delivered at the Savoy to audiences which extended into the chapel-yard. In one he set forth with searching and truthful minuteness the hindrances to peace, and urged the signing of petitions to the king at Oxford, and to the parliament, to continue their care in advancing an accommodation.

In his &quot;Appeal of Injured Innocence&quot; Fuller says that he was once deputed to carry a petition to the king at Oxford. This has been identified with a petition entrusted to Sir Edward Wardour, clerk of the pells, Dr Dukeson, &quot;Dr Fuller,&quot; and four or five others from the city of Westminster and the parishes contiguous to the Savoy. A pass was granted by the House of Lords, on 2 January 1643, for an equipage of two coaches, four or six horses and eight or ten attendants. On the arrival of the deputation at the Treaty of Uxbridge, on 4 January, officers of the Parliamentary army stopped the coaches and searched the gentlemen; and they found upon the latter &quot;two scandalous books arraigning the proceedings of the House,&quot; and letters with ciphers to Lord Viscount Falkland and the Lord Spencer. A joint order of both Houses remanded the party; and Fuller and his friends were briefly imprisoned. The Westminster Petition reached the king&#x27;s hands; and it was published with the royal reply.

When it was expected, three months later, that a favourable result would attend the negotiations at Oxford, Fuller preached a sermon at Westminster Abbey, on 27 March 1643, on the anniversary of Charles I&#x27;s accession, on the text, &quot;Yea, let him take all, so my Lord the King return in peace.&quot; On Wednesday 26 July, he preached on church reformation, satirising the religious reformers, and maintaining that only the Supreme Power could initiate reforms.

He was now obliged to leave London, and in August 1643 he joined the king at Oxford, where he lodged in a chamber at Lincoln College. Thence he put forth a witty and effective reply to John Saltmarsh, who had attacked his views on ecclesiastical reform. Fuller subsequently published by royal request a sermon preached on 10 May 1644, at St Mary&#x27;s, Oxford, before the king and Prince Charles, called &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Vow&quot;. The spirit of Fuller&#x27;s preaching, characterised by calmness and moderation, offended the high royalists. To silence unjust censures he became chaplain to the regiment of Sir Ralph Hopton.

For the first five years of the war, he &quot;had little list or leisure to write, fearing to be made a history, and shifting daily for my safety. All that time I could not live to study, who did only study to live.&quot; After the defeat of Hopton at Cheriton Down, Fuller retreated to Basing House. He took an active part in its defence, and his life with the troops caused him to be afterwards regarded as one of &quot;the great cavalier parsons&quot;. He compiled in 1645 a small volume of prayers and meditations – the &quot;Good Thoughts in Bad Times&quot; – which, set up and printed in the besieged city of Exeter, where he had retired, was called by himself &quot;the first fruits of Exeter press&quot;. It was inscribed to Lady Dalkeith, governess to the infant princess, Henrietta Anne (b. 1644), to whose household he was attached as chaplain. The corporation gave him the Bodleian lectureship on 21 March 1646, and he held it until 17 June following, soon after the surrender of the city to the parliament.

&quot;The Fear of Losing the Old Light&quot; (1646) was his farewell discourse to his Exeter friends. Under the Articles of Surrender Fuller made his composition with the government at London, his &quot;delinquency&quot; being that he had been present in the king&#x27;s garrisons. In &quot;Andronicus, or the Unfortunate Politician&quot; (1646), partly authentic and partly fictitious, he satirised the leaders of the Revolution; and for the comfort of sufferers by the war he issued (1647) a second devotional manual, entitled &quot;Good Thoughts in Worse Times&quot;, abounding in fervent aspirations, and drawing moral lessons in beautiful language out of the events of his life or the circumstances of the time. In grief over his losses, which included his library and manuscripts (his &quot;upper and nether millstone&quot;), and over the calamities of the country, he wrote his work on the &quot;Cause and Cure of a Wounded Conscience&quot; (1647). It was prepared at Boughton House in his native county, where he and his son were entertained by Edward Lord Montagu, who had been one of his contemporaries at the university and had taken the side of the parliament. For the next few years of his life Fuller was mainly dependent upon his dealings with booksellers, of whom he asserted that none had ever lost by him. He made considerable progress in an English translation from the manuscript of the &quot;Annales&quot; of his friend Archbishop Ussher.

==Under the Commonwealth==

Amongst his benefactors was Sir John Danvers of Chelsea, the regicide. Fuller in 1647 began to preach at St Clement&#x27;s, Eastcheap, and elsewhere in the capacity of lecturer. While at St Clement&#x27;s he was suspended; but soon recovered his freedom and preached wherever he was invited. At Chelsea, where he also occasionally officiated, he covertly preached a sermon on the death of Charles, but he did not break with his Roundhead patrons. James Hay, 2nd Earl of Carlisle made him his chaplain, and presented him in 1648 or 1649 to the curacy of Waltham Abbey. His possession of the living was in jeopardy on the appointment of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s &quot;Tryers&quot;; but he evaded their inquisitorial questions by his ready wit. He was not disturbed at Waltham in 1655, when the Protector&#x27;s edict prohibited the adherents of the late king from preaching.

There is good reason to suppose that Fuller was at the Hague immediately before the Restoration, in the retinue of Lord Berkeley, one of the commissioners of the House of Lords, whose last service to his friend was to interest himself in obtaining him a bishopric. &quot;A Panegyrick to His Majesty on his Happy Return&quot;, one of the many contemporary poems celebrating the restoration of Charles II, was the last of Fuller&#x27;s verse efforts.

==After the Restoration==
On 2 August 1660, by royal letters, he was admitted Doctor of Divinity at Cambridge. He resumed his lectures at the Savoy, where Samuel Pepys heard him preach; but he preferred his conversation or his books to his sermons. Fuller&#x27;s last promotion was that of Chaplain Extraordinary to Charles II.

==Death==

In the summer of 1661 Fuller visited the West in connection with the business of his prebend, which had been restored to him. On Sunday 12 August, while preaching at the Savoy, he was seized with typhus fever, and died at his new lodgings in Covent Garden on 16 August. He was buried in St Dunstan&#x27;s Church, Cranford, Middlesex (of which he was rector). A mural tablet was afterwards set up on the north side of the chancel, with an epitaph which contains a conceit worthy of his own pen, to the effect that while he was endeavouring (i.e. in the &quot;Worthies&quot;) to give immortality to others, he himself attained it.

==Works==

* &quot;David&#x27;s Heinous Sinne, Heartie Repentance, Heavie Punishment&quot; (1631). Fuller published a poem on the subject of David and Bathsheba. 
* &quot;The Historie of the Holy Warre&quot; (1639). A history of the Crusades from the fall of Jerusalem under Titus in 70 AD through 1290. Includes critical commentary, a complete chronology, and bibliography. With an introduction by English classical scholar James Duport (1606–1679). &quot;The History of the Holy War&quot; is an 1840 edition of the work.
* &quot;Joseph&#x27;s party-coloured Coat&quot; (1640). His first published volume of sermons.
* &quot;The Holy State and the Prophane State&quot; (1642). This work describes the holy state as existing in the family and in public life, gives rules of conduct, model &quot;characters&quot; for the various professions and profane biographies. It was perhaps the most popular of all his writings.
* &quot;A Pisgah-Sight of Palestine and the confines thereof; with the history of the Old and New Testaments acted thereon&quot; (1650). With facsimiles of all the quaint maps and illustrations of the original edition. Lionel Cranfield, 3rd Earl of Middlesex, who lived at Copt Hall, near Waltham, gave him what remained of the books of the lord treasurer his father; and through the good offices of the marchioness of Hertford, part of his own pillaged library was restored to him. Fuller was thus able to prosecute his literary labours, producing successively his descriptive geography of the Holy Land.
* &quot;Abel Redevivus: or The dead yet speaking. The lives and the deaths of the moderne divines. Written by severall able and learned men (whose names ye shall finde in the epistle to the reader.) And now digested into one volumne, for the benefit and satisfaction of all those that desire to be acquainted with the paths of piety and virtue.&quot; (1651). London, John Stafford.
* &quot;Church-History of Britain&quot;, from the birth of Jesus Christ until the year 1648 (1655). &quot;Church-History&quot; was printed with &quot;The History of the University of Cambridge since the Conquest&quot; and &quot;The History of Waltham Abbey&quot;. These works were furthered by his connection with Sion College, London, where he had a room. The &quot;Church History&quot; was angrily attacked from the high-church side by Peter Heylin. At the Oxford Act of 1657, Robert South, who was &quot;Terrae filius&quot;, lampooned Fuller, whom he described in this &quot;Oratio&quot; as living in London, ever scribbling and each year bringing forth new folia like a tree. At length, continues South, the &quot;Church-History&quot; came forth with its 166 dedications to wealthy and noble friends; and with this huge volume under one arm, and his wife (said to be little of stature) on the other, he ran up and down the streets of London, seeking at the houses of his patrons invitations to dinner, to be repaid by his dull jests at table. His last and best patron was George Berkeley, 1st Earl Berkeley (1628–1698), of Cranford House, Middlesex, whose chaplain he was, and who gave him Cranford rectory (1658). Fuller afterwards dedicated &quot;The Appeal of Injured Innocence&quot; (1659), his reply to Heylyn&#x27;s &quot;Examen Historicum&quot;, to Berkeley. In &quot;An Alarum to the Counties of England and Wales&quot; (1660) Fuller argued for a free and full parliament—free from force, as he expressed it, as well as from abjurations or previous engagements. &quot;Mixt Contemplations in Better Times&quot; (1660), dedicated to Lady Monk, tendered advice in the spirit of its motto, &quot;Let your moderation be known to all men: the Lord is at hand&quot;.
* &#x27;Notes upon Jonah&#x27;, (1657). John Stafford.
* &quot;History of the Worthies of England&quot; (1662). Fuller&#x27;s best-known work.
* &quot;The Poems and translations in verse, including fifty-nine hitherto unpublished epigrams of Fuller and his much-wished form of prayer for the first time collected and edited with introduction and notes&quot;, by rev. Grosart, 257 pp., Liverpool, printed for private circulation (1868).

==Reception==
Fuller&#x27;s sense of humour kept him from extremes. &quot;By his particular temper and management&quot;, said Laurence Echard in his &quot;History of England&quot;, &quot;he weathered the late great storm with more success than many other great men&quot;. He was known as &quot;a perfect walking library&quot;. Antithetic and axiomatic sentences abound in his pages. &quot;Wit,&quot; wrote Coleridge after reading the &quot;Church History&quot;, &quot;was the stuff and substance of Fuller&#x27;s intellect&quot;. Charles Lamb made some selections from Fuller, and admired his &quot;golden works.&quot; American essayist Samuel McChord Crothers devoted a chapter of his 1916 book &quot;The Pleasures of an Absentee Landlord&quot; to an appreciation of Fuller and of the genial spirit of Fuller&#x27;s prose, writing thatFuller retains the intimate tone of one who is in a little circle of friends. There is no attempt at the impartial dignity of history. If he tells what happens, he takes it for granted that we should like to know what he thinks about it.

==Family==
In about 1640 Fuller married Eleanor, daughter of Hugh Grove of Chisenbury, Wiltshire. She died in 1641. Their son, John, baptised at Broadwindsor by his father on 6 June 1641, was afterwards of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, saw his father&#x27;s &quot;Worthies of England&quot; through the press in 1662, and became rector of Great Wakering, Essex, where he died in 1687.

About 1652 Fuller married his second wife, Mary Roper, youngest sister of Thomas Roper, 1st Viscount Baltinglass, by whom he had several children.

<text>Swing music is a style of jazz that developed in the United States during the late 1920s and early 1930s. It became nationally popular from the mid-1930s. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement. The danceable swing style of big bands and bandleaders such as Benny Goodman was the dominant form of American popular music from 1935 to 1946, known as the swing era, when people were dancing the Lindy Hop. The verb &quot;to swing&quot; is also used as a term of praise for playing that has a strong groove or drive. Musicians of the swing era include Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, Count Basie, Cab Calloway, Benny Carter, Jimmy Dorsey, Tommy Dorsey, Woody Herman, Earl Hines, Bunny Berigan, Harry James, Lionel Hampton, Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, Jimmie Lunceford, and Django Reinhardt.

== Overview ==
Swing has its roots in 1920s dance music ensembles, which began using new styles of written arrangements, incorporating rhythmic innovations pioneered by Louis Armstrong, Coleman Hawkins, Benny Carter and other jazzmen. During the World War II era, swing began to decline in popularity, and after war, bebop and jump blues gained popularity.

Swing blended with other genres to create new musical styles. In country music, artists such as Jimmie Rodgers, Moon Mullican, Milton Brown and Bob Wills introduced elements of swing along with blues to create a genre called &quot;western swing&quot;. Famous roma guitarist Django Reinhardt created gypsy swing music and composed the gypsy swing standard &quot;Minor Swing&quot;. In the late 1980s to early 1990s, new urban-styled swing-beat emerged called new jack swing (New York go-go), created by young producer Teddy Riley. In the late 1990s and into the 2000s, there was a swing revival, led by Squirrel Nut Zippers, Brian Setzer orchestra and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.

== 1920s: Roots ==

Developments in dance orchestra and jazz music during the 1920s both contributed to the development of the 1930s swing style. Starting in 1923, the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra featured innovative arrangements by Don Redman that featured call-response interplay between brass and reed sections, and interludes arranged to back up soloists. The arrangements also had a smoother rhythmic sense than the ragtime-influenced arrangements that were the more typical &quot;hot&quot; dance music of the day. In 1924 Louis Armstrong joined the Henderson band, lending impetus to an even greater emphasis on soloists. The Henderson band also featured Coleman Hawkins, Benny Carter, and Buster Bailey as soloists, who all were influential in the development of swing era instrumental styles. During the Henderson band&#x27;s extended residency at the Roseland Ballroom in New York, it became influential on other big bands. Duke Ellington credited the Henderson band with being an early influence when he was developing the sound for his own band. In 1925 Armstrong left the Henderson band and would add his innovations to New Orleans style jazz to develop Chicago style jazz, another step towards swing.

Traditional New Orleans style jazz was based on a two-beat meter and contrapuntal improvisation led by a trumpet or cornet, typically followed by a clarinet and trombone in a call-response pattern. The rhythm section consisted of a sousaphone and drums, and sometimes a banjo. By the early 1920s guitars and pianos sometimes substituted for the banjo and a string bass sometimes substituted for the sousaphone. Use of the string bass opened possibilities for 4/4 instead of 2/4 time at faster tempos, which increased rhythmic freedom. The Chicago style released the soloist from the constraints of contrapuntal improvisation with other front-line instruments, lending greater freedom in creating melodic lines. Louis Armstrong used the additional freedom of the new format with 4/4 time, accenting the second and fourth beats and anticipating the main beats with lead-in notes in his solos to create a sense of rhythmic pulse that happened between the beats as well as on them, i.e. swing.

In 1927 Armstrong worked with pianist Earl Hines, who had a similar impact on his instrument as Armstrong had on trumpet. Hines&#x27; melodic, horn-like conception of playing deviated from the contemporary conventions in jazz piano centered on building rhythmic patterns around &quot;pivot notes&quot;. His approaches to rhythm and phrasing were also free and daring, exploring ideas that would define swing playing. His approach to rhythm often used accents on the lead-in instead of the main beat, and mixed meters, to build a sense of anticipation to the rhythm and make his playing swing. He also used &quot;stops&quot; or musical silences to build tension in his phrasing. Hines&#x27; style was a seminal influence on the styles of swing-era pianists Teddy Wilson, Art Tatum, Jess Stacy, Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole, Erroll Garner, Mary Lou Williams, and Jay McShann.

Black territory dance bands in the southwest were developing dynamic styles that often went in the direction of blues-based simplicity, using riffs in a call-response pattern to build a strong, danceable rhythm and provide a musical platform for extended solos. The rhythm-heavy tunes for dancing were called &quot;stomps&quot;. The requirement for volume led to continued use of the sousaphone over the string bass with the larger ensembles, which dictated a more conservative approach to rhythm based on 2/4 time signatures. Meanwhile, string bass players such as Walter Page were developing their technique to the point where they could hold down the bottom end of a full-sized dance orchestra.

The growth of radio broadcasting and the recording industry in the 1920s allowed some of the more popular dance bands to gain national exposure. The most popular style of dance orchestra was the &quot;sweet&quot; style, often with strings. Paul Whiteman developed a style he called &quot;symphonic jazz&quot;, grafting a classical approach over his interpretation of jazz rhythms in an approach he hoped would be the future of jazz. Whiteman&#x27;s Orchestra enjoyed great commercial success and was a major influence on the sweet bands. Jean Goldkette&#x27;s Victor Recording Orchestra featured many of the top white jazz musicians of the day including Bix Beiderbecke, Jimmy Dorsey, Frank Trumbauer, Pee Wee Russell, Eddie Lang, and Joe Venuti. The Victor Recording Orchestra won the respect of the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra in a Battle of the Bands; Henderson&#x27;s cornetist Rex Stewart credited the Goldkette band with being the most influential white band in the development of swing music before Benny Goodman&#x27;s. As a dance music promoter and agent, Goldkette also helped organize and promote McKinney&#x27;s Cotton Pickers and Glen Gray&#x27;s Orange Blossoms (later the Casa Loma Orchestra), two other Detroit-area bands that were influential in the early swing era.

==Early swing==
As the 1920s turned to the 1930s, the new concepts in rhythm and ensemble playing that comprised the swing style were transforming the sounds of large and small bands. Starting in 1928, The Earl Hines Orchestra was broadcast throughout much of the midwest from the Grand Terrace Cafe in Chicago, where Hines had the opportunity to expound upon his new approaches to rhythm and phrasing with a big band. Hines&#x27; arranger Jimmy Mundy would later contribute to the catalog of the Benny Goodman Orchestra. The Duke Ellington Orchestra had its new sounds broadcast nationally from New York&#x27;s Cotton Club, followed by the Cab Calloway Orchestra and the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra. Also in New York, the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra featured the new style at the Roseland Ballroom and the swing powerhouse Chick Webb Orchestra started its extended stay at the Savoy Ballroom in 1931. Bennie Moten and the Kansas City Orchestra showcased the riff-propelled, solo-oriented form of swing that had been developing in the hothouse of Kansas City. Emblematic of the evolving music was the change in the name of Moten&#x27;s signature tune, from &quot;Moten Stomp&quot; to &quot;Moten Swing&quot;. Moten&#x27;s orchestra had a highly successful tour in late 1932. Audiences raved about the new music, and at the Pearl Theatre in Philadelphia in December 1932, the doors were let open to the public who crammed into the theatre to hear the new sound, demanding seven encores from Moten&#x27;s orchestra.

With the early 1930s came the financial difficulties of the Great Depression that curtailed recording of the new music and drove some bands out of business, including the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra and McKinney&#x27;s Cotton Pickers in 1934. Henderson&#x27;s next business was selling arrangements to up-and-coming bandleader Benny Goodman. 

At this time, &quot;Sweet&quot; dance music remained most popular with white audiences and was successfully showcased by bandleaders such as Guy Lombardo
 and Shep Fields, but the Casa Loma Orchestra and the Benny Goodman Orchestra went against that grain, targeting the new swing style to younger audiences. Despite Benny Goodman&#x27;s claim that &quot;sweet&quot; music was a &quot;weak sister&quot; as compared to the &quot;real music&quot; of America, Lombardo&#x27;s band enjoyed widespread popularity for decades while crossing over racial divides and was even praised by Louis Armstrong as one of his favorites

==1935–1946: The swing era==


In 1935 the Benny Goodman Orchestra had won a spot on the radio show &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; and started showcasing an updated repertoire featuring Fletcher Henderson arrangements. Goodman&#x27;s slot was after midnight in the East, and few people heard it. It was on earlier on the West Coast and developed the audience that later led to Goodman&#x27;s Palomar Ballroom triumph. At the Palomar engagement starting on 21 August 1935, audiences of young white dancers favored Goodman&#x27;s rhythm and daring arrangements. The sudden success of the Goodman orchestra transformed the landscape of popular music in America. Goodman&#x27;s success with &quot;hot&quot; swing brought forth imitators and enthusiasts of the new style throughout the world of dance bands, which launched the &quot;swing era&quot; that lasted until 1946.

A typical song played in swing style would feature a strong, anchoring rhythm section in support of more loosely-tied woodwind and brass sections playing call-response to each other. The level of improvisation that the audience might expect varied with the arrangement, song, band, and band-leader. Typically included in big band swing arrangements were an introductory chorus that stated the theme, choruses arranged for soloists, and climactic out-choruses. Some arrangements were built entirely around a featured soloist or vocalist. Some bands used string or vocal sections, or both. Swing-era repertoire included the Great American Songbook of Tin Pan Alley standards, band originals, traditional jazz tunes such as the &quot;King Porter Stomp&quot;, with which the Goodman orchestra had a smash hit, and blues.

Hot swing music is strongly associated with the jitterbug dancing that became a national craze accompanying the swing craze. Swing dancing originated in the late 1920s as the &quot;Lindy Hop&quot;, and would later incorporate other styles including The Suzie Q, Truckin&#x27;, Peckin&#x27; Jive, The Big Apple, and The Shag in various combinations of moves. A subculture of jitterbuggers, sometimes growing quite competitive, congregated around ballrooms that featured hot swing music. A dance floor full of jitterbuggers had cinematic appeal; they were sometimes featured in newsreels and movies. Some of the top jitterbuggers gathered in professional dance troupes such as Whitey&#x27;s Lindy Hoppers (featured in &quot;A Day At the Races&quot;, &quot;Everybody Dance&quot;, and &quot;Hellzapoppin&#x27;&quot;). Swing dancing would outlive the swing era, becoming associated with R&amp;B and early Rock&amp;Roll.

As with many new popular musical styles, swing met with some resistance because of its improvisation, tempo, occasionally risqué lyrics, and frenetic dancing. Audiences used to traditional &quot;sweet&quot; arrangements, such as those offered by Guy Lombardo, Sammy Kaye, Kay Kyser and Shep Fields, were taken aback by the rambunctiousness of swing music. Swing was sometimes regarded as light entertainment, more of an industry to sell records to the masses than a form of art, among fans of both jazz and &quot;serious&quot; music. Some jazz critics such as Hugues Panassié held the polyphonic improvisation of New Orleans jazz to be the pure form of jazz, with swing a form corrupted by regimentation and commercialism. Panassié was also an advocate of the theory that jazz was a primal expression of the black American experience and that white musicians, or black musicians who became interested in more sophisticated musical ideas, were generally incapable of expressing its core values. In his 1941 autobiography, W. C. Handy wrote that &quot;prominent white orchestra leaders, concert singers and others are making commercial use of Negro music in its various phases. That&#x27;s why they introduced &quot;swing&quot; which is not a musical form&quot; (no comment on Fletcher Henderson, Earl Hines, Duke Ellington, or Count Basie). The Dixieland revival started in the late 1930s as a self-conscious re-creation of New Orleans jazz in reaction against the orchestrated style of big band swing. Some swing bandleaders saw opportunities in the Dixieland revival. Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s Clambake Seven and Bob Crosby&#x27;s Bobcats were examples of Dixieland ensembles within big swing bands.

Between the poles of hot and sweet, middlebrow interpretations of swing led to great commercial success for bands such as those led by Artie Shaw, Glenn Miller and Tommy Dorsey. Miller&#x27;s trademark clarinet-led reed section was decidedly &quot;sweet&quot;, but the Miller catalog had no shortage of bouncy, medium-tempo dance tunes and some up-tempo tunes such as &quot;Mission to Moscow&quot; and the Lionel Hampton composition &quot;Flying Home&quot;. &quot;The Sentimental Gentleman of Swing&quot; Tommy Dorsey made a nod to the hot side by hiring jazz trumpeter and Goodman alumnus Bunny Berigan, then hiring Jimmie Lunceford&#x27;s arranger Sy Oliver to spice up his catalog in 1939.

New York became a touchstone for national success of big bands, with nationally broadcast engagements at the Roseland and Savoy ballrooms a sign that a swing band had arrived on the national scene. With its Savoy engagement in 1937, the Count Basie Orchestra brought the riff-and-solo oriented Kansas City style of swing to national attention. The Basie orchestra collectively and individually would influence later styles that would give rise to the smaller &quot;jump&quot; bands and bebop. The Chick Webb Orchestra remained closely identified with the Savoy Ballroom, having originated the tune &quot;Stompin&#x27; at the Savoy&quot;, and became feared in the Savoy&#x27;s Battles of the Bands. It humiliated Goodman&#x27;s band, and had memorable encounters with the Ellington and Basie bands. The Goodman band&#x27;s 1938 Carnegie Hall Concert turned into a summit of swing, with guests from the Basie and Ellington bands invited for a jam session after the Goodman band&#x27;s performance. Coleman Hawkins arrived back from an extended stay in Europe to New York in 1939, recorded his famous version of &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, and fronted his own big band. 1940 saw top-flight musicians such as Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Don Byas, Charlie Christian, and Gene Ramey, whose careers in swing had brought them to New York, beginning to coalesce and develop the ideas that would become bebop.

==1940s: Decline==
The early 1940s saw emerging trends in popular music and jazz that would, once they had run their course, result in the end of the swing era. Vocalists were becoming the star attractions of the big bands. Vocalist Ella Fitzgerald, after joining the Chick Webb Orchestra in 1936, propelled the band to great popularity and the band continued under her name after Webb&#x27;s death in 1939. In 1940 vocalist Vaughn Monroe was leading his own big band and Frank Sinatra was becoming the star attraction of the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, inciting mass hysteria among bobby-soxers. Vocalist Peggy Lee joined the Goodman Orchestra in 1941 for a two-year stint, quickly becoming its star attraction on its biggest hits. Some big bands were moving away from the swing styles that dominated the late 1930s, for both commercial and creative reasons. Some of the more commercial big bands catered to more &quot;sweet&quot; sensibilities with string sections. Some bandleaders such as John Kirby, Raymond Scott, and Claude Thornhill were fusing swing with classical repertoire. Lower manpower requirements and simplicity favored the rise of small band swing. The Savoy Sultans and other smaller bands led by Louis Jordan, Lucky Millinder, Louis Prima, and Tony Pastor were showcasing an exuberant &quot;jump swing&quot; style that would lead to the postwar rise of R&amp;B. In a 1939 &quot;DownBeat&quot; interview, Duke Ellington expressed dissatisfaction with the creative state of swing music; within a few years he and other bandleaders would be delving into more ambitious, and less danceable, forms of orchestral jazz and the creative forefront for soloists would be moving into smaller ensembles and bebop. The Earl Hines Orchestra in 1943 featured a collection of young, forward-looking musicians who were at the core of the bebop movement and would in the following year be in the Billy Eckstine Orchestra, the first big band to showcase bebop. As the swing era went into decline, it secured legacies in vocalist-centered popular music, &quot;progressive&quot; big band jazz, R&amp;B, and bebop.

The trend away from big-band swing was accelerated by wartime conditions and royalty conflicts. In 1941 the American Society of Composers and Producers (ASCAP) demanded bigger royalties from broadcasters and the broadcasters refused. Consequently, ASCAP banned the large repertoire they controlled from airplay, severely restricting what the radio audience could hear. ASCAP also demanded pre-approval of set lists and even written solos for live broadcasts, to assure that not even a quoted fragment of ASCAP repertoire was broadcast. Those restrictions made broadcast swing much less appealing for the year in which the ban was in place. Big band swing remained popular during the war years, but the resources required to support it became problematic. Wartime restriction on travel, coupled with rising expenses, curtailed road touring. The manpower requirements for big swing bands placed a burden on the scarce resources available for touring and were impacted by the military draft. In July 1942 the American Federation of Musicians called a ban on recording until record labels agreed to pay royalties to musicians. That stopped recording of instrumental music for major labels for over a year, with the last labels agreeing to new contract terms in November 1944. In the meantime, vocalists continued to record backed by vocal groups and the recording industry released earlier swing recordings from their vaults, increasingly reflecting the popularity of big band vocalists. In 1943 Columbia Records re-released the 1939 recording of &quot;All or Nothing at All&quot; by the Harry James Orchestra with Frank Sinatra, giving Sinatra top billing (&quot;Acc. Harry James and his Orchestra&quot;). The recording found the commercial success that had eluded its original release. Small band swing was recorded for small specialty labels not affected by the ban. These labels had limited distribution centered in large urban markets, which tended to limit the size of the ensembles with which recording could be a money-making proposition. Another blow fell on the market for dance-oriented swing in 1944 when the federal government levied a 30% excise tax on &quot;dancing&quot; nightclubs, undercutting the market for dance music in smaller venues.

==1950s–1960s==
===Swingin&#x27; pop===

Swing bands and sales continued to decline from 1953 to 1954. In 1955, a list of top recording artists from the previous year was publicly released. The list revealed that big band sales had decreased since the early 1950s. However, big band music saw a revival in the 1950s and 1960s. One impetus was the demand for studio and stage orchestras as backups for popular vocalists, and in radio and television broadcasts. Ability to adapt performing styles to various situations was an essential skill among these bands-for-hire, with a somewhat sedated version of swing in common use for backing up vocalists. The resurgent commercial success of Frank Sinatra with a mildly swinging backup during the mid-1950s solidified the trend. It became a sound associated with pop vocalists such as Bobby Darin, Dean Martin, Judy Garland, and Nat King Cole, as well as jazz-oriented vocalists such as Ella Fitzgerald and Keely Smith. Many of these singers were also involved in the &quot;less swinging&quot; vocal pop music of this period. The bands in these contexts performed in relative anonymity, receiving secondary credit beneath the top billing. Some, such as the Nelson Riddle and Gordon Jenkins Orchestras, became well known in their own right, with Riddle particularly associated with the success of Sinatra and Cole. Swingin&#x27; pop remained popular into the mid-1960s, becoming one current of the &quot;easy listening&quot; genre.

===Big band jazz===
Big band jazz made a comeback as well. The Stan Kenton and Woody Herman bands maintained their popularity during lean years of the late 1940s and beyond, making their mark with innovative arrangements and high-level jazz soloists (Shorty Rogers, Art Pepper, Kai Winding, Stan Getz, Al Cohn, Zoot Sims, Serge Chaloff, Gene Ammons, Sal Nistico). Lionel Hampton was a leader in the R&amp;B genre during the late 1940s then re-entered big band jazz in the early 1950s, remaining a popular attraction through the 1960s. Count Basie and Duke Ellington had both downsized their big bands during the first half of the 1950s, then reconstituted them by 1956. Ellington&#x27;s venture back into big band jazz was encouraged by its reception at the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival. The Basie and Ellington bands flourished creatively and commercially through the 1960s and beyond, with both veteran leaders receiving high acclaim for their contemporary work and performing until they were physically unable. Drummer Buddy Rich, after briefly leading one big band during the late 1940s and performing in various jazz and big band gigs, formed his definitive big band in 1966. His name became synonymous with the dynamic, exuberant style of his big band. Other big jazz bands that drove the 1950s–60s revival include those led by Thad Jones, Mel Lewis, Quincy Jones, and Oliver Nelson. Big band jazz remains a major component of college jazz instruction curricula.

==Cross-genre swing==
In country music Jimmie Rodgers, Moon Mullican, and Bob Wills combined elements of swing and blues to create a Western swing. Mullican left the Cliff Bruner band to pursue solo career that included many songs that maintained a swing structure. Artists like Willie Nelson and Asleep at the Wheel have continued the swing elements of country music. Asleep at the Wheel has also recorded the Count Basie tunes &quot;One O&#x27;Clock Jump&quot;, &quot;Jumpin&#x27; at the Woodside&quot;, and &quot;Song of the Wanderer&quot; using a steel guitar as a stand-in for a horn section. Nat King Cole followed Sinatra into pop music, bringing with him a similar combination of swing and ballads. Like Mullican, he was important in bringing piano to the fore of popular music.

Gypsy swing is an outgrowth of the jazz violin swing of Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang. In Europe it was heard in the music of guitarist Django Reinhardt and violinist Stéphane Grappelli. Their repertoire overlaps 1930s swing, including French popular music, gypsy songs, and compositions by Reinhardt, but gypsy swing bands are formulated differently. There is no brass or percussion; guitars and bass form the backbone, with violin, accordion, clarinet or guitar taking the lead. Gypsy swing groups generally have no more than five players. Although they originated in different continents, similarities have often been noted between gypsy swing and Western swing, leading to various fusions.

Rock music hitmakers like Fats Domino and Elvis Presley included swing-era standards in their repertoire, making crooning ballads &quot;Are You Lonesome Tonight&quot; and &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot; into rock and roll-era hits. The doo-wop vocal group the Marcels had a big hit with their lively version of the swing-era ballad &quot;Blue Moon&quot;.

Multi-genre mandolinist Jethro Burns is known for playing swing, jazz, and other forms of the genre on the mandolin. He produced albums that feature jazz rhythms and swing chord progressions. He is often considered &quot;The Father of Jazz Mandolin&quot;.

==1960s–2000: Big Band nostalgia and swing revival==

Though swing music was no longer mainstream, fans could attend &quot;Big Band Nostalgia&quot; tours from the 1970s into the 1980s. The tours featured bandleaders and vocalists of the swing era who were semi-retired, such as Harry James and vocalist Dick Haymes. Historically-themed radio broadcasts featuring period comedy, melodrama, and music also played a role in sustaining interest in the music of the swing era.
Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks, and later David Grisman, presented adaptations of Gypsy Swing, rekindling interest in the musical form. Other swing revivals occurred during the 1970s. The jazz, R&amp;B, and swing revival vocal group Manhattan Transfer and Bette Midler included swing era hits on albums during the early 1970s. In Seattle the New Deal Rhythm Band and the Horns O Plenty Orchestra revived 1930s swing with a dose of comedy behind vocalists Phil &quot;De Basket&quot; Shallat, Cheryl &quot;Benzene&quot; Bentyne, and six-foot-tall &quot;Little Janie&quot; Lambert. Bentyne would leave the New Deal Rhythm Band in 1978 for her long career with Manhattan Transfer. Founding leader of the New Deal Rhythm Band John Holte led swing revival bands in the Seattle area until 2003.

A swing revival occurred during the 1990s and 2000s led by Royal Crown Revue, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, The Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies, Squirrel Nut Zippers, Lavay Smith, and Brian Setzer. Many of the bands played neo-swing which combined swing with rockabilly, ska, and rock. The music brought a revival in swing dancing.

In 2001 Robbie Williams&#x27;s album &quot;Swing When You&#x27;re Winning&quot; consisted mainly of popular swing covers. The album sold more than 7 million copies worldwide. In November 2013, Robbie Williams released &quot;Swings Both Ways&quot;.

==1990s to present: swing house, electro swing, and swing pop==
Another modern development consists of fusing swing (original, or remixes of classics) with hip hop and house techniques. &quot;Swing house&quot; is a sub genre of swing that has been influenced by the likes of Louis Jordan and Louis Prima. Electro swing is mainly popular in Europe, and electro swing artists incorporate influences such as tango and Django Reinhardt&#x27;s gypsy swing. Leading artists include Caravan Palace and Parov Stelar, who became popular in the late 2010s. Musically, electro swing is a misnomer as it usually samples music from the earlier Charleston era of the 1920s and doesn&#x27;t actually swing. Both genres of swing house and electro swing have been connected with the revival of swing dances, such as the Lindy Hop.

<text>Lanarkshire, also called the County of Lanark (; ), is a historic county, lieutenancy area and registration county in the Central Lowlands and Southern Uplands of Scotland. The county is no longer used for local government purposes, but gives its name to the two modern council areas of North Lanarkshire and South Lanarkshire.

The county was established as a shire (the area controlled by a sheriff) in the twelfth century, covering most of the basin of the River Clyde. The area was sometimes known as Clydesdale. In the early fifteenth century the western part of the shire was removed to become Renfrewshire. The historic county of Lanarkshire includes Glasgow, but the city had a separate lieutenancy from 1893. A Lanarkshire County Council existed from 1890 until 1975, which was based in Glasgow until 1964 when it moved to Hamilton.

Lanarkshire is generally bounded to the north by Dunbartonshire and Stirlingshire, to the north-east by West Lothian and Midlothian, to the east by Peeblesshire, to the south by Dumfriesshire, and to the west by Ayrshire and Renfrewshire. The county is more rural in the south where it extends into the hills of the Southern Uplands, and more built-up in the north where it includes much of the Greater Glasgow conurbation, Scotland&#x27;s largest urban area.

==History==

It is not known exactly when the shire of Lanark was created; it seems likely that it was created by David I (reigned 1124–1153) who was generally responsible for introducing shires as part of his introduction of Anglo-Norman style administration to Scotland. However, the first documented reference to Lanarkshire dates from the reign of David&#x27;s successor, Malcolm IV (reigned 1153–1165).

Lanarkshire covered much of the basin of the River Clyde, and took its name from the town of Lanark, which is near the geographic centre of the county and served as the first county town. When first created the shire included on its western side an area south of the Clyde stretching out to the Firth of Clyde. This western area was made the separate county of Renfrewshire in the early fifteenth century. The remainder of Lanarkshire was then divided into two wards, each with their own sheriff-substitute: Over Ward was administered from Lanark, and Nether Ward was administered from Rutherglen and Hamilton at different times. In the mid-eighteenth century the two wards were replaced with three wards: Upper Ward based in Lanark, Middle Ward based in Hamilton, and Lower Ward based in Glasgow.
Elected county councils were created in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889. Lanarkshire County Council covered the combined area of the three wards, but excluding the three burghs of Airdrie, Glasgow and Hamilton, which were deemed capable of running their own affairs. Glasgow was subsequently made a county of itself in 1893, also removing the city from the rest of Lanarkshire for judicial and lieutenancy purposes. Reforms to county council powers in 1930 saw Airdrie and Hamilton brought within the administrative area of the county council.
Lanarkshire County Council was initially based at County Buildings in Wilson Street in Glasgow; whilst the city was outside the area controlled by the county council, it was found to be the most accessible meeting place for the councillors. From 1930 the county council was based at Lanarkshire House in Ingram Street in Glasgow. Lanark County Council relocated to Lanark County Buildings in Hamilton in 1964.

In 1975, the county council was abolished under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a new system of upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Lanarkshire was included within the Strathclyde region, and the county council&#x27;s former area was divided between seven districts:
*Clydesdale (called Lanark District until 1980)
*East Kilbride
*Glasgow
*Hamilton
*Monklands
*Motherwell
*Strathkelvin

For lieutenancy purposes, the last Lord Lieutenant of Lanarkshire was made lord-lieutenant for the combined area of the Clydesdale, East Kilbride, Hamilton, Monklands, and Motherwell districts when the reforms came into effect in 1975.

Further reforms in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 saw the regions and districts abolished and replaced by all-purpose unitary council areas. Since then Lanarkshire has straddled the modern council areas of:
*East Dunbartonshire
*Glasgow
*North Lanarkshire
*South Lanarkshire

The Lanarkshire lieutenancy area was redefined at the same time to cover all of South Lanarkshire and most of North Lanarkshire, but excluding the area around Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, with the excluded area roughly corresponding to the parts of North Lanarkshire which had been in Dunbartonshire and Stirlingshire prior to 1975.

North Lanarkshire and South Lanarkshire have a joint board for valuation and electoral registration. There is also a joint health board, which does not cover Rutherglen and the surrounding area in South Lanarkshire. The boundaries of the historic county of Lanarkshire, excluding the city of Glasgow, are still used for some limited official purposes connected with land registration, being a registration county.

==Coat of arms==

Lanarkshire was granted a coat of arms by the Lord Lyon on 24 December 1886. The arms is: Party per chevron gules and argent, two cinquefoils pierced in chief ermine, and in base a man&#x27;s heart counter-changed. The cinquefoils come from the arms of the Clan Hamilton, and the heart from the arms of the Clan Douglas, the two main local families. The crest is a demi-eagle displayed with two heads, sable beaked gules. The motto is &quot;VIGILANTIA&quot;.

==Geography==

Lanarkshire occupies the valley of the river Clyde, which crosses the county from the north-west to south-east. It is predominantly flat and agricultural, rising to the south with the Lowther Hills of the Southern Uplands, with Culter Fell on the border with Peeblesshire being the highest point at 748 m (2,454 ft). In the east a small portion of the Pentland Hills lie in the county, in the vicinity of Tarbrax and Dunsyre. In the far south lies the Daer Reservoir. Northern Lanarkshire is dominated by the Glasgow conurbation, Scotland&#x27;s largest city, though some small bodies of water can be found such as the Roughrigg Reservoir, Lilly Loch, Hillend Reservoir, Forrestburn Reservoir and Black Loch. Other significant settlements include Coatbridge, East Kilbride, Motherwell, Airdrie, Blantyre, Cambuslang, Rutherglen, Wishaw, Bellshill, Strathaven and Carluke. 

===Rivers===
*North Medwin River
*South Medwin River
*River Clyde
*River Avon
*South Calder Water

==Mining industry==
From the mid-eighteenth century to the early twentieth century Lanarkshire profited from its rich seams of coal in places such as Glenboig. As the coal industry developed around Glasgow in the 1700s the price of coal to the city rose under the control of a cartel of coal owners. The solution was to carve out a canal to take advantage of the good (and uncontrolled) coal deposits of the Monklands area. By 1793, the Monklands canal was completed and the Lanarkshire coal industry thrived. The resulting boom lasted for over 100 years but reached its peak by the second decade of the twentieth century and even two world wars failed to halt the contraction. Output in the county continued to fall and the National Coal Board concentrated investment in Ayrshire, Fife and the Lothians. By 1970 there were only four collieries left in Lanarkshire and the closure of Cardowan in 1983 brought the long decline to an end.

==Transport==

The M74 motorway links Glasgow with Carlisle and points further south, with the M8 linking the city to Edinburgh. Glasgow and the surrounding areas are well served by numerous roads and train lines. The West Coast Main Line cuts north–south across the county and connects Glasgow with Manchester, Birmingham and London. Glasgow is also served by the Glasgow Subway.

==Events==
Lanarkshire hosted the International Children&#x27;s Games in August 2011. A total of 1,300 competitors and coaches, along with administrators and delegates, representing 77 cities from 33 countries worldwide attended.

<text>A heavy fighter is a historic category of fighter aircraft produced in the 1930s and 1940s, designed to carry heavier weapons or operate at longer ranges than light fighter aircraft. To achieve performance, most heavy fighters were twin-engined, and many had multi-place crews; this was in contrast to light fighters, which were typically single-engined and single-crew aircraft. In Germany, these larger fighters were known as Zerstörer (&quot;destroyers&quot;).

The heavy fighter was a major design class during the pre-World War II period, conceived as long-range escort fighters or heavily-armed bomber destroyers. Most such designs failed in this mission, as they could not maneuver quickly enough against single-engine fighters. Most notable among such designs was the Messerschmitt Bf 110, which suffered great losses during the Battle of Britain. An exception was the American Lockheed P-38 Lightning, which proved an effective heavy fighter; even against smaller, lighter, single-engine aircraft and particularly in the Pacific theater.

Many twin-engine heavy fighters found their niche as night fighters, especially in the bomber-destroyer role; or as fighter-bombers, roughly analogous to modern strike fighters. Among such conversions was the Bf 110, which served as a relatively successful night fighter, ground attacker, and fighter-bomber for most of the war; and the Bristol Beaufighter, which emerged as a major anti-shipping strike fighter of the Royal Air Force. Some heavy fighters did find success; the de Havilland Mosquito, simultaneously developed as a light bomber, twin-engine fighter and photo-reconnaissance aircraft, excelled in its originally proposed role as a fast light bomber.

Although not always contemporaneously referred to explicitly as “heavy fighters,” nearly every single combatant of WWII fielded or experimented with twin-engine multi-role combat aircraft.

==Netherlands==

The Fokker G.I was a private venture design by Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker in 1936. The G.I was designed to serve on the heavier end of the spectrum of heavy fighters, as a &quot;jachtkruiser&quot; or a bomber destroyer, and was comparable to early models of the German Messerschmitt Bf 110. The G.I was formidably armed relative even to other early heavy fighters; with twin 23 mm (.91 in) Madsen cannons, and a pair of 7.9 mm (.31 in) Madsen machine guns (later up-armed to eight machine guns) in the nose. For defensive purposes, a single Madsen 7.9 mm machine gun was mounted in a rear-facing turret, manned by the second crew-member.

Prior to the Nazi German invasion of the Netherlands, the G.I was actively involved in air-border patrols in order to ensure neutrality and the integrity of Dutch airspace. On 20 March 1940, a G.I forced down an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley from No. 77 Squadron RAF when it strayed into Dutch air space.

On 10 May 1940, when Nazi Germany invaded, 23 G.I aircraft were serviceable. In the &quot;Five-day War&quot;, the available G.I fighters were mainly deployed in ground attack missions, strafing advancing German infantry units, but were also used to attack Junkers Ju 52 transports. Although reports are fragmentary and inaccurate as to the results, G.I fighters were employed over Rotterdam and the Hague, contributing to the loss of 167 Ju 52s, scoring up to 14 confirmed aerial kills. With relentless attacks by the Luftwaffe on Dutch airfields, and overwhelming German air superiority, the G.I suffered heavy losses.

At the conclusion of hostilities, several G.Is were captured by the Germans, and utilized as heavy-fighter trainers for Bf 110 crews at Wiener Neustadt. For the next two years, &quot;Flugzeugführerschule (B) 8&quot; flew the G.I until attrition grounded the fleet. On 5 May 1941, a Fokker test pilot, Hidde Leegstra, accompanied by engineer (and member of the Fokker Board of Directors) Dr. Piet Vos, managed to fly a G.I to England from the occupied Netherlands. After landing in England, the G.I was conscripted by Phillips and Powis Aircraft. The company had designed an all-wooden fighter-bomber, and was interested in the G.I wing structure and its resistance to the rigours of a British climate. Despite being left outdoors for the remainder of the war, the G.I survived only to be eventually scrapped after 1945.

There are no surviving G.Is today, although a replica has been built, and is now displayed at the Dutch &quot;Nationaal Militair Museum&quot; (National Military Museum).

==France==

In 1934, the French Ministry of Air issued a specification for a new two or three-seat multi-role fighter, capable of functioning as a bomber escort and night fighter, as well as providing fighter direction (leading formations of single-engine fighters to their targets). The specification also required, at minimum, two forward-facing 20 mm cannons, as well as a rearward-facing machine gun for defensive purposes. This was relatively very heavy armament for a fighter in 1934, with most contemporary aircraft mounting one or two light machine guns.

In response, French aircraft manufacturer Potez developed the Potez 63 series. The basic design was close to the original specification; that of either a 2 or 3 seat, dual-engine heavy fighter, armed with two 20 mm Hispano-Suiza HS.404 cannons in gondolas under the fuselage and a rearward-facing machine gun for defense. Numerous variants and sub-variants of the 63 series would be designed and produced, including day fighter, night fighter, reconnaissance, and light bomber variants.

While the 63 series was primarily developed for the French Air Force and French Naval Air Arm, they would serve with numerous other nations, both Axis and Allied powers, via either pre-armistice sales by the French government, or via use of captured aircraft.

In French service the series saw action during the Battle of France, and post-armistice within both the Vichy French &quot;Armée de l&#x27;air de l&#x27;Armistice&quot;, and the Free French &quot;Forces Aériennes Françaises Libres&quot;. On 20 May 1940, the light bomber variant, the Potez 633, took part in a ground attack against German troops near Arras. Three 633s took part in the attack. This was the type&#x27;s only operational mission over France as two days later the 633 was withdrawn from front-line service. The day/night fighter variant, the Potez 631, had quickly proved to be an ineffectual interceptor; it was slower than some German bomber aircraft and slower than the Messerschmitt Bf 109 E-variant fighter. Perhaps the most successful unit operating the Potez 631 was the &quot;Flottille F1C&quot; of the French Naval Air Arm. Between 10 and 21 May 1940, aircraft of the &quot;flottille&quot; shot down 12 enemy aircraft in exchange for 8 of their own losses prior to its withdrawal from active combat. The reconnaissance variants, the Potez 637 and 63.11, equipped numerous &quot;Groupes de Reconnaissance&quot; of the French Air Force, with more than 700 reconnaissance Potez 63.11s having been delivered.

The Potez 63.11 suffered the more losses than any other French type. One factor contributing to the high losses was the near-complete lack of spares, rendering 70 63.11s unserviceable even prior to the German invasion; many aircraft were destroyed on the ground by enemy bombing and strafing attacks, and entire units were wiped out without conducting a single mission.

In addition to the Potez 63 series, another aircraft was developed from the original 1934 heavy fighter specification. This was the Bréguet 690, designed and manufactured originally by Bréguet Aviation. While the Bréguet 690 was not selected to serve as France&#x27;s primary heavy fighter, the French Air Force&#x27;s command staff was still intrigued by the sturdy and versatile design. By 1938, with France falling behind in ground-attack/close-air support aircraft, the decision was made by the Air Force to re-designate the Bréguet 690 as the Bréguet 691, and to utilize it as a ground-attack aircraft. The 691&#x27;s engines proved unreliable in testing, and the decision was made to mount new engines on the design, which was finally designated as the Bréguet 693.

Few 693s were completed before the Nazi German invasion, however, enough were completed to see some action. The 693 made its combat debut on 12 May 1940 when twelve 693s were sent to attack a German mechanized column near Tongeren. Six to eight were shot down by German flak, two more 693s were lost while attempting to return to base, and of those that made it home safely, one was written off (most of the twenty four crewmen survived or were captured alive, although three died during the attack and some of the survivors were badly wounded). As the fighting drew to a close the French attempted to fly as many 693s as possible to North Africa, but only three made the flight, and none were used by the Vichy Air Force in North Africa. In November 1942 with the German occupation of Vichy France, the remaining Bréguets were seized. Some had their engines removed for use in German aircraft, while others were passed on to the Italians, who used them as training aircraft.

==Germany==
The Messerschmitt Bf 110 was a pre-war German fighter design to meet a RLM specification for a long-ranged fighter. Prior to the war, it was considered by the German Luftwaffe more important than their single-engine fighters. Many of the best pilots were assigned to Bf 110 wings, specifically designated as &quot;Zerstörergeschwader&quot; (&quot;destroyer squadron&quot;, &quot;Zerstörer&quot; being the same word as used for naval destroyers) wings. While lighter fighters were intended for defense, the destroyers were intended for offensive missions: to escort bombers on missions at long range, then use its superior speed to outrun defending fighters that would be capable of outmaneuvering it.

This doctrine proved to be a costly mistake. In practice the Bf 110 was capable of using this combination of features for only a short time, until the late summer of 1940. It served well against the Hawker Hurricane during the Battle of France, but was easily outperformed by – and up to 50 km/h (31 mph) slower in top speed than – the Supermarine Spitfire during the Battle of Britain. Eventually Bf 110s were converted to interceptors, and were particularly successful in the later marks of the Bf 110G series from 1942 to 1943 onwards as night fighters, serving as the primary aircraft of the Luftwaffe &quot;Nachtjagdgeschwader&quot; night fighter wings, using various versions of the Lichtenstein radar for nocturnal interception of RAF Bomber Command heavy bombers, as well as finding some use as ground-attack aircraft. The Me 210 and Me 410 &quot;Hornisse&quot; were all-new aircraft designs meant to replace the Bf 110, but also could not outrun contemporary single-engine fighters, with the Me 210 having serious aerodynamic problems from mistakes in the design of its wing planform and the initial design of its rear fuselage.

Aside from the Bf 110 and Me 210/410, the Luftwaffe also utilized various light bombers, medium bombers, and &quot;Schnellbombers&quot; (German; literally &quot;fast bomber&quot;) in the heavy fighter role. Due to their relatively large size, these were mostly used as night fighter-bomber destroyers, as there was ample room to install airborne intercept radar systems as well as heavy armament. Bombers utilized in such a role included the Junkers Ju 88 and Ju 388; the Heinkel He 219; and the Dornier Do 215 and Do 217.

In addition to light and medium bombers, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; experimented with the concept of a &quot;Grosszerstörer&quot; (&quot;large destroyer&quot;). Different armament packages were tested on the Heinkel He 177 Greif heavy bomber. Twelve airframes, designated &quot; He 177 A-1/U2&quot;, carried twin 30 mm MK 101 cannon in an enlarged ventral gondola and was intended for ground attack, train busting, and possibly long-range anti-shipping raids. They also were intended for use in a bomber destroyer role, intercepting Allied long-range bombers and maritime patrol aircraft threatening the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;″s submarines. In the field, a small number of He 177 A-3s were also equipped with the 50 mmRheinmetall BK-5 cannon in the undernose gondola. This unofficial modification was intended for use in flak-suppression attacks. A never-built A-3/R5 variant was also planned to mount a 75 mm &quot;Bordkanone&quot; BK 7,5 cm cannon. Five A-5 variants were built, armed with up to 33 spin-stabilized 21 cm (8¼ in) calibre rockets obliquely mounted (firing upwards) in the fuselage, designed to break up and destroy the combat box defensive formations used by USAAF daylight bombers over Germany. Limited operational test flights were conducted with this variant, but they never made contact with the enemy; with the ever-increasing threat of Allied escort fighters, the variant was abandoned.

Towards the end of the war, the Dornier Do 335 &quot;Pfeil&quot; was developed as a twin-engine dedicated &quot;zerstörer&quot; (eschewing the usual German wartime practice of assigning multiple roles to heavy fighters), designed with a relatively unique push-pull configuration, which placed its fuselage-mounted twin DB 603 engines&#x27; propellers on opposing ends of the fuselage, and potentially allowed much better maneuverability, while essentially using the same engines as the conventional-layout twin-engine Me 410. The centre-line thrust design of the Do 335, the first-ever front-line combat fighter to use it, did allow dramatically higher speeds (just over 750 km/h or 465 mph) than many other twin-piston-engine aircraft of its era, but was never produced in quantity.

Following the example set by the Bf 110, the Japanese built the broadly similar Kawasaki Ki-45 &quot;Toryu&quot;. Likewise neutral Netherlands built the twin-boom Fokker G.I, only to be seized by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; after the German invasion of the Netherlands.

==United Kingdom==
Before the war the British sought two types of twin-engined fighters, with turret-mounted and nose-mounted (cannon) armament respectively. The former because it was expected to give greater opportunity for attack at higher speeds compared to the biplane era; the latter because of loss of accuracy expected with heavy weapons installed in wings. One example of an aircraft to meet the latter was the Gloster F.9/37; later development into a night-fighter was curtailed in 1941 so that Gloster&#x27;s design team could concentrate on British jet fighter projects. The limitations of pure turret fighters (though the single engine Boulton Paul Defiant was successfully adapted as a nightfighter) and aerodynamics of multiple cannon installations in turrets (such as Boulton Paul P.92) curtailed introduction of designs into service.

Perhaps in the belief that &quot;The bomber will always get through&quot;, Britain lagged behind in heavy fighter development. Apart from the Westland Whirlwind and the high-altitude Welkin, both built only in modest numbers (the former due to lack of engines, the latter due to changed requirement), the Royal Air Force&#x27;s wartime twin-engined fighters were all adapted from contemporary light bombers. During the German advance through Holland, Belgium and into France, squadrons using Bristol Blenheim 1Fs, fitted with a ventral gun pack and operating as long range fighters, suffered heavy losses, and were withdrawn from daylight operations. As the Battle of Britain commenced, some of these Blenheims were then equipped with radar, operating as night fighters.

More successful was the Bristol Beaufighter, started in 1938 as an interim aircraft to cover for delays in introduction of a cannon-armed fighter (the Westland Whirlwind). The Beaufighter design reused major portions of the earlier Beaufort torpedo bomber. Armed with six .303 inch (7.7 mm) machine guns, four 20 mm cannon and rockets, bombs or torpedoes, the Beaufighter was potent in the anti-ship and ground attack role in the Pacific and Europe. With the addition of radar, it was one of the Royal Air Force&#x27;s main night fighters. Similarly, the successful de Havilland Mosquito fast bomber was simultaneously adapted for both day and night fighter use. A parallel single-seat twin Merlin engine fighter the de Havilland Hornet entered service in the immediate post-war period and served until 1955.

When there appeared to be a threat from German high-altitude bombers, the Westland Welkin was developed. This was a twin engine design with wide wings () to be able to intercept at . The threat never materialised and Welkins did not see combat service. A contemporary design the six cannon armed Vickers Type 432, which itself descended from a requirement for a fighter with 40mm cannon, got no further than the prototype.

Due to the different requirements for naval fighter aircraft, the British put into service some heavyweight single-engine fighters such as the Fairey Firefly.

==United States==
The US military never officially designated an aircraft as a &quot;heavy fighter,&quot; but from the 1930s through to the immediate post-WWII period there were a slew of American designs that were twin-engined, relatively heavy in weight, and designed in line with other nations’ heavy fighter philosophy.

During the late 1930s, Bell Aircraft of the United States designed the YFM-1 Airacuda &quot;bomber destroyer&quot;. The design was heavily armed, particularly for a pre-WWII design, mounting two M4 cannons as her primary armament along with two M1919 Browning machine guns and two M2 Browning heavy machine guns for defense. A very large and unique airframe, the Airacuda was plagued with design flaws; only 13 prototypes were built, none of which participated in World War II.

The US would enter WWII with one of the most effective heavy fighters in history, the Lockheed P-38 Lightning. It was designed as a twin-engine bomber interceptor to climb quickly and carry heavy armament at high speed, with the lighter Bell P-39 Airacobra meeting the single-engine version of the same requirement. An advanced design crewed by a lone pilot, the P-38 performed best in the Pacific theater where its long-range proved a pivotal advantage. This range allowed a team of sixteen early P-38 models to intercept and kill Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto while he was traveling aboard a transport aircraft. The P-38 proved adaptable enough to undertake multiple roles including escort fighter, reconnaissance (as the F-4 and F-5 variants of which over 1,200 were built), night fighter (as the radar-equipped P-38M variant), and as a fighter-bomber. In the escort fighter role, the P-38 accompanied Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress raids deep into German-held Europe. The P-38 and the much lighter North American P-51 Mustang were the first two American fighters over Berlin in March 1944.

The only other American heavy fighter to serve in great numbers during WWII was the Northrop P-61 Black Widow, which was also the United States’ first dedicated night fighter, in addition to being the first aircraft designed to utilize radar. Armed with four forward-firing 20 mm (.79 in) AN/M2 cannons mounted in the lower fuselage and four .50 caliber (12.7 mm) Browning AN/M2 machine guns mounted in a remote-controlled dorsal gun turret (capable of firing forwards as well as rearwards for defense), it was one of the most heavily armed aircraft in American service during the WWII-period. The P-61 was unofficially credited with the last Allied air victory before VJ Day. The P-61 was also modified to create the unarmed F-15 Reporter, a specialized photo-reconnaissance aircraft for the United States Army Air Forces and subsequently used by the United States Air Force. The F-15 Reporter was the last piston-powered photo-reconnaissance aircraft designed and produced for the United States Air Force. The Reporter was also responsible for producing most of the aerial reconnaissance photographs of North Korea during the Korean War. The P-61 — redesignated as the F-61 in June 1948 — would also serve as a night/all-weather interceptor with the USAF&#x27;s Air Defense Command (ADC) until 1951.

In 1945, with the large-scale use of jet aircraft becoming commonplace, the United States Army Air Forces put forward technical specifications to the US aerospace industry, requesting both day and night interceptors. While the night interceptor technical specification did not specifically require jet power, it did place a minimum speed requirement of 503 mph (810 km/h) on the project, effectively necessitating jet power. By 1946, two aircraft were chosen by the USAAF to compete for the contract ; the Curtiss-Wright XP-87 Blackhawk and the Northrop XP-89 Scorpion. While the XP-89 would eventually emerge as the winner, due to multiple issues with both competing aircraft, the first Scorpions would not reach operational Air Defense Command interceptor units until 1951. With no other night interceptors to call on from 1945 to 1951, the P-61 Black Widow was charged with protecting American airspace from the growing threat of Soviet strategic bombers. The P-61 would be re-designated as the F-61 in 1948. With F-61s no longer in production post-war, they were usually replaced with the newer F-82 Twin Mustang once they became unserviceable.

The F-82 Twin Mustang was America&#x27;s last heavy fighter design as well as being the last American piston-engined fighter ordered into production by the United States. The Twin Mustang, while appearing to be simply a ‘twinned’ P-51 Mustang, actually only shared less than 20% commonality of parts with the original Mustang. Initially intended as a long-range escort fighter for Boeing B-29 Superfortress strategic bombers attacking the Japanese home islands, it would become operational only after the Japanese surrender. Originally designed in 1943, it was officially accepted into USAAF service in August 1945. The design carried six .50  in (12.7 mm) heavy machine guns (HMGs) on the ‘center’ wing, between each fuselage, with three on each outboard wing as on the original Mustang design. The HMGs were also AN/M3s instead of the original Mustang&#x27;s AN/M2 HMGs. The AN/M3 increased the rate of fire to around 1,200-1,300 rounds per minute (firing the same round with minimal change in weight or size) compared to the AN/M2&#x27;s 750-850 rounds per minute, a roughly 60% increase in rounds per minute. The first XP-82 prototype was equipped with a removable centerline gun pod housing eight additional .50 caliber M3 Brownings, but this did not feature on production aircraft. A separate centerline gun pod containing a cannon was considered, but was never built. The outer wings were reinforced to allow the addition of hard points for carrying additional fuel or of ordnance. The F-82E was the first operational model and its initial operational assignment was to the Strategic Air Command 27th Fighter Wing (later re-designated the 27th Fighter-Escort Wing, or 27th FEW) at Kearney Air Force Base, Nebraska in March 1948. With no long-range jet fighters to escort the strategic bomber force, the 27th FEW was to fly these missions in F-82Es.

During the start of the Korean War, the F-82 replaced the F-61 Black Widow as the USAF&#x27;s night interceptor in the Far East Air Forces. The Twin Mustang was utilized in the night fighter-interceptor and fighter-bomber role early in the war, and it scored the first US aerial victory, with Lt. William G. &quot;Skeeter&quot; Hudson, USAF, scoring a Yak-11 kill. The Twin Mustang was increasingly out-classed by jet aircraft, and was eventually replaced in Korea by Republic F-84 Thunderjets and North American F-86 Sabres.

The F-82 would end its life as the last operational American piston-engined interceptor. Primarily stationed in Alaska out of Adak Island (and later out of Ladd Air Force Base) as part of the 449th Fighter (All-Weather) Squadron (F(AW)S), a winterized variant, known as the F-82H was developed specifically for this task. The winterized Twin Mustang would perform long-range aerial patrols over the extremes of American airspace around Alaska, with the area being viewed as a possible ‘back door’ for Soviet strategic bombers. The F-82H was slowly supplemented by the Lockheed F-94 Starfire all-weather interceptor, and by 1953, it had completely replaced the Twin Mustang.

Apart from the P-38 and P-61, other mid-WWII projects included the proposed Curtis XP-71. It was an exceptionally large heavy fighter, intended to serve as a long-range escort fighter and bomber destroyer. Its design was based around a 75 mm cannon capable of destroying large heavy bombers with one hit, but interest in the project waned and the -wingspan aircraft did not progress beyond a single mockup. Another bomber destroyer was the Beechcraft Model 28, also bearing a 75 mm cannon, with twin turrets mounting .50 in (12.7 mm) Browning AN/M2 heavy machine guns for defence. The design was re-designated the XA-38 Grizzly and was repurposed as a ground attack aircraft intended to be able to defeat enemy tanks and ground fortifications with its heavy cannon. However, for reasons including need of the chosen powerplant for B-29 bombers it did not enter service.

Post-war, the Grumman F7F Tigercat was the first twin-engine fighter aircraft to enter service with the United States Navy, using two Pratt &amp; Whitney Double Wasp radial engines, achieving a top speed of 460 mph (740 km/h). It was among the fastest piston-engine aircraft ever built, and heavily armed with four 20mm M2 cannon and four 0.50 in (12.7 mm) Browning AN/M2 heavy machine guns, with hard points for bombs or a torpedo. Although Grumman designed and developed the aircraft during World War II, it entered service too late to see action before VJ Day. It served in the Korean War and retired in 1954.

==USSR==

During the interwar period the USSR set about developing heavily armed twin-engine fighters to function in the heavy-fighter role, particularly as interceptors and bomber destroyers. Uniquely, the Soviets experimented with recoilless rifles as primary armament, but abandoned the effort as impractical in the late 1930s. Twin-engine designs such as the Tupolev ANT-29 or Petlyakov VI-100 were proposed, but never made it past the prototype stage, and the USSR entered World War II without a viable heavy fighter.

With the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the Soviet Air Forces were caught off-guard; with only lighter, single-engined, relatively lightly armed fighters to intercept Luftwaffe bombers, and no dedicated night fighters (a role typically filled by heavy fighters). After the German night bombing raids of Moscow in 1941, the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Defense of the Soviet Union (NKO) sought to rapidly correct this deficiency. In order to create a fighter that would fill the needed specifications quickly, it was determined that it would utilize a pre-existing airframe. The NKO selected the Petlyakov Pe-2 – a twin-engined light bomber – to be modified, and within 4 days the newly minted Petlyakov Pe-3 took flight.

Numerous issues were identified with the Pe-3, primarily stemming from the added gun and cannon armament. Various improvements, workarounds, and modifications were tested to address these issues. The aircraft was placed under further scrutiny when it was issued on a trial-basis to the 95th High-Speed Bomber Regiment within the Moscow Military District in late 1941. The Regiment&#x27;s experiences revealed further deficiencies not found during initial testing; Firing the aircraft&#x27;s forward-facing armament at night temporarily blinded the pilots, crews complained about a lack of frontal armor, and heavier armament in general was requested. Ground crews would rectify two of these issues on their own; flash-hiders were installed on the forward armament, and RS-82 and RS-132 rocket launchers were sometimes mounted for ground-attack missions, while a DAG-10 aerial grenade launcher was occasionally mounted in the tail.

Most of the problems found during trials and operational field-testing would be rectified by the Petlyakov Design Bureau with the introduction of the Pe-3bis (Pe-3 &#x27;Improved&#x27;). Pe-3bis production began in April 1942, although 207 standard Pe-3s were produced in the intervening months. However, additional issues were again discovered with the Pe-3bis, and in May 1942 the Petlyakov Design Bureau switched production over to a Pe-3bis with further minor modifications; no name or designation change was made.

A reconnaissance variant, with an onboard camera system and greater range was also produced in small numbers; This variant was often referred to as either the Pe-3R or Pe-3F.

The Pe-3 and Pe-3bis would serve as the only widely fielded heavy fighter of the Soviet Air Forces during WWII. Other heavy fighter designs; such as the Grushin Gr-1, Mikoyan-Gurevich DIS, Polikarpov TIS, and the Tairov Ta-3; were proposed, but never moved beyond test stages.

== After World War II ==

Like other military types, piston-engine heavy fighters such as the de Havilland Hornet and Sea Hornet, as well as the North American F-82 Twin Mustang continued in service in the years immediately after the war. All were developed at the end of World War II for use in the Pacific theatre, though none reached operational squadrons until after VJ day, the Hornet in 1946, the Sea Hornet in 1947 and the Twin Mustang in 1948.

4th-generation and 5th-generation air superiority fighters are designed to wrest air superiority from the enemy in hostile territory, and thus usually have greater range than tactical fighters or interceptors. They therefore typically have two engines, and often carry a larger number of air-to-air missiles than their smaller brethren. They typically also have more capable and complex radar and electronic systems, with the result that in older air-superiority fighters such as the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II or Grumman F-14 Tomcat, a second dedicated crew member was carried to manage radar and weapon-systems.

<text>Ali Ahmeti (; born 4 January 1959), also known by the nom de guerre as Abaz Gjuka () is a Macedonian politician of Albanian descent, leader of the Democratic Union for Integration, and a junior coalition partner in the Macedonian government from 2008 to 2024. Ahmeti was the political leader of the former Albanian National Liberation Army in the 2001 insurgency in Macedonia.

==Life==
Ali Ahmeti was born on 4 January 1959, in Zajas, SR Macedonia, SFR Yugoslavia. From 1979 to 1983, Ahmeti studied philosophy at the University of Pristina in Kosovo, graduating in 1983. Between 1981 and 1983, he also was one of the student leaders in the 1981 protests in Kosovo. For these activities, Ahmeti was arrested and imprisoned for one year by the Serbian and Yugoslav authorities.

Between 1984 and 1986, he was involved with the reconsolidation of the student movement (and general popular movement) in Kosovo. In 1986, Ahmeti gained political asylum in Switzerland, where he lived until 2001, and was working as a coordinator of different groups.

From 1988 to 1989, he was one of the leaders of the student and miners&#x27; protests against the Milosevic government. From 1989 to 1990, he was one of the main organizers of protests of the Albanian diaspora in Europe.

Ahmeti gained his political support from the National Movement for the Liberation of Kosovo. In the year 1986, he was elected as a member of the Main Council with a specific duty, interconnecting Kosovo with Europe. In the year 1988, he was elected as a member of the leadership of the National Movement of Kosovo. He was re-elected in this position in 1993, with a special duty in the military sector.

In 1996, he was one of the main founders of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), and in 1998, when the war started, he was elected member of the main staff of the KLA. In 2001, he was elected Supreme Commander and political representative of the National Liberation Army (NLA). 

After the signing of the Ohrid Agreement in August 2001, and the disarmament of the NLA in September, Ahmeti was engaged in the political process of the implementation of the agreement. In this light, he initiated and was named as a leader of the Coordination Council which unified all Albanian political parties in Macedonia, and the former structures of the NLA.

In June 2002, Ahmeti founded a new political party called the Democratic Union for Integration. In September 2002, DUI won the elections among Albanian parties in the republic and Ahmeti was elected as a deputy in the Macedonian Parliament. DUI entered in coalition with the winning party from the Macedonian block, Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM). In 2008, DUI entered in coalition with VMRO-DPMNE.

On 26 November 2019, an earthquake struck Albania. Ahmeti was part of a delegation of Albanian politicians from North Macedonia visiting the earthquake epicentre that expressed their condolences to the Albanian president Ilir Meta.

In September 2020, Ahmeti testified to prosecutors at the Kosovo Specialist Chambers regarding war crimes in the Kosovo War. In May 2024, he was honored with the title &quot;Honorary Citizen of Tirana&quot; in Albania.

<text>Izaak Walton (baptised 21 September 1593 – 15 December 1683) was an English writer. Best known as the author of &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;, he also wrote a number of short biographies including one of his friend John Donne. They have been collected under the title of &quot;Walton&#x27;s Lives&quot;.

Born at Stafford around 1593, Walton moved to London in his teens, where he worked as a linen draper. In the capital, he befriended the poet and clergyman John Donne. A Royalist during the English Civil War, Walton returned to his home county of Staffordshire, settling at Shallowford, following the Royalist defeat at Marston Moor in 1644. Though Walton had returned to London by 1650, his experiences at Shallowford provided material for &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;: a celebration of the art and spirit of fishing, first published in 1653. Throughout his life, Walton published biographies of subjects including Donne and Henry Wotton. These were later collected as Walton&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot;.

Walton&#x27;s literary admirers have included Charles Lamb and he gives his name to places and organisations in his native country, the United States, and Kenya. Walton left his residence at Shallowford to the local poor. It is now maintained as a museum to his legacy.
==Biography==
Walton was born at Stafford in 1593. The register of his baptism on 21 September 1593 gives his father&#x27;s name as &quot;Jervis&quot;, or Gervase. His father, who was an innkeeper as well as a landlord of a tavern, died before Izaak was three, being buried in February 1596/7 as &quot;Jarvicus Walton&quot;. His mother then married another innkeeper by the name of Bourne, who later ran the Swan in Stafford. Izaak also had a brother named Ambrose, as indicated by an entry in the parish register recording the burial in March 1595/6 of an &quot;Ambrosius filius Jervis Walton&quot;.

His date of birth is traditionally given as 9 August 1593. However, this date is based on a misinterpretation of his will, which he began on 9 August 1683.

He is believed to have been educated in Stafford before moving to London in his teens. He is often described as an ironmonger, but he trained as a linen draper, a trade which came under the Ironmongers&#x27; Company. He had a small shop in the upper storey of Thomas Gresham&#x27;s Royal Burse or Exchange in Cornhill. In 1614 he had a shop in Fleet Street, two doors west of Chancery Lane in the parish of St Dunstan&#x27;s. He became verger and churchwarden of the church, and a friend of the vicar, John Donne. He joined the Ironmongers&#x27; Company in November 1618.
Walton&#x27;s first wife was Rachel Floud (married December 1626), a great-great-niece of Archbishop Cranmer. She died in 1640. He soon remarried, to Anne Ken (m. 1641?-1662), who appears as the pastoral &quot;Kenna&quot; of &quot;The Angler&#x27;s Wish&quot;; she was a stepsister of Thomas Ken, afterwards bishop of Bath and Wells.

After the Royalist defeat at Marston Moor in 1644, Walton retired from his trade. The last forty years of his life were spent visiting eminent clergymen and others who enjoyed fishing, compiling the biographies of people he liked, and collecting information for the &quot;Compleat Angler&quot;. 

He went to live just north of his birthplace, at a spot between the towns of Stafford and Stone, where he had bought some land edged by a small river. His new land at Shallowford included a farm, and a parcel of land; however by 1650 he was living in Clerkenwell, London.

He published the first of his several biographies of clergymen, a life of John Donne, in 1640. The first edition of his most famous book,&quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;, was published in 1653. It was expanded and republished in four additional editions.

Following the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 it was disclosed that Izaak was a staunch Royalist supporter who had aided the Royalists when, at great personal risk, he managed to safeguard one of the Crown Jewels, referred to as the Little George, following Charles II&#x27;s defeat at the battle of Worcester. Walton was entrusted with returning it to London from where it was smuggled out of the country to Charles II who was then in exile.

His second wife died in 1662, and was buried in Worcester Cathedral, where there is a monument to her memory. One of his daughters married Dr Hawkins, a prebendary of Winchester.

After 1662 he found a home at Farnham Castle with George Morley, Bishop of Winchester, to whom he dedicated his &quot;Life of George Herbert&quot; and his biography of Richard Hooker. He sometimes visited Charles Cotton in his fishing house on the River Dove.

Walton died, aged 90, in his daughter&#x27;s house at Winchester on 15 December 1683 and was buried in Winchester Cathedral.

===&quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;===


&quot;The Compleat Angler&quot; was first published in 1653, but Walton continued to add to it for a quarter of a century. It is a celebration of the art and spirit of fishing in prose and verse; 6 verses were quoted from John Dennys&#x27;s 1613 work &quot;The Secrets of Angling&quot;. It was dedicated to John Offley, his most honoured friend. There was a second edition in 1655, a third in 1661 (identical with that of 1664), a fourth in 1668 and a fifth in 1676. In this last edition the thirteen chapters of the original had grown to twenty-one, and a second part was added by his friend and brother angler Charles Cotton, who took up Venator where Walton had left him and completed his instruction in fly fishing and the making of flies.

Walton did not profess to be an expert with a fishing fly; the fly fishing in his first edition was contributed by Thomas Barker, a retired cook and humorist, who published a treatise of his own, &quot;The Art of Angling&quot; in 1651; but in the use of the live worm, the grasshopper and the frog &quot;Piscator&quot; himself could speak as a master. The famous passage about the frog, often misquoted as being about the worm—&quot;use him as though you loved him, that is, harm him as little as you may possibly, that he may live the longer&quot;—appears in the original edition. The additions made as the work grew did not affect the technical part alone; quotations, new turns of phrase, songs, poems and anecdotes were introduced as if the author, who wrote it as a recreation, had kept it constantly in his mind and talked it over point by point with his many friends. There were originally only two interlocutors in the opening scene, &quot;Piscator&quot; and &quot;Viator&quot;; but in the second edition, as if in answer to an objection that &quot;Piscator&quot; had it too much in his own way in praise of angling, he introduced the falconer, &quot;Auceps,&quot; changed &quot;Viator&quot; into &quot;Venator&quot; and made the new companions each dilate on the joys of his favourite sport.

The best-known old edition of the &quot;Angler&quot; is J. Major&#x27;s (2nd ed., 1824). The book was edited by Andrew Lang in 1896, followed by many other editions.

===Walton&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot;===
Walton made significant contributions to seventeenth-century life-writing throughout his career. His leisurely labours as a biographer seem to have grown out of his devotion to angling. It was probably as an angler that he made the acquaintance of Sir Henry Wotton, but it is clear that Walton had more than a love of fishing and a humorous temper to recommend him to Wotton&#x27;s friendship. At any rate, Wotton, who had intended to write the life of John Donne, and had already corresponded with Walton on the subject, left the task to him. Walton had already contributed an elegy to the 1633 edition of Donne&#x27;s poems, and he completed and published the life, much to the satisfaction of the most learned critics, in 1640. Sir Henry Wotton dying in 1639, Walton undertook his life also; it was finished in 1642 and published in 1651 as a preface to the volume &quot;Reliquiae Wottonianae&quot;. His life of Hooker was published in 1665, and his biography of George Herbert in 1670, the latter coinciding with a collected edition of Walton&#x27;s biographical writings, &quot;The Lives of Dr. John Donne, Sir Henry Wotton, Mr. Richard Hooker, Mr. George Herbert&quot; (1670, 1675). His life of Bishop Robert Sanderson appeared in 1678. All these subjects were endeared to Walton by a certain gentleness of disposition and cheerful piety; three of them at least—Donne, Wotton and Herbert—were anglers. Walton studied these men&#x27;s lives in detail, and provides many insights into their character.

==Legacy==
===Izaak Walton&#x27;s Cottage===

In his will, Walton left his property at Shallowford in Staffordshire for the benefit of the poor of his native town. He had purchased Halfhead Farm there in May 1655. In doing this he was part of a more general retreat of Royalist gentlemen into the English countryside, in the aftermath of the English Civil War, a move summed up by his friend Charles Cotton&#x27;s well-known poem &quot;The Retirement&quot; (first published in the 5th edition of Walton&#x27;s &quot;Compleat Angler&quot;). The cost of Shallowford was £350, and the property included a farmhouse, a cottage, courtyard, garden and nine fields along which a river ran. Part of its attraction may have been that the River Meece, which he mentions in one of his poems, formed part of the boundary. The farm was let to tenants, and Walton kept the excellent fishing.

The cottage is now a Walton Museum. The ground floor of the museum is set-out in period, with information boards covering Walton&#x27;s life, his writings and the story of the Izaak Walton Cottage. Upstairs a collection of fishing related items is displayed, the earliest dating from the mid-eighteenth century, while a room is dedicated to his &quot;Lives&quot; and &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;. The Izaak Walton Cottage and gardens are open to the public on Sunday afternoons during the summer.
===Commemorations===
Advertising mogul and land developer Barron Collier founded the Izaak Walton Fly Fishing Club in 1908 at his Useppa Island resort near Fort Myers, Florida. The Izaak Walton League is an American association formed in 1922 in Chicago, Illinois, to preserve fishing streams. Walton has been inducted into the American National Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame. There is a forest preserve in Homewood, Illinois, called the Izaak Walton Forest Preserve. The Izaak Walton Hotel in the Staffordshire village of Ilam overlooks the River Dove, at the entrance to Dovedale. There are also two pubs in England named The Izaak Walton: one in the village of East Meon, Hampshire, the other in Cresswell, Staffordshire. In the county town of Stafford, there is now a statue of him placed in the town park, by the bank of the river. This route through the park was originally known as &#x27;Izaak Walton Walk&#x27;, there is also a street in the north part of Stafford named after him.

There is a creek named after him in Owatonna, Minnesota. There is also a pub in Norwich named &#x27;The Compleat Angler&#x27;. The Compleat Angler Hotel in Bimini, Bahamas, was destroyed by fire in 2006; the hotel bar was frequented by Ernest Hemingway. The Allen-Edmonds shoe company of Port Washington, Wisconsin, produces a &quot;Walton&quot; style in tribute. In the Silver Divide region of the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California, Mount Izaak Walton is named after Izaak Walton. The Izaak Walton State Recreation Site in Sterling, Alaska, is located at the confluence of the Moose River and the Kenai River, and his name is lent to the Izaak Walton Inn in Montana. There is an Izaak Walton Inn in Embu, Kenya, overlooking a small stream that feeds into the Rupingazi River.
===Non-fiction===
* Charles Lamb, in his letter to Samuel Taylor Coleridge, recommends the &quot;Compleat Angler&quot;: &quot;It breathes the very spirit of innocence, purity, and simplicity of the heart. There are many choice old verses interspersed in it; it would sweeten a man&#x27;s temper at any time to read it; it would Christianise every discordant angry passion; pray make yourself acquainted with it.&quot;

* Gilbert Ryle uses him in his 1949 book &quot;The Concept of Mind&quot; as an example of &quot;&#x27;knowing how&#x27; before &#x27;knowing that&#x27;&quot;; in his collected essays he writes that &quot;We certainly can, in respect of many practices, like fishing, cooking and reasoning, extract principles from their applications by people who know how to fish, cook and reason. Hence Isaak Walton, Mrs Beeton and Aristotle. But when we try to express these principles we find that they cannot easily be put in the indicative mood. They fall automatically into the imperative mood.&quot;
===Fiction===
* Charles Dickens makes reference to him in chapter 14 of book 2 of &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;. &quot;The honoured parent steering Northward, had not gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and the two trudged on together.&quot;
* Walton is mentioned by Thomas Hardy in his 1891 &quot;A Group of Noble Dames&quot;, where his relation to fish is compared to the relation of the Petrick family towards the aristocracy.
* Zane Grey mentions him in a fishing passage in his 1903 book &quot;Betty Zane&quot; on page 84. &quot;Alfred Clark said &#x27;I never knew one (girl) who cared for fishing.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Betty Zane answered &#x27;Now you behold one. I love dear old Izaak Walton. Of course you (Clark) have read his book?&#x27;&quot;
* Richard Brautigan describes Communists carrying &quot;propaganda posters&quot; in a &quot;trout fishing in America peace parade&quot; with slogans including &quot;ISAAC WALTON [sic] WOULD&#x27;VE HATED THE BOMB!&quot; in his 1967 book &quot;Trout Fishing in America.&quot;
* Donna Tartt references him in &quot;The Secret History&quot; when the character Bunny writes an essay which over-emphasises his friendship with John Donne.
*Jules Verne references him in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot; when the author refers to making fishing lines in the fashion of Izaak Walton.
*David James Duncan employs Walton&#x27;s &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot; to comedic effect throughout the early chapters of his novel of fishing and spiritual development, &quot;The River Why&quot; (1983).
*In the film &quot;School Ties&quot; (1992) the history teacher refers to Izaak Walton as a personal favourite after mentioning the date of his birth to see if any students knew it.
*A ghostly Walton appears in &quot;Over the Edge&quot; by Peter Wise in &quot;Disturbing the Water&quot;, a collection of themed original ghost stories set around rivers and lakes.

<doc id="164897" wikidata="Q2430501" url="?curid=164897" title="Three-domain system">
<text>The three-domain system is a taxonomic classification system that groups all cellular life into three domains, namely Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya, introduced by Carl Woese, Otto Kandler and Mark Wheelis in 1990. The key difference from earlier classifications such as the two-empire system and the five-kingdom classification is the splitting of Archaea (previously named &quot;archaebacteria&quot;) from Bacteria as completely different organisms. 

The three domain hypothesis is considered obsolete by some since it is thought that eukaryotes do not form a separate domain of life; instead, they arose from a fusion between two different species, one from within Archaea and one from within Bacteria. (see Two-domain system)

==Background==
Woese argued, on the basis of differences in 16S rRNA genes, that bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes each arose separately from an ancestor with poorly developed genetic machinery, often called a progenote. To reflect these primary lines of descent, he treated each as a domain, divided into several different kingdoms. Originally his split of the prokaryotes was into &quot;Eubacteria&quot; (now &quot;Bacteria&quot;) and &quot;Archaebacteria&quot; (now &quot;Archaea&quot;). Woese initially used the term &quot;kingdom&quot; to refer to the three primary phylogenic groupings, and this nomenclature was widely used until the term &quot;domain&quot; was adopted in 1990.

Acceptance of the validity of Woese&#x27;s phylogenetically valid classification was a slow process. Prominent biologists including Salvador Luria and Ernst Mayr objected to his division of the prokaryotes. Not all criticism of him was restricted to the scientific level. A decade of labor-intensive oligonucleotide cataloging left him with a reputation as &quot;a crank&quot;, and Woese would go on to be dubbed &quot;Microbiology&#x27;s Scarred Revolutionary&quot; by a news article printed in the journal &quot;Science&quot; in 1997. The growing amount of supporting data led the scientific community to accept the Archaea by the mid-1980s. Today, very few scientists still accept the concept of a unified Prokarya.

== Classification ==

The three-domain system adds a level of classification (the domains) &quot;above&quot; the kingdoms present in the previously used five- or six-kingdom systems. This classification system recognizes the fundamental divide between the two prokaryotic groups, insofar as Archaea appear to be more closely related to eukaryotes than they are to other prokaryotes – bacteria-like organisms with no cell nucleus. The three-domain system sorts the previously known kingdoms into these three domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya.

===Domain Archaea===
The Archaea are prokaryotic, with no nuclear membrane, but with biochemistry and RNA markers that are distinct from bacteria. The archaeans possess unique, ancient evolutionary history for which they are considered some of the oldest species of organisms on Earth, most notably their diverse, exotic metabolisms.

Some examples of archaeal organisms are:
* methanogens – which produce the gas methane
* halophiles – which live in very salty water
* thermoacidophiles – which thrive in acidic high-temperature water

===Domain Bacteria===
The Bacteria are also prokaryotic; their domain consists of cells with bacterial rRNA, no nuclear membrane, and whose membranes possess primarily &quot;diacyl glycerol diester lipids&quot;. Traditionally classified as bacteria, many thrive in the same environments favored by humans, and were the first prokaryotes discovered; they were briefly called the Eubacteria or &quot;true&quot; bacteria when the Archaea were first recognized as a distinct clade.

Most known pathogenic prokaryotic organisms belong to bacteria (see for exceptions). For that reason, and because the Archaea are typically difficult to grow in laboratories, Bacteria are currently studied more extensively than Archaea.

Some examples of bacteria include:
* &quot;Cyanobacteria&quot; – photosynthesizing bacteria that are related to the chloroplasts of eukaryotic plants and algae
* Spirochaetota – Gram-negative bacteria that include those causing syphilis and Lyme disease
* Actinomycetota – Gram-positive bacteria including &quot;Bifidobacterium animalis&quot; which is present in the human large intestine

===Domain Eukarya===
Eukaryota are organisms whose cells contain a membrane-bound nucleus. They include many large single-celled organisms and all known non-microscopic organisms. The domain contains, for example:

* Holomycota – mushrooms and allies
* Viridiplantae – green plants
* Holozoa – animals and allies
* Stramenopiles – includes brown algae
* Amoebozoa – solitary and social amoebae
* Discoba – includes euglenoids

==Niches==
Each of the three cell types tends to fit into recurring specialities or roles. Bacteria tend to be the most prolific reproducers, at least in moderate environments. Archaeans tend to adapt quickly to extreme environments, such as high temperatures, high acids, high sulfur, etc. This includes adapting to use a wide variety of food sources. Eukaryotes are the most flexible with regard to forming cooperative colonies, such as in multi-cellular organisms, including humans. In fact, the structure of a eukaryote is likely to have derived from a joining of different cell types, forming organelles.

&quot;Parakaryon myojinensis&quot; (&quot;incertae sedis&quot;) is a single-celled organism known to be a unique example. &quot;This organism appears to be a life form distinct from prokaryotes and eukaryotes&quot;, with features of both.

==Alternatives==

Parts of the three-domain theory have been challenged by scientists including Ernst Mayr, Thomas Cavalier-Smith, and Radhey S. Gupta.

Recent work has proposed that Eukaryota may have actually branched off from the domain Archaea. According to Spang &quot;et al.&quot;, Lokiarchaeota forms a monophyletic group with eukaryotes in phylogenomic analyses. The associated genomes also encode an expanded repertoire of eukaryotic signature proteins that are suggestive of sophisticated membrane remodelling capabilities. This work suggests a two-domain system as opposed to the three-domain system. Exactly how and when Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya developed and how they are related continues to be debated.

<doc id="164901" wikidata="Q898362" url="?curid=164901" title="Post-translational modification">
<text>In molecular biology, post-translational modification (PTM) is the covalent process of changing proteins following protein biosynthesis. PTMs may involve enzymes or occur spontaneously. Proteins are created by ribosomes, which translate mRNA into polypeptide chains, which may then change to form the mature protein product. PTMs are important components in cell signalling, as for example when prohormones are converted to hormones.

Post-translational modifications can occur on the amino acid side chains or at the protein&#x27;s C- or N- termini. They can expand the chemical set of the 22 amino acids by changing an existing functional group or adding a new one such as phosphate. Phosphorylation is highly effective for controlling the enzyme activity and is the most common change after translation. Many eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins also have carbohydrate molecules attached to them in a process called glycosylation, which can promote protein folding and improve stability as well as serving regulatory functions. Attachment of lipid molecules, known as lipidation, often targets a protein or part of a protein attached to the cell membrane.

Other forms of post-translational modification consist of cleaving peptide bonds, as in processing a propeptide to a mature form or removing the initiator methionine residue. The formation of disulfide bonds from cysteine residues may also be referred to as a post-translational modification. For instance, the peptide hormone insulin is cut twice after disulfide bonds are formed, and a propeptide is removed from the middle of the chain; the resulting protein consists of two polypeptide chains connected by disulfide bonds.

Some types of post-translational modification are consequences of oxidative stress. Carbonylation is one example that targets the modified protein for degradation and can result in the formation of protein aggregates. Specific amino acid modifications can be used as biomarkers indicating oxidative damage.
PTMs and metal ions play a crucial and reciprocal role in regulating protein function, influencing cellular processes such as signal transduction and gene expression, with dysregulated interactions implicated in diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders .

Sites that often undergo post-translational modification are those that have a functional group that can serve as a nucleophile in the reaction: the hydroxyl groups of serine, threonine, and tyrosine; the amine forms of lysine, arginine, and histidine; the thiolate anion of cysteine; the carboxylates of aspartate and glutamate; and the N- and C-termini. In addition, although the amide of asparagine is a weak nucleophile, it can serve as an attachment point for glycans. Rarer modifications can occur at oxidized methionines and at some methylene groups in side chains.

Post-translational modification of proteins can be experimentally detected by a variety of techniques, including mass spectrometry, Eastern blotting, and Western blotting.

=== Common PTMs by residue ===
Some common post-translational modifications to specific amino-acid residues are shown below. Modifications occur on the side-chain unless indicated otherwise.

== Databases and tools ==

Protein sequences contain sequence motifs that are recognized by modifying enzymes, and which can be documented or predicted in PTM databases. With the large number of different modifications being discovered, there is a need to document this sort of information in databases. PTM information can be collected through experimental means or predicted from high-quality, manually curated data. Numerous databases have been created, often with a focus on certain taxonomic groups (e.g. human proteins) or other features.

<text>General Mills, Inc. is an American multinational manufacturer and marketer of branded processed consumer foods sold through retail stores. Founded on the banks of the Mississippi River at Saint Anthony Falls in Minneapolis, the company originally gained fame for being a large flour miller. It is headquartered in Golden Valley, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.

Today, the company markets many well-known North American brands, including Gold Medal flour, Annie&#x27;s Homegrown, Lärabar, Cascadian Farm, Betty Crocker, Nature Valley, Totino&#x27;s, Pillsbury, Old El Paso, Häagen-Dazs, as well as breakfast cereals under the General Mills name, including Cheerios, Wheaties, Chex, Lucky Charms, Trix, Cocoa Puffs, and the monster cereals.

==History==
=== Washburn-Crosby Company ===
The company can trace its history to the Minneapolis Milling Company, incorporated in 1856. The company was founded by Illinois Congressman Robert Smith, who leased power rights to flour mills operating along the west side of Saint Anthony Falls on the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Cadwallader C. Washburn acquired the company shortly after its founding and hired his brother William D. Washburn to assist in the company&#x27;s development. In 1866 the Washburns got into the business themselves, building the Washburn &quot;B&quot; Mill at the falls. At the time, the building was considered to be so large and output so vast that it could not possibly sustain itself. However, the company succeeded, and in 1874 he built the even bigger Washburn &quot;A&quot; Mill.

In 1877, the mill entered a partnership with John Crosby to form the Washburn-Crosby Company, producing winter wheat flour. That same year Washburn sent William Hood Dunwoody to England to open the market for spring wheat. Dunwoody was successful and became a silent partner.

In 1878, the &quot;A&quot; mill was destroyed in a flour dust explosion along with five nearby buildings, an event known as the Great Mill Disaster. The ensuing fire led to the death of 18 workers. Construction of a new mill began immediately. Not only was the new mill safer but it also was able to produce a higher quality flour after the old grinding stones were replaced with automatic steel rollers, the first ever used.

In 1880, Washburn-Crosby flour brands won gold, silver and bronze medals at the Millers&#x27; International Exhibition in Cincinnati, causing them to launch the Gold Medal flour brand.

In 1924, the company acquired a failing Twin Cities radio station, WLAG, renaming it WCCO (from Washburn-Crosby Company).

===Founding as General Mills===
General Mills itself was created on June 20, 1928, when Washburn-Crosby President James Ford Bell merged Washburn-Crosby with three other mills. In the same year, General Mills acquired the Wichita Mill and Elevator Company of the industrialist Frank Kell of Wichita Falls, Texas. With the sale, Kell acquired cash plus stock in the corporation.
Shares of the new company&#x27;s stock were first sold on the New York Stock Exchange on November 30, 1928, at $65 per share. The newly merged company paid a dividend in 1928 and has continued the dividend uninterrupted ever since – one of only a few companies to pay a dividend every year since its founding.

===Engineering milestones===

In the 1930s, General Mills engineer, Thomas R. James, created the puffing gun, which inflated or distorted cereal pieces into puffed-up shapes. This new technology was used in 1937 to create Kix cereal and in 1941 to create Cheerioats (known today as Cheerios).
In 1939, General Mills engineer Helmer Anderson created the Anderson sealer. This new device allowed for bags of flour to be sealed with glue instead of just being tied with a string.
In 1956, General Mills created the tear-strip for easily opening packages.

===Aeronautical Research Division and Electronics Division===
In 1946, General Mills established their Aeronautical Research Division with chief engineer Otto C. Winzen. This division developed high altitude balloons in conjunction with the United States Navy Office of Naval Research (ONR), such as the Skyhook balloon.

In 1956, hundreds of General Mills balloons carrying reconnaissance equipment were launched by the United States government under Project Genetrix to surveil Eastern bloc countries, in particular their nuclear capabilities.

The aeronautical work of General Mills done around the time of the Second World War was continued by Raven Industries.

The General Mills Electronics division developed the DSV &quot;Alvin&quot; submersible, which is notable for being used in investigating the wreck of &quot;Titanic&quot; among other deep-sea exploration missions.

===Merchandising and television===
Beginning in 1929, General Mills products contained box top coupons, known as Betty Crocker coupons, with varying point values, which were redeemable for discounts on a variety of housewares products featured in the widely distributed Betty Crocker catalog. The coupons and the catalog were discontinued by the company in 2006.

General Mills became the sponsor of the popular radio show &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; in 1941. The show was then brought to television, and, after 20 years, their sponsorship came to an end in 1961.
Beginning in 1959, General Mills sponsored the &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot; television series, later known as &quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot;. Until 1968, Rocky and Bullwinkle were featured in a variety of advertisements for General Mills. General Mills was also a sponsor of the Saturday-morning cartoons from the Total Television productions studio, including Tennessee Tuxedo. The company also was a sponsor of the ABC western series &quot;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot;, starring Hugh O&#x27;Brian. The company, along with its subsidiary The Program Exchange, backed DiC Entertainment in syndicating the &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; animated series based on the comic strip of the same name created by Hank Ketcham in 1986. From 1997 until May 31, 2004, General Mills sponsored and syndicated the first 82 episodes of the original &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; English dub (the remaining 17 of 82 episodes premiered on Cartoon Network&#x27;s programming block Toonami in 1998).

===Diversification: toys and restaurants===
The first venture General Mills took into the toy industry was in 1965. The company bought Rainbow Crafts, which was the manufacturer of Play-Doh. General Mills&#x27;s purchase of the company was significant because it brought production costs down and tripled the revenue.

In 1967, General Mills bought the Kenner toy company.

General Mills came out with their &quot;monster cereals&quot; in the 1970s. The cereals are now produced and sold seasonally around Halloween.

In 1970, General Mills acquired a five-unit restaurant company called Red Lobster and expanded it nationwide. Soon, a division of General Mills titled General Mills Restaurants developed to take charge of the Red Lobster chain. In 1980, General Mills acquired the California-based Good Earth health food restaurant chain. The company eventually converted the restaurants into other chain restaurants they were operating, such as Red Lobster. In 1982, General Mills Restaurants founded a new Italian-themed restaurant chain called Olive Garden. Another themed restaurant, China Coast, was added before the entire group was spun off to General Mills shareholders in 1995 as Darden Restaurants.

During the same decade, General Mills ventured further, starting the General Mills Specialty Retail Group. They acquired two clothing and apparel companies, Talbots and Eddie Bauer. The acquisition was short-lived. Talbots was purchased by a Japanese company, then known as JUSCO, and the Spiegel company purchased Bauer. Spiegel later declared bankruptcy, yet Bauer still remains, albeit in a smaller presence in the United States today.

From 1976 to 1985, General Mills went to court as the parent company of Parker Brothers, which held the rights on the brand name and gaming idea of the board game &quot;Monopoly&quot;, claiming that the so-called Anti-Monopoly game of an economics professor infringed their trademark. The dispute extended up to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled against them, saying that while they have exclusive rights to the game &quot;Monopoly&quot;, they cannot prevent others from using the word &quot;monopoly&quot; in the name of a game.

In 1985, General Mills&#x27;s toy division was separated from its parent as Kenner Parker Toys, Inc. There were many potential acquirers of the business but it was floated on the stock exchange with General Mills&#x27;s shareholders getting equivalent shares in Kenner Parker. This was more tax efficient for General Mills.

===Recent history===
In 1990, a joint venture with Nestlé S.A. called Cereal Partners was formed which markets cereals (including many existing General Mills cereal brands) outside the US and Canada under the Nestlé name.

In 2001, the company purchased Pillsbury (sans Burger King) from Diageo, although it was officially described as a &quot;merger&quot;.

Since 2004, General Mills has been producing more products targeted to the growing ranks of health-conscious consumers. The company has chosen to switch its entire breakfast cereal line to whole grain. The company also started manufacturing their child-targeted cereals with less sugar. General Mills has reduced the level of sugar in all cereals advertised to children to 11 grams per serving.

In April 2011, General Mills announced that it will switch all 1 million eggs it uses each year to cage-free.

General Mills was ranked #181 on the 2012 Fortune 500 list of America&#x27;s largest corporations, 161 in 2015 and was the third-largest food consumer products company in the United States. During June 2012, the company&#x27;s vice-president for diversity stated that General Mills opposes a Minnesota amendment banning gay marriage, stating that the company values &quot;inclusion&quot;. The company received positive feedback for its stand which might attract people to its global workforce.

The company announced in September 2014 that it would acquire organic food producer Annie&#x27;s Inc. for a fee of around $820 million, as part of its strategy to expand in the US natural foods market. In October 2014, General Mills announced plans to cut 700 to 800 jobs, mostly in U.S., in corporate restructuring planned to be completed by the end of 2015.
In 2015, citing climate change, General Mills promised to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 28 percent over 10 years. In December 2016, the company announced it would be restructuring, splitting into four business groups based on global region, and cutting as many as 600 jobs.

In February 2018, the company entered into the pet products industry, paying $8 billion to buy Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. As of 2018, the company ranked 182nd on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue.

Having launched its first regenerative agriculture pilot program in March 2019, the company has plans to improve soil health on 1 million acres of farmland by 2030 and has formed a partnership with Regrow Agriculture, a software and data analysis company that uses satellite imagery, weather data, and soil data to measure carbon sequestration in soil.

In February 2020, General Mills was recognized by CDP as a global leader in corporate sustainability and received a place on the CDP &quot;A List&quot; for both climate change and water security.

On May 15, 2021, General Mills announced that it was acquiring Tyson Foods&#x27;s pet treat business, including True Chews, Nudges and Top Chews, for $1.2 billion. The acquisition was completed on July 7, 2021.

In April 2022, there were increasing news reports and complaints that the company&#x27;s Lucky Charms cereal was somehow making individuals ill, with the most common complaints being gastrointestinal in nature, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The episodes have not yet resulted in a company- or FDA-initiated recall; an FDA spokesperson said they were investigating approximately 100 reports. These reports came as norovirus was circulating in some areas of the U.S. It is relatively rare for cereals, as opposed to other foods, to be contaminated by microbes, because they must be baked, although it is possible if conditions are unsanitary.

On May 12, 2022, General Mills announced that it was acquiring TNT Crust, a supplier of frozen pizza crusts, from Peak Rock Capital.

On May 25, 2022, General Mills announced that it was selling its Hamburger Helper and Suddenly Salad businesses to Eagle Family Foods Group for $610 million. The sale was completed on July 5, 2022.

On November 9, 2023, General Mills acquired a pet supplement business, Fera Pets, Inc.

On September 12, 2024, General Mills announced that it would sell its North American yogurt division to Groupe Lactalis and Sodiaal. Lacatlis would buy the US brands while Sodiaal would by the Canadian brands which would be completed by 2025.

==Controversies==

=== Association with &quot;anti-diet&quot; movement ===
The company has been associated with social media campaigns and education of dieticians promoting the &quot;anti-diet&quot; movement. This activity has been connected with helping to promote some of its own foods, which are high in sugar content. 

=== Change to legal terms ===
In April 2014, the company announced that it had changed its legal terms on its website to introduce an arbitration clause requiring all disputes with General Mills to be resolved in small claims court or arbitration and not as a participant in a class action. The change was made shortly after a judge&#x27;s March 26, 2014, denial of a motion to dismiss a class action regarding the marketing of the company&#x27;s Nature Valley brand products. Users would be deemed to accept the terms by interacting with General Mills on its website in various ways, such as downloading coupons, subscribing to newsletters, or participating in Internet forums hosted on the website. &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that the agreement could be interpreted to additionally construe purchasing General Mills products at a grocery store or liking the company&#x27;s Facebook page as assent to the terms; General Mills disclaimed that interpretation, calling it a &quot;mischaracterization&quot;. The change in terms resulted in a massive backlash of protests via consumer groups and social media, and General Mills reverted the terms back to the original content after only a few days.

===Involvement in Israeli settlements===
On 12 February 2020, the United Nations published a database of companies doing business related in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as in the occupied Golan Heights. General Mills was listed on the database on account of the activities of its subsidiary General Mills Israel in Israeli settlements in these occupied territories, which some have argued is illegal under international law.
