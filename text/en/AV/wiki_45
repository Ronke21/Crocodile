<text>The Pentland Firth (, meaning the Orcadian Strait) is a strait which separates the Orkney Islands from Caithness in the north of Scotland. Despite the name, it is not a firth.

==Etymology==
The name is presumed to be a corruption of the Old Norse &quot;Petlandsfjörð&quot;, meaning &quot;the fjord of Pictland&quot;, and is completely unrelated to the Pentland Hills near Edinburgh.

Prior to the Norse occupation of Orkney the strait was known as the &quot;Sea of Orcs&quot; – a reference to the Pictish tribe who inhabited Orkney. Such was their marine prowess that there are also instances of this name referring to the sea lanes of the entire west coast of Scotland down to Kintyre. One version of the 9th-century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; states that &quot;the Britons originally filled the whole island with their peoples from the English Channel to the Sea of Orcs&quot;.

==Geography==
On the Caithness (southern) side the Firth extends from Dunnet Head in the west to Duncansby Head in the east, while on the Orkney (northern) side from Tor Ness on Hoy in the west to Old Head on South Ronaldsay in the east.

In the middle of the Firth are two significant islands, Stroma and Swona. The small Pentland Skerries group are in the east. The islands of Hoy and South Ronaldsay border the firth to the north and are part of the Orkney Islands.

The most northerly point of the headland of Dunnet Head, Easter Head, is also that of mainland Britain. The famous John o&#x27; Groats, Mey (site of the Castle of Mey), and many smaller villages are also to be found on the Caithness side as is the town of Thurso and Scrabster Harbour in Thurso Bay, on the western fringe of the Firth.

==Crossing the Firth==
In the West the ferry from Scrabster to Stromness operated by NorthLink is the oldest continuous ferry service across the firth by the ferry MV &quot;Hamnavoe&quot;, started in 1856 as a continuation of the railhead at Thurso. The Far North Line opened 28 July 1874

Historically the Gills Bay area has been the main setting off point from the mainland to the islands of Stroma and Swona and Orkney itself. At present Pentland Ferries operate on this route from Gills Bay to St Margaret&#x27;s Hope on South Ronaldsay.

At the eastern end John o&#x27; Groats Ferries sail to Burwick, also on South Ronaldsay. This is a small passenger ferry which ran in the summer months only until recently. It did not run in the 2024 season.

Consideration was also given to construction of a tunnel linking the islands to the mainland. The tunnel was initially projected to have cost £100 million based on preliminary studies carried out in 2005 but as of 2012 no further progress has been made.

The first recorded swim across the Pentland Firth was by Coleen Blair in 2011. It has since been swum by others including Andrea Gellan (2011; fastest swim) Mark Cameron (2018) and Alison Lievesley (2020)

==Tidal races==
The Firth is well known for the strength of its tidal currents, which are among the fastest in the world, a speed of being reported close west of Pentland Skerries. The force of the tides gives rise to overfalls and tidal races which can occur at different stages of the tide. Combined with gale-force winds, they often give rise to extremely violent sea conditions, which have caused accidents such as the 2015 sinking of the cargo ship MV Cemfjord that resulted in the death of eight crew members.

Some of the principal tidal races are:
*‘The Merry Men of Mey’. Forms off St John&#x27;s point in the west-going stream and extends as the tide increases NNW across the firth to Tor Ness. The worst part is over a sand wave field about west of Stroma. The waves formed by this race form a natural breakwater with relatively calm water to the east of it, particularly noticeable when a westerly swell is running. Tides in this area can exceed .
*‘The Swelkie’. The race at the north end of Stroma, off Swelkie Point is known as &quot;The Swelkie&quot;. It extends from the point in an easterly or westerly direction depending on the tide and can be particularly violent. The whirlpool, according to a Nordic tradition recorded in the Eddas, is caused by two gýgjar named Fenja and Menja turning the millstone Grótti, which grinds out the ocean&#x27;s salt. The witches &#x27;Grotti Finnie&#x27; and &#x27;Grotti Minnie&#x27; feature in later Orcadian and Shetlandic folklore. The name of the race is derived from , meaning &quot;the Swallower&quot;.
*The ‘Duncansby Race’ forms off Ness of Duncansby at the start of the SE-going tidal stream (flood). Initially extending ENE but wheeling gradually anti-clockwise until it extends about NW some  h later at which point it is known as ‘The Boars of Duncansby’. During the time of the SE stream there is additional turbulence off Duncansby Head, particularly to the East. The race temporarily ceases at the turn of the tide before forming in an ENE direction in the NW-going tidal stream (ebb) before ceasing again at the next turn of the tide. The race is particularly violent and dangerous when the tidal stream is opposed by gales in the opposite direction. During the east-going stream a race forms off Ness of Huna. This race can be particularly violent in an easterly or southeasterly gale.
*The ‘Liddel Eddy’ forms between South Ronaldsay and Muckle Skerry in the East-going stream (flood). A race also forms for part of the time off Old Head at the SE part of South Ronaldsay.

In addition to ‘The Swelkie’, races form at both the north and south ends of Stroma and Swona. Between the races there is a calm eddy which extends down tide as the tide strengthens. The races are highly visible with overfalls and whirlpools. Large swell waves can also be present, especially in bad weather conditions. When entering or leaving the eddies, crossing the races, even large powerful vessels can be pushed off course, such is the demarcation between the relatively calm eddy and the fast-moving tide in the races. There are other races in the firth particularly off Brough Head.

==Tidal power==
Currents of up to make the Pentland Firth potentially one of the best sites in the world for tidal power. This has taken on a political dimension. The SNP Energy Review of July 2006 claimed that the Firth could produce &quot;10 to 20 GW of synchronous electricity&quot; and First Minister Alex Salmond claimed that the Pentland Firth could be &quot;the Saudi Arabia of tidal power&quot; with an output of &quot;20 gigawatts and more than that&quot;. In July 2013 Thomas Adcock of Oxford University stated that the Firth &quot;is almost certainly the best site for tidal stream power in the world&quot; although a peer-reviewed study he led suggested that the maximum potential of the Firth was 1.9 GW of tidal power, with one GW being a more realistic figure.

In October 2008 tidal power developer Atlantis Resources Corporation (ARC) announced it was considering a site near the Castle of Mey for a computer data centre that would be powered by a tidal scheme in the Firth. In October 2010 MeyGen, a consortium of ARC, Morgan Stanley and International Power, received operational lease from the Crown Estate to a 400 MW project for 25 years. Consent was granted in September 2013 for MeyGen to build a 9 MW demonstration project of six AR1000 turbines commissioning in 2015 with 86 MW planned for phase 1 by 2020. The second phase would install up to 400 turbines generating 398 MW.

MeyGen completed the longest-ever run of continuous tidal electricity generation in 2019 with 25 GWh produced, enough to power nearly 4,000 homes.

==Marine wildlife==
Seals can be seen at all times of the year in all parts of the firth. They usually bask on the rocks on the ebb (falling) tide since it saves them having to move as the water rises. Large groups of seals can be seen at the north of Stroma, from the lighthouse round to the north-west part of the island and at the south end in the area of the beacon and to the east between the old jetty and the lighthouse. On Swona they can be seen around the midpoint of the west coast.
The common seal come in various colours with spots and have their pups in May, June and July. They are of a similar colour to the adults and can swim from birth, The grey seal, which is more common in this area having one of the largest British populations, also comes in a number of colours and live in colonies giving birth to white pups from October through to January. These pups do not swim at first until they shed their white coat. When giving birth seals can often be seen inland.

Porpoises can be seen all year round in all parts of the firth although they tend to favour shallower water. They grow to about 1.5 m and are black with a broad based triangular fin which can be seen as they surface. They have a small, rotund body with a short, blunt head, no beak, and a small, triangular dorsal fin. They are usually seen singly or in small numbers although in the autumn many groups may be seen in Gills Bay. When in groups, they tend to swim in a more random fashion than dolphins who swim together.

Dolphins are not very common but seen from time to time. Many different types visit the firth and may be seen anywhere at any time. Larger than porpoises, 2–3 m depending on the type, black, with the rear edge of the fin curved back at the top unlike the straight edge of the porpoise. Head has a distinct beak. Often swim alongside the bow of vessels and frolic in the bow waves. Probably more than one usually swimming together in a more synchronised manner, sometimes leaping out of the water.

Killer whales are mostly seen around May to July although may be sighted at any time of the year. Usually swim in a pod of a maximum of from six to twelve individuals led by a matriarchal female. Males can grow up to 9 m long and can be about 25% larger than females and juveniles in the pod. They tend to be fairly distinctive due to their size, fin and markings. The male has a very tall, triangular and erect dorsal fin which is sometimes tilted forwards. Juveniles and adult females both have a smaller, sickle-shaped dorsal fin. When surfacing the grey saddle shows up over the black back, behind the dorsal fin. It has a conical-shaped black head, with a distinctive white oval patch above and behind the eye, an indistinct beak, white throat and large paddle-shaped flippers.

Minke whales are quite often seen in June and occasionally through to October but also at other times of the year. Tend to feed in the up-welling water of the tidal races but can be seen elsewhere. Usually seen singly but may be in pairs. Grows to 7–8.5 m, black with diagonal white band on flipper and a slender, pointed triangular head. Relatively small dorsal fin curved back at top at rear part of body. Will probably see the long back with small fin to rear breaking the surface although they are known to bow and stern ride the waves of vessels.

Basking shark. Rare but being seen more often around May to August. A fish rather than a marine mammal, it spends most of its time cruising on the surface filter feeding. The dorsal fin can be seen moving steadily through the water with the tip of the tail moving from side to side behind it. Usually seen feeding inshore at high tide around here in the Gills Bay, Stroma, area though may be seen in deeper water. Generally around 8 m long, greyish brown to bluish black with pale belly. Seen in northern waters in the summer, southern in winter. Often in groups of three or four.

Turtles. Very rarely seen, however, they are occasionally found caught in fishing nets in this area. The leatherback is the most frequently recorded species in UK waters and probably the only one in this area. Grows to about 2.9 m with an elongated black shell spotted with white, which tapers to a blunt spike. Migrates to UK waters from the tropics in the summer to feed on jellyfish. There are four other species less frequently encountered in UK waters where they usually occur as stray juveniles carried by currents from warmer seas.

<doc id="161314" wikidata="Q206988" url="?curid=161314" title="Cheltenham">
<text>Cheltenham () is a spa town and borough on the edge of the Cotswolds in Gloucestershire, England. Cheltenham became known as a health and holiday spa town resort following the discovery of mineral springs in 1716, and claims to be the most complete Regency town in Britain. It is directly northeast of Gloucester.

The town hosts several cultural festivals, often featuring nationally and internationally famous contributors and attendees: the Cheltenham Literature Festival, the Cheltenham Jazz Festival, the Cheltenham Science Festival, the Cheltenham Music Festival, the Cheltenham International Film Festival, the Cheltenham Cricket Festival and the Cheltenham Food &amp; Drink Festival. In steeplechase horse racing, the Gold Cup is the main event of the Cheltenham Festival held every March.

==History==

Cheltenham is located at River Chelt, which rises nearby at Dowdeswell and runs through the town on its way to the Severn. It was first recorded in 803, as &quot;Celtan hom&quot;; the meaning has not been resolved with certainty, but latest scholarship concludes that the first element preserves a Celtic noun &quot;cilta&quot;, &#x27;steep hill&#x27;, here referring to the Cotswold scarp; the second element may mean &#x27;settlement&#x27; or &#x27;water-meadow&#x27;. As a royal manor, it features in the earliest pages of the Gloucestershire section of Domesday Book where it is named &quot;Chintenha[m]&quot;. The town was awarded a market charter in 1226.

Though little remains of its pre-spa history, Cheltenham has always been a health and holiday spa town resort since the discovery of mineral springs there in 1716. Captain Henry Skillicorne (1678–1763), is credited with being the first entrepreneur to recognise the opportunity to exploit the mineral springs. The retired &quot;master mariner&quot; became co-owner of the property containing Cheltenham&#x27;s first mineral spring upon his 1732 marriage to Elizabeth Mason. Her father, William Mason, had done little in his lifetime to promote the healing properties of the mineral water apart from limited advertising and building a small enclosure over the spring. Skillicorne&#x27;s wide travels as a merchant had prepared him to see the dormant potential on this inherited property. After moving to Cheltenham in 1738, he immediately began improvements intended to attract visitors to his spa. He built a pump to regulate water flow and erected an elaborate well-house complete with a ballroom and upstairs billiard room to entertain his customers. The beginnings of Cheltenham&#x27;s tree-lined promenades and the gardens surrounding its spas were first designed by Captain Skillicorne with the help of &quot;wealthy and traveled&quot; friends who understood the value of relaxing avenues. The area&#x27;s walks and gardens had views of the countryside, and soon the gentry and nobility from across the county were enticed to come and investigate the beneficial waters of Cheltenham&#x27;s market town spa.

In 1795, Captain Powell Snell raised the First Troop of Gloucestershire Gentleman and Yeomanry (Royal Gloucestershire Hussars) at the Plough Inn (now Regent Arcade) in Cheltenham. 
The visit of George III with the queen and royal princesses in 1788 set a stamp of fashion on the spa. The spa waters can still be sampled at the Pittville Pump Room, built for this purpose and completed in 1830; it is a centrepiece of Pittville, a planned extension of Cheltenham to the north, undertaken by Joseph Pitt, who laid the first stone 4 May 1825.

Cheltenham&#x27;s success as a spa town is reflected in the railway station, still called Cheltenham Spa, and spa facilities in other towns inspired by or named after it.

Alice Liddell and Lewis Carroll were regular visitors to a house in Cudnall Street, Charlton Kings – a suburb of Cheltenham. Alice Liddell&#x27;s grandparents owned this house, and still contains the mirror, or looking glass, that was purportedly inspired for Lewis Carroll&#x27;s novel &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, published in 1871.

Horse racing began in Cheltenham in 1815 and became a major national attraction after the establishment of the Festival in 1902. The racecourse attracts tens of thousands of visitors to each day of the festival each year, with such large numbers of visitors having a significant impact on the town.

In the Second World War, the United States Army Services of Supply, European Theatre of Operations established its primary headquarters at Cheltenham under the direction of Lt. Gen. John C. H. Lee, with the flats of the Cheltenham Racecourse becoming a giant storage depot for countless trucks, jeeps, tanks and artillery pieces. Most of this material was reshipped to the continent for and after the D-Day invasion. Lee and his primary staff had offices and took residence at Thirlestaine Hall in Cheltenham.

The first British jet aircraft prototype, the Gloster E.28/39, was manufactured in Cheltenham. Manufacturing started in Hucclecote near Gloucester, but was later moved to Regent Motors in Cheltenham High Street (now the Regent Arcade), considered a location safer from bombing during the Second World War.

==Geography==

Cheltenham is on the edge of the Cotswolds, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in the South-West region of England. The small River Chelt flows under and through the town.

Cleeve Hill, overlooks the town and is the highest point in the county of Gloucestershire and the Cotswold Hills range, at .

The town is near the northeastern edge of the South West of England region being west-northwest of London, northeast of Bristol and south of Birmingham.

===Neighbourhoods===

The districts of Cheltenham include: Arle, Benhall, Charlton Kings, Fairview, Fiddler&#x27;s Green, Hesters Way, Lansdown, Leckhampton, Lynworth, Montpellier, Oakley, Pittville, Prestbury, the Reddings, Rowanfield, St Luke&#x27;s, St Mark&#x27;s, St Paul&#x27;s, St Peter&#x27;s, Springbank, Swindon Village, Tivoli, Up Hatherley, Whaddon and Wyman&#x27;s Brook.

The borough contains three civil parishes within its boundaries. These are Charlton Kings, Leckhampton with Warden Hill and Prestbury. These all have their own parish councils who handle local services and planning with elected councillors.

=== Green belt ===

Parts of the town has green belt along its fringes, and this extends into the surrounding Tewkesbury district, helping to maintain local green space, prevent further urban sprawl and unplanned expansion towards Gloucester and Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve, as well as protecting smaller villages in between. West of the Greenfield Way and Fiddlers Green Lane roads, along with much of the open space up to the Civil Service Sports Ground, as well as the Cheltenham Racecourse and surrounding green park, along with St Peter Leckhampton parish church and Brizen Playing Fields/Haven and Greenmead parks along the south of the borough, are covered.

== Potential merger of Cheltenham and Gloucester ==
In May 2024, under plans by Gloucestershire County Council, it was reported that there are secret talks to formally merge the conurbations of Cheltenham and Gloucester with each other. The plans suggest that around ten new garden towns could be built around the green belt at Boddington which if removed would result in the complete merger of both boroughs. Doing so would facilitate and effectively merge the two into a supercity. The move has been criticised by both Cheltenham Borough Council and Gloucester City Council.

==Government==
Cheltenham Borough Council is the local authority for Cheltenham; it is split into 20 wards, with a total of 40 councillors elected to serve on the borough council. Since 2002, elections have been held every two years with half of the councillors elected at each election.

===Administrative history===
Cheltenham was an ancient parish. Until 1786 it was administered by its vestry, in the same way as most rural areas. The vestry was supplemented by a body of unelected improvement commissioners in 1786 known as the Paving and Lighting Commission, initially charged with paving, lighting and repairing the streets, which later gained other powers including providing a watch and setting standards for new buildings. The commissioners were reformed in 1852 to be partly-elected and were eventually replaced in 1876 when the town was incorporated as a municipal borough.

On 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the borough of Cheltenham was merged with Charlton Kings urban district to form the non-metropolitan district of Cheltenham. Four parishes—Swindon Village, Up Hatherley, Leckhampton and Prestbury—were added to the borough of Cheltenham from the borough of Tewkesbury in 1991.

;Architecture
The town is known for its Regency architecture and is said to be &quot;the most complete regency town in England&quot;. Many of the buildings are listed, including the Cheltenham Synagogue, judged by Nikolaus Pevsner to be one of the architecturally best non-Anglican places of worship in Britain.
Built in 1902 within the Imperial Square, Cheltenham Town Hall is a Grade II-listed building and features a plaque commemorating the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra.

;Art
The Cheltenham Art Gallery &amp; Museum, also called The Wilson, hosts a programme of art exhibitions running throughout the year. The Wilson was named after polar explorer Edward Wilson, who was born in Cheltenham.

In 2014, many of the town&#x27;s historic cultural and leisure buildings were put under the control of The Cheltenham Trust, a charity set up to manage and develop the buildings on behalf of the town. Along with The Wilson, the Trust now manages the Town Hall, the Pittville Pump Room, the Prince of Wales Stadium and Leisure @, a large fitness and swimming complex. A volunteer board of Trustees controls the Trust.

The Cheltenham Paint Festival attracts hundreds of mural artists from dozens of countries worldwide and is a highlight of the Gloucestershire arts calendar. In 2014, a piece of graffiti by street artist Banksy appeared next to a telephone box in a residential street in Cheltenham. The graffiti depicted three men in trench coats and dark glasses apparently listening in to calls made in the telephone box. In 2016, it was removed – possibly destroyed – ahead of the sale of the house on which it had been painted.

Cheltenham features several sculptural artworks of note, including:
*Neptune&#x27;s Fountain in the Promenade, built in 1893 and designed by Joseph Hall
*The Hare and the Minotaur, also in the Promenade, created in 1995 by Sophie Ryder

===Cheltenham Festival===

Cheltenham Festival is a significant National Hunt racing meeting, and has race prize money second only to the Grand National. It is an event where many of the best British and Irish trained horses race against each other, the extent of which is relatively rare during the rest of the season.

The festival takes place annually in March at Cheltenham Racecourse. The meeting is often very popular with Irish visitors, mostly because of that nation&#x27;s affinity with horse racing, but also because it usually coincides with St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, a national holiday in celebration of the patron saint of Ireland.

Large amounts of money are bet during festival week, with hundreds of millions of pounds being gambled over the four days. Cheltenham is often noted for its atmosphere, most notably the &quot;Cheltenham roar&quot;, which refers to the enormous amount of noise that the crowd generates as the starter raises the tape for the first race of the festival.

==Transport==
===Railways===

Cheltenham Spa railway station is a stop on the Bristol-Birmingham main line. It is located to the west of the Montpellier area of the town and is known locally as &quot;Lansdown&quot;.

The station is served by three train operating companies:
* CrossCountry operates long-distance services between the South West, South Wales, the Midlands, the North West, the North East and Scotland.
* Great Western Railway connects the town with , , , and London Paddington. 
* Transport for Wales operates services between Cheltenham Spa and South Wales, usually running through to Maesteg via Gloucester, Chepstow, Newport, Cardiff Central and Bridgend.

The &quot;Cheltenham Spa Express&quot;, once known as the &quot;Cheltenham Flyer&quot;, is a named passenger train connecting Cheltenham with London. The former Cheltenham Flyer was, for a time, the fastest passenger train in scheduled service in the world. 

At its peak, the town had eight railway stations, only one of which survives. It is a matter of local controversy that trains are not run directly to London but instead via Gloucester; although routes do exist for a direct and therefore much faster service, as demonstrated during 2023 when a bridge closure in Oxfordshire led to some services to Hereford stopping at Cheltenham.
The restored Cheltenham Racecourse railway station is the southern terminus of the heritage Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway. The Honeybourne Line was extended northwards to Broadway in 2018, with an aspiration to extend the line southwards to Cheltenham Spa where the line originally branched off from the Bristol to Birmingham main line.

===Roads===
Cheltenham is adjacent to the M5 motorway, between Bristol and Birmingham. Junction 10 serves the north of the town, via the A4019; junction 11 links to the south, via the A40 which continues towards Oxford and London.

===Buses and coaches===
Stagecoach West operate the majority of bus services in Cheltenham, including routes to Gloucester and Tewkesbury.

National Express operates a number of coach services from Cheltenham including route 444 to London and Heathrow Airport. Before becoming part of National Express, Cheltenham was a major hub for &quot;Black and White Coaches&quot;, with routes throughout the country, many of which formed a mass exodus through the town at 14:30 each day.

===Tramroad===
Cheltenham was a terminus of the Gloucester and Cheltenham Tramroad.

==Churches==
The first parish church is Cheltenham Minster, St Mary&#x27;s, which is the only surviving medieval building in the town. As a result of expansion of the population, absorption of surrounding villages, and the efforts of both evangelical and Anglo-Catholic missions, the town has a large number of other parish churches, including Trinity Church and All Saints&#x27;, Pittville, where the composer Gustav Holst&#x27;s father was the organist.

St Gregory&#x27;s Roman Catholic church is an example of the work of the architect Charles Hansom. The Gothic Revival building was built 1854–57, the porch was added in 1859, the tower and spire were completed in 1861 and the nave was extended to join the tower in 1877. The church&#x27;s stained glass is by Hardman &amp; Co.

===Bell ringing===
The town has three rings of bells hung for change ringing. One is located in St Mark&#x27;s Church – a ring of 8 bells, with the heaviest being some 16cwt. These were originally a ring of 5 bells cast at John Taylor of Loughborough in 1885, extensively overhauled and augmented in 8 in 2007. Another is at St. Christopher&#x27;s (Warden Hill), the lightest ring of church bells in the world. The other is a ring of 12 bells hung in St. Mary&#x27;s Church (the Minster). These were the venue in 2008 for the eliminators of the National 12 Bell Striking contest, in which teams of campanologists from around the world compete to win the Taylor Trophy. In 2017 the old ring of 12 was completely replaced with new bells cast by John Taylor &amp; Co. The tenor bell is just over a ton in weight, and the new ring also includes a thirteenth bell, a sharp 2nd, to provide a lighter 8. The towers in the locality of Cheltenham belong to the Cheltenham branch of the Gloucester &amp; Bristol Diocesan Association of Church Bell Ringers.

==Twin towns==
Cheltenham is twinned with:
* Annecy, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, France
* Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, United States
* Göttingen, Lower Saxony, Germany
* Weihai, Shandong, China

Twinning with Sochi, Russia was suspended in response to 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

<doc id="161319" wikidata="Q2742872" url="?curid=161319" title="Baal teshuva">
<text>In Judaism, a ba&#x27;al teshuvah (; for a woman, , or ; plural, , , &#x27;owner of return [to God or his way]&#x27;) is a Jew who adopts some form of traditional religious observance after having previously followed a secular lifestyle or a less frum form of Judaism.

The baal teshuva movement is a description of the return of secular Jews to religious Judaism. The term is used to refer to a worldwide phenomenon among the Jewish people.

==Definition==
The phrase &quot;baal teshuva&quot; generally refers to a Jew from a non-Orthodox background who becomes religiously observant in an Orthodox fashion; however, the concept can also encompass Orthodox-leaning Jews who become stricter in their observance.

The term &quot;baal teshuva&quot; is from the Talmud and means &quot;master of repentance&quot;. In Israel, (; plural: ), meaning &quot;returning to return&quot; or &quot;returning to repentance&quot; is more commonly used. Hence, a &quot;baal teshuva&quot; is a Jew who transgressed the &quot;halakhah&quot; (Jewish law) knowingly or unknowingly, but has completed a process of introspection to &quot;return&quot; to the full observance of God&#x27;s &quot;mitzvot&quot;.

==Interpretation==
According to Maimonides&#x27;s &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; a &quot;ba&#x27;al teshuvah&quot; stands higher in &quot;shamayim&quot; (lit. &#x27;heaven&#x27;) than a &quot;frum from birth&quot;, even higher than a tzadik.

According to the teachings of the Torah, &quot;whoever judges himself will not be judged&quot;; however, in the described history of Talmudic times and early Hasidism, many tzadikim were able to &quot;see&quot; the transgressions of others.

==History==
===In the United States===
The &quot;baal teshuva&quot; movement began to appear as an identifiable movement in the United States in the 1960s, as a growing number of young Jews raised in non-religious homes in the United States started to develop a strong interest in becoming a part of observant Judaism; many of these people, in contrast to sociological expectations, became attracted to observant Judaism within Orthodoxy.

The Baal teshuva movement was also inspired by the sixties and seventies counterculture, especially the counterculture of the 1960s and the Hippie movement (Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach tried to channel the counterculture and its music into a Jewish direction through his music and teachings), the Woodstock Festival, the drug subculture, the new interest in Eastern religions (Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan tried to channel that interest into a Jewish direction through his writings) and the spirit of youth rebellion that pervaded US high schools and college campuses. It was in recognition of this phenomenon and in response to it that the earliest emissaries of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, went out to connect with these people and &quot;recruit&quot; them to Judaism.

According to Rabbi Yosef Blau the mashgiach ruchani of Yeshiva University:

Whereas early Baal teshuva trends were partly related to the prevailing anti-establishment atmosphere of the 1960s, an increase in Jewish pride in the wake of Israel&#x27;s victory in 1967&#x27;s Six-Day War fueled and gave momentum to the beginnings of the &quot;baal teshuva&quot; movement.&quot;

Although the effects of the Holocaust and the sway of the counterculture movement led many to abandon their religious upbringing, others were willing to experiment with alternate liberated lifestyles, and as part of this experimentation it was intriguing to them to explore Jewish Sabbath observance, intensive prayer, and deeper Torah and Talmud study. Many of these people adopted a fully Orthodox Jewish way of life, and although some eventually dropped out entirely or found their path within Conservative Judaism or other streams of Judaism, or even joined other faiths, others chose to remain with Orthodoxy:

In 1986, &quot;New York magazine&quot; reported:
===In the former Soviet Union===

The baal teshuva movement also appeared in the former Soviet Union, which at that time had almost completely secularized its Jewish population. The rise of Jewish pride came in response to the growth of the State of Israel, in reaction to the USSR&#x27;s pro-Arab and anti-Zionist policies, and in reaction to USSR&#x27;s antisemitism.

The Israeli victory in the Six-Day War in 1967 ignited the pride of Jews in the Soviet Union, particularly in Russia. Suddenly there were hundreds of thousands of Jews wanting to go to Israel, although they dared not express their desire too openly. Several thousand applied for exit visas to Israel and were instantly ostracized by government organizations including the KGB. Many hundreds became refuseniks (&quot;otkazniks&quot; in Russian), willing to suffer jail time to demonstrate their new-found longing for Zion. In the middle of this, there arose a new interest in learning about and practicing Judaism, an urge that the Communist government had long attempted to stamp out.

Many Russian Jews began to study any Jewish texts they could lay their hands on. Foreign rabbis, often young students in Chabad Yeshivot, came on visits in order to teach how to learn Torah and how to observe Jewish law. Jewish ritual objects, such as tefillin, mezuzot, siddurim, and even matzah, were also smuggled into Russia. With the fall of the Communist regime, there is now a rich resource of Russian religious texts that flourishes and caters to Russian Jews living in Russia, America, and Israel.

The return-to-Judaism movement was a spontaneous grassroots movement from the ground up and was part of the refusenik movement; it came as a great surprise to the Soviet authorities, and even to the Jewish community outside the USSR and it eventually contributed to Aliyah from the Soviet Union and post-Soviet states and the collapse of the Soviet Union and emigration to Israel. Young leaders included Yosef Mendelevich, Eliyahu Essas (who eventually became a rabbi), Herman Branover, and Yitzchok Kogan, who all later moved to Israel and are now actively teaching other Russian emigres in Israel, aside from Kogan, who leads a community in Moscow.

===In Israel===

During the 1960s there was a movement among secular Israeli Jews that was essentially a search for spirituality. At the time, most Israeli parents were secular Zionists. While some Jews were hostile to traditional Judaism, a spiritual quest in the 1960s and 1970s caused some Israelis to seek answers in Jewish tradition.

Rabbi Aharon Feldman observes that:
In Israel, special schools developed for the newly-religious, who came to be called &quot;Baalei teshuva&quot; (m. plural), &quot;Baal teshuva&quot; (m. singular), a &quot;Baalat teshuva&quot; refers to a female, and &quot;chozeret biteshuva&quot; in Hebrew. Schools were established dedicated to the intensive study of Torah specially designed for the newly religious students who wanted to devote time to intensive study of classical texts with the ancient rabbinic commentaries. These schools opened in the early 1970s, mainly based in Jerusalem. Two significant institutions have been the Aish HaTorah (&quot;fire of Torah&quot;) Yeshiva headed by Rabbi Noach Weinberg, and the Ohr Somayach Yeshiva headed by Rabbis Nota Schiller and Mendel Weinbach. Both of these rabbis had degrees from American universities and were able to speak to the modern mind-set. See also Diaspora Yeshiva, Machon Meir.

Chabad Hasidism, with many Chabad houses throughout Israel, and yeshiva programs for Israelis, Russians, French, and Americans, reach out to thousands. Followers of Chabad can be seen attending tefillin booths at the Western Wall and Ben Gurion International Airport as well as other public places, and distributing Shabbat candles on Fridays. There are also Chabad houses in almost every location that Jews might be located, whether as permanent residents, on business, or tourists.

Among Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews, Rabbi Amnon Yitzhak and Rabbi Reuven Elbaz are considered the leaders of the baal teshuva movement in Israel.

==Challenges, critiques and difficulties==

As with all social movements, there is controversy and criticism. Early twenty-first century researchers have debated the &quot;drop-out&quot; rate from this movement and the reasons for it and new challenges that are now presented. From a 2005 paper:

<text>Brooklands was a motor racing circuit and aerodrome built near Weybridge in Surrey, England, United Kingdom. It opened in 1907 and was the world&#x27;s first purpose-built &#x27;banked&#x27; motor racing circuit as well as one of Britain&#x27;s first airfields, which also became Britain&#x27;s largest aircraft manufacturing centre by 1918, producing military aircraft such as the Wellington and civil airliners like the Viscount and VC-10.

The circuit hosted its last race in August 1939 and today part of it forms the Brooklands Museum, a major aviation and motoring museum, as well as a venue for vintage car, motorcycle and other transport-related events.

==History==

===Brooklands motor circuit===
The Brooklands motor circuit was the brainchild of Hugh Fortescue Locke-King, and was the first purpose-built banked motor race circuit in the world. Following the Motor Car Act 1903, Britain was subject to a blanket speed limit on public roads: at a time when nearly 50% of the world&#x27;s new cars were produced in France, there was concern that Britain&#x27;s infant auto-industry would be hampered by the inability to undertake sustained high-speed testing. King commissioned Colonel Capel Lofft Holden of the Royal Artillery to design the projected circuit and work began in 1906.

Requirements of speed and spectator visibility led to the Brooklands track being built as a wide, long, banked oval. The banking was nearly high in places. In addition to the oval, a bisecting &quot;Finishing Straight&quot; was built, increasing the track length to , of which was banked. It could host up to 287,000 spectators in its heyday.

Owing to the complications of laying tarmacadam on banking, and the expense of laying asphalt, the track was built in uncoated concrete. This led in later years to a somewhat bumpy ride, as the surface suffered differential settlement over time.

Along the centre of the track ran a dotted black line, known as the &quot;Fifty Foot Line&quot;. By driving over the line, a driver could theoretically take the banked corners without having to use the steering wheel.

The track was opened on 17 June 1907 with a luncheon attended by most of Britain&#x27;s motor manufacturers. At the conclusion of the luncheon, Mr Locke King (on whose estate the track was built) named Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, Messrs. Hugh Owen, Julian Walter Orde (secretary of the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland) and Colonel Holden as being the main people that enabled the track to be built. This was followed by an informal inauguration of the track by a procession of 43 cars, one driven by Charles Rolls. The first competitive event was held on 28–29 June, with three cars competing to break the world record for distance covered in 24 hours, and the first race meeting was held on 6 July, attracting over 10,000 spectators.

Apparently drawing inspiration from the development at Brooklands, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was built soon afterwards, and held its inaugural race in August 1909.

===The Mountain Circuit===
The Brooklands Mountain Circuit was a small section of the track giving a lap long, running from the Fork to the rear of Members&#x27; Hill and back. It was created in 1930 using movable barriers.

===Motoring records===

====24-hour event====
On 28–29 June 1907, eleven days after the circuit opened, it played host to the world&#x27;s first 24-hour motor event, with Selwyn Edge leading three specially converted Napier cars around the circuit. A statement of intent had been made in 1906, and Selwyn Edge entered into a physical training program to prepare for the event. His car, &quot;804&quot; was extensively modified, having a special fuel tank, bodywork removed, and a special windscreen. Over 300 red railway lamps were used to light the track during the night. Flares were used to mark the upper boundary of the track. Edge drove his car for the full duration, with the drivers of the other two cars (Henry C. Tryon/A. F. Browning and F. Draper/Frank Newton) taking the more familiar shift approach. During the event Edge covered a distance of at an average speed of , comfortably beating the existing record of set at Indianapolis in 1905.

Women were not allowed to compete for several years. Dorothy Levitt, S. F. Edge&#x27;s leading driver, was refused entry despite having been the &#x27;first English-woman to compete in a motor race&#x27; in 1903, and holding the &#x27;Ladies World Land Speed Record&#x27;. Edge completed 2,545 km at an average 106.06 km/h, a record which stood for 17 years. The first standard race meeting would be held the next week, on 6 July.

====One-hour records====
George E. Stanley broke the one-hour record at Brooklands race track on a Singer motorcycle in 1912, becoming the first ever rider of a 350 cc motorcycle to cover over in an hour.

The world record for the first person to cover 100 miles in 1 hour was set by Percy E. Lambert at Brooklands, on 15 February 1913 when driving his 4.5 litre sidevalve Talbot. He actually covered 103 miles, 1470 yards (167.1 km) in 60 minutes. A contemporary film of his exploits on that day can be viewed at the Brooklands Museum.

Youngest person to drive a lap at Brooklands

Ivy Cummings is thought to be the youngest person to complete a lap when in 1913, (aged 11/12) she started her father Sydney Cummings&#x27; car whilst he was watching aircraft and drove around the course.

====Distance records====
In July and August 1929, Violette Cordery and her younger sister Evelyn drove her 4.5 litre four-seater Invicta for 30,000 miles in less than 30,000 minutes (approximately 20 days, 20 hours), averaging 61.57 mph and earning her second Dewar Trophy from the Royal Automobile Club.

===World War One===
Brooklands closed to motor racing during World War I, was requisitioned by the War Office and continued its pre-war role as a flying training centre although it was now under military control. Brooklands soon became a major location for the construction, testing and supply of military aeroplanes.

=== Inter-war years ===
Motor racing resumed in 1920 after extensive track repairs and Grand Prix motor racing was established at Brooklands in 1926 by Henry Segrave, after his victories in the 1923 French Grand Prix and the San Sebastián Grand Prix (all won on Sunbeam Racing Cars which in various hands had significant success in Brooklands) the following year raised interest in the sport in Britain. This first British Grand Prix was won by Louis Wagner and Robert Sénéchal, sharing the drive in a Delage 155B. The second British Grand Prix was staged there in 1927 and these two events resulted in improved facilities at Brooklands.

In 1930, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; offered a trophy for the fastest driver at an event at Brooklands. The first year, Birkin and Kaye Don competed, the former in a Bentley Blower tourer, the latter in the Sunbeam &#x27;Tigress&#x27; 4 litre, Don winning with a speed of . In 1932, Birkin won driving his red &quot;Monoposto&quot; Bentley Blower No.1, clocking . The track record stood for two years, before being beaten by John Cobb driving the 24 litre Napier-Railton, which holds the all-time lap record at .

In 1932 the Junior Car Club organised the British 1000 Miles Race, which was held in two parts on 3 and 4 June. The race was won by Mrs E. Wisdom and Miss Joan Richmond driving a Riley Brooklands 9.

During the late 1930s, Brooklands also hosted massed start cycle racing events organised by the National Cyclists&#x27; Union (as the sport&#x27;s governing body, the NCU banned such events from public roads). In 1939, it was used as a location for the Will Hay film, &quot;Ask a Policeman&quot;.
An episode in Johannes V. Jensen&#x27;s novelle &quot;Gudrun&quot; from 1936 takes place at the race track.

Racing stopped when World War II started in 1939. The site was turned over to war-time production of military aircraft. Enemy bombs damaged the track and a new access road to the Hawker factory was cut through from Oyster Lane. Temporary dispersal hangars covered other sections.

==Brooklands Aerodrome==

=== 1909–1914 ===

Brooklands was also one of Britain&#x27;s first airfields. In 1908 Alliott Verdon-Roe was based at Brooklands and carried out the first taxiing and towed flight trials of a British full-size powered aircraft by a British pilot. On Friday, 29 October 1909 the first official powered flight at Brooklands was made by Frenchman Louis Paulhan and his Farman biplane: this special event attracted 20,000 people and was the first public flying display at Brooklands. Operating from specially prepared land inside the Race Track and given his own aeroplane shed, Paulhan made a series of flights on the following days, flying to a height of some on the Saturday and setting a new British endurance record of 2 hr 49 min 20 s on the Monday.

During 1910 Brooklands rapidly became a major centre of flying in Britain and that summer, Hilda Hewlett and Gustave Blondeau opened Britain&#x27;s first flying school at Brooklands. Hewlett and Blondeau also started their aircraft manufacturing company, Hewlett &amp; Blondeau Limited there before moving to larger premises in Clapham in London. Later in 1910 the Bristol Aeroplane Company also established a flying school, its first instructor and test pilot was Archie Low; Roe also started a flying school there.
Vickers opened a flying school on 20 January 1912, and among its first instructors was R. Harold Barnwell; 77 pupils including Hugh Dowding were taught to fly until the school closed in August 1914.

In February 1912 Thomas Sopwith opened his flying school and in June, with several others, he set up the Sopwith Aviation Company there, although their manufacturing premises were at Kingston upon Thames. Other aviation pioneers came to Brooklands before World War One including Prince Serge de Bolotoff who tried to build a large tandem triplane in a shed there in 1913. Blériot, Martinsyde and Vickers also later produced military aeroplanes at Brooklands which became Britain&#x27;s largest aircraft manufacturing centre by 1918. Many flying schools operated here before 1914 and the aerodrome became a major flying training centre between the wars.

=== World War One ===
During World War I Brooklands closed to motor racing and was requisitioned by the War Office. Vickers Aviation Ltd set up a factory in 1915, and Brooklands soon became a major centre for the construction, testing and supply of military aeroplanes. Civilian flying schools closed down or were merged into one Military Training School and flying training continued until at least the end of 1915. Several Royal Flying Corps squadrons including numbers 1, 8, 9 and 10 (plus No. 2 and 23 Reserve Squadrons) were formed (or reformed) and based briefly at Brooklands during the war years. Continuing significant pioneering air-ground wireless trials pioneered by a Marconi team at Brooklands from 1912, the aerodrome also housed various RFC units testing and training with airborne wireless communications equipment and the World&#x27;s first voice to ground wireless message was successfully transmitted over Brooklands in 1915.

Major changes were made to the Flying Village with the construction in late 1917 of three large &#x27;Belfast-truss&#x27; General Service Sheds for a new Aircraft Acceptance Park (later No. 10 AAP). This handled the assembly and testing of large numbers of new aeroplanes and finally closed in early 1920.

=== Inter-war years ===
Brooklands Aviation Ltd was formed in 1931 - with Percy Bradley, Duncan Davis, Fred Sigrist and Ted Jones as Directors - to operate the aerodrome, and commissioned British airport architect Graham Dawbarn to design the Art Deco Brooklands Aero Clubhouse, which opened in May 1932. The company also operated the resident Brooklands School of Flying which was registered as a limited company in 1931 with Duncan Davis and Ted Jones as Directors, as well as those at Lympne, Shoreham and Sywell Aerodromes in the later 1930s. The original pre-WW1 Brooklands Aero Club was re-formed by the BARC in May 1930 with Percy Bradley as Manager and the Brooklands Flying Club was established by Brooklands Aviation in early 1933. Brooklands Aviation won a War Department contract for pilot training for the Royal Air Force. and opened No. 6 Elementary Flying Training School at Sywell on 10 June 1935, training pilots with a fleet of 20 de Havilland Tiger Moths, and in 1937 the RAF Volunteer Reserve School was set up at Sywell with a further 16 training aircraft. During WW2, Brooklands Aviation became a contractor to the Civilian Repair Organisation, repairing various types of damaged aircraft, particularly Vickers Wellingtons. After ending its RAF flying training in 1946, the company diversified and built plywood and GRP cabin cruiser boats designed by Alan Eckford, until 1974.

The first flight of the Hawker Hurricane, later a fighter aircraft in the Battle of Britain, occurred at Brooklands on 6 November 1935.

=== World War Two ===
In World War II, the site was again used for military aircraft production, in particular the Vickers Wellington, Vickers Warwick and Hawker Hurricane and was extensively camouflaged. Trees were also planted in some sections of the concrete track to help conceal the Hawker and Vickers aircraft factories there. Despite these efforts, the Vickers factory was successfully bombed by the Luftwaffe and extensively damaged on 4 September 1940 with nearly 90 aircraft workers killed and at least 419 injured. Five unidentified victims were buried in unmarked graves in Burvale Cemetery, Hersham, on 9 September, one of whom was later confirmed to be 36-year-old William E Hunt. On 10 March 2016, thanks to the efforts of local residents, sponsors and supporters, permanent memorials to Mr Hunt and the other four civilians were dedicated by the Reverend Martin Fletcher and Elmbridge Borough Councillor Mary Sheldon. Attendees included relatives of Vickers factory worker Eric S Powell who also died on 4 September 1940 aged 26, and is now believed to be one of the remaining four unidentified casualties buried at Burvale.

The Hawker factory was also bombed and damaged two days later, but with no loss of life or serious disruption to Hurricane production. On 21 September 1940, Lt John MacMillan Stevenson Patton of the Royal Canadian Engineers risked his life when he and five others manhandled an unexploded German bomb away from the Hawker aircraft factory at Brooklands and rolled it into an existing bomb crater where it later exploded harmlessly. His bravery was recognised by the award of the George Cross. The crucial role of Brooklands in the Battle of Britain of 1940 is further explained in displays at Brooklands Museum.
After the bombing of Brooklands in September 1940, the Vickers-Armstrongs Design Department (including Rex Pierson, Barnes Wallis and several hundred others) was dispersed to a secret location at the nearby Burhill Golf Course, just east of St George&#x27;s Hill in Hersham and the Experimental Department led by George Edwards was relocated to temporary premises at Foxwarren in Redhill Road, Cobham. These two facilities played a crucial part in the successful development of the &#x27;Upkeep&#x27; mine—better known today as the &#x27;bouncing bomb&#x27;—conceived by Barnes Wallis and deployed to devastating effect by the Avro Lancaster raid by No. 617 &quot;Dambuster&quot; Squadron RAF led by Guy Gibson against Germany&#x27;s Ruhr Valley reservoirs on the night of 16–17 May 1943.

=== Post-1945 ===
After the war, the circuit was in poor condition and was sold to Vickers-Armstrongs in 1946 for continued use as an aircraft factory. New aircraft types, including the Viking, Valetta, Varsity, Viscount, Vanguard, 1-11 and VC10, were subsequently, designed, manufactured and delivered from there.

In 1951, construction of a new hard runway required a section of the motor circuit&#x27;s Byfleet Banking to be removed to allow Vickers Valiant V bombers to be flown out to nearby Wisley Airfield, which offered a longer runway and less built-up surroundings than Brooklands. That airfield opened as a flight test centre for Vickers in 1944, and was used until 1972, latterly by BAC.

After considerable expansion, due to increasing commercial success in the 1950s, the Vickers factory achieved its peak size in the early 1960s, in preparation for the VC10 manufacturing programme, and became the headquarters of the new British Aircraft Corporation in 1960. Substantial investment in the site at that time saw many new buildings constructed and existing premises modified. First, in the mid-1950s, came a new assembly hall for the Vickers Viscount, known as &#x27;B.1&#x27;, presumably because it consisted of a number of re-purposed standard war-time B.1-type hangars (together with some T.2 hangars), and was rebuilt as one long double-bay structure parallel to the runway.

By 1962, a large new VC10 flight shed hangar was ready to house the prototype VC10 airliner, and a second, even larger, flight shed was added alongside by 1964. The latter was probably the largest aircraft hangar in Europe at the time and became known locally as &quot;The Cathedral&quot;, while the smaller shed was called &quot;The Abbey&quot;. The huge factory at Brooklands went on to design and build the BAC TSR.2, One-Eleven and major assemblies for Concorde.

The cancellation of the V-1000 transport in 1955, the Labour government&#x27;s cancellation of the TSR-2 in 1965, and the disappointing lack of significant orders for VC10s and Concorde, saw the factory contract in the early 1970s. It became part of the newly formed British Aerospace in 1977, and focused on component manufacture for other aircraft. However, closure was announced on 29 July 1986, finally occurring on Christmas Day 1989. BAE&#x27;s successor, BAE Systems, retains a logistics centre at Brooklands.

In November 2009, Brooklands was featured in an episode of a BBC TV series &quot;James May&#x27;s Toy Stories&quot;. May undertook the task of recreating the original track using Scalextric. The show featured May&#x27;s attempt to lay the plastic track through and around the variety of obstacles that have replaced the original track, including a pond, a four-lane road, several houses, fences, and Sony and Procter &amp; Gamble corporate campuses.

==Brooklands Museum==

In 1987, Brooklands Museum Trust was formed with Sir Peter G Masefield as Chairman, and began to record, research, preserving and interpret all aspects the site&#x27;s heritage. The Museum project began after a highly successful temporary exhibition about Brooklands was staged in 1977 by Elmbridge Museum in Weybridge and, with support from British Aerospace, Elmbridge Borough Council, Gallaher Ltd and many dedicated individuals, this led to the selection of a 30-acre heritage site in the northeast corner of Brooklands, by the old Paddock and Finishing Straight. As well as organising numerous aviation, motoring and other events since the mid-1980s, the Museum also staged regular fly-ins for visiting light aircraft from 1991 to 2003 using the northern half of the original tarmac runway and staffed these events with an all-volunteer team.

Brooklands made a notable TV appearance when it featured in the 1990 &#x27;The Disappearance of Mr. Davenheim&#x27; episode of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;, when Hercule Poirot investigates a crime committed involving a racing driver. The banking of Brooklands was also used as a &#x27;road location&#x27; in an episode of &quot;The Bill&quot; where the CID foiled an armed robbery and resulted in a &#x27;shoot out&#x27;. On 1 November 2015, Brooklands was featured in an episode of the British series &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, although the scenes were actually filmed at the Goodwood Circuit. American car enthusiast Barry Meguiar (President and CEO of Meguiar&#x27;s) has featured the Brooklands on his Speed Channel show &quot;Car Crazy&quot;.
In early 2004 the central area of Brooklands including the hard runway and parts of the remaining circuit were sold to DaimlerChrysler UK Retail and Mercedes-Benz World opened to the public on 29 October 2006. This development incorporates a vehicle test tracks (including part of the original Campbell Circuit) and an off-road circuit. Also included is a conference centre and extensive Mercedes-Benz showrooms.

Following significant earlier work by The Brooklands Society (not part of Brooklands Museum), certain buildings (including the 1907 BARC Clubhouse, the 1911 Flight Ticket Office and the 1932 Brooklands Aero Clubhouse), structures and remaining sections of the Track first became the subject of preservation orders from 1975 and this legal protection was reviewed by English Heritage and increased by the DCMS in 2002). A draft Brooklands Conservation Plan was instigated by English Heritage and prepared in 2003 for DaimlerChrysler by DCUK consultants Terence O&#x27;Rourke. A Brooklands Heritage Partnership (BHP) was formed in 2010 as an informal partnership of Brooklands Museum, Elmbridge Borough Council, English Heritage and Surrey County Council, to address increasing conservation issues and concerns. In April 2013, a £32,540 grant was secured from English Heritage (now Historic England) to enable the BHP to appoint professional consultants to research and compile a comprehensive reference document on all aspects of Brooklands&#x27; heritage. A draft version of this new document was available for public consultation via Elmbridge Borough Council and Brooklands Museum from July to August 2017.

On 25 September 2013, the last flying VC10 - an RAF K.3 tanker, serial number ZA147 (originally built as a Super VC10 airliner) - made its final flight from RAF Brize Norton to Bruntingthorpe Airfield, this being the end of the type&#x27;s remarkable 51-year career. Although this aeroplane is due to be scrapped, on the previous day its sister, ZA150, was acquired by Brooklands Museum for preservation at nearby Dunsfold Aerodrome and was delivered there by an RAF 101 Squadron crew. This was the last VC10 built - first flown from Brooklands on 16 February 1970, originally delivered to East African Airways and also one of the last complete aircraft manufactured at Brooklands - the last complete aircraft to be built there, BAC 1-11 D-ANNO, first flew on 19 December 1970. The retirement of these two VC10s also ended a 100-year period of Brooklands-built aeroplanes operated by the British armed forces.

==Brooklands centenary==
Brooklands motor course celebrated its centenary on 16/17 June 2007. Throughout 2007, various special events were organised by Brooklands Museum in order to celebrate its 100th birthday. Events included use of the Byfleet Banking for the first time in nearly 70 years, a Formula One car demonstration by McLaren-Mercedes, driven by Gary Paffett in conjunction with Mercedes-Benz World and a 24-hour slot car race to commemorate S.F. Edge&#x27;s achievement of driving for 24 hours averaging over 60 mph (100 km/h).

==Brooklands today==
Brooklands Museum houses historic aircraft including a Vickers Wellington bomber recovered from Loch Ness in 1985, a British Airways Concorde, G-BBDG (c/n 202), the UK&#x27;s first production Concorde, and now also owns the 40% scale Concorde model &quot;G-CONC&quot; displayed for many years as a gate guardian at Heathrow Airport, until removed in 2007. After restoration and repainting, the model was relocated for similar duty at Brooklands Museum&#x27;s public entrance off Brooklands Drive on 29 September 2012.

There are civil and military aircraft on display including a Vickers Vanguard, Viscount 800 and Standard VC-10. The majority of exhibits were built at Brooklands or have close associations with the site. The VC-10 was built and first flown at Brooklands in 1964 and after airline service with British United as G-ASIX and later British Caledonian Airways, in 1974 it became a VIP aircraft for the then-Sultan Qaboos of Oman until retired on 6 July 1987 and donated to Brooklands Museum by the Sultan&#x27;s Royal Flight.

Although the Circuit is no longer driveable, it can still be simulated in the 1999 released &quot;Spirit of Speed 1937&quot; game for the PC and Dreamcast, in which it was re-created in detail. Several other video games also feature Brooklands and Brooklands Museum&#x27;s Formula 1 simulator also features a detailed computer simulation of the pre-war race track.

In 2009, BBC &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenter James May announced plans to recreate the full length Brooklands using Scalextric track and cars. This was undertaken with a team of 350 volunteers building the track from an uncounted number of pieces of Scalextric track, navigating ponds and roads, closely following the route of the old Brooklands track. This event broke the Guinness World Record for the longest ever Scalextric track in the world, intended to measure the original of the original Brooklands circuit but in reality recording in length (due to the need to navigate modern features that block the original course). The episode was shown on BBC2 on 17 November 2009 as part of &quot;James May&#x27;s Toy Stories&quot;.

BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; was filmed at Brooklands Museum in July 2009 and subsequently produced as two programmes for its next series and first broadcast on 10 and 17 January 2010.

Apart from Brooklands Museum&#x27;s displays and exhibits, today there are a number of memorials to Brooklands. The first of these is the &#x27;Brooklands Memorial&#x27; built by Vickers-Armstrongs to mark the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Motor Course and was unveiled by Lord Brabazon of Tara in July 1957. This impressive concrete faced monument featured a fine bronze letters, plaque and related inscription summarising the site&#x27;s history from 1907–57 and was originally located at the North end of the aerodrome, was designated as a Scheduled Monument in 2002 then relocated and restored in a new position just east of the River Wey on the museum site to make way for the new Mercedes-Benz World complex, which opened in 2006. The original bronze fittings were stolen in the 1970s but the plaque was later found and is now displayed in the main entrance foyer of the former BARC Clubhouse.

A memorial dedicated to Brooklands aircraft design and manufacturing heritage was specially designed and manufactured by British Aerospace in the late 1980s to mark the closing of its last factory there. This takes the form of a large engraved acrylic panel displayed at the southern end of the old runway close to the entrance to the Community Park and a children&#x27;s nursery. Forgotten and overgrown until quite recently, this has now been rediscovered and is still in good condition.

Another initiative was taken in the early 1990s by the developers Trafalgar Brookmount Ltd who commissioned an artist to design and produce two large brown terracotta &#x27;gate statements&#x27;; these are located at the east end of Wellington Way and the south end of Sopwith Drive and feature representative images of Brooklands&#x27; pre-1940 history namely the Napier-Railton, Vickers Vimy and the two former Clubhouses.

In 1993, Prince Michael of Kent officially opened a new Garden of Memories at Brooklands Museum which features a growing number of commemorative plaques in memory of many people who have been associated with Brooklands for more than 100 years.

Much of the novel &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, published in 2006 by the author J. G. Ballard, is set in Brooklands.

In February 2015, it was announced that Brooklands would receive a multimillion-pound facelift. The £4.68 million Heritage Lottery Fund grant funded an £8.5 million &quot;Brooklands Aircraft Factory and Race Track Revival Project&quot;. This resulted in the relocation and restoration of the Grade II Listed 1940 Bellman Hangar complete with a comprehensive new &quot;Aircraft Factory&quot; exhibition inside, as well as construction of a new two-storey Flight Shed housing archives and a workshop on the ground floor with another aircraft exhibition hall above. Restoration of the Northern section of the adjacent Finishing Straight was also part of the scheme and included revealing its largely intact &#x27;lost&#x27; section under the hangar&#x27;s post-war floor. The project was successfully completed and officially opened to the public by Prince Michael of Kent on 13 November 2017.

2017 also saw the completion of a new Brooklands Conservation Management Plan (funded by English Heritage - now Historic England) for the Brooklands Heritage Partnership and among other things, this document set new standards for maintaining and, where practical or necessary, for repairing the surviving sections of the historic Race Track. Further grant aid from Historic England in 2018 enabled an experienced contractor to clear several extensive undergrowth from the largely and seriously neglected western section of the Byfleet Banking. In February 2020, the Byfleet Banking&#x27;s central section was also successfully cleared of leaves, moss and weeds for its owners Marks &amp; Spencer and Tesco.

<doc id="161323" wikidata="Q1483473" url="?curid=161323" title="Military history of the United States">
<text>The military history of the United States spans over four centuries, dating back to 1607 and pre-dating by nearly two centuries the founding of the nation following the American Revolutionary War. During this time, the United States evolved from a colonial territory to newly formed nation following its independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain (1775–1783) to ultimately becoming a world superpower in the aftermath of World War II and through the present. As of 2024, the United States Armed Forces consists of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force and Space Force, all under the command of the Department of Defense, and the Coast Guard, which is controlled by the Department of Homeland Security.

In 1775, the Continental Congress, convening in present-day Independence Hall in Philadelphia, established the Continental Army, the Continental Navy, and the Continental Marines, formally joining and escalating its war for independence in the Revolutionary War. This newly formed military, fighting alongside the Kingdom of France, triumphed over the British in the war, leading to its independence following the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783. In 1789, the new Constitution made the U.S. president the commander-in-chief, and gave Congress the authority to declare war. Major conflicts involving the U.S. military include the American Indian Wars, War of 1812, Mexican-American War, American Civil War, Banana Wars, World War I, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, War in Afghanistan, and Iraq War.

==Colonial wars (1607–1774)==
The beginning of the United States military lies in civilian frontier settlers, armed for hunting and basic survival in the wilderness. These were organized into local militias for small military operations, mostly against Native American tribes but also to resist possible raids by the small military forces of neighboring European colonies. They relied on the British regular Army and Navy for any serious military operation.

In major operations outside the locality involved, the militia was not employed as a fighting force. Instead the colony asked for (and paid) volunteers, many of whom were also militia members.

In the early years of the British colonization of North America, military action in the thirteen colonies that would become the United States were the result of conflicts with Native Americans, such as in the Pequot War of 1637, King Philip&#x27;s War in 1675, the Yamasee War in 1715 and Father Rale&#x27;s War in 1722.

Beginning in 1689, the colonies became involved in a series of wars between Great Britain and France for control of North America, the most important of which were Queen Anne&#x27;s War, in which the British conquered French colony Acadia, and the final French and Indian War (1754–63) when Britain was victorious over all the French colonies in North America. This final war was to give thousands of colonists, including Virginia colonel George Washington, military experience which they put to use during the American Revolutionary War.

===War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear (1739–1748)===

In the struggle for control of North America, the contest between Great Britain and France was the vital one, the conflict with Spain, a declining power, important but secondary. This latter conflict reached its height in the &quot;War of Jenkins Ear,&quot; a prelude to the War of Austrian Succession, which began in 1739 and pitted the British and their American colonists against the Spanish.

In the colonies the war involved a seesaw struggle between the Spanish in Florida and the West Indies and the English colonists in South Carolina and Georgia. Its most notable episode, however, was a British expedition mounted in Jamaica against Cartagena, the main port of the Spanish colony in Colombia. The mainland colonies furnished a regiment to participate in the assault as British Regulars under British command. The expedition ended in disaster, resulting from climate, disease, and the bungling of British commanders, and only about 600 of over 3,000 Americans who participated ever returned to their homes.

==War of Independence (1775–1783)==
By 1774, ongoing political tensions between Great Britain and the Thirteen Colonies led the British to place the province of Massachusetts under martial law after the Patriots protested taxes they regarded as a violation of their constitutional rights as Englishmen. When shooting began at Lexington and Concord in April 1775, militia units from across New England rushed to Boston and bottled up the British in the city. 

In 1775, gathering in present-day Independence Hall in Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress formed the Continental Congress and appointed George Washington as its commander-in-chief, which was augmented throughout the war by colonial militia. In addition to the Army, Congress also created the Continental Navy and Continental Marines. Washington succeeded almost immediately in driving the British Army out of Boston in the Siege of Boston. But in late summer 1776, the British returned to New York, where they nearly captured Washington&#x27;s army. The revolutionaries expelled British officials from the Thirteen Colonies. On 4 July 1776, the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia unanimously adopted and issued the Declaration of Independence, which declared themselves independent from British colonial rule.

In the American Revolutionary War, the British lacked both a unified command and a clear strategy for winning the war. With the use of the Royal Navy, the British were able to capture coastal cities, but control of the countryside eluded them. A British sortie from Canada in 1777 ended with the disastrous surrender of a British army at Saratoga. With the coming in 1777 of General von Steuben, the training and discipline along Prussian lines began, and the Continental Army began to evolve into a modern force. France and Spain then entered the war against Great Britain as Allies of the U.S., ending its naval advantage and escalating the conflict into a world war. The Netherlands later joined France, and the British were outnumbered on land and sea in a world war, as they had no major allies apart from Indian tribes, Loyalists and Hessians.

A shift in focus to the southern American states in 1779 resulted in a string of victories for the British, but General Nathanael Greene engaged in guerrilla warfare and prevented them from making strategic headway. The main British army was surrounded by Washington&#x27;s American and French forces at Yorktown in 1781, as the French fleet blocked a rescue by the Royal Navy. The British then sued for peace.

===George Washington===
General George Washington (1732–1799), who commanded the Continental Army against the British in the American Revolutionary War, proved an excellent organizer and administrator. Washington worked successfully with the Continental Congress and the state governors, selecting and mentoring his senior officers, supporting and training his troops, and maintaining an idealistic Republican Army. His biggest challenge was logistics, since neither the Continental Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, munitions, clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers. As a battlefield tactician, Washington was often outmaneuvered by his British counterparts. As a strategist, however, Washington had a better idea of how to win the war than the British. 

During the Revolutionary War, the British sent four invasion armies. Washington&#x27;s strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776, and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies in the Battle of Saratoga (1777) and Siege of Yorktown (1781). He limited the British control to New York and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population. The Loyalists, on whom the British had relied too heavily, comprised about 20% of the population but were never well organized. As the war ended, Washington watched proudly as what remained of the British Army quietly sailed out of New York City in November 1783, taking the Loyalist leadership with them. Washington later astonished the world when, instead of seizing power, he gave his famed farewell address and retired quietly to his farm in Mount Vernon, Virginia, after serving one term as president from 1789 to 1797.

Patriots had a strong distrust of a permanent standing army, so the Continental Army was quickly demobilized, with land grants to veterans. Throughout the war, Washington deferred to elected officials, averted a potential coup d&#x27;état and resigned as commander-in-chief after the war, establishing a tradition of civil control of the U.S. military.

==Early national period (1783–1812)==
Following the American Revolutionary War, the United States faced potential military conflict on the high seas as well as on the western frontier. The United States was a minor military power during this time, having only a modest army, marine corps, and navy. A traditional distrust of standing armies, combined with faith in the abilities of local militia, precluded the development of well-trained units and a professional officer corps. Jeffersonian leaders preferred a small army and navy, fearing that a large military establishment would involve the United States in excessive foreign wars, and potentially allow a domestic tyrant to seize power.

In the Treaty of Paris after the Revolution, the British had ceded the lands between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River to the United States, without consulting the Shawnee, Cherokee, Choctaw and other smaller tribes who lived there. Because many of the tribes had fought as allies of the British, the United States compelled tribal leaders to sign away lands in postwar treaties, and began dividing these lands for settlement. This provoked a war in the Northwest Territory in which the U.S. forces performed poorly; the Battle of the Wabash in 1791 was the most severe defeat ever suffered by the United States at the hands of American Indians. President Washington dispatched a newly trained army to the region led by General Anthony Wayne, which decisively defeated the Indian confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794.

When revolutionary France declared war on Great Britain in 1793, the United States sought to remain neutral, but the Jay Treaty, which was favorable to Great Britain, angered the French government, which viewed it as a violation of the 1778 Treaty of Alliance. French privateers began to seize U.S. vessels, which led to an undeclared &quot;Quasi-War&quot; between the two nations. Fought at sea from 1798 to 1800, the United States won a string of victories in the Caribbean. George Washington was called out of retirement to head a &quot;provisional army&quot; in case of invasion by France, but President John Adams managed to negotiate a truce, in which France agreed to terminate the prior alliance and cease its attacks. After France and Britain signed the Peace of Amiens leading to a lull in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, President Thomas Jefferson scaled back military spending.

===Barbary Wars===
The Berbers along the Barbary Coast (modern day Libya) sent pirates to capture merchant ships and hold the crews for ransom. The U.S. paid protection money until 1801, when President Thomas Jefferson refused to pay and sent in the Navy to challenge the Barbary States, the First Barbary War followed. After the was captured in 1803, Lieutenant Stephen Decatur led a raid which successfully burned the captured ship, preventing Tripoli from using or selling it. In 1805, after William Eaton captured the city of Derna, Tripoli agreed to a peace treaty. The other Barbary states continued to raid U.S. shipping, until the Second Barbary War in 1815 ended the practice.

==War of 1812==
By far the largest military engagement during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleonic France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian barrier state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. 

Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire, invading British Canada, where they hoped use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada, however, proved a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front, including Tecumseh&#x27;s War and the Creek War, were more successful. After defeating Napoleon in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to invade New York, raid Washington, D.C., and capture the key control of the Mississippi River at New Orleans. The New York invasion was a fiasco after the much larger British Army retreated to Canada. The raiders succeeded in the burning of Washington on 25 August 1814, but were repulsed in their Chesapeake Bay Campaign at the Battle of Baltimore and the British commander killed. The major invasion in Louisiana was stopped by a one-sided military battle that killed the top three British generals and thousands of soldiers. The winners were the commanding general of the Battle of New Orleans, Major General Andrew Jackson, who later became president, and the Americans, who basked in a victory over a much more powerful nation. The peace treaty proved successful, and the U.S. and Britain never again went to war. The losers were the Indians, who never gained the independent territory in the Midwest promised by Britain.

==War with Mexico (1846–1848)==
With the rapid expansion of the farming population, Democrats looked to the west for new lands, an idea which became known as &quot;Manifest Destiny.&quot; In the Texas Revolution (1835–1836), the settlers declared independence as the Republic of Texas and defeated the Mexican Army, but Mexico was determined to reconquer the lost province and threatened war with the U.S. if it annexed Texas. The U.S., much larger and more powerful, did annex Texas in 1845 and war broke out in 1846 over boundary issues.

In the Mexican–American War 1846–1848, the U.S. Army under Generals Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott and others, invaded and after a series of victorious battles (and no major defeats) seized Santa Fe de Nuevo México and Alta California, and also blockaded the coast, invaded northern Mexico, and invaded central Mexico, capturing the national capital of Mexico City. The peace terms involved American purchase of the area from California to New Mexico for $10 million.

==American Civil War (1861–1865)==
Long-building tensions between the Northern and Southern States over slavery suddenly reached a climax after the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln of the new anti-slavery Republican Party as U.S. president. Southern states seceded from the U.S. and formed a separate Confederacy. Within the Confederate states, many U.S. forts with garrisons still loyal to the Union were cut off. Fighting started in 1861 when Fort Sumter was fired upon by Confederate troops and waves of patriotism swept both the North and the South.

The civil war caught both sides with weak military forces. Neither the North&#x27;s small standing army nor the South&#x27;s scattered state militias were capable of winning a civil war. Both sides raced to raise new armies—larger than any U.S. forces before—first with repeated calls for volunteers, but eventually resorting to unpopular large-scale conscription for the first time in U.S. history.

The Union Army initially sought a quick victory by trying to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia, not far from the U.S. capital at Washington, D.C. The Confederate States Army hoped to win by getting Britain and France to intervene, or else by exhausting the North&#x27;s willingness to fight.

As the fighting between the two capitals stalled, the North found more success in campaigns elsewhere, using rivers, railroads, and the seas to help move and supply their larger forces, putting a stranglehold on the South—the Anaconda Plan. The war spilled across the continent, and even to the high seas. After four years of appallingly bloody conflict, with more casualties than all other U.S. wars combined, the North&#x27;s larger population and industrial might slowly ground the South down. The resources and economy of the South were ruined, while the North&#x27;s factories and economy prospered filling government wartime contracts.

The American Civil War is sometimes called the &quot;first modern war&quot; due to the mobilization and destruction of the civilian base—total war—and due to by many technical military innovations involving railroads, telegraphs, rifles, trench warfare, and ironclad warships with turret guns.

==Post-Civil War era (1865–1917)==
===Indian Wars (1865–1891)===

After the Civil War, population expansion, railroad construction, and the culling of the buffalo herds heightened military tensions on the Great Plains. Specifically, according to Colville scholar Dina Gilio-Whitaker in her book As Long as Grass Grows, &quot;While the railroads wreaked havoc on Indian lives in numerous ways, one of the most destructive and tragic outcomes of the United States&#x27; industrial expansion was the near extermination of the Plains buffalo herds, with the railroads as the strategic prerequisite to carry out the plan&quot;. So extreme was the buffalo extermination that by the 1890s fewer than one thousand remained, scattered mostly on private ranches. Several tribes, especially the Sioux and Comanche, fiercely resisted confinement to reservations. The main role of the Army was to keep indigenous peoples on reservations and to end their wars against settlers and each other, William Tecumseh Sherman and Philip Sheridan were in charge. A famous victory for the Plains Nations was the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876, when Col. George Armstrong Custer and two hundred plus members of the 7th Cavalry were killed by a force consisting of Native Americans from the Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho nations. The last significant conflict came in 1891 and ended in the Wounded Knee Massacre.

===Spanish–American War (1898)===

The Spanish–American War was a short but decisive war marked by quick, overwhelming American victories at sea and on land against the Spanish Empire. The Navy was well-prepared and won laurels, even as politicians tried (and failed) to have it redeployed to defend East Coast cities against potential threats from the feeble Spanish Navy fleet. The Army performed well in combat in Cuba. However, it was too oriented to small posts in the West and not as well-prepared for an overseas conflict. It relied on volunteers and state militia units, which faced logistical, training and food problems in the staging areas in Florida. The United States freed Cuba (after an occupation by the U.S. Army). By the peace treaty Spain ceded to the United States its colonies of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. The Navy set up coaling stations there and in Hawaii (which was forcibly overthrown in 1893, via a coup d&#x27;état against Queen Liliʻuokalani and annexed later in 1898). The U.S. Navy now had a major forward presence across the Pacific Ocean and (with the lease of Guantánamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba) a major base in the Caribbean guarding the approaches to the Gulf Coast and the Panama Canal.

To win its first colonies, the U.S. had lost 385 KIA (369 Army, 10 Navy, 6 Marines); 1,662 WIA (1,594 Army, 47 Navy, 21 Marines); and 2,061 dead of disease in the combat zones (a total of 5,403 died of disease at all locations, including stateside posts). Total Spanish combat deaths in action against U.S. forces were about 900.

===Philippine–American War (1899–1902)===

The Philippine–American War (1899–1902) was an armed conflict between a group of Filipino revolutionaries and the American forces following the ceding of the Philippines to the United States after the defeat of Spanish forces in the Battle of Manila. The Army sent in 100,000 soldiers (mostly from the National Guard) under General Elwell Otis. Defeated in the field and losing its capital in March 1899, the poorly armed and poorly led rebels broke into armed bands. The insurgency collapsed in March 1901 when the leader Emilio Aguinaldo was captured by General Frederick Funston and his Macabebe allies. Casualties included 1,037 Americans killed in action and 3,340 who died from disease; 20,000 rebels were killed. The war resulted in at least 200,000 Filipino civilian deaths, mostly due to famine and disease. Some estimates for total civilian dead reach up to a million. Atrocities were committed by the U.S. during the conflict, including reprisals, scorched earth campaigns, and the forcible relocation of many civilians.

=== Overthrow of Hawaii (1893) ===
The overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom began on 16 January 1893, with a coup d&#x27;état against Queen Liliʻuokalani on the island of O&#x27;ahu. The coup d’état was predated by several events, such as the 1887 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom, also referred to as the Bayonet Constitution which was prepared by pro-American residents to strip the Hawaiian monarchy of its power and consolidate power among the non-Native settlers in Hawai&#x27;i. It became known as the Bayonet Constitution because of the armed militia used to intimidate King Kalākaua and force him to sign it or be removed.

The coup d&#x27;état was led by the Committee of Safety, a 13-member group made up of non-native Hawaiian&#x27;s. The Committee of Safety initiated the overthrow by organizing a group armed non-native men to depose Queen Liliʻuokalani. The United States Military forces involved in the coup d’état consisted of 1 cruiser, the , and 162 U.S. Navy and USMC personnel. This military presence was justified by the supposed threats to non-combatant American lives, property, and economic interests, largely of plantations. The insurgency led to the house arrest of Queen Liliʻuokalani who stayed in ʻIolani Palace until her death in 1917. The ultimate goal of the coup d’état was eventual annexation into the United States. The insurgents formed the Republic of Hawai&#x27;i which instated Sanford B. Dole, as the republic&#x27;s first President. It was backed by the sugar plantation owners in Hawai&#x27;i, such as Dole. Hawaii was annexed by the United States in 1898. The United States military still has a prominent presence in Hawai&#x27;i, and they have been linked to several instances of environmental degradation and causes of pollution.

==Modernization==
The Navy was modernized in the 1880s, and by the 1890s had adopted the naval power strategy of Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan—as indeed did every major navy. The old sailing ships were replaced by modern steel battleships, bringing them in line with the navies of Britain and Germany. In 1907, most of the Navy&#x27;s battleships, with several support vessels, dubbed the Great White Fleet, were featured in a 14-month circumnavigation of the world. Ordered by President Theodore Roosevelt, it was a mission designed to demonstrate the Navy&#x27;s capability to extend to the global theater.

Secretary of War Elihu Root (1899–1904) led the modernization of the Army. His goal of a uniformed chief of staff as general manager and a European-type general staff for planning was stymied by General Nelson A. Miles but did succeed in enlarging West Point and establishing the U.S. Army War College as well as the General Staff. Root changed the procedures for promotions and organized schools for the special branches of the service. He also devised the principle of rotating officers from staff to line. Root was concerned about the Army&#x27;s role in governing the new territories acquired in 1898 and worked out the procedures for turning Cuba over to the Cubans, and wrote the charter of government for the Philippines.

Rear Admiral Bradley A. Fiske was at the vanguard of new technology in naval guns and gunnery, thanks to his innovations in fire control 1890–1910. He immediately grasped the potential for air power, and called for the development of a torpedo plane. Fiske, as aide for operations in 1913–15 to Assistant Secretary Franklin D. Roosevelt, proposed a radical reorganization of the Navy to make it a war-fighting instrument. Fiske wanted to centralize authority in a chief of naval operations and an expert staff that would develop new strategies, oversee the construction of a larger fleet, coordinate war planning including force structure, mobilization plans, and industrial base, and ensure that the U.S. Navy possessed the best possible war machines. Eventually, the Navy adopted his reforms and by 1915 started to reorganize for possible involvement in the World War then underway.

==Banana Wars (1898–1935)==
Banana Wars is an informal term for the minor intervention in Latin America from 1898 until 1935. These include military presence in Cuba, Panama with the Panama Canal Zone, Haiti (1915–1935), Dominican Republic (1916–1924) and Nicaragua (1912–1925; 1926–1933). The U.S. Marine Corps began to specialize in long-term military occupation of these countries, primarily to safeguard customs revenues which were the cause of local civil wars. For example, in May 1912, during the Negro Rebellion by Afro-Cuban rebels, President William H. Taft sent 1,292 men to Cuba to protect the American-owned sugarcane plantations and their associated properties, as well as copper mines, railroads, and trains. The rebellion occurred primarily in Oriente Province. In the end, between 3,000 and 6,000 Afro-Cubans, including civilians were killed by the Cuban Army during the suppression of the rebellion which was completed by July 1912. The rebels attacked the Marines only once, at El Cuero, but were repulsed without casualties on either side.

===Hispaniola===

Banditry and guerrilla resistance was endemic throughout the period of occupation. U.S. Marine losses in the Dominican Republic, 1916–1922, totaled 17 killed, 54 dead, 55 wounded (from a peak strength of 3,000). The Marines inflicted about 1,000 Dominican casualties. The most serious insurgencies occurred in Haiti, where some 5,000 rough mountaineers of the north, called Cacos, rebelled in 1915–17, losing 200 killed, to Marine losses of 3 KIA, 18 WIA, of 2,029 deployed. In 1918, the Cacos, angered by the Marine-enforced practice of corvée (forced labor), followed the leadership of Charlemagne Peralte and Benoit Batraville into rebellion again, against the 1,500-man 1st Marine Brigade and the 2,700-man Haitian Gendarmerie. The rebellion lasted for more than 19 months, 17 October 1918 – 19 May 1920. Both Caco leaders were killed in battle, along with at least 2,004 of their men. The Marines lost 28 slain in action and the Gendarmerie lost 70 killed.

==Moro Rebellion (1899–1913)==

The Moro Rebellion was an armed insurgency between Muslim Filipino tribes in the southern Philippines between 1899 and 1913. Pacification was never complete as sporadic antigovernment insurgency continues into the 21st century, with American advisors helping the Philippine government forces.

==Mexico (1910–1919)==
The Mexican Revolution involved repeated coups overthrowing the national government. This was a violation of democracy that President Woodrow Wilson would not permit. He sent U.S. forces to occupy the Mexican city of Veracruz for six months in 1914, when the &quot;Tampico Affair&quot; of 9 April 1914 occurred, involving the arrest of American sailors by soldiers of the regime of Mexican President Victoriano Huerta. In early 1916, the Mexican general Pancho Villa, a presidential contender who had suffered defeats, sent 500 soldiers on a murderous raid on the American city of Columbus, New Mexico. Wilson sent the U.S. Army under General John J. Pershing to punish Villa in the Pancho Villa Expedition. Villa fled deep into Mexico, with the Americans in pursuit. Mexican nationalism turned against the U.S., and with war looming with Germany, Wilson ordered Pershing to withdraw, and Villa escaped.

==World War I (1917–1918)==
The United States originally wished to remain neutral when World War I broke out in August 1914. However, it insisted on its right as a neutral party to immunity from German submarine attack, even though its ships carried food and raw materials to Britain. In 1917 the Germans resumed submarine attacks, knowing that it would lead to American entry. When the United States declared war in early April 1917, the United States Army was still small by European standards (most of which had conscription) and mobilization would take at least a year. Meanwhile, the United States continued to provide supplies and money to Britain and France, and initiated the first peacetime draft. Industrial mobilization took longer than expected, so divisions were sent to Europe without equipment, relying instead on the British and French to supply them.

By summer 1918, a million American soldiers, or &quot;doughboys&quot; as they were often called, of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) were in Europe, serving on the Western Front under the command of General John Pershing, with 10,000 more arriving every day. The failure of the German Army&#x27;s Spring Offensive exhausted its manpower reserves and it was unable to launch new offensives. The Imperial German Navy and home front then revolted and a new German government signed a conditional surrender, the Armistice, ending the war on the Western Front on 11 November 1918.

==Russian Civil War (1918–1925)==

The so-called Polar Bear Expedition was the involvement of 5,000 U.S. troops, during the Russian Civil War, in blocking the Bolsheviks in Arkhangelsk, Russia as part of the greater Allied military expedition in the Russian Civil War. There was no significant combat for the Americans.

==1920s: Naval disarmament==
The U.S. sponsored a major world conference to limit the naval armaments of world powers, including the U.S., Britain, Japan, and France, plus smaller nations. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes made the key proposal of each country to reduce its number of warships by a formula that was accepted. The conference enabled the great powers to reduce their navies and avoid conflict in the Pacific. The treaties remained in effect for ten years, but were not renewed as tensions escalated.

==1930s: Neutrality Acts==
After the costly U.S. involvement in World War I, isolationism grew within the nation. Congress refused membership in the League of Nations, particularly due to Article X of the League&#x27;s charter. Pursuant to Article X, the charter would have required by contract the United States Military to intervene if a member of the League were attacked; this prompted the United States Senate to vehemently oppose the Treaty of Versailles. Isolationism further grew after the events of the Nye Committee, which investigated corrupt military spending and fueled the &quot;Merchants of death&quot; argument, thus increasing anti-war opinions.

In response to the growing turmoil in Europe and Asia, the gradually more restrictive Neutrality Acts were passed, which were intended to prevent the U.S. from supporting either side in a war. President Franklin D. Roosevelt sought to support Britain, however, and in 1940 signed the Lend-Lease Act, which permitted an expansion of the &quot;cash and carry&quot; arms trade to develop with Britain, which controlled the Atlantic sea lanes.

Roosevelt favored the Navy (he was in effective charge in World War I), and used relief programs such as the Public Works Administration to support Navy yards and build warships. For example, in 1933 he authorized $238 million in PWA funds for thirty-two new ships. The Army Air Corps received only $11 million, which barely covered replacements and allowed no expansion.

Due to the underlying pressure against military involvement by both citizens and politicians, the United States was reluctant to intervene in any overseas conflicts. The involvement that the United States had toward the Japanese Invasion of Manchuria in 1931 only extended as far as non-recognition. Other events such as Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italian Conquest of Ethiopia went ignored by the U.S. along with the League of Nations being unable to act upon the usage of chemical weapons by the Italian fascists. No official involvement was waged during the Spanish Civil War and the Second Sino-Japanese War, though both wars utilized loopholes for U.S. involvement, such as volunteering and using British ships as a middleman for delivering provisions (since the Neutrality Acts only specified American ships). This, along with Roosevelt&#x27;s Quarantine Speech, produced mixed opinions among Americans that were still anxious about military involvement. Non-interventionists were mainly constituent in the Republican Party, but other Democratic politicians, such as Louis Ludlow, attempted to pass bills to compromise and even amend the United States Constitution for the purpose of calling for public Referendum to decide military involvement in cases that do not immediately follow an attack on the United States. This amendment was introduced many times, but failed to gain enough support, including opposition even by Roosevelt.

The overall neglect for military involvement eventually resulted in appeasement in the early stages of World War II, at the distress of Roosevelt (who wanted to continue cash-and-carry for the European theater and the Pacific). After being rebuffed by Congress for attempting to reinstate cash-and-carry for the European theater, Roosevelt eventually won the favor of restoring the arms trade with belligerent nations after Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland, which is said by many to have fixed the United States economy. Total involvement in the war began after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, where isolationism began to cede.

==World War II (1941–1945)==
Starting in 1940 (18 months before Pearl Harbor), the nation mobilized, giving high priority to air power. American involvement in World War II in 1940–41 was limited to providing materiel and financial support to Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Republic of China. The U.S. entered officially on 8 December 1941 following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Japanese forces soon seized American, British and Dutch possessions across the Pacific and Southeast Asia, with Hawaii and Australia serving as the main staging points for the eventual liberation of these territories.

The loss of eight battleships and 2,403 Americans at Pearl Harbor forced the U.S. to rely on its remaining aircraft carriers, which won a major victory over Japan at Midway just six months into the war, and on its growing submarine fleet. The Navy and Marine Corps followed this up with an island hopping campaign across the central and south Pacific in 1943–1945, reaching the outskirts of Japan in the Battle of Okinawa. During 1942 and 1943, the U.S. deployed millions of men and thousands of planes and tanks to the UK, beginning with the strategic bombing of Nazi Germany and occupied Europe and leading up to the Allied invasions of occupied North Africa in November 1942, Sicily and Italy in 1943, France in 1944, and the invasion of Germany in 1945, parallel with the Soviet invasion from the Eastern Front. That led to the surrender of Nazi Germany in May 1945. While the final European Axis Powers were defeated within a year of Operation Overlord, the fighting in Central Europe was especially bloody for the United States, with more U.S. military deaths occurring in Germany than in any other country during the war.

In the Pacific, the U.S. experienced much success in naval campaigns during 1944, but bloody battles at Iwo Jima and Okinawa in 1945 led the U.S. to look for a way to end the war with minimal loss of American lives. The U.S. used atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to destroy the Japanese war effort and to shock the Japanese leadership, which quickly caused the surrender of Japan. Following the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan surrendered to the Allied forces on 15 August 1945, ending 35 years of Japanese occupation of Korean Peninsula. American forces under General John R. Hodge arrived at the southern part of the Korean Peninsula on 8 September 1945, while the Soviet Army and some Korean Communists had stationed themselves in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula.

The United States was able to mobilize quickly, eventually becoming the dominant military power in most theaters of the war (excepting only Central and Eastern Europe), and the industrial might of the U.S. economy became a major factor in the Allies&#x27; mobilization of resources. Strategic and tactical lessons learned by the U.S., such as the importance of air superiority and the dominance of the aircraft carrier in naval actions, continue to guide U.S. military doctrine into the 21st century.World War II holds a special place in the American psyche as the country&#x27;s greatest triumph, and the U.S. military personnel of World War II are frequently referred to as &quot;the Greatest Generation.&quot; Over 16 million served (about 11% of the population), and over 400,000 died during the war. The U.S. emerged as one of the two undisputed superpowers along with the Soviet Union, and unlike the Soviet Union, the U.S. homeland was virtually untouched by the ravages of war. During and following World War II, the United States and Britain developed an increasingly strong defense and intelligence relationship. Manifestations of this include extensive basing of U.S. forces in the UK, shared intelligence, shared military technology (e.g. nuclear technology), and shared procurement.

==Cold War era (1945–1991)==
Following World War II, the United States emerged as a global superpower vis-a-vis the Soviet Union in the Cold War. In this period of some forty years, the United States provided foreign military aid and direct involvement in proxy wars against the Soviet Union. It was the principal foreign actor in the Korean War and Vietnam War during this era. Nuclear weapons were held in ready by the United States under a concept of mutually assured destruction with the Soviet Union.

===Postwar military reorganization (1947)===
The National Security Act of 1947, meeting the need for a military reorganization to complement the U.S. superpower role, combined and replaced the former Department of the Navy and War Department with a single cabinet-level Department of Defense. The act also created the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Air Force.

===Korean War (1950–1953)===
The Korean War was a conflict between the United States and its United Nations allies and the communist powers under influence of the Soviet Union (also a UN member nation) and the People&#x27;s Republic of China (which later also gained UN membership). The principal combatants were North and South Korea. Principal allies of South Korea included the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, although many other nations sent troops under the aegis of the United Nations Command. Allies of North Korea included the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which supplied military forces, and the Soviet Union, which supplied combat advisors and aircraft pilots, as well as arms, for the Chinese and North Korean troops.

The war started badly for the U.S. and UN. The Korean People&#x27;s Army struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered U.S. and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-U.S.-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country. MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel. North and South Korea are still &quot;de jure&quot; in a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign policy.

===Lebanon crisis of 1958===

In the 1958 Lebanon crisis that threatened civil war, Operation Blue Bat deployed several hundred Marines to bolster the pro-Western Lebanese government from 15 July to 25 October 1958.

===Dominican Intervention===

On 28 April 1965, 400 Marines were landed in Santo Domingo to evacuate the American Embassy and foreign nationals after dissident Dominican armed forces attempted to overthrow the ruling civilian junta. By mid-May, peak strength of 23,850 U.S. soldiers, Marines, and Airmen were in the Dominican Republic and some 38 naval ships were positioned offshore. They evacuated nearly 6,500 men, women, and children of 46 nations, and distributed more than 8 million tons of food.

The intervention cost the U.S. 27 KIA and 172 WIA. Another 20 Americans died from non-hostile causes; 111 were seriously injured. Ten of the KIA were Marines; 13 were from the 82nd Airborne. Among the 2,850 Dominican dead were 325 National Police officers and 500 members of the armed forces. An estimated 600 rebels were killed. Civilians accounted for the remainder.

===Vietnam War (1955–1975)===


The Vietnam War was a war fought between 1955 and 1975 on the ground in South Vietnam and bordering areas of Cambodia and Laos (&quot;see&quot; Secret War) and in the strategic bombing (&quot;see&quot; Operation Rolling Thunder) of North Vietnam. American advisors came in the late 1950s to help the RVN (Republic of Vietnam) combat Communist insurgents known as &quot;Viet Cong.&quot; Major American military involvement began in 1964, after Congress provided President Lyndon B. Johnson with blanket approval for presidential use of force in the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.

Fighting on one side was a coalition of forces including the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam or the &quot;RVN&quot;), the United States, supplemented by South Korea, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines. The allies fought against the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) as well as the National Liberation Front (NLF, also known as Viet communists Viet Cong), or &quot;VC&quot;, a guerrilla force within South Vietnam. The NVA received substantial military and economic aid from the Soviet Union and China, turning Vietnam into a proxy war.

The military history of the American side of the war involved different strategies over the years. The bombing campaigns of the Air Force were tightly controlled by the White House for political reasons, and until 1972 avoided the main Northern cities of Hanoi and Haiphong and concentrated on bombing jungle supply trails, especially the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The most controversial Army commander was William Westmoreland whose strategy involved systematic defeat of all enemy forces in the field, despite heavy American casualties that alienated public opinion back home.

The U.S. framed the war as part of its policy of containment of Communism in Southeast Asia, but American forces were frustrated by an inability to engage the enemy in decisive battles, corruption and supposed incompetence in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, and ever-increasing protests at home. The Tet Offensive in 1968, although a major military defeat for the NLF with nearly half their forces eliminated, marked the psychological turning point in the war. Furthermore, the revelation, in November 1969, of the 1968 My Lai massacre of 347 to 504 Vietnamese civilians by American soldiers further increased opposition to U.S. involvement in the war. With President Richard M. Nixon opposed to containment and more interested in achieving détente with both the Soviet Union and China, American policy shifted to &quot;Vietnamization,&quot; – providing very large supplies of arms and letting the Vietnamese fight it out themselves. After more than 58,000 dead and many more wounded, American forces withdrew in 1973 with no clear victory, and in 1975 South Vietnam was finally conquered by communist North Vietnam and unified.

Memories and lessons from the war are still a major factor in American politics. One side views the war as a necessary part of the Containment policy, which allowed the enemy to choose the time and place of warfare. Others note the U.S. made major strategic gains as the Communists were defeated in Indonesia, and by 1972 both Moscow and Beijing were competing for American support, at the expense of their allies in Hanoi. Critics see the conflict as a &quot;quagmire&quot;—an endless waste of American blood and treasure in a conflict that did not concern U.S. interests. Fears of another quagmire have been major factors in foreign policy debates ever since. The draft became extremely unpopular, and President Nixon ended it in 1973, forcing the military (the Army especially) to rely entirely upon volunteers. That raised the issue of how well the professional military reflected overall American society and values; the soldiers typically took the position that their service represented the highest and best American values.

Between 966,000 and 3,010,000 Vietnamese people died during the war, including between 405,000 and 627,000 civilians. Additionally, the effects of Agent Orange and other chemicals used during Operation Ranch Hand, a military operation aimed at depriving the Vietcong of food and vegetation cover, continue to damage the environment and cause illness among Vietnamese people and their descendants. The soil in Vietnam still tests positive for many of the chemicals used. These chemicals are known to cause numerous health effects such as multiple cancers, peripheral neuropathy, and spina bifida in those exposed and their descendants

===Grenada===
In October, 1983, a power struggle in Grenada, which had installed a communist-leaning government, led to increased tensions in the region. Prime Minister Maurice Bishop was deposed on 16 October by Hudson Austin, and executed on 19 October. Neighboring nations asked the U.S. to intervene. The invasion was a hurriedly devised grouping of paratroopers, Marines, Rangers, and special operations forces in Operation Urgent Fury. The invasion began on 25 October. Over a thousand Americans quickly seized the entire island, fighting both Grenadian and Cuban soldiers, and taking hundreds of military and civilian prisoners, especially Cubans, who were building a large military airstrip.

===Beirut===

In 1983 fighting between Palestinian refugees and Lebanese factions reignited that nation&#x27;s long-running civil war. A UN agreement brought an international force of peacekeepers to occupy Beirut and guarantee security. U.S. Marines landed in August 1982 along with Italian and French forces. On 23 October 1983, a suicide bomber driving a truck filled with 6 tons of TNT crashed through a fence and destroyed the Marine barracks, killing 241 Marines; seconds later, a second bomber leveled a French barracks, killing 58. Subsequently, the U.S. Navy engaged in bombing of militia positions inside Lebanon. While U.S. President Ronald Reagan was initially defiant, political pressure at home eventually forced the withdrawal of the Marines in February 1984.

===Libya===
Code-named Operation El Dorado Canyon, comprised the joint United States Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps air-strikes against Libya on 15 April 1986. The attack was carried out in response to the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing, and resulted in the killing of 45 officers and 15 civilians.

===Panama===

On 20 December 1989 the United States invaded Panama, mainly from U.S. bases within the then-Canal Zone, to oust dictator and international drug trafficker Manuel Noriega. American forces quickly overwhelmed the Panamanian Defense Forces, Noriega was captured on 3 January 1990 and imprisoned in the U.S. and a new government was installed.

==Post–Cold War era (1990–2001)==
===Gulf War (1990–1991)===

The Gulf War was a conflict between Iraq and a coalition force of 34 nations led by the United States. The lead up to the war began with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 which was met with immediate economic sanctions by the United Nations against Iraq. The coalition commenced hostilities in January 1991, resulting in a decisive victory for the U.S. led coalition forces, which drove the Iraqi Armed Forces out of Kuwait with minimal coalition deaths. Despite the low death toll, over 180,000 U.S. veterans would later be classified as &quot;permanently disabled&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (see Gulf War Syndrome). The main battles were aerial and ground combat within Iraq, Kuwait and bordering areas of Saudi Arabia. Land combat did not expand outside of the immediate Iraq/Kuwait/Saudi border region, although the coalition bombed cities and strategic targets across Iraq, and Iraq fired Scud missiles on Israeli and Saudi cities.

Before the war, many observers believed the U.S. and its allies could win but might suffer substantial casualties (certainly more than any conflict since Vietnam), and that the tank battles across the harsh desert might rival those of North Africa during World War II. After nearly 50 years of proxy wars, and constant fears of another war in Europe between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, some thought the Persian Gulf War might finally answer the question of which military philosophy would have reigned supreme. Iraqi forces were battle-hardened after 8 years of war with Iran, and they were well equipped with late model Soviet tanks and jet fighters, but the antiaircraft weapons were crippled; in comparison, the U.S. had no large-scale combat experience since its withdrawal from Vietnam nearly 20 years earlier, and major changes in U.S. doctrine, equipment and technology since then had never been tested under fire.

The battle, however, was largely one-sided from its beginning. The reasons for this are the subject of continuing study by military strategists and academics. There is general agreement that U.S. technological superiority was a crucial factor but the speed and scale of the Iraqi collapse has also been attributed to poor strategic and tactical leadership and low morale among Iraqi troops, which resulted from a history of incompetent leadership. After devastating initial strikes against Iraqi air defenses and command and control facilities on 17 January 1991, coalition forces achieved total air superiority almost immediately. The Iraqi Air Force was destroyed within a few days, with some planes fleeing to Iran, where they were interned for the duration of the conflict. The overwhelming technological advantages of the U.S., such as stealth aircraft and infrared sights, quickly turned the air war into a &quot;turkey shoot&quot;. The heat signature of any tank which started its engine made an easy target. Air defense radars were quickly destroyed by radar-seeking missiles fired from wild weasel aircraft. Grainy video clips, shot from the nose cameras of missiles as they aimed at impossibly small targets, were a staple of U.S. news coverage and revealed to the world a new kind of war, compared by some to a video game. Over 6 weeks of relentless pounding by planes and helicopters, the Iraqi Army was almost completely beaten but did not retreat, under orders from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and by the time the ground forces invaded on 24 February, many Iraqi troops quickly surrendered to forces much smaller than their own; in one instance, Iraqi forces attempted to surrender to a television camera crew that was advancing with coalition forces.

After just 100 hours of ground combat, and with all of Kuwait and much of southern Iraq under coalition control, U.S. President George H. W. Bush ordered a cease-fire and negotiations began resulting in an agreement for cessation of hostilities. Some U.S. politicians were disappointed by this move, believing Bush should have pressed on to Baghdad and removed Hussein from power; there is little doubt that coalition forces could have accomplished this if they had desired. Still, the political ramifications of removing Hussein would have broadened the scope of the conflict greatly, and many coalition nations refused to participate in such an action, believing it would create a power vacuum and destabilize the region.

Following the Persian Gulf War, to protect minority populations, the U.S., Britain, and France declared and maintained no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq, which the Iraqi military frequently tested. The no-fly zones persisted until the 2003 invasion of Iraq, although France withdrew from participation in patrolling the no-fly zones in 1996, citing a lack of humanitarian purpose for the operation.

===Somalia===

U.S. troops participated in a UN peacekeeping mission in Somalia beginning in 1992. By 1993 the American troops were augmented with Rangers and special forces with the aim of capturing warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid, whose forces had massacred peacekeepers from Pakistan. During a raid in downtown Mogadishu, U.S. troops became trapped overnight by a general uprising in the Battle of Mogadishu. Eighteen American soldiers were killed, and a U.S. television crew filmed graphic images of the body of one soldier being dragged through the streets by an angry mob. Somali guerrillas paid a staggering toll at an estimated 1,000–5,000 total casualties during the conflict. After much public disapproval, American forces were quickly withdrawn by President Bill Clinton. The incident profoundly affected American views on peacekeeping and intervention. The book &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; was written about the battle, and was the basis for the later movie of the same name.

===Haiti===
Operation Uphold Democracy (19 September 1994 – 31 March 1995) was an intervention designed to reinstate the elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was reported to have died in office during the bombing of the presidential palace. The operation was effectively authorized by the 31 July 1994 United Nations Security Council Resolution 940.

===Yugoslavia===

During the Yugoslav Wars in the early 1990s, the U.S. operated in Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of the NATO-led multinational implementation force (IFOR) in Operation Joint Endeavour. The U.S. was one of the NATO member countries who bombed Yugoslavia between 24 March and 9 June 1999 during the Kosovo War and later contributed to the multinational force KFOR.

==War on terror (2001–2021)==

The War on Terror is a global effort by the governments of several countries (primarily the United States and its principal allies) to neutralize international terrorist groups (primarily Islamic terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda) and ensure that countries considered by the U.S. and some of its allies to be &quot;rogue nations&quot; no longer support terrorist activities. It has been adopted primarily as a response to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Since 2001, terrorist motivated attacks upon service members have occurred in Arkansas and Texas.

===Afghanistan===
The intervention in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan) to depose that country&#x27;s Taliban government and destroy training camps associated with al-Qaeda is understood to have been the opening, and in many ways defining, campaign of the broader War on Terrorism. The emphasis on Special Operations Forces (SOF), political negotiation with autonomous military units, and the use of proxy militaries marked a significant change from prior U.S. military approaches.

On 29 February 2020, the United States and the Taliban signed a conditional peace deal in Doha which required that U.S. troops withdraw from Afghanistan within 14 months so long as the Taliban cooperated with the terms of the agreement not to &quot;allow any of its members, other individuals or groups, including al-Qaeda, to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies&quot;. The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was not a party to the deal and rejected its terms regarding release of prisoners. After Joe Biden became president, he moved back the target withdrawal date to 31 August 2021 from April.

The withdrawal coincided with the 2021 Taliban offensive. During the offensive, the U.S. carried out limited airstrikes in support of Afghan forces and to destroy captured equipment. The Taliban defeated the Afghan Armed Forces culminating with the fall of Kabul on 15 August 2021. On the same day, the president of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani fled to Tajikistan and the Taliban declared victory and the war over. The U.S. military took control of Kabul&#x27;s airport as part of Operation Allies Refuge to evacuate citizens and certain Afghans.

===Philippines===

In January 2002, the U.S. sent more than 1,200 troops (later raised to 2,000) to assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines in combating terrorist groups linked to al-Qaeda, such as Abu Sayyaf, under Operation Enduring Freedom – Philippines. Operations have taken place mostly in the Sulu Archipelago, where terrorists and other groups are active. The majority of troops provide logistics. However, there are special forces troops that are training and assisting in combat operations against the terrorist groups.

===Iraq War===
After the lengthy Iraq disarmament crisis culminated with an American demand that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein leave Iraq, which was refused, a coalition led by the United States and the United Kingdom fought the Iraqi Armed Forces in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Approximately 250,000 United States troops, with support from 45,000 British, 2,000 Australian and 200 Polish combat forces, entered Iraq primarily through their staging area in Kuwait. (Turkey had refused to permit its territory to be used for an invasion from the north.) Coalition forces also supported Iraqi Kurdish militia, estimated to number upwards of 50,000. After approximately three weeks of fighting, Hussein and the Ba&#x27;ath Party were forcibly removed, followed by 9 years of military presence by the United States and the coalition fighting alongside the newly elected Iraqi government against various insurgent groups.

===Libyan intervention===
As a result of the Libyan Civil War, the United Nations enacted United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, which imposed a no-fly zone over Libya, and the protection of civilians from the forces of Muammar Gaddafi. The United States, along with Britain, France and several other nations, committed a coalition force against Gaddafi&#x27;s forces. On 19 March 2011, the first U.S. action was taken when 114 Tomahawk missiles launched by American and British warships destroyed shoreline air defenses of the Gaddafi regime. The U.S. continued to play a major role in Operation Unified Protector, the NATO-directed mission that eventually incorporated all of the military coalition&#x27;s actions in the theater. Throughout the conflict however, the U.S. maintained it was playing a supporting role only and was following the UN mandate to protect civilians, while the real conflict was between Gaddafi loyalists and Libyan rebels fighting to depose him. During the conflict, American drones were also deployed.

===Syrian and Iraqi intervention===
With the emergence of the Islamic State and its capture of large areas of Iraq and Syria, a number of crises resulted that sparked international attention. ISIL had perpetrated sectarian killings and war crimes in both Iraq and Syria. Gains made in the Iraq War were rolled back as Iraqi army units abandoned their posts. Cities were taken over by the terrorist group which enforced its brand of Sharia law. The kidnapping and decapitation of numerous Western journalists and aid-workers also garnered interest and outrage among Western powers. The U.S. intervened with airstrikes in Iraq over ISIL held territories and assets in August, and in September a coalition of U.S. and Middle Eastern powers initiated a bombing campaign in Syria aimed at degrading and destroying ISIL and Al-Nusra-held territory. By December 2017, ISIL had no remaining territory in Iraq, following the 2017 Western Iraq campaign and lost all remaining territory in Syria in March 2019. Airstrikes by U.S. and Coalition forces have continued in Syria against the Assad government especially after the Douma chemical attack in 2018.

<text>&#x27; (, An Andalusian Dog&quot;&quot;&#x27;) is a 1929 French silent short film directed, produced and edited by Luis Buñuel, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Salvador Dalí. Buñuel&#x27;s first film, it was initially released in a limited capacity at Studio des Ursulines in Paris, but became popular and ran for eight months.

 has no plot in the conventional sense of the word. With disjointed chronology, jumping from the initial &quot;once upon a time&quot; to &quot;eight years later&quot; without events or characters changing, it uses dream logic in narrative flow that can be described in terms of the then-popular Freudian free association, presenting a series of tenuously related scenes. is a seminal work of surrealist cinema.

==Synopsis==

A man sharpens a razor and tests it on his thumb. He gazes at the moon, which is about to be bisected by a thin cloud. A young woman stares straight ahead as he brings the razor near her eye. A cut occurs to the cloud passing in front of the moon, and then to a close-up of the razor slicing open her eye.

&quot;Eight years later&quot;, a young man bicycles down an urban street wearing a nun&#x27;s habit and carrying a striped box with a strap around his neck. The woman from the first scene hears him approaching and casts aside the book she was reading. She goes to the window and sees the young man lying on the curb, his bicycle on the ground. She emerges from the building and attempts to revive him.

Later, she assembles pieces of the young man&#x27;s clothing on a bed. The man then appears near the door, with ants emerging from a hole in his hand. An androgynous young woman pokes at a severed human hand in the street below the apartment while surrounded by a large crowd.

The crowd clears when a policeman places the hand in the box previously carried by the young man and gives it to the androgynous woman. She stands in the middle of the street clutching the box, where she is run over by a car. The man in the apartment seems to take sadistic pleasure in the accident, and he gestures at the woman in the room with him, leering and groping her breasts.

The woman resists him at first, but then allows him to molest her as he imagines her nude. The woman pushes him away as he drifts off and attempts to escape by running to the other side of the room. The man corners her as she reaches for a racquet in self-defense, but he suddenly picks up two ropes and drags two grand pianos containing dead donkeys, stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments, two pumpkins, and two priests who are attached to the ropes. The woman escapes the room. The man chases after her, but she traps his hand, which is infested with ants, in the door. She then finds him in the next room, dressed in his nun&#x27;s garb.

At &quot;around three in the morning&quot;, the man is roused from his rest by the door buzzer (represented by a cocktail shaker). The woman goes to answer the door and does not return. Another young man arrives in the apartment, gesturing angrily at the first. The second man forces the first to throw away his nun&#x27;s clothing and then makes him stand with his face to the wall.

&quot;Sixteen years ago&quot;, the second man admires art supplies and books on the table near the wall and forces the first man to hold two of the books as he stares at the wall. The first man eventually shoots the second when the books abruptly turn into revolvers. The second man, now in a meadow, dies while swiping at the back of a nude female figure which suddenly disappears into thin air. A group of men come and carry his corpse away.

The woman returns to the apartment and sees a death&#x27;s-head moth. The first man sneers at her as she retreats and wipes his mouth off his face with his hand; her armpit hair then attaches itself to where his mouth had been. She looks at him with disgust and leaves the apartment while sticking her tongue out. As she exits her apartment, the street is replaced by a coastal beach, where she meets a third man with whom she walks arm in arm. He shows her the time on his watch and they walk near the rocks, where they find the remnants of the first young man&#x27;s nun&#x27;s clothing and the box. They walk away clutching each other happily and making romantic gestures. &quot;In Spring&quot;, the couple are buried in sand up to their elbows, motionless.

==Production==
===Development===

The screenplay of the film is based on two dreams of co-creators Buñuel and Dali. The idea began when Buñuel was working as an assistant director for Jean Epstein in France. Buñuel told Dalí at a restaurant one day about a dream in which a cloud sliced the moon in half &quot;like a razor blade slicing through an eye&quot;. Dalí responded that he had dreamed about a hand crawling with ants. Excitedly, Buñuel declared: &quot;There&#x27;s the film, let&#x27;s go and make it.&quot; The two decided to write a script based on the concept of repressed emotions. The title of the film alludes to a Spanish idiom: &quot;the Andalusian dog howls –someone has died!” The screenplay was written in a few days.

According to Buñuel, they adhered to a simple rule: “Do not dwell on what required purely rational, psychological or cultural explanations. Open the way to the irrational. It was accepted only that which struck us, regardless of the meaning ... We did not have a single argument. A week of impeccable understanding. One, say, said: &#x27;A man drags double bass.&#x27; &#x27;No,&#x27; the other objected. And the objection was immediately accepted as completely justified. But when the proposal of one liked the other, it seemed to us magnificent, indisputable and immediately introduced into the script.”

In deliberate contrast to the approach taken by Jean Epstein and his peers, which was to never leave anything in their work to chance, with every aesthetic decision having a rational explanation and fitting clearly into the whole, Buñuel made clear throughout his writings that, between Dalí and himself, the only rule for the writing of the script was: &quot;No idea or image that might lend itself to a rational explanation of any kind would be accepted.&quot; He also stated: &quot;Nothing, in the film, symbolizes anything. The only method of investigation of the symbols would be, perhaps, psychoanalysis.&quot;

In his 1939 autobiography, Buñuel stated: &quot;In the film the aesthetics of Surrealism are combined to some of Freud&#x27;s discoveries. The film was totally in keeping with the basic principle of the school, which defined Surrealism as &#x27;Psychic Automatism&#x27;, unconscious, capable of returning to the mind its true functions, beyond any form of control by reason, morality or aesthetics.&quot;

===Filming===
The film was financed by Buñuel&#x27;s mother, and shot in Le Havre and at the Billancourt Studios in Paris over a period of ten days in March 1928. It is a black and white, 35 mm, silent film, with a running time of 17 minutes (although some sources state 24 minutes) and a physical length of 430 meters.

For many years, published and unpublished reports have circulated that Buñuel had used a dead goat&#x27;s eye, or that of a dead sheep, or of a dead donkey, or other animal, in the notorious eyeball-slicing scene. However, Buñuel claimed that he had used a dead calf&#x27;s eye. Through the use of intense lighting and bleaching of the calf&#x27;s skin Buñuel attempted to make the furred face of the animal appear as human skin.

During the bicycle scene, the woman seated on a chair and reading throws her book aside when she notices the fallen man. When the book lies open, it reveals a reproduction of a painting by Johannes Vermeer, an artist Dalí greatly admired and frequently referenced in his own works.

In Buñuel&#x27;s original script, the final shot was to feature the corpses of the man and woman &quot;consumed by swarms of flies&quot;. However, this was modified due to budget limitations, with the film ending with a still shot of the man and woman half-buried in the sand.

The movie contains several thematic references to Federico García Lorca and other writers of that time. The rotting donkeys are a reference to the popular children&#x27;s novel &quot;Platero y yo&quot; by Juan Ramón Jiménez, which Buñuel and Dalí both hated.

French filmmaker and anthropologist Jean Rouch has reported that after filming was complete, Buñuel and Dalí had run out of money, forcing Buñuel to edit the film personally in his kitchen without the aid of any technical equipment.

==Reception==
The first screening of took place at Studio des Ursulines. Notable attendees of the première included Pablo Picasso, Le Corbusier, Jean Cocteau, Christian Bérard and Georges Auric, in addition to the entirety of André Breton&#x27;s Surrealist group. The audience&#x27;s positive reception of the film amazed Buñuel, who was relieved that no violence ensued. Dalí, on the contrary, was reportedly disappointed, feeling that the audience&#x27;s reaction made the evening &quot;less exciting&quot;. Buñuel later claimed that prior to the show, he had put stones in his pockets &quot;to throw at the audience in case of disaster.&quot;.

Buñuel intended to shock and insult the intellectual bourgeoisie of his youth, later saying: &quot;Historically, this film represents a violent reaction against what at that time was called &#x27;avantgarde cine,&#x27; which was directed exclusively to the artistic sensibility and to the reason of the spectator.&quot; Against his hopes and expectations, the film was a huge success amongst the French elite, leading Buñuel to remark: &quot;What can I do about the people who adore all that is new, even when it goes against their deepest convictions, or about the insincere, corrupt press, and the inane herd that saw beauty or poetry in something which was basically no more than a desperate impassioned call for murder?&quot;

After its &quot;triumphant premiere&quot;, was bought by the owner of &quot;Studio-28&quot;. During its eight-month run, forty or fifty informers came to the police with a demand to ban it. This was the beginning of years of insults and threats that haunted Buñuel until his old age. A likely apocryphal account claimed that two miscarriages occurred while watching the film. Despite the criticism, however, the film was never banned.

Through their accomplishment with , Dalí and Buñuel became the first filmmakers to be officially welcomed into the ranks of the Surrealists by the movement&#x27;s leader André Breton, an event recalled by film historian Georges Sadoul: &quot;Breton had convoked the creators to our usual venue [the Café Radio] ... one summer&#x27;s evening. Dalí had the large eyes, grace, and timidity of a gazelle. To us, Buñuel, big and athletic, his black eyes protruding a little, seemed exactly like he always is in , meticulously honing the razor that will slice the open eye in two.&quot;

==Sequel==

Among the most enthusiastic viewers of the film were the wealthy couple Viscount Charles and Marie-Laure de Noailles, who commissioned Dalí and Buñuel to create a sequel, of around the same length, with sound, to be called &quot;La Bête Andalouse&quot;, in order to affirm its connection with &quot;Un Chien&quot;. Dalí stated that the theme of the new film was to parallel that of the first: &quot;to present the straight and pure &#x27;conduct&#x27; of someone who continues to pursue love despite wretched humanitarian ideals, patriotism and the other poor mechanisms of reality.&quot; This new film ultimately was released in 1930 under the title &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or.&quot;

The sequel was not a success with Parisian high society. First shown in November 1930, it was received extremely coldly. The next day, Charles de Noailles learned that he had been expelled from the Jockey Club de Paris. The de Noailles family quickly withdrew the film after it was banned by the Prefecture of Police of Paris.

==Soundtrack==
During the original 1929 screening in Paris, Buñuel selected music which he played live on a gramophone. Modern prints of the film feature a soundtrack consisting of excerpts from Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Liebestod&quot; from his opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and a recording of two Argentinian tangos, &quot;Tango Argentino&quot; and &quot;Recuerdos&quot; by the Vicente Alvarez &amp; Carlos Otero et son orchestre. They were first added to a print of the film in 1960 under Buñuel&#x27;s supervision.

==Influence==
Film scholar Ken Dancyger has argued that might be the genesis of the filmmaking style present in the modern music video. Roger Ebert called it an inspiration for low-budget independent films. &quot;Premiere&quot; ranked the opening scene at number ten on its list of &quot;The 25 Most Shocking Moments in Movie History&quot;.

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited as one of his favorite films.

The film was shown before every concert of David Bowie&#x27;s Isolar – 1976 Tour.

<text>Millinocket is a town in Penobscot County, Maine, United States. The population was 4,114 at the 2020 census.

Millinocket&#x27;s economy has historically been centered on forest products and recreation, but the paper company closed in 2008.

==History==
Millinocket is an Abenaki word that means land of many islands. For more than 10,000 years the area now known as Millinocket was inhabited by the Penobscot (their name for themselves is &quot;Pαnawάhpskewi)&quot;, an Indigenous people from the Northeastern Woodlands region whose name means the people of where the white rocks extend out.

The area was settled in 1829 by Betsy and Thomas Fowler and their family, who cleared land for a farm near Shad Pond. Other families followed in 1837. In 1846, Henry David Thoreau hired members of the Fowler family as guides on a trip to Mount Katahdin, which he wrote about in &quot;The Maine Woods&quot;. When the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad extended service to Houlton in 1894, the line ran through the area, opening it to development.

Charles W. Mullen, an engineering graduate from the University of Maine, proposed a hydroelectric dam on the Penobscot River. He recognized the falls as an ideal water power source to operate a large pulp and paper mill. Mullen contacted Garret Schenck, vice president of the International Paper mill at Rumford Falls and an expert in the industry, about building a pulp and paper mill near the dam. Schenck agreed, and set about obtaining the necessary financial backing.

After securing land rights, the chosen site was at the junction of the West Branch of the Penobscot River and Millinocket Stream, where it stands today. Things moved quickly, and on May 15, 1899, construction began on the new Great Northern Paper Company paper mill. As the location was not near existing towns, it became necessary to build one. Millinocket, meaning &quot;the land of many islands&quot; after all the islands in the Penobscot River, was incorporated on March 16, 1901.

Schenck contracted bonded labor, especially stonemasons from Italy. The term &quot;bonded&quot; in this case referred to the fact that the Italians owed for the passage to the U.S. and were in debt as soon as they set foot in this country. Italian masons were largely responsible for constructing the Millinocket mill. Immigrants from Poland, Finland, Lithuania, and Hungary, as well as French Canadians, also came to work on the mill. 

Throughout the 20th century, the community prospered. It developed a reputation as a small but successful rural town, mostly due to the paper industry, but also to its proximity to Katahdin, Maine&#x27;s tallest mountain, and Moosehead Lake, Maine&#x27;s largest lake.

In early 2003, Great Northern Paper announced it had filed for bankruptcy protection for its Millinocket and East Millinocket mills. Since then, the mill town has struggled to reshape its economy, while receiving significant help from the state government and local economic development efforts. Shortly after closing the mills in 2008, a Canadian corporation purchased the bankrupt paper mills in both Millinocket and East Millinocket. In addition to the traditional forest products industry, Millinocket has been growing a service economy, and has grown into a major four-season tourist attraction. The region is served by the Millinocket Municipal Airport, which sells both 100LL avgas and jet fuel.

<text>Major General Richard Jaquelin Marshall (16 June 1895 – 3 August 1973) was a senior officer in the United States Army.

He served in the 1st Division during World War I and became the Chief of Staff of United States Army Forces in the Pacific Theater of Operations by the end of World War II.

==Early life and education==
Marshall was born in Markham, Fauquier County, Virginia, on 16 June 1895, the son of Marion Lewis Marshall and his wife Rebecca Coke Marshall. His maternal grandfather, Richard Coke Marshall, was a colonel for the Confederacy in the Civil War, and great-grandson of the fourth Supreme Court Chief Justice, John Marshall. He was also a distant cousin of George Catlett Marshall. He attended public schools and Norfolk Academy in Norfolk from 1907 to 1911.

In 1911, he entered Virginia Military Institute, Lexington, Virginia. He graduated eighth in his class of 56 with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering in 1915, was an initiate of the Beta Commission of the Kappa Alpha Order, and went to work as an assistant chemist for Consolidated Electric Light and Power Co., in Baltimore, Maryland. He enlisted in the 4th Maryland Infantry, National Guard while employed in Baltimore. When the Guard was called into the service for the Mexican Border War, 18 June 1916, he was commissioned First Lieutenant and Battalion Adjutant. While at Eagle Pass, Texas, in August, 1916 he took examinations for the Regular Army and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the field artillery in November 1916. In March, 1917 he joined first Regular Army unit, 8th Field Artillery at Fort Bliss, Texas.

==World War I==
After the American entry into World War I in April, 1917, expansion of the Regular Army was accelerated and the 2nd Battalion of the 8th Field Artillery was sent to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, to form the 14th Field Artillery. In May Marshall was transferred to the 6th Field Artillery, one of the oldest Regular Army units, and which was then stationed at Douglas, Arizona, preparing for overseas service as one of the units forming the 1st Division. This was the first American division to be sent to serve with the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) on the Western Front, where it arrived in June.

Marshall saw combat in the Battle of Soissons, the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, and in the Meuse–Argonne offensive, where, on the morning of 1 November 1918, he was wounded by fragments of a German 105 mm shell. He was in army hospitals in France until March 1919, by which time the war had since come to an end, due to the Armistice with Germany. He had been promoted to captain and was a battery commander of B Battery, 6th Field Artillery.

==Between the wars==
Upon returning to the U.S. after the war, Marshall was assigned to the postwar Quartermaster Corps. He oversaw construction of Fitzsimons Hospital, Denver, Colorado. He was Quartermaster at Ft. Benning, Georgia 1924, then attended Quartermaster School in 1926, graduated in 1927 and was assigned to Ft. Monmouth, NJ.

In 1929 he was sent to the Philippines and assigned as Quartermaster of the Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays. He took up residence on Corregidor Island at Fort Mills where he had under his direction the start of construction of the West end of the Malinta Hill Tunnel. In World War II this same Tunnel became General MacArthur&#x27;s Command Post on Corregidor.

Marshall returned to the U.S. in 1932, attending Command and Staff School at Ft. Leavenworth, Ks, followed by the Army Industrial College, Washington, D.C. He graduated in 1935 and after summer maneuvers with the First Army entered the Army War College, graduating 1936. He was then placed in charge of the Water Transportation Branch.

He married Nell B. Mutter. They had two children, Richard J. Marshall, Jr., who died on 2 March 1943 in World War II, and Harriette Marshall Olsen, who married John E. Olson, who survived the Bataan Death March. After Nell died in 1934, he married Isabel Crum in Montgomery, Alabama on 28 December 1935. From the marriage, he gained a stepdaughter, Dorothy, and step son, Lieutenant Kenneth Roscoe Lummus, who died on 28 March 1943.

In 1939, upon the request of General Douglas MacArthur, Marshall was assigned to duty again in the Philippines. A vacancy had occurred through the return of Col. Dwight D. Eisenhower to duty in the U.S. The officers on this duty were assisting Gen. MacArthur in advising the Philippine Commonwealth Government in forming and training an army for the defense of the Islands after Independence which was to be granted in 1946. He was on this duty in July 1941 when Gen. MacArthur was recalled to active duty. He was detailed to General Staff with troops and Deputy Chief of his Command, the United States Army Forces in the Far East. In October, 1941 he was promoted to temporary Colonel.

==World War II==
After Pearl Harbor, Marshall was promoted to brigadier general and remained as Deputy Chief of Staff. He was left in charge of the old Command Post at #1 Victoria in Manila when General MacArthur went to Corregidor to establish his Command Post on December 24, 1941. He remained there until directed to bring the balance of the Staff to Corregidor, January 1, 1942. As the Japanese invasion of the Philippines advanced, the fall of Corregidor appeared imminent. As a result, on the night of March 11, 1942 MacAurthur, his family, and his staff, including Marshall, evacuated under cover of night in four PT boats of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three, with the lead boat commanded by Lieutenant John D. Bulkeley. After an open ocean voyage of several hundred miles they reached Mindanao, then flew to Darwin, Australia, reaching there on March 17, 1942.

From Darwin, MacArthur chose to travel south by train because of his wife&#x27;s fear of flying. As Quartermaster, Marshall was sent ahead to assess troop strength and resources for the potential immediate return to the Philippines. In a historic moment, reenacted in the movie, &quot;MacArthur&quot;, Marshall met MacArthur&#x27;s train upon arrival in Adelaide and broke the news to him that U.S. forces in the Pacific would not be sufficient to support any sort of immediate effort to recapture the Philippines. This made clear to MacArthur the war would be more than just a few months in duration.

After a few weeks in Australia the Allied arrangements for a Southwest Pacific Command were completed and Marshall was detailed as MacArthur&#x27;s Deputy Chief of Staff. In July the US Army Service of Supply, SWPA succeeded the former command for the US Army Forces in Australia and he became Commanding General, with promotion to Major General.

In early 1942 Marshall was given additional duty as Deputy Chief of Staff of USAFFE (U.S. Armed Forces Far East) when it was used to provide a US Army agency for MacArthur to exercise command over US Army troops in SWPA (South West Pacific Army). Increase in size of SWPA Command rapidly increased the administrative problems of MacArthur&#x27;s Headquarters. In November, 1944, he was detailed as MacArthur&#x27;s Chief of Staff, USAFFE and, when MacArthur became commander of AFPAC (U.S. Army Forces in the Pacific), Marshall became Deputy Chief of Staff.

In 1945, with entry into Japan after the surrender, Marshall became Deputy Chief of Staff of SCAP (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers). On October 10 he was ordered to Headquarters in Tokyo to take over as the Chief of Staff.

On September 2, 1945, he accompanied MacArthur on board the for the signing of the surrender treaty with the Japanese delegation.

==Post-World War II==
In May 1946 Marshall was ordered to temporary duty in the Office of the Chief of Staff, US Army, Washington, D.C., in order that he be available to become Superintendent of the Virginia Military Institute.

He retired from the Army on Nov 30, 1946 and became the 7th Superintendent of VMI until he resigned in June 1952. While at VMI his neighbor, Washington and Lee University, conferred upon him the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LL D). President Harry S. Truman appointed him to serve as Deputy Chief of the Bell Mission to make an economic survey of the Philippines. He received the rank of Minister without portfolio for that appointment.

==Military record and death==
During his Army career, Marshall received the Silver Star during World War I, and the Distinguished Service Cross and Army Distinguished Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters from the three command and staff positions that he held in World War II. He was made an Officer of the Legion of Honour of France, and a Grand Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau with Crossed Swords (Netherlands), and received the Distinguished Service Star of the Philippines with an oak leaf cluster.

During his last year at VMI, the State of Virginia promoted him to Lieutenant General in the Virginia Militia (Unorganized). Following the disruptions of World War II he got the VMI Foundation off the ground with an increase in funds from $100,000 to $600,000. General Marshall, a 1915 graduate, expanded the Corps of Cadets from 300 to 950 during the six years of his administration, both academic and military offerings were expanded and the faculty was enlarged to meet the demands of the growing Cadet Corps, growth made possible by the planning and completion during his administration of the new cadet barracks.

He retired in 1952 after suffering a stroke and moved to Florida. He died at Fort Lauderdale on 3 August 1973, and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington County, Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, Marine Corps Brigadier General St. Julien R. Marshall, was subsequently buried next to him in 1989.

<text>Hugh John &quot;Pat&quot; Casey CBE (7 June 1898 – 30 August 1981) was a major general in the United States Army. A 1918 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Casey served in Germany during the Occupation of the Rhineland. He later returned to Germany to attend the &quot;Technische Hochschule&quot; in Berlin, earning a Doctor of Engineering degree.

As an engineer, Casey prepared a voluminous report on flood control for the Pittsburgh District. He was involved with the design and construction of the Deadman Island Lock and Dam on the Ohio River, and was chief of the Engineering Division at the Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project, a New Deal public works project. He went to the Philippines in 1937 to advise the government there on hydropower and flood control. In the early part of World War II, he became involved with the enormous wartime construction program. Perhaps his most notable and lasting achievement was his involvement with the design of The Pentagon, the largest office building in the world.

Casey served as General of the Army Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s chief engineer during the Battle of Bataan, in the jungles and mountains of New Guinea and the Philippines, and during the occupation of Japan. In the Battle of Leyte, he commanded the Army Support Command (ASCOM), which was responsible for all construction and logistics activities in the forward area. He hoped to become Chief of Engineers, but President Harry S. Truman passed him over. Later, Casey worked for Schenley Industries from 1951 until his retirement in 1965, and was chairman of the New York City Transit Authority from 1953 to 1955.

==Early life==
Hugh John Casey was born in Brooklyn, New York on 7 June 1898, the son of John J. Casey, a plumbing and heating contractor, and Margaret L. Casey. John&#x27;s grandparents were immigrants from Ireland and England. His grandfather served on the Union side in the American Civil War and was killed in the Battle of Shiloh. Margaret&#x27;s parents were Irish immigrants who settled in Pennsylvania.

Hugh Casey was educated at Manual Training High School from 1910 to 1914, graduating at the age of 15. He won a New York State scholarship and entered Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, where he studied civil engineering. After a year there, he took a competitive examination for the U.S. Military Academy at West Point held by Congressman Daniel J. Griffin, the chairman of the House Committee on Military Affairs, ranking first out of 62 applicants for the appointment. To enter, Casey claimed to be slightly older, adopting his brother&#x27;s 7 June birthday.

Casey entered West Point in 1915, where his best friend and roommate was Lucius D. Clay. At West Point, Casey played football as a halfback, substituting for Elmer Oliphant. One of Casey&#x27;s duties was tutoring Oliphant in mathematics. Casey decided that winning games was more important than playing, and he helped keep Oliphant proficient at math. Unlike most appointees to West Point, a grateful Casey wrote frequently to Griffin about his progress and sent him football tickets. When Casey&#x27;s younger brother Martin Charles Casey wanted to enter West Point, Griffin directly appointed him to the class of 1920 without having to pass the examination. Martin served with the coastal artillery for eleven years before being medically discharged due to migraine headaches on 30 November 1931. Martin later graduated from Stanford Law School and became a successful lawyer. Both brothers acquired the nickname &quot;Pat&quot; at West Point.

==World War I==
Because of the United States&#x27; entry into World War I, Casey&#x27;s class graduated early on 12 June 1918. Casey was ranked third in the class and was commissioned as a captain in the United States Army Corps of Engineers. He was stationed at Camp A. A. Humphreys, Virginia, first as an instructor and then starting in September 1918 as a company commander with the 219th Engineers, part of the 19th Division. The 219th Engineers moved to Camp Dodge, Iowa in November 1918. Casey returned to the Engineer School at Camp Humphreys as a student in September 1919.

He served with the US Occupation forces in the Rhineland from June 1920 to May 1922. While there, Casey improved on his high school German to become fluent enough in the language to write his doctoral thesis in the language. He also married Dorothy Ruth Miller, the daughter of Colonel R. B. Miller, the chief surgeon of the American forces stationed in Koblenz, on 22 May 1922. On their honeymoon they traveled through south Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The couple had three children: two sons, Hugh Boyd and Keith Miles, and a daughter, Patricia.

==Between the wars==
From 1922 to 1926, Casey was the officer in charge of the Engineer Unit of the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, reverting to his substantive rank of first lieutenant on 27 November 1922. He again returned to Camp Humpreys in 1926 to attend the Company Officers Course. In 1927, Casey received his first civil works assignment, as assistant District Engineer at the Pittsburgh District. Casey took over the task of preparing a voluminous report on flood control. The Corps of Engineers was criticized by the Pittsburgh Flood Control Commission for over-engineering, in planning for a &quot;flood that had never happened and never would happen&quot;, and the report was shelved. However, in 1936 the flood did happen. The report was then dusted off and its recommendations were adopted. The Flood Control Act of 1936 assigned responsibility for flood control to the Corps of Engineers and other Federal agencies. Casey was also responsible for construction at Deadman Island Lock and Dam (now called the Dashields Locks and Dam) on the Ohio River.

In September 1929 Casey was assigned to the Rivers and Harbors Section of the Office of the Chief of Engineers in Washington, DC. This job involved reviewing the project studies, plans and specifications of all river and harbor projects throughout the United States, including flood control and hydroelectric power projects. He also had responsibility for correspondence with U.S. senators and congressmen. During this time he co-designed and patented the Kingman-Casey Floating Mooring Bit for navigation locks. He was promoted to the substantive rank of captain on 1 May 1933.

Casey won a John R. Freeman fellowship from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1933 to study hydraulics and civil engineering in Germany. For the next two years, he attended the &quot;Technische Hochschule&quot; in Berlin, earning a Doctorate in Engineering. His thesis, written in German, was on &quot;Geschieb Bewegung&quot;, the bedload movement in streams. Returning to the United States in June 1935, Casey was posted to Eastport, Maine as chief of the Engineering Division at the Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project, a New Deal public works project. There, he established a concrete testing laboratory under Charles E. Wuerpel which is now part of the Structures Laboratory at the Waterways Experiment Station at Vicksburg, Mississippi. Due to political forces, the project came to nothing and was allowed to die. After the Passamaquoddy project fell through, Casey served with the Boston Engineer District on flood control surveys of the Connecticut River Valley.

Along with Lucius Clay, Casey was sent to the Philippines in 1937 to advise the government there on hydropower and flood control. They worked with Meralco and other power companies in the Philippines, and conducted a series of surveys, including a detailed one of the Agno River. After Clay returned to the United States, Casey developed plans for the Caliraya Dam, a hydroelectric project with an estimated cost of $5 million. Along with Lieutenant Colonel Dwight D. Eisenhower, the chief of staff to Major General Douglas MacArthur, the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines, and Mr. Rodriquez of the National Power Corporation, Casey presented the project to President Manuel Quezon, who approved it. After over twenty years as a company grade officer, Casey was promoted to major on 1 February 1940.

==World War II==
===Construction Division===

Casey returned to Washington, D.C. in October 1940 to become chief of the Design and Engineering Section in the Construction Division of the Office of the Quartermaster General, under Brigadier General Brehon B. Somervell. An enormous construction program was underway to meet the needs of World War II. Working with a staff that included George Bergstrom, a former president of the American Institute of Architects, Casey set about revising the standard designs for barracks. A number of new features were added to improve comfort, safety, and durability. Substitutions were made for scarce materials. It was discovered that the standard 63-man barracks was now too small. Of the 81 companies in the new triangular division, 51 fitted more easily into 74-man barracks. By slightly increasing the barracks size, substantial savings were made by reducing the overall number of buildings that needed to be constructed, the size of the cantonment areas required, and the length of required roads and utility lines. Casey was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 8 April 1941.

On the afternoon of Thursday, 17 July 1941, Somervell summoned Casey and Bergstrom and gave them a new special project: the design of an enormous office complex to house the War Department&#x27;s 40,000-person staff together in one building. Somervell gave them until 09:00 on Monday morning to design the building, which he envisaged as a modern, four-story structure with no elevators, on the site of the old Washington Hoover Airport. This would ultimately become The Pentagon, the largest office building in the world. Over that &quot;very busy weekend&quot;, Casey, Bergstrom and their staff roughed out the design for a four-story, five-sided structure with a floor area of —twice that of the Empire State Building. The estimated cost was $35 million. President Roosevelt subsequently moved the site of the building, over Somervell&#x27;s objections, away from Arlington National Cemetery.

===Southwest Pacific===
In September 1941, General Douglas MacArthur requested Casey&#x27;s services as his chief engineer. Casey arrived in Manila in October, shortly before the outbreak of war between the United States and Japan. He acquired construction equipment from the National Power Corporation that was being used on the Caliraya project. Casey supervised demolitions as MacArthur&#x27;s troops retreated to Bataan, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Unlike the rest of MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters, Casey, who was promoted to colonel on 19 December 1941 and brigadier general on 25 January 1942, did not relocate to Corregidor but remained on Bataan with a small staff of five officers. However, he joined MacArthur and sixteen other members of his staff in their escape from Corregidor by PT boat in March 1942. For his service in the 1942 campaign in the Philippines, he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal.
In Australia, Casey became Chief Engineer at MacArthur&#x27;s General Headquarters (GHQ), Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA). He faced enormous engineering challenges. Most of New Guinea consisted of mountains and jungle, with very few airstrips, ports or roads. All of these had to be developed to support operations. To provide additional expertise in construction, Casey had Leif Sverdrup assigned to his staff as chief of the Construction Section, with the rank of colonel. As U.S. Army engineers were few, Casey worked closely with his Australian Army counterpart at General Sir Thomas Blamey&#x27;s Allied Land Forces headquarters, Major General Clive Steele. Construction activities in Australia were also undertaken by civilians of the Allied Works Council. Casey attempted to coordinate the activities of the various agencies. He had to fend off attempts by the U.S. Army Air Forces to gain control of his aviation engineer battalions. The Royal Australian Air Force organized its own airbase construction squadrons and only with difficulty was Casey able to control their activities.

Casey&#x27;s initial need was for engineer units to accomplish the daunting construction program, but soon stocks of engineer supplies and equipment began to run low. This was exacerbated by incoming units arriving without their equipment, or with it stowed on numerous ships, which often arrived at various ports in a theater where ports were hundred or thousands of miles apart. Critical shortages developed of tractors, graders, concrete mixers and welding equipment. In the absence of a proper stock control system, an overall coordinating agency, and adequate numbers of engineer depot units, the allocation and distribution of the meager supplies on hand were difficult tasks. The worst problem was spare parts. Equipment was operated around the clock under harsh conditions and soon wore out or broke. A large proportion of equipment became unserviceable for lack of spare parts. Requisitions sent to the United States took months to arrive, so recourse was made to the limited sources of supply in Australia.
In September 1942, MacArthur decided to outflank Japanese troops on the Kokoda Trail by sending an American regimental combat team over the Owen Stanley Range. Two alternate means of crossing the mountains seemed possible. One, the Kapa Kapa Trail was known to climb to elevations above and present formidable obstacles. Casey and Sverdrup took charge of investigating the Abau Trail. They reached Abau on 18 September. Casey explored the harbor, taking depth soundings from a native canoe. Sverdrup set out for Jaure with a party of one American, two Australians from the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit, ten native police from the Royal Papuan Constabulary and 26 native carriers. After eight days on the trail, scaling heights of , Sverdrup concluded that it would not be practical for troops to traverse the route and turned back. Meanwhile, Casey had concluded that the harbor was too shallow even for lighters. However, the trip was not a total loss, for Sverdrup had sighted a plateau north of the Owen Stanley Range suitable for airstrips, allowing troops to be flown across the Owen Stanley Range. Casey was awarded the Silver Star.

In New Guinea, logistics and construction activities were coordinated by task force engineer staffs. These were often hastily assembled and had not always been able to meet the demands imposed by base development in such a challenging theater of operations. The scale of operations in the Philippines was much greater, so for this purpose the Army Service Command (ASCOM) was formed in Brisbane on 23 July 1944. Casey was appointed to command ASCOM. In his absence, Sverdrup became MacArthur&#x27;s chief engineer. Although part of USASOS, ASCOM operated under the control of Sixth Army, moving as far forward as combat operations allowed, developed new bases, and operated them until USASOS was ready to take over, at which point the units under ASCOM simply reverted to USASOS, allowing a seamless transfer of command. For the Battle of Leyte Casey&#x27;s ASCOM had 43,000 men, of whom 21,000 were engineers.

Casey and some members of his staff came ashore on A-Day; the advance echelon of his ASCOM headquarters arrived two days later. Work began immediately on the airfield at Tacloban, and commenced on airfields in central Leyte soon after they were captured. Heavy seasonal rains thwarted attempts to develop the airbases in central Leyte and it was decided to abandon their development and construct a new airbase on the coast at a site occupied by Sixth Army headquarters. The need to get aircraft based on Leyte to stop the Japanese from reinforcing the island was so pressing that Lieutenant General Walter Krueger agreed to move his headquarters.

Casey had intended to come ashore on the first day of the landing at Lingayen Gulf in January 1945 but was delayed a day because the destroyer he was traveling on had to escort a crippled transport. Despite enormous difficulties ASCOM was able to finish numerous projects on time and some ahead of schedule. On 13 February 1945, ASCOM was transferred to USASOS and redesignated the Luzon Base Section (LUBSEC). Casey then resumed his old post, now renamed Chief Engineer, US Army Forces Pacific. For his services as commander of ASCOM, he was awarded the Legion of Merit. He was subsequently awarded a bronze oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal for his services as Chief Engineer, US Army Forces Pacific.

Casey hoped to become Chief of Engineers when Lieutenant General Raymond A. Wheeler retired in 1948, but President Harry S. Truman passed him over in favor of the Missouri River Division Engineer, Major General Lewis A. Pick. Instead, Casey remained in Japan as MacArthur&#x27;s Chief Engineer until Casey&#x27;s retirement on 31 December 1949. He edited &quot;Engineers of the Southwest Pacific&quot;, a seven-volume series about their wartime service. He received a number of foreign awards for his service, including the Distinguished Service Star from the Philippines, the Commander of the Order of the British Empire from Australia, the Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau from the Netherlands, and the Officer of Légion d&#x27;honneur from France.

==Later life==
Casey was Chairman of the New York City Transit Authority from 1953 to 1955, and served in various positions with Schenley Industries from 1951 until his retirement in 1965. He was a member of a number of professional societies, and civic organizations. He died of a heart attack on 30 August 1981 at the Veterans Administration Hospital at White River Junction, Vermont, survived by his wife Dorothy and his son Keith. His other son, Hugh, had been killed in an air crash during the Korean War. Father and son were buried adjacent to each other in Arlington National Cemetery. In August 1982, a new building at the Humphreys Engineer Center at Fort Belvoir was dedicated in his honor by Dorothy and the Chief of Engineers, Lieutenant General Joseph K. Bratton.

<doc id="161352" wikidata="Q316543" url="?curid=161352" title="Louis II, Prince of Monaco">
<text>Louis II (Louis Honoré Charles Antoine Grimaldi; 12 July 1870 – 9 May 1949) was Prince of Monaco from 26 June 1922 to 9 May 1949.

==Early years==
Born in Baden-Baden, Louis II was the only child of Albert I, Prince of Monaco (1848–1922), and Lady Mary Victoria Douglas-Hamilton (1850–1922). His mother was a daughter of William Hamilton, 11th Duke of Hamilton and Princess Marie Amelie of Baden.

Louis was born within a year of his parents&#x27; marriage, but his mother, a strong-willed 19-year-old, disliked Monaco and was unhappy with her husband. She left the country permanently shortly after the birth, and the couple&#x27;s marriage was annulled in 1880. Louis was raised in Germany by his mother and stepfather, Count (later Prince) Tassilo Festetics von Tolna, along with his eldest half-sister Maria-Mathilde (later grandmother of Princess Ira von Fürstenberg); he did not see his father until age 11 when he was obliged to return to Monaco to be trained for his future princely duties.

Louis&#x27;s father, Prince Albert I, was a dominating personality who had made Monaco a centre of cultural activity and whose intellectual achievements were recognized around the world. Unhappy to be living with his cold and distant father, Louis went to France as soon as he was old enough to enroll in Saint-Cyr, the French national military college. Four years later, after graduating, he was attached to the French Foreign Legion and then served with a regiment of Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique (African Light Horse) in Algeria.

Before being stationed in Algeria, he met Marie Juliette Louvet (1867–1930), a cabaret singer, on a short official visit to Paris. Juliette was already the mother of two children, Georges and Marguerite, by her former husband, French &quot;girlie&quot; photographer Achille Delmaet (1860–1914). Reportedly, Prince Louis fell deeply in love but, because of her ignominious station in life, his father would not permit the marriage. It has been asserted that Louis ignored his father and married Juliette in 1897: there is, however, no evidence for this allegation. They had an out-of-wedlock daughter, Charlotte Louise Juliette, born on 30 September 1898 in Constantine, Algeria. There is no mention of Louvet in the authorized biography of her grandson, Prince Rainier III, who is Monegasque by nationality but whose ancestors include people of French, Mexican, Italian, German, Scottish, and English nationality.

Louis served in the French Army for four years from 1895 to 1899, reaching the rank of lieutenant. He was awarded the médaille coloniale (Colonial Medal) and the Cross of the Legion of Honor. At the conclusion of his military service, he returned to Monaco, leaving behind his mistress and daughter. At the outbreak of World War I, he re-enlisted in the French Army as a volunteer, serving as a staff officer under General Franchet d’Espèrey. Louis was made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor and eventually became a brigadier general.

==Solution to succession aspects in 1911–18==
A political crisis loomed for the Prince because without any other heir, the throne of Monaco would pass to his first cousin Wilhelm, the 2nd Duke of Urach, a German nobleman who was a son of Prince Albert&#x27;s aunt, Princess Florestine of Monaco. To ensure this did not happen, in 1911 a law was passed recognizing his out-of-wedlock daughter, Charlotte, as Louis&#x27;s acknowledged heir, and making her part of the princely family. This law was later held to be invalid, and thus another law was passed in 1918 modifying the statutes to allow the adoption of an heir with succession rights. Charlotte was formally adopted by Louis in 1919 and became Charlotte Louise Juliette Grimaldi, Princess of Monaco and Duchess of Valentinois.

Wilhelm, 2nd Duke of Urach, thus placed further back in the line of succession to the throne of Monaco, was chosen as King of Lithuania for a few months in 1918, being known as Mindaugas II. It is a moot point whether he could be the sovereign of two European countries simultaneously, had he in fact succeeded to the throne of Monaco, but he had several sons. He renounced his claim to the principality in 1924, passing it to other French cousins that were also descended from the Grimaldi family, the counts of Chabrillan.

On 17 July 1918, largely because of the von Urach potential claim, France and Monaco signed a brief but far-reaching treaty requiring prior French approval of all future Monégasque princes. Article 2 specified: &quot;Measures concerning the international relations of the Principality shall always be the subject of prior consultations between the Government of the Principality and the French Government. The same shall apply to measures concerning directly or indirectly the exercise of a regency or succession to the throne, which shall, whether by marriage or adoption or otherwise, pass only to a person who is of French or Monégasque nationality and is approved by the French Government.&quot; Under Article 3, Prince Albert agreed &quot;...for himself and his successors the commitment assumed towards the French Government not to alienate the Principality, in whole or in part, in favour of any Power other than France.&quot;

==Reign==

On 26 June 1922, Prince Albert I died in Paris. Louis Grimaldi ascended to the throne as Louis II, Prince of Monaco. While his reign never achieved the grandeur of his father, Louis II left an indelible imprint on the principality. In 1924 the Monaco Football Club was formed and in 1929, the first Grand Prix of Monaco automobile race was held, won by William Grover-Williams, driving a Bugatti painted in what would become the famous British racing green color. He collected artefacts belonging to Napoleon I which are now assembled and displayed in the Napoleon Museum attached to the Prince&#x27;s Palace in Monte Carlo.

Particularly in the earlier years of Louis&#x27;s reign, he acquired the reputation for administrative probity: he obtained the departure of Camille Blanc who had long managed Monte Carlo Casino yet who faced increasing questions regarding his administration of the casino&#x27;s affairs.

In 1931 revolutionaries planned to depose Louis II and replace him with Prince Pierre, Duke of Valentinois, his son-in-law. This was provoked by agitation from the administrator of the Monte Carlo Casino, René Léon, and planned to also dismantle the influence of the casino over the principality. The date was set for 15 April of that year but never materialised for unknown reasons.

In 1931, the prestige of Monaco&#x27;s cultural life received a boost when René Blum was hired to form the Ballet de l&#x27;Opéra à Monte-Carlo. Just before the outbreak of World War II in 1939, a modern large football stadium was built where the Universiade were staged at the newly named &quot;Stade Prince Louis II&quot;.

While Louis&#x27;s sympathies were strongly pro-French, he supported the Vichy France government of his old army colleague, Marshal Pétain. Nonetheless, his principality was beset with domestic conflict partly as a result of Louis&#x27;s indecisiveness, partly due to his questionable financial links with the Nazi regime, and also because the majority of the population was of Italian descent and supported the fascist regime of Italy&#x27;s Benito Mussolini. Throughout the war, Louis&#x27;s vacillation caused an enormous rift with his grandson Rainier (the heir-presumptive to the throne after 1944), who strongly supported the Allies.

In 1942, the Italian Army invaded and occupied Monaco. Shortly thereafter, following Mussolini&#x27;s overthrow in Italy, Nazi Germany occupied Monaco. On the night of August 27, 1942, Monaco authorities rounded up 90 Jewish residents and handed them over to the Nazis; all but nine were murdered in the Holocaust. Among them was René Blum, founder of the Opera, who was murdered in the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz.

For a number of months in 1944, communists participated in the liberation administration of Monaco.

Following the liberation of Monaco by the Allied forces, the 75-year-old Prince Louis did little for his principality and it began to fall into severe neglect. By 1946, he was spending most of his time in Paris. On 24–27 July of that year, he married in Monaco for the first time. His wife was Ghislaine Dommanget (13 October 1900 – 30 April 1991) a French film actress and former wife of actor André Brulé. Absent from Monaco during most of the final years of his reign, he and his wife lived at Marchais, their family estate in northern France.

==Death and succession==
Prince Louis II died in 1949 in the Prince&#x27;s Palace and is buried at the Saint Nicholas Cathedral in Monte Carlo, Monaco. His daughter, Charlotte, had ceded her succession rights to her son, Rainier, in 1944, at which time he became hereditary prince. Thus, when Louis II died five years later, he was succeeded by his grandson, Rainier III.

<text>Shahrbaraz (also spelled Shahrvaraz or Shahrwaraz; New Persian: ), was shah (king) of the Sasanian Empire from 27 April 630 to 9 June 630. He usurped the throne from Ardashir III, and was killed by Iranian nobles after forty days. Before usurping the Sasanian throne he was a &quot;spahbed&quot; (general) under Khosrow II (590–628). He is furthermore noted for his important role during the climactic Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, and the events that followed afterwards.

== Name ==
&#x27; is actually a title, literally meaning &quot;the Boar of the Empire&quot;, attesting to his dexterity in military command and his warlike personality, as the boar was the animal associated with the Zoroastrian Izad Vahram, the epitome of victory. &quot;Shahrwarāz&quot; (Inscriptional Pahlavi: štlwlʾc) is a Middle Persian word, with &quot;shahr&quot; meaning &quot;country&quot; and &quot;warāz&quot; meaning &quot;boar&quot;. This word is rendered as &quot;Shahrbarāz&quot; () in New Persian and as &quot;Sarvaros&quot; (Greek: ; Latin: &#x27;) in Byzantine sources. Ferdowsi has used the shortened form &quot;Gurāz&quot; (, literally &quot;boar&quot;), which is from Middle Persian &quot;warāz&quot;.

According to al-Tabari, his real name was &quot;Farrukhān&quot; (). The name is corrupted as &quot;Khoream&quot; in Armenian sources and &quot;Farāyīn&quot; () in Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnama&quot;. Ferdowsi has split Shahrbaraz&#x27;s character into two: Farayin who was the usurper, and Shahran-Guraz who supported Bahram Chobin&#x27;s rebellion.

Armenian sources also use the title &quot;Razmyozan&quot; (also spelled &quot;Razmiozan&quot;, &quot;Erazmiozan&quot;, &quot;Razmayuzan&quot;). The title is also mentioned as &quot;Rasmiozdan&quot;, &quot;Rasmiozan&quot; (Georgian), &quot;rsmysa&quot; (, reading uncertain), &quot;Rōmēzān&quot;, &quot;Rūmīzān&quot;, &quot;Rumbūzān&quot; (al-Tabari, &quot;Tarikh&quot;).

== Early life ==
Shahrbaraz belonged to the House of Mihran, one of the Seven Parthian clans; he was the son of a certain Ardashir. During Shahrbaraz&#x27;s later life, he joined the Sasanian army, where he rose to high offices, and was appointed as &quot;spahbed&quot; of Nēmrōz. He was married to the sister of the Sasanian king Khosrow II, Mirhran, with whom Shahrbaraz had one boy named Shapur-i Shahrvaraz. Shahrbaraz also had another son named Niketas the Persian, who may be from the same woman or from another.

== War against the Byzantine Empire ==

Shahrbaraz is first mentioned when Khosrow II started the last and most devastating of the Byzantine–Sasanian wars, which lasted 26 years. Khosrow II, along with Shahrbaraz and his other best generals, conquered Dara and Edessa in 604, and in the north, the Byzantines were driven back to the old, pre-591 frontier before Khosrow II gave them most of Sasanian Armenia, parts of Mesopotamia and western half of the Kingdom of Iberia. After reconquering lost territory, Khosrow II withdrew from the battlefield and handed military operations to his best generals. Shahrbaraz was one of them. In 610, Heraclius, an Armenian of probable Arsacid descent, revolted against the Byzantine Emperor Phocas and killed him, crowning himself as Emperor of the Byzantine Empire. After becoming Byzantine Emperor, he prepared a major counter-attack against the Sasanians outside Antioch in 613, but was decisively defeated by Shahrbaraz, who inflicted heavy losses on the Byzantine army and then captured the city, giving the Sasanians naval access to the Mediterranean Sea.

After the Byzantine defeat outside Antioch, Heraclius and his brother Theodore, along with General Nicetas, combined their armies in Syria, but were defeated by Shahrbaraz and his forces who besieged Damascus and captured it along with a large number of Byzantine troops as prisoners. Furthermore, Shahrbaraz also defeated a Byzantine army near Adhri&#x27;at. One of the most important events during his career was when he led the Sasanian army towards Palaestina, and after a bloody siege captured Jerusalem, a city sacred to the Christians. After his conquest of Jerusalem the Holy Cross was carried away in triumph. In 618, Shahrbaraz was ordered by Khosrow II to invade Egypt, and by 619, Alexandria, the capital of Byzantine Egypt, was in Sasanian hands.

After the fall of Alexandria, Shahrbaraz and his forces extended Sasanian rule southwards along the Nile. By 621, the province was securely in Sasanian hands, and a certain Sahralanyozan was appointed as its governor. In 622, Heraclius counter-attacked against the Sasanian Empire in Anatolia. Shahrbaraz was sent over there to deal with him, but was eventually defeated by him.

After Heraclius&#x27; victory, he marched towards Caucasian Albania and wintered there. Shahrbaraz, along with Shahin and Shahraplakan were later sent by the orders of Khosrow II to trap the forces of Heraclius. Shahin managed to rout the Byzantine army. Due to jealousy between the Sasanian commanders, Shahrbaraz hurried with his army to take part in the glory of the victory. Heraclius met them at Tigranakert and routed the forces of Shahraplakan and Shahin one after the other. After this victory, Heraclius crossed the Araxes and camped in the plains on the other side. Shahin, with the remnants of both his and Shahraplakan&#x27;s armies joined Shahrbaraz in the pursuit of Heraclius, but marshes slowed them down. At Aliovit, Shahrbaraz split his forces, sending some 6,000 troops to ambush Heraclius while the remainder of the troops stayed at Aliovit. Heraclius launched a surprise night attack on the Sasanian main camp in February 625, destroying it. Shahrbaraz only barely escaped, naked and alone, having lost his harem, baggage, and men.

Heraclius spent the rest of winter to the north of Lake Van. In 625, his forces attempted to push back towards the Euphrates. In a mere seven days, he bypassed Mount Ararat and the 200 miles along the Arsanias River to capture Amida and Martyropolis, important fortresses on the upper Tigris. Heraclius then carried on towards the Euphrates, pursued by Shahrbaraz. According to Arab sources, he was stopped at the Satidama or Batman Su River and defeated; Byzantine sources, however, do not mention this incident. Another minor skirmish between Heraclius and Shahrbaraz took place at the Sarus river near Adana. Shahrbaraz stationed his forces across the river from the Byzantines. A bridge spanned the river, and the Byzantines immediately charged across. Shahrbaraz feigned retreat to lead the Byzantines into an ambush, and the vanguard of Heraclius&#x27; army was destroyed within minutes. The Sasanians, however, had neglected to cover the bridge, and Heraclius charged across with the rearguard, unafraid of the arrows that the Sasanians fired, turning the tide of battle against the Sasanians. Shahrbaraz expressed his admiration at Heraclius to a renegade Greek: &quot;See your Emperor! He fears these arrows and spears no more than would an anvil!&quot; The Battle of Sarus was a successful retreat for the Byzantines that panegyrists magnified. In the aftermath of the battle, the Byzantine army wintered at Trebizond.

== Siege of Constantinople ==

Shahrbaraz, along with a smaller army, later managed to slip through Heraclius&#x27; flanks and bee-lined for Chalcedon, the Sasanian base across the Bosphorus from Constantinople. Khosrow II coordinated with the Khagan of the Avars so as to launch a coordinated attack on Constantinople from both European and Asiatic sides. The army of Shahrbaraz stationed themselves at Chalcedon, while the Avars placed themselves on the European side of Constantinople and destroyed the Aqueduct of Valens. Because of the Byzantine navy&#x27;s control of the Bosphorus strait, however, the Sasanians could not send troops to the European side to aid their ally. This reduced the effectiveness of the siege, because the Sasanians were experts in siege warfare. Furthermore, the Sasanians and Avars had difficulties communicating across the guarded Bosphorus—though undoubtedly, there was some communication between the two forces.

On 7 August, a fleet of Sasanian rafts ferrying troops across the Bosphorus was surrounded and destroyed by Byzantine ships. The Slavs under the Avars attempted to attack the sea walls from across the Golden Horn, while the main Avar host attacked the land walls. Patrician Bonus&#x27; galleys rammed and destroyed the Slavic boats; the Avar land assault from 6 to 7 August also failed. With the news that Theodore had decisively triumphed over Shahin (supposedly leading Shahin to die from depression), the Avars retreated to the Balkan hinterland within two days, never to threaten Constantinople seriously again. Even though the army of Shahrbaraz was still encamped at Chalcedon, the threat to Constantinople was over.

Disappointed by Shahrbaraz&#x27;s failure, Khosrow II sent a messenger bearing a letter to Kardarigan, who was the second-in-command of the Sasanian army. The letter said that Kardarigan should kill Shahrbaraz and take his army back to Ctesiphon, but the bearers of the letter were intercepted in Galatia by Byzantine soldiers, who gave the letter to the future emperor Constantine III who in turn gave it to Heraclius. After reading the letter, he offered to show the letter to Shahrbaraz in a meeting at Constantinople. Shahrbaraz accepted his proposal and met Heraclius at Constantinople, where he read the letter and switched over to Heraclius&#x27; side. Shahrbaraz then changed the contents of the letter, making it state that Khosrow II wanted 400 officers killed, ensuring that Kardarigan and the rest of the army remained loyal to him.

Shahrbaraz then moved his army to northern Syria, where he could easily decide to support either Khosrow or Heraclius at a moment&#x27;s notice. Still, with the neutralization of Khosrow&#x27;s most skilled general, Heraclius deprived his enemy of some of his best and most experienced troops, while securing his flanks prior to his invasion of Iran.

== Overthrow of Khosrow II ==

In 627, Khosrow sent Shahrbaraz a letter, which said that he should send his army to Ctesiphon. Shahrbaraz, however, disobeyed, and moved to Asuristan, where he set up a camp in Ardashir Khurrah. Khosrow then sent Farrukhzad to negotiate with him. However, Farrukhzad made a secret conspiracy against Khosrow and joined Shahrbaraz.

One year later, the feudal families of the Sasanian Empire, who were tired of war against the Byzantines and Khosrow&#x27;s oppressive policies, freed Khosrow&#x27;s son Sheroe, who had been imprisoned by his own father. The feudal families included: Shahrbaraz himself, who represented the Mihran family; the House of Ispahbudhan represented by &quot;spahbed&quot; Farrukh Hormizd and his two sons Rostam Farrokhzad and Farrukhzad; the Armenian faction represented by Varaztirots II Bagratuni; and finally the &quot;kanarang&quot; Kanadbak. In February, Sheroe, along with Aspad Gushnasp, captured Ctesiphon and imprisoned Khosrow II. Sheroe then proclaimed himself as king of the Sasanian Empire on 25 February, assuming the regnal name of Kavadh II. With the aid of Piruz Khosrow, he executed all his brothers and half-brothers, including Khosrow II&#x27;s favorite son Mardanshah. Three days later, he ordered Mihr Hormozd to execute his father. With the agreement of the nobles of the Sasanian empire, Kavad II then made peace with the Byzantine emperor Heraclius; under the terms of this peace, the Byzantines regained all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a war indemnity, along with the True Cross and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614.

Following the loss of territory required for the peace treaty, the embittered aristocracy started forming independent states within the Sasanian Empire. This divided the resources of the country. Furthermore, dams and canals became derelict, and a devastating plague erupted in the western provinces of Iran, killing half of the population along with Kavad II, who was succeeded by Ardashir III.

== Usurping the throne ==

After the death of Kavad II, Heraclius sent Shahrbaraz a letter saying: 

On 27 April 630, Shahrbaraz besieged Ctesiphon with a force of 6,000 men. He was, however, unable to capture the city, and then made an alliance with Piruz Khosrow, the leader of the &quot;Parsig&quot; (Persian) faction, and the previous minister of the Empire during the reign of Ardashir&#x27;s father, Kavad II. He also made an alliance with Namdar Gushnasp, who had succeeded him as the &quot;spahbed&quot; of Nēmrōz in 626. Shahrbaraz, with the aid of these two powerful figures, captured Ctesiphon, and executed Ardashir III along with many Sasanian nobles, including Ardashir&#x27;s minister Mah-Adhur Gushnasp. Shahrbaraz then became the new &quot;shah&quot; (king) of the Sasanian Empire, and killed Kardarigan, who opposed Shahrbaraz after his usurpation of the Sasanian throne.

Heraclius also acknowledged Shahrbaraz&#x27;s Christian son Niketas, as his heir. An Iranian Christian as the heir of the Sasanian Empire opened the chances of the Christianization of Iran. After some time, Shahrbaraz had Shamta, the son of the former financial minister Yazdin, crucified on a church in Margha. The reason of this execution was reportedly because the latter had insulted Shahrbaraz during the reign of Khosrow II. Forty days later, 9 June 630, during a ceremony, Shahrbaraz was killed by a javelin thrown by Farrukh Hormizd, who then helped Boran, the daughter of Khosrow II, to ascend the throne.

== Legacy ==
Shahrbaraz had played an important role in the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, and the events that occurred after the war; his mutiny against Khosrow II caused the Sasanian Empire to fall into a civil war. After the death of Shahrbaraz, his son Shapur-i Shahrvaraz deposed Boran and became king of the Sasanian Empire. His reign, however, did not last long, and he was shortly deposed by the Sasanian nobles. During the same period, Niketas entered in the service of the Byzantines, and would later appear as one of the Byzantine generals at the Battle of Yarmouk during the Arab–Byzantine wars.

A detailed saga of heroism and romance evolved around Shahrbaraz later. In the Islamic period, it was transferred into the legend of Umar ibn al-Numan and his sons which became included in the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, itself influencing the late Byzantine epic of Digenes Akritas.

<doc id="161356" wikidata="Q464749" url="?curid=161356" title="Journey (band)">
<text>Journey is an American rock band formed in San Francisco in 1973 by former members of Santana, the Steve Miller Band, and Frumious Bandersnatch. The band consists of Neal Schon on guitars and vocals (the last remaining original member); Jonathan Cain on keyboards, guitars and vocals; Deen Castronovo on drums and vocals; Arnel Pineda on lead vocals; Jason Derlatka on keyboards and vocals; and Todd Jensen on bass.

Journey had their biggest commercial success between 1978 and 1987, when Steve Perry was lead vocalist; they released a series of hit songs, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27; (1981), which in 2009 became the top-selling track in iTunes history among songs not released in the 21st century. &quot;Escape&quot;, Journey&#x27;s seventh and most successful album, reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, &quot;Open Arms&quot;. The 1983 follow-up album, &quot;Frontiers&quot;, was almost as successful in the United States, reaching number two and spawning several successful singles; it broadened the band&#x27;s appeal in the United Kingdom, where it reached number six on the UK Albums Chart. Journey enjoyed a successful reunion in the mid-1990s and have since regrouped twice; first with Steve Augeri from 1998 to 2006, then with Arnel Pineda from 2007 onward.

Sales have resulted in 25 gold and platinum albums, in addition to the 18-time platinum RIAA Diamond Certified, 1988&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. They have had 19 top-40 singles in the US (the second-most without a &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one single behind Electric Light Orchestra with 20), six of which reached the top 10 of the US chart and two of which reached number one on other &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, and a number-six hit on the UK Singles Chart in &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin. In 2005, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin reached number three on iTunes downloads. Originally a progressive rock band, Journey was described by AllMusic as having cemented a reputation as &quot;one of America&#x27;s most beloved (and sometimes hated) commercial rock/pop bands&quot; by 1978, when they redefined their sound by embracing pop arrangements on their fourth album, &quot;Infinity&quot;.

According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Journey has sold 52 million albums in the US, making them the 11th-best selling band. Their worldwide sales have reached over 100 million records globally, making them one of the world&#x27;s best-selling bands of all time. A 2005 &quot;USA Today&quot; opinion poll named Journey the fifth-best US rock band in history. Their songs have become arena rock staples and are still played on rock radio stations around the world. Journey ranks number 96 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Journey was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the class of 2017. Inductees included Steve Perry, Neal Schon, keyboardists Jonathan Cain and Gregg Rolie, bassist Ross Valory, and drummers Aynsley Dunbar and Steve Smith.

==History==

===1973–1977: Formation, &quot;Journey&quot;, &quot;Look into the Future&quot; and &quot;Next&quot;===

The original members of Journey came together in San Francisco in 1973 under the auspices of former Santana manager Herbie Herbert. Originally called the Golden Gate Rhythm Section and intended to serve as a backup group for established Bay Area artists, the band included Santana alumni Neal Schon on lead guitar and Gregg Rolie on keyboards and lead vocals. Bassist Ross Valory, formerly of both Frumious Bandersnatch and the Steve Miller Band, as well as rhythm guitarist George Tickner of Frumious Bandersnatch rounded out the group. Prairie Prince of The Tubes served as drummer. After one performance in Hawaii, the band quickly abandoned the &quot;backup group&quot; concept and developed a distinctive jazz fusion style. After an unsuccessful radio contest to name the group, roadie John Villanueva suggested the name &quot;Journey&quot;.

The band&#x27;s first public appearance came at the Winterland Ballroom on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1973 to an audience of 10,000. On the following day, the band flew to Hawaii to perform at the Diamond Head Crater to an audience over 100,000 strong. Prairie Prince rejoined The Tubes shortly thereafter; on February 1, 1974, after auditioning up to 28 drummers, the band hired British drummer Aynsley Dunbar, who had recently worked with David Bowie and had been a member of the second iteration of Frank Zappa&#x27;s Mothers of Invention. The new line-up made its debut on February 5, 1974, at the Great American Music Hall in front of Columbia Records executives, and secured a recording contract with the label. The band went on to perform at venues around the Bay Area.

Journey went into CBS Studios in November 1974 with producer Roy Halee to record its debut album, &quot;Journey&quot;. The album was released in April 1975, entering the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts at number 138. Rhythm guitarist Tickner left the band (and the music business to study medicine) due to the amount of heavy touring the band was doing in promoting the album, allowing Schon to take on full guitar duties. The band entered the studio again in late 1975 to record &quot;Look into the Future&quot;, which was released in January 1976 and entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 charts at number 100. The band promoted the album with a two-hour performance at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle, which later aired on the radio as touring continued to promote the album.

From May to October 1976, the band went to His Master&#x27;s Wheels Studios to record its third studio album, &quot;Next&quot;, which—like its predecessor—was produced by the band. This album had a much more commercial sound, while keeping the band&#x27;s jazz fusion and progressive rock roots intact. The album was released in February and charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 at number 85. However, sales did not improve, and Columbia Records was on the verge of dropping the band.

===1977–1980: New musical direction, &quot;Infinity&quot;, &quot;Evolution&quot;, and &quot;Departure&quot;===

As Journey&#x27;s album sales did not improve, Columbia Records requested that they change their musical style and add a frontman who would share lead vocals with Rolie. The band hired Robert Fleischman and made the transition to a more popular style, akin to that of Foreigner and Boston. Journey went on tour with Fleischman in 1977, opening for bands such as Black Sabbath, Target, Judas Priest, and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. Fleischman and the rest of the band began writing and rehearsing new songs, including the soon-to-be-popular track &quot;Wheel in the Sky&quot;. During a performance before about 100,000 at Soldier Field in Chicago, the band was introduced to Steve Perry. Differences between Fleischman and manager Herbie Herbert resulted in Fleischman&#x27;s departure from the band in September of that year.

Journey hired Steve Perry as their new lead singer on October 10, 1977. Perry made his live debut with the band at the Old Waldorf on October 28, 1977, stepping into His Master&#x27;s Studios and Cherokee Studios from October to December. Herbie Herbert, the band&#x27;s manager, hired Roy Thomas Baker as producer to add a layered sound approach similar to that of Baker&#x27;s previously produced band, Queen. With their new lead singer and new producer, the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Infinity&quot;, released in January 1978, peaked at number 21 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The band embarked on a tour in support of the album, when they performed as headliners of a full tour for the first time, beginning with their topping a bill that included Van Halen and Ronnie Montrose.

According to the band&#x27;s manager Herbie Herbert, tensions arose between Aynsley Dunbar and the band due to the change in music direction from the jazz fusion sound. Neal Schon reflected on the tensions: &quot;We would talk about it, and he&#x27;d say he&#x27;d be willing to simplify things, but we&#x27;d get out there, and after five shows, he wasn&#x27;t doing that at all.&quot; Dunbar started playing erratically and talking derogatorily about the other members, which later resulted in Herbert firing Dunbar after the Infinity tour. Dunbar was replaced by Berklee-trained drummer and Montrose member Steve Smith.

Perry, Schon, Rolie, Smith, and Valory entered Cherokee Studios in late 1978 to record their fifth studio album, &quot;Evolution&quot;, which was released in March 1979, peaking at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album, which was a milestone for the band, gave the band their first &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Top-20 single, &quot;Lovin&#x27;, Touchin&#x27;, Squeezin&#x27;&quot;, peaking at number 16, which gave the band significant airplay. Following the tour in support of &quot;Evolution&quot;, the band expanded its operation to include a lighting and trucking operation for their future performances, as the tour had grossed more than $5 million, making the band as popular as it had ever been in five years. The band later entered Automatt Studios to record their sixth studio album, &quot;Departure&quot;, which was released in March 1980, peaking at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The first single from the album, &quot;Any Way You Want It&quot;, peaked at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1980.

Keyboardist Gregg Rolie left the band following the &quot;Departure&quot; tour to start a family and undertake various solo projects. It was the second time in his career he had departed from a successful act. Keyboardist Stevie &quot;Keys&quot; Roseman was brought in to record the lone studio track, &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over (Hopelessly in Love)&quot;, on the band&#x27;s live album &quot;Captured&quot;. Rolie suggested pianist Jonathan Cain of The Babys as his permanent replacement. With Cain&#x27;s synthesizers replacing Rolie&#x27;s organ, Cain had become the new member of the band.

===1981–1983: Height of popularity, &quot;Escape&quot; and &quot;Frontiers&quot;===
With Cain joining as the new keyboard player, the band entered Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California, in late 1980, releasing their seventh studio album, &quot;Escape&quot;, in July 1981. &quot;Escape&quot; became their most successful album, charting at number one in the United States. The album had a clutch of hit singles, which included &quot;Who&#x27;s Crying Now&quot;, &quot;Still They Ride&quot;, &quot;Open Arms&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27;&quot;.

The band began another lengthy yet successful tour on June 12, 1981, supported by opening acts Billy Squier, Greg Kihn Band, Point Blank, and Loverboy, and Journey opened for the Rolling Stones on September 25 in Philadelphia at JFK Stadium. MTV videotaped one of their two sold-out shows at The Summit in Houston on November 6, 1981, in front of over 20,000 fans, later released on DVD.

Following the success of the 1981 tour, the band&#x27;s full establishment as a corporation, and the formation of a fan club called &quot;Journey Force&quot;, the band released &quot;Only Solutions&quot; and &quot;1990s Theme&quot; for the 1982 Disney film, &quot;Tron&quot;. Schon had also made time to work with Jan Hammer on a few albums. Journey continued touring in 1982 with shows in North America and Japan.

With millions of records, hit singles, and tickets sold, the band entered Fantasy Studios again in the middle of their 1982 tour to record their eighth studio album, &quot;Frontiers&quot;. Released in February 1983, the band&#x27;s second-best selling album sold over six million copies, peaking at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, and spawning the hit singles &quot;Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)&quot;, &quot;Faithfully&quot;, &quot;Send Her My Love&quot;, and &quot;After the Fall&quot;.
Journey began the &quot;Frontiers&quot; tour in Japan, and continued in North America with Bryan Adams as opening act. During the tour, NFL Films recorded a video documentary of their life on the road, &quot;Frontiers and Beyond&quot;, shooting scenes at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with more than 80,000 fans in attendance.

===1984–1987: &quot;Raised on Radio&quot; and more personnel changes===
After the &quot;Frontiers&quot; tour, the band took some time off. Lead singer Steve Perry and guitarist Neal Schon both pursued solo projects. In 1984, Perry, with the help of Herbie Herbert, recorded and released his first solo album, &quot;Street Talk&quot;. Neal Schon toured briefly in 1984 with his supergroup HSAS, in support of their sole album, &quot;Through the Fire&quot; released that year on Geffen.

When asked if Journey was over because of the selling of their properties at the end of 1984, Neal Schon commented, &quot;No way Journey&#x27;s ending. We&#x27;re all too committed to this band to ever let that happen. In fact, one of the reasons we decided to go off in separate directions for a while was to keep the band as strong as ever.&quot;

Following a phone call between Cain and Perry, Journey returned to Fantasy Studios in late 1985 to record their ninth studio album, &quot;Raised on Radio&quot;, but with Perry taking the role as the album&#x27;s producer. Tensions within the band were shown when Herbert and Perry fired both bass player Ross Valory and drummer Steve Smith for musical and professional differences a few months into the recording sessions for the album, though Valory later admitted he left the band on his own accord. Bassist and future &quot;American Idol&quot; judge Randy Jackson, bassist Bob Glaub, and established drummer Larrie Londin were brought in to continue the album&#x27;s recordings. &quot;Raised on Radio&quot; was released in May 1986, peaking at number four on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; album chart, but underperforming compared to the band&#x27;s previous two efforts. It featured five singles: The top-10 hit &quot;Be Good to Yourself&quot; along with &quot;Suzanne&quot;, &quot;Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Alright Without You&quot;, and &quot;Why Can&#x27;t This Night Go On Forever?&quot;.

The &quot;Raised on Radio&quot; tour began at Angels Camp in August 1986 and the band performed sold-out shows throughout the United States before concluding with two shows in Anchorage in early 1987, with selected dates supported by Honeymoon Suite, The Outfield, and Glass Tiger. The tour featured both Randy Jackson on bass and Mike Baird on drums, and was videotaped by MTV for a documentary that included interviews with the band members, which was called &quot;Raised on Radio&quot;, the same as the album title.

With tensions between Perry, the band, and the band&#x27;s manager Herbie Herbert at an all-time high following the tour&#x27;s conclusion, Perry was unable or unwilling to remain actively involved, and was tired of touring, as it was affecting his health and his vocals. Herbert had booked fifteen more shows for the tour, but Perry had declined, and told Schon and Cain that he was done with Journey.

===1987–1995: Hiatus===
The band went into a hiatus in 1987 following the conclusion of their &quot;Raised on Radio&quot; tour. Columbia Records released the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation in November 1988, which became one of the best-selling greatest-hits albums, selling over 15 million copies and continuing to sell half a million to a million copies per year. The compilation spent 750 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts until 2008.

While Perry had retreated from the public eye, Schon and Cain spent the rest of 1987 collaborating with artists such as Jimmy Barnes and Michael Bolton before teaming up with Cain&#x27;s ex-Babys bandmates John Waite and Ricky Phillips to form the supergroup Bad English with drummer Deen Castronovo in 1988, releasing two albums in 1989 and 1991. Steve Smith devoted his time to his jazz bands, Vital Information and Steps Ahead, and teamed up with Ross Valory and original Journey keyboardist Gregg Rolie to create The Storm with singer Kevin Chalfant and guitarist Josh Ramos, along with Herbie Herbert as the band&#x27;s manager, as he did with Journey with Scott Boorey.

On November 3, 1991, Schon, Cain, and Perry reunited to perform &quot;Faithfully&quot; and &quot;Lights&quot; at the Bill Graham tribute concert &quot;Laughter, Love &amp; Music&quot; at Golden Gate Park, following the concert promoter&#x27;s death in a helicopter accident. In October 1993, Schon, Rolie, Valory, Dunbar, Smith, and Cain reunited and performed at a private dinner for their manager Herbie Herbert at Bimbo&#x27;s in San Francisco, with Kevin Chalfant on lead vocals.

After the breakup of Bad English in 1991, Schon and Castronovo formed the glam metal band Hardline with brothers Johnny and Joey Gioeli, releasing only one studio album before his departure. Neal later joined Paul Rodgers in 1993 for live performances, alongside Deen Castronovo. In 1994, Steve Perry had released his second solo album &quot;For the Love of Strange Medicine&quot;, and toured North America in support of the album, though his voice had changed since the last time he had performed.

===1995–1997: Reunion and &quot;Trial by Fire&quot;===
Perry made the decision to reunite with Journey under the condition that Herbie Herbert would no longer be the band&#x27;s manager. The band hired Irving Azoff, longtime Eagles manager, as the new manager for the band in October 1995. Steve Smith and Ross Valory reunited with Journey and the band started writing material for their next album, with rehearsals beginning that same month.

The band began recording their 10th studio album, &quot;Trial by Fire&quot;, in early 1996 at The Site and Wildhorse Studio in Marin County and Ocean Way Recorders, in which they recorded under producer Kevin Shirley. It was released in late October that year, peaking at number three on the &quot;Billboard &quot;album charts. The album&#x27;s hit single &quot;When You Love a Woman&quot;, which reached number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, was nominated in 1997 for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. The album also produced three top-40 mainstream rock tracks, &quot;Message of Love&quot; reaching number 18, &quot;Can&#x27;t Tame the Lion&quot; reaching number 33, and &quot;If He Should Break Your Heart&quot; reaching number 38.

Plans for a subsequent tour ended when Perry, troubled by pain while hiking in Hawaii on a 10-day break in August 1996, discovered he had a degenerative bone condition and could not perform without hip-replacement surgery, which for some time he declined to undergo, later admitting he had other physical issues. The accident resulted in the album&#x27;s release date being delayed.

The band took a break following the album&#x27;s release to work on solo projects, waiting for Perry to make up his mind on if he wanted to tour. Schon released his solo album &quot;Electric World&quot; in 1997, later creating Abraxas Pool with former Journey member Gregg Rolie, drummer Michael Shrieve, and a few former Santana members. Cain released his two solo albums, &quot;Body Language&quot; and &quot;For A Lifetime&quot; in 1997 and 1998, respectively.

===1998–2007: Lead singer and drummer replaced, &quot;Arrival&quot; and &quot;Generations&quot;===
Following the reunion album&#x27;s release, the band was becoming restless waiting for an answer from Perry regarding touring. Following a phone call between Cain and Perry, the latter announced that he would be departing from Journey, releasing himself from the band&#x27;s contracts and making the decision to semiretire from the music business, disappearing from the public eye again. Steve Smith later exited the band, citing that Journey would not be the same without Perry, and returning to his jazz career and his project Vital Information.

The band hired drummer Deen Castronovo, Schon&#x27;s and Cain&#x27;s Bad English bandmate and drummer for Hardline, to replace Steve Smith. After auditioning several high-profile candidates, including Geoff Tate, Kevin Chalfant, and John West, Journey replaced Perry with Steve Augeri, formerly of Tyketto and Tall Stories. The band later recorded the song &quot;Remember Me&quot;, which was featured on the soundtrack for the 1998 film &quot;Armageddon&quot;.

Following a rehearsal with Augeri and Castronovo, the band performed four gigs in Japan, a reliable touring stronghold for the band. When asked how he felt about touring for the first time in over a decade, Schon commented: &quot;It&#x27;s a little like we are reborn again.&quot; Journey embarked on a tour in the United States titled Vacation&#x27;s Over, which began in October and concluded at the end of December in Reno. They continued the tour with another leg in 1999, beginning in Minnesota in June and concluding in Michigan in September.

From March to August 2000, the band entered Avatar Studios to record their next studio album, &quot;Arrival&quot; with producer Kevin Shirley. The album was released in Japan later in the year. A North American release of the album followed in April 2001, peaking at number 56 on the Billboard charts. The album&#x27;s single &quot;All the Way&quot; failed to boost sales for the album which was considered a disappointment with mixed reviews and resulted in Sony dropping the band from their label. Upon the album&#x27;s completion, the band embarked on a tour in support of the album in Latin America, the United States, and Europe.

During the events of September 11, 2001, in response to the attacks in New York City, the band joined various other bands at a major fundraising event to help the victims and families of the attack held on October 20 and 21 at the Smirnoff Music Centre in Dallas, Texas. The event raised about $1 million.

Activity for Journey was quiet in 2002, as Schon formed Planet Us with bandmate Castronovo, Sammy Hagar and former Van Halen bassist Michael Anthony until 2004, when Planet Us disbanded. Schon also co-wrote songs with the band Bad Company, while Cain released another solo album. Having made some recordings between 2001 and 2002, the band released a four-track EP titled &quot;Red 13&quot; in November under their new label Journey Music, with an album cover design chosen through a fan contest with the online cover designed by Kelly McDonald, while the retail cover designed by Christopher Payne was only made available at the band&#x27;s performances. The band only performed one club gig in support of the EP, but later began another tour of the United States from May to August in 2003, that included their teaming with Styx and REO Speedwagon in Classic Rock&#x27;s Main Event. The band then toured the following year on the Summer Detour, which began from June and concluded in September 2004. In November, Journey reteamed with both REO Speedwagon and Styx for a tour around the Caribbean aboard the &quot;Triumph&quot; cruise ship.

In 2005, the members of Journey were inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame alongside former members Perry, Dunbar, Tickner, Steve Smith, and Fleischmann. Rolie was the only member who did not appear at the ceremony. Surprised to see Perry joining them to accept the induction with the band, Valory commented on the wonderful things Perry had to say in which he looked to be in fine shape, and that it was a pleasant surprise to see him.

Following their accolade on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the band began recording at the Record Plant in Sausalito, California, for their 12th studio album, &quot;Generations&quot;, with producer Kevin Elson, who had previously collaborated with the band. The album was released on August 29 in Europe, with a North American release following on October 4. The album peaked at number 170 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. To promote the album and celebrate the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary, the band embarked on a tour starting in Irvine, California, in June and concluding in Phoenix in October. Each concert on the tour was three hours long with an intermission and featured many of their classic hits, as well as new songs from the album.

In 2006, the band toured in Europe and then joined Def Leppard in a North American tour. During the tours, however, suggestions arose that Augeri was not singing, but was using backing tracks to cover up his deteriorating vocals, resulting in him getting attacked by the fans. Augeri had been suffering from vocal attrition problems before the band began the tour with Def Leppard, and Journey had been accused of using prerecorded lead vocals, an accusation that former manager Herbie Herbert insists was true. Augeri admitted in a 2022 interview that he wasn&#x27;t legally allowed to say whether it was true or not. In a press statement, the band later announced that Augeri had to step down as Journey&#x27;s lead singer and leave the tour to recover. Augeri performed his last show with Journey on July 4 in Raleigh.

With the successful tour still going on, the band was quick to hire Jeff Scott Soto from Talisman as their lead vocalist. He performed as Journey&#x27;s vocalist for the first time on July 7 in Bristow. Because of its success and popularity, the tour was extended to November. Soto was later officially announced as the band&#x27;s new vocalist in December 2006. Following tours of Europe and the United States in 2007, the band announced on June 12 that Soto was no longer part of the group. In a statement, Schon stated: &quot;He did a tremendous job for us and we wish him the best. We&#x27;ve just decided to go our separate ways, no pun intended. We&#x27;re plotting our next move now.&quot;

===2007–2019: Lead singer replaced with Arnel Pineda, &quot;Revelation&quot; and &quot;Eclipse&quot;===
Following Soto&#x27;s departure, the band was again without a lead vocalist. Neal Schon began searching YouTube for a new lead vocalist, with Jeremey Hunsicker of the Journey tribute band Frontiers auditioning and spending a week with the band writing material. Hunsicker claims to have been formally offered the position, but the offer fell through shortly afterwards following tension with Schon. One of the tracks co-written with Hunsicker, &quot;Never Walk Away&quot;, later appeared on the &quot;Revelation&quot; album. Schon later found Filipino singer Arnel Pineda of the cover band The Zoo, covering the song &quot;Faithfully&quot;. Schon was so impressed that he contacted Pineda to set up two days of auditions, which went well, naming him the official lead vocalist of Journey on December 5, 2007.

Although Pineda was neither the first foreign national to become a member of Journey (former drummer Aynsley Dunbar is British), nor even the first nonwhite (bass player Randy Jackson is African American), his recruitment resulted in some fans of Journey making racist comments towards the new vocalist. Keyboardist Jonathan Cain responded to such sentiments in the &quot;Marin Independent Journal&quot;: &quot;We&#x27;ve become a world band. We&#x27;re international now. We&#x27;re not about one color.&quot;

In 2007, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27;&quot; gained press coverage and a sharp growth in popularity when it was used in &quot;The Sopranos&quot; television series final episode prompting digital downloads of the song to soar.

In November 2007, Journey entered the studio with Pineda to record the studio album, &quot;Revelation&quot;. The album was released on June 3, 2008. It debuted at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, selling more than 196,000 units in its first two weeks and staying in the top 20 for six weeks. As a multidisc set (2-CD) each unit within that set counts as one sale. Journey also found success on Billboard&#x27;s Adult Contemporary chart where the single &quot;After All These Years&quot; spent over 23 weeks, peaking at number nine.

On February 21, 2008, Pineda performed for the first time with Journey in front of 20,000 fans in Chile. The band began the &quot;Revelation&quot; tour in the United Kingdom in June, continuing the tour into North America, Asia, Europe, and South America. The 2008 leg concluded in October. Receipts from the 2008 tour made Journey one of the top-grossing concert tours of the year, bringing in over $35,000,000. On December 18, 2008, &quot;Revelation&quot; was certified platinum by RIAA.

The band performed at the Super Bowl XLIII pregame show in Tampa on February 1, 2009. The band continued their &quot;Revelation&quot; tour in May and concluded it in October 2009. The band had also performed in Manila to 30,000 fans, which was recorded for a live release, &quot;Live in Manila&quot;.

In 2009, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27;&quot; became the top-selling song on iTunes among those released before 2000.

The band entered into Fantasy Studios on 2010 with Pineda to record their studio album, &quot;Eclipse&quot;. The album was released on May 24, 2011, and debuted at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts. The band toured the United Kingdom in June 2011 with Foreigner and Styx. Journey was awarded the prestigious &quot;Legend of Live Award&quot; at the &quot;Billboard &quot;Touring Awards in October. Greatest Hits 2 was released in November.

In June 2015, Deen Castronovo was arrested following a domestic altercation. He was fired by Journey in August and was ultimately replaced by Omar Hakim on the band&#x27;s 2015 tour. In 2016, Steve Smith again returned as Journey&#x27;s drummer, reuniting all of the members of the &quot;Escape-Frontiers-Trial by Fire&quot; lineup except lead singer Steve Perry. Their tour that year also featured Dave Mason and The Doobie Brothers.

In 2017, Journey was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. At the ceremony held on April 7 at the Barclays Center in New York City, Pat Monahan gave the introduction speech. The members included in the induction were all based from their debut album up to when they originally broke up, with the exception of George Tickner. Dunbar, Rolie, Valory, Schon, Perry, Smith and Cain all gave acceptance speeches. When it came time for the band to play, all but Perry performed, with Pineda taking his place.

In 2018, during the North American tour with Def Leppard, Journey topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Tours List by grossing more than $30 million over 17 shows.

===2020–present: Contested lineup changes, lawsuits, and &quot;Freedom&quot;===
On March 3, 2020, Schon and Cain announced that they had fired Smith and Valory and were suing them for an alleged &quot;attempted corporate &quot;coup d&#x27;état,&quot;&quot; seeking damages in excess of $10 million. The lawsuit alleged Smith and Valory tried to &quot;assume control of Nightmare Productions because they incorrectly believe that Nightmare Productions controls the Journey name and mark&quot; to &quot;hold the Journey name hostage and set themselves up with a guaranteed income stream after they stop performing.&quot; Valory and Smith contested the firings, with the support of Perry and former manager Herbie Herbert. Court filings revealed that Perry had been paid as a member of the band for years despite not performing. In an open letter dated that same day, Schon and Cain stated Smith and Valory &quot;are no longer members of Journey, and that Schon and Cain have lost confidence in both of them and are not willing to perform with them again.&quot; Valory countersued Schon and Cain, among other things, for their partnership&#x27;s claim of owning the Journey trademark and service mark (collectively known as the mark), when that partnership, Elmo Partners, was only the licensee of the mark from 1985 to 1994, when the license was terminated by Herbie Herbert of Nightmare Productions, owners of the mark and name. Valory also sought protection against Schon from using any similarities of the Journey mark and name for his side project, Neal Schon – Journey Through Time. On April 1, 2021 it was announced that an amicable settlement had been reached between Schon/Cain and Valory/Smith. In May, Schon and Cain announced that bassist Randy Jackson would once again join the band, replacing Valory, and drummer Narada Michael Walden was announced as an official new member of Journey, replacing Smith.

In June 2020, Schon announced via his social-media page that a new album with Jackson and Walden was &quot;starting to take shape&quot;. The following month, he confirmed the album&#x27;s progress, and confirmed that they would be releasing new music in early 2021. In January 2021, he announced that the first single of the album would be released later that year, with possibly a worldwide tour to follow. The single &quot;The Way We Used to Be&quot; was released on June 24, 2021.

In July 2021, Schon confirmed that Deen Castronovo, who was previously in the band, had rejoined as a second drummer. Meanwhile, Jackson&#x27;s back surgery led to the band bringing in Marco Mendoza to play bass, with Mendoza having previously played with Schon and Castronovo in Neal Schon&#x27;s Journey Through Time. Mendoza&#x27;s stint with Journey, though, only lasted a few months due to Schon&#x27;s feeling that his bass playing did not gel with the band&#x27;s sound, and he was replaced by Todd Jensen, who had previously played with Schon and Castronovo in Hardline.

On February 16, 2022, the band announced the title and track listing of their 15th studio album &quot;Freedom&quot;, which was released on July 8, 2022. The second single from the album, &quot;You Got the Best of Me&quot;, was released on April 26, 2022; the third, &quot;Let It Rain&quot;, on May 17; the fourth, &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up on Us&quot;, on June 7; and the fifth, &quot;United We Stand&quot;, on July 4.

On March 1, 2022, Cain confirmed that neither Walden nor Jackson remained in the lineup, with Walden&#x27;s exit following a minor heart attack following a live show in Pennsylvania. Nevertheless, both were still featured on &quot;Freedom&quot;, as they had completed their parts on the album before their departures. Schon later stated that Walden and Jackson were still &quot;musical members&quot; of the band, and he would certainly write again with Walden in the future. Schon also did not rule out the possibility of former members Perry and Rolie returning for a reunion on the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Although Schon had confirmed that former member Rolie would appear with the band for their tour in January 2023, he later backtracked, stating that Rolie would not be joining for the 50th anniversary tour, although he would later make a guest appearance for the band&#x27;s performance in Austin on February 22, 2023.

Perry filed a lawsuit against Schon and Cain regarding song trademark registrations on September 21, 2022, although he would drop the lawsuit on January 7, 2023. Two months later, Schon filed a lawsuit against Cain over a credit card dispute.

On October 27, 2022, Journey announced its fifth live album, &quot;Live in Concert at Lollapalooza&quot;, which was released on December 9, 2022.

In December 2022, Schon served Cain with a cease and desist order after he performed &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27;&quot; for Donald Trump, stating Cain &quot;has no right to use Journey for politics&quot;. Throughout 2023 to early 2024, the band toured with Toto. Journey toured North America again with Def Leppard throughout July to September 2024, as they previously did in 2006 and 2018. Cain opened up another lawsuit against Schon in July 2024, in which Schon was accused of misusing the band&#x27;s credit cards, which resulted in a UK and Ireland tour being cancelled.

On September 22, 2024, Pineda took to Facebook to respond to criticism following the band&#x27;s performance at Rock in Rio, where he struggled with his ear monitors on stage. He offered to leave the band if one million fans commented &quot;Go&quot; on his post.

On March 8, 2013, a documentary, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27;: Everyman&#x27;s Journey&quot;, was released. The movie, directed by Ramona S. Diaz, chronicles the discovery of Arnel Pineda and his first year with Journey.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin was used as an anthem for patients who were being discharged from New York Presbyterian Queens Hospital and Henry Ford Health System after defeating the virus. On August 21, 2021, Journey played the song live at New York&#x27;s &quot;We Love NYC: The Homecoming Concert&quot;, which was scheduled to celebrate the city&#x27;s emergence from the pandemic.

<text>Luis Juan Alva Castro (born 17 February 1942) is a Peruvian economist and politician. In his political career, he achieved the government positions of Second Vice President of Peru, Prime Minister of Peru, President of the Congress and among other portfolios during both administrations of President Alan García.

A prominent member of the Peruvian Aprista Party, he was the party&#x27;s presidential nominee in 1990, getting 22.5% of the vote and placing third overall and failed to qualify for the runoff that was eventually won by Alberto Fujimori. He has authored numerous works about Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre&#x27;s lifetime, being considered one of the few historians of &quot;Aprismo&quot; in Peru. He currently presides the editorial &quot;Instituto Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre&quot;, which publishes his works.

== Biography ==
Luis Alva Castro was born in the city of Trujillo, in a family with a long Aprista tradition. His parents were Luis Alva and Rosalía Castro.

Transferred to Lima, he completed his primary studies at the Claretian School and his secondary studies at the Leoncio Prado Military School. He returned to his hometown and in 1960 he entered the Faculty of Economics at the National University of Trujillo, where he graduated from high school and obtained the title of economist, thanks to his thesis on &quot;Economic Integration of Latin America&quot; (1964).

In 1996, he studied a postgraduate degree in Political Science at the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega University.

==Political career==

=== Early political career ===
Alva started at a very young age in the Peruvian Aprista Party, being part of the youth wing since he was 15 years old. His first partisan office was Secretary of the Northern Regional Command in 1965. He graduated in 1964 with a Bachelor in Economics from the National University of Trujillo, based on the merit of his thesis titled &quot;Economic Integration of Latin America&quot;.

At 24, he was a member of the board of directors of the Development Corporation of La Libertad (CORLIB), whose experience in planning and management applied him as an executive of private and public companies. The military government of Juan Velasco Alvarado unjustly accused him of mishandling and was imprisoned in a Trujillo prison, from 1970 to 1972.

During the development of the Constituent Assembly of 1978–1979, he served as Private Secretary of Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, becoming one of his most conspicuous disciples.

===Congress ===
In the 1980 general election, he was the Campaign Head of Peruvian Aprista Party presidential nominee Armando Villanueva. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, representing La Libertad for the 1980–1985 term, serving as the Party Spokesperson.

=== In government ===
In 1985, he was selected as part of Alan García presidential ticket for the 1985 general election in which he was the second running mate of García. Jointly reelected to Congress, he was appointed Prime Minister and Finance Minister, serving between 1985 and 1987. Peru developed a steady economy during his tenure, promoting heterodoxy as a good start. The economic plan proposed by Alan García clashed with Alva, leaving his post as the economy would prove to be artificial, evolving into a catastrophic policy of Macroeconomic populism.

One month later after his resignation as both Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Alva was elected as President of the Chamber of Deputies, serving for one year. His increasing party support would prove him as a potential rival in the party leadership to president Alan García. In 1989, he was elected as Secretary General of the Peruvian Aprista Party.

===1990 presidential campaign===
With the country in crisis and the constant attacks from the Shining Path and MRTA, the population participated in the 1990 general election. Since 1987, acclaimed writer Mario Vargas Llosa had prepared a full-scale presidential campaign with the Democratic Front coalition, composed of Liberty Movement, the Christian People&#x27;s Party and Popular Action, the last two being traditional parties. The Peruvian Aprista Party nominated Alva to run for the Presidency against Vargas Llosa, although it was clear that the latter would win in the first round. Unexpectedly, third party nominee and virtually unknown Alberto Fujimori of Cambio 90 rose in the polls with a clear anti-partisan speech, beating Alva to the second round as the APRA achieved 22.5% of the popular vote and placed third. The election outcome would give victory to Alberto Fujimori, with most analysts discussing a possible agreement with president Alan García, as Alva&#x27;s votes would pass on to Fujimori.

===Return to Congress===
The Peruvian Aprista Party, led by Alva from outside Congress as Secretary General, achieved 53 deputies and 16 senators, representing a third of each chamber. The congressional term would end with the 1992 self-coup, which dissolved the entire legislative branch.

In the following years, under the Fujimori&#x27;s government, Alva would not have greater political participation, except in his party when he was elected again as Secretary General in 1996, a position he held until 1999.

In the 2000 general election, he was elected to Congress with a majority of 35,336 votes. The 2000–2005 term would be shortened with the convoking of new general elections for 2001, due to the corruption allegations against Alberto Fujimori and his resignation. In those elections, Alva was reelected to Congress with a majority of 95,050 votes. Based on his experience and high vote count, he was appointed Party Spokesperson, a position he exerted while serving in the abolished Chamber of Deputies. He also served as President of the Andean Community of Nations in 2001.

In August 2005, he was appointed as President of the Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre Private Institute. During this time, he published a renowned work titled &quot;The Asylum Man&quot; (El Señor Asilo), based Haya de la Torre&#x27;s experience as political refugee in the Colombian Embassy in Peru, during the proceedings of the Asylum case determined by the International Court of Justice.

For the 2006 general election, Alva was appointed Peruvian Aprista Party Campaign Head for the North, proving the victory for Alan García with the Aprista stronghold in the North of Peru. Conjointly, he was reelected for a third term in Congress, with a majority of 57,409 votes. During the 2006–2011 parliamentary term, he was elected President of the Congress for a year in 2009, for the 2009-2010, being his first time in charge of the same legislative body since 1987 when he was the President of the Chamber of Deputies.

===Second García administration===
Alva was Minister of the Interior from 2007 to 2008, succeeding Pilar Mazzetti. His tenure lasted a little more than a year and a half. After the resignation of Jorge del Castillo as Prime Minister due to the 2008 Peru oil scandal, Alva Castro was not confirmed in his position by new Prime Minister Yehude Simon, being succeeded by former Police General Remigio Hernani Meloni.

===Post-Congressional career===
Alva failed to achieve a fourth reelection to Congress in the 2011 general election. During the campaign, he was involved in a deadly car accident in the Agallpampa District, Otuzco Province. He was the only survivor, as the other Peruvian Aprista Party provincial leaders accompanying him perished in the accident.

==Controversies==
On 11 April 2019, at the request of chief prosecutor José Domingo Pérez, judge Richard Concepción Carhuancho gave Alva impediment to leave the country for 18 months, for alleged money laundering, in the framework of the investigation by Odebrecht scandal in Peru. According to the prosecutor&#x27;s thesis, Alva, in his position of Campaign Head, personally managed to have the Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht financially support the 2006 Peruvian Aprista Party election campaign, having received USD $200,000 in bribes.

<text>The Kaw Nation (or Kanza or Kansa) is a federally recognized Native American tribe in Oklahoma and parts of Kansas. 

The Kaw people historically lived in the central Midwestern United States. They have also been called the &quot;People of the South wind&quot;, &quot;People of water&quot;, &quot;Kansa&quot;, &quot;Kaza&quot;, &quot;Konza&quot;, &quot;Conza&quot;, &quot;Quans&quot;, &quot;Kosa&quot;, and &quot;Kasa&quot;. Their tribal language is Kansa, classified as a Siouan language.

The state of Kansas was named for this tribe. The name of Topeka, capital city of Kansas, is said to be the Kaw word &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;a good place to grow potatoes&quot;. The Kaw are closely related to the Osage Nation, with whom members often intermarried.

== Government ==
The Kaw Nation&#x27;s headquarters is in Kaw City, Oklahoma, and the tribal jurisdictional area is within Kay County, Oklahoma. The elected chairwoman is Lynn Williams currently serving a four-year term. Of the 3,126 enrolled members, 1,428 live within the state of Oklahoma.

== Economy ==
The estimated annual economic impact of the tribe is $200 million. Kaw Nation owns the Kanza Travel Plaza; Woodridge Market; Smoke Shop I, and II; SouthWind Casino; including a bingo hall, and an off-track wagering facility; and SouthWind Casino Braman, which opened September 2014. The tribe also operates the Kanza Health Clinic, Kanza Wellness Center, Kaw Nation School Age Enrichment Center, Kanza Museum, Kaw Nation Environmental Department, Kaw Nation Police Department, Kaw Nation Social Service and Educational Department, Kaw Nation Emergency Management Department, Kaw Language Department, and the Kaw Nation Judicial Branch. The Kaw Nation Judicial Branch includes a domestic violence program. The Kaw Nation operates its own Housing Authority, library, Title VI Food Services, and issues its own tribal vehicle tags. The &quot;Kanza News&quot;, the newsletter of Kaw Nation, is published quarterly.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The Kaw is a member of the Dhegiha branch of the Siouan language family. Oral history indicates that the ancestors of the five Dhegiha tribes migrated west from the east, possibly somewhere around the Ohio Valley. The Quapaw separated from the other Dhegiha at the mouth of the Ohio, going down the Mississippi River to live in what is today the state of Arkansas. The other Dhegiha proceeded up the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. The Osage left the main group in central Missouri; the Kaw halted upstream on the Missouri River in northwestern Missouri and northeastern Kansas; the Omaha and Ponca continued north to settle in Nebraska and South Dakota.

This tradition is reinforced by the fact that the Illinois and Miami tribes called the lower Ohio and Wabash Rivers the Akansea River, because, as they told French explorers, the Akansea (Quapaw) formerly dwelt there.

The Dhegiha may have migrated westward in the early to mid-17th century. The reason for leaving the traditional home may have been due to the mass displacement westward of Indian tribes caused by European settlement on the Atlantic Coast of the United States. The first certain record of the Dhegiha is 1673 when the French explorer of the Mississippi River, Pere Marquette, drew a crude map which showed the Dhegiha tribes near their historic locations.

The French explorer Bourgmont was the first European to document his visit to the Kaws in 1724. He found them living in a single large village near the future site of the town of Doniphan, Kansas. The Kaw later lived farther downstream near the French Fort de Cavagnial (1744-1764). By the late 1700s, the Kanza took up residence on the Kansas River, but the ruins of their earlier villages and Fort Cavagnial were a landmark for travelers in the early 1800s. When Lewis and Clark ascended the Missouri, they noted passing the site of the French post and Kansa village on July 2, 1804, and the &quot;old village of the Kanzas&quot; of 1724 on July 2, 1804.

=== Traditional culture and subsistence ===
The primary village of the Kanza between about 1790 and 1828 was along the Kansas River near the confluence with the Big Blue River of Kansas. The Kaw had camped and hunted along the Kansas River for at least a century. Moving its primary village to the Kansas River valley put the Kaw closer to the bison herds they hunted annually, and it removed them from other tribes that visited the trading posts along the Missouri River. This new settlement was distanced from the sometimes antagonistic relations with tribes from east of the Missouri River, but was closer to the Pawnee, with whom they were often in conflict. Lewis and Clark noted that their numbers were &quot;reduced by war with their neighbors&quot;. They estimated the Kaw to number 300 men—about 1,500 persons in all.

=== Interaction with the United States ===

The purchase by the United States of Louisiana Territory in 1803 led to disastrous impacts on the Kaw. They were increasingly hemmed in, first, by Eastern Indians forced to migrate west and, secondly, by White settlers who coveted the &quot;beautiful aspects&quot; and &quot;rich and exuberant soils&quot; of Kaw lands. West of the Kaw lived the warlike Cheyenne and Comanche, and to the north were the Pawnee, their traditional enemies. In 1825, the Kaw ceded a huge area of land in Missouri and Kansas to the United States in exchange for a promise of an annuity of $3,500 annually for twenty years. The promised annuity—to be paid in goods and services—was often late in arriving or found its way into the pockets of unscrupulous government officials and merchants. The Kaw were indifferent to the pleas of government agents and missionaries that they take up farming as their sole livelihood.

Meanwhile, the Kaw faced smallpox epidemics in 1827–1828 and 1831–1832, which killed about 500. During the same period the tribe split into four different competing groups living in different villages, a consequence of rivalry between three groups of conservatives, who favored retaining traditional ways, and one group under White Plume which favored accommodation with the United States. Important in the latter group were 23 mixed bloods, the sons and daughters of French traders who had taken Kaw wives. The French influence among the Kaw is still seen in common surnames such as Pappan, Bellmard, and Chouteau.
A disastrous flood in 1844 destroyed most of the land the Kaw had planted and left the tribe destitute. In 1846, the Kaw sold most of their remaining of land for $202,000 plus a reservation centered on Council Grove, Kansas. Council Grove is a beautiful area of forests, water, and tall grass prairie, but it was probably the worst location that could have been selected for the already weakened and demoralized tribe. It was a favorite stopping place for the rough-hewn teamsters and traders and voracious merchants on the Santa Fe Trail. The first Kaw arriving there were beaten up by traders. The flourishing whiskey trade in Council Grove also proved to be deleterious. Whites invaded Indian lands and sporadic efforts by soldiers to force them off the reservation were ineffective. In 1860, the Kaw reservation, overrun by white settlers, was reduced to .

With the coming of the American Civil War in 1861, the Kaw and other Indians in Kansas suddenly became an asset as the state recruited them as soldiers and scouts to stave off invasions by slave-holding tribes and Confederate supporters in Indian Territory. Seventy young Kaw men were persuaded—or forced—to join Company L, 9th Kansas Cavalry Regiment. They served in Indian Territory (Oklahoma) and Arkansas during the war and 21 of them never came home—a large loss to the already diminished numbers of the tribe.
After the war, European-Americans in Kansas agitated for removal of Indians, including the Kaw. However, amidst the gloom of a tribe that seemed likely to disintegrate came one colorful moment. The Kaw and the Cheyenne had long been enemies. On June 1, 1868, about one hundred Cheyenne warriors descended on the Kaw reservation. Terrified white settlers took refuge in Council Grove. The Kaw men painted their faces, donned their finery, and sallied forth on horseback to meet the Cheyenne. The two Indian armies put on a military pageant featuring horsemanship, fearsome howls and curses, and volleys of bullets and arrows. After four hours, the Cheyenne retired with a few stolen horses and a peace offering of coffee and sugar by the Council Grove merchants. Nobody was hurt on either side.

During the battle, the mixed-blood Kaw interpreter, Joseph James, Jr. (more commonly known as Jojim or Joe Jim) galloped 60 miles to Topeka to request assistance from the Governor. Riding along with Jojim was an eight-year-old, part-Indian boy named Charles Curtis or &quot;Indian Charley&quot;. Curtis would later become a jockey, a lawyer, a politician, and Vice President of the United States under Herbert Hoover.

White pressure finally forced the Kaw out of Kansas. On June 4, 1873, they packed up their meager possessions in wagons and headed south to Indian Territory to a new reservation. Two weeks later, 533 men, women, and children arrived at the junction of the Arkansas River and Beaver Creek in what would become Kay County, Oklahoma. The Kaw made their last successful buffalo hunt that winter, journeying on horseback to the Great Salt Plains. They preserved the buffalo meat by jerking it and sold the buffalo robes for five thousand dollars.

The Kaw continued their decline in Oklahoma. In 1879, their agent reported that nearly half of their number had died of contagious diseases in the previous seven years. In the 1880s and 1890s, the Kaw derived much of their income from leasing their land to white ranchers for grazing. In 1884, to manage grazing leases, they elected a government with a Chief Councilor and a representative from each of the four Kaw bands: the Picayune, Koholo, Rock Creek, and Half-breed. Washungah was elected as the Chief Councilor in 1885 and the tribal headquarters was later named Washunga to honor him.

=== 20th century ===

The Kaws found security from white harassment on their Indian Territory lands, but the tribe continued to decline, especially the full bloods. By 1888 they numbered only 188 persons and the Kaws seemed on the road to extinction. However, they slowly acculturated and their numbers increased, mostly through intermarriage as the number of full-bloods continued to decline. By 1910, only one old woman in the tribe could not speak English and more than 80 percent were literate.

The Curtis Act of 1898 expanded the powers of the federal government over Indian affairs. The author of the act was Charles Curtis, now a Congressman. Curtis believed that the Indians should be assimilated and he supported the break-up of tribal governments and the allotment of tribal lands to their members. In 1902, at Curtis&#x27;s urging, Congress abolished the Kaw tribal government and reservation and divided tribal lands among members. Each of 247 Kaw tribal members received , of which were for a personal homestead. Curtis and his son and two daughters thus received of land. Most Kaws sold or lost their land. By 1945, only 13 percent of the land of the former Kaw Reservation was owned by Kaws. Much former Kaw land was inundated by the creation of Kaw Lake in the 1960s, including their Council House and cemetery at Washunga which was moved to Newkirk, Oklahoma.

After the death of Washunga in 1908, the Kaw people had no formal organization for many years. In 1922, Washunga&#x27;s adopted daughter Lucy Tayiah Eads (Little Deer) was elected principal chief along with a council of eight members, and was the first and only female chief, but in 1928 the government agency to the Kaw was abolished and the buildings sold. Thereafter, the Kaw had no recognized government until federal recognition and reorganization of the tribe in 1959. The last Chief of the Kaw, Ernest Emmett Thompson, was elected in 1934. According to Dorothy Roberts full-blooded Kaw women were subject to sterilization by the Indian Health Service in the 1970s. In 1990, the Kaw ratified a new tribal constitution and created a tribal court in 1992. In 2000, the tribe purchased lands on their pre-1873 reservation near Council Grove, Kansas to create a park commemorating their history in Kansas named the Allegawaho Memorial Heritage Park.

The last fluent speaker of the Kansa language, Walter Kekahbah, died in 1983. As of 2012, the Kaw Nation offers online language learning for Kansa second language speakers.

The last full-blood Kaw, William Mehojah, died in 2000.

<doc id="161363" wikidata="Q6972170" url="?curid=161363" title="National Defense Act of 1935">
<text>The National Defense Act of 1935 (Commonwealth Act No. 1) was passed by the Philippine National Assembly on December 21, 1935. The purpose of this act was to create an independent Philippine military, a move interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War.

==Provisions==
This act provided for the creation, by 1946, via an annual appropriation of 16,000,000 pesos, of the following forces:

*A regular army force of 10,000 troops (formed largely from the Philippine Scouts and the Philippine Constabulary)
*A reserve army of 400,000
*The Offshore Patrol, which was to possess 36 torpedo boats
*A Philippine Army Air Corps of 100 tactical bombers

==Office of the Military Advisor==
The National Assembly was guided by the Office of the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government under the U.S. General Douglas MacArthur.

==Military Districts==
The act divided the Commonwealth of the Philippines into ten military districts, similar to the prewar corps areas within the US. Each district had a roughly equal population and each was to initially provide 1 reserve division, and ultimately three.

*Luzon, Mindoro, Palawan, and Masbate contained 5 military districts
*Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago constituted 1 district
*The Visayas contained 4 districts

==Reserve Training==
The Act provided for the drafting of Filipino men, between the ages of 21 and 50, into the 30 reserve divisions. This force was to be raised through 2 training camps, of 20,000 men each, lasting 22 weeks. The camps would be staffed by members of the regular army.

The first group of 20,000 troops was drafted on January 1, 1937, and there were 4,800 officers and 104,000 enlisted men in the reserves by 1939.

==Officer Training==
For the training of junior officers, the Act provided that a military academy be established with a Cadet Corps strength not to exceed 350 at any one time. As graduates could not be expected until they had completed 4 years of training, selected reservists were selected for training as noncommissioned officers. The best of these were then given basic office training and commissioned as 3rd Lieutenants. Officers were also created through senior-level ROTC courses in colleges and universities.

==Training Locations==
*Infantry training—various locations
*Field Artillery training—Fort Dau and specialized training conducted at Fort William McKinley
*Coastal Artillery training -- Fort Mills, Fort Stotsenburg (antiaircraft), and Fort Wint
*Signal and medical training -- Fort William McKinley
*Quartermaster motor transport school — Port area of Manila
*Government organizational training—various locations

<text>Thomas Stewart Baker (born 20 January 1934) is an English actor and writer. He is best known for having played the fourth and longest-serving incarnation of the Doctor in the science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; from 1974 to 1981.

Later in his career, Baker performed in the television series &quot;Medics&quot; (1992–1995), &quot;Randall &amp; Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot; (2000–2001) and &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot; (2004–2005). He also provided narration for the television comedy series &quot;Little Britain&quot; (2003–2006) and &quot;Little Britain USA&quot; (2008). His voice, which has been described as &quot;sonorous&quot;, was voted the fourth-most recognisable in the UK in 2006.

== Early life ==
Thomas Stewart Baker was born on Scotland Road in the Vauxhall area of Liverpool on 20 January 1934. His mother, Mary Jane (&quot;née&quot; Fleming), was a cleaner and devout Catholic. His father, John Stewart Baker, was a seaman and was largely absent from the family due to being away at sea.

Baker attended Cheswardine Hall Boarding School in Shropshire. At age 15, he became a novice religious brother with the Brothers of Ploermel (Brothers of Christian Instruction) in Jersey and later in Shropshire. He left the monastery six years later after losing his faith. In his autobiography, he said he had realised that he wanted to break each of the Ten Commandments—in order—so he thought he should get out before he did something serious.

Baker undertook his national service in the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving from 1955 until 1957. Upon leaving the army, he served in the Merchant Navy.

Baker took up acting around 1956, joining the Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama in Sidcup. He became a professional actor in the late 1960s.

== Career ==
=== Early work ===
Baker was in his thirties when his professional acting career began and he worked in provincial repertory theatre. He had his first break whilst performing in a late-night pub revue for the 1968 York Festival. His performance was seen by someone with the Royal National Theatre who encouraged him to audition for the company, which was headed at the time by Laurence Olivier. Baker did so and was offered a contract. From 1968 to 1971, he was given small parts and understudied; one of his bigger roles was the horse Rocinante in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

Baker&#x27;s stage work led to work on television, where he gained small parts in series such as &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, &quot;Market in Honey Lane&quot; and &quot;Softly, Softly&quot;. In 1972 he played the Egyptian doctor in the BBC’s &quot;Play of the Month&quot; production of Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;The Millionairess&quot;, directed by Bill Slater and starring Maggie Smith, with whom Baker shared several scenes. 

Baker&#x27;s first major film role was as Grigori Rasputin in the film &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; (1971); he was cast after Olivier had recommended him for the part. He was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards for his performance, one for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and another for Best Newcomer. Baker appeared as Moore, an artist whose paintings are imbued with voodoo power, in &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot; (1973), and as Koura, the villainous sorcerer, in Ray Harryhausen&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Voyage of Sinbad&quot; (1973).

Baker also appeared in Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s 1972 film version of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, as the younger husband of the Wife of Bath.

=== &quot;Doctor Who&quot; ===


In early January 1974, Baker wrote a letter to Bill Slater, by then the BBC&#x27;s Head of Serials, looking for work. Reminded of the actor, Slater recommended Baker to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; producer Barry Letts, who at the time was looking for a successor to Third Doctor Jon Pertwee. Letts was impressed by Baker upon meeting him and, after seeing his performance in &quot;The Golden Voyage of Sinbad&quot;, became convinced he was right for the part. Baker was working on a construction site at the time, as acting jobs were scarce. When he first took on the role, the media dubbed him &quot;Boiler Suit Tom&quot; because he had been supplied for a press conference with some old studio-set clothes to replace his modest garments. Baker told the &quot;Daily Express&quot; that his friends teased him that &quot;the BBC scoured London to come up with the only middle-aged-ten-year-old in the business.&quot; Letts left the series after producing Baker&#x27;s debut story, &quot;Robot&quot; (1974–1975), and was replaced by Philip Hinchcliffe. Under Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes, the series gained a &quot;Gothic tone&quot; influenced by Hammer Film Productions and, according to Hinchcliffe, was aimed &quot;a bit more to the adults in the audience&quot;.

Baker quickly made the part his own, and audience-viewing figures for his first few years returned to a level not seen since the height of &#x27;Dalekmania&#x27; a decade earlier. His eccentric style of dress and quirky personality, in particular his trademark look of wearing a long scarf and his fondness for jelly babies, as well as his voice, made him an immediately recognisable figure, and he quickly caught the viewing public&#x27;s imagination. Baker contributed ideas for many aspects of his Doctor&#x27;s personality; he became known for making &quot;frequent and often comedic scripting suggestions and ad-libs&quot;, but the idea of wearing a scarf had been created by accident. James Acheson, the costume designer assigned to his first story, had provided far more wool than necessary to the knitter, Begonia Pope. Due to a miscommunication, Pope knitted all the wool she was given.

During his period as the star of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the original series received its highest viewing figures. Baker played the Doctor for seven consecutive seasons, making him the longest-serving actor in the part, and his incarnation is often regarded as the most popular of the Doctors. According to BBC News in 2006, in polls conducted by &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, Baker only lost the &quot;Best Doctor&quot; category to Sylvester McCoy in 1990 and to David Tennant in 2006. In a 2010 interview, Baker said that he had not watched Tennant&#x27;s performance as the Doctor but thought his &quot;Hamlet&quot; was excellent. Many of the stories from his early period in the role are considered to be classics of the series, including &quot;The Ark in Space&quot; (1975), &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; (1975), &quot;The Brain of Morbius&quot; (1976), &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Robots of Death&quot; (1977). However, the violent tone of the stories produced by Philip Hinchcliffe saw the series come under heavy criticism from morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse. Concerns over violence during this early period led to a lightening of the tone and an &quot;erratic decline&quot; in both the popularity and quality of the series. In a 2014 interview, Baker described Hinchcliffe as &quot;amazing&quot; and identified that as his favourite time on the series. He described Hinchcliffe&#x27;s successor, Graham Williams, as &quot;absolutely devoted&quot; but said he lacked his predecessor&#x27;s flair and had &quot;let me get away with murder&quot;. He acknowledged that his final producer on the series, John Nathan-Turner, had made changes he did not agree with and that they &quot;did not see eye-to-eye really about very much&quot;; according to Baker, the two became good friends afterwards and forgot their disagreements. Baker additionally criticised season 18, his last on the show and Nathan-Turner&#x27;s first as producer, for the decision to increase the number of actors in the regular cast, which Baker felt resulted in stories that relied too much on the Doctor (rather than on other principal characters) to drive the plot forward. Baker ultimately suggested that he may have stayed in the role for one series too many, stating that, in hindsight, he felt it would have been better for him to have left with Williams and let Nathan-Turner recast the role of the Doctor for season 18.

According to Baker in 2017, &quot;When I was doing &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, it was the realisation of all my childhood fantasies... so I took to it like a duck to water, and I still do. &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was more important than life to me—I used to dread the end of rehearsal... that&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t stay away from it.&quot; Although Baker declined to appear in the 20th anniversary &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983) because it was not long since he had left and he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to play 20 per cent of the part&quot; and be &quot;a feed for other Doctors&quot;, he briefly returned to the role of the Doctor for the 30th anniversary charity special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; (1993) and also recorded the audio for the PC video game &quot;Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctors&quot; (1997). Baker continued to be associated with the Doctor, appearing on documentaries such as the 40th anniversary BBC television retrospective &quot;The Story of Doctor Who&quot; (2003) and giving other interviews about his time on the programme, including for documentaries on the extras of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; DVD releases from his era as the Doctor, and he has recorded DVD commentaries for many of the stories.

Baker was also involved in the reading of old Target novelisations in the BBC Audio range of talking books, &quot;&quot;Doctor Who&quot; (Classic Novels)&quot;. &quot;Doctor Who and the Giant Robot&quot; was the first release in the range read by Baker, released on 5 November 2007, followed by Baker reading &quot;Doctor Who and the Brain of Morbius&quot; (released 4 February 2008), &quot;Doctor Who and the Creature from the Pit&quot; (released on 7 April 2008) and &quot;Doctor Who and the Pyramids of Mars&quot; (released 14 August 2008). In October 2009, Baker was interviewed for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Last Word&quot; to pay tribute to the deceased former &quot;Doctor Who&quot; producer Barry Letts. He described Letts as &quot;the big link in changing my entire life&quot; for casting him in the role.

On 20 November 2013, Baker revealed that he would appear in the 50th-anniversary special, &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, stating, &quot;I am in the special. I&#x27;m not supposed to tell you that, but I tell you that very willingly and specifically; the BBC told me not to tell anybody but I&#x27;m telling you straight away.&quot; The episode saw Baker in the role of a mysterious curator in the National Gallery who openly discusses his resemblance to the Fourth Doctor with the Eleventh Doctor.

Baker also filmed inserts in 1992 for a video release of the unfinished Douglas Adams &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Shada&quot;, originally begun in 1979 but abandoned due to strike action, and presented the video release &quot;The Tom Baker Years&quot; (1992), which was a look back at his time on the series with Baker watching short clips from his episodes. In November 2017, Baker returned to the Doctor role by completing &quot;Shada&quot;. Animation was added to complete the original story. He also filmed one new scene for inclusion in the final episode.

====&quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio dramas====

While Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Paul McGann have all reprised their roles for audio adventures produced by Big Finish Productions and the BBC since the 1990s, Baker declined to voice the Doctor until 2009, saying that he had not seen a script he liked. In July 2009, the BBC announced that Baker would return to the role for a series of five audio dramas, co-starring Richard Franklin as Captain Mike Yates, which would begin release in September. The five audios comprise a single linked story under the banner title &quot;Hornets&#x27; Nest&quot;, written by author Paul Magrs. He returned with a sequel to &quot;Hornets&#x27; Nest&quot; called &quot;Demon Quest&quot;.

In March 2011, it was announced that Baker would be returning as the Fourth Doctor initially for two series of plays for Big Finish Productions, starring alongside former companions Leela (Louise Jameson) and Romana I (Mary Tamm). The first series of six audios were released starting in January 2012. Big Finish had also arranged for Baker to record a series of stories reuniting him with Elisabeth Sladen&#x27;s character Sarah Jane Smith (for which special permission was obtained from the producers of &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; TV series), but Sladen died in April 2011 before any stories could be recorded. Baker has also recorded several Big Finish audio stories with Matthew Waterhouse, who played Adric, and Lalla Ward, who played Romana II, although Ward recorded her sections separately.

It was reported in April 2020 that Baker had recorded &quot;Return of the Cybermen&quot; for Big Finish, an alternative version of the story &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot; (1975), with Sadie Miller, Elisabeth Sladen&#x27;s daughter, taking over the role of Sarah Jane Smith from her mother. The story was released in March 2021.

Baker also returned to the role of the Curator for Big Finish, joining the casts of &quot;The Eighth Doctor Adventures&quot; and &quot;UNIT: The New Series&quot;.

=== Later film and television work ===

In 1982, Baker portrayed Sherlock Holmes in a four-part BBC1 miniseries version of &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;; in the US, this production was telecast on A&amp;E. He also made an appearance in &quot;Blackadder II&quot;, in the episode &quot;Potato&quot;, as the sea captain &quot;Redbeard Rum&quot;. He played Puddleglum, a &quot;marsh-wiggle&quot;, in the 1990 BBC adaptation of C. S. Lewis&#x27; &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;.

For the third series of the British game show &quot;Cluedo&quot;, Baker was cast as Professor Plum, a &quot;man with a degree in suspicion&quot;. He was also cast in the 2004 series &quot;Strange&quot;, as a blind priest who possessed knowledge of the Devil. In addition, he played the part of Donald MacDonald in the BBC series &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot;, from 2004 until 2005. Previously, he had appeared as a guest on the quiz show &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot; and was subsequently described by presenter Angus Deayton as the funniest guest in the series&#x27; history. A particular highlight was when Baker gave an anecdotal account of how, while entering a recording studio in Wales, he was accosted by a member of the public who told Baker: &quot;I will never forgive you, nor will my wife, for what you did to our grammar schools.&quot; Baker responded with: &quot;What are you talking about, you daft bugger?&quot; to which the stranger replied: &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry. For a moment I thought you were Shirley Williams.&quot;

Baker later returned to &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot; as a guest host in 2008. Baker played the role of the Captain in the Challenge version of &quot;Fort Boyard&quot;, and has also hosted the children&#x27;s literature series, &quot;The Book Tower&quot;. He recorded a special called, &quot;Tom Baker – In Confidence&quot; that was shown in April 2010.

In the late 1990s, it was reported that Baker was a candidate for the role of Gandalf in the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films. Baker has since stated that he was only approached for &quot;a role&quot; in the film, and turned down the offer when told that it would mean spending months away in New Zealand. He appeared as Halvarth, the Elven healer, in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (2000).

=== &quot;Little Britain&quot; ===

After his work on &quot;Lionel Nimrod&#x27;s Inexplicable World&quot;, Baker was cast as a similar narrator of &quot;Little Britain&quot; on BBC Radio 4 and remained in the role when it transferred to television. He has suggested that he was chosen for the part in &quot;Little Britain&quot; due to his popularity with creators Matt Lucas and David Walliams, part of the generation for whom he is the favourite Doctor. &quot;I am now being employed by the children who grew up watching me&quot;, he stated in a DVD commentary. Another trademark of &quot;Little Britain&quot;″s narration is the deadpan quotation of old rap lyrics, usually in the opening credit sequence. On 17 November 2005, to mark the start of the third series of &quot;Little Britain&quot;, Baker read the continuity announcements on BBC One from 7 pm to 9:30 pm GMT. The scripts were written by Lucas and Walliams; Baker assumed his &quot;Little Britain&quot; persona. He used lines such as:

=== Voice acting ===

Baker has appeared in various radio productions, including a role as &quot;Britain&#x27;s most celebrated criminal barrister&quot;, Sir Edward Marshall-Hall in &quot;John Mortimer Presents the Trials of Marshall Hall&quot; (1996), &quot;Josiah Bounderby&quot; in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1998) and a part in the 2001 BBC Radio 4 version of &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot; as Sir Walter Bullivant. He guest starred in &quot;The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (a pastiche series written by Bert Coules) in the 2002 episode &quot;The Saviour of Cripplegate Square&quot;. From 2000 to 2005 Baker voiced the character Max Bear in the Channel 4 (UK) Max Bear Productions animated series. He also voiced the role of the villain ZeeBad in the 2005 animated film version of &quot;The Magic Roundabout&quot;. In 2007, he voiced the character of Robert Baron in the BBC animated series &quot;The Secret Show&quot;.

Baker narrated the children&#x27;s animated series &quot;The Beeps&quot; which was shown on Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;Milkshake!&quot; as well as narrating &quot;Tales of Aesop&quot; on BBC, a television series with puppetry based on Aesop&#x27;s Fables. Most recently, Baker has returned to the role of the Fourth Doctor, first in three series of audio adventures for BBC Audiobooks: &quot;Hornet&#x27;s Nest&quot;, &quot;Demon Quest&quot; and &quot;Serpents&#x27; Crest&quot;; and now in a new series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio adventures for Big Finish Productions also starring Louise Jameson as &quot;Leela&quot;. There were seven releases in 2013 with Mary Tamm as Romana: (&quot;The Auntie Matter&quot;, &quot;The Sands of Life&quot;, &quot;War Against the Laan&quot;, &quot;The Justice of Jalxar&quot;, &quot;Phantoms of the Deep&quot;, &quot;The Dalek Contract&quot; and &quot;The Final Phase&quot;).

In the third season of the animated series &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, Baker provided the voice of Bendu, a powerful Force-sensitive being.

=== Video games ===
Baker starred as the Fourth Doctor in the 1997 video game &quot;Destiny of the Doctors&quot; where he provided the voice. His voice has also been featured in &quot;Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future&quot; (2000), &quot;Warhammer 40,000: Fire Warrior&quot; (2003), &quot;Sudeki&quot; (2004), &quot;Cold Winter&quot; (2005), &quot;: Resurrection&quot;, &quot;Hostile Waters: Antaeus Rising&quot;, and &quot;Little Britain: The Video Game&quot; (2007).

=== Narration ===
Baker is a prolific voiceover artist and his voice was voted as the fourth most recognisable in the UK in 2006 after the Queen, Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher.
In 1992 and 1993, Baker narrated BBC radio comedy series &quot;Lionel Nimrod&#x27;s Inexplicable World&quot;. In 1994 he provided the narration for Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Equinox&quot; rave documentary &quot;Rave New World&quot;. In 2002 he had a speaking role in the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful &quot;Hostile Waters&quot; as the Narrator.

Baker voiced both the narrator and the god &quot;Tetsu&quot; in the role-playing game &quot;Sudeki&quot;, but was uncredited. Baker was also the uncredited narrator for the 1985 science fiction movie &quot;Enemy Mine&quot;. During the first three months of 2006, his voice was used by BT for spoken delivery of text messages to landline phones. He recorded 11,593 phrases, containing every sound in the English language, for use by the text-to-speech service. The BT text message service returned from 1 December 2006 until 8 January 2007, with two pence from each text going to the charity Shelter. Also, a single &quot;sung&quot; by Baker&#x27;s text voice, &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; by The Kinks, was released on 18 December 2006 with proceeds going to the charity. The creator of the song was Mark Murphy, designer of the site.

Baker&#x27;s voice may be heard at London&#x27;s Natural History Museum narrating commentary to some of the exhibits that demonstrate Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection. He has made three other brief forays into the world of music: he provides the monologue to the track &quot;Witness to a Murder (Part Two)&quot; on the album &quot;Six&quot; by Mansun; he appears on Technocat&#x27;s single &quot;Only Human&quot; in 1995, and in 2002 he recorded the monologue to the track &quot;Megamorphosis&quot; on the album &quot;Andabrek&quot; by Stephen James, although the album was not released until 2009. Baker provides narrative at two British tourist attractions: the Nemesis roller coaster at Alton Towers, Staffordshire; and the London Dungeon, a museum depicting gory and macabre events in the capital, narrating the events leading up to and comprising the Great Fire of London.

Baker voiced the character &quot;Max Bear&quot;, a series of animated stories broadcast on Channel 4 (UK Terrestrial) from 2000 to 2005. He narrated Australian cartoonist Bruce Petty&#x27;s 2006 film about world politics, &quot;Global Haywire&quot;.

=== Books ===
Baker&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Who on Earth is Tom Baker?&quot; was published in 1997 and made available on Kindle devices in September 2013.

Baker has also written a short fairytale-style novel called &quot;The Boy Who Kicked Pigs&quot;. In 1981 he edited a collection of poems for children: &quot;Never Wear Your Wellies in the House and Other Poems to Make You Laugh&quot;.

In 2019, Baker released a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel called &quot;Scratchman.&quot; Co-written with James Goss, the novel is based on a script Tom Baker and Ian Marter wrote for a proposed &quot;Doctor Who&quot; film in the 1970s. The plot involves the Fourth Doctor meeting Scratchman, who may be the devil.

=== Theatre ===
In 1966, Baker became a member of Frank Dunlop&#x27;s Pop Theatre Company production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, which was performed at that year&#x27;s Edinburgh International Festival and in the Cambridge Theatre, London. Other cast members included &quot;&quot;Carry On...&quot;&quot; stalwart Jim Dale and up-and-coming actress Jane Asher: Baker played several small roles within the play, including the infamous &quot;bear&quot;.

Baker joined the National Theatre in 1968 as an understudy for &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead&quot; followed by small parts in &quot;The National Health&quot; by Peter Nichols (directed by Michael Blakemore).

After playing the horse in &quot;The Travails of Sancho Panza&quot; (directed by Joan Plowright), Laurence Olivier subsequently cast him as the Prince of Morocco in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. The play was directed by Jonathan Miller, with Baker appearing alongside Olivier as Shylock. Still under contract at the National, Baker also played a Russian in &quot;The Idiot&quot;, Sir Frances Acton in &quot;A Woman Killed With Kindness&quot;, opposite Anthony Hopkins, and Filippo in &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot;.

After leaving the role of the Doctor in 1981, Baker returned to theatre to play Oscar Wilde in &quot;Feasting with Panthers&quot; at the Chichester Festival Theatre. The following year, he played Judge Brack in &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;, with Susannah York as Hedda, in the West End. Also in 1982, Baker played Dr. Frank Bryant in a Royal Shakespeare Company production of &quot;Educating Rita&quot;, alongside Kate Fitzgerald as Rita. He returned to the National Theatre in 1984 to play Mr Hardcastle in &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; in the Olivier Theatre and on a later tour. The following year he played both Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty in &quot;The Mask of Moriarty&quot; by Hugh Leonard at the Gate Theatre in Dublin.

In 1987, Baker played Inspector Goole in a revival production of &quot;An Inspector Calls&quot; directed by Peter Dews.

=== Music ===
In 1998, Baker provided narration on the track &quot;Witness to a Murder (Part 2)&quot; on the album &quot;Six&quot; by the English alternative rockband Mansun.

On 13 May 2020, Dutch producer and songwriter Arjen Anthony Lucassen announced that Baker would provide spoken vocals for the character of &quot;The Storyteller&quot; on Ayreon&#x27;s album, &quot;Transitus&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Baker&#x27;s first marriage was in 1961, to Anna Wheatcroft, niece of rose grower Harry Wheatcroft; they had met and started dating whilst at acting school. They had two sons (Daniel and Piers) and divorced in 1966. Baker lost contact with his sons until a chance meeting with Piers in a New Zealand pub allowed them to renew their relationship. In December 1980, he married Lalla Ward, who had co-starred in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as his character&#x27;s companion Romana. They divorced in April 1982.

Baker married for a third time on 1 April 1986, to Sue Jerrard, who had been an assistant editor on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. They moved to the Bell House, a converted school in Boughton Malherbe, Kent, where they kept several cats before moving to France in January 2003. They sold the property to Vic Reeves shortly after Baker had worked with him on the BBC revival of &quot;Randall and Hopkirk&quot;. In November 2006, Baker bought a house in Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, before later moving to Rye, East Sussex.

Baker is critical of religion and describes himself as irreligious, or occasionally as Buddhist, but not anti-religious. Politically, Baker has expressed disdain for the Conservative Party and New Labour, saying in 1998, &quot;when the Conservatives were in I cannot tell you how much I hated them, but I realise how shallow I am because I now hate the Labour Party as much.&quot;

Baker was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2025 New Year Honours for services to television.

== Popular culture ==
* English synthpop band the Human League recorded a track entitled &quot;Tom Baker&quot;. In 1981 it was released as the B-side to their &quot;Boys and Girls&quot; single. The instrumental track was re-released on some CD versions of their &quot;Travelogue&quot; album. The song was inspired by the incidental music of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.
* A cartoon of Tom Baker, as the Fourth Doctor, appeared as one of the &quot;esteemed representatives of television&quot; in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episodes &quot;Sideshow Bob&#x27;s Last Gleaming&quot;, &quot;Treehouse of Horror X&quot;, and &quot;Mayored to the Mob&quot;. A fan of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; since childhood, &quot;Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening favours Tom Baker&#x27;s Doctor. &quot;Simpsons&quot; writer Ron Hauge said, &quot;There are several &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actors but Tom Baker is the one we always go with.&quot;
* Impressionist Jon Culshaw regularly impersonates Baker in the comedy series &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;. On one episode of &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, Culshaw called Baker himself using his impersonation, introducing himself as the Doctor. An amused Baker replied, &quot;No, there must be a mistake. &quot;I&#x27;m&quot; the Doctor!&quot; The episode was so well received, that Baker later appeared with Culshaw in the 2001 TV movie &quot;Alter Ego&quot;. Dressed identically, Culshaw as Baker said &quot;It&#x27;s very nice to meet me.&quot; Whereupon Baker replied &quot;Yes, well it&#x27;s very nice to be met.&quot;
* A fictional version of Baker appears in the Kevin Sampson novel &quot;Awaydays&quot;. In this story, he is attending the seventh International &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Convention in Halifax in December 1979, where the chief protagonists of the novel (a group of Tranmere Rovers hooligans) accidentally gatecrash. They befriend him and try to persuade him to tour the country as the Doctor sets fire to his farts. This was not included in the film version of the novel. In the DVD of the film the producer wanted to include extra scenes of Baker from &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes, but the BBC refused because of the violent nature of the film.

<text>Thick as a Brick is the fifth studio album by the British rock band Jethro Tull, released on 3 March 1972. The album contains one continuous piece of music, split over two sides of an LP record, and is intended as a parody of the concept album genre. The original packaging, designed as a 12-page newspaper, claims the album to be a musical adaptation of an epic poem by fictional eight-year-old genius Gerald Bostock, though the lyrics were actually written by the band&#x27;s frontman, Ian Anderson.

The album was recorded in late 1971, featuring music composed by Anderson and arranged with the contribution of all band members. The album was the band&#x27;s first to include drummer Barrie &quot;Barriemore&quot; Barlow, replacing the band&#x27;s previous drummer Clive Bunker. The live show promoting the album included the playing of the full suite, with various comic interludes. &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; is considered by critics to be the first Jethro Tull release to entirely consist of progressive rock music. It received mixed reviews upon its release, but was a commercial success and topped various charts in 1972. Today it is regarded as a classic of progressive rock, and has received several accolades. Anderson produced a follow-up to the album in 2012, focusing on the adult life of the fictional Gerald Bostock, and being released as Anderson&#x27;s solo album instead of as Jethro Tull&#x27;s album.

==Background==
Jethro Tull&#x27;s frontman and songwriter Ian Anderson was infuriated when critics called the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Aqualung&quot; (1971), a &quot;concept album&quot;. He rejected this, thinking it was simply a collection of songs, so in response decided to &quot;come up with something that really is the mother of all concept albums&quot;. Taking the surreal British humour of Monty Python as an influence, he began to write a piece that would combine complex music with a sense of humour, with the idea it would poke light-hearted fun at the band, the audience, and the music critics. He also intended to satirise the progressive rock genre that was popular at the time. His wife Jennie was also an inspiration, to whom he credited having devised the character and lyrics of &quot;Aqualung&quot;. She had written a letter to Anderson while he was away touring the album, ten lines from which Anderson used as inspiration for the new material.

Anderson has also said that &quot;the album was a spoof to the albums of Yes and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, much like what the movie &quot;Airplane!&quot; had been to &quot;Airport&quot; and later remarked that it was a &quot;bit of a satire about the whole concept of grand rock-based concept albums&quot;. Although Anderson wrote all the music and lyrics, he co-credited the writing to a fictional schoolboy named Gerald Bostock. The humour was subtle enough that some fans believed that Bostock was real. Reviewing the 40th anniversary reissue, Noel Murray suggested that many listeners of the original album &quot;missed the joke&quot;.

==Recording==
The group ran through two weeks of rehearsals using the Rolling Stones&#x27; basement studio in Bermondsey. They had not intended to record a single continuous piece; the band came up with individual song segments, then decided to write short pieces of music to link them together.

Recording started in December 1971 at Morgan Studios, London. Unlike previous albums, where Anderson had generally written songs in advance, only the initial section of the album had been worked out when the band went into the studio. The remainder of the suite was written during the recording sessions. To compensate for a lack of material, Anderson began work early each morning to prepare music for the rest of the band to learn during that day&#x27;s session. The lyrics were written first, with the music constructed to fit around them. Anderson recalls the album took about two weeks to record and another two or three for overdubs and mixing. The final work spanned the entire length of an LP record, split over two sides.

The group remembered the recording being a happy process, with a strong feeling of camaraderie and fun, with numerous practical jokes. They were fans of Monty Python, and this style of humour influenced the lyrics and overall concept. Guitarist Martin Barre recalls the whole band coming up with various ideas for the music. Some parts were recorded in a single take with every member having an input, including significant contributions from keyboardist John Evan.

==Musical style==
&quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; was viewed by some critics as Jethro Tull&#x27;s first progressive rock album. The album has a variety of musical themes, time signature changes and tempo shifts – all of which were features of the progressive rock scene. Although the finished album runs as one continuous piece, it is made up of a medley of individual songs that run into each other, none of which individually lasts more than 3–5 minutes. Parts of the suite blend classical and folk music into the typical rock music framework.

The album prominently features flute, acoustic and electric guitars and Hammond organ, which had been used previously, but the instrumentation includes harpsichord, glockenspiel, timpani, violin, lute, trumpet, saxophone, and a string section—all uncommon in the band&#x27;s earlier blues-inspired rock. Anderson later said that the lyrics were partly derived from his own childhood experiences, though the overall theme was Bostock&#x27;s attempt to make sense of life from his point of view.

==Cover==
The original LP cover was designed as a spoof of a 12-page small-town English newspaper, entitled &quot;The St. Cleve Chronicle and Linwell Advertiser&quot;, with articles, competitions and advertisements lampooning the typical and amateurish journalism of the local English press. The band&#x27;s record company, Chrysalis Records, complained that the sleeve would be too expensive to produce, but Anderson countered that if a real newspaper could be produced, a parody of one was also practicable.

The mock newspaper, dated 7 January 1972, also includes the entire lyrics to &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; (printed on page 7), which is presented as a poem written by Bostock, whose disqualification from a poetry contest is the focus of the front-page story. This article claims that although Bostock initially won the contest, the judges&#x27; decision was repealed after protests and threats concerning the offensive nature of the poem, along with the boy&#x27;s suspected psychological instability. The front cover includes a piece where Bostock is accused without foundation of being the father of his 14-year-old friend Julia&#x27;s child. The inside of the paper features a mock review by &quot;Julian Stone-Mason BA&quot;, a pseudonym of Anderson.

The contents of the newspaper were written mostly by Anderson, bassist Jeffrey Hammond and keyboardist John Evan. While some of the pieces were obviously silly, such as &quot;Magistrate Fines himself&quot;, there was a lengthy story entitled &quot;Do Not See Me Rabbit&quot; about a pilot in the Battle of Britain being shot down by a Messerschmitt Bf 109. The overall layout was designed by Chrysalis&#x27; Roy Eldridge, who had previously worked as a journalist. Most of the characters in the newspaper were members of the band, their management, road crew, or colleagues; for instance, recording engineer Robin Black played a local roller-skating champion. Anderson recalls that the cover took longer to produce than the music.

The satirical newspaper was heavily abridged for conventional CD booklets, but the 25th Anniversary Special Edition CD cover is closer to the original, and the 40th anniversary boxed version contains most of the content from the original newspaper.

==Live performances==

Following the album&#x27;s release, the band set out on tour, playing the entire piece with some extra musical additions that extended performances to over an hour. At the start of the show, men wearing capes appeared onstage and began sweeping the floor, counting the audience and studying the venue; after a few minutes, some of them revealed themselves to be members of the band and began to play. During some shows, the entire band stopped mid-performance when a telephone rang on stage, which Anderson would answer, before carrying on performing. News and weather reports were read halfway through the show, and a man in a scuba diver outfit came onstage. The tour&#x27;s humour caused problems in Japan, where audiences responded to the changes with bewilderment. Barre recalls these first live performances being &quot;a terrible experience&quot; as there was a lot of complex music with a variety of time signature changes to remember.

Anderson performed the entire album live on tour in 2012, the first complete performances since the original tour. In August 2014, Anderson released the CD/DVD/Blu-ray &quot;Thick as a Brick – Live in Iceland&quot;. The concert was recorded in Reykjavík, Iceland, on 22 June 2012, and featured complete &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; and &quot;Thick as a Brick 2&quot; performances by the Ian Anderson Touring Band. Some of the humour and stage antics were maintained—especially the telephone ringing in the middle of a song, which was replaced by a cell phone and a Skype call.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; was originally scheduled for release on 25 February 1972. Following production problems relating to the 1972 miners&#x27; strike, it was held back a week to 3 March. The album reached the top 5 in the UK charts, and number one in Australia, Canada and the United States, where it was certified Gold.

Contemporary reviews were mixed. Chris Welch of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; praised the musicianship of the band and Anderson&#x27;s flute playing, writing also that &quot;the joke at the expense of a local newspaper wears thin rather rapidly, but should not detract from the obvious amount of thought and work that has gone into the production of &quot;Thick&quot;&quot;; he described the music as a creative effort where &quot;the ideas flow in super abundance&quot; but that &quot;needs time to absorb&quot; and &quot;heard out of context of their highly visual stage act ... does not have such immediate appeal&quot;. Tony Tyler in his review for &quot;New Musical Express&quot; generally appreciated the construction of the suites and the arrangements, but he had doubts about the album&#x27;s possible success. He called &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; &quot;Jethro Tull&#x27;s own stand-or-fall epic after the lines of &quot;Tommy&quot;&quot; and &quot;an assault on the mediocrity and harshness of lower-middle-class existence in &#x27;70s Britain&quot;. Ben Gerson in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine called &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; &quot;one of rock&#x27;s most sophisticated and ground-breaking products&quot;. Going further, the reviewer stated: &quot;Martin Barre&#x27;s guitar and John Evan&#x27;s keyboards especially shine, and Ian&#x27;s singing is no longer abrasive. Whether or not &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot; is an isolated experiment, it is nice to know that someone in rock has ambitions beyond the four- or five-minute conventional track, and has the intelligence to carry out his intentions, in all their intricacy, with considerable grace.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Alan Niester gave it 2 out of 5 stars in &quot;The Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot;, judging it had &quot;relatively undifferentiated movements&quot;. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau disliked the album, calling it &quot;the usual shit&quot; from the band: &quot;rock (getting heavier), folk (getting feyer), classical (getting schlockier), flute (getting better because it has no choice)&quot;.

Retrospective reviews have been positive. AllMusic wrote that &quot;Jethro Tull&#x27;s first LP-length epic is a masterpiece in the annals of progressive rock, and one of the few works of its kind that still holds up decades later.&quot; Jordan Blum of PopMatters thinks that the album &quot;paved the way for modern progressive rock&quot; and &quot;today, it represents not only a pinnacle achievement for Jethro Tull, but also a concrete example of just how adventurous and free artists used to be.&quot; &quot;Record Collector&quot;″s reviewer writes that &quot;today, free from the irrelevant context of misdiagnosis and derision that dogged it on its original release, the album sounds like nothing less than an Olympian feat of composition and musicianship.&quot; According to &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; reviewer Adam Budofsky, &quot;that it remains so elevated in progressive rock fans&#x27; hearts and minds forty years later is a testament to its quality.&quot; Paul Stump&#x27;s &quot;History of Progressive Rock&quot; commented of the album, &quot;The &#x27;concept&#x27;, a somewhat self-conscious and mannered lionization of individual genius ... against caricatured bourgeois Philistinism, scarcely sees the light of day through the thickets of Anderson&#x27;s imagery, but this doesn&#x27;t detract from what, in hindsight, is quite a respectable, if periodically water-treading, stab at advanced extensional technique.&quot;

In 2014, &quot;Prog&quot; magazine listed &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; at number 5 in the list &quot;The 100 Greatest Prog Albums of All Time&quot;, voted for by its readers. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed the album at number 7 in their &quot;Top 50 Prog Albums of All Time&quot;. Rush&#x27;s Geddy Lee has said &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; is one of his favourite albums, as has Iron Maiden&#x27;s Steve Harris.

== Reissues ==
The album has been reissued on CD several times: the first CD release (1985), the MFSL-release (1989), the 25th Anniversary Edition (1997), and the 40th Anniversary Edition (2012).

The 40th Anniversary Edition was released in November 2012, and includes a CD, a DVD, and a book. The CD contains a new mix of the album. The DVD contains a 5.1 surround sound mix (in DTS and Dolby Digital), the new stereo mix in high resolution, and the original stereo mix in high resolution. The first pressing of the DVD/CD box contained a faulty DVD with significant audio errors. A corrected replacement edition was issued later, with only a horizontal line beneath the &quot;album duration&quot; note on the disc label to identify it. The album was also re-released on vinyl at the same time. This edition lists part one at 22:45 and part two at 21:07.

For the 50th anniversary, a new vinyl pressing of the Wilson remix, mastered at half speed, was released with the original newspaper cover. The CD/DVD bookset was also reissued, still titled 40th Anniversary Edition, but with the mastering on all versions of the remix as originally intended by Wilson. It can be differentiated from the original pressing by the copyright dates on the back and by being released on Parlophone instead of EMI.

==Covers and follow-ups==
In 2012, Ian Anderson announced plans for a follow-up album, &quot;Thick as a Brick 2: Whatever Happened to Gerald Bostock?&quot;. According to the Jethro Tull website, the sequel is &quot;a full length Progressive Rock &#x27;concept&#x27; album worthy of its predecessor. Boy to man and beyond, it looks at what might have befallen the child poet Gerald Bostock in later life. Or, perhaps, any of us.&quot;

The follow-up album was released on 2 April 2012. It describes five different scenarios of Gerald Bostock&#x27;s life, where he potentially becomes a greedy investment banker, a homeless homosexual man, a soldier in the Afghan War, a sanctimonious evangelist preacher, and a most ordinary man who runs a corner store and is married and childless. &quot;Thick as a Brick 2&quot; lists 17 separate songs merged into 13 distinct tracks (some labelled as medleys), although also all flowing together much like a single song. To follow the style of the mock newspaper on the original &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;, a mock online newspaper was set up.

While &quot;TAAB 2&quot; was a follow-up &quot;about&quot; Gerald Bostock, the 2014 Ian Anderson solo album &quot;Homo Erraticus&quot; was presented as a follow-up work by Gerald Bostock. In the backstory Anderson created for the album, the now middle-aged Bostock came across an unpublished manuscript by one Ernest T. Parritt (1873–1928), entitled &quot;Homo Britanicus Erraticus&quot;. Parritt was convinced he lived past lives as historical characters, and wrote detailed accounts of these lives in his work; he also wrote of fantasy imaginings of lives yet to come. Bostock then created lyrics based on Parritt&#x27;s writings, while Anderson set them to music. As with the original &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;, authorship of each song on this album is explicitly credited to both Anderson and Bostock.

Composer Richard Harvey has covered &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; in the special compilation &quot;The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra Plays Prog Rock Classics&quot;.

<text>Aqualung is the fourth studio album by the English rock band Jethro Tull; it was released in March 1971 by Chrysalis Records. Though it is generally regarded as a concept album, featuring a central theme of &quot;the distinction between religion and God&quot;, the band said that there was no intention to make a concept album, and that only a few songs have a unifying theme. &quot;Aqualung&quot; success signalled a turning point in the career of the band, which went on to become a major radio and touring act.

Recorded at Island Records&#x27; new recording studio in Basing Street, London, it was their first album with keyboardist John Evan as a full-time member, their first with new bassist Jeffrey Hammond, and last album featuring Clive Bunker on drums, who left the band shortly after the release of the album. The album utilises more acoustic material than previous releases; and—inspired by photographs of homeless people on the Thames Embankment taken by singer Ian Anderson&#x27;s wife Jennie Franks—contains a number of recurring themes, addressing religion along with Anderson&#x27;s own personal experiences.

&quot;Aqualung&quot; is Jethro Tull&#x27;s best-selling album, selling more than seven million units worldwide. It was generally well-received critically and has been included on several music magazine best-of lists. The album spawned two singles, &quot;Hymn 43&quot; and &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot;.

==Production==

An early version of &quot;My God&quot; was recorded on 11–12 April 1970, followed by &quot;Wond&#x27;ring Aloud, Again&quot; on 21 June, both at Morgan Studios. After an American tour, bass player Glenn Cornick was fired from the band, and was replaced with Jeffrey Hammond, an old friend of Ian Anderson. &quot;Aqualung&quot; would be Hammond&#x27;s first album with the band. It would also mark the first time John Evan had recorded a full album with the band, as his only prior involvement was to provide several keyboard parts on the previous 1970 album, &quot;Benefit&quot;. In December, the album became one of the first to be recorded at Island Records&#x27; newly-opened recording studios on Basing Street in London. Led Zeppelin did some recording for &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; at the same time, though in the smaller of the two studios in the converted chapel. In an interview on the 25th anniversary edition of the album, Tull&#x27;s bandleader Ian Anderson said that trying to record in the larger studio was very difficult, because of its &quot;horrible, cold, echoey&quot; feel. The orchestral segments were arranged by Dee Palmer, who had worked with the band since 1968&#x27;s &quot;This Was&quot;, and would later join as a keyboard player. The master reels were assembled at Apple Studios on 2 March 1971. &quot;Aqualung&quot; would be the last Jethro Tull album to include Clive Bunker as a band member, as he retired shortly after recording to start a family.

==Musical style==

The songs on the album encompass a variety of musical genres, with elements of folk, blues, psychedelia, and hard rock. The &quot;riff-heavy&quot; nature of tracks such as &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot;, &quot;Hymn 43&quot; and &quot;Wind Up&quot; is regarded as a factor in the band&#x27;s increased success after the release of the album, with Jethro Tull becoming &quot;a major arena act&quot; and a &quot;fixture on FM radio&quot; according to AllMusic. In a stylistic departure from Jethro Tull&#x27;s earlier albums, many of &quot;Aqualung&quot;&#x27;s songs are acoustic. &quot;Cheap Day Return&quot;, &quot;Wond&#x27;ring Aloud&quot; and &quot;Slipstream&quot; are short, completely acoustic &quot;bridges&quot;, and &quot;Mother Goose&quot; is also mostly acoustic. Anderson claims his main inspirations for writing the album were Roy Harper and Bert Jansch.

==Themes==

&quot;Aqualung&quot; has generally been regarded as a concept album with a central theme of &quot;the distinction between religion and God&quot;. The album&#x27;s &quot;dour musings on faith and religion&quot; have marked it as &quot;one of the most cerebral albums ever to reach millions of rock listeners&quot;. Academic discussions of the nature of concept albums have frequently listed &quot;Aqualung&quot; amongst their number.

The initial idea for the album was sparked by some photographs that Anderson&#x27;s wife Jennie took of homeless people on the Thames Embankment. The appearance of one man in particular caught the interest of the couple, who together wrote the title song &quot;Aqualung&quot;. The first side of the LP, titled &quot;Aqualung&quot;, contains several character sketches, including the character of the title track, and the schoolgirl prostitute Cross-Eyed Mary, as well as two autobiographical tracks, including &quot;Cheap Day Return&quot;, written by Anderson after a visit to his critically ill father.

The second side, titled &quot;My God&quot;, contains three tracks—&quot;My God,&quot; &quot;Hymn 43&quot; and &quot;Wind-Up&quot;—that address religion in an introspective, and sometimes irreverent, manner. However, despite the names given to the album&#x27;s two sides and their related subject matter, Anderson has consistently maintained that &quot;Aqualung&quot; is not a &quot;concept album&quot;. A 2005 interview included on &quot;Aqualung Live&quot; gives Anderson&#x27;s thoughts on the matter:

Drummer Clive Bunker believes that the record&#x27;s perception as a concept album is a case of &quot;Chinese whispers&quot;, explaining &quot;you play the record to a couple of Americans, tell them that there&#x27;s a lyrical theme loosely linking a few songs, and then notice the figure of the Aqualung character on the cover, and suddenly the word is out that Jethro Tull have done a concept album&quot;.

The thematic elements Jethro Tull explored on the album—those of the effects of urbanisation on nature, and of the effects of social constructs such as religion on society—would be developed further on most of the band&#x27;s subsequent releases. Ian Anderson&#x27;s frustration over the album&#x27;s labelling as a concept album directly led to the creation of &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; (1972), intended to be a deliberately &quot;over the top&quot; concept album in response.

===Other songs===
&quot;Lick Your Fingers Clean&quot; was recorded for &quot;Aqualung&quot;, but was not included on the album. The song was drastically re-worked as &quot;Two Fingers&quot; for Tull&#x27;s 1974 album, &quot;War Child&quot;. &quot;Lick Your Fingers Clean&quot; was eventually released in 1988 on the &quot;20 Years of Jethro Tull&quot; collection. It was then released as a bonus track on the 1996 and 2011 reissues of &quot;Aqualung&quot;.

Another song, &quot;Wond&#x27;ring Again&quot; was recorded on 21 June 1970 together with the original version of &quot;Wond&#x27;ring Aloud&quot; (included as one single seven-minute song on the Steven Wilson remaster of associated recordings 1970–1971, titled &quot;Wond&#x27;ring Aloud, Again&quot;), and was considered for release on the album before Anderson decided to drop it from the final track listing. &quot;Wond&#x27;ring Again&quot; was subsequently released on the compilation album, &quot;Living in the Past&quot;, in 1972. A re-recording of &quot;Wond&#x27;ring Aloud&quot; was included on &quot;Aqualung&quot;. Glenn Cornick played bass on the song and says it is his favourite song he recorded with the band. Cornick also played bass on early studio recordings of &quot;My God&quot; and &quot;a couple of other songs&quot;, though he did not say which they were.

==Album cover==

The album&#x27;s original cover art by Burton Silverman features a watercolour portrait of a long-haired, bearded man in shabby clothes. The idea for the cover came from a photograph Anderson&#x27;s wife took of a homeless man on Thames Embankment, and Anderson later felt it would have been better to have used the photograph rather than commission the painting. Ian Anderson recalls posing for a photograph for the painting, though Silverman claims it was a self-portrait.

The artwork was commissioned and purchased by Chrysalis Records head Terry Ellis in 1971. Silverman was paid a flat fee of $1,500 for the painting. There was no written contract. The artist says the art was only licensed for use as an album cover, and not for merchandising; he approached the band seeking remuneration for the additional uses, such as printing it on T-shirts and coffee mugs.

The original artwork for both the front and back covers are missing. They were apparently stolen from a London hotel room, or perhaps from Chrysalis&#x27; office during a robbery. The original artwork for the interior gatefold painting was not taken during the robbery and is held by Terry Ellis.

==Release==

In April 1971, &quot;Aqualung&quot; peaked at number four on the UK Album Chart; when the CD version was released in 1996, it reached number 52. It peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard&#x27;s North American pop albums chart; the single &quot;Hymn 43&quot; hit No. 91 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The album went on to sell over seven million copies, and is the band&#x27;s best-selling album. &quot;Aqualung&quot; was one of Jethro Tull&#x27;s albums that were released in quadraphonic sound. The quadraphonic version of &quot;Wind Up&quot;, which is in a slightly higher key, is included on a later CD reissue of the album as &quot;Wind Up (quad version)&quot;.

The single &quot;Hymn 43&quot; was released on 14 August 1971, and reached number 91 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts, spending two weeks in the chart. The song was the first single to chart by the band in the United States. It was later included in the video game &quot;Rock Band 2&quot; as downloadable content; which also featured the album&#x27;s title track.

The album was re-released in a 40th anniversary edition on 31 October 2011. The release contains a new stereo and 5.1 surround remix of the album by British musician and producer Steven Wilson, the original quadraphonic mix, and comes in three different editions—a &quot;collector&#x27;s edition&quot; containing the album on LP and two CDs, as well a DVD and a Blu-ray disc (with better sound quality than the DVD) and a hardback book; a &quot;special edition&quot; containing the two CDs and an abridged version of the book; and an &quot;adapted edition&quot; containing two CDs (with 2 extra songs not included in the other two 40th anniversary editions) and 2 DVDs in a hardcover book (written content is the same as in the Collector&#x27;s Edition book, only the Chronology differs slightly). Justifying the remix, Steven Wilson said: &quot;Jethro Tull&#x27;s &quot;Aqualung&quot; is ... a masterpiece, but was sonically a very poor-sounding record. So, some didn&#x27;t rate it as highly as they should have. What we did with &quot;Aqualung&quot; was really make that record gleam in a way it never gleamed before. I think a lot of people, including myself, have come around to thinking that the album is a lot better than they even gave it credit for previously. So, there is certainly something very gratifying about being able to polish what was already a diamond and making it shine in a way it never has before&quot;. Additionally, according to mastering engineer Steve Hoffman there were tape stretching problems with the original session mixdown master, implying that many editions of the album used multigeneration copies as their source.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Aqualung&quot; received mixed to favourable reviews from contemporary music critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ben Gerson lauded its &quot;fine musicianship&quot;, calling it &quot;serious and intelligent&quot;, although he felt that the album&#x27;s seriousness &quot;undermined&quot; its quality. &quot;Sounds&quot; said that its &quot;taste and variety&quot; made it the band&#x27;s &quot;finest&quot; work. &quot;Aqualung&quot; was voted the 22nd best album of 1971 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. Robert Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator, was more critical of the album in a 1981 review, and described Anderson&#x27;s undeveloped cultural interests and negative views on religion and human behaviour as both boring and pretentious.

In retrospective reviews the album is generally lauded and viewed as a classic. AllMusic&#x27;s Bruce Eder called &quot;Aqualung&quot; &quot;a bold statement&quot; and &quot;extremely profound&quot;. In a review of the album&#x27;s 40th anniversary re-release, Sean Murphy of PopMatters said that &quot;Aqualung&quot; &quot;is, to be certain, a cornerstone of the then-nascent prog-rock canon, but it did—and does—exist wholly on its own terms as a great rock album, period.&quot; Murphy also praised the additional material featured on the release, finding that the new content was &quot;where a great album gets even better&quot;. Paul Stump&#x27;s &quot;History of Progressive Rock&quot; was more measured in its praise, saying that &quot;Aqualung&quot; made little advancement over the group&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Benefit&quot;. He identified the improvements as the deeper, wider arrangements, and the diversions of the melody from the bassline accompaniments. He found the side two song cycle rambling but added that &quot;if the lyrics were now tending towards the provocatively obscure, they were none the less possessed of some style, not least in their Blakean allusions&quot;. Steve Harris, the bass player for the heavy metal band Iron Maiden, has called &quot;Aqualung&quot; &quot;a classic album&quot;, lauding its &quot;fantastic playing, fantastic songs, attitude [and] vibe&quot;. Iron Maiden would go on to cover &quot;Cross-Eyed Mary&quot; as the B-side of their 1983 single &quot;The Trooper&quot;.

===Accolades===
&quot;Aqualung&quot; has also been appraised highly in retrospective listings, compiled by music writers and magazines. Martin Barre&#x27;s solo on the album&#x27;s title track was included in &quot;Guitarist&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 20 Greatest Guitar Solos of All Time&quot; at number 20.

==Track listing==

===Vinyl release (1971)===

Original North American Reprise Records pressings of &quot;Aqualung&quot; contained a slightly edited version of the title song, with its first three seconds (i.e., the first utterance of the song&#x27;s signature riff) removed. These pressings correspondingly list the song&#x27;s length at 6:31.

===CD issue (1996)===
===40th anniversary special edition (2011) ===

The 2011 version was remixed by Steven Wilson and remastered by Peter Mew.

CD 1: Original Album
===40th anniversary adapted edition: Remixed and mastered by Steven Wilson (2016)===
The 2016 edition was remastered by Steven Wilson of his 2011 remixed material as he did not like Peter Mew&#x27;s mastering. 

===Aqualung Live (2005)===
&quot;Aqualung Live&quot; is a live album of a performance of &quot;Aqualung&quot; before an audience of 40 invited guests at XM Studios in Washington, D.C., on 23 November 2004. It was released in the UK in September 2005 by RandM Records. In the US, the album was given away to ticket holders on almost all US concerts in October and November 2005, before being given an official release on 7 March 2006. Royalties from the European release went to various charities for the homeless.

<text>The Offshore Patrol (OSP) also known as the Mosquito Fleet was a small naval branch of the United States Army, intended for inshore defense of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. It was active from February 9, 1939 to June 30, 1946. The OSP became part of the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) on July 26, 1941, with General Douglas MacArthur as Commander. During the Japanese invasion of the Philippines, the Patrol engaged in limited naval operations along the coastlines of Bataan and Corregidor, against the tight enemy blockade, to bring much-needed provisions to the beleaguered Filipino and American troops during the battle. Undaunted by enemy superiority, the ubiquitous patrol boats fought with zeal, courage and heroism, hitting Japanese warships with torpedoes when given the opportunity. The unit relied on speed and surprise to attack larger vessels at close range.

During the course of the war, the unit was cited for gallantry by General MacArthur for actions against three of nine Japanese dive bombers going to attack shore installations in Bataan.

After World War II, the OSP continued until June 30, 1946, dissolving concurrently with the USAFFE in the lead-up to the Philippines&#x27;s independence. The OSP was transformed into the Philippine Naval Patrol (PNP). This small unit was the first independent Philippine naval force that fully understood the doctrine of naval warfare. The OSP&#x27;s veterans eventually became the nucleus that shaped the beginnings of the modern Philippine Navy.

== History ==

The OSP was called for by the Philippine National Assembly in its National Defense Act of 1935 that Offshore Patrol on 11 January 1936. Its guidelines were defined by Executive Order No. 11 as follows: &quot;The Off-Shore Patrol shall comprise all marine equipment and personnel acquired by the Philippine Government and assigned either in peace or war to the control of the Chief of Staff (PA). It shall have such duties and powers as may be described by the Chief of Staff, PA.&quot;

This act called for the creation, by 1946, of a force of thirty-six fast torpedo boats (PT) as part of the Philippine Army. These were to be British-designed torpedo boats, with a speed of forty-one knots; they were to be armed with two torpedo tubes and built by British shipbuilders. Only two of the boats were delivered by 1939, at which point the war in Europe curtailed any further supply. By October 1941, a third torpedo boat had been assembled locally. The squadron was attached to United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), which had assumed overall control of military forces in the Philippines; and added two additional patrol boats (non-torpedo).

The first commanding OSP officer was Major Rafael Ramos, a Philippine Nautical School (PNS) graduate known to Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon on April 15, 1938. Ramos was the first chief to start recruiting OSP personnel. In June 1938, he was relieved by Captain Jose V. Andrada, a United States Naval Academy graduate (Class of 1930), who originally assisted Ramos but was determined to be better qualified. Major Ramos was sent to the United States to study at Quartermaster School. He was supported by other Annapolis graduates, among them: Lt. Alfredo Pecson (USNA 1933) as Executive Officer, Lt. Rafael Pargas (USNA 1935), and Lt. Marcelo Castillo (USNA 1938). The OSP was later joined by Lt. Enrique L. Jurado (USNA 1934) as Base Commander, and Lt. Carlos Albert (USNA 1938) as instructors.

Shortly after his appointment, Capt. Andrada announced his volunteer recruiting program and began personally interviewing interested candidates. By the end of 1938, USNA graduates: Lt. Alfredo Peckson (1933), Lt. Marcelo Castillo (1938); PMA graduates: Lieutenants Nestor Reinoso (1934), Alberto Navarette (1935), Simeon Castro (1935), Juan Maglayan (1937), Alfonso Palencia (1938), Santiago Nuval (1938), Emilio Liwanag (1938), nine officers, and twenty-five enlisted men had joined the OSP. They were all trained on seamanship, navigation and gunnery in sessions that were conducted with the USNA graduates as instructors at OSP headquarters in Muelle del Codo, Port Area, Manila. On February 9, 1939, the first OSP class graduated; Capt. Andrada marked it as the birth date of the Offshore Patrol.

On December 4, 1941, Captain Enrique L. “Henry” Jurado (1911 – Oct. 19, 1944), a USNA graduate (Class of &#x27;34), became the officer-in-command of the OSP, just before the Pearl Harbor attack. Jurado took over as OSP Commander as Capt. Andrada became Commander of the Coast Artillery Battalion, Fort Wint, Corregidor.

The OSP was a close-knit unit composed of men in their late teens or twenties, more than sixty men overall. They were divided into two main groups: shore and sea duty.

== Offshore Patrol torpedo boat designs ==

The PT-boats of the Offshore Patrol were to be , with a beam. They were to have three 12-cylinder engines, and a speed of . Their armament was to consist of two 21in (533 mm) torpedo, depth charges, and light antiaircraft guns.

US Military Advisor to the Commonwealth of the Philippines General Douglas MacArthur states, &quot;A small fleet of such vessels will have distinct effect in compelling any hostile force to approach cautiously.&quot;

== Torpedo and patrol boats of the Offshore Patrol ==
The Offshore Patrol craft were berthed at &quot;Muele del Codo&quot; (Engineer Island) in Manila&#x27;s Port Area. During the Japanese campaign against Bataan they operated out of Sisiman Bay. The American navy PT boats, Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three, under Lt. Bulkeley were also in the same bay but alongside the requisitioned tug &quot;Trabajador&quot; serving as a tender.
The squadron consisted of five boats:
*3 Torpedo boats
** PT &quot;Q-111 Luzon&quot; - commanded by Captain Alberto Navarette
** PT &quot;Q-112 Abra&quot; - Lieutenant Ramon A. Alcaraz
** PT &quot;Q-113 Agusan&quot; - Lieutenant Santiago Nuval
*2 Motor launches put into service at Bataan.
** PB Q-114 &quot;Danday&quot; - Lieutenant Abraham Campo
** PB &quot;Q-115 Baler&quot; - Lieutenant Carlos Albert

<text>Heavy Horses is the eleventh studio album by British progressive rock band Jethro Tull, released on 10 April 1978.

The album is often considered the second in a trio of folk rock albums released by the band at the end of the 1970s, alongside &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; (1977) and &quot;Stormwatch&quot; (1979). In contrast to the British folklore-inspired lyrical content found on &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot;, &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; adopts a more realist and earthly perspective of country living; further, the album (and its title track) are dedicated to the &quot;indigenous working ponies and horses of Great Britain&quot;. Musically, the album sees the band continuing the combination of folk and progressive rock found on &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot;, although with an overall darker and more sober sound fitting the changed lyrical content.

==Recording==
&quot;Heavy Horses&quot; was the first album recorded by Jethro Tull at the newly constructed Maison Rouge studio in Fulham, London, a custom built recording studio which was funded and owned by Ian Anderson. Much of the album was recorded at night, as Anderson felt that daytime hours at the studio needed to be left open for potential business clients. Keyboardist Dee Palmer recalled her diary entries at the time of recording as saying that &quot;I&#x27;d start at 7pm and go home at 7am!&quot; &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; was the first album on which Anderson began to experience vocal issues, the beginning of an affliction which would become more serious in the 1980s and later develop into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Anderson&#x27;s vocals sound more nasal and gruff on some of the album&#x27;s tracks as a result, particularly on the title track.

As with the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot;, other members of the band beyond just Anderson were involved in writing music for the album, with guitarist Martin Barre writing portions of the title track and &quot;No Lullaby&quot; and Palmer writing string arrangements for most of the album as well as the instrumental bridge of &quot;...And the Mouse Police Never Sleeps&quot;. Darryl Way of Curved Air guests on the album, playing violin on the title track and &quot;Acres Wild&quot;.

Several songs were recorded but then abandoned or otherwise cut from the album during the recording sessions, including the B-side &quot;Beltane&quot;, a completely finished song titled &quot;Everything in Our Lives&quot; and an early acoustic version of &quot;Jack-a-Lynn&quot;, a song which would later be re-recorded during sessions for the band&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;The Broadsword and the Beast&quot;. Many of the unreleased songs recorded during the album&#x27;s sessions were later released on the &quot;20 Years of Jethro Tull&quot; anniversary compilation in 1988 and the 40th anniversary &quot;New Shoes&quot; edition of the album in 2018. Upon remixing of the album for the 40th anniversary edition, it was discovered that the original masters of &quot;Moths&quot; and &quot;Rover&quot; were slightly sharp, likely as a result of a faulty tape machine. The remixed versions of the tracks included on the re-release of the album were slightly pitched down to correct this.

==Musical style and themes==
While continuing the folk rock style of &quot;Songs From the Wood&quot;, &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; sees a tonal shift into more earthly and realist themes of country living, compared with the fantasy and mythology of the previous album. Anderson was again inspired by daily life at his recently purchased country estate in Buckinghamshire, saying that &quot;I was living in the same house in the same place, and getting a bit more involved in farming and other rural stuff... so the horse-hoeing husbandry of the original Jethro Tull era was in the back of my mind.&quot; Several of the album&#x27;s songs were directly inspired by Anderson&#x27;s personal life at the estate: &quot;...And the Mouse Police Never Sleeps&quot; was partially inspired by his cat Mistletoe, &quot;No Lullaby&quot; was written as an &quot;anti-lullaby&quot; for his son and &quot;Rover&quot; was partially inspired by his dog Lupus. Other songs on the album such as &quot;Weathercock&quot; and the title track paint a cold and practical picture of country living, with the latter track described by Anderson as &quot;a lament for the passing as working animals of those magnificent beasts, the heavy farm horses.&quot; Other track&#x27;s lyrics were inspired by literature, such as &quot;One Brown Mouse&quot; inspired by the Robert Burns poem &quot;To a Mouse&quot; and &quot;Moths&quot; inspired by the John le Carré novel &quot;The Naïve and Sentimental Lover&quot;.

Anderson stated that the recording of the album came at a time when other artists were moving towards the new trends in music, and the band decided they did not want &quot;to appear as if we were trying to slip into the post-punk coattails that were worn by The Stranglers or The Police.&quot;

==Reception==

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s contemporary review was positive, calling the instrumental arrangements lavish and stating that &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; and the folk genre, as a follow-up to &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot;, suited Jethro Tull perfectly. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; thought that the band was coasting, but praised &quot;Anderson&#x27;s enigmatic writing style and his one-of-a-kind voice&quot;.

AllMusic calls &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; one of the prettiest records of the band, praising both Martin Barre&#x27;s and John Glascock&#x27;s playing as Robin Black engineering and the special participation of Curved Air violinist Darryl Way.

<doc id="161388" wikidata="Q6025125" url="?curid=161388" title="Indirect self-reference">
<text>Indirect self-reference describes an object referring to itself &quot;indirectly&quot;.

For example, define the function f such that f(x) = x(x). Any function passed as an argument to f is invoked with itself as an argument, and thus in any use of that argument is indirectly referring to itself.

This example is similar to the Scheme expression &quot;((lambda(x)(x x)) (lambda(x)(x x)))&quot;, which is expanded to itself by beta reduction, and so its evaluation loops indefinitely despite the lack of explicit looping constructs. An equivalent example can be formulated in lambda calculus.

Indirect self-reference is special in that its self-referential quality is not explicit, as it is in the sentence &quot;this sentence is false.&quot; The phrase &quot;this sentence&quot; refers directly to the sentence as a whole. An indirectly self-referential sentence would replace the phrase &quot;this sentence&quot; with an expression that effectively still referred to the sentence, but did not use the pronoun &quot;this.&quot;

An example will help to explain this. Suppose we define the quine of a phrase to be the quotation of the phrase followed by the phrase itself. So, the quine of:
 is a sentence fragment
would be:
 &quot;is a sentence fragment&quot; is a sentence fragment
which, incidentally, is a true statement.

Now consider the sentence:
 &quot;when quined, makes quite a statement&quot; when quined, makes quite a statement

The quotation here, plus the phrase &quot;when quined,&quot; indirectly refers to the entire sentence. The importance of this fact is that the remainder of the sentence, the phrase &quot;makes quite a statement,&quot; can now make a statement about the sentence as a whole. If we had used a pronoun for this, we could have written something like &quot;this sentence makes quite a statement.&quot;

It seems silly to go through this trouble when pronouns will suffice (and when they make more sense to the casual reader), but in systems of mathematical logic, there is generally no analog of the pronoun. It is somewhat surprising, in fact, that self-reference can be achieved at all in these systems.

Upon closer inspection, it can be seen that in fact, the Scheme example above uses a quine, and f is actually the quine function itself.

Indirect self-reference was studied in great depth by W. V. Quine (after whom the operation above is named), and occupies a central place in the proof of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem. Among the paradoxical statements developed by Quine is the following:

 &quot;yields a false statement when preceded by its quotation&quot; yields a false statement when preceded by its quotation

<doc id="161392" wikidata="Q300514" url="?curid=161392" title="A Passion Play">
<text>A Passion Play is the sixth studio album by British progressive rock band Jethro Tull, released in July 1973 in both the UK and US. Following in the same style as the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; (1972), &quot;A Passion Play&quot; is a concept album comprising individual songs arranged into a single continuous piece of music (which was split into two parts across the original vinyl release&#x27;s two sides). The album&#x27;s concept follows the spiritual journey of a recently deceased man (Ronnie Pilgrim) in the afterlife, exploring themes of morality, religion and good and evil. The album&#x27;s accompanying tour was considered the high water mark of Jethro Tull&#x27;s elaborate stage productions, involving a full performance of the album accompanied by physical props, sketches and projected video.

&quot;A Passion Play&quot; was negatively received by critics upon its initial release. However, the album was a commercial success, becoming Jethro Tull&#x27;s second number one album in the United States. The album has since received a more positive critical reassessment.

==Background==
Following the release of the critically and commercially successful &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; in 1972, Jethro Tull made the decision to record their next album at the Château d&#x27;Hérouville studios in Hérouville, France, known in the 1970s for being frequented by artists such as Pink Floyd, Elton John and T. Rex. The band were persuaded by their management and accountants to record their next album in tax exile outside of the UK in order to avoid what Anderson described as &quot;a pretty scary tax regime&quot; of the time. The band planned to make a double album, with concepts as varied as the meaning of life, music criticism and the comparison between the man and animal world.

Upon arrival at the Château, however, the band faced a variety of challenges which made the recording sessions difficult, ranging from technical issues with the studio equipment to bug-infested beds and food poisoning epidemics, causing Anderson to give the Château the nickname &quot;Château d&#x27;Isaster&quot; Although the band had recorded enough material to fill three sides of the intended double album, the issues living in the studio convinced the band to abandon the sessions and leave the Château. The band considered moving the album&#x27;s production to Switzerland, for they had just recently been granted Swiss citizenship; however, the decision was ultimately made to return to the UK and completely restart writing and recording of the album (although two tracks from the Château d&#x27;Hérouville sessions were later included on the band&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;War Child&quot;).

==Recording==
Upon returning to the UK, the band began sessions for &quot;A Passion Play&quot; at Morgan Studios, the same studio where they had recorded most of their last four albums. Anderson felt that &quot;it was better to start again and write a whole new album, instead of trying to somehow regenerate everybody&#x27;s interest and commitment to something that had already struggled&quot;, in reference to the abandoned Château sessions and the decision to start over with new material. The album was written and recorded quickly, as the band had little time before their next tour began. As a result, recording sessions were often lengthy, in some cases lasting all night. Guitarist Martin Barre recalled the sessions as being &quot;long&quot; and &quot;very intense&quot; with Anderson stating that the album needed to be &quot;written and recorded in one block, very quickly&quot;. The concept and most of the music were written in the studio by Anderson, with occasional contributions from other members of the band.

==Musical style==
Continuing the progressive rock style previously explored by the band on &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;, &quot;A Passion Play&quot; featured the band playing a multitude of instruments, heavily toned with dominating minor key variation, resulting in an album described by author Martin Webb as &quot;quasi prog-rock with complex time-signatures, complex lyrics and, well, complex everything, really&quot;. The spoken word piece &quot;The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles&quot;, has its relations in musical terms with Prokofiev’s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;. Bruce Eder describes Anderson&#x27;s singing in biblical-sounding references, interwoven with modern language as a sort of a rock equivalent to T.S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; with the music a &quot;dazzling mix of old English folk and classical material, reshaped in electric rock terms&quot;. The album is notable for heavily featuring soprano saxophone played by Anderson, often in place of his famous flute playing. Anderson expressed distaste for the instrument, saying that &quot;It wasn&#x27;t difficult to learn to play it a bit, but I didn&#x27;t practice enough, I wasn&#x27;t trained and it hurt my lip. I hated the fiddling about with reeds, the fact that it was all wet and soggy, straight off I really didn&#x27;t enjoy playing the instrument.&quot;

==Concept==

===Background===
&quot;A Passion Play&quot; borrows its title from passion plays which depict the Passion of Jesus Christ, though the title is evidently ironic, since the lyrics at first appears to present a generically Christian view of the afterlife but then rejects Christian theological conclusions. &quot;A Passion Play&quot; is described in its album liner notes as though it were a staged theatrical &quot;play&quot; in four acts. Of this album, &quot;the lyrics themselves are extremely complicated, the story is often unclear, and much is left to the individual&#x27;s interpretation&quot;. Knowledge of the characters and setting actually comes less from the lyrics themselves and more from the few brief words in the satirical, six-page &quot;Linwell Theatre programme&quot; included in the original album packaging, which features photos of the band members listed alongside fake names and biographies as the &quot;actors&quot; of the play, including Rena Sanderone (an anagram of &quot;Eean Anderrson&quot;) as the playwright. A basic narrative plot can be loosely interpreted from the lyrics, liner notes, and &quot;programme&quot; of &quot;A Passion Play&quot;, centering on everyman protagonist Ronnie Pilgrim, who is named only in the programme.

Anderson described his conceptual inspiration for &quot;A Passion Play&quot; as: 

===Plot synopsis===
Ronnie Pilgrim recognises his own death and, in ghostly form, attends his own funeral, before traversing a purgatorial desert and &quot;icy wastes&quot;, where he is visited by a smiling angel guide (Act 1). Pilgrim is next admitted into a video viewing room by a Peter Dejour, and events of Pilgrim&#x27;s life are replayed by a projectionist before a demanding jury. After a long-winded and bizarre evaluation process, the sardonic jury concludes that they &quot;won&#x27;t cross [Pilgrim] out&quot;, suggesting that he has led a mostly decent life and so will be admitted into Heaven, which corresponds with the sudden start of a cheerful &quot;Forest Dance&quot; melody (Act 2).

At this time, the main plot is interrupted by an unrelated, spoken-word comedic interlude (narrated by Jeffrey Hammond with an exaggerated Lancashire accent) backed by instrumentation. Presented as an absurd fable, the interlude details (with much wordplay) the failure of a group of anthropomorphic animals to help a hare find his missing eyeglasses.

The &quot;Forest Dance&quot; melody resumes, and Ronnie Pilgrim now appears in Heaven, two days after his judgment at the viewing room, communicating two unexpected thoughts: &quot;I&#x27;ll go to the foot of our stairs&quot; (an expression of surprise) and &quot;&quot; (an expression of scepticism about the fulfilment of a reward). Pilgrim&#x27;s dissatisfaction with Heaven appears to be linked to its mundane atmosphere where most of its residents endlessly reminisce, chronically obsessing over the living. Therefore, unable to adapt, Pilgrim goes to G. Oddie &amp; Son to frankly request a relocation to Hell, feeling that he has a &quot;right to be wrong&quot;. Descending into Hell, Pilgrim is confronted by Lucifer (named &quot;Lucy&quot; in the album&#x27;s fictitious programme), who asserts his cold authority as Pilgrim&#x27;s &quot;overseer&quot; (Act 3). Pilgrim immediately finds Hell even worse than Heaven and flees, understanding himself now as neither completely good nor evil, wishing that he could trade his &quot;halo for a horn and the horn for the hat I once had&quot;. He speaks with a Magus Perdé about his dilemma and, having sampled and rejected both extremes of his afterlife options, he finally stands on a Stygian shore as a &quot;voyager into life&quot;. On this beach, other people and animals also prepare to &quot;renew the pledge of life&#x27;s long song&quot;. The final triumphant lyrics include the phrases &quot;ever-burning fire&quot;, &quot;ever-door&quot;, &quot;ever-life&quot;, and moving &quot;from the dark into ever-day&quot;, so that the play concludes with a strong implication of eternal rebirth (Act 4).

==Reception==
Upon its original release, it received generally negative reviews. Stephen Holden, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, was broadly negative, saying that the album &quot;strangles under the tonnage of its pretensions — a jumble of anarchic, childishly precocious gestures that are intellectually and emotionally faithless to any idea other than their own esoteric non-logic&quot;; feeling, overall, that, despite the band being &quot;truly virtuosic in the manner of a polished chamber ensemble&quot; and some moments, such as &quot;those interludes that feature Anderson’s extraordinary flute playing&quot; and two &quot;short pastoral sections&quot; that were &quot;especially lovely&quot;, the album was &quot;expensive, tedious nonsense&quot;. &quot;New Musical Express&quot; considered the album as &quot;the fall&quot; of Jethro Tull. Even Chris Welch of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; had a bad impression, stating &quot;Music must touch the soul. &quot;A Passion Play&quot; rattles with emptiness&quot;. Lester Bangs, writing for &quot;Creem Magazine&quot;, stated that he became &quot;totally bamboozled&quot; after hearing the album. Bangs concluded: &quot;I almost like it, even though it sort of irritates me. Maybe I like it because it irritates me. But that&#x27;s my problem&quot;. &quot;Record World&quot; said that &quot;the music is expectedly rich and imaginative, if somewhat challenging.&quot;

Despite the reviews, &quot;A Passion Play&quot; sold well enough to reach No. 1 on the charts in the United States and Canada. The album also had good sales in Germany and Norway, where it reached No. 5. In the United Kingdom it reached No. 16. The 2013 box &quot;A Passion Play: an Extended Performance&quot; achieved the Nº 48 in the Top Rock Albums.

===Legacy===
Jethro Tull&#x27;s business manager, Terry Ellis, announced in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; that the band would retire from live performances in response to negative reviews of the album and concerts. This was just a publicity stunt of which the band had no knowledge; Anderson felt it made them look petulant and brought them the wrong sort of publicity.

A three-star retrospective review by Bruce Eder for &quot;AllMusic&quot; was gentle in its judgement, saying that &quot;the music puts it over successfully, a dazzling mix of old English folk and classical material, reshaped in electric rock terms. The band is at its peak form, sustaining the tension and anticipation of this album-length piece across 45 minutes, although the music runs out of inspiration about five minutes before it actually ends&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; ranked &quot;A Passion Play&quot; the 17th best progressive rock album of all time.

Paul Stump, in his &quot;History of Progressive Rock&quot;, said that &quot;the writing is militantly episodic&quot;, with some beautiful moments but an overemphasis on novelty and an overall incoherent sequence of themes that makes the album bemusing and disorienting rather than engaging to the listener.

Some members of the band, in retrospect, expressed distaste for the album, including Anderson, saying that &quot;I&#x27;ve always thought that &quot;A Passion Play&quot; suffered more than any other album I&#x27;ve ever made from being over-arranged and over-produced and over-cooked&quot; and that Jethro Tull fans who call the album their favourite album of all time &quot;should of course remain in the establishment for the criminally insane in which they probably already reside&quot;. Barre has said that he believes that the album exists in &quot;the bottom third of Jethro Tull albums&quot;.

==Releases==
Subsequent to the original 1973 release, the album was released on CD. Later, in March 1998 Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab released a CD, which indexed tracks along the lines of, but not quite matching, the radio-station promo (see below) and in 2003 a remastered CD version with an additional video track was released.

On the original release of the album, side one ends in the middle of &quot;The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles&quot; (it is the same end on track 1 of the original CD release). The sound at the end of side one was a nod to children storytelling records which signalled the child or parent to flip the record over. Side two begins where it left off. However, on the 2003 remastered CD, the second part begins with the full story so that it does not get cut off in the middle.

In 2014, commemorating the 40th anniversary (slightly belated) of the album, it was released a box called &quot;A Passion Play: An Extended Performance&quot;, which contains the complete Chateau d’Herouville sessions and brand-new mix by Steven Wilson. This version also includes an additional verse not on the original release of &quot;The Foot Of Our Stairs&quot;. It extends the track about another 45 seconds. The DVDs also include the video clips of stage intro film and &quot;The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles&quot;. The discs are packaged in a box set along with a book featuring interviews with Wilson, dancer Jane Eve, spun man Chris Amson, plus the memoirs of the Reverend Godfrey Pilchard.

===Chateau D&#x27;Isaster recordings===
Early concepts for the album were developed at the recording studio Château d&#x27;Hérouville, which the band, due to difficulties at the studio, playfully referred to as &quot;Chateau D&#x27;Isaster&quot;. Previously unreleased recordings from these sessions were first offered to public under the title &quot;The Chateau D&#x27;Isaster Tapes&quot; on the 1988 compilation &quot;20 Years of Jethro Tull&quot; (three recordings) and then in the 1993 compilation &quot;Nightcap: The Unreleased Masters 1973–1991&quot;. &quot;Nightcap&quot; included almost all the recordings with additional flute solos by Ian Anderson.

The full recordings were released in 2014, in the box &quot;A Passion Play: An Extended Performance&quot;. The box contains previously unreleased tracks such as &quot;Sailor&quot; and &quot;The Big Top&quot; along with the aforementioned &quot;Skating Away&quot; and &quot;Critique Oblique&quot;.

==Track listing==
These titles were provided by Anderson for the 1973 DJ pressing of the LP, though they were not included for the standard pressing. The gold Ultradisc Original Master Recording CD of Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (1998) contains cueable tracks for each title, but the standard CD releases contain only one or two tracks, depending on the version. 

All songs written by Ian Anderson unless stated otherwise.

<doc id="161393" wikidata="Q254060" url="?curid=161393" title="Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois">
<text>Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois (Charlotte Louise Juliette Grimaldi; 30 September 1898 – 16 November 1977), styled Hereditary Princess of Monaco between 1922 and 1944, was the daughter of Louis II, Prince of Monaco, and mother of Prince Rainier III. From 1922 until 1944, she was the Hereditary Princess of Monaco, heiress presumptive to the throne.

==Birth and adoption==
Born Charlotte Louise Juliette de Monaco in Constantine, French Algeria, she was the illegitimate daughter of Marie Juliette Louvet, a cabaret singer, and Louis, Hereditary Prince of Monaco and Duke of Valentinois, son and heir of Monaco&#x27;s reigning monarch, Prince Albert I. Louis had no legitimate children or siblings, so even before he succeeded his father as Prince Louis II, the principality sought to forestall a succession crisis, anticipating that its neighbour, the French Republic, might take it amiss if the throne fell someday to Louis&#x27; legal next of kin. That heir was his cousin, Wilhelm, 2nd Duke of Urach, who, although born and raised in Monte Carlo as the son of Princess Florestine of Monaco, was a German subject, property owner and patrilineal relative of the kings of Württemberg. On 15 May 1911, a law was passed recognising Charlotte as Louis&#x27; daughter, and declaring her to be a dynastic member of the sovereign family. Though this act was later held to be invalid under the 1882 statutes, an Ordinance of 30 October 1918 was passed to allow her to be adopted into the dynasty instead. Louis adopted Charlotte in Paris on 16 May 1919, thereby entitling her to the surname Grimaldi, while her grandfather bestowed upon her the traditional title of the Principality&#x27;s heir, Duchess of Valentinois, for life. Charlotte became heir presumptive to the throne as Hereditary Princess when her grandfather died and her father inherited the princely crown in 1922.

==Legality of adoption==
A shadow of doubt existed over the legality of this adoption. The Monegasque Civil Code (Articles 240 and 243) required that the adopting party be at least of age 50 and the adoptee 21. The 1918 Ordinance changed the age limit to 18 (Charlotte was twenty at the time) but not the other age limit; Louis was then only 48.

==Marriage==
In Monaco, civilly on 18 March and religiously on 19 March 1920, Louis arranged Charlotte&#x27;s marriage to the then Count Pierre de Polignac of Hennebont, Morbihan, Brittany, France, who, by the Prince&#x27;s ordinance, took the surname Grimaldi and became a prince of the Monegasque princely family. The couple had two children:

* Princess Antoinette Louise Alberte Suzanne (28 December 1920 – 18 March 2011).
* Rainier III, Prince of Monaco (31 May 1923 – 6 April 2005).

Their marriage was not, however, a happy one; they separated on 20 March 1930 due to his homosexuality, and Charlotte left him to live with her doctor and Italian lover, Dalmazzo. The couple were divorced on 18 February 1933 by ordinance of Prince Louis II.

==Later life==
On 30 May 1944, the day before her son&#x27;s 21st birthday and in full agreement with her father, Charlotte renounced and ceded her rights to the throne to her son Rainier, subject to the stipulation that he not predecease her. From this date, she was no longer Hereditary Princess of Monaco, though she retained the title Princess Charlotte of Monaco.

Late in life she went to college, obtaining a degree in social work. After her son assumed the throne (in 1949), Princess Charlotte moved to live at Château de Marchais, the Grimaldi estate outside Paris. Despite the objections of her children who feared for her safety, she turned the estate into a rehabilitation centre for ex-convicts. She lived at the estate with her lover, a noted French former jewel thief named René Girier and nicknamed &quot;René la Canne&quot; (René the Cane).

She died on 16 November 1977 in Paris.

<text>Los Lobos (, Spanish for &quot;the Wolves&quot;) is a Mexican American rock group, rock band from East Los Angeles, California. Their music is influenced by rock and roll, Tex-Mex, country, zydeco, folk, R&amp;B, blues, brown-eyed soul, and traditional music such as cumbia, boleros and norteños. The band rose to international stardom in 1987, when their version of &quot;La Bamba&quot; peaked at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and also topped the charts in the United Kingdom, and several other countries. Songs by Los Lobos have been recorded by Elvis Costello, Waylon Jennings, Frankie Yankovic, and Robert Plant. In 2015, they were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2018, they were inducted into the &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; Hall of Fame. They are also known for performing the theme song for &quot;Handy Manny&quot;. As of 2024, they have been nominated for twelve Grammy Awards and have won four.

==History==

===1973–79: Formation and early releases===
Vocalist and guitarist David Hidalgo and drummer Louie Pérez met at Garfield High School in East Los Angeles, California, and bonded over their mutual affinity for musical acts such as Fairport Convention, Randy Newman and Ry Cooder. Pérez recalls, &quot;We&#x27;re looking at each other, &#x27;You like this stuff? I thought I was the only weird one.&#x27; So I went over to his house one day for about a year, which we spent listening to records, playing guitars, and starting to write songs.&quot; The two borrowed reel-to-reel recorders from a friend and created multitrack recordings of music spanning from parody songs to free-form jazz. They later enlisted fellow students Frank González, Cesar Rosas and Conrad Lozano to complete the group&#x27;s lineup, in 1973. Their first album, &quot;Los Lobos del Este de Los Angeles&quot;, was recorded at two studios in Hollywood in 1977 over a period of about four months. At that time, they all had regular jobs, and it was hard to get together for the sessions. To accommodate that situation, their producer Luis Torres would call the engineer, Mark Fleisher, who owned and operated a high-speed tape duplicating studio in Hollywood, to find a studio when he knew all the band members could get off work that night. Most of the songs were recorded at a studio on Melrose Avenue, located next to the Paramount studios at the time, and a low-priced studio on Sunset Boulevard.

The band members were unsatisfied with playing only American Top 40 songs and began experimenting with the traditional Mexican music they listened to as children. This style of music received a positive reaction from audiences, leading the band to switch genres, performing at hundreds of weddings and dances between 1974 and 1980. &quot;If you were married between 1973 and 1980 in East L.A., we probably played your wedding,&quot; said Louie Perez. &quot;They would pay us like $400 for the four of us, a case of beer, and all the mole we could eat...&quot; said David Hidalgo. However, Los Lobos took notice of the popular groups on the Hollywood music scene and added influences of rock to its sound.

Originally, they called themselves Los Lobos del Este (de Los Angeles), which translates to The Wolves of the East (of Los Angeles), a play on the name of the norteño band Los Tigres del Norte. There was another conjunto band at the time named &quot;Los Lobos Del Norte&quot;, which had released several albums already. The name was quickly shortened to Los Lobos.

===1980–88: &quot;How Will the Wolf Survive?&quot; and commercial success===
The band&#x27;s first noteworthy public appearance occurred in 1980 at the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles, when they were hired by David Ferguson and CD Presents to open for Public Image Ltd. On September 28, 1983, the band released an extended play entitled &quot;...And a Time to Dance&quot;, which was well received by critics but sold only about 50,000 copies. Slash Records/Warner Bros Records was not confident enough in Los Lobos to release a standard 10-song LP. So they released a 7-song debut LP. Seven months after the release, the group won a Grammy Award for Best Mexican American Song in 1984 However, the sales of the EP earned the group enough money to purchase a Dodge van, enabling the band to tour throughout the United States for the first time. Los Lobos returned to the studio in the summer of 1984 to record its first major-label album, &quot;How Will the Wolf Survive?&quot; The album&#x27;s title and the title song were inspired by a &quot;National Geographic&quot; article entitled &quot;Where Can the Wolf Survive,&quot; which the band members related to their own struggle to gain success in the United States while maintaining their Mexican roots.

Los Lobos were exposed to Rock and Roll audiences when they opened for The Clash, a punk group, and they later opened for a Los Angeles band the Blasters, with influences in rhythm and blues and rockabilly. Steve Berlin, who was born in Philadelphia, played saxophone for the Blasters then left the group to join Los Lobos. When he joined the band, Berlin spoke about his similar record collection to the other members of Los Lobos, where they shared loves for George Jones and Hank Williams.

The film &quot;Colors&quot; includes &quot;One Time, One Night&quot; in the opening credits, although the song was not included on the soundtrack album. In 1986, members of Los Lobos appeared alongside Tomata du Plenty in the punk rock musical &quot;&quot;. In 1987, they released a second album, &quot;By the Light of the Moon&quot;. In the same year, they recorded some Ritchie Valens covers for the soundtrack of the film &quot;La Bamba&quot;, including the title track, which became a number one single for the band plus &quot;Come On Let&#x27;s Go&quot; and &quot;Donna&quot; which also charted.
In 1988, they followed with another album, &quot;La pistola y el corazón&quot;, featuring original and traditional Mexican songs. The album never peaked above #189 in the pop charts, but it did garner Los Lobos their second Grammy Award for Best Mexican American Album in 1990. Also in 1988 they contributed their cover of &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)&quot;, to the Disney tribute album &quot;Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films&quot;.

===1988–94: &quot;The Neighborhood&quot; and &quot;Kiko&quot;===
In the late 1980s and early 1990s the band toured extensively throughout the world, opening for such acts as Bob Dylan, U2 and the Grateful Dead.

Los Lobos returned with &quot;The Neighborhood&quot; in 1990, and the more experimental &quot;Kiko&quot; (produced by Mitchell Froom) in 1992. &quot;Kiko&quot; sold more units (over 400,000 sold) than the previous two albums and was voted &#x27;Album of the year&#x27; by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;. The band contributed a lively cover of &quot;Bertha&quot;, a song which they often performed live, to the Grateful Dead tribute–rain forest benefit album &quot;Deadicated.&quot; In 1994 they also contributed a track, &quot;Down Where the Drunkards Roll&quot;, to the Richard Thompson tribute album &quot;Beat the Retreat&quot;.

On the band&#x27;s twentieth anniversary in 1993, they released a two-CD collection of singles, outtakes, live recordings and hits, entitled &quot;Just Another Band from East L.A.&quot;

===1995–98: &quot;Papa&#x27;s Dream&quot; and &quot;Colossal Head&quot;===
In 1995, Los Lobos released the prestigious and bestselling record &quot;Papa&#x27;s Dream&quot; on Music for Little People Records along with veteran guitarist and singer Lalo Guerrero. The album garnered a Grammy nomination for Best Children&#x27;s Album. The band also scored the film &quot;Desperado&quot;. The album track &quot;Mariachi Suite&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance and was their 3rd Grammy Award.

In 1996, they released &quot;Colossal Head&quot;. In spite of the fact that the album was critically acclaimed, Warner Brothers decided to drop the band from their label. Los Lobos spent the next few years on side projects. The band contributed along with Money Mark to the AIDS benefit album &quot;Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin&quot;, produced by the Red Hot Organization, on which they performed &quot;Pepe and Irene.&quot;

===1999–2006: Mammoth Records, subsequent releases===

Los Lobos signed to Mammoth Records (a music division of The Walt Disney Company) in 1997 and released &quot;This Time&quot; in 1999. Mammoth also reissued 1977&#x27;s &quot;Del Este de Los Angeles&quot;. In November 2000, Rhino/Warner Archives released the boxed set &quot;Cancionero: Mas y Mas&quot;.

In 2001, Los Lobos was awarded the El Premio &quot;Billboard&quot; Award.

The band released their Mammoth Records debut, &quot;Good Morning Aztlan&quot; in 2002. They released &quot;The Ride&quot; in 2004 as an unofficial 30th Anniversary album. &quot;The Ride&quot; featured Tom Waits, Mavis Staples, Bobby Womack, Elvis Costello and others covering Los Lobos music with the band. They did a follow-up album in 2005, &quot;Ride This – The Covers EP&quot; featuring Los Lobos covers of songs by Dave Alvin, Waits, Costello and others.

Los Lobos released its first full-length live-show DVD &quot;Live at the Fillmore&quot; in 2004. The DVD captures the band&#x27;s act over a two-day period in July at the famed San Francisco venue.

In September 2006, Los Lobos released &quot;The Town and the City&quot; (Mammoth Records) to much critical acclaim. The album&#x27;s lyrics deal with Louis Perez&#x27;s childhood in East Los Angeles, while the music provides complex and original soundscapes reminiscent of their previous release &quot;Kiko&quot;. Cartoonist Jaime Hernandez did the artwork for the album. The album is told in the first person, with each song serving as an episodic step.

===2007–present===
In 2007, Los Lobos performed a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Billy 1&quot; (from &quot;Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid&quot;) for the soundtrack to Todd Haynes&#x27;s film &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;. Also in 2007, they participated in &quot;Goin&#x27; Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino&quot; (Vanguard), contributing their version of Domino&#x27;s &quot;The Fat Man.&quot;

In 2009, the group under contract to Disney Music released an album of Disney covers, &quot;Los Lobos Goes Disney&quot; (Disney Sound/Walt Disney Records) and participated in a tribute album to the late Doug Sahm, &quot;Keep Your Soul: A Tribute to Doug Sahm&quot; (Vanguard). The same year, on October 13, they also played on the South Lawn of the White House during the &quot;In Performance at the White House: Fiesta Latina&quot; concert, celebrating Hispanic musical heritage.

In 2010, Cesar Rosas and David Hidalgo were featured artists in the Experience Hendrix Tour.

On August 3, 2010, the group released their first album in four years, &quot;Tin Can Trust&quot;. In 2011, the group was nominated for two Grammy Awards for &quot;Tin Can Trust&quot; in the categories of Best Rock Instrumental Performance and Best Americana Album.

In 2011, the group was awarded the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2013, the group toured Europe supporting Neil Young and Crazy Horse.

On September 25, 2015, their album &quot;Gates of Gold&quot; was released.

On October 9, 2015, Los Lobos was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the first time.

In 2017, Los Lobos appeared in the multi award-winning documentary film &quot;The American Epic Sessions&quot; directed by Bernard MacMahon, where they recorded &quot;El Cascabel&quot;, live direct-to-disc on the first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s. During their session, the belt holding the 100Ib weight that powered the 1924 cutting lathe broke and Jack White had to rush to an upholstery shop to repair it.

Los Lobos was inducted into the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame in 2018.

On October 4, 2019, Los Lobos released &quot;Llegó Navidad&quot;, an album of Christmas music from Central America and South America with Mexican folk songs, as well as an original song by Hidalgo and Pérez.

On January 1, 2020, Los Lobos performed on a Wells Fargo float in the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California.

The band was a recipient of a 2021 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government&#x27;s highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.

On July 30, 2021, Los Lobos released their 18th album, &quot;Native Sons&quot;, on New West Records. It is a collection of 12 songs written or performed by California-based musicians (including Jackson Browne, The Beach Boys, The Blasters, Thee Midniters, Willie Bobo, and Lalo Guerrero) with one song written by Hidalgo and Pérez, the title track &quot;Native Sons&quot;.

The group&#x27;s co-founder and former band member Francisco González died on March 30, 2022, at the age of 68.

On April 3, 2022, at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards which was held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Los Lobos won their fourth Grammy Award for &quot;Native Sons&quot;, this time in the Best Americana Album category.

On November 25, 2023, Los Lobos celebrated their 50th Anniversary at their alma mater, James Garfield High School in East Los Angeles with a sold-out performance at the high school&#x27;s auditorium. Two shows earlier that week in Los Angeles also sold out immediately: The Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood and The Paramount Theatre in Boyle Heights.

In February 2024, Los Lobos were inducted into the California Hall of Fame.

In April 2024, the 157-second trailer for a Los Lobos documentary titled &quot;Native Sons&quot; was released on YouTube. Among the people interviewed about Los Lobos are musicians Tom Waits, Linda Rondstadt, Ozomatli, Bonnie Raitt and actors Cheech Marin, Edward James Olmos and Chicano activist Dolores Huerta.

<text>Michael John Sweeney (born July 22, 1973) is an American former Major League Baseball designated hitter and first baseman. Sweeney played his first 13 seasons in the majors with the Kansas City Royals, first as a catcher, then at first base and designated hitter. Sweeney also played for the Oakland Athletics, Seattle Mariners, and Philadelphia Phillies. On March 25, 2011, Sweeney retired from baseball. He now works as a special assistant for the Kansas City Royals. Sweeney was inducted into the Kansas City Royals Hall of Fame on August 15, 2015.

==Major league career==

===Kansas City Royals===
==== 1991–1997: Minor leagues and MLB debut ====
Sweeney was drafted by the Royals as a catcher out of Ontario High School (Ontario, California) in the 10th round (262nd overall) of the 1991 MLB draft. He signed with the Royals in May 1991, a month before his graduation from Ontario High School. He had just led his Varsity baseball team as the team captain to a CIF victory with an undefeated record of 26-0 for the 1991 season.

Sweeney made his major league debut on September 14, 1995 at catcher. He got his first major league hit against Paul Assenmacher of the Cleveland Indians during the final game of the season. 

While Sweeney&#x27;s ability with the bat impressed the Royals, they were less than enamored with his defensive skills as a catcher, having him work with starter Mike Macfarlane on his defense.

Sweeney hit his first major league home run, off Seattle Mariners&#x27; pitcher Jamie Moyer, on August 12, 1996.

Sweeney caught 76 games in 1997, splitting time with Macfarlane. He hit a two-run, walk-off home run off Doug Brocail of the Detroit Tigers on May 15, 1997 in his only at bat of the game.

====1998: Primary catcher====
In 1998, Sweeney played in his first Opening Day game. He tied a club record with two hits in an inning versus the Oakland A&#x27;s on May 31. Sweeney missed hitting for the cycle by approximately 40 feet, when he retreated to second base on what appeared to be a sure triple in the eighth inning with the Kansas City Royals leading by a 12-6 score. He caught 91 games, the most of his major league career, serving as the regular starter after Macfarlane was traded midseason.

====1999–2001====
Sweeney&#x27;s big break came in 1999, after the Royals tried unsuccessfully to trade him during spring training. Riddled with injuries and with no other viable options, the Royals started using Sweeney as their regular designated hitter. After the sudden retirement of Jeff King, the Royals offered the first base job to rookie Jeremy Giambi. When Giambi showed reluctance, they gave the job to Sweeney, who responded by posting the highest fielding percentage by a regular first baseman in more than 20 years. His .322 batting average led the team and his 22 home runs and 102 RBI were second and third on the team, respectively. From July 18 to August 13, Sweeney had a hit in 25 consecutive games, collecting 42 hits total. The 25-game hitting streak is tied for fourth longest in Royals history with George Brett&#x27;s 25-game streak in 1983, trailing only Whit Merrifield&#x27;s 31-game streak spanning 2018–2019, Brett&#x27;s 30-game streak in 1980 and José Offerman&#x27;s 27-game streak in 1998.

In 2000, Sweeney was selected to his first of five All-Star games. He joined Jermaine Dye to become the first pair of Royals to go to the Mid-Summer Classic since 1989 (Bo Jackson and Mark Gubicza). Sweeney passed the 100 RBI mark for the second straight year on August 13, 2000, reaching the century mark faster than any player in Royals history. He finished second in the league with a club record 144 RBI, behind only Seattle&#x27;s Edgar Martínez&#x27;s 145 RBI, and breaking Hal McRae&#x27;s 1982 team mark of 133.

In June 2001, Sweeney hit .392 with 11 home runs and 29 RBI with a .794 slugging percentage and was named the American League Player of the Month for the only time in his career.

=====Sweeney vs. Weaver=====
Sweeney had his first career ejection against the Detroit Tigers on August 10 after charging pitcher Jeff Weaver in the sixth inning. Weaver was pitching to Sweeney. In between pitches, Sweeney asked the home plate umpire if Weaver could be asked to move the rosin bag from the top of the mound. After that, Weaver put his glove over his mouth and appeared to say something &quot;Webster never put in his dictionary&quot; to Sweeney. Sweeney was offended and launched his batting helmet at Weaver while charging the pitcher&#x27;s mound. He eventually tackled Weaver, igniting a bench-clearing brawl. Sweeney said afterwards that Weaver had been criticizing the Royals&#x27; younger players and Sweeney&#x27;s faith. Sweeney&#x27;s teammates did not deny his comments. Paul Byrd was one of the first to aid Sweeney as he held back the Tigers&#x27; catcher so that Sweeney could reach Weaver. Sweeney missed the next 15 games, five due to a &quot;bruised hand&quot; and the next ten to serve a suspension, his first career suspension. Prior to that, he had played in 171 consecutive games.

====2002–2004====
Sweeney had one of the best seasons of his career in 2002, hitting .340, the second-highest batting average in the American League and the second-highest in club history, behind George Brett&#x27;s .390 in 1980. He had a chance of winning the A.L. batting crown through the season&#x27;s final weekend but fell short of Manny Ramírez, who hit a league-best .349. Sweeney was hitting .347 on September 24 before going 2-for-16 in his final four games.

On August 14, 2002, he became the fifth Royal in club history to record a straight steal of home and the first since Fred Patek versus Minnesota on June 18, 1977, with a stolen base off the New York Yankees&#x27; Andy Pettitte. His stolen base came on a 1-2 count with left-hander Aaron Guiel at the plate and gave the Royals a 2–1 lead, but KC lost the game, 3–2, in 14 innings.

Sweeney was placed on the disabled list for the first time in his career on July 26, 2002 (retroactive to July 14) with a lower back and hip strain. He would continue to have injury problems throughout the rest of his career, including a lengthy DL stint during the 2003 season, with the Royals seeking their first winning season since the strike-shortened 1994 season, where they went 64–51.

During the 2003 season, Sweeney was named to his fourth consecutive Major League All-Star Game, joining Royals closer Mike MacDougal, marking the first time since 2000 (Sweeney and Jermaine Dye) that Kansas had two representatives and just the second time since 1989 (Bo Jackson and Mark Gubicza).

On July 22, 2004, Sweeney hit a grand slam and later hit an insurance three-run home run in a 13–7 Kansas City win. The seven RBI would be a career-high for Sweeney. He would go on to bat .287 with 22 home runs and 79 RBI during the 2004 season.

Through the 2004 season, Sweeney compiled a .305 average with 161 home runs and 683 RBI in 1,026 games.

====2005–2007====
In 2005, Sweeney was named the Royals&#x27; player of the year for the third time in his career. He led the team in average (.300) for the sixth time in his career, doubles (39) and home runs (21), despite playing in just 122 games. Sweeney was named the Players Choice Marvin Miller Man of the Year and was also named to the All-Star team for the fifth time in six seasons and the final time in his career.

Sweeney was restricted to designated hitter and was able to play just 60 games because of back problems in 2006. After returning from the disabled list on August 8, Sweeney hit .293 with six homers and 26 RBI, but missed another five games with a sore side.

On September 1, his first day back off the DL, Sweeney pinch-hit in the bottom of the ninth and hit a bloop base hit that broke up Minnesota Twins starting pitcher Scott Baker&#x27;s no-hitter. Baker had gone eight perfect innings before he walked Royals catcher John Buck at the beginning of the ninth. With two outs to go, Royals manager Buddy Bell pinch-hit Sweeney for Tony Peña Jr. and Sweeney ended the no-hitter.
Sweeney won the Hutch Award, which honors players who exemplify a fighting spirit, honoring Fred Hutchinson, who died of cancer in 1964.

===Oakland Athletics===
On February 10, 2008, Sweeney signed a minor league contract, with an invitation to spring training, with the Oakland Athletics.

After a strong spring in which he hit .308 with a home run, Sweeney&#x27;s contract was purchased on March 25, 2008. Sweeney underwent arthroscopic surgery on his troublesome left knee on June 11, and was expected to miss four to six weeks. After a brief return from the disabled list, Sweeney was released by the A&#x27;s on September 9.

After considering retirement, Sweeney said he would like to play one more year before retiring.

=== Seattle Mariners ===
On January 29, 2009, Sweeney signed a minor league deal with an invitation to spring training with the Seattle Mariners, citing his desire to play for Mariners&#x27; manager Don Wakamatsu who was Sweeney&#x27;s bench coach in Oakland. Sweeney made the major-league club Opening Day roster as a bench player. On April 22, 2009, Sweeney left the game during his first at-bat due to back spasms.

On May 3, 2009, Sweeney hit his first home run as a Mariner and 200th of his career in the 4th inning at Safeco Field against the Oakland Athletics. On August 6, in a return to Kansas City, Sweeney hit his 100th home run in Kauffman Stadium in an 8-2 loss to the Royals.

On November 5, 2009, Sweeney declared free agency.

On February 12, 2010, Sweeney re-signed with the Mariners to a minor league deal.

On March 30 the Mariners placed reserve first baseman/corner outfielder Ryan Garko on waivers, clearing room on the 25-man roster for Sweeney. Sweeney was not expected to make the team at the start of spring training but hit over .500 in exhibition games to beat out Garko. Sweeney would hit .263 with six home runs and 18 RBI during his time with the Mariners in 2010.

In May 2010, Sweeney was involved in an interesting situation. Teammate Ken Griffey Jr. was accused of napping during a pinch hitting opportunity, also known as &quot;Napgate&quot;. Sweeney said he challenged anyone who said Griffey was asleep &quot;to stand up and fight me&quot;; however, Griffey did not deny the accusation.

=== Philadelphia Phillies ===
On August 4, Sweeney was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies to replace injured first baseman Ryan Howard for a player to be named later and/or cash considerations.

Sweeney hit his first home run as a Phillie on August 29, 2010 in a 5-0 win over the San Diego Padres. With the Phillies, he also made the first postseason appearance of his career, going one for one at the plate in the NLDS.

On March 25, 2011 Sweeney signed a one-day contract with the Kansas City Royals and retired. He threw out the first pitch of the 2011 season for the Kansas City Royals on opening day.

On Tuesday, May 26, 2015, Mike Sweeney was inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame, along with former Marlins manager Jack McKeon, broadcaster Dave O&#x27;Brien, New York Mets p.r. executive Shannon Forde, and Bill Murray, the comedic actor and owner of several minor league baseball teams.

He appeared on the ballot for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum 2016 election and earned three votes.

==MLB Network==
In March 2012, Sweeney joined the MLB Network as a studio analyst. He would leave the network shortly after making his first few appearances on MLB Tonight.

==Last days as a Royal==
On September 29, 2007, the day before his final game, Sweeney took out a full page ad in the sports section of &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot;.

The following day, September 30, Sweeney took the field against the Cleveland Indians in front of 19,104 fans at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City. Sweeney&#x27;s first at bat was interrupted by a standing ovation. His second at bat was delayed as well due to applause. Sweeney was removed from first base in the 7th inning and was given a third standing ovation. Sweeney entered the dugout, and upon still hearing fans roaring, he exited the dugout towards the field and bowed, waved, and said &quot;Thank you.&quot; After the game, Sweeney and his two children rounded the bases as part of a Sunday home game tradition at Kauffman Stadium called &quot;Sunday Fan Fun Run.&quot; Then he spent time talking to reporters, and as always, signed autographs for fans before he left the parking lot. Since leaving the Kansas City Royals his Number 29 has been left out of circulation leading some to believe the Royals might end up retiring his number one day. After leaving the Royals, Sweeney ended up wearing #5 for the rest of his career with the Oakland Athletics, Seattle Mariners, and Philadelphia Phillies.

==Return to Royals==
In February 2014, the Kansas City Royals announced that they had hired Sweeney as a special assistant to baseball operations. Sweeney&#x27;s response to receiving the new job: &quot;The only thing I was unable to accomplish during my playing days was to bring October baseball back to Kansas City. With this new position, my goal is do as much as I can to help the Royals get back to being one of the prized organizations in baseball, as it was in the 1980s.&quot; Sweeney settled into the role quite quickly, attending the Royals&#x27; spring training in Surprise, Arizona as a guest instructor that same month. That year, the Royals made the postseason for the first time in 29 years.

==Personal life==
On November 9, 2002, Sweeney married Shara Nettles, the daughter of former major leaguer Jim Nettles, niece of Graig Nettles. They have six children together; three sons and three daughters.

Due to fires in San Diego and the surrounding areas, Sweeney&#x27;s family was forced to evacuate their home in Rancho Santa Fe and stay with his parents, who live in Ontario, California. He stated in a report on MLB.com that the few possessions that they took for safekeeping were their marriage certificate, three wedding photographs, birth certificates, and two pictures of his children with Pope Benedict, taken while they were in Rome the previous year. It was later reported that their house was still standing, although damaged by smoke and water.

===Community involvement===
A fluent speaker of Spanish, Sweeney was very active in the K.C. community while a member of the Royals. He has been a nominee for the Roberto Clemente Award, and has continued to support the community through various programs, including the Kansas City FCA chapter, Children&#x27;s Mercy Hospital and the Boys and Girls Club of Kansas City.

Sweeney has also purchased a dirt field in a poorer section of downtown Kansas City. The baseball field, once used to sell drugs, is now called Sweeney Family Field.

He was named the 2003 and 2004 Good Guy in Sports by the &quot;Sporting News&quot;. He teams up annually with former Kansas City Chiefs fullback Tony Richardson to host the Sweeney-Richardson Golf Classic, which benefits a faith-based outreach program and
invites area charity and non-profit groups to attend Royals games as part of the &quot;Sween Team&quot;.

Sweeney is known all around Kansas City for being very polite and friendly towards all fans. He always signs autographs for all the fans who ask for one before and after games whether on the field or in the parking lot.

Before the 2009 season, the Royals organization created the Mike Sweeney Award which recognizes a player best representing the organization on and off the field.

Sweeney was presented with the Mr. Baseball Award—the top honor at the Royals Awards dinner in January 2009. The award is named for Ewing Kauffman, founder of the Royals and the team for which Sweeney played 13 years and served as captain.

===Religion and activism===
Sweeney is a devout Catholic and has appeared on EWTN&#x27;s &quot;Life on the Rock&quot;, a program targeted towards young Christians. On October 24, 2006, he was featured in a political advertisement opposing an embryonic stem cell research bill in Missouri. It was in response to a pro-embryonic research advertisement featuring actor Michael J. Fox. Sweeney appeared with Jim Caviezel, Patricia Heaton, Jeff Suppan, and Kurt Warner.

Sweeney is also the advisory chairman of the Catholic Athletes for Christ and spokesman for Life Teen, the largest Catholic youth ministry program in the United States.

On June 13, 2007, Mike and his wife Shara hosted the Lunch for Life and raised $60,000 for the crisis pregnancy centers throughout Kansas City. They also honored a 19-year-old mother who was going to have an abortion but instead chose to have her baby. The Sweeneys gave the girl the first Life Award, which included gift certificates to salons and massage parlors and a grocery store, a baby stroller, a baby crib and clothes for the baby. She also received a $5,000 check to purchase a new automobile.

In 2010, Sweeney spoke to the &quot;National Catholic Register&quot; about his Catholic faith.

Sweeney had &quot;Lose My Soul&quot; by Toby Mac played over the stadium sound system at Citizens Bank Park when he came up to bat. Mac used to be with the group DC Talk.

<text>David Kent Hidalgo (born October 6, 1954, in Los Angeles) is an American singer-songwriter, best known for his work with the band Los Lobos. Hidalgo frequently plays musical instruments such as accordion, violin, 6-string banjo, cello, requinto jarocho, percussion, drums and guitar as a session musician on other artists&#x27; releases.

==Early life and education==
==Career==
In 1973, Hidalgo was one of the founding members of Los Lobos, for which he wrote most songs together with Louie Pérez. He also participated as a guest musician on albums of other artists, among them David Alvin, Buckwheat Zydeco, Paul Burlison, T-Bone Burnett, Peter Case, Toni Childs, Marc Cohn, Ry Cooder, Elvis Costello, Crowded House, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, John Lee Hooker, Rickie Lee Jones, Leo Kottke, Roy Orbison, Dolly Parton, Pierce Pettis, Bonnie Raitt, Paul Simon, Taj Mahal, Suzanne Vega, Bob Dylan and Tom Waits. He is a member of the supergroup Los Super Seven and of the Latin Playboys, a side project made up of some of the members of Los Lobos. With Mike Halby of Canned Heat, he formed another band, Houndog, as a side project. He also appeared on national television in the U.S., backing Waits.

In 1987, he contributed the song &quot;Will the Wolf Survive?&quot; to the movie &quot;Promised Land&quot;. For Dennis Hopper&#x27;s &quot;Colors&quot; (1988), he wrote the song &quot;One Time, One Night&quot;. He wrote the songs &quot;Manifold De Amour&quot;, &quot;Forever Night Shade Mary&quot; and &quot;Chinese Surprize&quot; for the 1995 action film &quot;Desperado.&quot; He contributed his melancholic song &quot;La pistola y el corazón&quot; for the movie &quot;The Mexican&quot; (2001).

Hidalgo&#x27;s songs have been covered by the Jerry Garcia Band, Waylon Jennings, Bonnie Raitt and others. He has performed in Eric Clapton&#x27;s Crossroads Guitar Festival since its inception in 2004, including a performance with Los Lobos in April 2013 at Madison Square Garden. Clapton joined the band on stage for their song &quot;Burn It Down&quot;, from their 2010 album, &quot;Tin Can Trust&quot;.

TAU&#x27;s origins date back to 1956, when three research institutes: the Tel Aviv School of Law and Economics (established in 1935), the Institute of Natural Sciences (established in 1931), and the Academic Institute of Jewish Studies (established in 1954) – joined to form Tel Aviv University. Initially operated by the Tel Aviv municipality, the university was granted autonomy in 1963, and George S. Wise was its first president, from that year until 1971. The Ramat Aviv campus, covering an area of , on top of the depopulated and razed Palestinian village of Sheikh Munis, was established that same year. Its succeeding presidents have been Yuval Ne&#x27;eman from 1971 to 1977, Haim Ben-Shahar from 1977 to 1983, Moshe Many from 1983 to 1991, Yoram Dinstein from 1991 to 1999, Itamar Rabinovich from 1999 to 2006, Zvi Galil from 2006 to 2009, Joseph Klafter from 2009 to 2019, and Ariel Porat since 2019.

Sackler Family

Tel Aviv University held significant ties to the Sackler family. As more became known of the role of members of the Sackler family in the global opioid crisis, many including the Israel Medical Association called for the removal of the Sackler name from the Faculty of Medicine. As of November 2021, no members of the Sackler family served on the university&#x27;s board of governors. In June 2023, the Sackler name was removed from the university&#x27;s Faculty of Medicine. In November 2024, the university stripped the Sackler name from its international prize in biophysics.

<text>Lyman Wesley Bostock Jr. (November 22, 1950 – September 24, 1978) was an American professional baseball player. He played Major League Baseball for four seasons, as an outfielder for the Minnesota Twins and California Angels (1978), with a lifetime average of .311. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed.

Bostock was shot and mortally wounded while riding as a passenger in a vehicle in his hometown of Gary, Indiana, on September 23, 1978, hours after playing against the Chicago White Sox earlier in the day. He died at 1:30 a.m. the next day.

His shooter was sentenced to a psychiatric hospital and released after seven months. After the shooter&#x27;s release, Indiana legislators introduced the guilty but mentally ill plea so that mentally ill people would serve prison time after being released from inpatient mental health treatment.

==Early life==
Born in Birmingham, Alabama, Bostock was the son of Annie Pearl Bostock and Lyman Bostock Sr. (1918–2005), a Negro leagues professional baseball star from 1938 to 1954 as a first baseman. Pearl and Bostock Sr. split when Bostock Jr. was a young child, with Pearl relocating with her son first to Gary, Indiana, in 1954. In 1958, the two again relocated, this time to Los Angeles. The younger Bostock remained estranged from his father for the remainder of his life, feeling that his father had abandoned him.

At one point during his youth, Bostock&#x27;s baseball glove was stolen. With his mother unable to afford to purchase another, he had to use a glove given to him by a friend of the family. However, the donated glove was for left-handed fielders. Bostock&#x27;s discomfort in catching fly balls with the hand he was unaccustomed to using led him to begin making basket catches at that time. The habit stayed with him and he frequently made basket catches of fly balls for the remainder of 
&quot;When I was 8 years old, my mother bought me my first glove,&quot; Bostock had recalled. &quot;But someone stole it the next day. My mother wasn&#x27;t about to buy me another one. But a friend of hers at work gave her a replacement. Unfortunately, it was a left-hander&#x27;s model and I&#x27;m right-handed. Since it was the only glove I had, I had to use it. It was the only way I could catch the ball. It became a habit, and I still have it.&quot;

Bostock played baseball at Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles, then attended San Fernando Valley State College (now California State University, Northridge (CSUN)). It was there that he met Yuovene Brooks, who would become his wife. Bostock did not play baseball during his first two years of college, choosing instead to become involved in student activism. Nonetheless, he was selected in the 1970 amateur draft by the St. Louis Cardinals.

&quot;What you saw is what you got from Lyman,&quot; said Bob Hiegert, Bostock&#x27;s college coach at Cal State Northridge. &quot;There was nothing hidden about Lyman. He wore his heart on his sleeve.&quot;

Bostock chose not to sign, stayed in college, and began playing baseball for Coach Hiegert and the Matadors. He was an all-conference player in the California Collegiate Athletic Association in both of his seasons at San Fernando Valley, hitting .344 as a junior and .296 as a senior, leading the Matadors to a second-place finish at the Division II College World Series in 1972. He was selected by the Twins in the 26th round (596th overall) of the 1972 amateur draft and decided to turn professional, just 15 credits short of finishing his bachelor&#x27;s degree.

==Baseball career ==

===Minor leagues (1972-1974)===
Bostock&#x27;s minor league stops were with the Class A Charlotte Twins in 1972; the Class AA Orlando Twins in 1973, and the Class AAA Tacoma Twins in 1974. His batting averages for those years were .294, .313, and .333, respectively. In 1975, he was hitting .391 after 22 games and 92 at bats with Tacoma when the Minnesota Twins called him up.

===Minnesota Twins (1975-1977)===
Bostock was promoted to the major leagues in April 1975, making his major league debut on April 8, when he was 1-for-4 with two walks and three runs scored in an 11–4 Twins win over the For the season, he batted .282 in 98 games for Minnesota (and .391 in 22 games for the Tacoma Twins in the Pacific Coast League).

A fine defensive center fielder, Bostock finished fourth in the tight American League batting race in 1976, his first full season in the majors. He hit .323, finishing behind the Kansas City Royals&#x27; George Brett (.333) and Hal McRae (.332), and teammate Rod Carew (.331). Bostock hit for the cycle on July 24, in a 17–2 Twins victory over the Chicago White Sox.

In 1977, Bostock&#x27;s .336 batting average was second only to the .388 of Carew. On May 25, Bostock collected 12 putouts in the second game of a doubleheader against the Boston Red Sox, tying the major league mark for putouts by an outfielder, which had been set by Earl Clark of the Boston Braves and was equalled by Jacoby Ellsbury Bostock had a total of 17 putouts in the doubleheader, which set an American League record 

===California Angels (1978)===

===Attempt to return salary===
After the 1977 season ended, Bostock became one of baseball&#x27;s earliest big-money free agents, and signed with the California Angels, owned by Bostock had made $20,000 with the Twins in 1977 and signed a $2.3 million, six-year contract with the Angels. The Twins, Padres and Yankees had all tried to sign Bostock. Almost immediately, Bostock donated $10,000 to a church in his native Birmingham, Alabama to rebuild its Sunday school.

The 1978 season started off poorly for Bostock; he batted .150 for the month of April. Bostock met with the team&#x27;s management and attempted to return his April salary, saying he had not earned it. The team refused, so Bostock announced he would donate his April salary to charity.

&quot;He came into my office and told me he was reluctant to take his salary,&quot; Angels&#x27; general manager Buzzy Bavasi recalled. &quot;He said, &#x27;I&#x27;m not doing my job.&#x27; But I told him, &#x27;I won&#x27;t let you do that.&#x27; And he says, &#x27;Why not?&#x27; So I told him, &#x27;What if you hit .600 next month? You&#x27;re sure as hell not getting any more money out of me.&#x27; &quot;

Thousands of requests came in for the money, and Bostock reviewed each one of them, trying to determine who needed it the most. After his poor April, Bostock hit .404 in June and was hitting .296 when he was killed in September.

As the 1978 season neared its conclusion, Bostock was leading the Angels in batting. With a week remaining in the season, he went 2-for-4 with a walk in his final game, a Saturday afternoon game against the White Sox in Chicago, to raise his season average to .296.

In his four-season career, Bostock was a .311 career hitter, with a .365 on-base percentage, 23 home runs, 102 doubles, 30 triples, 45 stolen bases and 250 runs batted in during 526 games. A contact hitter, he had 171 career walks against 174 career strikeouts and a .988 fielding percentage playing all three outfield positions, with the majority in centerfield.

== Shooting death ==
Following the game at Comiskey Park, as he regularly did when in Chicago, Bostock visited his uncle Thomas Turner in nearby After eating a meal with a group of relatives at Turner&#x27;s home, Bostock and his uncle went to visit Joan Hawkins, a woman whom Bostock had tutored as a teenager, but had not seen for several years. After the visit, Turner agreed to give Hawkins and her sister, Barbara Smith, a ride to their cousin&#x27;s house. Turner drove his vehicle, with Hawkins seated in the front passenger&#x27;s seat. Bostock and Barbara Smith rode in the vehicle&#x27;s back seat.

Barbara Smith had been living with Hawkins while estranged from her husband, Leonard Smith. Unbeknownst to the group, Leonard Smith was outside Hawkins&#x27; home in his car, and observed the group&#x27;s departure in Turner&#x27;s car. According to Leonard Smith, his wife was frequently unfaithful to him, and though he did not know Bostock, he later said that upon seeing Bostock get into the back seat of Turner&#x27;s vehicle with his wife, he concluded that the two were having an affair.

At 10:40 p.m. as Turner&#x27;s vehicle was stopped at a traffic signal at the intersection of 5th and Jackson Streets, Leonard Smith&#x27;s car pulled up alongside them. Leonard Smith leaned out of his vehicle and fired one round from a .410 caliber shotgun into the back seat of Turner&#x27;s car, where Bostock and Barbara Smith were seated. Leonard Smith said that his estranged wife was his only intended target; however, Bostock was seated between Barbara Smith and the position from which Leonard Smith was firing. Instead of striking her, the shot struck Bostock squarely in the right temple. At age 27, he died two hours later at a Barbara Smith was hospitalized in fair condition with pellet wounds to her face.

=== Aftermath and trial===
Smith was tried twice for murder, with his lawyers arguing that Barbara Smith&#x27;s alleged infidelity had driven him insane. The first trial resulted in a hung jury. In the second trial, Smith was found not guilty by reason of insanity, and committed for treatment to Logansport State Hospital. Within seven months, he was deemed no longer mentally ill by his psychiatrists and released. Including his time in jail awaiting and during trial, Smith&#x27;s time in custody amounted to 21 months. In the aftermath of Smith&#x27;s case, the legislature in Indiana changed the state&#x27;s insanity laws. After the change, a person found to be insane at the time of the commission of a crime could still be found legally guilty, and thus could be sent to prison if and when he or she was released from psychiatric treatment.

Leonard Smith returned to Gary, Indiana, where he resided for the remainder of his life, moving in his later years in a high-rise apartment building for senior citizens. After his 1980 release from custody, he never again ran afoul of the law and he declined all requests to comment publicly about the killing of Bostock. In 2010, Smith died of natural causes at the age of 64.

Bostock is interred in the Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California. &quot;There were never enough hours in the day for Lyman,&quot; said Angels teammate Bobby Grich. &quot;We called him &#x27;Jibber-Jabber&#x27; because he was always talking. Everyone was crazy about him because he was so outgoing and friendly, always up, always looking on the bright side.&quot;

Said Twins teammate Rod Carew: “Lyman Bostock was my teammate on the Twins for three years. I knew he was very close to an uncle who lived in Gary, Indiana. Lyman often visited him after games against the White Sox. How senseless. How horrible. I still can’t believe it happened. Everyone really liked Lyman. When we played the Angels [in 1978], he sent the batboy over to me with a newspaper (&quot;The Sporting News&quot;) photograph of himself wearing sunglasses with dollar signs on the lenses. Above the picture Lyman had written, Rod, I need help. His average was around .200. So I watched him in the game. I noticed he was lunging at pitches. He was too anxious. His swing wasn’t smooth, as it normally is. I told him I thought he was trying to hit the ball into “holes” between fielders instead of swinging with the pitch. No one can manipulate a bat so well that he can consistently hit the ball into holes. I don&#x27;t know if I helped or not, but Lyman picked up and was batting .296 when he died.

In his eulogy at the funeral of Bostock, Angels teammate Ken Brett said, &quot;We called him Jibber Jabber because he enlivened every clubhouse scene, chasing tension, drawing laughter in the darkest hour of defeat. When winning wasn’t in the plan, Lyman knew the sun would come up the next morning…. There’s only one consolation: We’re all better persons for having him touch our lives.&quot;

<text>A lieutenant ( , ; abbreviated Lt., Lt, LT, Lieut and similar) is a junior commissioned officer rank in the armed forces of many nations, as well as fire services, emergency medical services, security services and police forces.

The rank in armies and air forces is often subdivided into subcategories of seniority. In English-speaking navies, lieutenants are often equivalent to the army rank of captain; in other navies, the lieutenants are usually equal to their army counterparts.

&quot;Lieutenant&quot; may also appear as part of a title used in various other organisations with a codified command structure. It often designates someone who is &quot;second-in-command&quot;, and as such, may precede the name of the rank directly above it. For example, a &quot;lieutenant master&quot; is likely to be second-in-command to the &quot;master&quot; in an organisation using both ranks.

Political uses include lieutenant governor in various governments, such as the viceregal representatives of the Crown in Canadian provinces. In the United Kingdom, a lord lieutenant is the sovereign&#x27;s representative in a county or lieutenancy area, while a deputy lieutenant is one of the lord lieutenant&#x27;s deputies.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;lieutenant&quot; derives from French; the meaning &quot;place&quot; as in a position (cf. ); and meaning &quot;holding&quot; as in &quot;holding a position&quot;; thus a &quot;lieutenant&quot; is a placeholder for a superior, during their absence (compare the Latin ).

In the 19th century, British writers who considered this word either an imposition on the English language, or difficult for common soldiers and sailors, argued for it to be replaced by the calque &quot;steadholder&quot;. However, their efforts failed, and the French word is still used, along with its many variations (e.g. lieutenant colonel, lieutenant general, lieutenant commander, flight lieutenant, second lieutenant and many non-English language examples), in both the Old and the New World.

===Pronunciation===
Pronunciation of &quot;lieutenant&quot; as is generally associated with the armies of British Commonwealth countries, while is generally associated with the United States military. The early history of the pronunciation is unclear; Middle English spellings suggest that both pronunciations may have existed even then. The majority of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century sources show pronunciations with or , but Bullokar has .

The rare Old French variant spelling for Modern French () supports the suggestion that a final of the Old French word was in certain environments perceived as an . Furthermore, in Latin, the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the era, the letter is used for both and .
In Royal Naval (RN) tradition—and other English-speaking navies outside the United States—a reduced pronunciation is used. This is not recognised as current by recent editions of the &quot;OED&quot; (although the RN pronunciation was included in editions of the &quot;OED&quot; up until the 1970s).

==Military rank==
===Lieutenant===
The senior grade of lieutenant is known as first lieutenant in the United States, and as lieutenant in the United Kingdom and the rest of the English-speaking world. In countries that do not speak English, the rank title usually translates as &quot;lieutenant&quot;, but may also translate as &quot;first lieutenant&quot; or &quot;senior lieutenant&quot;. The Israel Defense Forces rank &quot;segen&quot; (סגן) literally translates as &quot;deputy&quot;, which is equivalent to a lieutenant. In the Finnish military there is a senior lieutenant grade that ranks above lieutenant and second lieutenant but below captain; it does not have an English equivalent. In Germany it is called (senior lieutenant).

====Army rank====
Conventionally, armies and other services or branches that use army-style rank titles have two grades of lieutenant, but a few also use a third, more junior, rank. Historically, the &quot;lieutenant&quot; was the deputy to a &quot;captain&quot;, and as the rank structure of armies began to formalise, this came to mean that a captain commanded a company and had several lieutenants, each commanding a platoon. Where more junior officers were employed as deputies to the lieutenant, they went by many names, including second lieutenant, sub-lieutenant, ensign and cornet. Some parts of the British Army, including the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers and fusilier regiments, used first lieutenant as well as second lieutenant until the end of the 19th century, and some British Army regiments still preserve cornet as an official alternative to second lieutenant.

There is great variation in the insignia used worldwide. In most English-speaking and Arabic-speaking countries, as well as a number of European and South American nations, full lieutenants (and equivalents) usually wear two stars (pips) and second lieutenants (and equivalents) one. An example of an exception is the United States, whose armed forces distinguish their lieutenant ranks with a silver bar for first lieutenant and a gold bar for second lieutenant.
====Marine rank====
The United States Marine Corps and British Royal Marines both use army ranks, while many former Eastern-Bloc marine forces retain the naval rank structure. Before 1999 the Royal Marines enjoyed the same rank structure as the army, but at a grade higher; thus a Royal Marine captain ranked with and was paid the same as a British Army major. This historical remnant caused increasing confusion in multi-national operations and was abolished.

====Air force rank====
While some air forces use the army rank system, the British Royal Air Force and many other Commonwealth air forces use another rank system in which flight lieutenant ranks with an army captain and naval lieutenant, a flying officer ranks with an army lieutenant and a pilot officer with an army second lieutenant.

In the US Air Force, the Third Lieutenant Program refers specifically to a training program at active duty air force bases for cadets of the Air Force Academy and Air Force ROTC the summer before their fourth and final year before graduation and commissioning. A single silver or subdued pip is used to designate this rank.

The Royal Air Force also has an acting pilot officer designation, the most junior commissioned rank in the British armed forces. It is functionally equivalent to third lieutenant.

====Naval rank====

During the early days of the naval rank, a lieutenant might be very junior indeed, or might be on the cusp of promotion to captain; by modern standards, he might rank with any army rank between second lieutenant and lieutenant colonel. As the rank structure of navies stabilized, and the ranks of commander, lieutenant commander and sub-lieutenant were introduced, the naval lieutenant came to rank with an army captain (NATO OF-2 or US O-3).

The insignia of a lieutenant in many navies, including the Royal Navy, consists of two medium gold braid stripes (top stripe with loop) on a navy blue or black background. Where in Myanmar Navy, they&#x27;re Sub Lieutenant with the insignia of 2 gold stars. This pattern was copied by the United States Navy and various Air Forces for their equivalent ranks grades, except that the loop is removed (see flight lieutenant).

===Lieutenant commander===

Lieutenants were commonly put in command of smaller vessels not warranting a commander or captain: such a lieutenant was called a &quot;lieutenant commanding&quot; or &quot;lieutenant commandant&quot; in the United States Navy, and a &quot;lieutenant in command&quot; or &quot;lieutenant and commander&quot; in the Royal Navy. The USN settled on &quot;lieutenant commander&quot; in 1862, and made it a distinct rank; the Royal Navy followed suit in March 1914. The insignia of an additional half-thickness stripe between the two full stripes of a lieutenant was introduced in 1877 for a Royal Navy lieutenant of 8 years seniority, and used for lieutenant commanders upon introduction of their rank.

===Senior lieutenant===
===First lieutenant===
====&quot;First lieutenant&quot; in naval use====
The first lieutenant in the Royal Navy and other Commonwealth navies, is a post or appointment, rather than a rank. Historically the lieutenants in a ship were ranked in accordance with seniority, with the most senior being termed the &quot;first lieutenant&quot; and acting as the second-in-command. Although lieutenants are no longer numbered by seniority, the post of &quot;first lieutenant&quot; remains. In minor war vessels, destroyers and frigates the first lieutenant (either a lieutenant or lieutenant-commander) is second in command, executive officer (XO) and head of the executive branch; in larger ships where a commander of the warfare specialization is appointed as the executive officer, a first lieutenant (normally a lieutenant-commander) is appointed as his deputy. The post of first lieutenant in a shore establishment carries a similar responsibility to the first lieutenant of a capital ship.

In the U.S. Navy or U.S. Coast Guard the billet of first lieutenant describes the officer in charge of the deck department or division, depending upon the size of the ship. In smaller ships with only a single deck division, the billet is typically filled by an ensign while in larger ships with a deck department, consisting of multiple subordinate divisions, the billet may be filled by a lieutenant commander. On submarines and smaller Coast Guard cutters the billet of first lieutenant may be filled by a petty officer.

===Second lieutenant===

Second lieutenant is usually the most junior grade of commissioned officer. In most cases, newly commissioned officers do not remain at the rank for long before being promoted, and both university graduates and officers commissioned from the ranks may skip the rank altogether.

===Third lieutenant===
====United States rank====
In March 1813, the US Army created the rank of third lieutenant. The rank was used as the entry level officer rank for the Ordnance Department and the Corps of Artillery until March 1821. Throughout the 19th century and until as late as World War II the United States Army sometimes referred to brevet second lieutenants as &quot;third lieutenants&quot;. These were typically newly commissioned officers for which no authorized second lieutenant position existed. Additionally, the Confederate States Army also used &quot;third lieutenant&quot;, typically as the lowest ranking commissioned officer in an infantry company.

Notably, the United States Revenue Cutter Service used a simple officer rank structure with Captain, First, Second and Third Lieutenants, each of whom had distinct insignia. The title of Third Lieutenant, essentially equal to the rank of ensign, existed until 1915 when the Service became the nucleus of the new United States Coast Guard. Because of the time required to fully establish this organization the rank continued for some time afterwards; the first Coast Guard aviator, Elmer F. Stone, was a third lieutenant until 1918.

===Sub-lieutenant===

In the Royal Navy, the commissioned rank of mate was created in 1840, and was renamed sub-lieutenant in 1860. In the US Navy, the rank was called master until 1883, when it was renamed lieutenant, junior grade. In many navies, a sub-lieutenant is a naval commissioned or subordinate officer, ranking below a lieutenant, but in Brazil it is the highest non-commissioned rank, and in Spain it is the second highest non-commissioned rank. In Portugal, sub-lieutenant is the rank of a junior naval officer graduated from a civil university or promoted from a NCO rank, while the equivalent rank of an officer graduated in the naval academy is designated midshipman.

==Other uses==
===Police rank===
====France and the French Union====
The first French Lieutenant of Police, Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie, was appointed in Paris by Louis XIV on 15 March 1667 to command a reformed police force. He was later elevated to Lieutenant-General of Police. In the 17th century, the term &quot;lieutenant&quot; corresponded to &quot;deputy&quot; (i.e. a person appointed to carry out a task). La Reynie was the deputy for policing duties of the Provost of Paris, the ceremonial representative of the King in Paris. In 1995, the rank of &quot;lieutenant&quot; was introduced in the National Police as the first rank of the police officers scale.

====United Kingdom and Commonwealth police forces====
The rank of Lieutenant was formerly used in areas outside of the Metropolitan Police. The adoption of standardized ranks across the United Kingdom has eliminated its use. A number of city and burgh police forces in Scotland used the rank of lieutenant (and detective lieutenant) between inspector and superintendent from 1812 to 1948. It was replaced by the rank of chief inspector. The Royal Newfoundland Constabulary (founded 1871) had the rank of lieutenant between staff sergeant and inspector until 1997. In Australia, Queensland&#x27;s first police force (founded 1864) had second lieutenants and lieutenants between the ranks of sergeant and inspector-general.

====United States police forces====
The rank of police lieutenant is used in most medium or large police departments in the United States, where it is one rank above sergeant and two ranks above a regular police officer (three in departments with a corporal rank). It is roughly equivalent to an inspector in the British and Canadian police forces. The usual role of a lieutenant is to carry out administrative duties and assist precinct commanders (normally a captain, or sometimes the local police chiefs). In smaller police departments, they may command a precinct itself. Lieutenants either command a watch (8-hour &quot;shift&quot;) of regular officers or a special unit for operations or investigations (like a Robbery-Homicide squad). The typical rank insignia for a lieutenant is a single silver bar (like that of an Army or Marine Corps First Lieutenant) or a single gold bar (like that of an Army or Marine Corps Second Lieutenant). Some police departments split the rank of lieutenant into two separate grades.

====Other nations====
===Fire services rank===
==== Singapore ====
In the Singapore Civil Defence Force, the rank of lieutenant (LTA) is the second-lowest commissioned rank. The rank insignia of LTA is two pips.

=== Political titles ===
====Canada====
In Canada, the representative of the Canadian monarch in each province is called the Lieutenant Governor. The Lieutenant Governor exercises all the royal prerogative powers that the monarch holds.

====France====
In French history, &quot;lieutenant du roi&quot; was a title borne by the officer sent with military powers to represent the king in certain provinces. It is in the sense of a deputy that it has entered into the titles of more senior officers, lieutenant general and lieutenant colonel.

====United Kingdom====
The British monarch&#x27;s representatives in the counties of the United Kingdom are called Lords Lieutenant. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland performed the function of viceroy in Ireland.

====United States====
The Lieutenant Governor is an official in state governments of 45 out of 50 United States. In most cases, the lieutenant governor is the highest officer of state after the governor, standing in for the governor when they are absent from the state or temporarily incapacitated. In the event a governor dies, resigns, or is removed from office, the lieutenant governor typically becomes governor.

In the United States, a governor serves as the chief executive officer and commander-in-chief in each of the fifty states and in the five permanently inhabited territories, functioning as both head of state and head of government therein.

===Other organisations===

==== The Boys&#x27; Brigade ====
Leaders, or officers of the Boys&#x27; Brigade, particularly in the United Kingdom, are ranked as lieutenants after having completed their formal training, before which they are ranked as warrant officers. Officers serving in staff or command posts are awarded the &quot;brevet&quot; rank of captain, these officers then revert to their lieutenancy after having completed their tour of duty.

==== National Civil Defence Cadet Corps ====
The rank of cadet lieutenant (CLT) is given to officer cadet trainees who have passed their officer&#x27;s course. The rank insignia of CLT is a pip and a bar below it. CLTs may be promoted to the rank of senior cadet lieutenant (S/CLT), which has a rank insignia of a pip and two bars below it.

==== The Salvation Army ====
The Salvation Army also uses lieutenant to denote first time officers, or clergymen/women.

<text>Pierce Pettis (born April 14, 1954) is an American singer-songwriter from Fort Payne, Alabama.

== Biography ==
A former staff writer for PolyGram Publishing in Nashville, Pettis&#x27; musical career was started in 1979 when Joan Baez covered one of his songs, &quot;Song at the End of the Movie&quot;, on her album &quot;Honest Lullaby&quot;. Following that release, Pettis became heavily involved in the &quot;Fast Folk movement&quot; in New York in the 1980s alongside artists such as Shawn Colvin and Suzanne Vega.

In 1984, Pettis released his first independent solo album, &quot;Moments&quot;. Signing with High Street Records in 1989, he made three albums with them: &quot;While the Serpent Lies Sleeping&quot; in 1989; &quot;Tinseltown&quot;, produced by Mark Heard in 1991; and &quot;Chase the Buffalo&quot;, produced by David Miner in 1993. None of these releases made Pettis a household name, but his music became extremely popular with other artists. The production on &quot;While the Serpent Lies Sleeping&quot; is erratic, apparently trying to balance a folk-rock sound with Pierce&#x27;s mostly introspective and introverted lyrics. Pettis and producer Doug Jansen Smith argued often over the production, and did not work with each other subsequently. Mark Heard, Pettis&#x27; own choice as producer for &quot;Tinseltown&quot; gave that album a more straightforward folk sound, with the occasional touch of bluegrass or rock. The lyrics are also more provocative, and the album includes a few tracks that are basically protest songs. Heard and Pettis became close friends, and after Heard&#x27;s untimely death in 1992, Pettis made a decision to include a Mark Heard song on every subsequent album of his own until Heard&#x27;s songwriting abilities gained greater attention, a practice Pettis continues to this day. &quot;Chase the Buffalo&quot;, undoubtedly the most lyrically rich album of the High Street years, established Pettis firmly as a &quot;songwriter&#x27;s songwriter&quot; and further developed the solid folk atmosphere of the previous album, adding more prominent bass and percussion instruments and starting to move away from keyboard sounds. Lyrically the album struck a fine balance between songs looking inward and looking outward.

When Pettis&#x27; contract with High Street ended, he signed with Compass Records, where he has remained since. 1996 saw his first release with them, &quot;Making Light of It&quot;, a low-key collection of songs, the majority returning to an introspective demeanor and tone, produced by David Miner (T-Bone Burnett, Elvis Costello), and featuring Derri Daugherty and Steve Hindalong of The Choir. Musically, &quot;roots folk&quot; would not be a bad description, though the tone is not old-timey in any way. &quot;Everything Matters&quot; followed in 1998, with an increased tempo overall and a few regionally oriented songs that explored and celebrated Southern cities and personalities. The music of this record was a delicate and successful blend of a more sparse &quot;roots folk&quot; sound backed by solid bass and percussion and produced by Grammy award-winning artist Gordon Kennedy (best known for co-writing Eric Clapton&#x27;s &quot;Change the World&quot;). 2001 saw Pettis&#x27; most regionally oriented album, &quot;State of Grace&quot; released, with a fuller, more straightforwardly folk tone and atmosphere. 2004&#x27;s &quot;Great Big World&quot; record saw Pettis collaborating with a number of other songwriters for the majority of the tracks, with a still-present regional tendency, and similar sound musically to the previous album. The album&#x27;s cover art was painted by the southern folk artist Terry Cannon. &quot;Great Big World&quot; featured musicians like Kenny Malone on percussion and bassist Danny Thompson of Pentangle fame. In 2009 &quot;That Kind of Love&quot; included less of a regional focus with a collection of mostly mid-tempo, personal and contemplative songs, although the three cover tracks on the album, from Mark Heard, Jesse Winchester, and Woody Guthrie, are uptempo blues or bluegrass. 2013 saw Pettis, along with Tom Kimmel and Kate Campbell, form the New Agrarians and release a debut album on the independent Due South label. Pettis tours frequently, alternating between solo shows, concerts with the New Agrarians, and a double bill with his daughter Grace Pettis.

Pettis&#x27; songs have been covered by artists like Dar Williams (&quot;Family&quot; on &quot;Mortal City&quot;), Garth Brooks (&quot;You Move Me&quot; on &quot;Sevens&quot;), Dion &amp; the Belmonts, Sara Groves, Randy Stonehill, Pat Alger, and others. Pettis himself has covered one of Mark Heard&#x27;s songs on every album since 1993. These are: &quot;Nod Over Coffee&quot; on &quot;Chase the Buffalo&quot;; &quot;Satellite Sky&quot; on &quot;Making Light of It&quot;; &quot;Tip of My Tongue&quot; on &quot;Everything Matters&quot;, &quot;Rise from the Ruins&quot; on &quot;State of Grace&quot;, &quot;Another Day in Limbo&quot; on &quot;Great Big World&quot;; and &quot;Nothing but the Wind&quot; on &quot;That Kind of Love&quot;. Pettis&#x27; cover of &quot;Nod Over Coffee&quot; also appeared on a 1994 tribute album to Heard entitled &quot;Strong Hand of Love&quot;.

On November 15, 2018, Pettis announced a January 2019 release of &quot;Father&#x27;s Son&quot;, his first new album in nearly 10 years, on Compass Records.
